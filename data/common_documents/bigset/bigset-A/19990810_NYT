DODGERS CRUSH METS, 9-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The game was about 10 minutes old and Orel Hershiser
could already hear boos floating around Shea Stadium on Monday
night. Four of the first five Dodgers reached base against him, two
scored and the fans who wanted to see the Mets remain in first
place for another night were agitated. Obviously, they were a bit
antsy, too.
</P>
<P>
   These fickle fans refused to give Hershiser or the Mets a free
pass, not even for one inning. So they booed in the first, they
booed again in the third and they waited to see if Hershiser would
relax or if the Mets would respond against Kevin Brown. Forget it
on both questions. Perhaps the fans were prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets wound up succumbing to a dominant Brown and the
Dodgers, 9-2, on what was a seriously forgettable night. Why? Let
the Mets list the reasons. They sputtered to their third straight
loss, they dropped out of first place in the National League East
by a half-game behind the Atlanta Braves and they slipped to a
half-game edge over the Cincinnati Reds for the wild-card berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the end of a long, great streak,'' Hershiser said after
the Mets lost three straight for the first time since their
infamous eight-game losing streak two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Mets uncorked a streak of 40 victories in 55
games through Friday, the run did not build a hefty cushion in the
division. So there is cause for concern whenever the Mets lose
three straight, especially to a team that has been as disappointing
and deplorable as the Dodgers have this season.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, when Brown is pumping his hard sinker and barreling
through any tight spots, the Dodgers become quite respectable. That
happened on Monday night as Hershiser dumped the Mets in a hole
with five ineffective innings and then Brown and the Mets' bullpen
kept piling on more dirt.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets essentially had two opportunities to score against
Brown, and the $105 million man stifled them both times. Rey
Ordonez reached on an error in the third inning and made it to
third with two outs, but Edgardo Alfonzo grounded out. John Olerud
began the fourth with a single and Robin Ventura ripped a one-out
single, but Brown retired the next two batters on groundouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets did not manage another base runner off Brown, who
allowed no runs and two hits in seven innings while striking out
three and walking one. As Brown warmed up for the eighth, he tossed
a fastball that soared about 10 feet over catcher Todd Hundley's
head, looked down at his hand and then left because of a blister.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Borbon replaced Brown and Ordonez singled and Shawon
Dunston doubled, giving the Mets as many hits in two at-bats off
Borbon as they had mustered in 25 against Brown. Alfonzo's
sacrifice fly scored the Mets' first run. The second scored on
Dunston's single in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser was so inconsistent in the first inning that Dan
Murray, the rookie who was called up from ClassAAA Norfolk to
replace the injured Rick Reed on the roster on Monday, was warming
up and poised to make his major league debut. Mark Grudzielanek
singled, Jose Vizcaino walked and Eric Karros and Devon White
stroked one-out run-scoring singles to put the Dodgers ahead, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser kept himself in the game by getting Adrian Beltre on a
pop-up with the bases loaded to end what could have been an awful
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was apparent that Hershiser was not sharp against his
former team. Singles by Gary Sheffield and White and Hershiser's
third walk of the game to Raul Mondesi loaded the bases in the
third. Hundley smacked a grounder to first base that glanced off
Olerud's glove as he stretched to his right. While Olerud recovered
to nab an out at first, Sheffield eased in with the third run.
After intentionally walking Beltre, Hershiser ended his second of
three innings with the bases loaded by retiring Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser gave up three runs on six hits and four walks, but the
score was only 3-0 when he left. The bullpen did the rest of the
damage. Billy Taylor made his first appearance since botching his
first save opportunity on Saturday and admitting that he was
nervous. Taylor faced four batters and was bruised for Beltre's
double and Grudzielanek's triple, leaving the mound to boos for the
second time in three days.
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell replaced Taylor and allowed a two-run double to
Karros that increased the Dodgers' bulge to 6-0, and then Murray
was blitzed for three more runs in a dreary debut. So the game that
started with boos ended in a loss for the Mets, on the field and in
the standing.

EVEN A SUBDUED VENTURA GRABS ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ To understand Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, it
helps to remember the life of a professional wrestler. One day,
you're defending justice. The next, you're blindsiding someone with
a folding chair.
</P>
<P>
   Roles change in a heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   This week in St. Louis, Ventura continues to show how
effortlessly he alternates between the larger-than-life style of
wrestler and the reserved style of chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura is the big name at the National Governors' Association
meeting, which ends today. But he has managed to keep a remarkably
low profile.
</P>
<P>
   He ambled into meetings quietly, wearing a crisp suit and
occasionally donning glasses to scan policy documents.
</P>
<P>
   From Ventura's subdued manner, it's hard to believe that he will
be the guest referee Aug. 22 at a wrestling free-for-all called
``SummerSlam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People still get a chuckle out of him, but he wants to be
taken seriously by other governors and his colleagues,'' said David
Erickson, co-publisher of MN-Politics.com, an Internet political
magazine. ``With Ventura, you have to separate his public persona
from his governorship.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from Ventura's first governors' meeting, where
his colleagues' staffers hounded him for autographs and he wore a
buckskin coat while booming bombastic to the Washington media.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Ventura makes an impression.
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday's plenary session, heads turned as Ventura asked
loudly (for him, a whisper) where he was supposed to sit.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura took his spot next to Gov. Bill Graves of Kansas, whose
eyeglasses made him look even more bookish than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Before the governors could begin their discussion on education,
a couple of preteens shyly asked Ventura for a photo, bypassing
other governors who hadn't starred with Arnold Schwarzenegger or
been depicted as action figures.
</P>
<P>
   In one touching moment, Ventura presented a posthumous award
from the governors' association to Samuel Costa, who ran a dance
company in the Twin Cities. Ventura warmly smiled at Costa's
fiancee, whispering words of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   When Ventura went to shake hands with Costa's family in the
crowd, a loved one with tears in his eyes clutched Ventura's
forearm for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   From that meeting, Ventura attended a session with the
governors' Natural Resources Committee. He listened intently as
commerce officials discussed the salmon population in Canadian
rivers and other arcane topics.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota officials have praised Ventura's willingness to
educate himself about state government and the issues. He soberly
read his State of the State address with no scowls or one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   But Graves couldn't help laughing when asked about Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse is...he is an interesting person. I like Jesse,'' Graves
said. ``Like a lot of new governors, he spends a lot of time
sitting quietly, listening and absorbing the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He obviously still has a lot of professional wrestler in him,
especially when he's making a point,'' Graves added. ``But whatever
his past, be it wrestling, acting, or as a Navy SEAL, he has a huge
responsibility like all of us. And he appears to be taking his job
very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say Ventura is turning Minnesota into a mockery
with his outlandish appearances on the late-night talk shows and
his embarrassingly frank autobiography, I Ain't Got Time to Bleed.
</P>
<P>
   Even skeptical constituents acknowledge that Ventura has emerged
as a credible political spokesman and leader of the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here has been waiting for him to put his foot in his
mouth once again,'' said Steven Smith, a political science
professor at the University of Minnesota. ``But he's been
reasonably careful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Minnesotans are pleasantly surprised at how he's handled
himself on national television and at various national events. He's
tried to leave the wrestler at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Ventura can't help but attract attention.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton lingered with Ventura as he worked the room
after a midday speech Sunday. Eavesdroppers said the two chatted
about wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Before the day was over, a photo of the two political
personalities had been posted on newspaper Internet sites across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   When the governors visited a St. Louis elementary school, the
local newspaper chose to illustrate the story with a photo of
Ventura mischievously displaying a drawing he made.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's events at the governors' conference featured a meeting
with an information technology task force and a barbecue at Grant's
Farm.
</P>
<P>
   But Ventura planned to skip the barbecue for more pressing
business.
</P>
<P>
   He was scheduled to appear in Chicago on the wrestling program
``Raw'' to hype his referee gig later this month.
</P>
<P>
   As the World Wrestling Federation's Web site breathlessly
proclaimed: ``Jesse promised to lay down the law regarding the
Stone Cold vs. Triple H main event and the question is: Will he
start tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the responsibilities of a governor never end.
</P>
<P>
   Especially this governor.

HEAT WAVE LEAVES SOME QUESTIONING DEREGULATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Leon Daggett could hardly believe what he was
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The general manager of the Board of Public Utilities knew he
would be spending some serious money. It was going to be a hot July
day, and the utility would have to buy wholesale electricity to
replace power from a BPU power plant that was out of commission.
</P>
<P>
   On the telephone was one of Daggett's employees telling him the
price would be $2,000 a megawatt _ nearly 200 times more than if
the BPU plant had generated it. The total bill would be $1.4
million for the day.
</P>
<P>
   It was an astounding figure and one Daggett wished he could
reject. But there was really no choice. He envisioned an elderly
person in some steamy apartment without electricity to run an air
conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough decision and it was an easy decision,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The heat wave is over, and prices for wholesale electricity that
spiked as high as $9,500 a megawatt have dropped back to double
digits. Utilities largely have returned to normal operations.
</P>
<P>
   But emotions still run strong, with some taking the experience
of those hot days as further proof of the pitfalls of deregulation.
There are even a few calls to put price caps back on wholesale
prices, though a reversal of their mid-1990s deregulation is
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   As expensive as they were for some utilities, the July price
spikes and some higher wholesale prices in spring 1998 have already
begun to do their job by sparking the construction of more power
plants. More supply will mean more stable prices, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that despite setting records for electricity
use in late July, the demand for power in the region was met. But
it was close, and many utilities had to issue calls for
conservation.
</P>
<P>
   The persistent heat wave tightened supplies more than expected.
The loss of a big plant or two could have produced a real crisis.
</P>
<P>
   That point was brought home last week when the Wolf Creek
nuclear plant had to shut down because of the failure of a water
valve. Fortunately, the weather was cooler by then, and the plant
was back up in a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system held together, but it was a lot closer than a lot
of us would have thought,'' said Larry Holloway, chief of energy
operations for the Kansas Corporation Commission, which still
regulates retail prices paid by utility customers.
</P>
<P>
   Left behind were some big bills, however. Kansas City Power &AMP;
Light Co. spent an extra $18 million for wholesale power to help
fill the gap caused by the loss of its Hawthorn 5 plant earlier
this year in a explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say it was an economist's dream,'' said Bernie
Beaudoin, president of KCP&AMP;L, which doesn't expect to recover the
money from customers.
</P>
<P>
   With Hawthorn 5, KCP&AMP;L could have profited from wholesale power
sales. Many utilities did this year, including Western Resources
Inc., which had all its plants running and power to spare.
Marketers of power, such as UtiliCorp United subsidiary Aquila
Energy, also are expected to do well financially.
</P>
<P>
   Making the wholesale markets an economist's dream _ or something
approaching that _ has been the goal since the mid-1990s when
federal officials took price controls off wholesale electricity.
The idea was that free markets could do a better job of ensuring
ample supplies of power.
</P>
<P>
   If additional supplies were needed, the wholesale market would
signal the need through higher prices. That would encourage the
construction of more generators.
</P>
<P>
   But the change can be jarring. Some utilities said that last
year when wholesale prices spiked they sold electricity to other
utilities at below market rates. This year, when they had to buy
electricity, the favor wasn't returned, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Miller, a senior manager for Sunflower Electric Power
Corp., which supplies electricity to cooperatives in western
Kansas, said the shift in tone is undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like who can cheat who the most,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such strong words are sparked in part by how important wholesale
electricity has become for the utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale electricity, which basically comes from the surplus
utilities can make available, can be bought directly from a
utility, through brokers or middlemen, and from exchanges that sell
electricity offered by several utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale power also can be bought through long-term contracts,
but quick purchases of the sort needed last month can be made for a
day or even by the hour.
</P>
<P>
   Buying the power is only part of the job. It also has to be
delivered, which can be tricky especially when it's coming from
several states away. The job requires a deft touch, because
transmission lines can become overloaded.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Energy Information Administration says that at least
on paper there appears to be enough capacity to meet demand. But
there have been some close calls, including the heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   And suspicions of manipulation persist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a greed factor going on,'' said Keith Querry, business
manager of Local 53 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, which represents some workers at BPU and Independence
Power &AMP; Light.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do? Americans can expect to see more peddling of
products such as one offered by Aquila Energy to hedge electricity
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Sunflower Electric Power in Hays, Kan., took out what is thought
to be one of the first insurance policies in the country to help
pay for wholesale power in case one of its plants was disabled.
</P>
<P>
   There also may be more calls for allowing electric utilities to
automatically pass on to customers those prices for higher electric
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Americans can expect to see more power plants. Dave Penn, deputy
director of the American Public Power Association, which represents
city-owned utilities, said in the end more capacity will come.
</P>
<P>
   But as America goes toward even more deregulation in utilities,
he offers this cautionary note.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something happens to your electricity, you don't call the
stock exchange,'' Penn said.

BROWNS TOP COWBOYS, 20-17, IN HALL OF FAME GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Ohio _ The Browns' return to football was more of a
celebration than a game. It featured the glare and spectacle of
``Monday Night Football.'' Loud fighter jets flew overhead before
the game. Fireworks exploded at halftime. Dancers danced and shook
big, colorful stars. Each of the five Hall of Fame inductees from
the Class of 1999 attended, and so did a record crowd of 25,156 at
Fawcett Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But there was football to be played. And the Browns decided they
would cap the evening in style.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland did, winning by 20-17 over the Dallas Cowboys in the
annual Hall of Fame preseason game on Phil Dawson's 20-yard field
goal at 6 minutes 54 seconds of overtime. Cleveland had made it
17-17 on Dawson's 23-yard field goal with 5:49 left in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The first half featured 31 points scored and the debut of Tim
Couch, the Browns' heralded rookie quarterback, the No. 1 overall
pick of the draft. He tossed his first pro touchdown pass, albeit
preseason, on a 24-yard strike to the rookie receiver Kevin Johnson
from Syracuse. (Johnson was the Browns' second-round draft pick
last April.)
</P>
<P>
   Couch was prepared and poised in his debut, passing for 88 yards
in the first half and completing 9 of 10 attempts. He finished 11
of 17 for 137 yards with no interceptions and with a long pass of
31 yards. Ty Detmer was the starter.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas started shakily.
</P>
<P>
   It fumbled a snap in its first possession, allowed a touchdown
on Cleveland's first possession, committed a holding penalty on the
ensuing kickoff and then quickly punted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't like to see that many penalties in any game, so that
was something I wasn't pleased with,'' said Chan Gailey, the Dallas
head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Dallas began to mesh.
</P>
<P>
   It scored the final points of the half on a 49-yard field goal
with only 3 seconds remaining. Before that, the Cowboys caught the
Browns on the backup Jason Garrett's touchdown passes of 35 and 24
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas looked quick against the run, hesitant against the pass,
adequate running the ball and solid passing it. Cleveland looked
stout against the run, shaky defending the pass, adequate running
the ball and promising passing it.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the Browns fans inside the stadium and the hundreds
of others outside who came without tickets, the Browns could do no
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Doc Wingerter, along with his brother, Jamie, were among the
fortunate to gain entry. Not so, though, for the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, I had season tickets to the Browns for their
last seven years,'' Wingerter said. ``I was there when they played
their last game in `95, against the Bengals, I think. I don't quite
remember, because I got drunk that day at the game so I could try
to forget the Browns were leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hungry for football here. It's always been a blue-collar
town that's loved its football all the way back to the great
Steelers-Browns games. And it's great the Browns are coming out of
the chute in the regular season against the Steelers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Wingerter said: ``I'd like to see them win their division
and make the playoffs this year. That might not be realistic. I'd
take them winning half their games.''
</P>
<P>
   One man who stood proudly while watching the Browns' return was
Hanford Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon played cornerback for the Browns from 1981 through 1989.
He still lives in Cleveland and watched the Browns come and go. The
old Browns were known for their Dawg Pound _ their tough stadium
and lively crew of fans _ and it was Dixon who started the name.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played, we didn't have a great defensive line,'' Dixon
said. ``We had a strong secondary, though. I started thinking of
something to get the defensive line going. I thought of a dog
chasing a cat. I told the linemen to think of chasing the
quarterback that way. I started barking at them and they barked
back. And then the fans got into it and the whole thing took off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's phenomenal, a great feeling to see the team back now and
to see that new stadium they have. When I played in old Cleveland
Stadium, the facilities were so bad, especially in the visiting
locker room, that I was embarrassed to go over and visit friends
from other teams. They have a state-of-the-art facility now.
Everyone is proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman said, ``It's good to see the Dawg
Pound back in the NFL.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Baseball cards _ once the province of kids with
shoe-box collections _ have lost their gloss and appeal more today
to future investment bankers than future big leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   That's the word from many industry analysts and Southern
California dealers who say overproduction, an investment mentality
and greed are threatening a hobby that exploded into a
billion-dollar industry in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball cards have become pricier and more high-tech. Companies
now market over 50 varieties of cards a year, and many use gimmicks
such as pieces of jerseys and bats _ even sprinkles of ballfield
dirt _ to drum up interest.
</P>
<P>
   Still, overall sales have plummeted. Total sports card sales hit
$1.2billion in 1991, when baseball had the lion's share of the
collectible cards market; in 1998, total sales were less than half
that.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's home-run race revived interest in the industry, but
while cards for top stars such as Ken Griffey Jr., Mark McGwire and
Sammy Sosa have gained in value since the lockout, dealers and
analysts say the market remains deeply troubled.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Chesler, owner of Perfect Game in Santa Clarita, north of
Los Angeles, said the aggressive product expansion that companies
had hoped would revive the industry has left dealers, and many
collectors, drowning in cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a ridiculous amount of cards,'' he said. ``This year
is especially bad.''
</P>
<P>
   And analysts say an emerging market called ``grading'' _ a
process that began as a counterfeiting countermeasure _ is now
pushing prices into unhealthy territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is certainly languishing,'' said Bob Lemke,
senior price guide analyst for Krause Publications Inc. in
Wisconsin. ``Major events like the home-run race last year, they
attract attention to those individuals, but they don't seem to have
done anything to pull the rest of the market with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry is no stranger to big swings.
</P>
<P>
   A wave of speculation drove the market into a frenzy in 1991,
with collectors buying box after box of cards on the assumption
that prices could head only one way: up.
</P>
<P>
   When speculation met reality, and thousands tried to dump their
cards onto a saturated market, the market plummeted. The labor
unrest in 1994 accelerated the decline, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   According to Scott Kelnhofer, editor of Card Trade Magazine, the
new sports card market generated about $400 million in retail sales
last year, about one-third of the 1991 peak.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball cards suffered disproportionately, Kelnhofer said,
dropping from about 90 percent of the overall market in 1990 to
roughly 40 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken Jr. started the baseball card recovery with his 1995
quest for the record for the most consecutive games played, and the
Sosa-McGwire home-run contest last year solidified the gains.
</P>
<P>
   But the recovery has been shallow, says Lemke.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the broad-based gains that dealers and collectors saw
in the 1980s, Lemke said players and manufacturers are
concentrating on star players' cards and rookie cards, ignoring the
rest of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Companies also have created a scarcity of certain cards by
releasing limited runs and, in some cases, creating just one card
of a particular kind. These rare, randomly inserted ``chase'' cards
are often far more valuable than the price of a pack of cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the only cards that seem to have good cash value are the
rare inserts, the most high-tech of the cards,'' Lemke said.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers say the emphasis on value has turned some young
collectors into young speculators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids you'd think would be buying them just because they
like the players (instead) buy them and rush to the price guide,''
said Alex Sawchak, manager of Porky's Baseball Cards and Stuff in
North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got the kids saving up money for the premium packs
because they know they're worth more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``chase'' card phenomenon, which grew dramatically in the
mid-'90s, has even spurred lawsuits by older collectors and the
parents of younger collectors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most advanced cases, in U.S. District Court in San
Diego, accuses Carlsbad card manufacturer Upper Deck Co. of running
an illegal gambling enterprise that targets children.
</P>
<P>
   But some in the industry say the health of the actual sport of
baseball is more important than the marketing of its cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stronger the game of baseball is, the stronger the hobby
is,'' said Rich Klein, a baseball price guide analyst for
Dallas-based Beckett Publications.
</P>
<P>
   Some collectors agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think McGwire and Sosa last year, and Ken Griffey Jr.,
really brought a lot of people back into the market,'' said Brock
Coleman, a resident of suburban North Hills who has collected cards
for about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman also has seen how the new market is driving up prices. A
Griffey Jr. card that he had considered putting on layaway earlier
this month already has increased from $150 to $200, Coleman said.

<P>
   &UR; !text! &LR; MANHATTAN BEACH _ Alexandra Stevenson was gaily
recounting her recent sit-down interview with Barbara Walters, the
high priestess of television confessionals.
</P>
<P>
   Being on the receiving end of Walters' questions is akin to
standing on the other side of the net from someone intent on
lobbing you into submission.
</P>
<P>
   Walters can inch the most accomplished, competent people into a
corner without breaking a sweat. She has worn down five-star
generals and Hollywood headliners and heads of state. Kleenex ought
to sponsor her one- and two-hour specials for all the tears shed by
her guests under the guise of intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson, who plays Anke Huber in a first-round match today at
the Acura Classic, hasn't been in celebrity's crosshairs long. No
matter. She had Walters' game down pat.
</P>
<P>
   So before the cameras started rolling, Stevenson fired a
preemptive volley. ``You always make everyone cry after 45
minutes,'' the 18-year-old told Walters as they settled into their
seats. ``Well, you're not going to make me cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Walters drew a lot of giggles out of Stevenson but
not one tear. The newly minted pro didn't get watery eyes when
Walters wondered if Stevenson missed having a dad to share in her
successes or wished to know her biological father, former NBA star
Julius Erving, at least a wee bit better than do his fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. No,'' Stevenson replied in a voice so breezy she could
have been rejecting a diet soda instead of a basic human instinct.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't every little girl try, however subconsciously, to put
the sparkle in her daddy's eye? There must be something to
father-daughter bonding or they wouldn't have invented baby
bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, the metaphysical formula is lost on Stevenson,
who reiterated Monday that she doesn't care if she never sees
Erving again. (He has supported her financially, but their only
meeting came when she was 8 and she joined a long line of fans
waiting for his autograph at a basketball camp.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't reached out to me in 18 years, so why should he
start now?'' Stevenson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the next breath, she complimented a television reporter on
her designer platform sandals.
</P>
<P>
   She might get caught flat-footed on the court more than she'd
like, but Stevenson moves nimbly in the interview room.
</P>
<P>
   Her easy maneuvering around such a piercingly personal matter as
her parentage, in her prime-time interview with Walters and again
on Monday with local reporters, is as impressive in one so young as
her velvety one-handed backhand.
</P>
<P>
   As with that stroke, which she developed under the watchful eye
of Dr. Pete Fischer, her volleys with the media have the polish
that can only come with hours of diligent practice.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear Craig Kardon is not her only coach. Stevenson's
mother Samantha has been a sportswriter for three decades. She has
schooled Alexandra well. Only a journalist's daughter would
volunteer the pearls that writers are constantly diving for.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson was speaking breathlessly about how her life has
changed since she became the first qualifier to advance to the
semifinals at Wimbledon _ and the first child of a sports icon to
be outed at at a Grand Slam event _ when she blurted out, unbidden,
that she had ``a funny story.''
</P>
<P>
   A dozen pens snapped to attention. Was Stevenson going to
divulge a chance meeting with Erving? Did she run into some
Hollywood hunk at the Viper Room? Inquiring minds couldn't wait to
know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at a restaurant last night,'' Stevenson said, giggling,
``and this average Joe guy said, `I never watch women's tennis.
You've got me watching women's tennis. I'm coming to your match
(today) so you better play well.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson isn't naive. She knows her bloodlines are like Anna
Kournikova's beauty: a magnet for the fringe fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people recognize me because of the other subject,''
Stevenson said, alluding to Erving. ``But I wouldn't be here if it
wasn't about tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Stevenson handles the most intrusive questions like a
wily veteran, it's easy to forget she has been a pro for only three
months. Brandi Chastain probably has been wearing the same sports
bra for longer than that.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson deserves time and space to get comfortable in her new
life. Forget about being Julius Erving's daughter. Do you know how
hard it is to be a teen waiting for a dreamy boy to call?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the cell phone happens to ring,'' Stevenson said midway
through her session with the media, ``I have to answer it.''
</P>
<P>
   She was hoping to hear from Collin Smith, a beach volleyball
player she met earlier this month at the Pan American Games in
Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
   When she talked about him, her face lit up.You should know,
Stevenson considers him to be  &UR; !ital! &LR; the &UR; !off! &LR;  discovery of her
summer. &QL;

LOS ANGELES: Coleman said. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the country's card manufacturers also have launched their
own efforts to revive the market.
</P>
<P>
   Besides inserts, companies have created lines of cards with
features such as glossy prints, die cutting, chrome finishing and
foil stamping. Each of the four licensed companies _ Fleer/SkyBox
International, Topps Co., Upper Deck and Pacific Trading Cards
Inc._ now has several product lines, ranging from the base line,
traditional cards to high-end, high-cost premium cards that can
cost upward of $6 a pack.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two months alone companies have released roughly 20
new baseball card products, Klein said. That's nearly twice as many
as were available all of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of cards has made it nearly impossible to collect full
sets, discouraging some traditional collectors.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents say flashier cards and a wider variety have
brought young people into the market and retained them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better now, because cards are nicer and there's more
variety,'' said Don Rollins, 16, a Santa Clarita collector.
``There's a bigger possibility that something's going to meet your
tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   Grading, a process in which a company grades a card's quality on
a scale of 1 to 10 or 1 to 100, also has taken off since the
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   The grading industry's largest firm, Newport-based Professional
Sports Authenticator, now processes more than 100,000 cards a
month. Last year it averaged 40,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The company charges as little as $8 and as much as $100,
depending on a card's value and expected turnaround time.
</P>
<P>
   By inserting a third-party analysis into card buying, grading
has paved the way for another growing trend in the industry:
Internet trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grading gives you a lot of comfort trading on the Internet,''
said Klein, the Beckett analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Grades also have led to a pricing boom for highly rated cards.
For example, a mint condition Griffey Jr. rookie card can sell for
several times more than its price guide value.
</P>
<P>
   Card collector Howard Stevens of suburban Van Nuys said dealers
have taken advantage of the system to exaggerate the scarcity of
cards and inflate prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about authenticity anymore,'' he said. ``It's
basically about greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Other skeptics such as Harry Rinker, a collectibles analyst and
head of the Rinker Enterprises research center, say the sports card
industry _ with grading, enforced scarcity and investment focus _
is creating a price bubble that eventually will burst.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the market maintains its recent price gains, he
said, it threatens the core of the hobby itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody trades anymore, except for cash,'' he said. ``When you
teach kids to look at these as investments, you destroy the joy of
owning them.''

EDITORIAL: FOOD SAFETY CONFUSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 10:
</P>
<P>
   A year ago the National Academy of Sciences warned that the
current governmental structure for protecting the public from
unsafe or mislabeled food was a fragmented mess. Responsibility for
administering the dozens of laws concerning food safety is
scattered among a dozen different agencies, each with a different
approach to its regulatory mission. The resulting gaps and
inefficiencies impede a rational deployment of inspectors and other
resources, thereby jeopardizing the nation's public health.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department, for example, is charged with
overseeing meat and poultry safety, while the Food and Drug
Administration regulates fish. Setting safety standards for milk
and eggs is the FDA's bailiwick. But once a cow is slaughtered for
meat, or eggs are processed to make other foods, regulatory
authority shifts to Agriculture. Although about two-thirds of the
outbreaks of food-borne illness can be traced to foods regulated by
the FDA, Agriculture's food safety budget is more than twice as
large.
</P>
<P>
   The solution proposed by the Academy and a long line of experts
going back to a 1969 White House Conference on Food is to
consolidate responsibility for food safety in a single governmental
authority. A promising measure pending in Congress _ the Safe Food
Act of 1999 _ would achieve this sensible goal by replacing the
present regulatory jumble with a streamlined system under the
authority of a new independent federal agency. Better coordination
among existing food safety agencies, while it would be an advance,
is no substitute.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing in the Senate last week, the director of the
General Accounting Office division concerned with food and
agriculture issues, Lawrence Dyckman, warned that ``fundamental,
long-lasting improvements in food safety'' are ``unlikely'' until
the current patchwork food safety system is changed to one that is
uniform and risk-based. But top officials of the FDA and the
Agriculture Department expressed no sense of urgency. They said the
idea was still under consideration by the President's Council on
Food Safety, which plans to issue its formal recommendation a year
from now.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has done much to improve food safety
inspections. But further streamlining is clearly in order.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Baseball cards _ once the province of kids with
shoe-box collections _ have lost their gloss and appeal more today
to future investment bankers than future big leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   That's the word from many industry analysts and Southern
California dealers who say overproduction, an investment mentality
and greed are threatening a hobby that exploded into a
billion-dollar industry in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball cards have become pricier and more high-tech. Companies
now market over 50 varieties of cards a year, and many use gimmicks

<P>
   Other skeptics such as Harry Rinker, a collectibles analyst and
head of the Rinker Enterprises research center, say the sports card
industry _ with grading, enforced scarcity and investment focus _
is creating a price bubble that eventually will burst.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the market maintains its recent price gains, he
said, it threatens the core of the hobby itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody trades anymore, except for cash,'' he said. ``When you
teach kids to look at these as investments, you destroy the joy of
owning them.''

EDITORIAL: WOES OF THE LONG ISLAND RAIL ROAD
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 10:
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island Rail Road operates the nation's largest suburban
commuter line in a complicated and unforgiving environment. Most of
its nine branches on Long Island converge on one station at
Jamaica, Queens. From there its trains must funnel into and out of
Manhattan through four tunnels, two of them shared with Amtrak, and
can linger only a few minutes at Amtrak's Penn Station before they
must pull out to make room for the next train. These conditions and
bottlenecks cause congestion that defies easy solution. But they
should not be used as an excuse to be lethargic about simpler
problems the LIRR can deal with to head off the growing
disenchantment of riders.
</P>
<P>
   The myriad problems of the LIRR were recently explored in The
Times by David Halbfinger. The most critical problem is a decrepit
fleet of coaches that was ordered more than three decades ago,
during the administration of Gov. Nelson Rockefeller. Most of these
cars have not received adequate overhauls or maintenance. The
result is a high frequency of breakdowns, far worse than on the
LIRR's sister agency, the Metro-North Railroad. These problems
should eventually be mitigated by the acquisition of new coaches,
but the first set of new equipment is not expected to arrive until
March 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile other aggravating problems, such as litter in coaches
and cars without functioning air-conditioning units, can surely be
eased by more aggressive management. There is no good reason that
it should take several days to discover air-conditioning systems
that are not working, and many more days to get around to fixing
them. Nor is the short turnaround time for trains at Penn Station
adequate excuse for failing to clean the cars elsewhere on their
routes. Even the frequency of breakdowns might be eased with
renewed emphasis on preventive maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki ought to bring pressure to bear on the LIRR,
and the railroad's president, Thomas Prendergast, ought to retrain
or replace his line managers when they fail to perform well. New
rolling stock, signals and track, dependent on adequately funded
capital programs, will take years to have an effect on congestion.
But progress on lesser problems is well within the power of
Prendergast and Pataki.

INTERNET `PIONEER' WINS AUCTION FOR DRUG.COM NAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY   AND ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Is it Al Gore or maybe Bill Gates?
</P>
<P>
   Drugs.com, the latest high-profile Internet domain name to be
put up for sale, has been auctioned off for $823,456 to a
soon-to-be-identified ``pioneer'' of the World Wide Web, auction
broker GreatDomains.com announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   GreatDomains, in a move that appears calculated to stir up
further interest following last week's auction, said it will unveil
the name of the buyer Friday at a news conference in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The successful bidder is a well-known player in the Internet
who wishes to keep his identity confidential until the press
conference,'' Jeffrey Tinsley, chief executive officer of
GreatDomains.com, said in a prepared statement. ``I can say that
his impact on the Internet is ubiquitous.''
</P>
<P>
   GreatDomains, based in suburban Chatsworth, said the buyer, who
is traveling internationally until Friday, also will appear at the
event and unveil his plans for using drugs.com. The name currently
exists only as a site address owned by 22-year-old Internet
entrepreneur Eric MacIver of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   MacIver, operator of five-employee Web site designer Sandline
Productions, bought the name in May with the goal of opening an
online pharmacy. But then he decided to put the name up for sale
with a $260,000 asking price.
</P>
<P>
   MacIver said Monday that he will use the auction proceeds to
triple the size of Sandline over the next three months and open a
Web-based bed-and-bath store in the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   MacIver and several analysts had predicted the bid for drugs.com
_ which receives more than 4,000 hits per day even though no site
actually exists _ could top $1 million because of the potential for
selling prescription and over-the-counter drugs on the Internet.
Upstarts such as drugstore.com and PlanetRX.com already have
started trying to snag Web-savvy customers seeking discounts and
convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the notion of a million-dollar sale for a Web site
is not far-fetched since a similar name with high a recognition
factor _ wallstreet.com _ sold in May to an online casino for $1.03
million. But MacIver said Monday that he was not disappointed the
price couldn't reach seven figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really satisfied with the price,'' he said. ``I think a
lot of the drug companies that did not bid are going to be upset
with themselves a year from now when they realize what they could
have had.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have said drugs.com could be a boon to an online
pharmaceuticals retailer, but only if the company also builds the
brand with good service and a variety of products.
</P>
<P>
   MacIver, who might attend the news conference, refused to
divulge the buyer's identity.
</P>
<P>
   The price for drugs.com remained around $300,000 until the final
half hour of the auction Friday when it rose more than half a
million dollars, mostly in increments of at least $10,000. MacIver
said a group of operators of sexually themed sites tried to submit
a bid of more than $1 million but missed the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just as happy that the name went to the winning bidder,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley, whose company retains at least 7 percent of the selling
price, or $57,641, called the auction ``a huge success'' and noted
that the final part of it was carried live on the Internet.
GreatDomains plans to use the news conference to announce
subsequent auctions for loans.com and houses.com _ two of its more
than 54,000 domain names, which carry an average listing price of
$32,338.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs.com attracted dozens of obviously fake bids after it was
put up for auction in mid-July, including numerous ``Bill Gates''
offers.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs.com is officially registered to Bonnie Neubeck of
Minneapolis, who sold the name in May to MacIver in an option deal
that expires Aug. 31. ``I'd like to just be done with it,
personally,'' Neubeck said. ``I have the 31st with a big red star
on my calendar.''
</P>
<P>
   Neubeck, who registered drugs.com in 1994 through her
netprofit.com Web development company, said she had contacted a
number of drug companies about selling them the name before the
boom in Internet commerce. ``They weren't thinking ahead,'' she
said. ``They thought it was a bit crass.''

STEVENSON VOLLEYS ON OR OFF THE TENNIS COURT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Alexandra Stevenson was gaily
recounting her recent sit-down interview with Barbara Walters, the
high priestess of television confessionals.
</P>
<P>
   Being on the receiving end of Walters' questions is akin to
standing on the other side of the net from someone intent on
lobbing you into submission.
</P>
<P>
   Walters can inch the most accomplished, competent people into a
corner without breaking a sweat. She has worn down five-star
generals and Hollywood headliners and heads of state. Kleenex ought
to sponsor her one- and two-hour specials for all the tears shed by
her guests under the guise of intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson, who plays Anke Huber in a first-round match today at
the Acura Classic, hasn't been in celebrity's crosshairs long. No
matter. She had Walters' game down pat.
</P>
<P>
   So before the cameras started rolling, Stevenson fired a
preemptive volley. ``You always make everyone cry after 45
minutes,'' the 18-year-old told Walters as they settled into their
seats. ``Well, you're not going to make me cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Walters drew a lot of giggles out of Stevenson but
not one tear. The newly minted pro didn't get watery eyes when
Walters wondered if Stevenson missed having a dad to share in her
successes or wished to know her biological father, former NBA star
Julius Erving, at least a wee bit better than do his fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. No,'' Stevenson replied in a voice so breezy she could
have been rejecting a diet soda instead of a basic human instinct.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't every little girl try, however subconsciously, to put
the sparkle in her daddy's eye? There must be something to
father-daughter bonding or they wouldn't have invented baby
bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, the metaphysical formula is lost on Stevenson,
who reiterated Monday that she doesn't care if she never sees
Erving again. (He has supported her financially, but their only
meeting came when she was 8 and she joined a long line of fans
waiting for his autograph at a basketball camp.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't reached out to me in 18 years, so why should he
start now?'' Stevenson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the next breath, she complimented a television reporter on
her designer platform sandals.
</P>
<P>
   She might get caught flat-footed on the court more than she'd
like, but Stevenson moves nimbly in the interview room.
</P>
<P>
   Her easy maneuvering around such a piercingly personal matter as
her parentage, in her prime-time interview with Walters and again
on Monday with local reporters, is as impressive in one so young as
her velvety one-handed backhand.
</P>
<P>
   As with that stroke, which she developed under the watchful eye
of Dr. Pete Fischer, her volleys with the media have the polish
that can only come with hours of diligent practice.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear Craig Kardon is not her only coach. Stevenson's
mother Samantha has been a sportswriter for three decades. She has
schooled Alexandra well. Only a journalist's daughter would
volunteer the pearls that writers are constantly diving for.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson was speaking breathlessly about how her life has
changed since she became the first qualifier to advance to the
semifinals at Wimbledon _ and the first child of a sports icon to
be outed at at a Grand Slam event _ when she blurted out, unbidden,
that she had ``a funny story.''
</P>
<P>
   A dozen pens snapped to attention. Was Stevenson going to
divulge a chance meeting with Erving? Did she run into some
Hollywood hunk at the Viper Room? Inquiring minds couldn't wait to
know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at a restaurant last night,'' Stevenson said, giggling,
``and this average Joe guy said, `I never watch women's tennis.
You've got me watching women's tennis. I'm coming to your match
(today) so you better play well.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson isn't naive. She knows her bloodlines are like Anna
Kournikova's beauty: a magnet for the fringe fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people recognize me because of the other subject,''
Stevenson said, alluding to Erving. ``But I wouldn't be here if it
wasn't about tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Stevenson handles the most intrusive questions like a
wily veteran, it's easy to forget she has been a pro for only three
months. Brandi Chastain probably has been wearing the same sports
bra for longer than that.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson deserves time and space to get comfortable in her new
life. Forget about being Julius Erving's daughter. Do you know how
hard it is to be a teen waiting for a dreamy boy to call?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the cell phone happens to ring,'' Stevenson said midway
through her session with the media, ``I have to answer it.''
</P>
<P>
   She was hoping to hear from Collin Smith, a beach volleyball
player she met earlier this month at the Pan American Games in
Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
   When she talked about him, her face lit up.You should know,
Stevenson considers him to be THE discovery of her summer. &QL;

ACTOR'S TV PRODUCTION COMPANY MOVES TO SAN FERNANDO VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The actor best known for portraying mailman Cliff
Clavin on ``Cheers'' has joined the growing parade of Hollywood
players setting up shop in a converted shampoo factory in the west
San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   John Ratzenberger has moved his Fiddlers Bay Entertainment Co.
into Ray-Art Studios, the 2-year-old enterprise owned by veteran
producers Robert Papazian and James Hirsch.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old actor said the move made sense because his
company is developing with Ray-Art a pair of TV series _ ``Fine
Food and Diesel'' and ``V-Cops'' _ and ``Mr. Christmas,'' a
made-for-TV film.
</P>
<P>
   Ratzenberger, who was on ``Cheers'' for all 11 of its seasons,
previously operated his production company in the Chatsworth area.
</P>
<P>
   Ray-Art operates four soundstages with 83,000 square feet and
eight offices in a two-story building on Variel Avenue. It plans to
build two or three more soundstages by next June despite a slowdown
in off-studio production because studios are spending less and
moving some productions to lower-cost Canadian locales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get plenty of inquiries, so we believe there's going to be
demand for new space,'' said manager Sean Papazian. ``People are
always going to want to shoot in Los Angeles with what we offer _ a
fair price and friendly atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ray-Art building originally was owned by Boeing Co., then
sold to Redken Shampoo, which left in 1995. Developer Robert Selan
opened a baseball training academy, then renamed it Variel Studios
and struck lease deals with several producers before selling to
Papazian and Hirsch in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ray-Art is home to Aaron Spelling's sitcom ``Charmed.'' Previous
tenants have included ``Wag the Dog,'' ``Blade'' and sitcoms
``Nothing Sacred,'' ``413 Hope Street'' and ``The New Love Boat.''
Additionally, the studio wrapped production earlier this summer on
``The Storytellers,'' a feature film it co-produced with Da'Lin
Films.

MICHAEL WILLIAMS TAKE HIS NEW-FOUND FAME IN STRIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Williams didn't know he was auditioning for a
horror film when he went to the first casting call for ``The Blair
Witch Project,'' this summer's phenomenon, but he did notice that
it was paid work _ $1,000 for being scared to tears, literally, in
a creepy stretch of the Maryland woods.
</P>
<P>
   He was just glad to have the money because there were moments
when he didn't have the $3 round-trip subway fare for another
audition. Even when the film opened in mid-July, Williams was still
making his real living moving furniture.
</P>
<P>
   So never did he imagine that the $35,000 film by two unknown
directors with three unknown actors would earn $80 million, be No.
2 at the box office and land on this week's covers of Time and
Newsweek. Fortunately for Williams, his contract calls for him to
get a small percentage of the net earnings, but, in the manner of
his on-screen character, he is remarkably relaxed about when, and
how much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they're going to take care of me, and even if they
don't, I don't care,'' he said last week in his Westchester County,
N.Y., home as happily as if he had won the lottery, which for an
actor he has. ``Because you know what? I'm going to be on Jay Leno
in two weeks!''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 26, plays Mike Williams _ all three actors used their
own names _ the scaredy-cat sound man who disappears in the woods
with two other student film makers while making a documentary on
the legend of the Blair Witch. Heather Donahue, who plays the
student director, acts obsessive and obnoxious, while Joshua
Leonard, the student cameraman, is the brooder who hates Heather.
(It's not hard.) Mike, initially the film's whimpering lump,
emerges as the level-headed peacemaker, the character who often
says what the audience is thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted them to be one step removed from the characters
themselves,'' said Daniel Myrick, one of the two ``Blair Witch''
directors, who auditioned 2,000 actors for the parts. ``Mike was a
good fit for `Everyday Man' that we needed in that role.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week at his childhood home in Westchester County, Everyday
Man sat on his mother's back porch and talked about how scared he
himself became while making the movie. (He asked that his
Westchester town not be identified because some of the film's most
fanatic fans are _ How shall one put it? _ unusual.) Like the other
actors, Williams worked not from a script _ there wasn't one _ but
by improvisation and his wits.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, the directors left the three actors for six
days in a two-and-a-half-square-mile area of a Maryland state park.
The actors had with them camping gear and two cameras that they
used to film themselves, like the documentary makers they were
supposed to be. Each day in a milk crate, the directors left food,
fresh camera batteries and directions for each of the actors,
outlining in the most general terms how the characters should
develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd open it up and it would say: `OK, this is getting out of
hand. You've been hiking for two days, you haven't found the car
yet, does Heather honestly know where she's going?''' Williams
said. Or, for the climactic scene: ``Tonight you will hear Josh's
voice. Get out of the tent and follow it.''
</P>
<P>
   The directors, meanwhile, were lurking out of sight in the
woods, making noises in the middle of the night to scare the three
in their tent. ``Some nights you'd wake up and say, `I know it's
them out there, so I'm just going to lie here a little longer and
let them run around while I muster up some fear,''' Williams said.
But by the climactic scene, when Williams followed directions to
reach an abandoned house in the woods, his fear was real.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know we were coming upon it,'' he said. ``So that
was pretty horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of that scene, after six cold, stressful and hungry
days in the woods (the directors decreased the food allocation each
day, to make the actors as desperate as their characters), Williams
collapsed in tears, he said. ``It all just sort of came flying out
of me,'' he said. It was also, as it happened, Halloween night.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we came out of that emotional wreckness and went to Denny's
and there were all these people dressed up in Halloween costumes
looking like freaks walking on earth,'' Williams said. ``It was the
first sign of civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the eighth of nine children _ his late father was an
Exxon executive and his mother stayed home and ran the show _
played Henry Higgins in ``My Fair Lady'' in high school, graduated
in 1996 from the State University of New York at New Paltz, moved
to Queens to be closer to potential acting work and worked as an
ice-cream scooper in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Now he spends his time being interviewed, posing in trees (to go
with the woodland theme of the movie), meeting with more casting
directors than he ever dreamed of and being recognized on the
street. Not long ago he was sitting on a curb in Santa Monica,
Calif., reading a script before an audition, when a guy walked by
and said, ``Blair Witch, Dude!''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I say, `Yeah,' Williams said. ``And he says, ``Awesome!
Awesome!''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is to be married next month to Toni Batiste, a former
account executive for a Westchester shopper publication, and will
soon move to Santa Monica. So far he has no offers, but last week
he did quit his job as a furniture mover.

VALUE OF L.A. PROPERTIES SOARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Driven by a strong economy and sizzling real
estate market, property values in Los Angeles County this year
soared a combined $30 billion, or 6 percent, county Assessor
Kenneth P. Hahn reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Westlake Village led all cities in the percentage of growth in
assessed value at 13.1 percent, with property values pushed upward
by demand for single-family homes, condominiums and commercial
buildings, according to the assessor's annual roll.
</P>
<P>
   Not far behind were Hidden Hills, Calabasas and La Canada
Flintridge, all cited for significant growth in the high-end
market.
</P>
<P>
   The total assessed value of all properties in the county for
1999-2000 is $533 billion, up from $503 billion last year. The 6
percent increase was the largest since 1992, when it was 6.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy days are going to be here for a while,'' said Hahn,
predicting that the growth in value will continue.
</P>
<P>
   The increase is good for government coffers, which will fill
with the $300 million in property tax revenues that result from the
$30 billion increase.
</P>
<P>
   It also should improve local governments' bond ratings, leading
to lower interest rates that save taxpayers money, said Jack Kyser,
chief economist with the Los Angeles County Economic Development
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn's report is just one more sign ``the local economy is in
recovery mode,'' Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   With the sting of the early 1990s' recession still painful, the
county's total assessed property value slid in 1995 and 1996. But
it turned around again in 1997 and has grown ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The Antelope Valley is struggling to catch up, however. Still
emerging slowly from the blow of aerospace industry downsizing just
when housing tracts were sprouting, Lancaster and Palmdale are
among the cities still experiencing overall property devaluations.
</P>
<P>
   But ``I think they're starting to come around'' in terms of
economic strength, Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the countywide spike in total assessed value and
skyrocketing values in the luxury market, the average single-family
home in Los Angeles County still hasn't regained its 1992 value of
$237,000. The average home is now valued at $228,600.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're clearly headed in the right direction,'' said
Assistant Assessor Rick Auerbach.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn cited low interest rates, low unemployment and increased
consumer confidence in explaining the continuation of last year's
real estate boom. The strong economy produced a rise in new housing
starts, commercial construction and sales of existing properties,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stock market investors who saw remarkable gains competed for
high-end housing, helping push values up significantly in that
market segment, Hahn said.

HOLLANDSWORTH IN IDLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Todd Hollandsworth's agent, Jeff Moorad, said last
winter his client wanted to be traded, but the Los Angeles Dodgers
didn't budge on the demand because they valued the outfielder's
versatility.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also said they would get Hollandsworth more at-bats
than usual for a backup, but that hasn't happened. It could lead
Hollandsworth down a familiar path when this season expires.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson's grand plan to get Hollandsworth
350 to 400 at-bats won't materialize, and not because of injury.
The reality is that Johnson is finding it difficult to sit a
portion of his $21.5 million outfield in favor of Hollandsworth,
who makes $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can play every day, but I can only do what's being
asked of me to do,'' Hollandsworth said. ``In the offseason we'll
look at it. If the club wants me in their plans, we'll talk about
it. I'm not concerning myself with it now. You get to the offseason
and you worry about it then and see where this is going to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll talk to my family and talk to my agent and see where it
leads us to. We'll address the situation then.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth missed the equivalent of a month with injuries,
but he must average four at-bats over the remaining 50 games to get
to 350. Hollandsworth is hitting .311 in 148 at-bats and is on pace
for a 237 at-bat season.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth has also played six games at first base, but
steady Eric Karros is making $5.5 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Agonizing Adrian: Dodgers third baseman Adrian Beltre spent
most of the season flirting with .300, but his offensive production
has fallen off dramatically since the all-star break.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre is hitting .202 (18 for 89) with one homer and 12 RBI
since the break and is hitting .272 for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be more mentally than physically that he's whupped,''
hitting coach Rick Down said. ``It may be a little different
playing all these games here instead of Double-A and Triple-A. He's
thrown some at-bats away, but when the game gets deeper or on the
line, I'm confident in him. I'd be shocked if he doesn't hit .280
or .290.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Balks, walks and chalk: Lefty Carlos Perez, pitching at
Triple-A Albuquerque, allowed seven earned runs on nine hits in
five innings against Calgary. He walked one and struck out one. . .
. Eric Young went 1 for 3 for Single-A San Bernardino on Sunday and
Johnson said the plan is to activate the second baseman when the
club returns home Friday. ``Unless something happens, we'll see him
Friday,'' Johnson said. Young is set to play the next three days
with the Stampede. . . . Johnson said right-hander Mike Judd will
arrive in Montreal today in preparation for his season debut
against the Expos on Thursday. Judd is 8-7 with a 6.67 ERA at
Albuquerque. It'll be his third stint in three seasons with the
Dodgers. He pitched 22/3 scoreless innings in 1997 and had a 15.09
ERA in seven games last year. . . . Former Dodger Bobby Bonilla, on
the Mets' disabled list since July 3 with tendinitis in his left
knee, is scheduled to begin a rehab assignment Aug. 26 and will be
activated when rosters expand on Sept. 1, Mets general manager
Steve Phillips said.

L.A.'S REAL BEACH BABES, BRAWN STAR AT GUARDING LIVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERMOSA BEACH, Calif. _ They don't often break up spy rings or
capture smugglers, but the actual work of Los Angeles County
lifeguards is far more strenuous than the antics on ``Baywatch.''
</P>
<P>
   But the actual L.A. lifeguards really do seem to do their work
better than their counterparts anywhere else in the country.
Competing at Cape May, N.J. over the weekend, the L.A. team won its
13th straight national championship in the U.S. Lifesaving
Association's competition. It is the 26th top title for Los Angeles
County teams in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty big honor,'' said Mike McIndoe, a 19-year-old
from Malibu who works at Zuma Beach. ``But it was something we
expected. We worked hard for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tough,'' said McIndoe, a second-year lifeguard, who said
team members sneak in training around their 50-hour work weeks.
``We're all pretty drained. But it shows we're dedicated to the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southlanders defeated teams from around the United States,
Canada and Japan in tests of the skills that lifeguards need in
their everyday jobs. Despite what television might have you
believe, that doesn't include exposing themselves for ``Playboy''
or exposing international jewel thieves.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it means tests like the American Ironwoman competition _
a successive 150-meter run, 300-meter swim, 400-meter rescue board
paddle and 100-meter run _ which Heidi Hannenian-Kissel of Hermosa
Beach won for the second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fitness level you have to keep up is just immense,'' said
28-year-old Hannenian-Kissel, a lifeguard for five years and a
former swimmer for Northwestern University and the University of
California at Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to do on any given day might take that fitness
level, but it's more mentally taxing. We're here for eight hours,
and there's really not one second where you can't be paying
attention,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have days where you don't make any rescues,'' added team
member Jamie Orr, a 30-year-old from Hermosa Beach. ``But you have
to be ready to bust on a dime, make a 200- or 300-yard run and swim
and grab a guy who's not helping you at all and drag him to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a serious job. People think we're out here working on our
tan,'' Orr said. ``We watch 60 (million) to 80 million people here
in the summertime.''
</P>
<P>
   But they said the job gets easier with experience, and veteran
lifeguards gain almost a sixth sense for spotting trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Experience also helps in the competition, said lifeguard Capt.
Steve Moseley. The L.A. County team keeps winning partly because of
points won older or retired lifeguards who dominate the
senior-lifeguard, over-50 and over-60 categories. The team's depth
also helps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of neat,'' said section Chief Gary Crum, ``to see
all the generations together for a common goal. We had everybody
from the 18-year-olds to the 78-year-old (Paul Matthies).''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was especially sweet, coming over Monmouth County,
N.J., the team that almost snatched the title away from Los Angeles
last year _ losing by only 52 points out of 491. The Monmouth
County team was playing on its home turf and had recruited a team
of 160, including some whom Moseley called ringers: Australian
lifeguards working in New Jersey just for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were lined up ready to defeat us,'' Crum said, but L.A.
County prevailed, 674 points to 555.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles fielded a team of 54 who volunteered from the ranks
of the agency's 500 part-timers and 115 full-time lifeguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really psyched up for it,'' said Tom Seth, 31, of
Manhattan Beach. The scores were close after Friday's events, then
``everyone really rallied the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a really great trip,'' Hannenian-Kissel said. ``This
was by far the most fun. We're blessed to be in a sport where you
can go to the beach and be with your friends.''

DISNEY LOOKS TO SELL ANGELS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ According to published reports, the Walt
Disney Co. is looking into selling the Anaheim Angels only three
years after purchasing the club from Gene Autry.
</P>
<P>
   Published reports say the club is losing too much money.
According to the New York Times, one baseball official suggested
Disney's decision is based on financial losses in baseball.
However, an executive with another major-league team told the
newspaper the move is linked to Disney's multimillion-dollar
settlement in the lawsuit filed by former studio chief Jeffrey
Katzenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Angels spokesman Tim Mead had the following response to the
published reports: ``We're referring all comment to the unnamed
baseball sources . . . in the New York paper. We don't comment on
rumor and speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney purchased the Angels from Autry in 1996, paying 25
percent _ or about $30 million _ and taking over operation with the
agreement they would pay the remaining 75 percent upon Autry's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Autry died last October and Disney paid the balance.
</P>
<P>
   The team reportedly lost $11 million in 1994 and $12 million in
'95, the last two years Autry ran the club. Part of Disney's
takeover included paying $70 million of the approximate $110
million it cost to renovate the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels signed Mo Vaughn to a six-year, $80 million contract
last November, the biggest contract in club history and the
second-highest average annual salary ($13.3 million) in all of
baseball. The club's $52 million payroll this season ranks as the
13th highest among baseball's 30 teams.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the highest payroll in baseball this year is the
New York Yankees' $85 million. The Dodgers rank No. 2 at $79
million and the Montreal Expos have the smallest payroll at $17
million.
</P>
<P>
   __ Vaughn returns: Mo Vaughn will return to the lineup tonight
against the Indians after missing six games with a staph infection
in his right shin.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn hit in the batting cage for about 10 minutes, ran on a
treadmill and reported feeling no pain or swelling in the shin,
which developed the infection after he was hit by a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know what to think of it,'' Vaughn said of the
injury. ``I've never seen anything like it. I just fouled a ball
off my shin and it turned into this.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he initially felt pain in the shin, but when the
infection took hold, his entire body ached. He took antibiotics to
fight the infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad it's over and I can play again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he didn't know if he'd play first base or DH
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's game against the Indians is essentially meaningless
for the Angels. But for starting pitcher Chuck Finley, there are
things to consider:
</P>
<P>
   1) Finley is facing the Indians, the team that tried to trade
for him just before the trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   2) The Indians' starter is Mark Langston, a former teammate of
Finley's and a close friend.
</P>
<P>
   3) Finley will be a free agent at the end of the season and
every start counts, especially considering his struggles earlier in
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, Finley says he's taking it as just another
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to continue what I'm doing,'' said Finley, who
threw seven scoreless innings in his last start, Thursday against
the Red Sox. ``I don't care who it's against or whoever's coming
in. It could be against Kansas City or Milwaukee, it doesn't
matter. I'm not going to read more into it that isn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Released: The Angels made it official Monday, releasing
pitcher and Notre Dame High alum Jack McDowell and replacing him on
the roster with right-handed pitcher Lou Pote. Pote made 23 starts
for Triple-A Edmonton, going 7-9 with a 4.50 ERA and three complete
games. He'll be placed in the bullpen for now but is expected to
start at some point.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell was 0-4 with a 8.50 ERA in four starts, but manager
Terry Collins said releasing a former Cy Young Award winner isn't
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never easy to do, especially with a guy like Jack
McDowell,'' Collins said. ``I've enjoyed having him on my team as
much as any player I've had. He's been a true professional.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Angels in the outfield: The Angels' starting outfield Monday
was Garret Anderson in left, Jim Edmonds in center and Tim Salmon
in right. (Darin Erstad played first base.) It marked the first
time the Angels started that outfield all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the best outfields in the American League for
three straight years,'' said Collins. ``. . . In spring training,
we were asked over and over how we were going to handle having four
outfielders and we said we may need all four. Then we come to find
out we needed one more . . . or two more.'' &QL;

INFAMOUS COMPUTER HACKER FACES MORE PRISON TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kevin Mitnick, dubbed the world's most notorious
computer hacker, finally has been brought to justice after nearly
four years in prison. His sentence: a $4,125 fine and more prison
time until January.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of young people filled the courtroom and carried ``Free
Kevin'' signs outside the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe he has paid his debt. He has suffered enough,''
said 21-year-old supporter Maryanne DuVall. ``The government has
been way too hard on him.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer rejected the
government's request for a $1.5 million fine to pay restitution for
the estimated $80 million in damage that the Monroe High School
graduate was accused of causing with his hacking exploits.
</P>
<P>
   ``So there is no misunderstanding, Mr. Mitnick, this is a token
restitution. I know it and you know it. ... But the principle is
served,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I understand,'' Mitnick replied.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, Alan Mitnick, said he is relieved and happy the
legal battle finally has ended for his son, now 36, who began
hacking in his early teens when there were few guidelines for
talented amateur computer users.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was on the cutting edge ... and he was absolutely
mistreated by the government,'' Alan Mitnick said. ``They made him
a poster boy for their mission to set up guidelines and rules over
hacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he did it out of curiosity,'' he added. ``He never
did it to hurt anyone or make any money.''
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Painter said that,
despite the father's views, hacking is a serious crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mitnick is not the only hacker out there ... and I hope this
sends a message that anyone caught hacking risks serious
prosecution,'' Painter said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he was satisfied with the judge's restitution
order because Mitnick has agreed to turn over to his victims any
money he makes in the next seven years on books or movie deals
associated with his crime.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick's attorney Donald C. Randolph said his client's life as
a hacker is over. He asked the judge to allow Mitnick to enroll in
a 12-step program at a halfway house to help him make the
transition from prison life as he completes his 46-month sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing ended an eight-year hunt, investigation and legal
battle over Mitnick's exploits, which elevated the former San
Fernando Valley resident to hero status among the world's hacking
elite.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney said Mitnick's crimes were at least partially
obsessive-compulsive behavior. Mitnick pleaded guilty in March to
five federal counts of wire fraud and computer fraud for crimes
between 1992 and February 1995, when he was captured as the first
hacker to make the FBI's Most Wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   The prison term was determined in a plea agreement Mitnick
reached with the government in March. With time served, he could be
freed by January.
</P>
<P>
   Pfaelzer explained that, despite the government's request for
more than $1.5 million in restitution, she ordered a much lower
amount that he could realistically be forced to pay without
violating other orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to make a restitution order that is much
higher,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pfaelzer ordered Mitnick to stay away from all computer hardware
and software, cell phones, computer networks, personal information
assistants and televisions that could be used for online access.
</P>
<P>
   He is prohibited from working as a consultant to computer
companies or in any firms with access to computers.
</P>
<P>
   She also specified he may not obtain access codes, encryption
data or any altered telephone equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the order will be lifted three years after
Mitnick's release if he successfully completes supervised
probation. Meanwhile, Randolph said he will ask that Mitnick be
allowed to use computers to the extent needed for college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Mitnick wants to get a college education ... and I'm
hopeful the judge will allow him to use computers for his
education,'' Randolph said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the hearing, Pfaelzer denied defense motions to
assign a forensic economist to investigate whether the government
inflated loss figures.
</P>
<P>
   Painter said defense accusations that the loss figures were
tainted were preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nothing but a smoke screen,'' Painter said. ``The judge
denied the motion, so I won't even address the accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   Randolph also urged the judge to let Mitnick remain in the
Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles and not be transferred
to a different federal facility in San Bernardino, where he said
kosher food is not available. Mitnick is on a kosher diet, he said.
The judge left that decision to the jailers.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick's hacking exploits began when he was a student at Monroe
in North Hills and gained unauthorized access to the Los Angeles
Unified School District's computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   He was on probation for other computer crimes when he went on
what government lawyers call a cross-country hacking spree, which
climaxed when he was named as one of the FBI's Most Wanted and
ended when he was arrested in North Carolina in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   During the FBI investigation, agents tied cellular telephone
calls from Mitnick's apartment in Raleigh, N.C., to computer
intrusions in San Jose, San Francisco and San Diego. One entry
resulted in the theft of computer software worth as much as $1
million, according to federal affidavits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Mitnick admitted that he broke into a Pacific Bell
telephone computer in 1992, possessed false identification,
consorted with a convicted hacker, failed to make four required
reports to his probation officer and fled Los Angeles without
permission from the probation officer. He also admitted to being
caught with codes to use cellular telephones without paying.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick's plea and sentencing resolved federal indictments
pending in Los Angeles and San Francisco against the 36-year-old
computer hacker.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, state computer fraud charges against Mitnick were
dismissed after prosecutors said they could prove only a minor
infraction that carries a fine of $50 to $100.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick allegedly pretended to be a Department of Motor Vehicles
employee during a telephone call to get some confidential records
sent to him.

HOT DODGERS TOPPLE METS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They were the laughingstock of the league coming into
a raucous stadium filled with fans of the hottest team in baseball.
It was the set-up for one of the most horrific road trips in
memory, and the deal was nearly closed a few nights ago.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Los Angeles Dodgers sent a shock wave through the
NL East and turned the wild-card situation into disarray by winning
their third straight game against the New York Mets, 9-2 Monday at
Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly two outs from an anticipated four-game sweep on
Saturday at the hands of the Mets, the Dodgers retaliated for one
of the few times this season and knocked the Mets out of first in
the division, and out of first in the wild-card race, by winning
the final three of the four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew when the Dodgers trailed by a run in the ninth in the
second game of the series that this was possible? ``This is a good
place to play, it was good for us,'' Dodgers third baseman Adrian
Beltre said. ``When you win two or three games in a row and play
like we did, we feel we still have a chance. It's different on the
road. You feel you can play like San Diego did a few games ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson said after the Dodgers limped through
three games in Houston that playing in New York could be good for
the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the upbeat Dodgers travel to lowly Montreal, the league's
second-worst team, with a chance to gain back a little more of the
pride they frittered away before they arrived in Gotham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it takes time for new players, a new manager and new
coaches to trust each other,'' Johnson said. ``Sometimes when you
play against some tougher people, it's good for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the Mets' career leader in managerial wins, then said,
``I always like coming here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers completed their first series win in six attempts and
have a three-game winning streak for the first time since the
All-Star break. They did it by outscoring the Mets 23-5 in the last
two games and 27-6 since Saturday's seventh inning. Eric Karros'
encore to a three-RBI afternoon was two hits and four RBI on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't just go out there and lay down for anybody,''
Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield said. ``We were playing in New
York and that's something that's exciting. I'm sure they didn't
think we were going to lay down.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Dodgers also got dominant pitching. Kevin Brown followed
Darren Dreifort's overpowering performance by allowing two hits in
seven innings before leaving with a blister on his middle finger.
Brown insists he won't miss a start because of the injury and
cautioned the Dodgers not to get crazy about the three-game streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to try to build, to get some positives out of the
situation because it's been a tough year,'' Brown said.
``Hopefully, we'll get on a roll. Right now, we're looking at
trying to play for self-respect. That's all you can look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he could have continued, but Johnson said there was
no point in risking his best starter for a game the Dodgers were
controlling. Bothered by the blister since the second inning, Brown
had it drained between innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made it difficult on some of the pitches to hold on to (the
ball),'' Brown said. ``I could have stayed out there, but it
wouldn't be easy to make pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown (13-6) never gave the impression he was laboring. He
allowed both hits in the fourth inning and retired 21 of the 25
batters he faced. In retiring the last 11 batters, he allowed one
ball out of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   It was reminiscent of Brown's masterful four-hitter five days
earlier in Houston. In fact, Brown is 3-0 in his last four starts
with a 0.85 ERA, and the one game in which he didn't earn a
decision he left with a 5-1 lead in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some pretty good swings on (Brown), but he was able to
keep the ball off the barrel of the bat and weren't able to get
back in the game,'' said Mets catcher Mike Piazza, who went 3 for
15 with one RBI against his old teammates. ``I thought I had really
good swings but obviously nothing to show for it.''

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ The only thing certain about Monday's game at Turner
Field is that the Astros lost 5-3 to the Atlanta Braves.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Exactly why or how it happened was subject to debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theme of this game was our players missing signs,'' Astros
manager Larry Dierker said. ``There were quite a few missed signs.
Usually, we get 'em about half of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son's Little League team gets signs easier than we do. I
guess we're going to have to go over it one on one with guys. They
(the signs) haven't changed all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation that seemed to epitomize Monday's confusion
occurred in the eighth inning when shortstop Tim Bogar hit a
two-out single, then was stranded on first base when relief pitcher
Doug Henry struck out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said Bogar ``was supposed to go,'' meaning he expected
Bogar to attempt a stolen base, presumably so the Astros could
bring a pinch hitter to the plate with the potential go-ahead run
in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some confusion,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no confusion on Bogar's part following the game. He
was confident he knew his assignment in the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never told anything,'' said Bogar, who is 3-for-8 in
stolen-base attempts this year. ``Just knowing the game, I guess
I'm supposed to steal second so he can hit for the pitcher. I
didn't miss a sign. If he wants me to run, he should have given me
a `run' sign. Every guy on the team has a green light.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (third-base coach Mike Cubbage) gives you a sign that he
really wants you to get a good jump, and that's what (the sign) I
got. I never got a good jump, and I didn't want to get thrown out.
If they were worried about stealing a base, I'm not the guy. We had
guys on the bench who are better base-stealers than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Craig Biggio seemed to indicate the Astros put on
more plays than usual in Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do a lot of it, and then all of sudden we do it
today,'' Biggio said, adding, ``I don't think missed signs cost us
the game. I don't know about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the frustration was a tough loss, highlighted by the
first hit of rookie catcher Pascual Matos' career. His two-run
single off Henry in the eighth inning was the decisive blow in the
first game of this showdown between two playoff-contending teams.
</P>
<P>
   The loss trimmed the Astros' National League Central Division
lead to two games over Cincinnati, which beat Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros stranded 10 baserunners and left runners in scoring
position in five of the nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   The meager run support was par for the course considering it was
Chris Holt's turn in the rotation. Holt held his own in a matchup
with one-time Cy Young winner John Smoltz, but neither figured in
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have my best stuff, but I felt like I gave us a
chance to win the game, which is what I try to do every time out,''
said Holt, who allowed three runs on eight hits in 6 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Braves reliever Rudy Seanez allowed a run in relief of Smoltz,
who left with a 3-2 lead. Seanez (6-1) qualified for the win
because he was the pitcher of record on Matos' timely hit.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker pitched a scoreless ninth inning for his 23rd save.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett's RBI single gave the Astros a 1-0 lead in the
third, and Atlanta tied the score in the bottom of the inning on
Ryan Klesko's run-producing base hit.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who was 3-for-4 and extended his hitting streak to 11
games, again found himself in the middle of the action in the sixth
inning when he led off with a hit and scored on Bogar's clutch
two-out single.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves chased Holt from the game with two in the seventh.
Gerald Williams brought home one run with a sacrifice fly to center
field, and Chipper Jones' RBI single to left broke a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitch to Chipper was just a get-me-over curveball,'' Holt
said. ``He stayed back and got good wood on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros pulled even in the eighth when Everett led off with a
double, moved to third on Russ Johnson's fly to right and scored on
Paul Bako's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The inning ended, rather strangely, with Henry batting for
himself and striking out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was baffled by it,'' said Henry, who has only 15 career
at-bats. ``But I don't make those calls. They called me up there,
and I was just swinging hard just in case I hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the way the bottom of the eighth began was an indication
of how things would unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko led off with a grounder that hit first base and caromed
into right field for a double. After Henry walked Andruw Jones and
struck out Walt Weiss, Matos cracked what seemed to be a three-run
homer down the left-field line.
</P>
<P>
   After a strong protest from Bogar, Dierker and left fielder Bill
Spiers, the umpires uncharacteristically overturned the call _
determining the ball cleared the left-field wall in foul territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely foul,'' Bogar said. ``You have to commend
the umpires for changing the call in that situation. That took a
lot of guts.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a brief letdown for the crowd of 40,072, but the fans
quickly got over it when Matos poked a single through the left
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best I've felt since I've been back from the
disabled list,'' said Henry (1-2), who has allowed five runs and
five hits in his last three outings. ``I'll just have to go back to
the bullpen and figure out what the heck I've been doing wrong.''

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
CANTON, Ohio _ Although it was only a meaningless exhibition, based
on the reception they got it seemed as if the new Cleveland Browns
were involved in a playoff game.
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one had to ask the Browns' fans if they were ready for some
football. They had been ready since Art Modell moved his franchise
to Baltimore after the 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   In a break from tradition, the annual AFC-NFC Hall of Fame Game
was moved from Saturday afternoon to Monday night to take advantage
of the rebirth of the new Browns. The Dallas Cowboys, the most
popular television draw in the NFL, were brought in to participate
in what turned out to be an entertaining game that should
obliterate the preseason television ratings record.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was there a festive atmosphere at Fawcett Stadium, but
the Browns and Cowboys drew a record crowd of 25,156 that saw
Cleveland prevail 20-17 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Dawson, a rookie from Texas, won the game with a 20-yard
field goal. Dawson's 23-yard field goal in the third quarter had
tied the game at 17.
</P>
<P>
   A good time was had by all. Browns fans watched quarterback Tim
Couch, the No. 1 pick in the draft, play like a veteran after
relieving starter Ty Detmer in the second quarter. Couch led the
Browns on two scoring drives and finished 11-of-17 for 137 yards
and a touchdown before leaving after the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim didn't exceed my expectations, because I expect a lot from
him,'' Browns coach Chris Palmer said. ``He functioned well for a
rookie. He handled most of the blitzes. He certainly didn't hurt
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys fans, in the minority but still vocal as usual, went
home happy because none of Dallas' stars was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman completed nine of 11 passes for
85 yards before leaving one play into the second quarter. Emmitt
Smith carried once for no yards before departing. Michael Irvin had
two catches for 15 yards before calling it a night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They threw a lot of eight-man fronts and blitzes at us,''
Aikman said. ``I was happy with the way our guys protected. We
didn't spend a lot of time in preparation for that kind of stuff,
so you've got to be pleased with the way we handled it.``
</P>
<P>
   Even Aikman was impressed by the atmosphere and the attitude of
the Browns fans, many of whom spent most of the night barking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to see the Dawg Pound back in the NFL,'' Aikman
said. ``I thought Couch had a nice first half. He hung in the
pocket well, and he did a good job of picking up his secondary
receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey wasn't concerned about such veterans
as Aikman, Smith and Irvin. With his long injury list, Gailey
couldn't afford to see any more players go down. He did get a good
look at a lot of his young players, especially on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what some of our young defensive guys did getting to
the ball,'' Gailey said. ``Especially some of the young guys in the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he signed for so much money and has received so much
attention, Couch was eager to show his coaches and fans what he
could do. Whether throwing or running, Couch was fearless and
rambunctious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach (Palmer) told me after one of my runs that we're going
to have to practice sliding this week,'' Couch said. ``I never slid
in high school or college, but I'll try to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't nervous. I tried to stay on an even keel. I made some
positive plays, but I've got a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd got just what it wanted _ a quick Browns
touchdown to get the preseason off to an ideal start.
</P>
<P>
   On Dallas' first series, Aikman was charged with a fumble, and
Cleveland linebacker John Thierry recovered at the Dallas 27.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns got a break when Dallas was called for pass
interference in the end zone, giving Cleveland a first down at the
Dallas one. Running back Terry Kirby leaped into the end zone on
his second try, and Dawson kicked the extra point for a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first fumble, I thought we moved the ball well,''
Aikman said. ``I had a lot of time to throw. Chris (Warren) had a
few nice runs, and we moved the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   While Aikman didn't throw a touchdown pass, backup Jason Garrett
threw a pair in the second quarter. Garrett connected with MarTay
Jenkins on a 35-yard score and with Jeff Ogden on a 24-yarder.

FRAZIER UPSETS TAUZIAT
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Call Amy Frazier self-deprecating or
just plain honest. Regardless, the self-dubbed ``one-dimensional''
player only needed her lone dimension to supply the first upset to
the $520,000 Acura Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier rarely moved off the baseline and ousted fifth-seeded
Nathalie Tauziat 3-6, 7-5, 6-2 Monday in one hour, 54 minutes at
Manhattan Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Known for her steady ground strokes and love for the baseline,
Frazier quietly has become one of the hottest players on the WTA
Tour. Since Wimbledon, where 18-year-old Alexandra Stevenson
knocked her out in the first round, she is 6-2. That same Frazier
is benefiting from the hardcourts in California as opposed to
Wimbledon's grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``My game's pretty one dimensional, so there's not really much I
can change with it,'' Frazier said. ``I go out and hit my ground
strokes, and hopefully, they go in.''
</P>
<P>
   They went in Monday, helping the Michigan resident remain more
composed than her opponent. Tauziat questioned calls several times
and twice slammed her racket on the ground. The Frenchwoman finally
appeared to collect herself when she took a 2-0 lead in the third
set, but Frazier then rattled off six games. Dropping that lead in
the final set, however, might not have done in Tauziat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I lost the match before, in the second set,'' Tauziat
said. ``When you're ahead, you have to go out and take advantage of
it. I had a break point. I didn't get it. And that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Frazier eliminated one of the tournament's eight seeded
players, the victory isn't an enormous upset. The two are 4-4
lifetime and Frazier, ranked 24th by the WTA, holds a 3-2 advantage
on hardcourts.
</P>
<P>
   Tauziat, ranked 10th, rated the way she played with an emphatic
thumbs-down. She did say that Frazier is always a tough opponent,
especially on hardcourts. But when asked if Frazier gave her
trouble, she said, ``No, not really, I think I made the trouble
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier said, ``She made some unforced errors and I got a little
lucky. I just could have easily lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier's victory overshadowed the night match in which Spain's
Conchita Martinez beat Austria's Sylvia Plischke 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez took a 5-0 lead in the first set and controlled the
entire match. Her victory could serve as a confidence booster
because she lost in the first round in tournaments at Stanford and
Carlsbad.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez, who won the Acura Classic in 1995, said she didn't
do anything differently than she did in the first-round losses to
Jennifer Capriati and Barbara Schett. She pointed out that the
tour's talent level has risen over the past years to make every
round a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, you knew you were going to get past the first round,''
Martinez said. ``Now, you never know. There are so many, many good
players.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Other matches: Julie Halard-Decugisof France beat Croatia's
Iva Majoli 6-1, 6-4. Majoli, who is 5-10 this year, was one of
tournament's three wild cards with Stevenson and Corina Morariu.
</P>
<P>
   Ai Sugiyamaof Japan beat Nathalie Dechy of France 6-2, 6-3.
Sugiyama's victory gives third-seeded Mary Piercea rematch in the
second round. Sugiyama beat Pierce in the first round of last
week's TIG Classic in Carlsbad.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying matches were completed Monday as Lisa Raymond, Magui
Serna, Ines Gorrochategui and Anne Kremer earned their way into the
tournament. Serna's match was the closest, as she beat Kimberly Po
6-4, 4-6, 6-4.

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATLANTA _ Forget about looking at the standings today.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the expressions on the faces in the Astros' clubhouse
after Monday night's game at Turner Field. Look at the way the
Astros walked around, stunned and amazed at the uncharacteristic,
un-Astros effort they had just given.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the Mets, Reds and Diamondbacks. Instead, think
about the way things have been in the National League for the past
decade and how they will continue to be until someone proves
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Braves, and then it's everyone else. Monday night, the
Astros looked like just another everyone-else kind of wannabe.
</P>
<P>
   The usually unwavering and unshakable Astros wavered. They shook
in critical situations. They quaked in game-winning moments and
ultimately coughed up a very winnable game 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw a lot of things you don't characteristically see from
us,'' Astros second baseman Craig Biggio said.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the Braves looking vulnerable and beatable this
season. Forget about the Astros looking practically unbeatable in
spite of so many injuries and setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   This was a night that clearly proved yet again that if you want
to take over the National League, you have to prove it against
Atlanta. The Astros didn't.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, this was a night when the Astros not only didn't
take a bold step forward against the Braves but might have taken a
step backward.
</P>
<P>
   The game began the way Atlanta's night air felt _ sultry and
hot. Both teams came dead-serious set on proving something. The
atmosphere dripped with sweat, tension and critical plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scraped out an early lead as the legend of Carl
Everett only grew. Everett went 3-for-4 and now has hits in 12 of
his last 17 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves quickly responded with a game-tying run on the heels
of maybe the greatest play the league will see this season. On a
long drive to the center-field wall by Bill Spiers in the third
inning, the Braves' Andruw Jones sprinted back full speed, leaped
into the air, planted both feet into the padding and caught the
drive over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best play I've ever seen,'' Spiers said.
</P>
<P>
   It was indeed a say-hey kind of play that set the tone for what
would be an entertaining yet ultimately strange night.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, this was the kind of game you wish you could box
up, stow away and open again in October when the nights are cooler
and the stakes are higher. Clearly, both teams wanted to prove
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not by any stretch are we intimidated by them,'' Spiers said.
</P>
<P>
   There were other highlight-reel plays. Biggio turned in a nice
one, and Russ Johnson had a sparkling effort at third base for the
Astros on a high hopper by Jose Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   There were missed opportunities on both sides and situational
pitching moves. There were pivotal moments and controversial calls
_ none more enthralling than the umpiring crew's reversing a home
run down the line by Braves rookie Pascual Matos, calling the ball
foul.
</P>
<P>
   And there was good pitching. Braves starter John Smoltz held the
Astros to two runs for seven innings, but pity Astros starter Chris
Holt. Holt carried a lead into the seventh and pitched well enough
to win most games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just hung a couple of pitches,'' Astros manager Larry
Dierker said, ``and that cost him.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't most games. This was the Braves showing why they are
the team of the '90s and the Astros showing some cracks in the
machine they haven't shown all year.
</P>
<P>
   After fumbling a pair of hit-and-run signals earlier in the game
_ one likely costing an Astros run _ Astros shortstop Tim Bogar
apparently missed a steal signal from the bench. It was the eighth
inning with two outs and the game tied at three, prompting Dierker
to send reliever Doug Henry to the plate instead of pinch-hitting
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was baffled,'' Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said he made the unorthodox move thinking Bogar would
steal. If the steal was successful, Dierker would have pinch-hit
for Henry.
</P>
<P>
   But Bogar never ran, and the Astros never again had a chance in
this one. Afterward, Dierker couldn't believe all the missed signs,
saying his son's Little League team took signs better than the
'Stros.
</P>
<P>
   There was a noticeable tension in the air throughout the Astros'
clubhouse afterward and more than a little finger-pointing. Maybe
it will all be better today, when the three-game set against the
team of the '90s continues. But this was one the Astros could have
had and likely should have had. Instead, the Braves motored along,
and the Astros fumbled and bickered.

thumbs-down. She did say that Frazier is always a tough opponent,
especially on hardcourts. But when asked if Frazier gave her
trouble, she said, ``No, not really, I think I made the trouble
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier said, ``She made some unforced errors and I got a little
lucky. I just could have easily lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier's victory overshadowed the night match in which Spain's
Conchita Martinez beat Austria's Sylvia Plischke 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez took a 5-0 lead in the first set and controlled the
entire match. Her victory could serve as a confidence booster
because she lost in the first round in tournaments at Stanford and
Carlsbad.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez, who won the Acura Classic in 1995, said she didn't
do anything differently than she did in the first-round losses to
Jennifer Capriati and Barbara Schett. She pointed out that the
tour's talent level has risen over the past years to make every
round a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, you knew you were going to get past the first round,''
Martinez said. ``Now, you never know. There are so many, many good
players.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Other matches: Julie Halard-Decugisof France beat Croatia's
Iva Majoli 6-1, 6-4. Majoli, who is 5-10 this year, was one of
tournament's three wild cards with Stevenson and Corina Morariu.
</P>
<P>
   Ai Sugiyamaof Japan beat Nathalie Dechy of France 6-2, 6-3.
Sugiyama's victory gives third-seeded Mary Piercea rematch in the
second round. Sugiyama beat Pierce in the first round of last
week's TIG Classic in Carlsbad.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying matches were completed Monday as Lisa Raymond, Magui
Serna, Ines Gorrochategui and Anne Kremer earned their way into the
tournament. Serna's match was the closest, as she beat Kimberly Po
6-4, 4-6, 6-4.

INDIANS SHUT OUT ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ If this were an audition, Ken Hill's
performance was a success.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels pitcher could still be traded, and the
Cleveland Indians might be interested, especially after placing
starter Jaret Wright on the disabled list Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, however, didn't need any help Monday, as Bartolo
Colon shut out the Angels on seven hits in the Indians' 4-0 win
before 22,013 at Edison Field. The loss was the Angels' fourth in a
row and dropped them a season-worst 19 games under .500 (46-65).
They are 5-20 since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians pursued Angels pitcher Chuck Finley before the
trading deadline but felt the Angels asked too much. But now with
Wright joining Dwight Gooden on the disabled list, the Indians have
Colon, Dave Burba, Charles Nagy and Mark Langston as their
starters. No one else on their roster has started a game this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Hill would have to clear waivers, but he is under contract for
$5.6 million next year and has had elbow problems the past two
seasons, which should be enough to deter teams from making a claim.
</P>
<P>
   Hill was traded from the Cardinals to the Indians just before
the trading deadline in 1995 and went 4-1 in 11 starts down the
stretch, helping the Indians reach the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Monday he allowed three runs (two earned) and eight hits in six
innings. And if there was any question about his elbow, he made 122
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the Indians to two earned runs in six innings is no
small feat, considering the Indians offense ranks No. 1 in the
American League in 10 categories, including batting average, runs,
hits, slugging percentage and on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   He has pitched well in five starts since returning from the
disabled list July 19, even if he has only one win to show for it.
His ERA in those five games is 2.70 and he has allowed 31 hits in
30 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, though, he did get considerable help from his defense,
which threw out two runners at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Jesse Levis tried to score from first on
Omar Vizquel's double to the gap in right-center. Right fielder Tim
Salmon threw to shortstop Gary DiSarcina, whose relay throw on one
hop to catcher Ben Molina nailed Levis.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth inning, Manny Ramirez tried to score from first on
Jim Thome's double to right-center. That relay went center fielder
Jim Edmonds to second baseman Trent Durrington to Molina for the
out.
</P>
<P>
   Molina also threw out one of two baserunners who tried to steal
on him.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians got on the scoreboard early, scoring a run in the
first after leadoff hitter Dave Roberts opened the game with a
single. Roberts stole second, took third on a groundout by Vizquel
and scored on a sacrifice fly by Roberto Alomar.

L.A. DROPS NFL BALL AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, chalk up another stirring debacle perpetuated by the
Coliseum, the Los Angeles Clippers of football stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   As the Cleveland Browns made their re-entrance into the NFL
Monday evening, Los Angeles finds itself once again facing another
autumn in which it must turn to two local universities, USC and
UCLA, for its only football entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   This is a most implausible development, considering L.A. County
happens to be the largest in America and considering as recently as
1993 that this area possessed two NFL franchises.
</P>
<P>
   So how could such a strange scenario unfold?
</P>
<P>
   Blame the Coliseum, or at least those myopic L.A. politicians
who have hitched their NFL hopes on the Coliseum even though (a) it
is a decrepit structure built in 1923 that isn't faintly up to
modern standards, (b) it necessitates massive renovations that
neither the public nor the NFL is willing to subsidize, (c) it
inspires widespread disdain among all NFL owners and (d) it has an
ugly recent history of being spurned by such suitors as the Rams,
Raiders and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   It is now indisputable that the L.A. politicians' obsession with
the Coliseum has prevented the return of pro football to Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Peter O'Malley,
was set to build a football stadium at Chavez Ravine a couple of
years ago, but caved in to pressure applied by L.A. politicians and
meekly scuttled his plan.
</P>
<P>
   You might recall in the mid 1980s when Al Davis, whose Raiders
were playing at the Coliseum in those days, had a stadium deal set
in Irwindale, but it, too, was sabotaged by the L.A. politicians
carrying the Coliseum's banner.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as though five years ago that Hollywood Park also
might build a stadium, but the L.A. politicians pleaded the
Coliseum's case with such passion that those administrating
Hollywood Park reluctantly backed off and reverted to concentrating
only on horse racing and card playing.
</P>
<P>
   And, amid the blaring of trumpets, Michael Ovitz recently
claimed to have an edifice called the Hacienda set to be erected in
Carson. But he also couldn't resist the stern blandishments of the
L.A. politicians, coldly abandoning Carson and going over to the
Coliseum's side.
</P>
<P>
   And so, what are we in L.A. left with because Richard Riordan,
Mark Ridley-Thomas and those other visionary L.A. politicians
stubbornly insist on the Coliseum being the only outlet for pro
football in Southern California?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly startling that such a phenomenon has occurred
since the Coliseum's bureaucratic overseer, the Coliseum
Commission, has a long and ignoble history of gross mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   It was this august body in the mid 1960s that got into a beef
with Jack Kent Cooke, then owner of the Lakers and Kings, and dared
him to find a new place for his teams.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Cooke did building the Forum in Inglewood and L.A.
found itself stuck having to meet the bond payments on a facility,
the Sports Arena, that has become a financial liability ever since.
</P>
<P>
   You might recall that the Coliseum Commission also had some
run-ins in the late 1970s with Carroll Rosenbloom, the upshot of
which inspired Rosenbloom to shift his Rams to Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders still probably would be playing at the Coliseum had
the Coliseum Commission fulfilled its promise to Al Davis to build
luxury suites, which it failed to do even though it had picked up
$20 million from being co-plaintiffs with the Raiders in the
successful anti-trust suit against the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Why is L.A. so obsessed with going with an entity that keeps
producing flops?
</P>
<P>
   What is it about the Coliseum that has the L.A. politicians so
entranced at a time when new football stadiums have been sprouting
up all over the country?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Coliseum has a sacred heritage, having hosted two
Olympic Games and countless other memorable sporting events across
the decades.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line is that it has become an antiquated hovel
compared to its contemporaries, and its price tag for renovation is
simply too steep to lure private entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   And since L.A. won't commit to public money and shouldn't for
the Coliseum, the old stadium has become a burdensome eyesore
creating nothing but frustrations and disappointments for its
advocates, unable to generate the fiscal requisites that the NFL
demands for an expansion franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is too economically shrewd to undercut its newest lodge
member the Browns' Al Lerner turned over $500 million to the league
in expansion franchise fees and in the process diminish the value
of its teams by allowing L.A. into its loving bosom at a cheaper
price.
</P>
<P>
   No way that's going to happen, and that's the reason Houston,
which supposedly has the money in place, is now favored to be the
next city to have an NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it's ludicrous that those who want to bring
football back to L.A. ever would have consented to join forces with
the Coliseum and its fierce proponent, Mark Ridley-Thomas, a city
councilman with mayoral ambitions who understandably would like the
NFL back in a stadium that, by the sheerest coincidence, just
happens to be located in his district.
</P>
<P>
   But even more ludicrous is how those in L.A. boast about how
it's shameful that this country's ``sports capital'' doesn't have
an NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. a sports capital?
</P>
<P>
   A city earns such a title if two or three of its teams are
fortunate enough to win championships in the same year a quirk that
doesn't happen often and such an appellation is pure blaspheme when
applied to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   We have become an area in which our athletic teams in recent
vintage have set new standards of futility in getting blown out in
the NBA playoffs and yielding points in the Rose Bowl and getting
embarrassed in the Sun Bowl and losing game after game by large
margins in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. can boast all it wants about its matchless weather and its
renowned amusements parks and its movie-making capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   But it should affect a modest pose when it discusses athletics
because the unvarnished truth is that it has an antiquated downtown
football stadium whose greatest claim to fame these days is its
ability to keep pro football out of L.A.

 SAME OLD JON: SUCCESS HASN'T GONE TO KITNA's HEAD  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CALRE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY _ To get a glimpse of the real Jon Kitna, it helps to
watch him interact with his 22-month-old son, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna smiles approvingly as Jordan needs next to no coaxing
before raising his arm and mimicking, ``Touchdown, Seahawks.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna breaks into one of those proud-papa grins as Jordan
exchanges high-fives with Pete Kendall and then sends the
massive-by-comparison guard on his way to the locker room with a
``Later.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna almost comes unglued with laughter as Jordan matches tight
end Deems May's gnarled expressions in an impromptu battle of
facial contortions.
</P>
<P>
   He may be the Seahawks' starting quarterback _ just the latest
chapter in an almost-beyond-belief turn of events that have
transpired since he entered Central Washington University as an
afterthought of a passer seven years ago _ but Jon Kitna is first
and foremost just a guy.
</P>
<P>
   Not just any guy, but just a guy nonetheless. A nice guy. A
husband and father. A son. A brother. A Christian. A natural
leader. A quarterback with a linebacker's mentality. A player who
has grown on the team's new coaching staff, just as he did the
team's former coaching staff. A player and person you find yourself
pulling for.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing fancy, but definitely something special. That's Jon
Kitna.
</P>
<P>
   So how is it that someone can come from as far back in the pack
as Kitna has and not emerge with an inflated ego?
</P>
<P>
   ``As my wife always says, she married a math teacher and ended
up with a football player,'' Kitna said during a break in the
team's training camp at Eastern Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna's wife, Jennifer, tells this story about going to her
10-year high school reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``People where like, `Oh, you married a football player. You
really scored,'' she said. ``I'm like, `Not really.' We both still
call ourselves teachers. That's where we want to get to,
eventually. We still kind of look at this as a little vacation.
Then we'll get back to the real world, eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Kitna is able to enjoy this vacation without all the
baggage that can come with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about one of the most salt-of-the-earth people
I've ever met,'' said Todd Peterson, the Seahawks kicker and one of
Kitna's closest friends on the team. ``He treats everybody the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't think of himself more highly than he ought to,
because he does receive some acclaim. Jon has remained
level-headed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the tapestry that is this team, Kitna is the common thread.
He gets along as well with the defensive backs as he does with the
wide receivers. He has earned the respect of the defensive linemen
as well as the offensive linemen. He has the ability to transcend
skin color, social backgrounds and cliques.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon is without a doubt the most transparent person I have ever
met,'' Peterson said. ``By that, I mean he is able to look through
everything else and see someone's heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than terms like arrogant, attitude and aloof, people use
words like humble, humility and grounded to describe Kitna.
</P>
<P>
   Humility? Like Kitna, fullback Mack Strong entered the league as
an undrafted free agent. Like Kitna, he has always had to work for
everything he has gotten. Like Kitna, he is a man with strong
religious beliefs. Maybe that's why Kitna and Strong have become
friends. Strong also offers a clue as to why Kitna has not been
allowed to develop anything close to an attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon hasn't changed a bit since the day he first walked into
the locker room as a rookie,'' Strong said. ``He's still losing to
me playing cards, just like he was as a rookie.''
</P>
<P>
   Humble? Jennifer was, well, less than impressed with her husband
the first time they met.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I wasn't attracted to him at all,'' she
said. ``He had the skinniest neck I had ever seen and this skinny
little waist. Everything about him kind of reminded me of Fire
Marshall Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   They finally clicked, or as Jennifer puts it, Jon finally
convinced her he was worth taking a chance on. She put Jon through
school his final two years of college, when they lived on the
$1,200 a month she was making teaching school.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of stuff, yeah, it does keep us humble,'' Jon said.
</P>
<P>
   Priorities? Football might be the most time-consuming element of
Kitna's life, especially during training camp. But he does not
allow it to become all consuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to Jordan on the phone and he says, `Dada, miss you,
love you,' '' Kitna said, a smile washing across his face. ``It
keeps things in perspective for me. It helps me understand that no
matter how things go on the football field ... my son is still my
son and my wife is still my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Grounded? Jon and Jennifer live within their means. He might be
a starting NFL quarterback, but he is scheduled to make just
$325,000 this season.
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing by NFL standards, but it's a lot more than either
of their parents ever made. They live in a modest house and live
modest lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to live so that if we are both teaching someday, we'll
still be able to live the same way,'' Jennifer said. ``That's how
we want it. That's how our families were. That's how Jon and I grew
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna, as everyone knows by now, grew up in Tacoma and played at
Lincoln High School. He quarterbacked Central Washington to the
NAIA national co-championship as a senior and the Barcelona Dragons
to the World League title in 1997. In three NFL seasons, he has
started six games.
</P>
<P>
   To find the back door to NFL stardom, just follow Kitna.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, at the end of my freshman year, this is where I
expected to be,'' he said. ``I felt like this is where I could
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is here, Kitna won't allow himself to forget what
got him here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody looks at me and says, `Oh, you're a starting
quarterback in the NFL,' like it's an esteemed position,'' Kitna
said. ``But, esteemed in whose eyes?''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get Kitna wrong. He has goals and aspirations, and lofty
ones at that _ especially for someone who entered the league as an
undrafted rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a starting quarterback. I want to be the best
quarterback there ever was,'' he said. ``But at the same time, I
just want to go out and play football just like I always have.
There wasn't all this fanfare when I was at Central and in high
school. I'm just playing a game I love to play. I just try to keep
that mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   As Peterson puts it, ``Regardless of what happens to Jon,
whether he's MVP of a Super Bowl or the league or throws for 4,000
yards in a season, he'll never change. He's the kid from Tacoma.''

OLD `MAD MAX' WON'T STEM SONICS' FREEFALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ain't free agency great?
</P>
<P>
   And don't the Sonics really seem to know how to play the game?
</P>
<P>
   I mean, the Sonics make a big fuss about clearing salary cap
room so they can go sign an impact player and lo and behold,
there's no impact player to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Richmond? No-can-do.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Ceballos? Word in Sacramento Monday was that the Kings
have the inside track _ as if they need more ammo.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Hardaway? The Sonics took the first deal they could get
with Orlando when they got Horace Grant for a slew of Sonics
castaways on a draft-day deal.
</P>
<P>
   Guess Sonics president Wally Walker did not think the Magic were
in such a charitable mood to basically give away Penny.
</P>
<P>
   But if it's true that Suns owner Jerry Colangelo sealed the deal
to steal Hardaway by presenting him with purple-velvet covered golf
clubs, certainly Walker and Paul Westphal could have made a trip to
Puetz or Nevada Bob's to wow Penny to Seattle, no?
</P>
<P>
   You gotta love this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably going to sign two more guys this week, they
just won't be household names,'' Walker said Monday after it was
announced that the Sonics' big offseason acquisition is Vernon
Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, Mad Max.
</P>
<P>
   What Walker failed to mention is that the biggest reason
Maxwell's name is a household name is because Maxwell's arrest
sheet is about as long as his NBA career stats.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the fact that Maxwell punched out a Blazers fan back in
1995 or that he served jail time for misdemeanor possession of
marijuana does not concern me, mostly because it doesn't concern
Gary Payton, who wanted Maxwell in a Sonics uniform and there lies
the entire story.
</P>
<P>
   Things are so desperate with the Sonics that Payton and his
agents have all but carte blanche to suggest to Walker the players
the Sonics must go after.
</P>
<P>
   And, frankly, after watching the likes of Craig Ehlo and Moochie
Norris get trotted into Sonics camps, why wouldn't Payton try his
hand at assistant general manager?
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell's arrival is part of Payton's desire to have the Sonics
get tougher, or in Payton's vernacular _ a little more ``ghetto'' _
which is not a bad idea, at least when there has been an absence of
good ideas the past three or four years about who the Sonics should
sign to help win Payton (and oh, yes, owner Barry Ackerley) a ring.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Shawn Kemp was a genuis.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, after the 1996 NBA Finals, when the Sonics battled to
Game 6 against the Bulls, the Sonics' power forward could see which
direction the Sonics were heading and decided to bail.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because when it came time in the summer of '96 to negotiate
those bonanza free-agent deals, Kemp knew that Walker had made a
tremendous mistake signing Jim McIlvaine for that $35 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, the Sonics have been paying for that decision.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, would the Sonics' offseason be reaching near
crisis proportion if the chances of Vin Baker becoming a
championship-caliber player weren't so dicey?
</P>
<P>
   Talk about grasping at straws. The Sonics have no choice but to
re-sign Baker to a whopping $87 million contract and then pray the
big man delivers all he promises _ which is a lot, considering
Baker has yet to demonstrate a championship-caliber caliber inside
game.
</P>
<P>
   But as Payton said, the Sonics didn't trade Kemp to turn around
and lose Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like negotiating from a position of strength.
</P>
<P>
   Walker is over so many barrels, it's a wonder he hasn't booked a
ride over Niagara Falls this summer.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other mistakes that are coming back to haunt the
Sonics, what about the McIlvaine leftovers?
</P>
<P>
   As previously mentioned, it sure looked as if Walker had all but
erased the slate on that disaster back in June when he traded away
Don McLean (among several others) to Orlando for Grant.
</P>
<P>
   But oops, we were wrong about that, it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, clearing off the remaining cap room by dealing
MacLean (the last vestiges of the McIlvaine disaster) and
free-agent bust Billy Owens has netted the Sonics absolutely no
bargaining power.
</P>
<P>
   Walker has been unable to trade Hersey Hawkins, which would have
been necessary to complete a deal with Washington for Richmond. But
again, Hawkins' contract was signed during that summer spending
spree that locked up Payton but also brought in McIlvaine and
alienated Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   There is no other way to spin this. The Sonics are in dissaray.
They have gone from Game 6 of the 1996 NBA Finals to
circle-the-drain desperation faster than the Miss Bud going around
Lake Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Signing Vernon Maxwell is better than nothing, but that isn't
saying very much.
</P>
<P>
   Not when everyone from the Sonics front office down to the bar
stool sitters at Floyds Bar-B-Que in lower Queen Anne understood
that in order for the Sonics to hang with the Suns, Blazers,
Lakers, Spurs, Jazz, Kings, Rockets and Timberwolves, they were
going to have to do a whole lot better than nothing.

YANKEES DEFEAT A'S, 12-8 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Before each at-bat, Bernie Williams steps
across the batter's box and practices his geometry: he lays his bat
across the front of the plate, notes the spot where the handle dots
the ground and, from that point, draws a straight line back toward
the umpire. In this way, he knows where to take his stance.
</P>
<P>
   Williams seems to do this subconsciously with the calendar, as
well. When summer creeps toward fall, a line is drawn and Williams
begins to whale the ball. He launched a grand slam on Monday night
in an eight-run second inning, and the Yankees whipped Oakland,
12-8.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, Derek Jeter and Ricky Ledee also hit home runs
for the Yankees in a game affected by the small and consistent
strike zone being called by John Shulock, the home-plate umpire.
Oakland's pitchers walked nine batters, the Yankees' six.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics (60-52) are in the thick of the race for a
post-season berth, having won 9 of their first 10 games on this
homestand. But the Yankees (69-42) issued a reminder of who is atop
the American League, jumping on Oakland early.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Haynes walked the first two batters in the second inning,
Williams and Tino Martinez, and then Chili Davis laced a
run-scoring double. Ledee singled, Scott Brosius later singled, and
Knoblauch drew a walk; with the Yankees ahead, 3-0, Mike Oquist
replaced Haynes.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeter drew a walk, forcing home a fourth run. Paul O'Neill
flied to short left, bringing Williams to the plate, to draw his
line and set his stance. Going into Monday night's game, Williams
had 16 hits in 30 at-bats with runners in scoring position (.533).
</P>
<P>
   He fell behind no balls and two strikes and fouled off two
pitches. He took a ball, and then another, and with a 2-2 count,
Williams took a pitch low, threw his bat down and began jogging to
first. With the crowd laughing and jeering at Williams for his
mistake, he returned to the plate, picked up his bat _ and bashed
the next pitch into the stands, for his 19th home run.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also has 82 runs batted in over all, moving ahead of
Jeter (80) for the team lead. Thirty of those rbi have come in the
25 games since the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' eight-run outburst was reminiscent of their
memorable game here last Aug. 4, when Darryl Strawberry's grand
slam highlighted an eight-run rally in the ninth inning of a 10-5
victory.
</P>
<P>
   But this victory would not be so noteworthy, and the Yankees
struggled to hold their lead as Hideki Irabu was knocked out early.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu has managed to contain the flashes of temper that were his
signature in 1997, those spats with the umpires that left him
kicking angrily at the pitching rubber. Close calls that go against
Irabu do not bother him as much now, the pitching coach Mel
Stottlemyre said the other day; he usually contains his
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday night, Shulock called a strike zone roughly
equivalent to the size of a laptop computer, a strike zone that
often eluded and perturbed Irabu. He came into this game with the
second-best ratio of strikeouts to walks in the American League
(3.96), but on Monday night he walked three and struck out none and
repeatedly fell behind in the count.
</P>
<P>
   He reached a 2-0 count to five consecutive batters in one
stretch, and Irabu appeared to be quite certain that some of his
pitches were strikes, contrary to Shulock's opinion. With the
Yankees ahead, 8-0, Irabu gave up four runs with two outs in the
second inning, including a two-run home run to Tony Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   After throwing a close pitch for a ball to the next batter,
Randy Velarde, Irabu glared at Shulock and twice spread his arms:
What do I have to do to throw a strike, his body language screamed.
Martinez and then Stottlemyre went to the mound and tried to calm
Irabu. The next inning, he fell behind, 2-0, to Scott Spiezio and
walked slowly behind the mound with a ``you've got to be kidding''
grin _ and fired a fastball, which Spiezio belted for a home run.
</P>
<P>
   By the fourth, Irabu appeared resigned to firing fastballs in
frustration, and with the Yankees' lead reduced to 10-6 after four
innings, Manager Joe Torre elected to replace Irabu with Allen
Watson rather than give Irabu a chance to register three more outs
and his 10th victory. Irabu's outing was his shortest since May19.
</P>
<P>
   But Watson walked two of the first three batters he faced, and
after Eric Chavez singled home a run, Ramiro Mendoza relieved,
perhaps the best possible match for Shulock's tiny strike zone.
Mendoza, with outstanding control, got out of the jam and pitched
two and two-thirds innings to run his record to 5-7.

SONICS GET MORE ORNERY BY ADDING GUARD MAXELL  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It would appear the Sonics are stuck on one chore from
their summer to-do list.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, they keep getting tougher and tougher.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of veteran guard Vernon Maxwell Monday virtually
assured the Sonics will be a bit more ornery than last season.
Maxwell, a daring player throughout his 11-year career, signed a
three-year contract believed to be worth roughly $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vernon is the kind of guy we want to set the defensive tone.
We didn't want to lose out on him,'' Sonics president Wally Walker
said. ``We've talked to him all along the free agent process. Based
on playing against him last year, he's always on the floor at the
end of games. Plus, he's always taking big shots and making a lot
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell, 33, is labeled ``Mad Max'' for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot-4, Maxwell is a fearless competitor who is quick
enough to play both guard positions. He is known for never biting
his tongue, and does not back down from any challenge _ whether it
be a bigger opponent or crazy shot attempt.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a player with the same attitude as fiery Sonics
point guard Gary Payton, it's Maxwell, who becomes the second new
player on the team's roster.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics acquired hard-nosed forward Horace Grant on draft day
to bolster their front line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very intimidating to see me and Gary in the
backcourt. Everybody knows it,'' said Maxwell, who also considers
Grant a close friend. ``... I know we run our mouth the same, and
we play with the same aggressiveness on defense and offense.''
Maxwell averaged 10.7 points, 1.7 assists and 21.9 minutes in 46
games off the bench for the Sacramento Kings last season. He also
shot a career-high 35 percent from 3-point range. A concern would
be whether Maxwell can play more minutes and stay injury-free in an
82-game season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics probably will play Maxwell mostly alongside Payton,
which would mean a decreased role for Hersey Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have a significant role,'' Walker said of
Maxwell. ``I can't say it means anything for Hawk. It just means
we've bolstered our backcourt.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell sought a three-year $10 million contract from the Kings,
who renounced their rights to him. The Sonics' original offer was a
two-year deal worth $3.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Giving Maxwell a third year _ which he can opt out of _ cinched
the deal. Maxwell turned down Detroit, Toronto and the L.A.
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really wasn't a hard decision because I felt like I had a
better chance to have a good year with established ballplayers,''
Maxwell said. ``I felt like I had a better chance of getting back
to that next level. ... And I wanted some stability. The money is
not that bad. It's not what I expected, but I'll bite the bullet.
It weighs out and it's going to make me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell resurrected his career in Sacramento after a tumultuous
career.
</P>
<P>
   He was a 1988 second-round pick of the Denver Nuggets. But
Maxwell is best known for his title runs with the 1994 and 1995 NBA
champion Houston Rockets. From 1995 through 1998, Maxwell played
for Philadelphia, San Antonio, Orlando and Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   After signing Maxwell, the Sonics remained close to $1.8 million
under the salary cap. Walker said he expects to sign another player
or complete a trade this week.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins is still on the trading block. Unless the Sonics do a
sign-and-trade, they will compete with most teams that can offer
their $2 million exception to free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Walker called a sign-and-trade deal with Washington to get Mitch
Richmond, ``an extreme long shot.'' However, Walker is working on
another sign-and-trade transaction that would land a big-name small
forward.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics still need a center and an athletic player who can
create shots off the dribble. Walker is turning his attention to
small forwards _ possibly Cedric Ceballos (Dallas) or Cedric
Henderson (Cleveland).
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to sign a young slashing guy,'' Walker said. ``We'll
look at some veteran guys. We're looking for guys we think will
benefit from the proposed (defensive) rules changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Maxwell stayed out of trouble in Sacramento last
season, the Sonics latched on to a guy known for playing by his own
rules off the court.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Maxwell was suspended after going into the stands at
Portland and attacked a heckler whom he claimed was making fun of
his stillborn child. During the 1995 playoffs, Maxwell was
suspended by the Rockets after a disagreement with the coaching
staff. He played just one postseason game and was waived that June.
</P>
<P>
   He has been jailed for a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge
and violating his probation for a previous gun arrest. Maxwell also
filed for bankruptcy after he was sued in 1996 for allegedly
knowingly giving a woman herpes during a brief relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done anything in five years. The past is the past.
I've moved ahead,'' Maxwell said. ``I did everything that was said
and written about me. But judge me after meeting me. Don't judge me
for my past.''

SPARKS FAIL TO IGNITE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Sparks have experienced slow
starts throughout the season but never worse than Monday's critical
home game against the Detroit Shock.
</P>
<P>
   They fell behind by 20 points in the first half, and despite a
brief but spirited second-half surge, never recovered from the
early deficit. The Shock held them to their lowest scoring output
since last season, 84-59, before 6,858 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Sparks' first loss at home in seven games, dropping
them to one game ahead of the Sacramento Monarchs, who host them in
Sacramento tonight. The Sparks are second in the Western Conference
at 17-8; the Monarchs, who were idle Monday, are 17-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like trying to start your car in the middle of a
Chicago winter,'' Sparks coach Orlando Woolridge said about the
slow start. ``We just couldn't get started.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to regroup and get ready for tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, which had lost three of its last four games since
trading Cindy Brown and Korie Hlede for Utah's Wendy Palmer and
Olympia Scott-Richardson, finally got the game they were looking
for from the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, who was a reserve for Utah, is a starter for the Shock
and played like one with 15 points and 12 rebounds in just 26
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was the worst game for Sparks center Lisa Leslie since the
All-Star game. The All-Star MVP was 2 for 11 from the field and had
only four rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks, who trailed 42-26 at the half, trimmed the deficit
to nine points (51-42) with a 9-0 run led by La'Kiesha Frett (12
points) and DeLisha Milton (16 points, eight rebounds).
</P>
<P>
   But the Shock, who are 12-14 and third in the Eastern
Conference, outscored the Sparks 19-8 to finish the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting for our playoff lives and everybody stepped
up,'' Detroit coach Nancy Lieberman-Cline said.

BIG SWING BY BUHNER RAISES SPIRIT, SINKS WHITE SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When he dropped a popup in the third inning Monday
night, Jay Buhner thought back to the 1995 playoffs in Cleveland,
when he misjudged a fly bll but ended up the hero when he won the
game with a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's misplay was embarrassing _ ``I just flat clanked it,''
he said _ but Buhner simply picked up the ball and threw to second
for a force out. This would be one of the good nights, with Buhner
the good guy again.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner's first grand slam in more than three years sent the
Mariners to a 6-4 victory over the Chicago White Sox at Safeco
Field. It was a two-way starring role for the veteran right
fielder, who bloodied his left forearm when he dove to catch Frank
Thomas' foul fly for the second out of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game, it does wonders,'' Buhner said. ``I just love the
way one minute you feel like you're a goat and the next minute you
can be a hero. I'm just fortunate to have an opportunity where I'm
in the lineup every day and I'm able to go out there and redeem
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Since July 15, when Buhner came back after nearly two months on
the disabled list because of a strained hamstring, the Mariners
have lost ground in the standings and Buhner has struggled to find
his timing. When he came to bat in the sixth inning Monday, he was
hitting .196 with three homers and four RBIs in 21 games since
returning.
</P>
<P>
   But in the sixth, the Mariners loaded the bases on a walk by Ken
Griffey Jr. and infield singles by Alex Rodriguez and Edgar
Martinez. Buhner took four of John Snyder's pitches, three of which
were close but only one called a strike, then tore into a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   He slowed into a trot just a step or two out of the batter's
box. This was a 411-foot rocket that not even Safeco could fizzle.
``I knew (BEGIN ITAL) that (END ITAL) one was out,'' Buhner said.
</P>
<P>
   It was something to savor, not only because it gave the M's a
6-3 lead but because it put Buhner at peace with himself. After the
game, he brought up Saturday's 1-0 loss to the Yankees, when he
doubled twice but failed in a crucial bases-loaded situation.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night was redemtion for that, and for the last several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was starting to get a little perturbed at myself at the way
things were going, and I had a lot of negative things going through
my head, a lot of things that have been stressing me out over the
last couple of weeks since I've come back,'' Buhner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to go out and be able to do that. Just when you
think you're down in the dumps, one little swing of the bat can
totally change it. I went up there my next at-bat and felt like I
was completely locked in. Maybe that can be the one at-bat that
gets things going.''
</P>
<P>
   The M's won for the first time since last Tuesday, snapping a
five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   They scored their first two runs in the first inning, when
Martinez doubled off the wall in left-center, scoring John Mabry
and Rodriguez, who had singled.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lead, M's starter Gil Meche promptly gave it away.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old right-hander retired the first White Sox batter
he faced, then walked Paul Konerko. The next batter, Greg Norton,
golfed Meche's only changeup of the game deep into the right-field
seats.
</P>
<P>
   A four-pitch walk came next, then a visit from pitching coach
Stan Williams followed by another four-pitch walk. The bullpen was
stirring, and with good reason: Meche lasted only 12/3 innings in
his previous start, and it seemed he might end another at the same
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never walked two batters in a row on eight pitches in my
life,'' Meche said. ``It's a tough situation to get through.
There's so many things running through your mind out there. The
first thing that comes up is, I don't want to get taken out of this
game, so I've got to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   He dueled Ray Durham on a tough at-bat, finally retiring the
second baseman on a fly to center. The White Sox took a 3-2 lead
before the first out of the third, but Meche allowed no more hits
after Frank Thomas' RBI single. He improved to 3-2 but was
unsatisifed with the six-inning performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wild for sure,'' Meche said. ``I wasn't walking as many
guys the last four innings, but those guys were missing some
pitches that were mistakes. I got away with a lot of bad pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   After two innings from Jose Paniagua, the M's survived in the
ninth after Jose Mesa allowed a leadoff single and a four-pitch
walk. Chris Singleton popped up a bunt attempt, then Buhner put on
his cape to rob Thomas. One out later, the ovations of the 42,978
fans were loudest for Buhner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the favorites here, no question,'' manager Lou
Piniella said. ``And tonight, he responded.''

   APPAREL FIRMS SETTLE LAWSUIT OVER SAIPAN SWEATSHOPSBy ROBERT 
 COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Four large apparel corporations settled out of court Monday in
a landmark class-action lawsuit aimed at ending sweatshop labor
conditions on the U.S. island territory of Saipan. Four other firms
signed a preliminary agreement stating their willingness to do the
same.
<P>
   Together, the concessions mark the first step by American
companies to address a growing controversy over accusations of
illegal labor abuses on Saipan, which has become a major site for
clothes manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Three class-action lawsuits filed in January sought $1 billion
in damages, describing the Saipan factories as ``America's worst
sweatshop,'' where 50,000 indentured laborers from China, the
Philippines and Bangladesh _ mostly young women _ have been
mistreated and cheated of wages.
</P>
<P>
   Under settlements filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles,
Nordstrom, J. Crew, Cutter &AMP; Buck and Gymboree agreed to pay $1.25
million to reimburse workers for the ``recruitment fees'' that they
were charged in exchange for being hired. The money also will set
up a program of independent monitoring of factories operated by the
companies' contractors on the island.
</P>
<P>
   The fees _ which are charged by labor recruiters and average
$5,000 _ will be banned under the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Four firms that were about to be included in the lawsuits _ Polo
Ralph Lauren, Phillips-Van Heusen, Donna Karan and Chadwick's of
Boston _ signed an agreement in principle to join Monday's
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen other firms named in the suits, including Gap, Tommy
Hilfiger, Sears and J.C. Penney, did not take part in the
settlement and remain defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Saipan is one of the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S.
commonwealth in the western Pacific that is exempt from American
labor, immigration and customs laws. As a result of these
exemptions, Saipan's billion-dollar-per-year garment industry is
allowed to stamp its clothing with ``Made in the USA'' tags.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Congress, led by Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.,
charge that the exemptions allow violations of international human
rights on U.S. soil. But reform legislation has been repeatedly
blocked by House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who praises
Saipan as a success story of free-market capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits were filed on behalf of the Saipan workers by the
Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees and by
three nonprofit groups: Global Exchange and Asian Law Caucus of San
Francisco, and Sweatshop Watch of Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the lawsuits say the monitoring program, which will
be carried out by Verite, a nonprofit group based in Amherst,
Mass., will set a precedent because it will make unannounced visits
to factories and will carry out private interviews with workers in
their own languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement establishes a monitoring program with teeth,''
said Lora Jo Foo, president of Sweatshop Watch. ``It will make an
important difference in the lives of thousands of Saipan garment
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Bad Publicity Behind Move
</P>
<P>
   The companies that settled Monday did not accept liability in
the lawsuits. Company executives indicated that the negative
publicity surrounding the controversy was a big motive for
settling.
</P>
<P>
   ``A long, drawn-out legal battle didn't make good sense to us
even though we remain confident about our ability to successfully
defend ourselves in these lawsuits,'' said Erik Nordstrom,
co-president of Nordstrom. ``We feel these resources are better
spent elsewhere and could be used toward making a good-faith effort
to furthering our commitment to using vendors who comply with the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Gymboree CEO Gary White sought to downplay the importance of the
settlement. ``We have checked and double-checked our own monitoring
of vendors to assure ourselves that our manufacturing partners were
treating workers well. While we are comfortable with the processes
we had in place, we are pleased to support the greater safeguards
embodied in this agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Meyerhoff, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the
settlement will add pressure on Gap, the largest of the 13
remaining defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first domino for Saipan sweatshops,'' he said.
``There's no reason why the others could not agree to the same
terms. They now have a difficult choice _ whether to solve Saipan's
problems or be obstructionist and spend millions upon millions in
litigation.''

   3. KREMLIN GAMBLES ON PUTIN
</P>
<P>
   by Yevgeny Krasnikov - from The Moscow News Although Moscow's
latest Monday massacre - the firing of Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin and the entire Cabinet - was a shock in the West, for
several weeks now in Russia, the media have been citing the name of
Vladimir V. Putin, 46, as a new political favorite. Since Yevgeny
Primakov was abruptly dismissed as prime minister three months ago,
top Kremlin officials have been saying that Stepashin was destined
to become Yeltsin's successor. But Naina Yeltsin, the president's
wife, among others, has been actively trying to persuade Yeltsin to
choose Putin. Yevgeny Krasnikov is political correspondent for
Moscow News.

   4. ARSENIC for DESSERT? By Tamara Zlotnikova from The Moscow
News
</P>
<P>
   In six months, Russia is supposed to begin full-scale
destruction of its chemical weapons, according to the Treaty on the
Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of
Chemical Weapons and Their Destruction. But there is no money in
the treasury to do so. It was claimed that without the treaty,
Russia's international prestige would suffer and economic sanctions
would be slapped on us. If, however, it was ratified, supposedly
the international community would pick up much of the tab for the
destruction of our chemical weapons. That is not happening. Tamara
Zlotnikova is head of the Committee for Ecology in the State Duma
of Russia.

   6. WHO KNOWS BEST ? -- THE EXPERTS OR THE PUBLIC ?
</P>
<P>
   by Timothy Noah from The New York Times Magazine
</P>
<P>
   The general populace is too fickle and too easily manipulated to
decide weighty public questions - that's what Walter Lippmann wrote
in `` Public Opinion, `` his 1922 book, when he was well on his way
to establish himself as journalism's pre-eminent mandarin. These
big questions ought to be handled instead by `` a specialized class
`` of experts working closely with top government officials,
Lippmann wrote. (Full-length article - 3,300 words - available on
request)

<P>
   7. DOWNSIZING THE POPE - WHY IS THIS POPE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER
POPES ?
</P>
<P>
   by Michael McGough from Slate
</P>
<P>
   In the early evening of Oct. 16, 1978, the newly elected Pope
John Paul II appeared on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica and
told the crowd that he had accepted election even though `` I was
afraid in receiving the nomination. `` (Michael McGough is
editorial page editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette)

</P>
<P>
   Of all the triumphs that have marked this as America's century -
breathtaking advances in science and technology, the
democratization of wealth and dispersal of political power in ways
hardly imaginable in 1899 - none is more inspiring, if incomplete,
than our pursuit of racial justice.

 For Immediate Release

<P>
   &UR; It was only 16 months ago that President Clinton toured Africa,
calling it ripe for renaissance. Since then, the number of Africa's
refugees has swollen by more than 5 million, to 8.1 million people.
Contributing heavily to that figure has been the conflict between
Eritrea and Ethiopia, where in three days alone more people died
than in the entire NATO operation in Kosovo. In a two-part series,
written by diplomatic correspondent John Connelly and photographed
by Dominic Chavez, the Globe explores the situation. &LR;

 TSORONA, Eritrea: ... a new nation.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Western diplomat based in Eritrea said expectations of many
African countries should be lowered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a new leadership in Africa who are fundamentally
different than the old leadership. They don't have their hands out
as much as the old did for aid, they're smarter, full of ideas of
where to take their countries,'' the diplomat said. ``But maybe
President Clinton comparing them to Michelangelo was a little far.
There needs to be a real maturation process that these new leaders
go through.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the diplomat said, ``it's not time to give up on the
`New Africa,' but there should be more critical thinking because
the challenges are incredible: epidemiologically, politically, with
nature, and providing food. We should put realistic time frames on
the goals.''
</P>
<P>
   But peace comes first.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, some progress has been made. Shaky peace
deals were struck in Sierra Leone, where, in one week in January,
rebels killed an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 civilians in the capital
of Freetown and sliced off the arms and legs of thousands more; and
in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where 10 countries and rebel
groups have taken the side of the government or the main rebel
faction, drawing in most of central Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, solutions remain elusive. The United States and
United Nations have both largely left it to African countries to
resolve neighborhood conflicts, but few leaders have effectively
filled the void.
</P>
<P>
   In Sudan, rebels just broke off peace negotiations with the
government, prolonging a war that has spanned two decades and
killed 2 million people. War has resumed in Angola, where 1.6
million people are displaced, and the United Nations has responded
by announcing a pullout of its peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   In Angola, combatants are laying new mine fields, after spending
years and tens of millions of dollars to clear them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia and Eritrea are another story. Here, the United States
has played an active role, at least compared to its involvement in
other African conflicts. Late last month, former national security
adviser Anthony Lake made his fourth trip in one year to the
capitals of both nations.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides took a small step toward settling the border issue in
late July, by agreeing in principle to pull back to positions held
prior to May 6, 1998. US officials say this round of diplomacy
represents the best chance for peace, which they hope will result
in the deployment of international peacekeepers and a negotiated
settlement on the border demarcation.
</P>
<P>
   American officials are especially eager to seal an agreement not
only to stop the killing, but also to prevent the conflict from
spreading. Already, Ethiopian troops are battling with Somalia
rebel fighters to the east, but more worrisome is that the
Ethiopian-Eritrean war could exacerbate the threat of famine in
north-central Ethiopia. Some 5 million Ethiopians are at risk, say
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Ending the war won't come easily, say analysts and people on the
front such as Abraham Ghebreab, a Tsarona-area commander for half
of his 39 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice to end this is not ours,'' said Abraham, who
offered visitors a snack of popcorn and coffee in his hillside
lean-to during a late afternoon downpour. ``We are just waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he commands thousands of troops, Abraham bridles at a
suggestion that the front has become his second home. ``It doesn't
feel like home life,'' said Ghebreab, whose wife and three children
live in Asmara. ``I saw them last in January and I wish that
weren't so.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the war bears the attributes of a family feud with
a poisonous past. In the mid-1970s, the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front, led by Isaias, and Ethiopia's Tigray People's
Liberation Front, led by Meles, tried to overlook border and
ideological concerns in joining to overthrow the Menguistu regime
in Ethiopia in 1991. But along the way, they often had political
difficulties, especially when one side began critiquing the other's
vision of a state.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ethiopia's new leader, Meles, granted Eritrea
independence. In 1993, Isaias became president of the new Eritrean
nation, which had endured rule by Italy, Britain, and then Ethiopia
over the past century.
</P>
<P>
   Relations soured not long after Meles and Isaias took power. In
a series of border incidents in mid-1997, Ethiopian troops took a
small village in southwestern Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the skirmishes were kept quiet by both sides.
Unpublicized negotiations failed. The breaking point was reached
almost a year later, in May 1998, when Ethiopian forces killed at
least four Eritrean soldiers in the border town of Badme, a tiny
town that both countries claim.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea responded by sending a mechanized force into the
disputed town. Ethiopia and Western diplomats said that response
prompted the broader conflict. Ethiopia declared war, labeling
Eritrea the aggressor. Eritrea, trying to sway international
opinion, belatedly said that Ethiopia had been the aggressor back
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, the war exploded into the deadly border
battles. If the war continues, analysts expect additional huge
losses of life with the trading of only the tiniest clumps of land
from one army to the other. Eritrea, with only about 3.5 million
people, has sent an estimated 200,000 on or near the front lines,
where they have dug long trenches.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia, a country of 55 million, has sent an estimated 250,000
to 300,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   While both sides have spent tens of millions of dollars on
warplanes, heavy equipment, and small arms, any future fighting
will probably also involve Ethiopia's human wave attacks, which
were first used by the government's ancestors in 1896 to break
through Italian lines in what is now northern Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is war in the family,'' said Salih Booker, an Africa
specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington.
``Both sides misjudged the other side, and they are taking it out
harder on each other than they would anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eritrea-based Western diplomat used less diplomatic
language: ``They blundered into a stupid war over nothing and they
couldn't get out of it because of pigheadedness and history.''
</P>
<P>
   In Asmara, Yemina Gebreab, a senior political adviser to Isaias,
acknowledged in hindsight that the government's decision to keep
quiet Ethiopia's 1997 border incursions ``did hurt Eritrea. We
preferred to solve this problem among ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea's expectation, he said, was that Ethiopia would do the
same in May 1998, when Eritrean forces conducted the offensive.
``Going public was a breach of trust from the Ethiopian side; their
statement is what led to the war. Eritrea was behaving in a
responsible way by not publicizing the problem. You know, you can
publicize a problem and make it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Yemina said he was guardedly optimistic about the prospects of
peace, largely because of the intensified international efforts.
``The United States is very seriously engaged, and for the first
time they are willing to be very forceful in their approach,'' he
said. Diplomats say US envoy Lake has made vague threats of
sanctions if warfare does not cease.
</P>
<P>
   But in Addis Ababa, government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse
expressed doubt on whether Eritrea wanted peace. ``The Eritrean
government has repeatedly worked to thwart and impede the peace
process in the past, and it cannot be expected to have suddenly had
a change of heart and be sincerely committed to peace,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the front line, Eritrean soldiers expressed a keen desire for
a settlement, as long as their Pennsylvania-size country doesn't
give up its land. It wasn't possible to hear the views of Ethiopian
soldiers, as Ethiopia declined to allow the Globe access to its
front line. While Eritrea recently reopened the border areas to
reporters, Ethiopia has allowed only a single group of Addis
Ababa-based journalists to go to the front lines since the war
began, saying the danger is too great.
</P>
<P>
   Now, much of the front is quiet, with the exception of periodic
mortar fire around the hilly Badme region.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides seem reluctant to fight during the rainy season,
which lasts through October, because of the difficulty of moving in
the mud.
</P>
<P>
   At Tsorona, that gives them time to think, about the war and
about that horrible battle in March. And about the graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any human being would feel sad about this situation, living on
a graveyard,'' said Jonas Mahari, 30, of Adikiey, in southern
Eritrea. ``But there's no other place to stay, because we must
defend our country.''
</P>
<P>
   As the rains keep gushing down, there is talk on the front line
about collecting more dirt to put over the exposed bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must rebury them,'' Jonas said. ``We can't live like
this.''

 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ASMARA, Eritrea _ From the American Bar, a sidewalk cafe on
Independence Avenue in this capital of lime-washed stucco and
bougainvillea gardens, the war front with Ethiopia is only 55 miles
away. It could be halfway around the world from the looks of things
on a recent night, as hundreds of people strolled the boulevard and
packed cafes to drink the delicious 25-cent Asmara Beer.
</P>
<P>
   But the bitter taste of war wasn't far. It was on everyone's
lips.
</P>
<P>
   There was talk about work in war factories, where people rebuilt
the tanks and heavy artillery the Ethiopians left behind in 1991,
at the end of a 30-year war. There were conversations about the
impossibility of planning a future with so much unresolved. And
there were those speaking about postwar life, and how Eritrea would
find it difficult to cope with the aftermath of what has become the
world's bloodiest war.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea, population 3.5 million, independent for less than a
decade, a country that is no larger than Pennsylvania, dearly wants
an end to its 15-month war with Ethiopia. For this embattled,
tightly stitched society, which some say bears similarities to the
nascent Israel of the 1950s, war has hurt every family. Peace, too,
is likely to usher in painful change.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the war gets over, there won't be the euphoria that there
was the last time, with independence,'' said Wayne Kessler, a
California native who worked here for the Peace Corps in the 1960s
and returned in 1995 to work on development projects. ``There will
be a sigh of relief, and there will be a taking stock of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Peace, said Kessler as he leaned forward at the American Bar,
could create a new group of leaders. ``The young people, this new
generation of fighters, will want to have more of a say in the
government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as two years ago, no one would have predicted this.
Eritrea was a bright light in the Horn of Africa, a country just
stretching its legs, a tale so inspirational that National
Geographic in 1996 touted Eritrea's infancy.
</P>
<P>
   Now the hope for Eritrea is limited to ending the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   The next few weeks will tell much about the future of the war,
and of the two countries. An Algerian envoy is expected to present
ideas on a cease-fire. Among diplomats, there are high expectations
that peace is close. Among Eritreans and Ethiopians, there is great
skepticism. Distrust reigns.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Associated Press reported that the Eritrean
government accepted the Organization of African Unity's plan for
ending the war, a government statement said. Eritrea pledged ``full
cooperation with the OAU and the United States in implementing the
. . . agreements,'' which include a framework agreement,
procedures, and technical arrangements, the AP reported.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, there is an air of sadness that hangs over
Asmara and throughout Eritrea, which a Western diplomat described
as a ``place so different from the rest of Africa.'' It was
difficult to gauge views from the Ethiopian side, as Ethiopia
declined to allow the Globe access to its front line.
</P>
<P>
   Eritreans, the Western diplomat said, ``were the Spartans of
Africa. Nobody really loves them. They are kind of aggressive, but
kind of puritanical as well. You can see that when you realize that
there's the complete absence of corruption here, that there's very
little crime as well. Eritrea as a nation really means something to
the people here. There's a strong sense of community values.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense is particularly strong during war, prompting Eritreans
of all stripes, for example, to switch greetings from a traditional
handshake to exchanging three taps on the right shoulder. Soldiers
started the salutation because they were carrying their guns and
did not want them to accidentally discharge during a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   About 200,000 people are deployed near the front, the percentage
equivalent of about 16 million Americans. Late last month, men age
41 to 50 were called in for military training. The government has
given no casualty figures, but diplomats and analysts estimate
between 7,000 and 15,000 dead. Ethiopia's casualties, say Western
diplomats, are probably about four times as large, from 30,000 to
60,000 dead.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of common purpose is seen in how the country deals
with those who die during war. No one will express sympathy to the
families of the dead until the war is over. That was what they did
during the 30-year war with Ethiopia, and that is what they will do
now. No one interviewed questioned this. All said it was a matter
of not allowing the mourning to deter the country's purpose; the
country would mourn together later in one giant funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my obligation, not to say anything,'' said Natan
Gebremicael, 20, a medic who suffered shrapnel injuries in a border
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Natan and other soldiers said the battles have been ferocious,
with waves of Ethiopian troops charging at the Eritreans, a World
War I tactic that essentially guaranteed high casualties for a
chance at breaking through trenches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrible actually,'' he said. ``An enemy is coming. You
have to defend. You're killing people, Ethiopians, who are not well
trained. Actually, it was terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he was anxious to get back to the war.
</P>
<P>
   His father, a 57-year-old English teacher, understood. He said
Eritreans must fight for their land as Israelis fought for theirs.
``Whenever the Arabs came to fight, the Israelis didn't hesitate.
They understand a lot about war, and Israel stands strong now. It
will be the same for Eritrea.''
</P>
<P>
   Independence came after more than a century of occupation. The
Italians ruled for a half-century, relinquishing the land after its
losses in World War II. The British took over for a decade and then
the Ethiopians assumed control. From 1961 to 1991, guerrilla
fighters battled the Ethiopians in a war that claimed 450,000
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, too soon, war runs Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the war is over, you cannot talk about the future. The
war is what is holding us up,'' said Massimo Guiseppe, 27, at the
American Bar on a recent night.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last seven or eight years, we have had a lot of change
economically and socially,'' said Medehanie Tarke, who works with
Massimo at a military base rebuilding old Ethiopian artillery.
``But now everyone is participating in the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Road projects have stopped. Eritrea's three Red Sea ports have
not been refurbished. New factories remain unopened. Foreign
investment has dried up. Tourists have stayed away.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, arms dealers flock to Asmara. Russian pilots have flown
in tons of weapons in unmarked planes. Cargo ships carry loads of
artillery into the port of Assab. And the government spent between
$120 million and $150 million on six fighter jets. Diplomats wonder
how one of the poorest countries in the world found the money. The
government says a portion, about $50 million in the past year, came
from expatriates' donations.
</P>
<P>
   While President Isaias Afwerki, the only president Eritrea has
known, retains great popularity, some Eritreans and Western
observers find fault with how his government operates with little
outside input. There is a high degree of secrecy here, with the
government expecting the country's new media voices to exercise
restraint in their criticisms. So far, they have.
</P>
<P>
   But when the war ends, questions are likely to emerge, analysts
say. There will be questions about how Eritrea and Ethiopia started
this war, which on the surface has been over land of little use.
Other questions concern the economy and whether the 200,000
fighters will have jobs upon their return. Another 200,000 people
were displaced by the war, and room will have to be made in Eritrea
for 60,000 people deported from Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists wonder about post-traumatic stress disorders for
soldiers who fought in battles that claimed thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is once the dust settles, how are they going to
deal with this?'' asked Dr. Tesfay Aradom, a Medford psychologist
and associate professor of social sciences at Roxbury Community
College. Tesfay traveled to the war front to talk with soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are conflicted by the situation,'' he said. ``I was
flabbergasted by the level of political sophistication that these
youngsters had. They all asked how this problem can be solved
politically. They know this war was partly unnecessary. At times,
they even hesitated to keep shooting. This was just killing people
like flies.''
</P>
<P>
   At the American Bar, the biggest fear that remains is of a war
without end.
</P>
<P>
   No one stated a belief that Ethiopia, with its 55 million
people, will win the war outright. But those at the cafe said
Ethiopians could fight for much longer, delaying Eritrea's bright
dreams and perhaps extinguishing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a time when people can't tolerate it anymore,''
said one young man, who asked not be identified. ``If we keep on
defending, defending, defending, the country collapses, more people
die, and what is there to come back for?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TSORONA, Eritrea _ Hard summer rains fall every afternoon here
on the border with Ethiopia, turning terra cotta earth into mud and
eroding a mile-long embankment. The dirt washes away little by
little, and nature gives a glimpse of hell.
</P>
<P>
   There, in the 7-foot-high mound, a boot has emerged.
</P>
<P>
   There, fingers.
</P>
<P>
   There, a face without eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The unspeakable happened here.
</P>
<P>
   It was a battle with tactics resurrected from World War I, as
wave upon wave of Ethiopian soldiers charged the trenches of their
Eritrean neighbors, only to die in mid-stride.
</P>
<P>
   Along this 1-mile stretch, more people were killed in three days
in March than in 78 days of fighting throughall of Kosovo. The
fallen formed a mass grave here that dwarfs any unearthed in the
Balkans over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   This, sadly, symbolizes the state of Africa at the end of the
millennium, a continent full of aspirations, new leadership, and
emerging democracies, but one that remains trigger-happy and that
tumbles into conflicts at frightening speed, often with the West
unable, or too disengaged, to broker a truce.
</P>
<P>
   It was only 16 months ago that President Clinton toured Africa
and called it ripe for renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Since that visit, the number of Africa's refugees has swollen by
more than 5 million, to 8.1 million people. Africa has more armed
conflicts than any other continent, with 11 large wars raging.
</P>
<P>
   The war here, in many ways a simple family feud between two
historically interlinked groups contesting a sparsely populated
620-mile frontier, has nonetheless claimed tens of thousands of
lives over the past 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   There is some hope for a negotiated cease-fire in the coming
weeks, as a US-backed initiative is being presented to both sides.
But both Eritrea and Ethiopia believe the process will be drawn
out, leaving ample time for new difficulties that could lead again
to violence.
</P>
<P>
   As the envoys shuttled between Addis Ababa and Asmara recently,
Birikhti Weldegergish, a slender 21-year-old Eritrean soldier
wearing a long cotton skirt and a camouflage shirt, stood near the
mass grave on the Tsorona front and quietly spoke about what had
happened in the epic battle.
</P>
<P>
   For three days and nights beginning March 14, she and other
soldiers said, the Ethiopians charged at Eritrean positions on the
disputed border, first from behind the cover of tanks and then in
the open when missiles disabled the tanks. Eritrean mortars then
blew up hundreds of soldiers, land mines sent hundreds more flying
in the air like stunt actors and Birikhti and her fellow soldiers
shot many of the rest from their trenches.
</P>
<P>
   It was disorientingly easy to kill, she recalled, like a target
practice that wouldn't end. They shot until their Kalishnikov
rifles and machine guns grew scorchingly hot, burning skin off
their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't understand the way the Ethiopians came in at us,'' she
said, the muscles under her left eye twitching nervously as she
spoke. ``They were coming like ants.''
</P>
<P>
   When the shooting was over, Birikhti looked at the field.
</P>
<P>
   Only there was no field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no land to step on,'' she said. ``It was all dead
bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the battle, Eritrean soldiers removed identity
papers from the dead, collected rifles and ammunition, piled the
bodies behind the trenches and bulldozed dirt over them. Eritrea
says 10,000 soldiers were killed. Ethiopia scoffs at the number,
suggesting hundreds were killed. Western diplomats in both nations
and military analysts in Washington lean toward the higher,
Eritrean figure.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the only sure fact is the Eritrean soldiers eat, sleep,
talk and play checkers with Coca-Cola bottletops along this front
line, a front that's a mass grave, a grave that opens further with
each day's rain, a rain that unlocks the scent of old death. The
scent is inhaled with every breath of the living, the living living
in hell.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the world's bloodiest war.
</P>
<P>
   It is a war senseless to most outsiders. Analysts argue over why
it began: Some say it's over land that is of little value; others
call it a fight for sovereignty; still others point to
long-simmering problems between the countries' governments and the
two leaders, distant cousins who each owe the other for being in
power in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   It is often called the world's forgotten war, waged in obscurity
because reporters have had little access to the fighting, diplomats
have been forbidden to go to the front lines, and, for at least a
portion of it, the West was obsessed with Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Geography and racism are also to blame. ``We sadly accept a
level of violence in Africa,'' said former US Agency for
International Development chief J. Brian Atwood, ``that we wouldn't
accept in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The fatigues-clad soldiers here on the front, baking flatbread
amid the gunfire, have a blunter explanation. ``The international
organizations have forgotten us. There has been incredible
bloodshed and destruction here . . . someone should have
interfered,'' said Tsegaye Teame, 28.
</P>
<P>
   World leaders, much like Rip van Winkle in their reawakening to
a world beyond Pristina, have recently begun to focus on the
multiple wars and crises in Africa, although still not promising
much.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, in a speech on Africa
last month, acknowledged that the West has been ``able to do far
more to end conflicts in Europe than in Africa.'' She said it was a
partly a matter of stronger regional organizations in Europe, but
added, ``That is no excuse for disengaging or giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the world's tragically late response to the genocide
in Rwanda in 1994, a slaughter that killed more than 500,000
people, Albright said, ``We must do all we can now to see that such
a nightmare is never repeated.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Washington has faced new hurdles in the region in the
year since US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed by an
Islamic extremist. Africa has borne the brunt of the 70 US
diplomatic missions closed temporarily in the past 12 months
because of security concerns, an issue that was heightened on
Thursday when the State Department warned all Americans abroad of
possible attacks related to the anniversary of the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   In recent reports, the United Nations and the State Department
highlighted the enormity of the problems on the continent: the 11
major conflicts; the threat of famine for millions in Ethiopia,
Somalia, and Sudan; the millions of refugees; and the frenzy of
small weapons sales, with some AK-47s selling for as little as $6
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   All that doesn't even touch the epidemic of AIDS in Sub-Saharan
Africa, including Zimbabwe, where 4 out of every 10 adults are
reportedly infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   From the US perspective, the explosion of conflict in Africa is
especially troubling as it follows Washington's effort last year to
link the continent with the global economy and promote emerging
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his 11-day trip to Africa, his longest ever outside
the United States as president, Clinton told Africans that he
wanted to introduce America to a ``new Africa _ an Africa whose
political and economic accomplishments grow more impressive each
month.''
</P>
<P>
   He spotlighted a region with impressive mineral resources, labor
possibilities, and huge economic potential.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited several African leaders as part of the continent's
new hope, including Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea, Meles Zenawi of
Ethiopia, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, and Paul Kagame of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Today all four nations are involved in war. Eritrea and Ethiopia
are shooting at each other, and Uganda and Rwanda are sending arms
and troops to rebel groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   The conflicts each have their own complex roots, but diplomats
and analysts say one common theme is that independence movements
filled the vacuum of receding superpowers after the Cold War.
Several analysts said many of the ascendant leaders believe the
only way to resolve certain political or economic problems is
through force.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the end of the Cold War, the lid has come off on a lot of
the instability,'' speeding up moves to sort through new
leadership, said a longtime Africa watcher, Dan Connell, a
Gloucester resident and author of ``Against All Odds: A Chronicle
of the Eritrean Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Connell said, ``African countries are making decisions
on their own immediate needs rather than their colonial masters. It
makes for really chaotic politics sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Connell compared Africa today with Europe in its bloody 16th and
17th centuries. Others compare the current Ethiopian-Eritrean
battle to the War of 1812 between the United States and Britain, a
war fought partly because a colonial master never fully reconciled
itself to the ceding of territory to a new nation.

calling it ripe for renaissance. Since then, the number of Africa's

 &HT;    Lawn beauty is in the eye of the neighbor
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ A 51-year-old artist who shapes colorful
sculptures from
</P>
<P>
   discarded materials such as furniture, lamps, and kitchenware,
has raised the
</P>
<P>
   hackles of her less creative neighbors in an upscale bedroom
community outside
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland by painting an old clawfoot bathtub green, planting it
with red poppies, yellow and peach day lilies and mountain sage _
and putting it in the front yard.
</P>
<P>
   The horrified neighbors set up a grumble that was heard in City
Hall. In response to duty's call, the mayor made the following
statement: ``I maintain that you have to have certain standards.
Today it's a bathtub. Tomorrow it could be toilets.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice mayor agreed: ``I don't want a bathtub in the front
yard. I just don't think it looks great.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, in a daring move to protect the aesthetics of the
surrounding
</P>
<P>
   high-dollar landscape as well as the delicate sensibilities of
the neighbors, the City Council has amended a section of the
building code now making it unlawful to put out-of-use stuff like
bathtubs and toilets in front yards.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining about the folks we live next door to, or across the
street from is, of course, an inalienable right that can probably
be traced back to our cave dwelling days. Norman Neanderthal comes
home from work and listens to his wife Buffy complain because the
cavetrash across the gulch have just painted their cavern purple.
And bought an ugly dog. Buffy worries about property values. Norman
is afraid the undesirable's son will want to marry his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   And there you have it. Neighborhood unrest in the Pleistocene
age.
</P>
<P>
   It happened where I lived once, when I was a little girl. My
mother started it.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the '40s, south Florida was awash in flamingoes. Folks
had them everywhere _ standing on one leg next to the jasmine,
guarding a mildewed
</P>
<P>
   birdbath. Mr. Morton, our across-the-street neighbor and my
father's fishing
</P>
<P>
   buddy, had one on his screen door. It was a brightly-painted
metal thing that
</P>
<P>
   covered most of the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tacky,'' my mother decreed. ``Ugly bird,'' Daddy agreed. A
couple of weeks
</P>
<P>
   after the bird went up my mother cracked down. The bird had to
go. My father
</P>
<P>
   told her is was not their business what people hung on their
screen doors and she was to get over it. Mother insisted it hurt
her eyes. Daddy told her not to look at it.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, just before her Sunday school group was to meet in
our living room, Mother dispatched my father to tell his old friend
to ditch the bird. Daddy ambled across the street, had a talk with
Mort, and reported a successful mission to my mother. Told her not
to worry.
</P>
<P>
   By morning the flamingo had flown and Mr. Mort was working in
his front yard lily pond. Mother sighed her relief. Daddy said
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Early evening, just moments before the ladies were due to
arrive, Daddy excused himself and went outside. Mother fussed with
the teacups and issued an
</P>
<P>
   ultimatum _ either I bathed and put on a clean dress or I was
banished to my room for the duration. Since neither idea appealed
to me, I sneaked out the back door while Mother was busy pouring
cashews in a cut-glass bowl. I found my
</P>
<P>
   father and Mr. Mort in lawn chairs beside the lily pond. They
looked a little sheepish. It didn't take long to see why.
</P>
<P>
   Not 20 yards from where the Sunday school ladies would be
parking their Packards, Mr. Mort had installed a stone cherub
incessantly relieving itself in his lily pond.
</P>
<P>
   The ladies were not amused and Mother had a sinking spell that
lasted 14 years until Mr. Mort moved to Kissimmee and took his
``obscene trash'' (my mother's label) with him. Daddy missed his
fishing buddy and the neighborhood kids missed Sprinkles, which is
what we had dubbed the leaky babe.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there's hope for the artist's bathtub. Maybe they'll plumb
it, hang a shower curtain around it and make it legal by putting it
``back in use.'' Maybe later they could add a toilet.

 &HT;    Pious politicos dare not swear on stack of Bibles
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In ``Liar, Liar,'' Jim Carrey portrays an attorney
cursed with a spell that renders him unable to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon to theaters near you: ``Oh, God, What a Bunch of
Liars. `` Carrey stars as Pat Robertson. George Burns returns as
God.
</P>
<P>
   All right, that's not true. It's a lie.
</P>
<P>
   But you'd need a full-length motion picture to do justice to the
way Robertson's Christian Coalition mutilates No. 9 of the 10
Commandments it would post on public school walls. That's the
shalt-not against bearing false witness.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders what other commandments the coalition has ground
into powder in its efforts to get where and what it wants. Are
there any witnesses in cement shoes at the bottom of Chesapeake Bay
who could tell us how deceitful and cynical this so-called
Christian organization has been?
</P>
<P>
   Simply by doing the math, one would wonder: Who's killing all
the Christians in the Coalition? We've had either (1) a bloodbath
or (2) one of history's biggest put-ons.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Coalition was claiming that it had 2.8 million
members and thriving affiliates in 48 states. Last week the
organization acknowledged that affiliates were skeletal in all but
seven states.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times, quoting current and former staffers,
reported that the names of thousands of dead people had been used
to inflate membership rolls, and that the Coalition printed
millions of voter guides that it never expected to be distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Sources acknowledged that shipping stacks and stacks of these
propaganda sheets wasn't the same as getting them distributed, as
the Coalition had claimed. Many pastors refused to play a
calculated political game, while some did no more than let the
voters guides collect dust in the foyer. Even more stacks went
right to recycling centers.
</P>
<P>
   Most brazenly, Coalition staffers were caught in an act of
illusion. During press tours at the Chesapeake Bay national
headquarters, the Times reported that ``a roving group of employees
leapfrogged ahead of the reporters to fill empty offices and
telephones.'' It's right out of Mission Impossible. A bunch of
actors, they were. Was that Tom Cruise at the copier? Martin Landau
on the phone?
</P>
<P>
   Has the Christian Coalition, like a taped message in a glove
compartment, self-destructed?
</P>
<P>
   It's still there, and still strong in some states, like Texas.
But what's happened is that it's been revealed for what it truly
is, a partisan brotherhood with the scruples of the mob.
</P>
<P>
   In June the Internal Revenue Service said, ``Jig's up, Bugsy.''
It revoked the Coalition's tax-free status citing the group's
hand-in-hand efforts with the Republican Party, whose nomination
Robertson has sought as presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second shoe to drop. In 1996 the Federal Election
Commission declared it a partisan organization and required it to
register as a political action committee.
</P>
<P>
   All along the Coalition has known what it was doing and why. It
was trying to get as far as it could without the truth coming to
bear.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of movies, Toto just pulled back the curtain on the
Great ... the Powerful ... the _ look, Dorothy _ it's just another
corrupt political machine.

 &HT;    Discussion should replace dispute in health care debate
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ On both ends of the political spectrum, people
are saying the problem with the health care debate is that it's
about how to regulate managed care instead of how to replace it.
Lawmakers are arguing over whether HMOs should be liable in
lawsuits when they ought to be asking whether managed care should
be viable.
</P>
<P>
   The left and the right each have better ideas. They even have a
lot in common, but our Crossfire culture sadly encourages them to
get in each other's faces instead of putting their heads together.
</P>
<P>
   One premise they share is that employers should not buy most of
the private health care in this country, using their money and
other people's. The government finances health care by not taxing
the money employers spend on it. Patients finance health care not
only by paying premiums, deductibles and coinsurance, but also by
subsidizing managed care when they pay list price for, say,
prescriptions that HMO members get at discount.
</P>
<P>
   And employers, patients and the government all pay for the
nearly one in every five Americans younger than 65 without health
coverage _ 44 million and growing.
</P>
<P>
   In the liberal national health care proposals, the government
would control that money and guarantee every American basic
coverage for preventive and emergency care and treatment for
illness or injury. As in Germany, the coverage could be
administered by private insurers, says Vernellia Randall, a
University of Dayton law professor who was a nurse for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only two developed nations in the world _ the United States
and South Africa _ do not provide some sort of national health care
system,'' says Randall, who began studying the issue on a White
House advisory group in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In the conservative proposals, government tax breaks would
divert all the money now spent on health care to the patients, who
then would set up medical savings accounts (MSAs) to pay for
ordinary health care and insurance against catastrophic costs. They
could buy a basic plan or the health care equivalent of all the
premium channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is control,'' says Dr. David Westbrock, who has
run for Congress twice as a Montgomery County Republican. ``I've
had a lot of HMO executives tell me, `The patients need us
controlling their health care to tell them how to judge quality.'
``
</P>
<P>
   The left wants universal coverage. The right wants patients to
choose their own health care. These are not mutually exclusive
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals have significant conflicts, certainly. Liberals
question the wisdom of giving poor people the chance to spend
dollars meant for health care on other things, whether it's food or
street drugs. Conservatives are put off by another arm of
paternalistic government.
</P>
<P>
   But they agree on taking employers out of the system and taking
medical decisions away from insurers. They agree the current system
wastes money because it's expensive both to manage health care and
to treat the uninsured in emergency rooms and surgical suites
instead of preventing their crises. They agree that health care is
now rationed to people with the most money and the largest
employers in the most populous counties.
</P>
<P>
   They also agree on the need to remove both the old economic
incentives for too many tests and procedures and managed care's
incentives for too few.
</P>
<P>
   Randall isn't suggesting Clintonesque health reform that would
confine everyone to an HMO. Far from it, she says, ``When you have
a system run by private enterprises whose ultimate responsibility
is to the stockholder, at some point they have to cut into
necessary services in order to increase stockholders' profits.''
</P>
<P>
   If patients had the money to buy their own health care,
Westbrock says the free market would also tilt that responsibility
toward the patients. But he's not suggesting a market so unfettered
that it would abandon the sickest and poorest. He says it's
terrible that his diabetic patients can't get health coverage
unless they work for big employers. He says those fortunate enough
to be healthy should be happy to subsidize the sicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would put a surcharge on the healthy,'' he says. ``Those
numbers have been worked out and they're very attainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Both ideas would improve health care at lower costs. Too bad the
parties can't discuss them instead of merely disputing them.

 &HT;    Discussion should replace dispute in health care debate
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ On both ends of the political spectrum, people
are saying the problem with the health care debate is that it's
about how to regulate managed care instead of how to replace it.
Lawmakers are arguing over whether HMOs should be liable in
lawsuits when they ought to be asking whether managed care should
be viable.
</P>
<P>
   The left and the right each have better ideas. They even have a
lot in common, but our Crossfire culture sadly encourages them to
get in each other's faces instead of putting their heads together.
</P>

 &HT;    College lessons: Set good spending habits now
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Spending is easy.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part is managing your spending. That takes both
education and maturity. If truth were known, I'm still working on
both.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, I understand why money management raises problems for
college students, especially freshmen who are on their own for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   For their families, the challenge is turning potential problems
into part of the learning experience. The process is nothing fancy.
Mainly it deals with budgeting, controlling credit card spending
and _ most important _ building a one-adult-to-another dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing is talk to your students about money,'' says
Nancy McDuff, the University of Georgia's undergraduate admissions
director. ``You don't make it a taboo topic, so a student comes to
you only when there's a crisis. Let them know you're helping them
but that you expect them to act as adults.''
</P>
<P>
   For this year's freshmen, the time is now. If you want to teach,
jump in before the adventures of college start and while you can
still get your youngster's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Budgeting is the first big step. Parents need to sit down with
their child to draw up a realistic spending plan.
</P>
<P>
   You want your freshman to know how much he or she will have to
spend and what responsibilities go with it.
</P>
<P>
   It's best to make up a detailed budget, with spending targets
both for necessities _ laundry and school supplies, for instance _
and for amenities such as movies and pizzas.
</P>
<P>
   Believe me, it's easier to control your spending if you know the
limits for each category.
</P>
<P>
   Parents may know the total they can put out for personal
spending. Even so, it's better to work it out item by item, rather
than starting with the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Many colleges provide helpful estimates of the year's expenses,
including personal spending as well as tuition, fees and room and
board. At UGA, the recommendation is $1,800 for the school year, or
$200 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet there are students who can do it cheaper, and lots of
students who can do it more expensively,'' McDuff said. ``But it's
a good starting point.''
</P>
<P>
   You're not through yet. At your budget meeting, the family needs
to schedule a budget review. Make it a month or more into the
school year, perhaps a part of your student's first trip home.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, urge your freshman to keep a spending diary. A
detailed record of actual spending will make it possible to see if
your spending limits are realistic. Make it clear the review is
neither snoopy nor punitive.
</P>
<P>
   Credit management is the second major step.
</P>
<P>
   Banks and credit card companies want to be the first to issue
their credit cards to your children. The companies hope those new
customers will stick with them for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   But easy credit is a tremendous temptation to all of us. Buying
stuff with plastic doesn't seem real. It's more like play money.
</P>
<P>
   One way to inculcate responsibility is to sanction your
freshman's first credit card. Setting up a joint account allows
parents to monitor the use of the card and lets the student know
that he or she really is answerable to somebody.
</P>
<P>
   The family should establish in advance what the card can be used
for. Your list might include textbooks and airfare to come home at
Christmas, for example, but not restaurant meals or spring break.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide the card can be used in emergencies, take time to
define what an emergency is. Another possibility is to use a debit
card. Parents or students can deposit a given amount in the bank.
The user can't charge any more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, keep your lines of communication open and try to
help your student along. ``College is all about education,'' McDuff
pointed out. ``Students spend about 25 percent of their time in the
classroom, but they learn all the time. Parents should be part of
that process.''
</P>
<P>
   DOING IT RIGHT
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't plunk down a full semester's spending money at one time.
It's too hard to stretch that out over several months.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you fear your student will scrimp on things like textbooks
or calling home, put them in a separate budget category. Let your
student know you will cover or reimburse those expenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ If this is your student's first checking account, make sure he
or she knows how to write checks and balance a checkbook. Don't
forget the part about recording ATM withdrawals in your checkbook.
If you get a balance from the ATM, be sure to take into account
outstanding checks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Put aside some money to set up your student's first dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stay cool. You made mistakes, and so will your children. As
you work them out, go for learning rather than discipline.

 &HT;    Conference aims to educate `polio people' on overcoming health
challenges
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When she started falling down unexpectedly as an
adult, Shirlee Sussman wrote it off to the unsteady way she walked
on the side of her foot. She had, after all, come down with polio
when she was 2. Her left leg never grew to the size of her right
leg, and she always limped.
</P>
<P>
   She had no idea that polio, tragic enough when the virus
strikes, often comes back to cripple its victims again later in
life. Neither did the doctors she saw in the 1960s and '70s, even
as her pain level gradually grew and her fatigue threshold
gradually fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to the doctor and they tell you, 'There's no reason for
you to be falling. Maybe you need to go see a psychiatrist,' ''
Sussman says. ``That's very prevalent in the post-polio community,
being told you're a nut case.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery was unraveled in the early 1980s by Dr. Lauro
Halstead, himself a polio survivor whose coordination seemed to be
deteriorating. ``I thought of myself as cured,'' Halstead said, but
his research showed the experiences of polio people 30 to 40 years
after their infection was neither imaginary nor coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   Halstead coined the term post-polio syndrome, characterized by
progressive muscle weakness, debilitating fatigue and pain,
especially in joints and muscles. To Sussman, her diagnosis at 49
was a relief, finally explaining all those symptoms and identifying
her new challenge to overcome. But even now, she says, many people
who've had polio still don't understand what's happening to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary purpose of this conference is to educate them,
teach them exactly what did happen when they got polio,'' says
Sussman, now 65 and chairwoman of the Ohio Polio Network's biannual
post-polio conference Aug. 21 in Dayton. The conference is for
anyone who has had polio, whether or not they have been diagnosed
with post-polio syndrome, and their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers will talk about the syndrome, aging, exercise, massage
and anger management. ``There's a lot of anger involved,'' Sussman
says, ``because there's grief any time you have to give up
something, whether it's a loved one or part of your being.'' There
also is a lot of denial, she says, recalling many calls ``from
people who really don't want to admit that this is in fact what's
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Polio people are an unusually driven population, says
Halstead, who directs the post-polio program at the National
Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington. His data shows they average
more education than the general population, marry and raise
families at the same rate and have an employment rate four times
greater than that of other disabled people. Generally reluctant to
admit any weakness, they call themselves simply ``polio people'' or
``polios'' instead of using the word victim or survivor.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Most of us overused our muscles and kind of pretended we
never had any limitations,'' Sussman says. ``We were so determined
to be just like everybody else, to our detriment later on.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The cause of post-polio syndrome is not known for sure, but
the accepted theory is that people overcoming paralytic polio
simply wear themselves out in compensating for their disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sussman, for example, was paralyzed below the waist, but after
she reached her maximum recovery at the age of 8, she thought
nothing of walking the mile and a half each way to school with all
her friends. But however robust she acted, polio had destroyed many
of her motor neurons, and the remaining ones had to work much
harder to operate her muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neighboring nerve cells that took over for those killed by
the virus are now wearing out,'' says Dr. Jane Wootton, who directs
a nationally renowned polio clinic in Richmond, Va., and will speak
at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Sussman compares the pain with that of an amputee who still
feels the limb he has lost, because polio has killed the nerves
where she is hurting. ``My hips are always in pain,'' she says, as
are her shoulders and neck and the muscles that control both her
feet and ankles, from below the knee on down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned to pace myself. That is super-important,'' says
Sussman, who still runs her business brokering materials for paper
manufacturers from home with her husband. ``If you do too much
today, for the next three or four days you're going to pay for it
dearly because you'll have more pain and be so tired.''
</P>
<P>
   There's little treatment for PPS besides rest and light
exercise, although Wootton says symptoms can be eased by a variety
of professionals including therapists, orthotists, counselors,
nutritionists and clergy. Many post-polios diagnose themselves, but
Sussman says it's important to get a physician's diagnosis in order
to establish the patient's need for exercise and other help.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is there are so few doctors with dedicated polio
specialties. She knows of none in the Dayton area but one in
Cincinnati. Without that specialty, she says, ``There's really a
lack of understanding and knowledge of what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Sussman could never run and play with other kids and was sad
that she couldn't wear high heels, but she learned to dance and
could excel with the best of them in academics and music.
Successful in business, the Northmont Rotarian became the first
woman to lead the Ohio Chamber of Commerce's small business
council. ``Whenever I talk to anybody I went to high school with,
they say, `We just didn't notice.' ''
</P>
<P>
   People with polio learned it had to be that way. It's never been
easy for the disabled to fit in, and polio in particular was a
national nightmare until the Sabin and Salk vaccines in 1955 and
1961 all but ended it in this country. It struck 50,000 Americans
in 1952 alone, killing nearly one in eight, and estimates range
from 640,000 to 1.6 million living Americans who have had polio.
Between 40 percent and 75 percent of them develop PPS, which is
more than 250,000 at the low end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made me very different than my three brothers,'' Sussman
says. ``Much more accepting of the things in my life, and I don't
take them as obstacles. They're challenges to be overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason polio people have higher rates of high blood
pressure, for example, is even just walking is stressful. Sussman
wasn't aware until a post-polio doctor pointed it out that she
always clenched her fist when she walked. ``It takes total
concentration,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She can't walk for long anymore, but she uses a scooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes me as mobile as anybody else,'' Sussman says. ``I'm
still more active than many of my friends the same age who never
had polio.''

 &HT;    Infiniti I30 gives luxury real meaning
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In any field, a few wonders occasionally rise _ things
or situations that have no reasonable explanation.
</P>
<P>
   The Infiniti I30 might fall into that category in the automotive
arena.
</P>
<P>
   The I30 is a really nice car. It's comfortable and offers a
silky smooth drive to the entry-level luxury market. At 227
horsepower and 217 pounds-feet of torque on the 2000 model, it
offers one of the most potent powerplants available in the
under-$35,000 luxury segment.
</P>
<P>
   So why doesn't the brand make any noise? The I30's 3.0-liter V-6
has been named one of the 10 best engines by Ward's Auto World for
five consecutive years. When the model was introduced in 1995,
Kiplinger's Personal Finance declared the I30 the best new car in
the $25,000-$35,000 price range. In 1996, IntellicChoice lauded the
I30 as having the lowest maintenance costs in its class.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Power and Associates recognized the I30 in its 1997 Initial
Quality Study as best in class. Kiplinger's continued to applaud
the I30 in '98, voting it best in the $25,000-$35,000 class. And
Infiniti has a strong record of reliability.
</P>
<P>
   The number of vintage Datsun/Nissan products I see daily on the
roadways intrigues me. There appears to be a continuing presence of
510s, Sentras, 200 SXs, Pulsars and Maximas.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the I30 were up 20 percent for the '99 model year, and
Infiniti acknowledges the I30 was one of its most valuable players.
Infiniti is set to begin capitalizing on the I30's increased sales
strength with the introduction of the 2000 model I30.
</P>
<P>
   Infiniti's parent company, Nissan Motor Corp., recently got a
capital investment by French automaker Renault, which should
provide the financial foundation for all of Nissan's product lines
to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Along with its nearly 20 percent increase in power, the 2000 I30
will also get a retuned rear suspension, Xenon headlamps, advanced
traction control system, more-sensitive anti-lock brakes, larger
wheels and tires, and a standard 200-watt Bose audio system.
Enhanced safety features include a new head-restraint system
designed to reduce whiplash.
</P>
<P>
   A timely new feature will be the availability of a
power-operated rear sunshade, which tests have indicated can
provide nine-degree reduction in cabin temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Infiniti also will offer the Infiniti Communicator, which uses
cell phone technology and the Global Positioning Satellite system
to provide emergency and roadside assistance along with general
travel services.

   ATLANTA _ Not even Saabophiles, loyalist lot that they are, can
resist the temptation to pun when talking about the Swedish
automaker's latest step in auto safety: They're dogging it.
</P>
<P>
   That's right _ safety belts, restraints and other accessories
designed to provide safer and more comfortable travel for dogs and
their masters who own the '99 Saab 9-5 front-wheel-drive wagon.
</P>
<P>
   They work, too. Or at least they restrained the frequently
rambunctious Bud and Charlie, a mutually devoted pair of mostly Lab
companions, during testing of a 9-5 wagon. Bud, the older, seemed
happily restrained in the cargo area, while Charles, a hyper
class-clown type, actually remained sedately tethered to a
rear-seat safety belt. Neither was slipping and sliding the way
dogs frequently do during starts, turns and stops.
</P>
<P>
   As for the wagon itself, a nimble 3,700-pounder that can handle
five humans and 37 cubic feet of cargo in the rear, it's a very
nonwagon sort of vehicle to drive. Between its turbocharged
170-horsepower engine and sporting suspension, it accelerates
quickly, is responsive at speed and rides quite nicely.
</P>
<P>
   With the only options _ excluding the doggie equipment _ being
the four-speed automatic transmission and several seat choices, the
9-5 wagon's standard equipment seems to justify the base price of
$31,850 (it totaled $36,170, plus about $250 for dog accessories).
</P>
<P>
   Saab, which seems to stage a test crash every other business day
in the interest of safety, could hardly have picked a more
opportune time to introduce the dog safety items. Author Stephen
King's injuries, suffered earlier this year when an unruly
Rottweiler caused its owner/driver to swerve and strike the
strolling King, set off a flurry of interest in protecting pets and
pedestrians, too.
</P>
<P>
   Saab's catalog, which offers clothing and sports gear as well as
auto accessories, devotes four pages to the dogs. For safety,
there's a $24.95 harness, a $19.95 belt for seat-riding dogs, a
$49.95 leash that restrains dogs in the rear, and a $69.95 carrier
for smaller dogs and cats that will also fit under airplane seats.
</P>
<P>
   That, as usual, is not the only mention of aircraft in analyzing
Saab vehicles. Its early involvement with aviation helps account
for the true cockpit styling of the 9-3 and 9-5 vehicles. The
dual-cockpit front gives a secure feeling, while the instruments
and controls are readily available.
</P>
<P>
   Saab contends that its console-mounted ignition switch makes
sense because operating it leaves the driver's hand close to the
shift selector. Logical, yes, but that doesn't mean it's easy to
reprogram drivers used to traditionally located ignitions.
</P>
<P>
   Get behind the wheel, and Saab's thoughtfulness is readily
apparent in, among other things, convenient drink holders, a
wide-angle mirror on the passenger side, a clip on the lower left
windshield to hold parking permits or other documents, and an
optional sliding rear floor that facilitates tailgating.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom-liners will find it difficult to fault Saab for the
interior, despite the forever-quirky exterior styling. But how can
anyone possibly fault an automaker that wants to make a dog's life
even better and safer?
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1999 Saab 9-5 front-wheel-drive wagon
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $36,170 (base: $31,850)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine (170
horsepower), optional four-speed automatic transmission with
normal, sport and winter modes
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual-front air bags, driver and front passenger
side/head air bags, spring-loaded anti-whiplash front seats, power
anti-lock disc brakes, three-point belts at all seats,
semiautomatic height adjustment for outboard seats, wide-angle
passenger side mirror, daytime running lights
</P>
<P>
   Other options on test vehicle: leather interior, $1,350; heated
and fan-ventilated front seats and heated rear seats, $520;
integrated child booster seat, $300;dealer-installed sliding load
floor, $425
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 19 mpg city; 26 mpg highway

 &HT;    Always warm up car before emissions test
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's time I answered some of your letters, which have
been accumulating over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   First, I receive many requests for copies of past articles, many
of them accompanied by stamped, self-addressed envelopes. I'm not
ignoring you.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, when I want to read my column, I have to buy
a Friday paper just like everyone else. I don't have a copy machine
or fax, thus I have no way to forward the published columns myself.
However, the AJC provides this service to readers for a nominal
fee. Please call 404-526-5668 and save your stamps.
</P>
<P>
   On to the mailbag:
</P>
<P>
   John Schiereck and Mary Sherman e-mailed questions and comments
pertaining to emissions tests.
</P>
<P>
   John writes, ``I have a 1987 Buick that failed the emissions
test. COCarbon monoxide was twice the acceptable level. I always
use 93 octane fuel because the poor old girl knocks and pings with
anything less. Anyway, I put about $2 of cheap gas (87 octane) in
an empty tank and had it retested. She passes with flying colors.
The carbon monoxide was one-tenth of the acceptable level. Can you
explain why?''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Sherman writes, ``You failed to mention that if the engine
is cold, it will fail the emission test no matter the age or
condition of the car. You should have advised: Drive the car for 30
or more minutes and have it retested before you spend another dime
on a book or mechanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary is absolutely right. As I've advised in several previous
emissions columns, your vehicle should be driven, preferably at
highway speed, before getting in the test lane. This ensures that
the vehicle's engine computer _ assuming the rest of the system is
working correctly _ has had ample time to take control of things.
</P>
<P>
   A cold engine, especially with older vehicles, is a prime
candidate for a carbon monoxide failure. This could be the reason
for John's first failure.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect this more than the change in fuel octane. That alone
would not have resulted in such a major improvement in exhaust gas
readings.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Junius writes: ``My '85 S10 pickup's wipers will not park
when turned off. It is a regular two-speed wiper. Is the problem in
the wiper motor itself, or is there another part that parks the
wipers?''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the truck has not been recently painted, and the
ground circuit for the wipers has not been disturbed, the parking
circuit for the windshield wipers is contained in the cover, which
is part of the motor assembly but not part of the actual motor
itself. (Some parts stores sell only the motor assembly with the
cover as a unit, and some sell the cover with the circuit board
separately.)
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tod Rieger writes: ``Thanks for the recommendation to
retrofit an air-conditioning system only when the situation is
extreme. I have a 1985 system that hasn't had any R-12 added since
1993, and it seems to need some more. If that is all it needs, I'll
skip the retrofit. You also mentioned `other refrigerants.' Is
FR-12 one of those?''
</P>
<P>
   I would strongly recommend steering clear of any refrigerants
other than R-12 and R134A.
</P>
<P>
   Although the other refrigerants, FR-12 included, may perform
well when the air-conditioning system is retrofitted to use them,
it could prove to be a nightmare should you need service down the
road. FR-12 is a blend refrigerant and cannot be recycled. Most
shops are not equipped to service these systems and dispose of the
refrigerant.

 &HT;    College lessons: Set good spending habits now
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Spending is easy.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part is managing your spending. That takes both
education and maturity. If truth were known, I'm still working on
both.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, I understand why money management raises problems for
college students, especially freshmen who are on their own for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   For their families, the challenge is turning potential problems
into part of the learning experience. The process is nothing fancy.
Mainly it deals with budgeting, controlling credit card spending
and _ most important _ building a one-adult-to-another dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing is talk to your students about money,'' says
Nancy McDuff, the University of Georgia's undergraduate admissions
director. ``You don't make it a taboo topic, so a student comes to
you only when there's a crisis. Let them know you're helping them
but that you expect them to act as adults.''
</P>
<P>
   For this year's freshmen, the time is now. If you want to teach,
jump in before the adventures of college start and while you can
still get your youngster's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Budgeting is the first big step. Parents need to sit down with
their child to draw up a realistic spending plan.
</P>
<P>
   You want your freshman to know how much he or she will have to
spend and what responsibilities go with it.
</P>
<P>
   It's best to make up a detailed budget, with spending targets
both for necessities _ laundry and school supplies, for instance _
and for amenities such as movies and pizzas.
</P>
<P>
   Believe me, it's easier to control your spending if you know the
limits for each category.
</P>
<P>
   Parents may know the total they can put out for personal
spending. Even so, it's better to work it out item by item, rather
than starting with the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Many colleges provide helpful estimates of the year's expenses,
including personal spending as well as tuition, fees and room and
board. At UGA, the recommendation is $1,800 for the school year, or
$200 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet there are students who can do it cheaper, and lots of
students who can do it more expensively,'' McDuff said. ``But it's
a good starting point.''
</P>
<P>
   You're not through yet. At your budget meeting, the family needs
to schedule a budget review. Make it a month or more into the
school year, perhaps a part of your student's first trip home.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, urge your freshman to keep a spending diary. A
detailed record of actual spending will make it possible to see if
your spending limits are realistic. Make it clear the review is
neither snoopy nor punitive.
</P>
<P>
   Credit management is the second major step.
</P>
<P>
   Banks and credit card companies want to be the first to issue
their credit cards to your children. The companies hope those new
customers will stick with them for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   But easy credit is a tremendous temptation to all of us. Buying
stuff with plastic doesn't seem real. It's more like play money.
</P>
<P>
   One way to inculcate responsibility is to sanction your
freshman's first credit card. Setting up a joint account allows
parents to monitor the use of the card and lets the student know
that he or she really is answerable to somebody.
</P>
<P>
   The family should establish in advance what the card can be used
for. Your list might include textbooks and airfare to come home at
Christmas, for example, but not restaurant meals or spring break.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide the card can be used in emergencies, take time to
define what an emergency is. Another possibility is to use a debit
card. Parents or students can deposit a given amount in the bank.
The user can't charge any more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, keep your lines of communication open and try to
help your student along. ``College is all about education,'' McDuff
pointed out. ``Students spend about 25 percent of their time in the
classroom, but they learn all the time. Parents should be part of
that process.''
</P>
<P>
   DOING IT RIGHT
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't plunk down a full semester's spending money at one time.
It's too hard to stretch that out over several months.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you fear your student will scrimp on things like textbooks
or calling home, put them in a separate budget category. Let your
student know you will cover or reimburse those expenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ If this is your student's first checking account, make sure he
or she knows how to write checks and balance a checkbook. Don't
forget the part about recording ATM withdrawals in your checkbook.
If you get a balance from the ATM, be sure to take into account
outstanding checks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Put aside some money to set up your student's first dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stay cool. You made mistakes, and so will your children. As
you work them out, go for learning rather than discipline.

 &HT;    Pet safety takes front seat at Saab

 &HT;    She's happy as a clam _ and some say half-baked
 &HT;    By Patrick Beach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ During the past year of abuse, derision and
mockery, Pam Johnson has heard it all: That she's an agent of the
religious right or, worse, Hallmark cards. That's she's delusional,
or starting a cult. Ann Landers and comedian Richard Lewis, who
would seem to have nothing whatsoever in common, have in Johnson a
shared enemy.
</P>
<P>
   All this happened because a year ago Sunday _ on 8/8/98 _ Pam
Johnson of suburban Dallas came out of the happiness closet after
33 years.
</P>
<P>
   No more fear, no more denial, no more secrets. She proclaimed
herself aggressively, unapologetically happy and hoped you were the
same. And if you were, she hoped you would talk about it, that you
would not keep your happiness under a basket.
</P>
<P>
   She started the Secret Society of Happy People, mounted a
campaign to declare Aug. 8 National Admit You're Happy Day and soon
found herself the most despised woman in America.
</P>
<P>
   Because really, deep down, don't you hate happy people? Isn't it
time to rewrite that children's song? Stop clapping your hands. If
you're happy and you know it, KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say that, in this age of global media and
``woundology'' (Johnson's term) in which recovery is not a process
but an industry, this sales rep from Coppell hit a nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have people call and yell and hang up on you,'' she said.
``You say the word 'happy' to them, and they get antagonistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's an antagonistic July 26 posting from www.sohp.com, the
society's Web site. The subject line says, ``YOU PEOPLE NEED TO GET
A LIFE,'' but with a very bad, very descriptive word between ``a''
and ``life'':
</P>
<P>
   ``GET REAL NO PERSON IN THEIR RIGHT MIND IS GOING TO MAKE A
HAPPY DAY IF THEY DO THEY SHOULD BE SENT TO WORK IN A REAL JOB,
WHERE EVERYTHING DOESN'T GO THE WAY YOU WANT IT TO. HAPPY DAY IS
THE STUPIDEST IDEA EVER.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, you're much more likely to find subject lines that
say things like, ``I LOVE KITTY CATS!!!!!!!'' But the vehemence of
the posting is noteworthy, even in the frequently overheated medium
of of Web message boards.
</P>
<P>
   The real trouble began around last Thanksgiving, when Johnson
went to war in the name of happiness against no less than Landers.
The advice columnist ran a reader's letter (followed by her own
supportive response) begging friends and family to spare them their
``ghastly'' holiday letters about how happy and well they were.
Johnson fired off a response and courted print and broadcast
coverage of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   In March, aiming to spread the word about her proposed happy
day, Johnson went on the ABC chat show ``Politically Incorrect,''
only to get a verbal thumping from comedian Lewis and guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Maher and the guests were pretty much vicious,'' said
John Propst, a card-carrying happy person from Early, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   From there, things got more and more surreal. Johnson's efforts
to get each of the nation's governors to endorse happiness as a
lifestyle choice produced mixed results. Eighteen have issued
official proclamations. New York Gov. George Pataki has no official
position on happiness, Johnson gleefully reported.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, on the other hand, came out swinging
for happiness. In his official proclamation, Bush notes everything
from the state's ``robust and dynamic economy'' (for which he can
implicitly take credit) to Lance Armstrong's win in the Tour de
France (in which his contribution was more vague) as reasons for
Texans to be happy. ``I urge all Texans to acknowledge the effects
of positive communications and to talk about the happy events and
moments in their lives,'' Bush wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps getting ahead of himself just a bit, Bush proclaimed
Sunday ``National Admit You Are Happy'' day.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spoilsport brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, declined to
issue a similar proclamation, but he may be less happy since his
wife, Columba, was caught for not declaring $19,000 worth of
Parisian loot to U.S. Customs recently.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reasons for playing along or not, the way Johnson sees
it, the Zeitgeist has made it politically correct to have wounds
and plain rude to be happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't meant to be this big emotional debate, like the
governors not knowing if they should sign the proclamation or
not,'' she said. ``I couldn't have scripted that; I couldn't have
scripted the funny things that have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny things like being accused of being a front for Jerry
Falwell or his like. Yes, there is a spiritual element to some of
the message board's postings, but Johnson says members range from
Christian to Wiccan.
</P>
<P>
   As for being a tool of the greeting card industry: ``Hallmark
won't even talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   About 800 happy soldiers have joined the cause, waging a
grass-roots happy revolution. The Web site has had more than
140,000 hits, and Johnson feels as though she's done at least that
many interviews.
</P>
<P>
   She is tired. Tired, but happy.
</P>
<P>
   And she has interviews beginning at 7 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, happy day.

 &HT;    Conference aims to educate `polio people' on overcoming health
challenges
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When she started falling down unexpectedly as an
adult, Shirlee Sussman wrote it off to the unsteady way she walked
on the side of her foot. She had, after all, come down with polio
when she was 2. Her left leg never grew to the size of her right
leg, and she always limped.
</P>
<P>
   She had no idea that polio, tragic enough when the virus
strikes, often comes back to cripple its victims again later in
life. Neither did the doctors she saw in the 1960s and '70s, even
as her pain level gradually grew and her fatigue threshold
gradually fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to the doctor and they tell you, 'There's no reason for
you to be falling. Maybe you need to go see a psychiatrist,' ''
Sussman says. ``That's very prevalent in the post-polio community,
being told you're a nut case.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery was unraveled in the early 1980s by Dr. Lauro
Halstead, himself a polio survivor whose coordination seemed to be
deteriorating. ``I thought of myself as cured,'' Halstead said, but
his research showed the experiences of polio people 30 to 40 years
after their infection was neither imaginary nor coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   Halstead coined the term post-polio syndrome, characterized by
progressive muscle weakness, debilitating fatigue and pain,
especially in joints and muscles. To Sussman, her diagnosis at 49
was a relief, finally explaining all those symptoms and identifying
her new challenge to overcome. But even now, she says, many people
who've had polio still don't understand what's happening to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary purpose of this conference is to educate them,
teach them exactly what did happen when they got polio,'' says
Sussman, now 65 and chairwoman of the Ohio Polio Network's biannual
post-polio conference Aug. 21 in Dayton. The conference is for
anyone who has had polio, whether or not they have been diagnosed
with post-polio syndrome, and their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers will talk about the syndrome, aging, exercise, massage
and anger management. ``There's a lot of anger involved,'' Sussman
says, ``because there's grief any time you have to give up
something, whether it's a loved one or part of your being.'' There
also is a lot of denial, she says, recalling many calls ``from
people who really don't want to admit that this is in fact what's
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Polio people are an unusually driven population, says
Halstead, who directs the post-polio program at the National
Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington. His data shows they average
more education than the general population, marry and raise
families at the same rate and have an employment rate four times
greater than that of other disabled people. Generally reluctant to
admit any weakness, they call themselves simply ``polio people'' or
``polios'' instead of using the word victim or survivor.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Most of us overused our muscles and kind of pretended we
never had any limitations,'' Sussman says. ``We were so determined
to be just like everybody else, to our detriment later on.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The cause of post-polio syndrome is not known for sure, but
the accepted theory is that people overcoming paralytic polio
simply wear themselves out in compensating for their disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sussman, for example, was paralyzed below the waist, but after
she reached her maximum recovery at the age of 8, she thought
nothing of walking the mile and a half each way to school with all
her friends. But however robust she acted, polio had destroyed many
of her motor neurons, and the remaining ones had to work much
harder to operate her muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neighboring nerve cells that took over for those killed by
the virus are now wearing out,'' says Dr. Jane Wootton, who directs
a nationally renowned polio clinic in Richmond, Va., and will speak
at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Sussman compares the pain with that of an amputee who still
feels the limb he has lost, because polio has killed the nerves
where she is hurting. ``My hips are always in pain,'' she says, as
are her shoulders and neck and the muscles that control both her
feet and ankles, from below the knee on down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned to pace myself. That is super-important,'' says
Sussman, who still runs her business brokering materials for paper
manufacturers from home with her husband. ``If you do too much
today, for the next three or four days you're going to pay for it
dearly because you'll have more pain and be so tired.''
</P>
<P>
   There's little treatment for PPS besides rest and light
exercise, although Wootton says symptoms can be eased by a variety
of professionals including therapists, orthotists, counselors,
nutritionists and clergy. Many post-polios diagnose themselves, but
Sussman says it's important to get a physician's diagnosis in order
to establish the patient's need for exercise and other help.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is there are so few doctors with dedicated polio
specialties. She knows of none in the Dayton area but one in
Cincinnati. Without that specialty, she says, ``There's really a
lack of understanding and knowledge of what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Sussman could never run and play with other kids and was sad
that she couldn't wear high heels, but she learned to dance and
could excel with the best of them in academics and music.
Successful in business, the Northmont Rotarian became the first
woman to lead the Ohio Chamber of Commerce's small business
council. ``Whenever I talk to anybody I went to high school with,
they say, `We just didn't notice.' ''
</P>
<P>
   People with polio learned it had to be that way. It's never been
easy for the disabled to fit in, and polio in particular was a
national nightmare until the Sabin and Salk vaccines in 1955 and
1961 all but ended it in this country. It struck 50,000 Americans
in 1952 alone, killing nearly one in eight, and estimates range
from 640,000 to 1.6 million living Americans who have had polio.
Between 40 percent and 75 percent of them develop PPS, which is
more than 250,000 at the low end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made me very different than my three brothers,'' Sussman
says. ``Much more accepting of the things in my life, and I don't
take them as obstacles. They're challenges to be overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason polio people have higher rates of high blood
pressure, for example, is even just walking is stressful. Sussman
wasn't aware until a post-polio doctor pointed it out that she
always clenched her fist when she walked. ``It takes total
concentration,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She can't walk for long anymore, but she uses a scooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes me as mobile as anybody else,'' Sussman says. ``I'm
still more active than many of my friends the same age who never
had polio.''

 &HT;    Always warm up car before emissions test
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's time I answered some of your letters, which have
been accumulating over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   First, I receive many requests for copies of past articles, many
of them accompanied by stamped, self-addressed envelopes. I'm not
ignoring you.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, when I want to read my column, I have to buy
a Friday paper just like everyone else. I don't have a copy machine
or fax, thus I have no way to forward the published columns myself.
However, the AJC provides this service to readers for a nominal
fee. Please call 404-526-5668 and save your stamps.
</P>
<P>
   On to the mailbag:
</P>
<P>
   John Schiereck and Mary Sherman e-mailed questions and comments
pertaining to emissions tests.
</P>
<P>
   John writes, ``I have a 1987 Buick that failed the emissions
test. COCarbon monoxide was twice the acceptable level. I always
use 93 octane fuel because the poor old girl knocks and pings with
anything less. Anyway, I put about $2 of cheap gas (87 octane) in
an empty tank and had it retested. She passes with flying colors.
The carbon monoxide was one-tenth of the acceptable level. Can you
explain why?''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Sherman writes, ``You failed to mention that if the engine
is cold, it will fail the emission test no matter the age or
condition of the car. You should have advised: Drive the car for 30
or more minutes and have it retested before you spend another dime
on a book or mechanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary is absolutely right. As I've advised in several previous
emissions columns, your vehicle should be driven, preferably at
highway speed, before getting in the test lane. This ensures that
the vehicle's engine computer _ assuming the rest of the system is
working correctly _ has had ample time to take control of things.
</P>
<P>
   A cold engine, especially with older vehicles, is a prime
candidate for a carbon monoxide failure. This could be the reason
for John's first failure.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect this more than the change in fuel octane. That alone
would not have resulted in such a major improvement in exhaust gas
readings.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Junius writes: ``My '85 S10 pickup's wipers will not park
when turned off. It is a regular two-speed wiper. Is the problem in
the wiper motor itself, or is there another part that parks the
wipers?''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the truck has not been recently painted, and the
ground circuit for the wipers has not been disturbed, the parking
circuit for the windshield wipers is contained in the cover, which
is part of the motor assembly but not part of the actual motor
itself. (Some parts stores sell only the motor assembly with the
cover as a unit, and some sell the cover with the circuit board
separately.)
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tod Rieger writes: ``Thanks for the recommendation to
retrofit an air-conditioning system only when the situation is
extreme. I have a 1985 system that hasn't had any R-12 added since
1993, and it seems to need some more. If that is all it needs, I'll
skip the retrofit. You also mentioned `other refrigerants.' Is
FR-12 one of those?''
</P>
<P>
   I would strongly recommend steering clear of any refrigerants
other than R-12 and R134A.
</P>
<P>
   Although the other refrigerants, FR-12 included, may perform
well when the air-conditioning system is retrofitted to use them,
it could prove to be a nightmare should you need service down the
road. FR-12 is a blend refrigerant and cannot be recycled. Most
shops are not equipped to service these systems and dispose of the
refrigerant.

   HAPPY _ AUSTIN, Texas _ During the past year of abuse, derision
and mockery, Pam Johnson has heard it all: That she's an agent of
the religious right or, worse, Hallmark cards. That's she's
delusional, or starting a cult. Ann Landers and comedian Richard
Lewis, who would seem to have nothing whatsoever in common, have in
Johnson a shared enemy. All this happened because a year ago Sunday
_ on 8/8/98 _ Pam Johnson of suburban Dallas came out of the
happiness closet after 33 years. No more fear, no more denial, no
more secrets. She proclaimed herself aggressively, unapologetically
happy and hoped you were the same. And if you were, she hoped you
would talk about it, that you would not keep your happiness under a
basket. She started the Secret Society of Happy People, mounted a
campaign to declare Aug. 8 National Admit You're Happy Day and soon
found herself the most despised woman in America. (Beach, Austin

   MEETING-OF-MINDS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Here they are, sitting in

looking like they don't belong. Not in Austin. Not at the Tavern.
They are three of the greatest writing minds chronicling the new
technology age, trusted arbiters privy to the inner workings of
that mystical place where all things are ``point and click'':
Silicon Valley. And you can ask them anything, so you ask them
about the future because that's why they're here. These three
soothsayers, these oracles, are here huddled over a basket of chips
to unravel it for you. Rather, they are here _ a half-mile from the
bookstore where they would, an hour later, shamelessly hawk their
respective books to the bright-eyed geeks of Austin _ to unravel
the Internet. Because the Internet, in all its gnarled knottedness,
IS the future. The Internet is what we will eventually and, in
totality, live on, love on, work on and relax on. They are here to
explain how the Internet will be everything. But first, you should
meet them. (Kallenberg, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

some homeowners running to the comfort of a gallon of white latex.
Fear of faux _ that broad category of paint and textural finishes,
from sponging to ragging to trompe l'oeil _ may discourage many
from experimenting with a look that is timeless and original, but
Bobby Sikes, Atlanta artist and muralist, explains the recent
trends in faux finishes and how they have moved away from the bold
colors of the '80s to the tone-on-tone neutrals of the '90s.

found herself the most despised woman in America. (Beach, Austin

   MEETING-OF-MINDS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Here they are, sitting in
front of you, tucked into a corner at The Tavern _ a bar with
televisions, cheap nachos and frosty mugs of beer _ and they're
looking like they don't belong. Not in Austin. Not at the Tavern.
They are three of the greatest writing minds chronicling the new
technology age, trusted arbiters privy to the inner workings of
that mystical place where all things are ``point and click'':
Silicon Valley. And you can ask them anything, so you ask them
about the future because that's why they're here. These three
soothsayers, these oracles, are here huddled over a basket of chips
to unravel it for you. Rather, they are here _ a half-mile from the
bookstore where they would, an hour later, shamelessly hawk their
respective books to the bright-eyed geeks of Austin _ to unravel
the Internet. Because the Internet, in all its gnarled knottedness,
IS the future. The Internet is what we will eventually and, in
totality, live on, love on, work on and relax on. They are here to
explain how the Internet will be everything. But first, you should
meet them. (Kallenberg, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

   FAUX-FINISH _ The thought of selecting one decorative wall
finish from the array of options these days can be enough to send
some homeowners running to the comfort of a gallon of white latex.
Fear of faux _ that broad category of paint and textural finishes,
from sponging to ragging to trompe l'oeil _ may discourage many
from experimenting with a look that is timeless and original, but
Bobby Sikes, Atlanta artist and muralist, explains the recent
trends in faux finishes and how they have moved away from the bold
colors of the '80s to the tone-on-tone neutrals of the '90s.

 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Here they are, sitting in front of you, tucked
into a corner at The Tavern _ a bar with televisions, cheap nachos
and frosty mugs of beer _ and they're looking like they don't
belong. Not in Austin. Not at the Tavern.
</P>
<P>
   They are three of the greatest writing minds chronicling the new
technology age, trusted arbiters privy to the inner workings of
that mystical place where all things are ``point and click'':
Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   And you can ask them anything, so you ask them about the future
because that's why they're here. These three soothsayers, these
oracles, are here huddled over a basket of chips to unravel it for
you. Rather, they are here _ a half-mile from the bookstore where
they would, an hour later, shamelessly hawk their respective books
to the bright-eyed geeks of Austin _ to unravel the Internet.
Because the Internet, in all its gnarled knottedness, IS the
future. The Internet is what we will eventually and, in totality,
live on, love on, work on and relax on. They are here to explain
how the Internet will be everything. Everything.
</P>
<P>
   But first, you should meet them.
</P>
<P>
   Over there, on the cell phone (again), is Kara Swisher. She
writes for the Wall Street Journal, was named ``most influential
writer on the Internet economy'' by the Industry Standard magazine,
and is the author of ``AOL.com.'' She wears sunglasses indoors like
a rock star because, to the tech world, she is one. Munching on the
limp salad and sipping the Sprite is the bespectacled Gary Rivlin.
He is the award-winning author of ``The Plot to Get Bill Gates''
and is the Cassandra who sees the negative side of technology. Then
there's Po Bronson, uber-journalist and author of ``The Nudist on
the Late Shift.'' He is so on the cutting edge, he even looks
futuristic, with a ``Logan's Run'' angulation of the jaw and alien
blue eyes.
</P>
<P>
   So they're all here, and they are all qualified. Overqualified.
Because even if they're wrong about the future, they will be right.
These three are so mighty with the pen that what they write, what
they say, manifests itself as truth. You can trust them. And you
ask: (ital) What will be? (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   They are just starting to untangle your query when the skeptic
appears. The waiter, the one with the backward baseball cap and the
scraggly goatee, the one who brings the tortilla chips and the
Shiner for Bronson, questions that the Internet is the future. His
future is colonies in space and total Y2K-inspired pandemonium. The
waiter sees an end to the overnight millionaire and an end to the
over-hyped medium we call the Internet. He says the boom time is
over. It can't go on. He knows, the waiter explains, because he's a
business major.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't know. He isn't the one who can see the future. He
isn't Kara Swisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should it end?'' snaps Swisher. (Swisher snaps a lot.)
``Why should this end? People talk about the Internet being on a
precipice, the Internet being overvalued, but what's overvalued? Is
real estate in California overvalued? What if buying Yahoo! is like
buying ABC in 1940? Then, you would definitely say it was worth it.
Right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about the Internet and the economy driving it
is that everyone will have the opportunity to be successful,''
Bronson says, stopping to sip his beer. ``Think about it. You have
a better chance of starting an Internet company and being
successful than starting a television network or even writing a
teleplay and getting it produced.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronson knows. He has seen the Internet successes up close. It's
what his book is about. His world is filled with the dreamers who
are shaping an electronic place that our virtual selves will
eventually live in.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us see the Internet through the filters of the press and
through the eyes of Hollywood. He has broken through those filters
and sees a future we can barely comprehend. Our Internet has Sandra
Bullock chasing the evil Jeremy Northam through a Web of E-commerce
sites. Bronson's Internet is a place where we can live in digital
harmony, work anywhere we wish and all exist in a common electronic
space.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, he spends time with the people who are building
this space. He is well-acquainted with the architects of the
future. Bronson knows the New World is coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this new opportunity isn't all good,'' the man from
``Logan's Run'' continues. ``No matter how successful you are in
the Internet, you will still feel the brunt of competition against
your fellow humans. Moderation and being able to downshift will be
prized commodities, and the people who figure out how to do the
downshifting will be celebrated. But it's fantastic. Despite the
Internet's high social cost, it allows opportunity for everyone,
the possibility of financial success for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, the future and the Internet scare me,'' chimes in
Rivlin as he plays with his salad. ``I see lots of interesting
businesses, lots of people making money. Then again, there are a
lot of people not making money. I also see a widening gap between
the digital haves and the have-nots. This new age is going to leave
a lot of people behind. I also feel this linking of people through
computers is going to cut us off from our history. The Internet is
not good for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivlin's future, his Internet, is a world where people are
detached from one another. For him, there will be no common space.
Because we will have less actual contact with other humans, we will
separate ourselves from our pasts and each other. Rivlin cites a
Carnegie-Mellon study of Internet use. The study concluded that the
more time you spend on the Internet, the more lonely and depressed
you are.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, oracles don't agree. And Swisher doesn't. She is
upset at this notion of detachment. In her writing, she has seen
the joining together of people up close. She has seen the good the
Internet can do. Her book, ``AOL.com,'' shows how America Online
started as a way for people to talk dirty to each other and became
a global communications device to exchange ideas, opinions and meet
really neat people. After witnessing the birth of an Internet
company from nothing, and seeing its growth into a communications
giant and NASDAQ star, how can you be anything but excited about
the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability for the Internet to change people's lives is
vast,'' states Swisher. ``Everyone in the world can and will have
access to it. It's a giant idea. Think about it, just the ability
to reach everyone in the world is very powerful. What you can do
with the Internet, you can't do with any other medium. And its
power will only grow.''
</P>
<P>
   This leads Bronson to think about the kids. He wonders aloud
what the generation of children will be like who grow up thinking
there was never a time when there wasn't an Internet. He takes a
another sip from his Shiner and states his affection for the native
brew.
</P>
<P>
   He half-jokes about how parents and kids won't see eye-to-eye on
the Internet. How we, as parents, will recount how things used to
be different before the Net. We'll tell our children how we used to
go outside to play and, to contact friends, we used to actually
call them on the phone. For entertainment, we mindlessly (and
noninteractively) watched television for hours and hours. Our kids
will laugh and call us relics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have an Internet generation where it's all
about sitting and staring instead of going out to play,'' states
Rivlin defensively. (By now, he knows it is only a matter of time
before Swisher will respond.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have an impact,'' Rivlin continues. ``These kids will
grow up not knowing the reality that existed before the Internet
and, therefore, will have no problem entrenching themselves on
their computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivlin's views aren't unfounded. He has spent years examining
the darker side of the technology age. He has seen the greed, the
ulterior motives and the Genghis Khan mentality of Bill Gates and
his rivals. These technology leaders, and those who aspire to be
them, aren't all in it for the charity. They're not in business to
build a global village and make our world a better place. They're
in it for the money and the power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is much more creative than television ever could
be,'' Swisher immediately volleys back. ``At least the Internet is
interactive. It's not just sitting and watching Pokemon do some
weird-ass thing. Besides, when was it that everyone went out and
played? I watched television.''
</P>
<P>
   The future that began as one vision has mysteriously divided
itself into three separate futures _ Bronson's is dreamy and Ray
Bradbury-ish, Swisher's is polished, flawless and Utopian, and,
Rivlin's is dark and exclusionary _ as the tortilla chips are
swapped out once, Rivlin's salad is taken away and Bronson finishes
his beer.
</P>
<P>
   Swisher looks at her watch and decides it is time for all three
to go. She wants to buy a book for beach reading before her
signing. After tonight, Swisher explains, she is off to Mexico to
sun herself at some tropical, totally solar-powered, resort. She
boasts how she found her vacation spot on the Internet. Rivlin and
Bronson, much more concerned about the here and now, wonder if any
good bands are playing nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Talk sways back to the matter at hand one final time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world will demand that the Internet gets easier,'' says
Rivlin as the bill is delivered by a still unconvinced waiter.
``The future will be an Internet like a telephone. When you're on,
you're on. Unfortunately, the Internet of the future is an Internet
where there won't be a choice. If you want to make it financially
or succeed career-wise, you'll have to learn it. There will be no
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like saying in the future, it will be discriminatory
not hiring a field goal kicker who never kicked field goals,''
jokes Bronson. ``Of course, you'll have to learn it.''
</P>
<P>
   True to form, Swisher commands the last word.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, you had monks doing inscriptions and only a few people
see them,'' she says before dialing up her messages on the cell
phone. ``Then you have the printing press. A few more people are
reached. Next you have the radio, the telephone and television and
even more people get reached. The Internet takes it that much
further. How can this be anything but wonderful? The more people
who have access to the Internet, the better the world will be. And
how can an Internet that will eventually reach everyone be a bad
thing?''

   Paradoxically, as everybody knows here, a career is often made
in Russia by those who do nothing to make it. For instance, it is
known for certain that Yevgeny M. Primakov, our second-to-the-last
prime minister, had never wanted the post. In 1996, when spoken to
about running in the national elections, he flatly refused.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was precisely his several months of premiership, at the
forceful behest of Yeltsin, that led Russia to trust him. Or maybe
it was Primakov's special talent to lull Russia into a sense of
security?
</P>
<P>
   Oh well, that's history. We've been through three prime
ministers in the last year and a half _ and now the fourth. We've
seen the firing of Primakov, the ascendancy of Sergei V. Stepashin,
and now, three months later, yet a new move on the chess board. It
must have come as a nasty surprise to Stepashin, 47, who has been
loyal to Yeltsin _ the news was only announced to him in the
Kremlin very early in the morning on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Let this be said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's next president will take over a free but semi-bankrupt
state, overburdened by its social obligations to the people. This
is a constant. Yeltsin cannot wave away the problems on the streets
of Moscow and St. Petersburg as he can wave his hand and make a
prime minister _ or even a whole State Duma _ disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the buzzing in the Kremlin halls had already begun.
Those insiders were saying that a decision was about to be made as
to which would be better _ to start yet another difficult and
perilous move to remove the prime minister, who was being seen as
weak, or to call an all-Russia referendum simultaneously with
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose? A rescue operation to keep Yeltsin in control of
the next presidential race. A mission to control who succeeds him.
A major effort to keep a Yeltsin-backed candidate from being
trounced by the strengthening opposition force, which is an
alliance of several regional leaders, now led by Primakov and
Moscow Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve this ``rescue,'' a tough scenario was already
emerging behind the scenes. It was being presumed that the post of
head of government would be offered to someone outside the Russian
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Although this new Monday massacre is a shock in the West, for
several weeks now in Russia, the media have been citing the name of
a rising candidate: Vladimir V. Putin, 46, the man who last week
was director of the domestic security service (FSB), an arm of the
Cold War-era KGB, and secretary of the president's Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, this is a reverse. Since Primakov was abruptly
dismissed three months ago, top Kremlin officials have been saying
all but openly that Stepashin was destined to become Yeltsin's
successor.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to our sources, Naina Yeltsin, the president's
wife, and Pavel Borodin, the influential head of the presidential
Property Management Administration, were actively trying to
persuade Yeltsin to choose Putin. Their arguments: Putin is more
decisive than Stepashin and, moreover, as a former deputy Kremlin
administrator in charge of relations with Russia's regional
governments, Putin enjoys the support of the very power structure
now lining up in support of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the sack-Stepashin, elevate-Putin scenario is that
Yeltsin will dissolve the Duma, if in fact, it takes the requisite
three votes and turns Putin down every time. The members may well
vote no _ out of obstinacy, rebellion against Yeltsin, frustration
at the line of prime ministers or just because they don't like
Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Should Putin fail three times, Yeltsin might very well resign,
leaving Putin, appointed by his decree, constitutionally the legal
acting president. Thus, despite the Duma, Putin would have what
Yeltsin really wants for him: an excellent jumping-off ground for
the July 2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   This scenario, however, could well be little more than a
``Kremlin horror story'' designed to strike terror into the Kremlin
opponents. Then again, as the world is now aware, step one _ the
sacking of Stepashin _ has already occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Russia, the Communists, led by Gennadi Zyuganov, who
would favor the Primakov option, are already shaking in their
boots. Party members were seriously assuring your correspondent
last week that the Moscow police already had held an exercise in
the outlying suburb of Mitino, in full riot gear, ready for the
worst, a public rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus also
apparently promised Yeltsin to send in his own republic's police
force, should violence erupt, because at this point the Moscow
police are find of Luzhkov, the populist mayor.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kremlin is indeed considering a scenario based on the use
of force, it would only be as a kind of last resort exotica. No
doubt, Yeltsin is pinning far greater hopes on a peaceful shift,
hoping that the Russian people will, once again, remain stalwart
and passive.
</P>
<P>
   Either a forceful or a peaceful option would have the same
objective, however: to get a man such as Putin in, and in a
position strong enough to defeat a Primakov-Luzhkov ticket.

   MOSCOW _ Once again Boris Yeltsin has played a difficult and
dangerous game _ sacking our country's prime minister. And now our
best analytical minds are considering what to do.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   In six months, Russia is supposed to begin full-scale
destruction of its chemical weapons, according to the Treaty on the
Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of
Chemical Weapons and Their Destruction. The State Duma ratified it
in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, however, the members passed a resolution saying
that the country lacked the conditions for safe destruction of
chemical weapons. Today in Russia it is far more dangerous to
destroy than to store chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   True, it is extremely dangerous to store chemical weapons,
especially in densely populated areas, which is where the majority
of our arsenals are located.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the year before last, forest fires very nearly
reached a major site of chemical-weapon storage facilities _ that
was a close shave; it's a miracle we were spared. Yet we must get
rid of this hazard in a proper way, without further endangering
people's life and health.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary, conservative estimates, the
chemical-weapons destruction program costs 32 billion rubles (about
$1.3 billion). From year to year, however, the program has been
badly underfunded. For instance, the 1999 budget provides for a
mere 5.4 percent of the necessary expenditure.
</P>
<P>
   We have already done untold harm by producing huge stockpiles of
chemical weapons, storing them carelessly and hastily getting rid
of them. According to the Russian State Committee for the
Environment and Natural Resources, in the Penza region, near the
railroad station of Leonidovka, soil samples were taken in areas of
presumed post-war destruction of chemical ammunition. Tests showed
that the arsenic concentration was 100 to 78,000 times higher than
the permissible level! Bottom sediments in a water spring of the
Zhdanka stream (barely a mile away from the weapons destruction
site) had a concentration of arsenic between three and 45 times the
safety level; chromium, four to 10 times; and lead, 1.4 to 3.4
times.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bezymyanny stream, which is very close to the Surskoye
water reservoir that supplies drinking water to the 600,000 &QC; strong
population of Penza and the town of Zarechny, the
arsenic concentration is eight times the safety level and chromium,
2.9 times.
</P>
<P>
   Or take Lake Mokhovoye _ local residents call it a ``dead
lake'': There is absolutely no vegetation there with all trees on
the banks long dead. The lake was used for underwater explosive
demolition of toxic chemical air bombs. Today the lake bed
sediments have a concentration of arsenic 2 to 7 times the maximum
permissible level.
</P>
<P>
   The military say that these horrendous statistics must not be
disclosed lest they cause panic. But we have to disclose them _
first, in order to start a clean-up of the contaminated areas
without delay; second, so that everyone realizes how dangerous the
irresponsible destruction of chemical weapons can be.
</P>
<P>
   We have yet to adopt laws regulating the storage, transportation
and disposal of chemical weapons and reimbursement of damage in the
event of accidents at weapons storage and disposal facilities, laws
ensuring industrial and environmental safety and social protection
of citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Why has the State Duma, which unanimously voted in favor of
ratifying the treaty, not passed the necessary laws? Because
implementation of these laws requires money, which the treasury
does not have.
</P>
<P>
   When in 1997, the Duma adopted the law on the destruction of
chemical weapons, I insisted that it provide for at least the basic
social guarantees for those engaged in the destruction process.
Indeed, given our financial situation, it was unrealistic to expect
voluntary provision of the means to ensure social protection.
</P>
<P>
   But the deputies succumbed to pressure from the military, which
was claiming that unless the treaty was ratified, Russia's
international prestige would suffer and economic sanctions would be
slapped on us. If, however, it was ratified, the international
community would pick up much of the tab for the destruction of our
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, foreign aid covers only 5 percent or 6 percent of
this cost while failure to implement a ratified treaty entails far
more serious hazards. We were simply dragged into a dangerous and
costly venture.
</P>
<P>
   There was absolutely no need for us to emulate the United
States. There it was indeed a matter of great urgency to destroy
old stockpiles of chemical weapons because of leaky tanks. Our
tanks, however, are perfectly all right, what with Soviet industry
having been the most metal-intensive in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Congress, unlike our parliament, held months-long
debates before ratifying this treaty. We are worlds apart from
America in the economic, technological and legal means of ensuring
the safe implementation of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   If people who actually destroy chemical weapons are not
guaranteed security and social protection, who will want to do this
job?
</P>
<P>
   It would, of course, be best if the country's chemical weapons
were destroyed by those who once manufactured them. They have
special knowledge and experience in handling toxic agents. But the
majority of our chemical enterprises have been privatized by now
and do not take orders from the state.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, a ``very simple solution'' has been found: Let the
weapons be destroyed by those who store them. That is to say, by
the military. If it is the military, everything will be done in
secrecy, outside the scrutiny of the public. But for sure, with
this, you can forget about social protection and environmental
safety oversight.
</P>
<P>
   We will see inexperienced youngsters put out in the field at
minimal pay to do a highly dangerous job in a rush. They are bound
to get poisoned. They will not only become cripples themselves but
will also bear sick children. Then we'll be tearing at our hair but
it will be too late. We will have tens of thousands of new cripples
in addition to those who handled the cleanup of the Chernobyl
nuclear accident. And tens of thousands of sick children.
</P>
<P>
   And what is to be done now? For a start, set up an
interdepartmental commission that would appraise the existing
economic, technological and legal base to ensure the implementation
of the treaty together with environmentalists and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   If the commission confirms that Russia is indeed not ready for
the safe destruction of chemical weapons, we must then invoke those
articles of the treaty allowing for the unilateral suspension of
this document.

it will be too late. We will have tens of thousands of new cripples
in addition to those who handled the cleanup of the Chernobyl
nuclear accident. And tens of thousands of sick children.
</P>
<P>
   And what is to be done now? For a start, set up an
interdepartmental commission that would appraise the existing
economic, technological and legal base to ensure the implementation
of the treaty together with environmentalists and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   If the commission confirms that Russia is indeed not ready for
the safe destruction of chemical weapons, we must then invoke those
articles of the treaty allowing for the unilateral suspension of
this document.

   ARMY-HOSPITAL (Albany, N.Y.) _ First Sgt. Frances Phelan took a
red-eye flight from Seattle to make it to Sunday's 364th Army
Reserve Field Hospital Inactivation Ceremony here. ``I wouldn't
have missed this for the world,'' said Phelan, who now is a ROTC

   LOSING-WEIGHT (Albany, N.Y.) _ After struggling to lose weight,
a colleague finally decided to consult a specialist. ``You know
what you need to do,'' he recalled the doctor saying. ``Eat less
and move more.'' If that sounds unbelievably simple, it is. But
it's also a strategy that works, and doesn't require any special
diet, supplement or gimmick. By SYLVIA WOOD.

<P>
   WELLS-CEO (San Francisco) _ Dick Kovacevich is busy piloting a
very big firm. Last year, the Stanford MBA and his former bank,
Norwest, bought San Francisco- based Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. for $32
billion in one of the last great bank mergers of the decade. By
EDWARD IWATA.
</P>
<P>
   SAIPAN-CLOTHES (San Francisco) _ Four retailers, including

</P>
<P>
   BALLPARK-TOURISTS (San Francisco) _ With the money Glenn
Brakefield of San Francisco, Linda Countryman of Kentucky and Ann
and George Elwood of New York have spent on vacations recently,
they could have gone to Paris for a week. Yet they have opted for
Detroit, Milwaukee and Cleveland. There are neither azure seas in
those cities nor the Arc de Triomphe. They do, however, have
ballparks. Increasing numbers of tourists are forfeiting more
glamorous summer vacations and choosing to visit ballparks around
the country. By MARSHA GINSBURG.
</P>
<P>
   RAC-ADDICTIONS (Saratoga Springs, N.Y.) _ A racecourse
backstretch can foster an unhealthy reliance on gambling, drugs or
alcohol, racing veterans say. ``The backstretch, for an addictive

   BOOK-REVIEW-MYSTERIES (Undated) _ The many fans of Jeffrey
Deaver's thrillers will be disappointed to learn that ``The Devil's
Teardrop'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25, 396 pages) does not feature the
brilliant quadriplegic criminalist Lincoln Rhyme (he does make a
cameo appearance). But that is the only disappointment that Deaver
serves. By BOBBIE HESS.

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ There's all sorts of talk about
global warming and changes in our climate. Yes, something might be
happening with our climate. After all, something has happened many
times in the past, and it's not illogical to presume that it could
happen again. But to presume, as so many people do, that a few hot
summers and mild winters constitute proof that it's definitely
happening doesn't make sense. By DAN LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ A series of killer earthquakes
that began in Assisi, Italy, on Sept. 26, 1997, damaged St.
Francis' basilica there. From that catastrophe, a wonderful
opportunity has been given to the citizens of and visitors to
Milan, Paris, New York and San Francisco. As part of a $60 million
restoration project, scores of surviving works of art and
reliquaries from the basilica are out of their damaged home and on
tour. By STEPHANIE SALTER.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-COCAINE (San Francisco) _ As Texas Gov. George W. Bush
should know from his experience with alcohol, drug use is no game.
He has talked openly about how, at age 40, he realized booze was
taking a toll on his life and how he decided to stop drinking for
the good of himself and his family. Bush should be equally
forthcoming about what he did or didn't put up his nose during what
he has called his ``young and irresponsible'' years. By DARREN
RICHARDSON.
</P>
<P>
   HOOVER-BIRTHDAY (Danville, Calif.) _ Tuesday was the birthday of
one of the most popular presidents ever elected _ the tough-minded,
straight-shooting winner of what at the time was the biggest
landslide in American history. It is also the birthday of a
president who, by the end of his term, had become one of the
nation's least popular leaders and loser of the second most
one-sided presidential election. Happy birthday, Herbert Hoover. By
CYNTHIA BASS.
</P>
<P>
   HIDDEN-FEES (San Francisco) _ An amazing turn of events has
occurred since the last time I made a major purchase. Stores, which
formerly raised prices to make up for customers who steal from
them, have apparently decided to eliminate the middleman and now
are stealing directly from you. By RUTH SHERMAN.

   Although Moscow's latest Monday massacre _ the firing of Prime

that Stepashin was destined to become Yeltsin's successor. But
Naina Yeltsin, the president's wife, among others, has been
actively trying to persuade Yeltsin to choose Putin. Yevgeny

   In six months, Russia is supposed to begin full-scale
destruction of its chemical weapons, according to the Treaty on the
Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of
Chemical Weapons and Their Destruction. But there is no money in
the treasury to do so. It was claimed that without the treaty,
Russia's international prestige would suffer and economic sanctions
would be slapped on us. If, however, it was ratified, supposedly
the international community would pick up much of the tab for the

HOUSTON BUS DRIVER IN TUNE WITH AIRPORT-GOERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LISA DAVIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Travelers fortunate enough to hitch a ride with
airport shuttle driver Ellen Trevathan are having their lucky day,
and she won't hesitate to tell them, either.
</P>
<P>
   Trevathan, known to passengers as The Singing Bus Lady,
entertains passengers from the City Economy Lot to Bush
Intercontinental Airport singing country songs for cowboys, gospel
songs for preachers, gambling songs for gamblers and love songs for
honeymooners.
</P>
<P>
   ``My singing can make this the longest or the shortest trip in
your life,'' Trevathan tells a van load of passengers. ``But a
girl's got to do what a girl's got to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Her program begins with the jingle ``City Economy Lot is the
place for you,'' which is an advertiser's dream. Trevathan, 52,
continues with throaty renditions of Hank Williams' ``I Saw the
Light,'' Kenny Rogers' ``The Gambler'' and then ``Faded Love,''
which she introduces as ``an old Patsy Cline tune, or a new tune
from Monica Lewinsky to the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Trevathan admits that not every rider is a fan, but the extra
$50 in tips each week, and the ovations, are signs that many enjoy
their five-minute shuttle, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just like the idea that someone's paying attention to
them after a long trip,'' said Steve Howard, vice president of
All-Right Parking, which operates the shuttle buses for the City
Economy Lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have the elevator syndrome when they get on a bus, and
she's certainly the opposite of that. She's just not going to let
that happen,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harmond, a businessman from nearby Katy who rode with
Trevathan recently, said, ``If my wife were here, she'd probably
want to go around for another trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Traylor, a parking monitor for the City Economy Lot, said
people who've ridden with Trevathan often ``ask when that Singing
Bus Lady will come by.'' But it's not always easy to find her among
the more than 20 buses serving the nearly 10,000 parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Trevathan of suburban Humble is pure Texas, complete with a
butterfly clip nestled in her gray bouffant. She greets everyone
who happens on her charter with a friendly ``Hi, Darlin'.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my job,'' she said. ``I get to look at all the handsome
men in Houston, fantasize about them for five minutes, and I don't
have to wash their socks in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do this until I retire or die, whichever comes
first.''
</P>
<P>
   She's been at the City Economy Lot for 10 months, but she's been
a driver for other All-Right Parking lots for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Trevathan was married to a preacher for the 16 years before
that, and she said she views her job and performing as her personal
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to meet people wherever they are at the time,'' she
said. ``A lot of people are frustrated or worried about the time
when they get on, but humor takes their mind off their anxieties
for a moment.''
</P>
<P>
   She also has been known to put the show on hold for a grieving
family or if someone's really belligerent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to play it cool and let them have a solemn ride,''
Trevathan said. ``I do know how to read people and shut up, even
though I'm an extrovert.''
</P>
<P>
   When traffic is light on her Monday-through-Friday 3 p.m. to 11
p.m. shift, she loves to have single passengers ride with her and
chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like being a bartender,'' Trevathan said.
``People tell me their troubles because they think they'll never
see me again.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she enjoys being a bucket-seat psychiatrist, Trevathan
does have some entertainment aspirations. She's never wanted to
make it to Nashville, Tenn., where singing bus drivers are
abundant, but she wouldn't mind an appearance on a late-night show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to take my jingle as far as it will take me,''
she said.

   PARTY _ In 1992, Ross Perot led an impassioned following of
angry, disaffected voters that caused fits for the campaigns of
President Bush and then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton. His independent
candidacy won almost 20 percent of the vote, the best showing for
an independent or third-party presidential candidate in more than
half a century. And it sparked a debate that continues today about
whether he might have sealed Bush's defeat, even though exit polls
show that he probably drew almost equally from Democrats and
Republicans. Flash forward to 2000. Could a third-party candidate
wield that kind of political clout again? 36. David Goldstein.

   COOK: Steven Cook had been dead so long that his body had begun
to stink. Another heat victim, authorities said, when his body was
discovered July 21 in his sweltering midtown apartment. But local
mental health officials say it was a needless death. They're
outraged because Cook was only 40, and no one had checked on him at
the Campbell Street group home where he lived. Bavley. Photo of

   DEUTSCHE (analysis) _ Deutsche Telekom keeps popping up as the
company most likely to buy Sprint. But could it pull off such a
deal? If so, that actually could be good for Kansas City, since
Deutsche is a global player without much U.S. business, so it
probably would let Sprint stay in Kansas City. Ted Sickinger

ARMY SLOWLY RETIRING FIELD HOSPITAL UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE FRICANO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ First Sgt. Frances Phelan took a red-eye flight
from Seattle to make it to the 364th Army Reserve Field Hospital
Inactivation Ceremony on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And all the fatigue and travails of predawn air travel were
worth it. As one of the first six women to serve with the
76-year-old Army outfit in Albany, she had to be present for the
retiring of the unit's flag and honoring of her extended family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have missed this for the world,'' said Phelan, who
now is a ROTC medical coordinator at Fort Lewis in Tacoma, Wash.
``This group stays together, because we do far more than bigger
units.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the 260 men and women of the 364th, dwindling
numbers have forced the Army to inactivate the unit, which operates
out of tents. According to public affairs officer Maj. Linda
Taylor, 16 Army hospitals are being inactivated during the next six
years, leaving 25 hospitals throughout the country. Almost all the
members of the 364th have been reassigned to the 348th General
Hospital, which is based in Pedricktown, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``The morale is somewhat sad ... we worked very hard under that
flag,'' Taylor said. ``But morale here is very good, because we're
a very close-knit, family-oriented unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Duane May, commander of the 8th Medical Brigade, of
which the 364th was a part spoke very highly of the unit, which has
provided medical assistance in every conflict since and including
World War II and more recently has been involved in humanitarian
endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't retire the character of the 364th,'' May said in his
speech to several hundred in the audience. He said that the unit
exemplified the army values of loyalty, duty and respect among
others. ``I love a unit that acts like soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   The unit's commanding officer, Col. James M. Veazey Jr., who was
honored with a commendation medal for his exceptional meritorious
service, could not help but boast about the people with whom he had
served for the past 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today even the heavens weep in recognition of the impact of
the 364th,'' Veazey said under cloudy skies that earlier in the day
had given way to showers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pleasure and a great privilege to be base commander
for the last four years,'' Veazey said. ``God bless you and
Godspeed.''
</P>
<P>
   After the formal ceremony, the soldiers and their families
gathered at the Army Reserve Training Center.
</P>
<P>
   When Phelan saw retired Col. Edmund Purdy, who had traveled from
Nova Scotia for the event, they compared travel distances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where'd you come fly from?'' Purdy asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tacoma,'' replied Phelan, who later added that she remembers
when Purdy was a major at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tacoma,'' Purdy said, ``Well, then you win (for distance).''
</P>
<P>
   Purdy, 76, was assigned to the 364th in 1964 as a dentist
specializing in prosthetics.
</P>
<P>
   Initially saddened when he learned of his former unit's fate,
Purdy was overjoyed when he learned of the unit's absorption into
the 348th.

THE BEST DIET BEGINS WITH SMALLER SERVINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ After struggling to lose weight, a colleague
finally decided to consult a specialist. ``You know what you need
to do,'' he recalled the doctor saying. ``Eat less and move more.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds unbelievably simple, it is.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also a strategy that works, and doesn't require any
special diet, supplement or gimmick. Over the past six months, my
co-worker has slimmed down almost three pant sizes by doing nothing
more than walking at little longer every day and keeping an eye on
the portions on his plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that with pasta, which was my favorite because it
was easy and fast, I was probably eating servings for three or
four,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   My colleague now takes a more measured approach, writing down
everything he eats and always leaving a restaurant with a doggy
bag. ``The portions are too big,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But portion control as a dieting strategy doesn't sell books or
make for catchy late-night infomercials, which may explain why
Americans continue getting fatter despite a billion-dollar
obsession with weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really become a nation of gluttons and we're not even
aware of it,'' said Karen Miller-Kovach, the lead scientist and
nutritionist at Weight Watchers. ``If you want to learn about
portion sizes, go on a European vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand how out of proportion we've become, think
supersize at McDonald's or all-you-can-eat at the country buffet.
Even bagels and muffins have gotten bigger, and many restaurants no
longer use plates, they use platters.
</P>
<P>
   For people who don't want to join Weight Watchers, there are
other strategies to help figure portion sizes.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, pay attention to the USDA Food Pyramid, and its
list of recommended servings. Remember, a serving size is a
standardized unit of measure and not a serving on your plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest areas of confusion I see with people is
serving size,'' Miller-Kovach said. ``It's not `whatever I eat at a
given time.''' So the six to 11 recommended servings of bread,
rice, cereal and pasta aren't as much as you think and probably
much less.
</P>
<P>
   Eat two slices of toast for breakfast and you've had two
servings. Have a sandwich for lunch, and your running total is now
four. Eat a cup of cooked pasta for dinner and you've gotten two
more (1/2 cup cooked pasta, cereal or rice equals one serving).
</P>
<P>
   ``When people start keeping track of what they're eating, they
often realize they're eating more than they thought,'' said Cindy
Moore, a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Foundation and
director of nutrition therapy at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Losing weight becomes a matter of cutting back on the total
amount of food. To lose a pound a week, you'll need to cut back on
500 calories a day, roughly the equivalent of 4 1/2 tablespoons of
oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is the total number of calories at the end of
the day,'' said Nan Windmueller, an Albany nutritionist. ``Nothing
needs to be eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   Windmueller counsels her patients to get most of their calories
from fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Not only are those foods
healthy, but they pack more bulk per calorie, which leaves you
feeling fuller and more satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   She also reminds them that portion control can leave room for
favorite foods, whether it's chocolate or ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people need is a strategy for eating, not for depriving
themselves,'' Windmueller said. ``I have a client who eats a Ring
Ding every afternoon. She has to and she's losing weight
beautifully.''

LET'S GO OUT TO THE BALLPARK (RATHER THAN PARIS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARSHA GINSBURG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With the money Glenn Brakefield of San
Francisco, Linda Countryman of Kentucky and Ann and George Elwood
of New York have spent on vacations recently, they could have gone
to Paris for a week, splurged on a condominium in Maui or taken a
cruise to the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they have opted for Detroit, Milwaukee and Cleveland. There
are neither azure seas in those cities nor the Arc de Triomphe.
They do, however, have ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing numbers of tourists are forfeiting more glamorous
summer vacations and choosing to visit ballparks around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   They are swinging through San Francisco this year to be part of
Candlestick Park's final season as the home of the San Francisco
Giants, and even more are likely in the coming years to see the
team's new downtown home, Pacific Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us cares anything about Hawaii,'' said Countryman, 50,
who visits different ballparks every year with her 76-year-old
mother and sister. Earlier this month, they toured Yankee Stadium
and the baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., to see the
induction ceremonies for pitcher Nolan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   The ballpark-tour boom has capitalized on the trend in major
league baseball to build new downtown stadiums with an
old-fashioned feel, popular since the opening of Oriole Park at
Camden Yards in Baltimore in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been to Europe, and I wouldn't go if someone paid
me,'' said A.G. Thomas of San Diego, a retired engineer who has
seen about 20 of the nation's 30 major league ballparks on nine
tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ride boats. I don't like to dance. This is what I
like. This is what I go for,'' said Brakefield, who has been on
five tours. ``I haven't found a stadium I didn't like. I haven't
found a hot dog I didn't like.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, fans say, these buildings are not the Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking stadiums with hot dogs as cuisine. Stadiums with
smelly bathrooms. Stadiums with home teams in the cellar, and
stadiums fans can't wait to see closed.
</P>
<P>
   But there are ballparks serving fresh strawberries and whipped
cream, ballparks steeped in history and spanking new ballparks with
retractable roofs.
</P>
<P>
   Tour operators _ such as Sports Travel Inc. of Hatfield, Mass.,
and Jay Buckley Tours of La Crosse, Wis. _ have seen business
double in the past two years alone say the ballpark boom may in
part grow out of a wave of nostalgia. Four ballparks close this
year: Tiger Stadium in Detroit, County Stadium in Milwaukee, the
Astrodome in Houston and Candlestick Park in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the history of it, I like to think about what it was
like back then,'' said Dan Wall, a 39-year-old Pittsburg
merchandiser who enjoyed his $3,000 tour to the Midwest so much he
uses his vacation time to be a host on many of the trips. ``The
guys on these trips can tell you the starting lineup of teams in
the 20s. But ask them who Dirty Harry is, and they'll say, `Who's
he?' They're watching baseball every minute of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to that a wave of new stadiums _ including Safeco Field,
which opened last month to replace the Kingdome in Seattle _ and
baseball lovers say there's plenty of reason to base a vacation on
ballpark visits.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when these 7,000 Americans consumed with America's
favorite pastime stadium-hop, trips can include long bus rides,
teams they don't normally root for, and nights in cities known more
for urban blight than beautiful landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Tour-goers pay separately to fly to the original destination and
to fly home from the last stop. The tour price does not include
meals or entertainment outside the ball games. Fans can spend up to
$3,000 for a trip.
</P>
<P>
   The tour price, which runs about $1,000, includes transportation
to and from the games, hotel accommodations and, of course,
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Fans say the trips include more than baseball. Often the games
are in cities like Chicago or New York, where fans say they enjoy
the jazz clubs, great restaurants and shopping. The oft-teased
Cleveland boasts the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Carrillo, a firefighter from Redwood City, Calif., said
Cleveland normally would not have been on his vacation wish list.
</P>
<P>
   But because Jacobs Field, built in 1994, was part of a stadium
package that included Tiger Stadium in Detroit and Oriole Park at
Camden Yards, he visited and discovered Cleveland was ``the most
fun of all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans are great,'' said Carrillo, 42, who is planning a
second stadium tour at the end of August. ``The area known as the
Flats on the water (near the stadium) is like a big party area. It
was packed.''
</P>
<P>
   These fans say a ballpark tour also is about Americana and
history.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who visit historic Wrigley Field in Chicago and Fenway Park
in Boston recall a time when major league baseball seemed like less
a business than a national pastime, and the places where players
stepped up to bat were in the middle of neighborhoods, instead of
the middle of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Stadium, which is getting more than its fair share of
visitors this year, is also a sentimental favorite. With Fenway
Park, which opened on the same day in 1912, Tiger Stadium is the
oldest ballpark in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very small and old, and you're sitting on top of the
field,'' Wall said. ``Ty Cobb was there, Hank Greenberg was there,
and a lot of Hall of Famers.''
</P>
<P>
   But he conceded that certain ballparks are ``destination
stadiums,'' a polite way of saying the ballpark is the point of the
trip, not the city.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, ``it's more like you run in, go to the game and get
the hell out of there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Few who take the trips don't consider the vacation expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You usually stay where the players stay,'' said Thomas, 65, of
San Diego, who has seen about 20 stadiums with Sports Travel Inc.
``They're better tickets than you could get walking up yourself.
You meet with the umpires and visit the city, too.''

   Kenny Foth, 48, and his 10-year-old son, Dalen, were part of a
28-person tour that saw an Oakland A's game this past week at the
Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum. They heard American League umpire
Tim Welke regale them with ``insider'' stories of his 16 years in
the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would make me feel more comfortable, if on the count of
three, you could all boo me,'' Welke joked.
</P>
<P>
   Foth, of Beulah, N.D., said the trip would cost him about
$4,500, but ``I guess I'm just a baseball fan. ... It's a good way
to spend some good time together.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Buckley, who runs Jay Buckley Tours, caters to less affluent
fans who take buses from city to city, while Jay Smith of Sports
Travel places fans in finer hotels and provides air travel between
cities separated more than four hours by car.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies say fans are of all ages and come from many
spectrums of life. At least a third of ballpark visitors are women,
who actually outnumbered men on such tours in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley says his single largest chunk _ 20 percent _ comes from
California, the vast majority from the San Francisco Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Smith says Californians also make up the largest portion of his
clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them could get sucked into the Sports Travel's
Millennium Tour, which for $5,000, will take clients to every major
league ballpark in America next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ann and George Elwood of Hancock, N.Y., are close to that goal _
with just four stadiums to go.

TRAINER HONORED FOR HELPING WITH RACING ADDICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LINDA TRISCHITTA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ A racecourse backstretch can foster an
unhealthy reliance on gambling, drugs or alcohol, racing veterans
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The backstretch, for an addictive personality, is paradise,''
said Rudy Rios, a certified alcoholism and substance abuse
counselor who runs an employee assistance program for the New York
Racing Association (NYRA) and has a caseload of 38 people at the
Saratoga Race Course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an equal opportunity sickness,'' he said of addiction.
``From grooms to trainers to owners and officers, we counsel a lot
of people to try to better their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   One man who donates his time to help backstretch workers was
honored by 60 prominent racing figures as a humanitarian and unsung
hero last week at the Reading Room, a private club at the track.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Perlsweig, the trainer who led Lord Avie to an Eclipse
Award in 1980, received the seventh annual Dogwood Dominion Award
for his volunteer efforts on behalf of backstretch workers at
Monmouth Park and Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tracks can't run without them,'' Perlsweig said of the
workers for whom he has presented a Backstretch Appreciation Day at
Monmouth Park since 1991. ``They're the people that make the game
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who nominated Perlsweig said his support of
workers struggling with addictions to alcohol, drugs and gambling
in the transitory racing business was another reason for his
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've helped a lot of them try to get off the hook, and give an
ear for them to talk,'' said Perlsweig, who was joined by his wife,
Patricia, son Mark and daughter Jude Stomel.
</P>
<P>
   Rios said that backstretch workers often come from very poor
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of these people are single, or come from other
countries to progress,'' Rios said. But instead, ``they become
desperate, lonely and unloved. Sometimes they are isolated if they
don't speak the language.''
</P>
<P>
   Rios said following the thoroughbreds from track to track, as
many workers do each year on the New York circuit, does not promote
health for the addict.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have lost their families,'' he said. ``We also try to
bond them with other people who are sober enough to care for them.
They don't have to be alone, and don't have to live only the
racetrack life.''
</P>
<P>
   After backstretch workers complete detoxification and
rehabilitation, Rios tries to help them return to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the program opened up in 1989, we've helped 373 people
keep their jobs,'' he said. ``It's modeled after Alcoholics
Anonymous. We have group therapy on dark days. I also do random
Breathalyzer and urine tests, and we have recovery houses for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Montemarano, who worked for Perlsweig for 15 years at
Monmouth Park and nominated him for the award, said it was the
unknown acts of kindness that defined a person's character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny totally changed my life,'' Montemarano said. ``He sets a
tremendous example as a positive role model.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famers jockey Pat Day and trainer Mack Miller were
judges, with Anne Campbell, the award sponsor with her husband,
Wade ``Cot'' Campbell, of Dogwood Stable in Aiken, S.C. They had to
decide among 35 nominees for the worthy candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny is so deserving for the work he does,'' said Day before
dashing to dress for the second race, when he rode Surfside to a
win. ``It's too bad we can only give one away. Choosing the winner
doesn't get any easier.'' Perlsweig's award included a $5,000 check
and a bronze sculpture of the Campbell's stallion, Dominion, a
horse called workmanlike, dependable and intelligent by his owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny is one of the best known and best liked characters in
all of racing, east of the Mississippi River,'' Cot Campbell said.
``If it's the right thing to do, Danny does it.''

A HUNGER FOR HOLINESS: RABBI PURSUES INTEREST IN TALMUD ON THE

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Rabbi judith Abrams likes to fantasize about getting a
phone call one day from director Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   Then the play she is co-writing about the Talmud might become
``Talmud: The Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The daydream amuses Abrams, a Reform rabbi with a growing
national reputation as an expert on the Talmud, a voluminous
collection of ancient Jewish oral law and commentary. It is second
only to the Torah in influence among Jews. Once the lonely preserve
of religious-minded scholars, the Talmud is gaining students. Many
find it on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams is founder and director of Maqom, an award-winning
cyber-school for adult Talmud study. ``Maqom'' is Hebrew for
``place'' and is another name for God.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talmud is the most spectacular, wonderful work of Jewish
literary and spiritual creativity, bar none,'' said Abrams, who
studied the Talmud for her Jewish studies doctorate from Baltimore
Hebrew University. ``It is amazing and enriching for a person's
intellect, soul and emotional life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Talmud is considered rabbinic literature and sometimes
called the Oral Torah. Jews believe that Moses received both the
written Torah (the first five books of the Bible) and the oral law
on Mount Sinai. ``It was put into his ear,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Moses came down from Sinai, he passed it on to the elders
and so on,'' Abrams said.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish law is known as ``Halakah`` (Aramaic for path or way).
Jews believe that being holy consists of obeying God's commands as
revealed in the Torah, both written and oral.
</P>
<P>
   In the second century A.D., Judah Ha-Nasi made the first
compilation of Jewish law (known as the Mishnah). Later rabbis
added their interpretations, which came to be known as the Gemara.
The Gemara, completed by A.D. 500, also includes Jewish history,
customs and folk tales.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the Mishnah and Gemara constitute the Talmud.
``Talmud'' is the Hebrew word for learning or instruction.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, devout rabbis and sages delved into Torah and
Mishnah passages to glean insightful spiritual truths for
practical, everyday application, Abrams said.
</P>
<P>
   They often engaged in detailed arguments on sometimes esoteric
topics (such as the proper way to light Hannukah candles). They
would cite Scripture and teachings of revered rabbis to bolster
their positions. Every aspect of life _ from prayer to sex to
business _ was considered in light of the Torah as part of an
unceasing search for godly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   While the Talmud is more than 15 centuries old, it applies to
modern life, Abrams said. The Talmud deals with vital spiritual and
secular issues such as the family, death, grief, child-rearing and
other evergreen topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has everything to say about modern life particularly when
you face difficult times,'' she said. ``It is a real tower of
strength to fall back on.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams shows how that holds true at her Internet site,
maqom.com. The site includes lessons exploring Jewish law and
tradition as they apply to such issues as parenting, death and
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   For generations Jews have turned to the Talmud for guidance,
Abrams said. For example, the ancients regarded physical disability
as defined by the state of the mind rather than the state of the
body, Abrams said. ``A person with no legs or a person who is blind
is considered hardly disabled at all,'' she said. They could still
learn, think and communicate, abilities that far outweighed their
disabilities, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In another portion of the Talmud, one sage visits another
bed-ridden sage. ``Aren't your sufferings precious to you?'' he
said to the suffering friend. ``Neither they nor their reward,'' he
replies. The first sage lifts his friend from the bed and cures
him. The story demonstrates that sufferings need not be welcomed or
tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to like suffering,'' Abrams said. Sufferers are
encouraged to look for cures or remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jews today know virtually nothing of the Talmud, Abrams
said. Until recently, the study of the Talmud was considered the
province of rabbinical students and devout Orthodox Jews. Usually
written in Hebrew, it was regarded as intimidatingly complicated
and arcane. The stories often require extensive background study
and invite reflection and discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talmudic study method requires looking at a problem from
all aspects,'' said Rabbi Joseph Radinsky of United Orthodox
Synagogues. It was Radinsky who introduced Abrams to the Talmud.
Talmudic study is best done in a study group, since topics need
discussion, arguments pro and con, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost axiomatic that adult Jews know nothing about the
Talmud, but I am trying to change that,'' said Abrams. ``(Jews)
have a feeling that it belongs to only somebody with a long beard
and a black hat,'' she said. ``What I am trying to show them is
that it belongs to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But Abrams acknowledges that the Talmud is sexist in some areas.
It was written by men for men, she admits, and she urges people:
``Just get over it.'' The Talmud's spiritual power overshadows its
faults, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her message is falling on receptive ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are recognizing they are missing out on something,''
Abrams said. ``They have achieved what they wanted to achieve: the
house, the boat, the car, the clothes. They are finding that it is
not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   They find they are missing the spiritual dimension in their
lives. ``Talmud is the great feeder of spiritual seekers,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Talmud) is beautiful,'' said recently retired Houston Jewish
educator Shirley Barish. ``There have been a number of us ready to
study the Talmud but you get a little afraid of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been the rabbis who studied the Talmud,'' Barish
said. ``And women didn't study the Talmud.'' But she joined Abrams'
Monday evening class four years ago and she is glad she did. She is
amazed at how wise the ancient sages really were.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn there is a time and a place for everything,'' she
said. Talmud studies have enriched her Jewish life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judaism is not a children's religion,'' said Marsha Schneider,
a Houston Jewish educator. ``There are no easy answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider began studying the Talmud with Abrams three years ago
as she was undergoing a divorce. Her study group became her support
group and helped her grow spiritually.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Houston classes, Abrams travels extensively
across the nation lecturing on the Talmud. In 1995, she launched
her cyber-school (http://www.maqom.com/). The Web site provides a
short Talmud lesson with discussion questions. Students can
participate in e-mail discussions. ``I teach from 100 to 200 people
here in Houston,'' she said. ``I teach thousands of people when I
lecture. And we get 60 hits a day on the Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   The cyber-school earned Abrams a 1999 Covenant Award for Jewish
Educators for contributing to the transmission of Jewish values,
knowledge and identity. The New York-based Covenant Foundation
selected three educators, including Abrams, from more than 400
nominees. The award, which carries a $20,000 prize, will be given
to Abrams on Nov. 16 at an awards ceremony in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams began her love affair with the Talmud in Houston while
serving as an assistant rabbi at Congregation Emanu El from 1985 to
1988, right after ordination. She attended a Talmud class taught by
Radinsky. ``He was the one who taught me to love it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Steven, moved to Washington, D.C., and
lived there for three years. It was during that time she began
doctoral studies and was a part-time rabbi for a Virginia Jewish
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Abrams, who now has three school age children, returned
to Houston as the part-time rabbi for Congregation Beth El in
nearby Missouri City.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, she resigned and the congregation hired a full-time
rabbi while launched Maqom.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Illinois, Abrams never expected to become a
Talmud-teaching rabbi. ``I thought I was going to be a DJ,'' she
said. She worked for radio stations doing newscasts and learned the
art of compressing a lot of information in brief reports. It is a
skill that comes in handy when writing lessons for her Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams attended Oberlin College in Ohio, majoring in
anthropology and Russian, giving up her DJ dreams. Her Christian
friends introduced her to daily prayer. Prayer became increasingly
important in her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in that way that I started developing a relationship
with God,'' said Abrams, whose parents were professors in medical
schools.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, her junior year, Abrams listed all the things she
enjoyed. They included: singing, teaching, praying, writing and
organizing. Only a rabbi could do all of that, she decided. She
graduated from Oberlin in 1980 and attended Hebrew Union College in
Cincinnati. She was ordained in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams hopes to finish her Talmud play over the next year. A
Talmudic musical is ``something that has been tickling my head for
a couple of years,'' Abrams said in the small den-office-library of
her southwest Houston home. She has been co-writing the script with
a New York playwright for a year and they are ready to compose the
lyrics and music.
</P>
<P>
   The musical is a natural outgrowth of Abrams' passion for the
Talmud, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She shares that passion with a growing national audience. She
frequently does guest lectures on the Talmud from Los Angeles to
New York. She has authored nine books on the Talmud, including a
three-volume work for beginners. She has also written six
children's books on Jewish tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of her Talmud play is a revered sage, Rabbi Baer Ben
Joseph Akiba, and his wife, Rachel. Rachel refused to marry Akiba,
then an illiterate shepherd, unless he went to a religious studies
school. He spent a total of 24 years studying and became a
legendary rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams intends to have the ancient sage and his wife appear on
stage to assist a modern couple, through song. She has high hopes
the musical will draw yet another audience to the Talmud.

`TEARDROP' IS A DEVIL OF A THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The many fans of Jeffrey Deaver's thrillers will be disappointed
to learn that ``The Devil's Teardrop'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25, 396
pages) does not feature the brilliant quadriplegic criminologist
Lincoln Rhyme (he does make a cameo appearance). But that is the
only disappointment that Deaver serves.
</P>
<P>
   At 9 a.m. on New Year's Eve, a lone gunman stands at the top of
the escalator at the Dupont Circle subway station in Washington,
D.C., fires 100 rounds from a concealed automatic weapon, and slips
away.
</P>
<P>
   A man calls the security desk at City Hall and says there is a
note about the subway killings under the Washington Post vending
machine outside the building. It reads: ``Mayor Kennedy _ The end
is night. The Digger is loose and their is no way to stop him. He
will kill again _ at four, 8 and midnight if you don't pay. I am
wanting $20 million dollars in cash ... Only I am knowing how to
stop The Digger. If you apprehend me, he will keep killing. If you
kill me, he will keep killing. ... Some of The Digger's bullets
were painted black. Only I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the FBI does find black bullets at the scene. Despite
objections, Mayor Gerald Kennedy decides to pay the ransom. The
FBI, led by Acting Special Agent in Charge Margaret Lukas, takes
the money to the designated field and waits for the terrorist, who
never shows. Eventually, Lukas and her colleagues learn the
terrorist was killed by a hit-and-run driver near City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The only clue is the ransom note, so Lukas asks Parker Kincaid,
the country's best expert in forensic document analysis, to help. A
single parent of two, Kincaid refuses until he learns a child was
killed in the subway carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Examining the note, he decides that the writer has planted red
herrings _ misspellings, bad grammar, etc. _ to make the FBI
believe its is not dealing with a brilliant criminal. The key clue
is the dotting of the i's _ a flourish known as the devil's
teardrop.
</P>
<P>
   With no way to contact the Digger, the FBI and Parker decide the
4 p.m. shooting scene most likely will be in D.C. Checking on what
large events are scheduled, Parker notices that a ``Nutcracker''
performance will be finishing just before 4. Lukas agrees to send
all her backup to the theater.
</P>
<P>
   The ending of this well-paced but truly deceptive thriller
caught me off guard. The analysis of the ransom note could have
been over-technical and boring, but Deaver makes it fascinating.
Full of good characters and dialogue, Deaver's writing is one of
the year's best thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ___ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don Winslow's arson thriller ``California Fire and Life''
(Alfred A. Knopf, $23, 337 pages) is a sure-fire, beach-book
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Nicky Vale is a power in Southern California real estate and the
local branch of the Russian mafia. When his wife dies in a fire at
their multimillion-dollar home, Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department arson investigator Brian (``Accidentally'') Bentley
rules the cause is accidental because Pamela Vale had been drinking
and smoking in bed.
</P>
<P>
   The California Fire and Life Mutual Insurance Company holds the
policy on the Vale home. Crack arson investigator Jack Wade is
assigned to check out the fire before the policies are paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that Bentley is sloppy, Wade discovers that the fire was
not accidental and begins a personal mission to prove that Vale
killed his wife to stop her from divorcing him _ and to collect
millions in fire insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Wade will run into Vietnamese chop shops, local
arsonists, Russian gangsters and his old love, Letita del Rio,
whose stepsister was Pamela Vale.
</P>
<P>
   ``California Fire and Life'' moves at a brisk pace. The
descriptions of Wade working the arson scene are engaging and
thought provoking. Good title. Good book.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ___ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Spring brings a fresh eye to her second murder mystery,
``Nights in White Satin'' (Ballantine Books, $23, 276 pages),
featuring private investigator Laura Principal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball had taken place as May Balls should always do, on a
warm night in the middle of June _ a champagne-and-oysters kind of
night, following a strawberries-and-cream kind of day. By early
evening, even a stranger to the city could sense that something
extraordinary was about to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Principal's firm had been hired to provide security at Cambridge
University's annual ball marking the end of exams.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of young people arrived in swarms and ate and drank too
much. But little damage was done and Principal felt good about the
assignment until the next day when she is told that Katie
Arkwright, who wore white satin, has disappeared. Although Katie
wasn't a student at Cambridge, the university authorities ask
Principal to find out what happened to the girl.
</P>
<P>
   Principal learns of an upper-crust old boys' network
``conspiracy of silence'' to cover up a drunken assault months
before that involved Katie. Things grow more sinister when a
university dean is murdered in his office.
</P>
<P>
   The skeleton of a baby is found hidden in a student's room. And
Principal learns of a very dark side of the missing girl's past.
</P>
<P>
   Spring deftly has captured the essence of Cambridge and the
British upper class. Pert dialogue propels a well-paced plot line.
Perfect English cozy for a foggy weekend afternoon.

DISNEYLAND MESSY OUTSIDE, STILL MAGIC INSIDE

RUNS WITH DISNELAND-GO BOX and DISNEYLAND-PASSES 
Has art 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The signs of the times at Disneyland are bright
orange and bear messages that are inconsistent with the happiest
place on this or any planet: Uneven Pavement. Lane Closed. Detour.
Open Trench. Bump Ahead.
</P>
<P>
   There are other signs, purple ones, put up by the park itself.
They read: Great Things Are Happening! Pardon Our Progress! We're
Making Improvements!
</P>
<P>
   The latter ones seem to be strategically placed _ at locations
where visitors are most likely to be ensnarled in traffic, engulfed
in dust, assaulted by the beep-beep-beep of heavy equipment in
reverse gear. In the exclamation points on all those signs, you can
almost hear the high-pitched squeak of perpetual optimism and good
cheer.
</P>
<P>
   These are times of great upheaval for Disneyland and its
surrounding neighborhood in Anaheim, such that regular visitors
from Southern California should prepare for a test of their
patience. Three major construction projects are being conducted
simultaneously, and getting to, into and out of the popular theme
park can be a challenge _ particularly in the park's busy summer
season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; A 10-mile stretch of Interstate 5 is being widened to
accommodate the crush of traffic that passes daily through this
area of Orange County. New off-ramps that will funnel traffic
directly into Disneyland's parking areas are being constructed,
too. Currently, the construction mess begins around Beach Boulevard
on the I-5 south, about six miles from Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Several major side streets are being widened, improved,
beautified. Most of that work is nearing completion, but
negotiating such major thoroughfares as Harbor Boulevard, Katella
Avenue and Ball Road is still hectic.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; That massive parking lot in front of Disneyland? It's all
but gone, plowed under to make room for a $1.4 billion addition _
theme park, hotel, shopping and entertainment area _ scheduled to
be up and running by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   To Disneyland's credit, however, the business of fantasy
continues as usual, with minimal disruption.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the parking has been shifted to grounds around the
Disneyland Hotel, directly west of the park, and high-tech trams,
using special routes that they don't have to share with any other
vehicles, regularly whisk visitors through and around the
construction zones to the ticket booths.
</P>
<P>
   And once you step through the main gates, you're only vaguely
aware of the construction chaos without.
</P>
<P>
   Your little ones can terrorize one of the big, fuzzy characters
walking about. Your teens can swelter in a 90-minute line for the
Rocket Rods _ if you're lucky enough to be there on a day when the
troubled attraction is not broken down. You, meanwhile, can
reminisce about the bygone days when there were mules, motor boats,
flying saucers and a ``house of the future'' built entirely out of
plastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The park is evolving and changing,'' said Disneyland spokesman
Ray Gomez. ``It's moving from a single theme park to a destination
resort, where people will want to come and spend several days,
enjoying both parks as well as shopping, entertainment and
dining.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the changes might cause Disneyland traditionalists to
raise a skeptical eyebrow. The new theme park in the old parking
lot will be titled the California Adventure, designed to tap into
the myth of the Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   One area will seek to re-create the beach amusement parks of old
(think Pacific Ocean Park). There will be a carnival-style midway
and conventional amusement park rides. The superstructure for a
Ferris wheel is already up, as is the framework for a looping
roller coaster _ built of steel, made to look like whitewashed
wood.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, that rumble you just felt was Walt Disney rolling over
in his grave.
</P>
<P>
   When Disney first attempted to launch his theme park in the
early 1950s, he wanted it to be in Burbank, near his movie and
animation studios, but city fathers weren't keen on the idea of
having a carny atmosphere so near. They couldn't know that Disney's
boundless imagination envisioned something entirely different: a
squeaky-clean environment with cleverly designed rides, from flying
elephants to a roller coaster-like attraction that would be
disguised as bobsleds hurtling down a famous Alp.
</P>
<P>
   Disney had no choice but to seek out some cheap orange-grove
land much farther south.
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful he would be thrilled with what's on the design
table now, but it's been 33 years since his death in 1966, and
Disneyland, facing strenuous theme-park competition in Southern
California, feels it must broaden its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Braverman, the Walt Disney Imagineering executive
directing the new project, has said in interviews that California
Adventure will be a ``pop-culture'' park, and has invoked such
words as hip, irreverent and contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disneyland Resort will always be a family destination,'' said
Gomez, ``but at the same time, California Adventure will be an
altogether different experience. Disneyland is a place of fantasy.
California Adventure will immerse you in the California experience
_ the California dream, the myth of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of it lends itself to being a family experience, but you
can offer different types of experiences at different parks.''
</P>
<P>
   Another feature being built in the old parking lot is Downtown
Disney, an area of shops, restaurants and nightclub entertainment.
Also going in is a 750-room deluxe hotel in craftsman architecture,
which will offer upscale travelers an alternative to the tired '60s
ambience of the Disneyland Hotel complex.
</P>
<P>
   To make up for all the displaced parking spaces, an enormous
multilevel parking structure is being built just north of the
Disneyland Hotel, where a KOA campground used to stand. It's a long
way from the park entrance, which means the days of making the
sleepy-eyed walk from the main gates to the car are gone for good.
</P>
<P>
   While all of this is going up, Disneyland visitors can encounter
a minimum of construction-related inconvenience ... but only if
they plan in advance.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, the situation is much less chaotic than it was
at this time last year, when the detours to the I-5 seemed to be
extraordinarily convoluted.
</P>
<P>
   The most important step should be to obtain driving directions
from one of two Disneyland information outlets. On the Web, visit
www.disney.go.com/disneyland (click on ``Plan Your Visit,'' then on
``Disneyland Today''). You'll be able to indicate which geographic
area you're coming from to get specific directions. Or, if you
prefer to get this information from a person, call (714) 781-4560.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, driving directions are changed as the
construction projects reach different stages, and Disneyland
officials seem to present the most viable options.
</P>
<P>
   On two recent trips to the area, approaches were made from a
variety of directions in an attempt to find a quicker route than
the one officially suggested. All such efforts proved futile. Signs
prohibit left turns into the parking lot from some directions, for
example; it appears the traffic cops at Disney have taken great
pains to foil short-cut artists during the construction work.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site and the folks on the information line also provide
news of daily ride closures. Neither, however, alerts you to the
current disruption of the Monorail ride.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of its track runs right through the construction
project in the parking lot, so although the ride is still running,
it no longer operates in a loop between its Tomorrowland station
and the Disneyland Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, two trains work a one-way stretch of track to the
hotel, unload all passengers, fill up again, then run in reverse
back into the park. Signs warn that one leg of this short trip _
even after you've been let onto the loading platform _ can take a
half hour, and on a visit in mid-July, the journey required exactly
that.
</P>
<P>
   The disrupted Monorail service primarily impacts people staying
at the Disneyland Hotel _ also adults sneaking off to the hotel for
a better grade of food and a beverage that contains something other
than sugar, syrup and carbonated water.
</P>
<P>
   For the return trip to the park, if the Monorail line is
oppressively long, a better option is to jump a hotel tram. It
loads behind the adjacent Disneyland Pacific Hotel; that's a bit of
a walk, but there is no waiting.
</P>
<P>
   When it's time to leave Disneyland for the drive home, confusion
can reign anew. Maybe it's just my imagination, but it seems the
series of signs leading you into the park area is comprehensive and
clear, while the directions for your trip home are ... well, you're
kind of on your own.
</P>
<P>
   One key tip: When you're leaving the Pinocchio and Simba parking
lots at the Disneyland Hotel complex, be advised that the left turn
off Ball Road onto the northbound I-5 is no longer permitted _
because the on-ramp no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, you must turn right off Ball onto Harbor Boulevard
(southbound), then immediately careen left across three lanes of
traffic in hopes of catching the poorly marked and dimly lit
on-ramp for the I-5 north. There is minimal warning for this
maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   And, no, the sign doesn't have an exclamation point. After a day
of navigating the tumult that encircles Disneyland this summer,
that punctuation mark will be in your head. &UR;  &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ If you're weary of inching through interminable
lines at Disneyland _ particularly for high-demand attractions _
take heart. Relief is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Fastpass, a ride reservations system that has been a big hit at
Walt Disney World in Florida, was tested a couple of weeks ago at
Disneyland in Anaheim. It proved to be such a success that park
spokesman Tom Brocato predicted it would be instituted on three
popular rides _ Indiana Jones, Space Mountain and Splash Mountain _
in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like walking into a restaurant with a dinner
reservation,'' Brocato said. ``You have an 8 o'clock reservation.
There are a few people ahead of you. But you sit down at 8:05.''
</P>
<P>
   Fastpass was put through a trial at Space Mountain recently.
Here's how it works:
</P>
<P>
   At the ride entrance, there is an area where visitors can skip
the main line, walk up to a machine that will scan their day's
passport and issue a special pass. The pass will give them a future
window of opportunity to board the ride through a separate line.
For example, if you pick up a pass at 11 a.m., you might be given a
window of noon to 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Then the visitor heads off to enjoy another ride, get something
to eat, see a parade. Upon returning, he or she enters a special
Fastpass line. The main line for the attraction is held up
periodically to let these guests on. And in the recent tests at
Space Mountain, the Fastpass line routinely required a wait of
three to five minutes, Brocato said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People absolutely loved it,'' he added. ``It gives you a
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   A fixed number of Fastpasses are issued, in increments of five
minutes. (Following the example cited above, a certain number of
passes would be issued for the 11:05 a.m.-to-12:05 p.m. window,
followed by the same number for the 11:10 a.m.-to-12:10 p.m.
window, etc.).
</P>
<P>
   If you miss your window, your pass expires. There is no limit to
the number of Fastpasses a visitor can acquire in a day, but
because there will always be a built-in lag on the validity of the
pass _ a 45-minute or an hour delay before you can use it, for
example _ the prospect for abuse is considered minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Brocato added that if the Fastpass proves successful on the
three Disneyland rides in January, it could be instituted widely
throughout the park _ even on such slow-moving, parent-crunching
lines as that found at Dumbo the Flying Elephant.
</P>
<P>
   Fastpass was instituted in response to guests' complaints about
long lines.
</P>
<P>
   Another provision, targeted directly at parents with young
children, is the child switch pass. It applies to any attraction
for which there is an age or height requirement.
</P>
<P>
   One parent waits in line while the other entertains the kids
elsewhere. The parent with the kids eventually enters the
attraction through the exit and waits with the kids in a side area.
Once the parent in line goes on the ride, he or she takes over with
the kids, and the parent who has been shepherding the kids gets to
ride without waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Disneyland spokesman Lynn Holt says provisions for the child
switch pass vary by attraction. He urged parents to approach the
attendants at the entrance to the attractions and ask how the
switch works on that particular ride. &UR;  &QL;

<P>
   COSTS: Disneyland admission is $39 for adults, $29 for children
ages 3 to 11, $37 for seniors ages 60 and up. Two- and three-day
passports are available. Parking is $7, $8 for RVs (overnight
parking is not permitted).
</P>
<P>
   HOURS: During the summer, the park is open from 8 a.m. until
midnight. Disneyland goes to a shorter schedule after Labor Day
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S NEW: Tarzan's Treehouse recently opened in Adventureland.
It replaces the Swiss Family Robinson Treehouse _ and bears a
striking resemblance to the old attraction. In fact, you're left to
wonder if they simply changed the sign out front. Little ones
hooked on the movie will love it, though; there's an interactive
area at the base of the tree. Tomorrowland has been refurbished,
but you'll wonder if the designers did nothing more than give
everything a coat of paint, move the rocket jets a few hundred feet
and add the Rocket Rods, an attraction which runs on the old People
Mover track and has been subject to chronic breakdowns.

   LAST WEEK'S TRANSMISSION:
</P>
<P>
   LATINO AMERICA: NEWSWEEK VS. GEORGE MAGAZINE. Is it the ``La
Bamba'' syndrome, or have Latinos in the United States really come
of age? Newsweek and George magazines recently tried to answer that
question, though with varying degrees of success. James Garcia,
editor and publisher of Politico, a national weekly newsletter on
U.S. Latino politics, reports that Newsweek did a generally
admirable job of laying out the trends in U.S. Latino culture,
while George magazine's cool and cutesy approach left a lot to be
desired. A report on what the coverage of these magazines says
about how the news media views U.S. Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   BAD THINGS DON'T JUST HAPPEN IN THE INNER CITIES. In the months
since the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
there have been Senate hearings on the impact of violence on
children and a White House summit on youth violence. But what about
Angelique Dunn of Washington, D.C., and her 9-year-old son who was
shot while riding his bike outside his home? Who is looking out for
the Dunn family who lives in the inner city? In this commentary
from Emerge magazine, Kevin Merida reports on horrific acts of
violence committed by kids, and against kids, and its effects on
the nation. ``(In this country), a catharsis seems only to occur
when the victims of the crimes are white and the killers are white
and the community affected is white,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   THE EROSION OF CIVIL RIGHTS FOR ASIAN-AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS. In
1988, Xuan Wilson forged a check for $19.83 at a grocery store. She
served her time and has since gotten her life back together. _ Yet
Wilson _ who is a legal permanent resident of the United States _
may be deported because of recent immigration laws passed by
Congress. If deported, she will have to leave behind her husband,
her parents and three small children _ all of whom are U.S.
citizens. In this commentary from A. magazine, Joann H. Lee, an
attorney with the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium
in Washington, D.C., reports on how the Anti-Terrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and
Immigrant Responsibility Act punish this country's legal immigrants
with a vengeance that far exceeds the seriousness of their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGIOUS LIBERTY SHOULD NOT VIOLATE CIVIL RIGHTS FOR GAYS. The
Religious Liberty Protection Act (RLPA), which recently went
through the House of Representatives, would prevent state and local
governments from ``substantially burden(ing) a person's religious
exercise'' unless there is a demonstrably ``compelling'' reason to
do so. But in its current form the bill poses a very real threat to
gay civil rights because it lacks a civil-rights exemption that
prohibits the exercise of religious liberty as a justification for
denying employment and housing opportunities to gay men and
lesbians. ``What religious liberty rights would be lost or weakened
by the inclusion of a civil-rights provision?'' asks columnist
Chuck Colbert. In this commentary, Colbert argues that the Senate
should reject the RLPA unless lawmakers safeguard the civil rights
of gays. Colbert serves on the board of directors of the National
Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association.
</P>
<P>
   KILLING THE U.S.A. BY COUNTING PEOPLE. There is another attack
on illegal aliens from the far-right flank, writes columnist Raoul
Lowery Contreras. Charles Wood, a former Justice Department Policy
Analyst, has written an article for the Harvard Journal of Law and
Policy that, according to Contreras, stretches credulity on the
question of whether or not illegal aliens should be counted in the
coming 2000 Census or in subsequent censuses. In this commentary,
Contreras debunks Woods arguments.

   RELIGIOUS LIBERTY SHOULD NOT VIOLATE CIVIL RIGHTS FOR GAYS. The
Religious Liberty Protection Act (RLPA), which recently went
through the House of Representatives, would prevent state and local
governments from ``substantially burden(ing) a person's religious
exercise'' unless there is a demonstrably ``compelling'' reason to
do so. But in its current form the bill poses a very real threat to
gay civil rights because it lacks a civil-rights exemption that
prohibits the exercise of religious liberty as a justification for
denying employment and housing opportunities to gay men and
lesbians. ``What religious liberty rights would be lost or weakened
by the inclusion of a civil-rights provision?'' asks columnist
Chuck Colbert. In this commentary, Colbert argues that the Senate
should reject the RLPA unless lawmakers safeguard the civil rights
of gays. Colbert serves on the board of directors of the National
Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association.

<P>
   KILLING THE U.S.A. BY COUNTING PEOPLE. There is another attack
on illegal aliens from the far-right flank, writes columnist Raoul
Lowery Contreras. Charles Wood, a former Justice Department Policy
Analyst, has written an article for the Harvard Journal of Law and
Policy that, according to Contreras, stretches credulity on the
question of whether or not illegal aliens should be counted in the
coming 2000 Census or in subsequent censuses. In this commentary,
Contreras debunks Woods arguments.

   LAST WEEK'S TRANSMISSION:
</P>
<P>
   LATINO AMERICA: NEWSWEEK VS. GEORGE MAGAZINE. Is it the ``La
Bamba'' syndrome, or have Latinos in the United States really come
of age? Newsweek and George magazines recently tried to answer that
question, though with varying degrees of success. James Garcia,
editor and publisher of Politico, a national weekly newsletter on
U.S. Latino politics, reports that Newsweek did a generally
admirable job of laying out the trends in U.S. Latino culture,
while George magazine's cool and cutesy approach left a lot to be
desired. A report on what the coverage of these magazines says
about how the news media views U.S. Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   BAD THINGS DON'T JUST HAPPEN IN THE INNER CITIES. In the months
since the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
there have been Senate hearings on the impact of violence on
children and a White House summit on youth violence. But what about
Angelique Dunn of Washington, D.C., and her 9-year-old son who was
shot while riding his bike outside his home? Who is looking out for
the Dunn family who lives in the inner city? In this commentary
from Emerge magazine, Kevin Merida reports on horrific acts of
violence committed by kids, and against kids, and its effects on
the nation. ``(In this country), a catharsis seems only to occur
when the victims of the crimes are white and the killers are white
and the community affected is white,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   THE EROSION OF CIVIL RIGHTS FOR ASIAN-AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS. In
1988, Xuan Wilson forged a check for $19.83 at a grocery store. She
served her time and has since gotten her life back together. _ Yet
Wilson _ who is a legal permanent resident of the United States _
may be deported because of recent immigration laws passed by
Congress. If deported, she will have to leave behind her husband,
her parents and three small children _ all of whom are U.S.
citizens. In this commentary from A. magazine, Joann H. Lee, an
attorney with the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium
in Washington, D.C., reports on how the Anti-Terrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and
Immigrant Responsibility Act punish this country's legal immigrants
with a vengeance that far exceeds the seriousness of their crimes.

   LAST WEEK'S TRANSMISSION:
</P>
<P>
   LATINO AMERICA: NEWSWEEK VS. GEORGE MAGAZINE. Is it the ``La
Bamba'' syndrome, or have Latinos in the United States really come
of age? Newsweek and George magazines recently tried to answer that
question, though with varying degrees of success. James Garcia,
editor and publisher of Politico, a national weekly newsletter on
U.S. Latino politics, reports that Newsweek did a generally
admirable job of laying out the trends in U.S. Latino culture,
while George magazine's cool and cutesy approach left a lot to be
desired. A report on what the coverage of these magazines says
about how the news media views U.S. Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   BAD THINGS DON'T JUST HAPPEN IN THE INNER CITIES. In the months
since the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
there have been Senate hearings on the impact of violence on
children and a White House summit on youth violence. But what about
Angelique Dunn of Washington, D.C., and her 9-year-old son who was
shot while riding his bike outside his home? Who is looking out for
the Dunn family who lives in the inner city? In this commentary
from Emerge magazine, Kevin Merida reports on horrific acts of
violence committed by kids, and against kids, and its effects on
the nation. ``(In this country), a catharsis seems only to occur
when the victims of the crimes are white and the killers are white
and the community affected is white,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   THE EROSION OF CIVIL RIGHTS FOR ASIAN-AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS. In
1988, Xuan Wilson forged a check for $19.83 at a grocery store. She
served her time and has since gotten her life back together. _ Yet
Wilson _ who is a legal permanent resident of the United States _
may be deported because of recent immigration laws passed by
Congress. If deported, she will have to leave behind her husband,
her parents and three small children _ all of whom are U.S.
citizens. In this commentary from A. magazine, Joann H. Lee, an
attorney with the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium
in Washington, D.C., reports on how the Anti-Terrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and
Immigrant Responsibility Act punish this country's legal immigrants
with a vengeance that far exceeds the seriousness of their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGIOUS LIBERTY SHOULD NOT VIOLATE CIVIL RIGHTS FOR GAYS. The
Religious Liberty Protection Act (RLPA), which recently went
through the House of Representatives, would prevent state and local
governments from ``substantially burden(ing) a person's religious
exercise'' unless there is a demonstrably ``compelling'' reason to
do so. But in its current form the bill poses a very real threat to
gay civil rights because it lacks a civil-rights exemption that
prohibits the exercise of religious liberty as a justification for
denying employment and housing opportunities to gay men and
lesbians. ``What religious liberty rights would be lost or weakened
by the inclusion of a civil-rights provision?'' asks columnist
Chuck Colbert. In this commentary, Colbert argues that the Senate
should reject the RLPA unless lawmakers safeguard the civil rights
of gays. Colbert serves on the board of directors of the National
Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association.
</P>
<P>
   KILLING THE U.S.A. BY COUNTING PEOPLE. There is another attack
on illegal aliens from the far-right flank, writes columnist Raoul
Lowery Contreras. Charles Wood, a former Justice Department Policy
Analyst, has written an article for the Harvard Journal of Law and
Policy that, according to Contreras, stretches credulity on the
question of whether or not illegal aliens should be counted in the
coming 2000 Census or in subsequent censuses. In this commentary,
Contreras debunks Woods arguments.

Bamba'' syndrome, or have Latinos in the United States really come
of age? Newsweek and George magazines recently tried to answer that
question, though with varying degrees of success. James Garcia,
editor and publisher of Politico, a national weekly newsletter on
U.S. Latino politics, reports that Newsweek did a generally
admirable job of laying out the trends in U.S. Latino culture,
while George magazine's cool and cutesy approach left a lot to be
desired. A report on what the coverage of these magazines says
about how the news media views U.S. Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   BAD THINGS DON'T JUST HAPPEN IN THE INNER CITIES. In the months
since the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
there have been Senate hearings on the impact of violence on
children and a White House summit on youth violence. But what about
Angelique Dunn of Washington, D.C., and her 9-year-old son who was
shot while riding his bike outside his home? Who is looking out for
the Dunn family who lives in the inner city? In this commentary
from Emerge magazine, Kevin Merida reports on horrific acts of
violence committed by kids, and against kids, and its effects on
the nation. ``(In this country), a catharsis seems only to occur
when the victims of the crimes are white and the killers are white
and the community affected is white,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   THE EROSION OF CIVIL RIGHTS FOR ASIAN-AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS. In
1988, Xuan Wilson forged a check for $19.83 at a grocery store. She
served her time and has since gotten her life back together. _ Yet
Wilson _ who is a legal permanent resident of the United States _
may be deported because of recent immigration laws passed by
Congress. If deported, she will have to leave behind her husband,
her parents and three small children _ all of whom are U.S.
citizens. In this commentary from A. magazine, Joann H. Lee, an
attorney with the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium
in Washington, D.C., reports on how the Anti-Terrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and
Immigrant Responsibility Act punish this country's legal immigrants
with a vengeance that far exceeds the seriousness of their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGIOUS LIBERTY SHOULD NOT VIOLATE CIVIL RIGHTS FOR GAYS. The
Religious Liberty Protection Act (RLPA), which recently went
through the House of Representatives, would prevent state and local
governments from ``substantially burden(ing) a person's religious
exercise'' unless there is a demonstrably ``compelling'' reason to
do so. But in its current form the bill poses a very real threat to
gay civil rights because it lacks a civil-rights exemption that
prohibits the exercise of religious liberty as a justification for
denying employment and housing opportunities to gay men and
lesbians. ``What religious liberty rights would be lost or weakened
by the inclusion of a civil-rights provision?'' asks columnist
Chuck Colbert. In this commentary, Colbert argues that the Senate
should reject the RLPA unless lawmakers safeguard the civil rights
of gays. Colbert serves on the board of directors of the National
Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association.
</P>
<P>
   KILLING THE U.S.A. BY COUNTING PEOPLE. There is another attack
on illegal aliens from the far-right flank, writes columnist Raoul
Lowery Contreras. Charles Wood, a former Justice Department Policy
Analyst, has written an article for the Harvard Journal of Law and
Policy that, according to Contreras, stretches credulity on the
question of whether or not illegal aliens should be counted in the
coming 2000 Census or in subsequent censuses. In this commentary,
Contreras debunks Woods arguments.

   LAST WEEK'S TRANSMISSION:
</P>
<P>
   LATINO AMERICA: NEWSWEEK VS. GEORGE MAGAZINE. Is it the ``La
Bamba'' syndrome, or have Latinos in the United States really come
of age? Newsweek and George magazines recently tried to answer that
question, though with varying degrees of success. James Garcia,
editor and publisher of Politico, a national weekly newsletter on
U.S. Latino politics, reports that Newsweek did a generally
admirable job of laying out the trends in U.S. Latino culture,
while George magazine's cool and cutesy approach left a lot to be
desired. A report on what the coverage of these magazines says
about how the news media views U.S. Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   BAD THINGS DON'T JUST HAPPEN IN THE INNER CITIES. In the months
since the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
there have been Senate hearings on the impact of violence on
children and a White House summit on youth violence. But what about
Angelique Dunn of Washington, D.C., and her 9-year-old son who was
shot while riding his bike outside his home? Who is looking out for
the Dunn family who lives in the inner city? In this commentary
from Emerge magazine, Kevin Merida reports on horrific acts of
violence committed by kids, and against kids, and its effects on
the nation. ``(In this country), a catharsis seems only to occur
when the victims of the crimes are white and the killers are white
and the community affected is white,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   THE EROSION OF CIVIL RIGHTS FOR ASIAN-AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS. In
1988, Xuan Wilson forged a check for $19.83 at a grocery store. She
served her time and has since gotten her life back together. _ Yet
Wilson _ who is a legal permanent resident of the United States _
may be deported because of recent immigration laws passed by
Congress. If deported, she will have to leave behind her husband,
her parents and three small children _ all of whom are U.S.
citizens. In this commentary from A. magazine, Joann H. Lee, an
attorney with the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium
in Washington, D.C., reports on how the Anti-Terrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and
Immigrant Responsibility Act punish this country's legal immigrants
with a vengeance that far exceeds the seriousness of their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGIOUS LIBERTY SHOULD NOT VIOLATE CIVIL RIGHTS FOR GAYS. The
Religious Liberty Protection Act (RLPA), which recently went
through the House of Representatives, would prevent state and local
governments from ``substantially burden(ing) a person's religious
exercise'' unless there is a demonstrably ``compelling'' reason to
do so. But in its current form the bill poses a very real threat to
gay civil rights because it lacks a civil-rights exemption that
prohibits the exercise of religious liberty as a justification for
denying employment and housing opportunities to gay men and
lesbians. ``What religious liberty rights would be lost or weakened
by the inclusion of a civil-rights provision?'' asks columnist
Chuck Colbert. In this commentary, Colbert argues that the Senate
should reject the RLPA unless lawmakers safeguard the civil rights
of gays. Colbert serves on the board of directors of the National
Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association.
</P>
<P>
   KILLING THE U.S.A. BY COUNTING PEOPLE. There is another attack
on illegal aliens from the far-right flank, writes columnist Raoul
Lowery Contreras. Charles Wood, a former Justice Department Policy
Analyst, has written an article for the Harvard Journal of Law and
Policy that, according to Contreras, stretches credulity on the
question of whether or not illegal aliens should be counted in the
coming 2000 Census or in subsequent censuses. In this commentary,
Contreras debunks Woods arguments.

<HEADLINE>
MEDINAH'S MAJOR SUBPLOT IS RYDER CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ As he stood on the first tee at Medinah Country
Club Monday, Ben Crenshaw gazed out at the opening yards of a
demanding golf challenge that will no doubt prove too much for his
once-rich talents. The fairways are too tight, the rough too high,
the holes too long for a 47-year-old who has missed the cut in each
of his 12 starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   Having broken 70 just once in 25 rounds this year, Crenshaw
brings very little game into this 81st edition of the PGA
Championship. So why could he possibly be smiling?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because the Ryder Cup is less than two months away and
things couldn't have fallen together any sweeter for the United
States captain. Just a few weeks ago in New York, Crenshaw said,
``The team is shaping up nicely. I like what I'm seeing.'' This was
just after Payne Stewart clinched a spot, but before Justin Leonard
and Tom Lehman made their moves. All three are players he covets.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Crenshaw opted to be a player, not a coach. But it was
not lost on some observers whom he chose to head out onto the
course with: Leonard and Lanny Wadkins.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, like Crenshaw a Texan, figures to be a key member of
this year's team, and Wadkins is a close friend who went through
the rigors of being captain in 1995. Taking a little European hide
had to be the topic of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Championship, which gets under way Thursday at this
historic course outside Chicago, is the last chance for US players
to gather points. The top five (David Duval, Tiger Woods, Stewart,
Davis Love, and Mark O'Meara) have clinched spots. Hal Sutton and
Leonard are next and they appear to be locks.
</P>
<P>
   Those in spots 8-10 (Jim Furyk, Phil Mickelson, Jeff Maggert)
control their own fate, of course, though the mention of
Mickelson's name brings a smile to Crenshaw's face. He has said
that it is difficult for him to picture the team without Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   If Leonard and Mickelson maintain their Top 10 status, it would
give Crenshaw greater flexibility with his two captain's picks. One
good guess is Lehman (assuming he does not finish strongly here and
make the team automatically) and there's always the lurking
presence of Fred Couples. He is 17th, but he's been on the last
five teams and has displayed a fire for the Ryder Cup that isn't
apparent week in and week out. Throw in the fact that Couples is
immensley popular and you can be warned not to bet against Crenshaw
taking him.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Europeans, they have this week and next week's BMW
International Open before the points system comes to a close. And
unlike Crenshaw, captain Mark James has been playing well, though
not smiling. That's because his Top 10 features six rookies _ one
of whom, Jean Van de Velde, will take memories of his British Open
collapse to any match that goes to the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   The next two weeks are key events for Bernhard Langer (11th) and
Sergio Garcia (12th). One of them needs to move up, or else James
will be forced to choose between them for his second captain's
pick. (Jesper Parnevik is an obvious choice.) It would not have
seemed possible a few weeks ago, but the Europeans could come to
Brookline, Mass., without Garcia; he left Carnoustie shell-shocked,
played indifferently at the European Open, then missed the cut at
the Buick Open.
</P>
<P>
   A seasoned veteran such as Langer, some theorize, would be
better-suited for a young European team.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Medinah CC will play to 7,401 yards, with only two holes under
400 yards (except for the par 3's, naturally). There is one tiny
par 5 of 530 yards, but the other three measure more than 580, and
three of the four par 3's are at least 206 yards. Which is to say,
the lads had better load up on their titanium.
</P>
<P>
   When Hale Irwin won the 1990 US Open here, the course played to
7,175 yards, though the PGA of America has graciously kept it to a
par 72. It is the longest course for a major championship held at
sea level. CBS commentator David Feherty told reporters that
Medinah has four par 3s, two par 6s, and 12 par 5s.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson was one of the first to get a look, playing the back
nine with Chris DiMarco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an excellent test of golf,'' said Mickelson. ``The golf
course requires a lot of great shot-making.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, see effects of the tough stretch of hot weather
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over half the greens were brown in color,'' said Mickelson.
``It just didn't look like it was healthy. I don't know if that's
going to present a problem or not. They certainly rolled fine; the
ball rolled over it fine.''

UNITED ISN'T IN HIGH GEAR

   The Manchester United juggernaut is off to a slow start. United,
which lost to Arsenal in the Charity Shield last week, tied
Everton, 1-1, at Liverpool in their English Premier League opener
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   United was at full strength, with strikers Andy Cole and Dwight
Yorke running rampant at the start of the game. Yorke scored in the
seventh minute, but United seemed vulnerable after that, unable to
outmaneuver 37-year-old central defenders Richard Gough and Dave
Watson. Gough, formerly of the Kansas City Wizards and San Jose
Clash, was named man of the match.
</P>
<P>
   Jaap Stam headed in an own goal in the 87th minute to tie the
score, but Everton deserved at least a draw after pressuring
goalkeeper Mark Bosnich, shaky in his debut as Peter Schmeichel's
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   There will be little time to reflect as United plays its home
opener against Sheffield Wednesday, giving an indication of the
overloaded schedule that prompted United to abandon the FA Cup
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester United has already won the Triple Crown _ Premier
League, FA Cup, and Champions League _ and is going for a Grand
Slam against Lazio in the European Super Cup Aug. 27. As long as
superfluous themes are being assigned to its conquests, the
December meeting with Palmeiras in Tokyo for the Toyota Cup could
be labeled the Fifth Wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea showed that it could become United's top challenger
after a 4-0 wipeout of Sunderland that apparently could have been
much worse had striker Chris Sutton and his replacement, Tore Andre
Flo, been in sync with their teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Gianfranco Zola led the way for Chelsea, with strong support
from Frenchman Didier Deschamps and Uruguayan striker Gustavo
Poyet. With Deschamps anchoring the midfield in front of countrymen
Marcel Desailly and Frank Leboeuf, the Blues seem confident of
their chances of a first league title since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finding the range
</P>
<P>
   The decision of US national team coach Bruce Arena to allow
Claudio Reyna to remain with Rangers during the Confederations Cup
seems to be paying off for Reyna. Rangers took a 4-0 victory over
Hearts, and Reyna scored twice, giving him three goals in two
games. Reyna combined well with Dutchman Michael Mols, who set up
Reyna for a tap-in, then converted the second goal in first-half
injury time, and again set up German Jorge Albertz for the third.
But Parma, Rangers' opponent in the Champions Cup Tuesday in
Glasgow, will provide a tougher test . . . Bayern Munich is still
recovering from its stunning last-second loss to Manchester United
in the Champions League and German Cup final defeat. But Bayern
will be the favorite as it begins the Bundesliga season against
Hamburg Saturday. Stefan Effenberg, goalkeeper Oliver Kahn,
Ghanaian Sammy Kuffour, and Brazilian Paulo Sergio will miss the
game with injuries. And Paraguayan striker Roque Santa Cruz has
been barred from playing because he has not yet turned 18.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Troubling signs
</P>
<P>
   Martin Palermo missed another penalty kick, this time for Boca
Juniors. But Palermo, who had three failed penalties for Argentina
against Colombia in the Copa America last month, converted twice
and Diego Cagna once as Boca Juniors took a 3-0 victory over
Independiente. But Boca Juniors has other problems. President
Mauricio Macri announced that bonuses to players will be reduced
this season, despite the team's success. This placed doubt on Boca
Juniors' visit to Barcelona to play in the Trofeo de los Campeones
tournament this week, as the players threatened to rebel. ``We
aren't in a war but this already seems like Sarajevo,'' Jose
Basualdo told the Buenos Aires daily Clarin. Questions also have
been raised about Macri's refusal to pay expenses for a proposed
Diego Maradona farewell game. Maradona, 39, has yet to be honored
with the traditional sendoff match, despite assurances from Julio
Grondona, president of the Asociacion del Futbol Argentino. Last
week, a crowd of more than 70,000 packed River Plate's Estadio
Monumental for a testimonial game for Uruguayan midfielder Enzo
``El Principe'' Francescoli. Maradona's goodbye should be more on
the scale of a world tour than a single game . . . England,
Morocco, and South Africa led off proposals to organize the 2006
World Cup during meetings at FIFA headquarters in Zurich. The
English delegation was led by Bobby Charlton and Geoff Hurst.
Brazil sent Carlos Alberto, Dunga, Ronaldo, and Zico for Tuesday's
presentation. But Pele has called the Brazilian effort unrealistic
and refused to participate. In fact, Brazil has no chance of
winning. Germany, which had the approval of UEFA before England
entered the picture after the 1996 European Championships, also
will make its bid Tuesday, led by Franz Beckenbauer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just another gimmick
</P>
<P>
   MLS is considering a two-referee, two-linesman system for next
season. This is neither the right place nor time for such an
experiment. FIFA is attempting to evaluate the system, and Italy
will try it during its Coppa Italia competition starting this
month. How it functions in Italy should provide reliable data for
possible future use, since the Italian game has evolved over
decades and its referees are considered among the best in the
world. But MLS has so many weaknesses and wrinkles as to render
such an experiment worthless. No reliable conclusions can be made
until the league solves its other major problems, or at least until
it has evolved past an embryonic stage. If the system were tried in
Mexico, at least some relevant data could be compiled. The Mexican
league is mature, a rich and secure enterprise with a distinct
playing style, plus consistency in administration, coaching, and
refereeing. The two-referee, two-linesman system would be wasted on
MLS. It will be perceived as a gimmick by casual observers and
anyone with an elementary understanding of experimentation.
Gimmicks already seem to be a priority in MLS, and until quality
and substance become paramount, the league will not make progress.

WE ALMOST HAD A SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the story of how America came within a hair trigger of
imposing realistic restrictions on the ownership of personal
arsenals. We didn't get so close because we got fed up with the
senseless slaughter on our streets. Nor was it because we grew
emotionally exhausted from the repeated episodes of 6-year-olds
accidentally gunning down their younger siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how it went:
</P>
<P>
   It began with a down day on Wall Street. The Dow plunged 180
points and a securities trader resorted to that peculiarly American
tonic for a bad day: a couple of handguns and a stroll through the
day-trading offices where he had lost his money. Afterward, nine
people lay on the carpet dead. We'd seen it before. We've had guns
massacre the innocent in our schoolyards, our restaurants, and our
homes. And nothing had ever been done.
</P>
<P>
   But this was different. This dangerous brew of falling stocks
and flying bullets was quick to spread. A month after its 180-point
drop, the Dow dipped 60 points and three people were mowed down at
a brokerage in Fort Lauderdale. The following week, when Martha
Stewart's IPO failed to measure up to expectations, blood gushed
through Cedar Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after that, Alan Greenspan, who had had bratwurst for
dinner the previous night, accidentally burped during his testimony
before Congress, and someone mistook the ``Urp'' for ``Up,'' which
was immediately misinterpreted as a forecast on the direction of
interest rates. The news flashed on Bloomberg screens across
America, stock prices swooned, and 16 people fell in a hail of
gunfire on the sidewalk in front of a Charles Schwab office in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Soon blood poured into the gutters with every quiver in the
market. No man woman or child was safe from the fluctuations of
Yahoo's stock price. Life expectancy dropped precipitiously for
employees of Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber, and Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   But then something else happened _ something far more chilling
than the wanton loss of life. As the blood rose above our hips,
climbing faster than Amazon.com once did, we lost our will to drive
the stock market higher. We knew that the slightest rise risked
another decline, and more spattering of our blood on walls and
windows and doors from Rochester to Eureka. Before we knew it true
horror struck: We had waded into the depths of the first bear
market in a generation. America had shot the market to death.
</P>
<P>
   After the market's demise, it wasn't long before the wheels of
commerce and industry ground to a halt. With blood in our hair,
blood on our shoes, blood beneath our fingernails, we had lost that
good old American spirit of buying and selling and buying and
buying and buying, and a long, brutal downturn ensued. Our magical
era of prosperity had collapsed before the barrel of a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Then _ and only then _ were voices raised in the corridors of
power to end the mayhem and the malaise. It was not warm and fuzzy
sentiment but cold economic reality that finally got Congress to
stand together behind a fearless leader and a promise to sweep up
the arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   The people were stirred. Hope filled the land. The guns were to
be seized, melted into a heap, and America was to get back to the
business of business.
</P>
<P>
   As momentum built for revolutionary change in America, the
fearless leader took the podium to proclaim a return to civilized
life, and a gunshot rang out, followed by another, and another _ so
many gunshots so fast it was impossible to count them _ and the
fearless leader fell fearlessly to his death.
</P>
<P>
   And no one stood up in his place.

<P>
   YORK, Maine _ A hot sun beats down on the crowded sands of York
Beach, where the air is fragrant with summer-at-the-seaside smells:
suntan lotion, the briny ocean, hot dogs with everything.
</P>
<P>
   Then another timeless summer scent comes through. It's saltwater
taffy, as it has been made for more than a century at the
Goldenrod, a seaside restaurant and candy shop that opened its
doors in 1896. Staff at the Goldenrod make ``Goldenrod Kisses'' in
front of a large plate-glass window _ boiling, pulling, rolling,
and cutting the taffy in full view of the street.
</P>
<P>
   As is invariably the case, this day a couple of little kids in
sandy bathing suits are pressing sunburned noses against the glass
chanting, ``Mommy, that smells good! I want some!'' They might not
realize it, but they are storing away a sensory memory of Maine
that may well bring them back, summer after summer, for the rest of
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Only a little over an hour's drive from Boston, York contains
all the attributes of coastal Maine that tourists often drive
another five hours or more _ to Bar Harbor and beyond _ to savor:
miles of sandy beaches and stretches of rocky cliff, lighthouses,
boat-filled coves and harbors, lobster pounds and seafood
restaurants, beachside amusement arcades, artists and galleries,
turreted grand hotels and ma-and-pa campgrounds, ship captains'
mansions and grand summer homes. And, of course, saltwater taffy
like the one your grandparents shared on their first visit to
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   In packing all this in, it helps that there is a lot of York.
The town, in fact, is divided into an almost bewildering number of
distinct villages and sections, including York Corners, York
Village, York Harbor, York Beach, and Cape Neddick. Samuel Clemens
(better known as Mark Twain) who frequently summered in southern
Maine, once observed that in York, ``It is difficult to throw a
brick in any one direction without danger of disabling a
postmaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Locals refer to this confederation of villages and hamlets
simply as ``The Yorks.'' That's also how it's marked by signposts
from Interstate 95 and Route 1. In summer, an open-sided trolley
circles the town, making several stops in each village. (A local
ride is $1.50, an hourlong narrated tour $3.)
</P>
<P>
   York insists that it's the oldest town in Maine, a claim
fiercely disputed by neighboring Kittery. Whatever the merits of
the rival claims, York Village or Old York was founded in 1630 and,
with its 17th-century burial ground and early colonial buildings,
certainly looks the part.
</P>
<P>
   The Old York Historical Society (207-363-4974) maintains seven
restored buildings in the heart of the village. The society's
visitors' center is in Jefferds Tavern (1759), just off York Street
(Route 1A). Nearby is the Old Gaol (1719), supposedly the oldest
remaining public building in the former English colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibits in the Old Gaol, or jail, tell the dramatic story of
York's early years, in which numerous Native American attacks and a
massacre in which several hundred settlers died. The historical
society runs a gift shop on York Street and also organizes frequent
walking tours and special events. A ticket good for admission to
all the society's properties is $7 for adults and $3 for children.
</P>
<P>
   If you enjoy a good fright of an evening, Ghostly Tours
(207-363-0000) offers candlelit walks through the village led by a
hooded storyteller ($6 per person). There's also a candlelit ``Jail
Break'' tour of the Old Gaol's dungeons and cells, complete with
stories about escapes from them ($4 adults, $2 children).
</P>
<P>
   A mile-long walking trail, ``The Fisherman's Path,'' runs from
behind the George Marshall Store, a former ship chandler's in York
Village, to York Harbor. The trail follows the York River, passing
through Steedman Woods and crossing ``The Wiggly Bridge,'' an
engagingly shaky suspension bridge.
</P>
<P>
   York Harbor's heyday was in the last decades of the 19th
century, when yachtsmen and other well-to-do city folk began
flocking to the Maine coast, building ``cottages'' ranging from
unpretentious to imposing or spending weeks ``rusticating'' in
rambling resort hotels. Today, it still looks much as it did then
with old wooden boats at anchor in the harbor and dignified summer
homes lining narrow lanes. Some of the old cottages are now B &AMP; Bs,
however, and the Stage Neck Inn resort stands on the site of
Marshall House, York Harbor's pioneer hotel.
</P>
<P>
   A fine example of a ship owner's antique-filled 18th-century
mansion is the Sayward-Wheeler House on Barrell Lane in York
Harbor, maintained by the Society for the Preservation of New
England Antiquities (603-436-3205). Admission is $4 for adults, $2
for children.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to get out on the water and learn about lobsterin',
Captain Tom Harmon (a retired high school science teacher) takes up
to six people with him on his lobster boat as he checks traps and
hauls in crustaceans. Harmon departs from the Town Dock in York
Harbor hourly from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Friday. The
charge is $7.50 per person. (For information or reservations, call
207-363-3234).
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary working folk discovered Maine in the last century, too,
and York Beach _ a so-called streetcar resort _ was developed to
accommodate them. In contrast to adjacent York Harbor, the cottages
here are mostly small, modest, and close together; there are also
two tent and trailer parks. York Beach isn't fancy, but it's
friendly and still looks and feels like a Victorian family resort.
</P>
<P>
   There are actually two beaches, Long Beach and Short Sands, both
broad, sandy, and facing the open Atlantic. Long Beach is
particularly noted for its surfing. The York Parks and Recreation
Department (207-363-1040) rents kayaks at the beach for $10 an hour
or $25 for a full day.
</P>
<P>
   In between the beaches is Nubble Point and just off the point,
on its own little island, is Nubble Light. This lighthouse, which
has a red-roofed keeper's house attached, is arguably the most
photographed in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At the tip of Nubble Point is a small public park with a parking
area, restrooms, and an information center. Here, too, is Fox's
Lobster House, which serves lobsters every way from basic boiled to
baked stuffed and deep fried, and has a great view of both the
ocean and the lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Another gustatory attraction on Nubble Point is Brown's Old
Fashioned Ice Cream, a small stand with a large parking lot for the
hordes of ice cream lovers it attracts. A perennially popular
flavor is wild blueberry; the newest offering is Y2K _ French
vanilla, with chocolate, peanut butter, and malted milk balls mixed
in .
</P>
<P>
   York Beach's dining and entertainment hub is at Short Sands.
It's an old-fashioned scene, featuring a boardwalk lined with
arcades, souvenir shops, beachware boutiques, and hot dog stands.
Like the Goldenrod, most of the buildings date from around the turn
of the century.
</P>
<P>
   A block from the beach is York's Wild Kingdom (207-363-4911),
the largest zoo and amusement park in southern Maine and home to
the state's only white Bengal tiger. Other attractions include
elephant rides, an 18-hole miniature golf course, a carousel, and a
petting zoo. A combination zoo admission and amusement park ticket
is $13.75 for adults, $9.75 for children age 4 to 10, and $3.75 for
children 3 and under.
</P>
<P>
   The village of Cape Neddick, just north of York Beach along
Shore Road (Route 1A), clusters around a small, sheltered cove
where lobster boats anchor. The Cape Neddick Lobster Pound has an
attractive dining room and an outside deck, both looking out on the
water.
</P>
<P>
   Besides beaches and coastline, York also has its own mountain:
Mount Agamenticus, the name of the original Native American
settlement. Agamenticus is only 580 feet high but locals boast that
it's the highest hill on the Atlantic seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   A ski slope at one time, Mount Agamenticus is now a town park,
with both a paved road and a hiking trail leading to the summit.
The park and recreation department rents mountain bikes from its
office on Church Street in York Beach, $15 for a half day, $20 for
a full day. Agamenticus Riding Stables (207-361-2840), located at
the summit, charges $25 for a one-hour trail ride, $40 for a
two-hour one.
</P>
<P>
   There is a fine view down the coast in both directions from the
summit of Agamenticus. It may not be quite as spectacular as that
from the Bar Harbor area's Cadillac Mountain, but it's not bad. And
it's only about an hour away.
</P>
<P>
   To reach The Yorks from Boston, take Interstate 95 north to Exit
4 and follow signs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yorks Chamber of Commerce visitors center, attractively
housed in a replica of a classic York Harbor cottage, is on Route
1, directly across from the entrance to the I-95 connector. For
information about the area stop by, call 207-363-7320, or visit

GOING FOR THE GOLD AT THE COUNTRY CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A businessman gushed recently over breakfast about the
``exuberance of corporate spending.'' He wasn't talking about the
thrill of eating an egg-white-only omelette on someone else's
expense account. He was talking about the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In its narrowest definition, the Ryder Cup is about golf. What
golfers, from hackers to pros, consider the sport's premiere
tournament will be played at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass.
in September.
</P>
<P>
   But don't let the narrow definition blind you to a larger
reality. The Ryder Cup is about much more than poking little white
balls onto perfectly groomed greens. It's a prime illustration of
the exclusionary power of the corporate elite and how it chooses to
spend its money. It also vividly depicts today's sports-driven
culture and value system. Does that sound overly dramatic? Consider
this:
</P>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup could generate as much as $150 million in direct
and indirect spending, according to Patrick B. Moscaritolo,
president and CEO of the Greater Boston Convention and Visitors
Bureau. If it does, it won't beat the 100th running of the Boston
Marathon in 1996, which generated close to $170 million. But here's
a key distinction. The 1996 marathon was a true people's event.
There were 38,000 runners, 10,000 from outside the United States.
One million men, women, and children lined the route. As individual
participants and fans, they spent millions on food, hotels,
souvenirs, and other items.
</P>
<P>
   Money generated by the Ryder Cup is almost exclusively the
product of high-end corporate spending. The Massachusetts Port
Authority is worried about running out of landing space for all the
corporate jets due to fly into town for the event. Golf courses
within a 40- to 50-mile radius of Boston will be leased by
corporations who want to provide their clients with the best
possible golf experience during their Ryder Cup stay.
</P>
<P>
   From tables to tents, the pricetag for claiming a slice of
coveted turf on The Country Club course ranges from $50,000 to
$500,000. Clients who receive treasured tickets will watch the
tournament in air-conditioned comfort. For $275 more, they'll have
butler service. As they watch the best in golf drive, chip, and
putt, the lucky can order smoked salmon platters, iced micro brews,
``first tier'' Chardonnay, shrimp, and sushi. Gross revenue will be
about $63 million. The PGA will net an estimated $16.5 million. The
Country Club should net $5 million to $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   To state the obvious, the sports world is a big-money world, and
corporations are eager to participate. But how exuberant are they
when it comes to sharing their wealth with those outside their
circle?
</P>
<P>
   Basically, it is up to the local host to force the sports
industry and its corporate support base to reach out to the
community and the ordinary fan. Mayor Thomas M. Menino, for
example, seized the moment during the recent Major League Baseball
All-Star Game with the staging of a City Hall Plaza celebration
that drew a crowd of 30,000. The John Hancock Fanfest drew 110,000
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sending the message out to professional sports that
there has to be a side for the general public,'' says Menino.
They're the ones out there supporting it, day in and day out. Their
allegiance doesn't depend on the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   The Country Club is donating 300 Ryder Cup tickets to the City
of Boston. The city, in turn, is looking to sell what it calls
``Franklin Park Corporate Packages'' to create a $1 million
endowment for sports programs for city youth. One table costs
$55,000. Ten of 30 tables remain to be sold.
</P>
<P>
   The Town of Brookline is also getting $3 million from The
Country Club. But Brookline's effort to stage a 10-day ``golf
experience'' similar to the Hancock Fanfest has so far been
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   A Southborough, Mass. company, Corporate Communications Inc.,
won a bid in May to stage the event. But it could not raise the
$500,000 it needed from corporate underwriters, according to
company spokesman Bob Dobinski. The corporate money was already
committed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town is committed to providing a community celebration for
the Ryder Cup,'' says Dobinski, who is now looking for corporate
backing for a scaled-down, one-day event.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball and golf are very different sports with appeals to very
different audiences. Still, golf is increasing in popularity.
Especially for baby boomers, it's a good way to do business. The
knees are going fast, ruling out pickup basketball games and
tennis. Besides, it's hard to close a deal when you are on the
gallop and gasping for air. A golf course offers fresh air, a
modicum of exercise, and a civilized way to entertain clients.
</P>
<P>
   The world of golf is expanding, but it has a long way to go
before it has the kind of critical mass to force change and a
broader social conscience onto privately run tournaments like the
Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime _ smoked salmon, anyone?

<P>
   AGAWAM, Mass. _ As authorities investigate a weekend water-ride
accident at Riverside Amusement Park, a digital-age drive for the
fastest, tallest, longest, or roughest ride is feeding competition
for the ultimate attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it's pretty much an all-out war between the parks
to try to build the highest and most intense rides,'' said David
Escalante of American Coaster Enthusiasts, a Kansas-based
hobbyists' group. ``That's the number one thing that is attracting
their customers.''
</P>
<P>
   While strongly defending its safety record, Riverside Park's
operator said Monday it has closed 17 water-rafting rides in its
parks nationwide in response to Saturday's accident on a thrill
ride here. Eight people were hurt, one man critically.
</P>
<P>
   The US Consumer Product Safety Commission, in a report last
month, said injuries on amusement park rides are rising sharply,
sending 9,200 people to emergency rooms for treatment last year, up
from 7,400 in 1994 _ a 24 percent spike that outpaces increased
park attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'd be naive to say they're not competing for a group
of people who want to try out everything,'' said Lowell Gratigny, a
senior vice president at American Specialty Insurance Services, an
amusement park risk management firm based in Indiana. ``They want
the quickest or the highest. They're in the entertainment business
and that's what makes the folks come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for those thrills turned to instant terror around
9:30 Saturday night when the 2-month-old Blizzard River ride,
touted by the park as ``more than 1,400 feet of bends and
bottlenecks,'' plunged its patrons into the water in a capsized
raft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like we were lost forever,'' said Kimberly Pescaro, 27.
``As we bumped along the bottom every now and then we would hit
little air pockets and I would be able to stretch my head back and
grab a breath of air ... We were strapped in our seats, upside-down
in the water. All I could think of was that I would never see my
8-month-old son again.''
</P>
<P>
   Pescaro, of Shrewsbury, suffered a concussion on the ride in
which passengers float down the shallow, artificial river in large
round rafts propelled by the force of the churning water. Her
husband, Jerry, needed several stitches for a cut in his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Six other rafters were taken to Baystate Medical Center in
Springfield. John Pascone of Dayville, Conn., was in critical
condition Monday. His 9-year-old daughter, Angelica, and 4-year-old
son, Jonathan, were in fair condition. His wife, Kimberly was
treated and released on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Messier, 27, of Coventry, R.I., was in serious condition
Monday at Baystate. Her husband, Ernest, 32, was treated and
released. John and Jonathan Pascone and Susan Messier were admitted
for near-drowning. Angelica Pascone was admitted with a right
shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   Park operators called the accident ``unfortunate'' and promised
a rigorous review.
</P>
<P>
   While local building officials are responsible for checking the
safety of amusement park rides, inspectors from the state
Department of Public Safety are assisting local police and
engineers hired by the park to determine what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be very deliberate in our approach to this
examination therefore there is not a timetable for us to arrive at
the conclusion,'' said Brent Gooden, a spokesman for Premier Parks,
which owns and operates Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden said the 17 rides ordered shut down nationwide by the
company were made by various manufacturers. The company operates
parks from California to Georgia, New Jersey to Colorado, including
all of the Six Flags parks.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's accident was the second this year involving a
water raft ride at a Premier-operated park.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a woman was killed and 10 people were hurt when a
similar raft carrying 12 people capsized on the Roaring Rapids ride
at Premier's Six Flags Over Texas park. In that case, an
investigation found that five of the 12 inflatable ``bladders'' had
lost air pressure, causing them to ride low in the water _ one in a
series of ``extraordinary'' events that park officials said caused
the fatal mishap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six Flags delivers 1.5 billion safe rides a year and our
roller coasters will travel the equivalent of 70 orbits around the
Earth in a season and carry roughly 140 million riders,'' said
Gooden, who called amusement parks safer than water skiing or a
swim in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But William J. Buckley, the US editor of First Drop, a
London-based magazine that focuses on thrill rides and new
technologies, said the race for the big thrill is pushing some
parks too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really surprised to see this happen,'' said Buckley,
who is based in Maynard. ``There have been other instances of this
accident just this year. I think you're going to see sweeping
changes in the industry in regard to the design and fabrication of
this ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley believes competition from other nearby water rides was
among the factors that contributed to Riverside Park's decision to
add the Blizzard River ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend in the industry is to make these wetter rides with
taller, wetter waves,'' Buckley said. ``A good river rapid ride is
judged on just how completely soaked you can get its guests.
Basically, it's not even healthy competition. It's rabid
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Malman, a Denver attorney representing a Colorado woman
who said she lost her memory on a roller coaster at Six Flags
Elitch Gardens park, said today's amusement parks are simply
misnomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're raising the stakes by making them more and more
dangerous,'' Malman said. ``Everyone's going after that dollar and
therefore they have to make them more thrilling. They argue that
there's a very small minority of people who get hurt so there's
nothing they can do about it. And, unfortunately, juries tend to
believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   John Graff, president of the International Association of
Amusement Parks and Attractions, an Alexandria, Va.-based trade
group, blamed the recent US Consumer Product Safety Commission
statistics showing a jump in accidents on a change in reporting
methods that his group is working to correct.
</P>
<P>
   Graff said it's natural that parks promote the superlatives of
their rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's certainly the way to market, sure,'' he said. ``You say
you've got the tallest roller coaster in the world or something.
But you usually only get to claim that for about a month before
somebody else puts in another loop or goes you one better.''
</P>
<P>
   And at Riverside Park Monday, the search for a thrilling ride
was still ringing the cash registers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love 'em. The more danger the better,'' said Bob Rouillier,
a charter bus driver from Pawtucket, R.I. ``It takes you to the
peak ... you know that thrill, that peak of the rush. I don't feel
like I'm going to be harmed. One accident out of how many rides?''

ARMY RETREATS ON WETLANDS PROTECTION, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite President Clinton's promise to stop the destruction of
the nation's wetlands, the US Army Corps of Engineers is rapidly
retreating from enforcing the main law that protects streams,
swamps, and marshes from filling and development, a review of the
Corps' records indicates.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps, one of two main federal agencies charged with
protecting wetlands, has slashed inspections for possible
violations by 40 percent since 1992, and in 1998 rejected only 3.2
percent of permit applications for major wetland projects. In 1992,
the Corps turned down 8.8 percent of such applications, according
to the documents.
</P>
<P>
   Beset by Congressional budget freezes as well as a headquarters
goal of greater fairness to developers, Corps employees say they
feel pressured to process applications quickly and, in at least one
field office, they received a memo urging them to avoid
time-consuming, costly enforcement actions.
</P>
<P>
   Even in New England, regarded as one of the more vigilant Corps
offices, the Corps regulatory budget has been frozen at $4.7
million since 1995, forcing staff reductions from 67 to 55. During
that period, wetland-filling applications increased by 8 percent as
the region's economy prospered.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Corps officials acknowledge that inspections and
enforcement actions have dropped, but they say that partly reflects
a society becoming sensitive to the need to protect wetlands, so
there are fewer attempts to damage them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they say the cutbacks reflect five years of budget
freezes that have reduced the Corps regulatory staff from 1,150 to
1,050, forcing the agency to be more efficient, avoiding minor
issues and allowing state regulators to do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we've substantially increased environmental
protection over the past 10 years,'' said John Studet, chief of the
headquarters regulatory branch of the Corps.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Employees critical
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Corps employees say the agency has become so averse to
enforcing regulations _ and so quick to issue permits _ that it has
become a paper tiger easy to take advantage of.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Corps is withdrawing its presence in enforcement,'' said
Magi Shapiro of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility,
who quit the Corps' Richmond office in 1996 rather than approve
developments she felt should have been turned down. ``A program
without enforcement is an invitation to break the law without
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The whistleblower organization, a seven-year-old advocacy group
for government employees concerned about environmental issues,
provided the Globe with summaries of enforcement records and other
documents obtained from the Corps' 37 field offices under the
Freedom of Information Act after employees complained of a
precipitous drop in wetland protection at the Corps.
</P>
<P>
   Grady McCallie, wetland ecologist for the National Wildlife
Federation, said the Corps' enforcement decline could spell doom
for thousands of acres of wetlands, especially in states that do
not have strong enforcement programs. He said New England states
generally have good state enforcement, but, even there, a tough
Corps can help stand up to powerful industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could start a program from scratch, I certainly wouldn't
organize it the way it is. But given where we are, we would be in
real bad shape'' if the Corps stops enforcing the law, McCallie
said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the Corps occurs as the federal government
tries to reverse centuries of destruction of wetlands, which are
nursery and kitchen for countless plants and animals. Americans
destroyed nearly 30 percent of all wetlands before realizing that
these swamps and marshes protect humans, too, by absorbing
floodwaters and trapping pollutants that might otherwise reach tap
water.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton steps in
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The United States still loses more than 100,000 acres a year of
wetlands, but Clinton hopes to reverse the trend by 2005, creating
100,000 acres more than are destroyed. The main tool would be the
restoration of wetlands that were damaged in the past, such as the
Florida Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, however, puts modest resources into the two
agencies charged with protecting wetlands that exist: the Corps of
Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency, which together
share responsibility for enforcing the federal Clean Water Act that
governs wetland development.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has only 26 people nationwide in its technical wetland
enforcement division, including one full-time employee based in
Boston. At the Corps, Clinton has repeatedly asked for $11 million
more for regulation of wetlands than the $106 million approved by
Congress this year, a reflection of conservatives' belief that the
Corps is often an obstacle to development.
</P>
<P>
   However, even if the White House received more money, Clinton
does not plan to beef up enforcement significantly. Almost half of
the extra money would fund a new appeal system to allow businesses
and individuals to challenge Corps decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the Corps' budget problems, the agency is far less
comfortable in the enforcer role than the EPA. The Corps, best
known as the builder of public works and flood control projects,
objected to regulating wetlands when the Clean Water Act passed in
1972 and, in recent years, the agency seldom goes to court because
of a violation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in addition to few fines and lawsuits, the Corps has also
cut back on other kinds of enforcement, according to the Public
Employees for Environmental Responsibility review. Orders to
restore illegally damaged wetlands have fallen from 283 to 109
since 1992, while field inspections have dropped from 8,149 to
5,141 in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a matter of time before people find out,'' one Corps
employee said. ``What's the use of getting a permit if people can
do it without a permit?''
</P>
<P>
   A memo for Corps employees in Salt Lake City, obtained by the
whistleblowers, even issued guidelines for what enforcement cases
to avoid. According to the memo, Corps officials ``will normally do
nothing further'' if they cannot determine from the office that a
reported violation is substantial. Even with some major violations,
the memo urges the Corps to ``end its involvement with the case''
if another agency will not take over.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Work overload
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New England Corps officials received no such memo, but the
office has eliminated its separate enforcement division and begun
transferring more cases to the EPA Boston office, which is
overwhelmed with more than 200 tips a year to be investigated by
one full-time and one part-time staff member.
</P>
<P>
   But Studet of the Corps said the workload shift to the EPA makes
sense because the EPA has broader enforcement powers, a bigger
legal team, and a formal agreement with the Corps to handle
prosecution of flagrant cases.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, Studet says critics' fixation on enforcement
overlooks big improvements at the Corps. For instance, he said the
Corps has toughened regulations since 1996, requiring that wetland
damage as small as one-third of an acre receive a Corps permit,
three times smaller than the previous minimum size.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the Corps has greatly increased the requirement
that developers offset damage to wetlands by creating new ones.
Last year, the Corps ordered 47,000 acres of new wetlands, which is
more than the 31,000 acres they allowed to be damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Clinton) goal is 100,000 acres gain by 2005. Our part of
that is that we believe we should continue to administer the
program so we have no net loss'' of wetlands, Studet said.
</P>
<P>
   However, researchers have cast doubt on the value of wetlands
created by developers: A University of Massachusetts study shows
half of them fail. Moreover, critics note, the wetland damage
Studet cites does not include illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of Corps
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility
said the underlying problem is that the Corps is so afraid of
controversy it bends over backward for powerful industries. Even in
the Concord office of the Corps, which the whistleblowers agree is
more vigilant than others, they found evidence of yielding to
political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Whistleblowers point to an internal Corps memo in which one
Corps official boasted that the agency has done little to slow the
rapid growth of the powerful cranberry industry in Maine, which has
lobbied Congress for easier rules to allow flooding wetlands for
the crop. The memo notes that all 29 permits had been promptly
granted and that only one grower had to create new wetlands to
offset the damage.
</P>
<P>
   New England regulatory chief William Lawless counters that each
project received proper review before it was approved, saying
critics ``are rushing to judgment. We certainly were knowledgeable
that the state was interested in cranberries, but that doesn't mean
we are going to roll over. We are very careful not to give special
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Lawless said, his office has done its best to keep up
wetland protection even as budget freezes forced him to eliminate
12 positions during the last four years. ``We're doing more with
less,'' he said.

CARROLL EXTENSION MAY BE TOO MUCH OF A STRETCH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   My name is Pete Carroll. I am the head coach of the New England
Patriots. I am not worried about being fired this season. Fired?
Please. What I really want to know is this: When do I get my
contract extended?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that's what I was thinking before we began this
conversation. Lately I've been contemplating an ultimatum meeting
with my boss, Bob Kraft, at his office. (He likes me to call him
``Robert,'' but he's Bob today with me. I'm in that kind of mood.
Don't mess with me.)
</P>
<P>
   His secretary will ask if I have an appointment. I'll say I
don't need one. I'll walk into the office and sit in the boss's
favorite chair. I'll boldly take a sip of his coffee, prop my feet
on his desk, and tell him to have a seat and listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extend my original five-year contract or fire me now,'' I'll
say. I'll feel good when I say it. I've been quiet too long.
</P>
<P>
   I've had this job for two seasons and for two seasons I've had
no true job security, despite my contract. You could call me ``Head
Man Sulking.'' I'm the Ron Mercer of football coaches, always
rumored to be going somewhere else. I've been a coach for three
seasons and been in the playoffs two of them. When my team makes
the playoffs this year, I will become the first coach in Patriots
history to lead a team to the postseason three consecutive seasons.
Bill Parcells never did that, OK?
</P>
<P>
   ``You heard me correctly, Bob-o,'' I'll say. ``Extend or
dismiss.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be my third straight season with a different starting
running back. My middle linebacker, Ted Johnson, had a right biceps
injury in '98; he has a left biceps injury in '99. I've got guys on
my team who still look to Parcells for approval after they make a
play against the Jets. You want to talk about fired? I wish I could
fire those guys. I went into the last two games of '98 with Scott
Zolak as my starting quarterback. Hey, I know you're not a coach.
But let's say you were. Would you have Zolak as your starter if you
needed to win one of two games to get you to the playoffs? I love
Zo, but come on.
</P>
<P>
   My team was humiliated by the Jets in the last game of '98. In
the first game of '99, we were crushed by the Jaguars in the
playoffs. That's when I discovered that my office is not really
based in Foxborough; it's more like Alcatraz. My bosses left me on
an island for weeks before saying that my job was safe. I heard
they were fascinated by Jets assistant Bill Belichick. Why would
you want to hire a guy who publicly admits to being a Jon Bon Jovi
fan?
</P>
<P>
   I have some different assistants this year because some were
fired. And it's going to be hard for me to recruit others when they
don't know what my job status is. That's why I'm going to visit the
boss. I want to make things clear. I am tired of hearing about The
Tuna and his transcendent talks with the media. I am tired of
writers and fans speaking in puns about me, saying things like,
``Carroll will be going bye-bye in the Patriots' bye week.'' I am
tired of the mixed messages. I am criticized for not being tough
with the players, but at one point last season players were able to
go to management and evaluate me.
</P>
<P>
   I'm an angry man right now. I've been too good of a company man.
So much so that people forget that Pete Carroll was an exceptional
defensive coordinator in his day (I always wanted to be like an
athlete and speak in the third person).
</P>
<P>
   And let's say my team does go 7-9 this year. Does that make me a
bad coach? A 7-9 season would give me a career record of 33-33.
Parcells, one of the greatest coaches of all time, was 36-27-1 in
his first four years. He also won a Super Bowl in his fourth year,
but remember that he was 3-12-1 in his first season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting ridiculous around here,'' I'll say, borrowing a
quote from Lawyer Milloy. I'll finish the coffee and tell Bob to
get me a refill, no cream. ``I demand to be given an extra year on
my deal, just to compensate for all my aggravation.''
</P>
<P>
   You think I am foolish. But I've got leverage. No way Kraft
fires me now. It is Aug. 10. He knows firing me before the first
preseason game would distract from the season. How can you fire a
coach during training camp? Plus, if he did fire me now, he would
have a hard time getting a big-time coach in here. They would all
wonder about him, not me. I've got leverage, baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I want our extension to be in writing. In clear English,''
I'll say. ``None of this `Memorandum of Understanding' stuff that
John Rowland signed for Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   I can see Kraft looking with increased interest now. The mention
of Rowland has reminded him of his new stadium in Foxborough. He
already has some trailer park residents giving him resistance. He
doesn't need resistance right now from anyone. He will give in. He
will give me my new deal. I deserve it. He knows Pete Carroll goes
out there and gets the job done and gives 110 percent because Pete
Carroll loves the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Pete,'' he'll say to me after a long pause, ``why didn't
you tell me you felt this way? I would have done something a long
time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes. Peace of mind and a new contract. Finally.
</P>
<P>
   I can see Kraft reaching into his desk to pull out a slip of
paper with my name already on it. The slip is pink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, Robert?'' I'll say, taking my feet down from the desk.
``Now that I've had time to think about it, contract extensions are
overrated.''
</P>

RATINGS IN SUMMER AREN'T SO HOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's no wonder television executives resort to
pay-for-television events to boost ratings during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend offered ample evidence. With the exception of the
Red Sox, not one event captured significant ratings numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA? Saturday's game pulled a .39, Sunday's a .82. That's a
little more than 1 ratings point combined, or a total of 22,000
households.
</P>
<P>
   The Major League Soccer match between the Mutiny and United
Sunday earned a .7.
</P>
<P>
   Yippee.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox pulled a 6.2 on Channel 25 Saturday, and considering
the great weather that day, it is a considerable achievement.
</P>
<P>
   But not all reliable sports can put up the numbers all the time.
The American Bowl, a football game featuring the Denver Broncos
against the San Diego Chargers Saturday night, netted only a 2.69
rating on Channel 25, just about what the Brickyard 400 auto race
got on Channel 5 that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Out of sight
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's Red Sox game against the Anaheim Angels was not
televised because of the exclusive deal between ESPN and Major
League Baseball that prohibits broadcasts of any game on Sunday
nights except the one on ESPN. The Angels could have moved the

   CNN/SI interviewed two of the most maligned and misunderstood
players talking about their induction into the Pro Football Hall of
Fame. ``I am in the Hall of Fame regardless,'' Lawrence Taylor said
on CNN/SI's ``Page One.'' ``Whether you like me or not, every time
you visit that place you are going to see my face inside that
building.'' It's not a pretty face. George Martin, who played with
LT, said, ``A transformation would take place when he'd put on his
uniform. He would be transformed into this homicidal maniac.''
Taylor's former coach, Bill Parcells, was able to handle the
transformation. ``He's the greatest player I ever coached,''
Parcells told CNN/SI. ``I really love him with all of my heart. I
really do. And it's just like he's like one of my own kids. When he
starts with his hands, he's lying. If he talks straight, he's
telling the truth. If you see him when he starts to emphasize
something, he's not telling you the truth. See, that's something I
know about him, that he doesn't even know that I know.'' Eric
Dickerson's thoughts on the Hall of Fame were similar to Taylor's.
``No matter what people or the media think,'' Dickerson said, ``I
didn't do it perfect, but I did do it right.'' . . . CNN/SI will
have nightly highlight shows from the 81st PGA Championship nightly
at 8:30 and 11:30. It starts coverage with a preview special
Wednesday hosted by Johnny Phelps and Bobby Clampett. The
late-night shows will not air on Saturday and Sunday . . . CBS and
TNT will share coverage of golf's fourth major, a combined 28 hours
worth. TNT provides early-round coverage Thursday and Friday from
1-7 p.m. and picks up play Saturday and Sunday from 10:30 a.m.-1
p.m. CBS has the final two rounds on Saturday and Sunday from
1:30-6:30 p.m. Jim Nantz and Ken Venturi host CBS's coverage.

famous sokaiya who was recently released from jail. But now even he
is turning to other lines of business and seeking to soften his

DATA GENERAL SALE ENDS ERA OF HIGH-TECH GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And then there were none.
</P>
<P>
   Data General Corp., the last high-tech titan from the glory days
of the Massachusetts Miracle, agreed to be sold Monday for $1.05
billion to EMC Corp., a bigger and better focused competitor in the
dull but booming business of computer data storage.
</P>
<P>
   Like Wang Laboratories Inc., Digital Equipment Corp., and Prime
Computer Inc. before it, Data General struggled and ultimately
failed to pull off one of high technology's most demanding feats:
reinventing itself.
</P>
<P>
   Those four thrived on the high-tech edge when minicomputers used
by businesses were the hot new machines of the early 1980s. When
technology moved on to embrace the personal computer, they were
unable to come up with a compelling second act.
</P>
<P>
   Prime gave up the ghost a decade ago, selling out to a venture
capital firm to avoid a hostile suitor. Digital and Wang tried to
embrace the service economy, building maintenance and consulting
businesses that catered to customers that already owned computer
systems. They have both been sold in the last 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   Data General, the company and creative culture featured in Tracy
Kidder's Pulitzer Prize-winning book ``The Soul of a New Machine,''
stuck to hardware and tried to build a place in a new high-tech
niche.
</P>
<P>
   It found neither success nor outright failure making computer
network servers and storage devices. The company's sales remained
stubbornly stuck at about $1 billion a year for more than a decade.
Data General wouldn't die but couldn't seem to grow. Finally,
Monday, it was time to cash in and sell the business to a new
generation technology leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, they could never get away from that billion-dollar
level,'' said Barry Fidelman, once a Data General executive in the
company's heyday and now a venture capitalist based in Boston.
``This is the way the story somehow had to end.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the way the story often ends. For an industry shaken so
regularly by revolutionary change, high technology produces
strikingly few adaptable companies.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and computer industry veterans say companies don't
change for a handful of reasons. First, there are only so many
great new ideas unspoiled by established competition.
</P>
<P>
   And companies that have made a name for themselves in one field
simply resist moves into a new business. The best talent, and a
company's resources, remain glued to the corporate bread and
butter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they're doing well they feel they don't need to reinvent
themselves, and when they're doing poorly they feel they can't
afford to,'' said David Hill of the Aberdeen Group, a high-tech
consulting firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Computer revolutions also have a habit of crushing the
profitability of old business models, grinding down the percentage
of every sales dollar a company keeps after expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The minicomputers designed by Data General, Digital Equipment,
and Prime were once a dramatically cheaper and more flexible
alternative to big mainframe computers.
</P>
<P>
   Then something even more flexible and inexpensive arrived _ the
PC. And it practically ran the minicomputer out of business. Now,
the Internet poses similar threats to software companies whose
products run on personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   There is no end to the list of companies that made a name and a
fortune on one generation of technology and didn't want to let go
of the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Digital, once the world's second-largest computer maker, tried
its own line of personal computers in 1984 and failed miserably.
Digital was initially reluctant to give its own personal computers
full support from the very top in 1984 and the high-tech world
raced by. The ultimate irony: Digital was purchased last year by a
leading personal computer maker, Compaq Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts argue that Data General missed opportunities to
exploit early technical advantages and own early leadership roles
in products like laptop computers and electronic messaging.
</P>
<P>
   But it did develop computer storage technology that was widely
respected, and data storage has become a fast-growing industry. The
problem was that Data General didn't get there first.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that have to compete against an established leader
face an uphill battle. They often must persuade big clients to dump
the equipment and systems already purchased from the industry
leader to make headway, dislodging the so-called ``installed
base.''
</P>
<P>
   EMC is the leader in storage, and it is getting more competition
from very big competitors like IBM Corp. Data General didn't have
the firepower to compete on their level.
</P>
<P>
   Rare as they are, a few technology companies have made
successful leaps to new businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp. was locked in hopeless price competition for
computer memory years ago when it evolved into the world leader of
processing microchips, the ``Intel inside'' personal computer
microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard Co. was another minicomputer manufacturer in the
1980s, but it moved successfully into computer printers and other
products. The company could adapt because it was a more diversified
business from the start, organized and culturally atuned to change
with the times.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe Microsoft Corp.'s abrupt move into the
Internet in the late 1990s will be seen one day as an astute
business decision. Money generated by Microsoft's Internet ventures
are a drop in the bucket compared to the profits from its Windows
computer operating software, but that could change.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is taking precisely the path many declining companies
failed to choose years ago: moving seriously into a new technology
with paltry profit margins compared to those of its very fat cash
cow.
</P>
<P>
   EMC is another technology company at the very cutting edge of
its field, just like Data General, Digital, Prime Computer, and
Wang years before.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be able to change when the time comes?

TOP GROUP NOW A TRIO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be a perfecta, with trainers D. Wayne Lukas, who was
inducted into the Hall of Fame Monday, and Bob Baffert dominating
the national scene. But after the last two weekends, it has become
a trifecta, as Elliott Walden joined the list.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1, Walden saddled 4-year-old Victory Gallop to a triumph
in the Whitney Handicap at Saratoga, and Victory Gallop now has a
legitimate chance to be handicap champion and Horse of the Year.
Last Sunday, Walden went over the top with his 3-year-olds, as
first Ecton Park won the Jim Dandy at The Spa, and then Menifee
captured the $1 million Haskell Invitational at Monmouth. Many
observers think Menifee, who was second to Charismatic in both the
Kentucky Derby and Preakness before running a poor eighth in the
Belmont Stakes, is the best of the sophomores. Menifee may go on to
prove them right.
</P>
<P>
   Walden, 36, was born in Lexington, Ky. His late father, Ben Sr.,
was a consummate horseman, and his brother, Ben Jr., is also in the
business. Walden, who started as a groom, worked for LeRoy Jolley,
Dennis Ebert, and John Gosden before taking out his own license in
1985. Walden was long known as a top trainer at Churchill Downs,
but emerged into the spotlight only when Victory Gallop ran second
to Real Quiet in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness in 1998, then
took the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   In the Haskell, Menifee defeated Cat Thief, trained by Lukas, by
a half-length, and Cat Thief was, in turn, a half-length in front
of Forestry, trained by Baffert. A son of Harlon, out of a Never
Bend mare, Menifee sports a career record of 9-5-3-0, and has more
than $1.5 million in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the true Menifee who showed up today,'' said Walden.
``It's great to see him back in top form after the disappointing
Belmont. If he comes back well, we'll go to Saratoga for the
Travers (Aug. 28).''
</P>
<P>
   Ecton Park is one heck of a second-stringer. The son of Forty
Niner, out of a Danzig mare, enjoys outstanding breeding for a wet
track, and he relished the slop at Saratoga, beating Belmont Stakes
winner Lemon Drop Kid by more than 6 lengths. Ecton Park finished
12th in the Derby, and Walden pulled him off the Triple Crown
trail. He has a lifetime mark of 10-4-3-2, and has won nearly
$500,000 in purses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been hoping to win a graded stakes with him,'' said
owner Mark Stanley. ``I had no idea how he would run over the mud.
He had never run over it. It seems like he liked it. I think he
might go next in the Pennsylvania Derby (Sept. 6 at Philadelphia
Park), and then the Super Derby (Oct. 2 at Louisiana Downs).''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens in the future, Elliott Walden's name
can now be found on the national map.

<P>
   The vote for the Hall of Fame was announced April 27, and Lukas
was joined by jockey Russell Baze in Monday's ceremonies at
Saratoga. Lukas, 63, has won 3,794 races, and his stable is the
first to earn more than $200 million. He has trained 19 Eclipse
Award winners, won 13 Breeders' Cup events, and taken 12 Triple
Crown races. Baze, 41, has 6,666 victories, and his mounts have
earned $94.5 million. He is the only jockey to have ridden 400 or
more winners for seven consecutive years. The horses inducted were
Exceller, who beat Triple Crown winners Seattle Slew and Affirmed
in the 1978 Jockey Club Gold Cup, and Miesque, the turf filly who
was never out of the money (16-12-3-1), and became the first to win
two Breeders' Cup races (1987 and '88 Mile). Gun Bow, who staged
some legendary battles with Kelso in 1964 and '65, was inducted as
Horse of Yesteryear . . . The next assignment for Victory Gallop
will be the $1 million Pacific Classic at Del Mar Aug. 29, in which
he will meet Real Quiet for the first time since last year's
Belmont. Victory Gallop was going to fly to California last Friday,
but will now go out Tuesday. ``He coughed a couple of times Friday
morning,'' said Walden. ``I decided I didn't want to take a chance
on shipping him. When you're dealing with the best horse in the
country, you don't want to take any unnecessary chances.''

</P>
<P>
   Chilukki, the 2-year-old filly trained by Baffert, ran another
hole in the wind while winning the Sorrento Stakes at Del Mar
Saturday, scoring by 6 lengths. The daughter of Cherokee Run, out
of a Damascus mare, is 4 for 4, and she's been alone at the wire
every time, winning her races, including one against males, by a
combined 25 1/4 lengths. ``When you have a brilliant one like her,
you just have to manage them correctly,'' said Baffert. ``She went
:21 4/5 for the opening quarter, and she was just galloping down
the backside. She's the kind of filly that's so good that if
anybody tries to go with her, she just puts them away.'' Chilukki's
sire was a miler, at best, and the question she must eventually
answer is one of distance. Next on the agenda for Chilukki is the
Del Mar Debutante, on the Pacific Classic undercard . . . Stephen
Got Even, considered a key contender during the Triple Crown
season, was only 5-1 in the Derby before finishing 14th. He then
ran a decent fourth in the Preakness, and fifth in the Belmont. But
the son of A.P. Indy has gone so sour that trainer Nick Zito
wouldn't even enter him in the Jim Dandy, as originally planned.
``He's still feeling the effects of the Triple Crown,'' said Zito.
``We'll train him every day until he gets a speeding ticket.''

LONG ISLAND: FULL OF SURPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD KINDLEBERGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENPORT, N.Y. _ At Orient State Park, on the northeastern tip
of Long Island, an evening breeze blew in from the Atlantic, an
osprey rested atop a tall nest in the marsh, and a turtle paused,
with legs and head retracted, in its labored journey across the
road.
</P>
<P>
   The deer and red-tailed fox that also inhabit the park were not
in view during my brief stop. But in the next two days I saw both
species at other locations on a Long Island I found surprisingly
rural and beautiful _ and a lot easier to get to than many New
Englanders might think.
</P>
<P>
   The eastern end of Long Island _ as opposed to the densely
populated section closer to New York City _ has sleepy villages,
roadside stands, lots of farmland, and enough vineyards to supply a
small European fiefdom. It also has considerable variety, with its
rural tranquillity offset by the Hamptons, the resorts favored by
New York's rich and famous. And it has the stark beauty of Montauk
Point and, to the west, Fire Island.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there is a snap. Two hours out of Boston I was buying a
$63 round-trip ticket at the ferry terminal in New London, Conn.
After a pleasant 90-minute ride across Long Island Sound, the ferry
nudged into the dock at Orient Point.
</P>
<P>
   There was room to spare for cars on that weekday afternoon
crossing in late June. That would be almost unheard of on a ferry
to Martha's Vineyard or Nantucket at that time of year. High season
for tourists is expanding on Long Island's North Fork, but in this
old whaling port, 8 miles west of the ferry landing, some cafes
still don't open until July.
</P>
<P>
   The proprietor of a small bed-and-breakfast whose ad I came
across on the ferry seemed nonplused when I approached him for a
room. None of his rooms was made up and available for my unexpected
midweek business, he said.
</P>
<P>
   I ended up at the Townsend Manor Inn, paying a few dollars extra
for a view of the marina and pool. The $95 room had its limitations
_ a burnt-out bulb over the bed, a barely functional air
conditioner, and a clogged drain in the sink.
</P>
<P>
   At least the woman behind the desk gave me a little flavor of
life in Greenport. Asked to name the favored local pastimes, she
listed two: fishing and drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner at Claudio's Restaurant on the waterfront offered up the
first of several Long Island superlatives I happened on. Founded in
1870 by an immigrant Portuguese whaling hand who grew tired of the
sea, Claudio's claims to be the oldest same-family-owned restaurant
in the United States. (Later I added the nation's oldest cattle
ranch, in Montauk, which I visited, and the world's largest outlet
mall, in Riverhead, which I did not.)
</P>
<P>
   The quiet, leafy enclave of Greenport has an air of still
waiting to be discovered by the tourism boom. The village is in
sharp contrast with the upscale Hamptons that I would pass through
the next day. But if many of Greenport's past economic engines have
dried up, tourism is coming on strong, boosted by the area's
expanding vineyards and wineries.
</P>
<P>
   At one time Greenport was the port of embarcation for Long
Island Railroad passengers traveling to New England. The extension
of the railroad to Greenport in 1844 made it the fastest route
between New York and Boston, I learned at the local library. That
distinction was short-lived. Only a few years later new bridges
over rivers along the Connecticut coast opened up a faster rail
route between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
   The area got another economic boost in the 1920s when
Prohibition made eastern Long Island a favorite dropoff point for
rum runners. Its many bays and inlets made it particularly
advantageous to the smugglers. Business thrived at the local
shipyards, where repair work on speedboats fast enough to outrun
the Coast Guard was happily paid for in advance, according to a
Greenport history compiled by the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, maybe it was understandable that not
everyone thought rum running was such a bad thing. Local lore has
it that the municipal power supply in those times would
occasionally suffer an unexplained hourlong blackout, enough time
to move a new shipment of contraband liquor through town in the
dark of night.
</P>
<P>
   Claudio's cheerfully confesses on the back of its menu that its
upstairs ``became a lively place for imbibing the illegal spirits''
that passed through the waterfront during Prohibition. The
restaurant, then on stilts, arranged for shipments bound for New
York to be offloaded through a trapdoor under the building.
</P>
<P>
   Driving west the next day took me as far as Sayville, self-
described as America's friendliest city. Maybe that explained the
pet parade it was planning for early July and was advertising
downtown. Sayville, on South Bay across from Fire Island, was the
closest I would get to New York City, but still miles from the
Nassau County boundary.
</P>
<P>
   Easternmost Suffolk County is three times bigger than Nassau in
area but registered a population of roughly the same size, 1.3
million, in the last census. (Strictly speaking, Long Island
includes Brooklyn and Queens, although as boroughs of New York City
they are usually thought of separately.)
</P>
<P>
   The New York end of Long Island was settled by the Dutch in the
early 17th century. A little later, New Englanders crossed Long
Island Sound to put down roots on the eastern end.
</P>
<P>
   The island was heavily wooded until cleared for agriculture.
Farming has prospered to the point that Suffolk is reported to be
the most productive county in New York on the basis of wholesale
farm revenues. The region's increasingly respected wines have
proved such a success that grapes may one day rival potatoes and
cauliflower as Long Island's biggest crop.
</P>
<P>
   A hazy, overcast day almost persuaded me to give up on my visit
to Fire Island. But after I decided to chance it, a stiff breeze,
which almost took my hat with it on the 20-minute passenger ferry
ride from Sayville, soon brought out the sun.
</P>
<P>
   My destination was the Sunken Forest, a thicket of 250-year-old
holly trees managed by the National Park Service. It contains an
elevated wood walkway that steers visitors through thick woods with
charming twists and turns. Screened from the ocean by a barrier of
sand dunes, the woods are not so isolated as to blot out the roar
of the surf, the twittering of birds, and the sigh of wind blowing
through the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the Sunken Forest, I had a quick ocean swim. Walking
east, I soon came to the hamlet of Cherry Grove. Cars are banned on
most of Fire Island, a 30-mile barrier beach. So places like Cherry
Grove, which like some other Fire Island vacation spots has been a
longtime gay destination, are served by crisscrossing boardwalks
instead of streets. I ordered the Tuesday pasta special at
Michael's, on the wharf on the bay side, before catching the ferry
back to Sayville.
</P>
<P>
   The high life in the Hamptons occurs in East Hampton and
Southampton (not Bridgehampton or Hampton Bays). Sag Harbor, a few
miles to the north, is another enclave prized by rich New Yorkers.
A tourism official gave me a sense of their contrasting images:
East Hampton is known for movie people, Southampton for ``old
blood,'' and Sag Harbor for writers.
</P>
<P>
   East Hampton and Southampton are loaded with expensive
boutiques. Both have their multimillion-dollar houses with sweeping
manicured lawns and ocean views. Driving through, I found East
Hampton, with its towering old trees forming a canopy over the main
street, the more striking of the two.
</P>
<P>
   If being ready for polite society means knowing which fork to
use, South Fork is definitely the proper choice. A remark I
overheard, actually on Fire Island, could sum up the attitude of
people found summering well in the glitzier corners of Long Island,
if not across the nation: ``I just don't know how anyone survives
on less than a six-figure income.''
</P>
<P>
   One answer might be to skip the Hamptons and spend the night on
Montauk, at the easternmost tip of the island. Montauk has its
historic lighthouse, cattle ranch, and great views and beaches. Its
60 motels and other accommodations make their pitch more to
families and budget-minded singles.
</P>
<P>
   This was a different world from the private club with 30 grass
tennis courts that I heard about in the Hamptons. The office door
of one Montauk motel I stopped at directed prospective guests to
the bartender next door. (At another motel a similar sign said,
``Ask at the mini golf.'') I instead chose the Sands, where I had
to pay in advance and was told I would need to put down a $20
deposit to make calls from my room.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving South Fork the next day, I passed a gift shop shaped
like a 20-foot duck. A Long Island landmark listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, it is a leading example of a style of
roadside architecture. It was built as a tribute to the dozens of
duck farms Long Island once boasted.
</P>
<P>
   The duck might seem hard to miss, but the previous day I had
gone by it before realizing my mistake and turning back. After all
the hype I had read, it was smaller than I expected. And to me, its
narrow yellow bill made it look more like a gull.
</P>
<P>
   After three days on eastern Long Island, you could call me a
convert. A return visit looks like a must. After all, I've only
been to one of two dozen vineyards for the free tour and tasting. I
have yet to visit the Riverhead water park, even if it isn't the
world's biggest. And at Deep Hollow Ranch in Montauk, Buffalo Bill
and his Wild West Show await me still.

<P>
   SOFT-SHELL-CRABS (Urbanna, Va.) _ The sun was a blood-orange
disk pinned to the horizon as Thomas Lee Walton eased his 24-foot
Carolina skiff and headed toward the Rappahannock River. It was
6:05 A.M. We were going crabbing. Our quarry was the Atlantic blue
crab _ callinectes sapidus to marine biologists, which means
``savory beautiful swimmer'' in Latin. But not the run-of-the-mill
fellows. Walton fishes for ``busters'' or ``peelers,'' which are
crabs that have already begun to shed their shells, or are about
to, prior to growing new ones. If you catch them at the right
moment, and pull them from the water, the process of growth stops
and you have a soft-shell crab, one of summer's most prized treats
not only here on the rim of the Chesapeake Bay but also,
increasingly, in other cities across the United States. By R.W.

A MILLENNIUM FOR STAY-AT HOMES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will traveling for the millennium celebration be a bust?
</P>
<P>
   According to a Travel Weekly survey, 80 percent of consumers
will not travel this New Year's. The survey, however, found 8
percent have firm plans to travel and another 9 percent are
exploring holiday travel plans. Only 9 percent of those surveyed
said they were concerned about the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   Travel Weekly, a trade publication for the industry, noted the
reasons for not traveling: 63 percent said they plan to stay home;
50 percent found plenty to do where they live; 43 percent said the
millennium means nothing; 42 percent do not like traveling over the
holidays, and 23 percent felt millennium products were too
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Staying close to home does appear to be popular. At the Brown
Palace Hotel in Denver, most guests booked for their New Year's Eve
package ($1,799 to $1,999; call 800-321-2599) are from the Colorado
area. That night the Brown Palace will unveil a new clock sculpted
by Boston artist Robert Shure. Couples attending will receive a
limited-edition replica of the clock, which will chime for the
first time at midnight. The souvenir clock will be a millennium
collectors' item.
</P>
<P>
   If the thought of traveling over New Year's bothers you,
consider the Basin Harbor Club in Vergennes, Vt., where they're
planning a Millennium Beach Ball on Oct. 17. This seasonal family
resort will be closed in December. For details, call 802-475-2311.

   The Massachusetts Bay Railroad Enthusiasts will be running the
Berkshires Foliage Flyer Oct. 2. The train leaves South Station at
7:45 a.m. with stops along the way to Springfield, then on to
Albany where passengers can choose from optional activities such as
a Hudson River cruise, lunch, a tour of the USS Slater, or Albany
sightseeing. Tickets are $75 for adults and $40 for children 12 and
under. For information, call 617-489-5277. For those wishing to
travel first class, the private observation car Caritas will be
available. Tickets on the Caritas are $295 a person and include
meals.
</P>
<P>
   A luxurious way to catch the foliage is aboard one of the Great
Train Escapes' eight-day New England Foliage Express tours. Tickets
are $1,999 a person and space is available on the Sept. 18, 25, and
Oct. 16 departures. Travel is aboard the North American Explorer
with eight luxuriously restored vintage cars; where train service
is not available, passengers travel by motorcoach. The rail portion
is from Portland, Maine, into New Hampshire, Stowe, Vt., to Mystic,
Conn., and Cape Cod to Boston. The package includes many meals,
accommodations, transportation, and sightseeing. For information,

   Bermuda dreams &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever wanted to visit Bermuda? Better still, with your
company paying all the bills? That's what happened recently for the
people who work for Jordan's Furniture stores in the Boston area.
All 1,300 employees were flown to the island for a day of fun and
sun. It's a great idea, and now Steve Belkin, president of TNT
Vacations, which arranged the outing, is out to market it to other
companies in the New England area. Belkin, no surprise,thinks it's
a great idea. And to back this up, he's been closing up shop and
taking his employees to Bermuda every five years for the last 20.
In case your employer needs a reason to do a similar outing, Belkin
notes that a trip like this helps team building, is a morale
booster, reduces turnover, helps in hiring, and offers great
publicity. Add to this that it's a great value for companies.
Belkin notes it costs about 1 percent of the payroll, about $400 a
person for Bermuda. ``Do something good, and it comes back,'' said
Belkin. Employees like working for a company that does such things.
Bermuda likes the idea, too. Tourism people there feel if people
come for one day, they'll come back. Interestingly, TNT discovered
that 70 percent of Jordan's employees had never been out of the
country.

   The first exhibition to explore the transformative power of air
conditioning, ``Stay Cool! Air Conditioning in America,'' is on
view through Jan. 2 at the National Building Museum in Washington.
Through photos, artifacts, television commercials, and interactive
displays, the exhibit will explore the history of ``air
conditioning,'' beginning with pioneering experiments in the late
1800s. Manufacturers at the turn of the century were learning that
by filtering air and stabilizing temperature, mechanical systems
improved the environment for products . . . and people.

DISCOVERING THE REAL NOTTING HILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For weeks, ``Notting Hill'' has been giving moviegoers the warm
fuzzies. But it's also giving some of them the urge to see the real
Notting Hill in West London. Here, from George Murray, concierge
manager of London's luxurious Four Seasons Hotel, are some
suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   --Stop for coffee or tea at any number of coffee shops and
cafes. ``They're all lively and friendly,'' says Murray, but you
might head for those on Portobello Road, around which the movie was
filmed.
</P>
<P>
   --Visit antiquarian shops such as the Antique Clothing Shop at
282 Portobello Road, Antique Medical Instruments at 286 Westbourne
Grove, the Real Poster Galley at 72 Westbourne Grove, and Adrian
Harrington antiquarian bookseller at 64a Kensington Church St.
</P>
<P>
   --Take a lunch break. Pharmacy on Notting Hill Gate and
Kensington Place, around the corner from Notting Hill tube, are
modern and bustling. Choices for ethnic food include Khan's at
13-15 Westbourne Grove for Indian cuisine, Four Seasons (no
relation to the hotel) at 84 Queensway for Chinese, and Assaggi at
39 Cheapstow Place for Italian.
</P>
<P>
   --Go shopping. Christine Bec at 72 Westborne Park Road has hats
and designer clothes, Cath Kidston at 8 Clarendon Cross offers bed
linen and tableware, and Aime features French products ranging from
designer clothes to books to household accessories.
</P>
<P>
   --Heading away from Notting Hill, visit Kensington Church
Street, with its marvelous mix of pubs, cafes, restaurants, and
elegant antiques shops. You might try Clarke's at 124 Kensington
Church St. for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   --And don't forget Portobello Market every Saturday. It's the
world's largest antiques market. And it's something to see. &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of Notting Hill: We learn from another chief
concierge, Simon Thomas of the Royal Garden Hotel, that the
much-photographed blue door to Hugh Grant's flat in the movie is
actually the front door of a house owned by Richard Curtis, who
wrote the movie script. The house is for sale _ for about $2
million. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: Scotland Yard is in London. So why is it called
Scotland Yard? (Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: The new roller coaster at Six Flags Astroworld in
Houston is called the Serial Thriller. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``I've been to the bottom of the ocean, and I think
Hollywood is stranger.'' _ James Cameron, director of ``Titanic.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
It's contest time (for kiddies): In connection with its new family
travel section, MSN Expedia is sponsoring an ``Ultimate Family
Vacation'' contest. Youngsters 7-13 can submit brief essays on
their ultimate family travel idea to Expedia at
www.expedia.com/daily/family/. The first 500 entrants will receive
a Fuji disposable camera. Weekly winners will get a variety of
prizes, including Fuji digital cameras, and have their essay
published on the Web site. And they'll have a chance at the grand
prize, an adventure family vacation. The contest runs now through
Sept. 1; details and rules can be found at www.expedia.com/.
Expedia, incidentally, has added several new features and made its
site easier to navigate.

Today's fractured English lesson: A description seen on one
manufacturer's bras in Japan: ``These Underwears Fit Like a
Globe.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Oldies at sea: The years have gone by, but in his heart Harvey
Robbins is still a teenager in love with rock 'n' roll. For Harvey,
it's still a summer evening in the 1950s on Blue Hill Avenue in
Boston's Dorchester neighborhood, with the radio tuned to Symphony
Sid in his booth at the Hi-Hat, broadcasting the doo-wop sounds of
the Penguins and the Harptones and the Cleftones. And soon buddies
Gil, Bobby, and Ron will be by to join Harvey in some do-wopping of
their own, in a group called the Interludes. Those were the days,
my friend. Today Robbins is one of the fortunate few who has
transformed what he has always loved into a career _ he's a concert
producer who presents doo-wop shows on land and sea. From May
21-28, 2000, there will be good rockin' every night as Robbins
presents his Royalty of Rock 'n' Roll All-Stars in a multi-concert
Boston-to-Bermuda cruise on the Norwegian Majesty. The cruise will
be spiced with a variety of oldies shows on board and in St.
George's, Bermuda, where the ship will be docked for 3 1/2 days.
For more information or to make reservations, call Robbins at
978-256-6472. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? The London Metropolitan Police, which began in
1829, had its original headquarters at 4 Whitehall Place _ next
door to buildings that used to house kings and other important
visitors from Scotland. The surrounding area came to be known as
Scotland Yard and the name stuck to the police facility, even after
the police moved to new offices. Today, the facility is in the
Westminster section of London. (With thanks to the World Book
Encyclopedia and faithful contributor Mike Schuster of Foxborough,

GORE'S TWO STEPS FORWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- A very good buddy of Al Gore's observed the other
night that a good presidential candidate should never be shy about
poking a low-and-outside pitch the opposite way for a solid single.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting singles, he said, is rarely a thrill, but singles add up
in politics.
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, it's worth taking a peek at two clean hits the
vice president has made in the last 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The first was a speech at a community college in Minnesota,
during which Gore made a set of tax-reduction proposals that
focused on the middle-class and working poor, was out in front of
the Clinton administration, and required a ``he's on his own''
response from the less venturesome Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that a once-famous tax-reformer from the mid-'80s
named Bill Bradley has yet to opine on this topic.
</P>
<P>
   The second was an appearance on Capitol Hill here last week, in
which Gore cast his lot with the Senate Democrats trying for the
most ambitious of several possible ways of helping smaller farmers
cope with drought emergencies and hideously low prices.
</P>
<P>
   This act, too, put him in front of his administration and
outside its current policy arc. As the Senate worked its will, in
fact, the White House never did get around to taking a position,
but Gore's Iowa supporters were most anxious that this not deter
him for a minute.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that a self-proclaimed product of small-town
Missouri, just south of the Iowa border, named Bradley hasn't
weighed in on this one, either.
</P>
<P>
   Put the two together, and you have something a bit different
from the steady stream of recent policy positions from Gore that
appear to have taxed the dilligence of political reporters and gone
largely without mass media notice.
</P>
<P>
   As the vice president's top-heavy campaign slowly reorganizes,
its most important function _ supplying a message _ is closer to
achieving results. And the option reflected in Gore's last two
moves _ aiming at working families for whom government is not a
dirty word _ is the one holding the most promise.
</P>
<P>
   In tougher economic times, the ``forgotten middle class'' was a
Godsend for Governor Bill Clinton eight years ago. And for those
with longer memories, the message that Mike Dukakis belatedly and
with results turned to in the final days of '88 _ ``I'm on your
side, He's on their side'' _ is even more to the point. It's not
angry, but it is pointed, and while it fits Gore's record as well
as Clinton's, it's not confined by the latter.
</P>
<P>
   On taxes, for example, Gore regularly talks up administration
positions on everything from the R&AMP;D tax credit to incentives for
middle-class retirement accounts outside Social Security, and
stresses the greater importance of conserving most of any future
budget surpluses to help stretch the lives of the retirement trust
funds.
</P>
<P>
   But in Minnesota, he also stressed the portion of the so-called
marriage penalty that affects families of modest and low incomes.
</P>
<P>
   For the former, he would give joint filers the same standard
deduction as two individual filers; and for the working poor, he
would have additional provision for families benefiting from the
Earned Income Tax Credit.
</P>
<P>
   And he emphasized the value of an education proposal he made two
months ago _ providing a dollar in tax credit aid for every two
dollars workers and employers put in a new savings account for
college expenses.
</P>
<P>
   And what goes for ordinary taxpayers goes double for small
farmers. Gore was not merely supporting a higher aid figure in the
Senate's tussle over emergency legislation that for a change was
about a real emergency, he was supporting Democrats who not only
understand the havoc low prices have wreaked, but also understand
that the ``reform'' of 1996 that is designed to gradually wean all
farmers from government assistance is not working well.
</P>
<P>
   In supporting the most hard-pressed small farmers, Gore is
recognizing that what is at issue is not agriculture policy per se,
but rather the future of rural America _ a way of life that
encompasses small businesses, schools, and health clinics as well
as farms where the owning family does the bulk of the work.
</P>
<P>
   It's good people policy as well as good politics, and the more
of it Gore does, the better he'll do in the campaign.
</P>

EXCLUSIVE SPA EXPERIENCING GROWING PAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANTHONY FLINT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENOX, Mass. _ Settling into one of the salon's raised thrones,
clad in an impossibly soft terry cloth robe, Melissa Black had one
day left and 10 toenails to paint. Departure time from Canyon
Ranch, the luxurious spa nestled in the Berkshire hills, had come
too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But Black, originally from Needham and now living in Maryland,
had yet to use the $100 voucher that came with her package for the
spa's legendary ``health and healing'' services _ bio-magnetic
acupuncture, stress reduction counseling, or herbal medicine
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come for the workouts,'' said Black, undecided if she would
cash in the voucher or skip it. An Allure magazine is passed to her
for inspection. ``I've been to one other spa and my girlfriends
have been to a lot of other spas, and everyone says this place is
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Canyon Ranch, which opened 10 years ago as a high-end, New Age
spa, is one of the hottest resorts in the nation. It is wildly
popular not just with the New York clientele it first cultivated
but with a growing cadre of Bostonians. It is booked solid for the
rest of the year; there's no advertising budget to speak of and no
particular need for one.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as beneficiaries of the booming economy flock to Lenox and
queue up to pay $600 a night, some believe the spa's roots as a
holistic healing center are in danger of being forgotten. Many
people now seem as drawn by the exclusivity and Lexus-dotted, regal
grounds _ and to be pampered, with a 3-to-1 staff-guest ratio _ as
by the lessons in lifestyle changes through diet and meditation _
the basic philosophy that spa founders Enid and Mel Zuckerman
espouse.
</P>
<P>
   Among the herbal treatment consultations and pre-breakfast Tai
Chi sessions, cultures can clash. Some guests are annoyed by the
no-alcohol rule, and must struggle to keep their cell phones shut
off. Some harried newcomers come expecting instant relaxation. They
don't want to hear about art therapy and biofeedback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't care less,'' was the response of one woman who
poured herself a generous cup of steaming black coffee after
stretch class, when asked if she should be drinking organic green
tea instead of ingesting straight caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   Vivien Li, executive director of the Boston Harbor Association
and one of many Boston professional women who make the two-hour
pilgrimage down the Massachusetts Turnpike to Canyon Ranch, said it
invariably takes one or two days to unwind and conform to the
rhythms of the place. Few people wear flashy jewelry or dress up
much, she said, recalling running into Mary Tyler Moore on the
walking trails on one visit, clad in a distinctly unglamorous
sweatsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Li also recalls a game of ``wallyball,' a kind of indoor
volleyball, that quickly became fiercely competitive. On another
visit, Bob Frazier, a partner at the law firm of Goodwin, Proctor &AMP;
Hoar in Boston, paraded around the grounds wearing a T-shirt that
read: ``Born to Lead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `No, Bob, that's not how it works here,' '' Li said.
</P>
<P>
   And as much as the spa emphasizes its low-key, introspective
philosophy, the common experience of going to Canyon Ranch has
become a lingua franca for powerful women in Boston's business,
political, and and academic circles.
</P>
<P>
   Those who consider Canyon Ranch a mecca include Jacqueline
O'Neill, vice president at Harvard; venture capitalists Martha
Crowninshield and Cheryl Marshall; Diane Capstaff, vice president
at John Hancock and head of the Massachusetts Women's Forum;
Margaret McKinnon, president of Lesley College; and Kitty Dukakis,
wife of the former Massachusetts governor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Li said, networking while on the grounds is frowned on.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to fly, but it's remote enough you leave your
business behind,'' said Jennifer Lau, chief executive of Lau
Technologies of Littleton, a high-tech defense contractor. Lau said
Canyon Ranch is a gem, relatively accessible for busy Massachusetts
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for others, the resort itself has become too much like work
_ part of the unwinnable competition to have the classiest
vacation. It can be a place to see and be seen, with sightings of
the rich and famous reported back to peers.
</P>
<P>
   All of that is a long drift from Canyon Ranch's original
health-and-healing moorings, said Elizabeth Cook, head of cultural
affairs under Mayor Kevin H. White and former president of the
Advertising Club of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, who attends macrobiotic summer camp and is training to be
an arts therapist, said lately she prefers going to Kripalu Center
for Yoga and Health in nearby Stockbridge. ``I don't have to think
about what I pack when I go there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That image isn't helped by the opening of a third Canyon Ranch
in Las Vegas this year. The 126-room ranch in Lenox, set on 120
acres including a renovated 1897 mansion known as Bellefontaine,
opened in 1989 and followed in the footsteps of the first resort,
in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Joanna E. Roche, communications director for Canyon Ranch and
president of the local chamber of commerce, said it's all a matter
of educating guests. Some come expecting only plush luxuries, she
said, but soon realize ``this is a learning institution, a place to
change your lifestyle. We get men who are turning 50 and are
freaking out, who drink and eat red meat and have high cholesterol.
We have people who have lost spouses, changed jobs, or who've gone
through a divorce. For them, and for baby boomers who want to live
longer and live better, this is a cocoon that's safe, private, and
nurturing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some want instant gratification _ they just say, give me some
techniques. And some do complain if it doesn't work,'' said Marcia
Bernstein, a transplanted New York social worker who holds
stress-reduction consultations _ fitness for the mind and spirit
after guests have toned their abs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all run around like the Energizer bunny. We don't nap. We
don't take Mediterranean three-hour lunches. We have to be
multi-tasking all the time,'' she said. Most guests are eager for
help in managing the stresses of living in 1999, and seek to be a
more confident, serene, ``whole'' person, Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   There are inherent tensions in running a spa that promotes
healthy living, of course. The stately grounds, the plush rooms,
and the attentive staff can promote a sense of indulgence; yet much
of what Canyon Ranch teaches is about discipline if not denial.
</P>
<P>
   Bryn Zeckhauser, 27, a student at Harvard Business School, said
the health and healing programs aren't for everyone. ``I took a
breathing-stress class once and I think I started
hyperventilating,'' she said. But her mother used the center after
a bout with illness and her 83-year-old grandmother takes classes
on osteoporosis. The trio have been coming for seven years
</P>
<P>
   The salon, the pool, and the lush setting may be the main
attractions for an increasing number of guests. Even men, who are
coming in modestly greater numbers, are signing up for such
services as pedicures (the better to patrol the lawn at Tanglewood
in open-toed sandals, so de rigeur this summer).
</P>
<P>
   But ``that's the great thing about it,'' said Zeckhauser. ``They
have the option. Everyone does whatever they want.''

WORKSHOP PREPARES PRINCIPALS FOR A NEW ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES BANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Jeffrey Howard is about to make a school
principal cry.
</P>
<P>
   It's only day three of the summer institute sponsored by the
Principal Center at the Harvard Graduate School in Education.
Already some of the principals in this crowded lecture hall are
showing signs of strain.
</P>
<P>
   They shift in their seats as Howard hammers at the dismal
academic track record of US public schools. They grit their teeth
as he rattles off a list of the ways schools destroy student
initiative. Too many educators, he says, have accepted the
destructive assumption that some students are meant to excel while
others have limited potential.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Cheryl Smith, a principal from Austin, Texas, reaches a
boiling point. Tears flowing, she complains that Howard appears to
be ``damning a lot of caring educational professionals who are
working their hearts out for their kids.'' But Harvard's Principal
Center isn't about to accept this soft approach. The center's
recent nine-day workshop on accountability is dedicated to
preparing principals for the hard new reality of American schools:
the days when empathy and hard work were enough are gone.
</P>
<P>
   The monopoly that public schools enjoyed and that insulated them
from serious reform is being broken by such recent innovations as
competition, as school choice, vouchers, and charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   Today, schools must demonstrate that their hard work is yielding
results in the form of improved test scores. And when those scores
don't improve, principals find themselves on the hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy time to be a principal ,'' said Betty
McNally, assistant director of the Harvard Principal's Center.
``Public reporting on test scores is feeding public scrutiny, and
states are demanding more for their education dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   States and cities are rushing to implement testing programs that
reward or sanction administrators if test scores exceed or fall
below the state's expectations. In Newark, half of the city's 82
principals were replaced during the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the job of principal is becoming so difficult
that people are opting out. Urban school districts across the state
estimate that they will see vacancies reach 30 to 35 percent for
school administrators in the next seven years as retirements hit an
all-time high and replacements become hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1993 education reform law, principals are not only
responsible for running the building and dealing with parents, they
also must hire and fire staff and redesign curriculums. And as the
state begins to grade schools based on specialized general
knowledge tests, called MCAS, principals are beginning to be held
accountable for their students' scores. Principals, unlike
teachers, do not have strong unions, so they can be hired and fired
more easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't met an individual who isn't concerned about the
accountability topic,'' said Jane O'Connor, the principal of
Cunniff Elementary school in Watertown, who is one of the about 70
principals and administrators who attended last week's institute.
``It's shaken people up on every level, creating a rich discussion
about what should be happening in schools.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first year that the Harvard Principal's Center has
offered a summer institute on accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Dead-wooders, maintenance-mavens, and central-office-wannabes
need not apply to the summer institute, which is geared toward
experienced ``instructional leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   The faculty is also high-powered. Courses are taught by such
educational leaders as Rudy Crew, New York City Board of Education
chancellor, and Hartford School Superintendent Anthony Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Amato, who in his last job as Community School District 6
superintendent in New York City, was credited with helping to
significantly raise reading scores, says principals can view the
accountability movement as a monster or a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either you're going to control it or it's going to control
you,'' Amato says.
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief obstacles to school reform has traditionally
been bureaucratic inertia. ``You can change schools the same way
you change the direction of an ocean liner,'' says Howard, who
heads the nonprofit Efficacy Institute: ``Slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   New reforms are intended to speed the process, and one of the
latest trends is an attempt to hold individual teachers as well as
principals accountable for student performance. Several states are
starting to hold teachers' feet to the fire. Amato's new home
state, Connecticut, for example, now evaluates new teachers with
videotapes and peer reviews for their first three years in the
classroom. In Florida, starting this year, scores will play a part
in teacher raises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come for principals to say, ``I'm not going to be
the only one held accountable in schools,'' Amato says. ``The
principal must shift accountability to everyone.''

AIM OF NEW BROOKS ALBUM NOT `SOUL,' BUT `SELL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seen the new Garth Brooks video yet?
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you've watched the clip for ``Lost in You'' without
realizing it was Brooks, the country music megastar. That's because
he's traded his cowboy hat for a shaggy black wig and inky soul
patch, and shed his twangy high lonesome for a falsetto pop-soul
croon. Suddenly, the man credited with mainstreaming country music
has morphed into a Backstreet Boy.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. This wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that those
very same Backstreet Boys' sophomore CD ``Millennium'' recently
shattered the single-week sales record Brooks set with ``Double
Live'' last year, now would it?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, The Artist Formerly Known as Garth Brooks
is now calling himself Chris Gaines, at least for his upcoming
album. Stripped of his Wranglers and guitar, he's pushing
milquetoast pseudo-soul in the warbly vein of all those
cookie-cutter boy groups breeding like rabbits these days. He's all
moony eyes, droopy bangs, and melismatic curlicues, a tender
loverboy who wants all the ladies out there to know that he, too,
wants it that way.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not enough for Brooks simply to sound and look like the
Backstreet Boys _ OK, so he looks more like their older cousin with
a lapsed gym membership. He's created an entire persona for this
Gaines character, complete with father-son angst, an album that
spent 18 weeks at No. 1, and a disfiguring car crash that made ol'
Chris something of a recluse, until he decided to release his
greatest-hits CD. (Brooks will play Gaines in next year's film
``The Lamb.'') Leave it to Brooks to create a character who already
has several hit records.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Master P transforming into a patchouli-loving
Lilith Fair performer, or Andrea Bocelli switching it up to go
ghetto fabulous?
</P>
<P>
   Don't think for a moment that Brooks is abandoning all those
CD-buying friends in low places who've made him an obscenely rich
man. The album's title, after all, is ``Garth Brooks in . . . the
Life of Chris Gaines.'' This is about duping unsuspecting new
listeners _ especially those snapping up all those copies of
``Millennium,'' who would rather eat raw eggs than buy anything by
Brooks. And ``Lost in You'' is as hopelessly sappy as anything
Kevin, Brian, A.J., Nick, and Howie could make.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, if you can't beat them, become them.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is scheduled to explain all of this Tuesday night during
a VH1 Web chat, but save your time. If you know anything about
Brooks, you already know what ol' Garth is up to.
</P>
<P>
   A decent singer and performer, Brooks has always been as much
about world domination as music. He wants to be the biggest
recording artist ever, and it if takes hokum and gimmicks, well,
that's all right with him. Remember the publicity-grabbing
``sabbatical'' from music, so that he could try out with the San
Diego Padres? Then there was last year's ``Double Live'' album,
which was nothing more than a shameless, calculated ploy to sell a
million CDs in one week, and inflate his overall sales totals. In
the weird math of the music world, a double CD counts as two albums
even though they are sold as a single unit. As Entertainment
Weekly's music critic David Browne said when the CD was released,
``It's Brooks' bid to fulfill his obsessively demented goal of
selling more records than the Beatles.'' As of last year, Brooks,
already the best-selling solo artist in history, was in second
place with 67 million, to the Fab Four's 105 million.
</P>
<P>
   It's also common knowledge that behind his good ol' boy, ``aw
shucks'' persona, Brooks is ruthlessly single-minded about his
career, and woe to anyone who gets in his way. It's industry legend
that Scott Hendricks was booted out as president of Capitol
Records-Nashville, Brooks's label, in 1997 after the singer
complained that his CD ``Fresh Horses'' undersold because of
Hendricks's mismanagement. Even though the album sold 4 million
copies, Hendricks was shown the door _ especially when Brooks
refused to turn in his next album, ``Sevens,'' unless changes were
made, including the implementation of his marketing plan, which
increased the budget more than threefold. (Brooks was an
advertising major at Oklahoma State University. How convenient.)
</P>
<P>
   So now a label that has bent and nearly broken with the whims of
the man called ``Garth Vader'' and ``Garthzilla'' behind his back
has to figure out how to market Garth Brooks as Chris Gaines.
Still, it's similar to all-purpose discount store Target trying to
remake itself as hip and trendy. Can a leopard change its spots?
Sure. But even when a snake sheds its skin, it's still a snake.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. _ Kim Cooper adored her 7-year-old son, Scott.
But she had a love that was even more powerful, one that ruled her
daily life.
</P>
<P>
   When her son went outside to play, she would make crack cocaine
on the kitchen stove in her Billerica home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all I cared about,'' she said. ``I thought when I
couldn't get it I would die.''
</P>
<P>
   One spring day in 1996, Scott went to a friend's birthday party
and returned to find his mother handcuffed on the floor. A state
trooper, working undercover, had gone to the house and bought
cocaine from an acquaintance of his mother's.
</P>
<P>
   Before mandatory sentencing for drug offenders, a judge would
have had the option of allowing Cooper to remain free on probation
while she cared for Scott. But today, Cooper is inmate F36663,
sentenced to MCI-Framingham for five years for drug trafficking.
She is part of one of the fastest-growing segments of the nation's
prison population: women. And with that segment grows another:
children of female inmates, who are taken away from their mothers _
punished, although they are not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   For Scott, membership in the group has meant a weight gain of 40
pounds, temper tantrums at school, and antidepressants. He even
tried to cut himself with a knife.
</P>
<P>
   The boom in female incarceration has reopened debate over
whether laws intended to capture violent drug kingpins, who are
overwhelmingly male, should be used to lock up women, break up
their families, and send children to overstressed child-welfare
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a classic situation where you treat people apparently
equally who are unequal,'' said US District Court Judge Nancy
Gertner. ``The results are unfair. It is not the case that family
obligations fall equally on men and women, so not to take them into
account is unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Mothers behind bars face a unique set of struggles, and their
growing numbers pose new challenges to the penal system. Unlike
imprisoned men, whose children are often in the custody of their
wives, former wives, or girlfriends, female inmates are more likely
to lose their children to the state.
</P>
<P>
   The mothers are sometimes wracked by guilt, knowing their
criminal behavior caused their separation from their children. Many
dream of being together again with their children. But a new
federal law designed to speed adoption of children into safe homes
will make reuniting more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been such a rise in the female prison population, and
with that has got to come kids who are left in the wake,'' said
Lorraine Carli, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Social
Services. ``If there are no other alternatives, those kids are
going to end up in the foster care system.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean Fox, director of Aid to Incarcerated Mothers in Boston's
South End, organizes van rides to bring a dozen children to visit
their mothers at MCI-Framingham each week. When their mothers get
out of prison, Fox tries to help them with the transition. But it's
not easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a woman goes to prison, she loses her house, her
furniture, her kids, everything,'' Fox said. ``So when she comes
out of prison, she has to start all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's small nonprofit, and others like it, are struggling to
keep up as more women are imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   The female population in state and federal prison jumped
six-fold between 1977 and 1998, from 12,279 to 82,761, according to
the US Bureau of Justice Statistics. Two-thirds of the women behind
bars are mothers of minor children, according to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the number of women at MCI-Framingham rose
from about 450 to more than 600 between 1987 and 1997, the last
year for which Department of Correction statistics are available.
Drug offenses account for 25 percent of their convictions,
according to DOC records. More than a third of the women serving
drug sentences were jailed for possession, not trafficking,
according to DOC statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a new overall punitive philosophy that cuts
across criminal-justice and child-welfare systems, where you don't
give people a second chance and allow for the possibility that they
can change and rehabilitate themselves,'' said Philip Genty of
Columbia University Law School, a consultant for the Incarcerated
Mothers Law Project at the Women's Prison Association in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen percent of the female inmates' children in
Massachusetts are in custody of the Department of Social Services,
according to a Wellesley College study. Ten percent of the children
are in foster care and another 2 percent have been adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts worry that child-welfare systems, already
shouldering unwieldy caseloads, cannot handle the stress of more
children.
</P>
<P>
   But defenders of mandatory drug sentences say getting children
far away from their drug-addicted or drug-dealing mothers is more
critical than keeping together such families.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to ask ourselves is: Are the parents effective
role models and are the children better off by having other people
involved in their lives?'' said Plymouth County District Attorney
Michael Sullivan. ``Sad as it is, it's probably in the best
interest of the child to take the child from those environments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate, at least for some of these kids,'' said
state Representative Francis Marini of Hanson, the Republican
minority leader. ``You have to be responsible and it's the father
and mother of that child who are the cause of a child being in
foster care.''
</P>
<P>
   Some mothers inside prison acknowledge that they were not fit
parents when they were on drugs. Cooper said she has received
counseling in prison, and may be a better mother to Scott in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if she gets the chance.
</P>
<P>
   After going to prison, Cooper watched helplessly while her bond
to her only son frayed. First, Scott landed at his grandmother's
house in Maine, where he grew emotionally volatile and angry. He
was admitted to Jackson Brook Institute in Portland after he tried
to cut himself with a knife, which a doctor told his mother was a
suicide attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just full of all of these feelings and didn't know how
to get them out,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's parents couldn't handle Scott, and her former husband's
mother wanted no part of him, she said. Scott would have gone into
foster care, but his father took the boy and moved to Guam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's worse,'' she said, referring to the choice
between foster care and her former husband.
</P>
<P>
   Other mothers at MCI-Framingham describe feeling powerless as
their children on the outside tumble into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   From her cell at MCI-Framingham, where she is serving a
three-year mandatory sentence, Marcee Balfour tries to discipline
her three children and help them with homework. She is convinced
her 14-year-old daughter, Alisha, would not have gotten pregnant if
Balfour had been around to raise her.
</P>
<P>
   She's ready for her children's weekly visits each Sunday, with
detailed corrections on their homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be rough for her because I'm not there,'' she
said of Alisha. Balfour's release date is Jan. 14, 2001. ``The
hardest part about being in prison is the distance from my kids. I
have tremendous guilt over this.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after they leave prison bars behind, some women will face
new challenges in reuniting with their children because of a
recently enacted federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Signed by President Clinton in November of 1997, the Adoption
and Safe Families Act makes states terminate parental rights, with
few exceptions, if a child has been in foster care for 15 of the
previous 22 months. That means women sentenced to long prison terms
stand to lose their children.
</P>
<P>
   Compliance with the law is mandatory for states to receive
millions of dollars in federal aid. The Massachusetts Department of
Social Services is slated to receive $100 million in such aid.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, of Aid to Incarcerated Mothers, said attitudes against
women in prison are hardening, and her job of helping families
reunite will only get tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because a woman is in prison doesn't mean she's an unfit
mother,'' Fox said. ``For a lot of women, incarceration is not the
answer. Sometimes, drug treatment is the answer and incarceration
makes things worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Carli, the Department of Social Services spokeswoman, said
families plagued by drugs, poverty, and crime are often pulled
apart by two state agencies: the departments of Correction and
Social Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The profile of women going to prison is generally single head
of household, and that's about 50 percent of our caseload,'' Carli
said. ``On some level, the DSS and the prisons are drawing from the
same pool.''

CIVIL WAR TURNED JOURNALISM MORE TOWARD NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
BLUE &AMP; GRAY IN BLACK &AMP; WHITE 
Newspapers in the Civil War 
By Brayton Harris 
Batsford Brassey, 365 pp., illustrated, $25.95 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Union forces appeared to be on the way to a major victory
during the early hours of the first battle of Bull Run, and in
midafternoon, the New York Herald reporter telegraphed his editors
that he was heading back to the office ``with details of a great
battle. We have carried the day. The rebels . . . are totally
routed.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, extras were on the streets by 5:30 that afternoon
of July 21, 1861, hailing a great victory. But on the field at
Manassas _ as the South calls the battle _ the tide had turned and
the Union forces were routed by a fierce Confederate counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   It was evening before the extent of the Union defeat became
known in Washington, but when the New York Times reporter tried to
file a correction to his earlier ``victory'' dispatch, the censor
told him it was ``too late to countermand dispatches already sent''
and closed the office.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Philadelphia Inquirer published the first complete
_ and accurate _ report of the battle, angry, disbelieving crowds
gathered outside its offices.
</P>
<P>
   Such, reports Brayton Harris, were the professional perils of
covering the Civil War. ``It was not an easy job,'' he writes, for
these early war correspondents ``shared the weather and battlefield
and `amenities' with the common soldiers.'' And of the 500 known to
have covered combat in the war at one time or another (350 for
Northern papers, 150 for Southern), several were killed, about 50
had been held as prisoners of war, and ``most just wore out.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris is a retired US Navy captain. He served as a military
censor in Korea, and he lends perspective not only to the Bull Run
story, but also to the understanding of how large a factor
censorship was in the reporting of the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   In the North, such action was initially against
Southern-sympathizing newspapers. But, writes Harris, ``suppression
at times crossed over the line from controlling sedition to
punishing honest criticism.'' When the St. Louis Evening News
criticized General John Charles Fremont, the 1856 Republican
presidential candidate, for not having rescued the Union garrison
at Lexington, Mo., Fremont closed it down _ only to be relieved of
command after an investigation of his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, there were few Northern-sympathizing papers and
most of their publishers sold them shortly after the outbreak of
hostilities. As Union forces took over Southern cities, they often
took over the local papers as well. Among the illustrations is one
depicting Union soldiers who had been printers before the war,
putting out The Loyal Georgian, a ``new Union paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Fredericksburg, fought on Dec. 13, 1862, ``is perhaps the one
battle that had everything,'' writes Harris. ``It was covered
on-scene by specials from Northern, Southern, and international
newspapers'' and was reported ``with color, flair and style, the
copy written under the pressure of competition and fear, most of it
late at night by flickering candlelight.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Villard, covering for the New York Tribune, ``followed the
initial assault as far as the first ridge outside of town, then lay
on the ground to observe; by the middle of the afternoon he had
seen enough'' of what was to be a bloody Union defeat, Harris
writes. He was halted by Union troops on the road to Washington
but, ``spurred on by a desire to beat the competition,'' found a
pair of fishermen who rowed him out into the Potomac River, where
he hailed a passing steamer.
</P>
<P>
   After filing his story _ and sending it to New York by train to
avoid censorship _ he was summoned to the White House to give an
account of the battle to President Lincoln who, Villard wrote, was
``very much obliged,'' for he was ``very anxious and had heard very
little.''
</P>
<P>
   In marshalling this lively account of Civil War reporting,
Harris has wisely resisted the temptation to write about the
battles themselves, giving only the barest essentials of the action
while focusing on the way it was reported.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, best of all, Harris leaves the reporters to tell their
own story as much as possible. As a New York Herald reporter
challenged his readers: ``Those who suppose that the labor of a
news gatherer upon the battlefield is facile and rapid, should
stroll, as I have, over the ground where the dead yet lie unburied,
and the survivors expect momentarily to resume the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   The result of the war correspondents' labors, Harris suggests,
was the making of the modern American newspaper. A contemporary
observer, writing a year after the war ended, wrote that with the
war coverage, the newspapers' emphasis had shifted from editorials

   SOFT-SHELL-CRABS (Urbanna, Va.) _ The sun was a blood-orange
disk pinned to the horizon as Thomas Lee Walton eased his 24-foot
Carolina skiff and headed toward the Rappahannock River. It was
6:05 A.M. We were going crabbing. Our quarry was the Atlantic blue
crab _ callinectes sapidus to marine biologists, which means
``savory beautiful swimmer'' in Latin. But not the run-of-the-mill
fellows. Walton fishes for ``busters'' or ``peelers,'' which are
crabs that have already begun to shed their shells, or are about
to, prior to growing new ones. If you catch them at the right
moment, and pull them from the water, the process of growth stops
and you have a soft-shell crab, one of summer's most prized treats
not only here on the rim of the Chesapeake Bay but also,
increasingly, in other cities across the United States. By R.W.

Hampshire but came back strong in South Carolina, McCain is looking

most closely associated with campaign finance and tobacco, two

MERGER IS FLYING NICELY FOR WELLS FARGO CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Last year, under the leadership of Richard M.
Kovacevich, the Norwest Corp. bought San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo &AMP; Co. for $32 billion in one of the last great bank mergers
of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kovacevich has inherited a behemoth as the president and
chief executive of the heftier Wells Fargo. The new bank is the
nation's seventh largest with more than $200 billion in assets,
102,000 employees, 15 million customers, and 6,000 branches,
mortgage offices and other outlets in every state.
</P>
<P>
   While many mergers stumble, Kovacevich has done a good job of
fusing the San Francisco bank with Norwest Corp. of Minneapolis and
steering Wells Fargo into a new era, according to Wall Street
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   How? Kovacevich and his lieutenants have brought Norwest's
successful sales techniques to Wells Fargo, cross-selling many
products and services to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The old Norwest was a marketing wizard, selling customers an
average of four products each, from checking accounts to home loans
_ far more than other banking rivals. The old Norwest also was the
nation's leading mortgage lender, lending $60 billion last year to
homebuyers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Kovacevich is taking advantage of Wells
Fargo's sleek technology and business models, including supermarket
branches and on-line banking. Most analysts regard Wells Fargo as
the leading commercial bank on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management is genuinely committed to leveraging the strengths
of both companies,'' said Joseph Morford, a banking industry
analyst at Dain Rauscher Inc. in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the bank has dodged the problems that plagued Wells
Fargo's 1996 super-merger with First Interstate Bancorp. That
business marriage was troubled by computer and telephone foul-ups,
lost customers and a decline in loans and deposits.
</P>
<P>
   According to analysts, a patient Kovacevich plans to blend Wells
Fargo and Norwest at a steady pace over a period of two to three
years.
</P>
<P>
   To the relief of employees, Wells Fargo also has avoided the
mass layoffs that have haunted other mergers. A retraining program
and in-house networking also have helped out-of-work employees land
new jobs at Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   Executives had said in March they would cut about 5 percent of
the bank's 102,000-employee work force, or 4,000 to 5,000 people,
over the next two years. So far, 1,000 people have lost their old
jobs, but nearly all found new positions at the larger Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that Wells Fargo is on target to meet its
cost-cutting goals of $650 million within three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd give them a B-plus,'' said Tim Witt, a financial industry
analyst at Olde Discount Corp. in Detroit who gives Wells Fargo a
``buy'' rating. ``We applaud their successful merger. They've done
almost everything right when compared to other (failed) mergers.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would you assess the handling of the merger over
the past year, Kovacevich said in a telephone interview from
Minneapolis: ``The quick answer is it's gone very well, given what
a big change it is when you put together two companies of this
size.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask analysts who've had the opportunity to study other
deals, I think they would also conclude that our merger is going
far better than other ones.''

RETAILERS AGREE TO MONITOR CONDITIONS IN GARMENT FACTORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Four retailers have agreed to settle claims
contained in a class-action lawsuit accusing the companies of
allowing sweatshop conditions in garment factories in the U.S.
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement reached Monday, the retailers say future
contracts will require independent monitoring of their contracts in
the Western Pacific island commonwealth. The settlement also
prohibits recruitment fees, or fees charged to workers to go to the
commonwealth for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a watershed agreement,'' said San Francisco attorney
Michael Rubin, a partner in a law firm representing the workers and
human rights groups. ``We've established a model code of conduct
and monitoring program that will be used as a model in cases all
over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The workers are mainly young women from China, the Philippines,
Thailand and Bangladesh who speak little or no English.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement resolves a federal lawsuit filed in U.S. District
Court in Los Angeles and a state lawsuit filed in San Francisco
Superior Court, both on Jan. 13, concerning the four retailers:
Gymboree Corp., Nordstrom Inc., J. Crew Group Inc. and Cutter &AMP;
Buck Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The cases continue with 14 other retailers named, including Gap
Inc.; Wal-Mart Corp.; J.C. Penney Co.; Sears, Roebuck and Co.; the
Limited; and Dayton Hudson Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, four additional retailers _ Ralph Lauren, Phillips
Van Heusen, Donna Karan and Chadwick's of Boston _ filed a letter
of intent for a similar agreement. Those retailers were about to be
named in the original suits, said Al Meyerhoff, a lawyer for the
plantiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the garment factories in question are located on the
main island of Saipan, the capital of the Northern Marianas, which
became a U.S. commonwealth in 1976. The commonwealth is
self-governing with control over labor, immigration and customs.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement, the four retailers will set up a $1.25
million fund to pay for the independent monitoring program and to
cover partial damages to the workers. The lawsuit claimed the
workers, who were attracted to Saipan jobs for the opportunity of
working on U.S. soil, endured 12-hour days, beatings and deplorable
living conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the retailers named in the lawsuit had said they would
not have knowingly contracted with substandard factories on Saipan.
</P>
<P>
   ``A long, drawn-out battle didn't make good sense to us even
though we remain confident about our ability to successfully defend
ourselves in these lawsuits,'' Erik Nordstrom, the co-president of
Nordstrom's department store, said in a statement released Monday.
``We believe the settlement is a positive step toward our goal of
ensuring that the goods we contract to manufacture in Saipan are
made in compliance with law.''
</P>
<P>
   Gymboree, in a statement from its chief executive, denied having
liability under the lawsuits but said the agreement increased
protection for its workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now pleased to take another step to ensure we do an
even better job protecting the people who work for us so hard,''
said Gary White, Gymboree's chief executive. ``We believe the new
arrangement will take the protection right to the factory floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for Veriti, an Amherst, Mass.-based
nonprofit organization, to handle the monitoring process through
unannounced visits and private interviews with workers in their
native languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been case before in which retailers have agreed
to a monitor they haven't picked themselves,'' said Media Benjamin,
co- founder of Global Exchange, a San Francisco human rights group
that was a plaintiff in the class-action lawsuit.

SALON.COM REPORTS CONTINUE LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Salon.com on-line publishing venture saw
revenue jump while the amount of red ink continued to grow, the
company reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Salon's latest earnings report, its first since its
June 22 stock market debut, the edgy cultural Web site reported 1.3
million visitors to its various on-line departments in the second
quarter ended June 30. That compares to 567,000 visitors during the
same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But along with those new users came financial losses. The
company reported a net loss of $4.6 million ($10.10 per diluted
share) for the second quarter, compared with a loss of $1.4 million
($3.75 per diluted share) for the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue increased, however, from $408,000 during the second
quarter of 1998 to just over $1 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a land grab out there,'' said Michael O'Donnell, the
chief executive of the company, attributing the losses to staff
buildup and advertising. ``You have to spend to build a brand.''
</P>
<P>
   David Card, an analyst with New York-based Jupiter
Communications, an Internet market research firm, said Internet
users increasingly are turning to a ``handful of Web sites'' on a
regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's very much a land grab and very logical for Salon to be
spending big to grab those limited number of people,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   A: In ``Who Was Hulen?,'' a book about the naming of Fort
Worth-area streets, Werner Magnus writes that Rusk Street's name
was changed out of respect for its namesake, Thomas Jefferson Rusk.
</P>
<P>
   Rusk Street was located in Hell's Half Acre, a notorious
red-light district, and ``this seemed too undignified to the
citizenry,'' Magnus writes.
</P>
<P>
   In the book ``Hell's Half Acre,'' Richard Selcer writes that
merchants pressured the city to change the street name for years
because of its ``sordid connotations.'' The name became Commerce
Street in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   Rusk, who lived from 1803 to 1857, organized volunteers in
Nacogdoches to fight for Texas independence and became the
secretary of war, participating in the Battle of San Jacinto. He
was one of the state's first U.S. senators, along with Sam Houston.

SAMUEL BUTLER WAS AHEAD OF HIS TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Samuel Butler, a 20th-century man whose misfortune was to live
in the 19th century, is staging a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Butler was a renowned thinker who died when the 20th century was
still in diapers. His autobiographical ``The Way of All Flesh'' is
among the ``100 best novels of the century written in English'' as
selected by board members of the Modern Library. As with all other
cited titles, it is issued in a new Modern Library edition. It's
selling well, causing talk, and touching off a minibarrage of
essays _ some about the novel, more about its fascinating author.
</P>
<P>
   England's Samuel Butler (1835-1902) was a strange one. He was a
Homeric scholar who theorized that the ``Odyssey'' was composed by
a woman. Butler was a successful sheep farmer during a voluntary
exile in New Zealand, an early supporter of Charles Darwin and,
later, an articulate critic of the latter's ``On the Origin of
Species.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler was an all-around man of letters, an impassioned social
critic whose essays on matters philosophical, theological and
scientific still have freshness. He was best known during his
lifetime for ``Erewhon'' (an anagram of ``Nowhere''), the most
famous and arguably the best of all Utopian satires.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Way of All Flesh'' was no 20th-century novel after all.
True, it qualified for the Modern Library list by having been
published in 1903, but it was written between 1875 and 1888. Butler
specified that its appearance be deferred until after his death. He
had his reasons. In ``The Way of All Flesh,'' the somewhat
misanthropic Butler related the story of his own family. The novel
is a valid damning of Victorian society but is more powerfully an
indictment of parental cruelty and insensitivity. Ernest Pontifex,
the wayward hero, attributes all of his life's miseries to the
tyranny of Theobald, his father, and to the whining ineffectuality
of Cynthia, his mother.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that a fair number of the English literati read ``The
Way of All Flesh'' in manuscript and accepted all of it as truth.
Surely Butler exaggerated many of his book's particulars,
incorporated events that never occurred, and drew characters
without models from life. In semiautobiographical fiction, mystery
abides in the ``semi.''
</P>
<P>
   What was real and what was invented? ``The Way of All Flesh''
may be no more autobiographical than, say, Charles Dickens' ``David
Copperfield.'' It is surely less autobiographical than ``The Story
of a Bad Boy'' by Thomas Bailey Aldrich, an American and Butler's
exact contemporary. Aldrich's strong novel was intended for adult
readers but became, ironically, a semiclassic for young readers,
because its protagonist was an adolescent over much of the
distance.
</P>
<P>
   The premium American example of autobiographical fiction may
still be Thomas Wolfe's ``Look Homeward, Angel.'' ``The Way of All
Flesh'' has been more widely imitated by confessional authors, yet
it remains somehow singular.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas ``Copperfield'' begins with David's birth, Butler's work
considers three generations of the Pontifex family before Ernest
comes into their world. The distended text touches on every aspect
of Ernest's life, from infancy to the middle years; but in the way
that most autobiographical novels are meant to be instructive, the
teacher in this instance is not Ernest Pontifex. He is the
observed, not the observer. It's a first-person report, but Ernest
is conveyed in the third person by Edward Overton, the narrator,
who is Ernest's godfather.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest's misadventures never fail to interest, but the dominant
personage is Theobald, the monster of a father who also personifies
religious hypocrisy. Bullied by his father into the ministry,
Theobald in turn browbeats Ernest into theological pursuit. Like
Butler, Ernest attends Cambridge but does not take holy orders.
Before he makes a complete break from his parents, Ernest rides a
yo-yo of religious belief and disbelief. Samuel Butler was himself
the embodiment of struggle between faith and doubt that
characterized the late Victorian period.
</P>
<P>
   The novel is stylistically modern, closer to C.P. Snow than to
Dickens or Thackeray in both texture and spirit. No less a critic
than Bernard Shaw saluted ``The Way of All Flesh'' as the greatest
novel ever written.

BUSH W. BUSH: A SLICK WILLIE IN GOP CLOTHES? 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DARREN RICHARDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Judging from the early polls and his campaign's
fund-raising prowess, Texas Gov. George W. Bush has a very good
chance to become our next president.
</P>
<P>
   And, judging from his slippery responses to questions about past
cocaine use, Bush understands he can get a lot of mileage by
emulating the verbal evasiveness practiced so fluently by President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bush stands alone among 12 major-party candidates in refusing to
deny ever using cocaine, stating through spokeswoman Mindy Tucker,
``He's not going to get into the game of personal destruction.''
Election Day 2000 is still 15 months away. That's a long time to
dodge questions about drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is playing a game by saying he's not playing games; it's
sort of like Clinton's ``I didn't inhale'' marijuana qualifier,
just not as clever.
</P>
<P>
   His approach is to take the high ground, no pun intended.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with his strategy of hollow platitudes instead of
substantive policy proposals, Bush now says he ``elevates politics
to a new level'' by refusing to say whether or not he broke drug
laws in the not-so-distant past.
</P>
<P>
   If this is what Bush means by elevating politics, then he's
nothing more than a Republican version of Clinton Lite, pandering
to our cynicism with linguistic dances. Clinton got away with it
because he's Clinton, pure and simple, a freakish, once-in-an-era
manifestation of our worst assumptions about politicians embodied
in the person of a slick-talking Southerner with a heart of
papier-mache and the convictions of the latest tracking poll.
</P>
<P>
   Slick's act is tired now. And it was tired even before he
questioned, under oath, the relative meanings of the word ``is.''
The last thing the country wants or needs is another deceptive
pretty boy pretending not to understand what is expected of him as
leader of the free world.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush should know from his experience with alcohol, drug use
is no game. He has talked openly about how, at age 40, he realized
booze was taking a toll on his life and how he decided to stop
drinking for the good of himself and his family. Bush knows honesty
is crucial to any recovery; and where alcohol is concerned, he
seems to have put that knowledge into practice.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the good of the country he hopes to lead _ not to
mention a campaign that has been heretofore treated deferentially
by most of the news media _ Bush should be equally forthcoming
about what he did or didn't put up his nose during what he has
called his ``young and irresponsible'' years.
</P>
<P>
   If he has never used cocaine, he should say so. Case closed, end
of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   If he has used cocaine, he should deliver a major speech on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   He should also speak out if he may have used cocaine but cannot
remember because of an alcoholic blackout or some other reason. If
that's the case, responsible behavior demands that he tell America
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Voters should not dismiss Bush if he speaks frankly about his
past. He has made mistakes, like all humans, and he has displayed
impressive courage in turning his life around.
</P>
<P>
   What is not acceptable is silence about drug use, especially
when so many prison cells are filled with people who violated drug
laws, ridiculous and severe as some of these laws may be.
</P>
<P>
   To confront a potentially explosive issue directly would mark a
major departure from the head-in-the-sand, ``don't ask, don't
tell'' mentality that has eroded the credibility of the Clinton
administration. Such a speech would also offer hope to cocaine
users who continue to struggle with their own private demons.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, when he was running in 1988 for the Democratic
presidential nomination as a senator from Tennessee, admitted using
marijuana _ and inhaling _ in the wake of President Ronald Reagan's
ill-fated nomination of Douglas Ginsburg to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg, it seemed, had enjoyed a puff now and then while
teaching at Harvard University in the 1970s. When this became
public knowledge, Ginsburg, rather than hypocritically assert he
could impartially uphold the law after willfully breaking it many
times, simply withdrew his name from consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that using marijuana in the '60s and early '70s was
akin to drinking moonshine during Prohibition. He admitted getting
stoned as a student while in college, as a soldier in Vietnam and
as a reporter in Nashville. Gore met the potential crisis head on,
defused it, and it wasn't even an issue in 1992 when Clinton tabbed
him as the vice presidential pick.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is taking his cue from the wrong half of the Clinton-Gore
team. And perhaps, if Bush can raise $37 million in campaign cash
before a single primary vote has been cast, a brave speech about
cocaine might persuade Americans to donate to drug rehabilitation
centers, or at the very least acknowledge that cocaine abuse is a
serious problem that crosses all socioeconomic and ethnic lines.
</P>
<P>
   The president that Bush hopes to succeed, sadly, hasn't been
able or willing to speak frankly about so many things, personal as
well as political. To distinguish himself from that pathetic
legacy, all George W. Bush has to do is tell the truth about
cocaine _ or tell us it's none of our business. Just spare us a GOP
version of Dances with Words.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not he's capable of coming clean will tell voters all
we need to know about the ``character issue'' in regard to this
particular candidate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Darren Richardson, a copy editor for the San Francisco
Examiner, says he used cocaine once, in 1987, and liked it so much
he realized the responsible course of action was never using it
again.)

GORE'S TWO STEPS FORWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- A very good buddy of Al Gore's observed the other
night that a good presidential candidate should never be shy about
poking a low-and-outside pitch the opposite way for a solid single.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting singles, he said, is rarely a thrill, but singles add up
in politics.
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, it's worth taking a peek at two clean hits the
vice president has made in the last 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The first was a speech at a community college in Minnesota,
during which Gore made a set of tax-reduction proposals that
focused on the middle-class and working poor, was out in front of
the Clinton administration, and required a ``he's on his own''
response from the less venturesome Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that a once-famous tax-reformer from the mid-'80s
named Bill Bradley has yet to opine on this topic.
</P>
<P>
   The second was an appearance on Capitol Hill here last week, in
which Gore cast his lot with the Senate Democrats trying for the
most ambitious of several possible ways of helping smaller farmers
cope with drought emergencies and hideously low prices.
</P>
<P>
   This act, too, put him in front of his administration and
outside its current policy arc. As the Senate worked its will, in
fact, the White House never did get around to taking a position,
but Gore's Iowa supporters were most anxious that this not deter
him for a minute.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that a self-proclaimed product of small-town
Missouri, just south of the Iowa border, named Bradley hasn't
weighed in on this one, either.
</P>
<P>
   Put the two together, and you have something a bit different
from the steady stream of recent policy positions from Gore that
appear to have taxed the dilligence of political reporters and gone
largely without mass media notice.
</P>
<P>
   As the vice president's top-heavy campaign slowly reorganizes,
its most important function _ supplying a message _ is closer to
achieving results. And the option reflected in Gore's last two
moves _ aiming at working families for whom government is not a
dirty word _ is the one holding the most promise.
</P>
<P>
   In tougher economic times, the ``forgotten middle class'' was a
Godsend for Governor Bill Clinton eight years ago. And for those
with longer memories, the message that Mike Dukakis belatedly and
with results turned to in the final days of '88 _ ``I'm on your
side, He's on their side'' _ is even more to the point. It's not
angry, but it is pointed, and while it fits Gore's record as well
as Clinton's, it's not confined by the latter.
</P>
<P>
   On taxes, for example, Gore regularly talks up administration
positions on everything from the R&AMP;D tax credit to incentives for
middle-class retirement accounts outside Social Security, and
stresses the greater importance of conserving most of any future
budget surpluses to help stretch the lives of the retirement trust
funds.
</P>
<P>
   But in Minnesota, he also stressed the portion of the so-called
marriage penalty that affects families of modest and low incomes.
</P>
<P>
   For the former, he would give joint filers the same standard
deduction as two individual filers; and for the working poor, he
would have additional provision for families benefiting from the
Earned Income Tax Credit.
</P>
<P>
   And he emphasized the value of an education proposal he made two
months ago _ providing a dollar in tax credit aid for every two
dollars workers and employers put in a new savings account for
college expenses.
</P>
<P>
   And what goes for ordinary taxpayers goes double for small
farmers. Gore was not merely supporting a higher aid figure in the
Senate's tussle over emergency legislation that for a change was
about a real emergency, he was supporting Democrats who not only
understand the havoc low prices have wreaked, but also understand
that the ``reform'' of 1996 that is designed to gradually wean all
farmers from government assistance is not working well.
</P>
<P>
   In supporting the most hard-pressed small farmers, Gore is
recognizing that what is at issue is not agriculture policy per se,
but rather the future of rural America _ a way of life that
encompasses small businesses, schools, and health clinics as well
as farms where the owning family does the bulk of the work.
</P>
<P>
   It's good people policy as well as good politics, and the more
of it Gore does, the better he'll do in the campaign.

XIT RANCH REUNION REQUIRES TEXAS-SIZE BARBECUE PIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas writer Jerry Flemmons once wrote: ``Of the world's four
great cuisines _ French, Italian, Chinese and Texan _ only the
latter has a recipe beginning, `First, dig a 3-foot-deep hole.
...'''
</P>
<P>
   Flemmons was speaking of a skimpy, Texas backyard barbecue, of
course, not a cookout like the one in Dalhart this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It is there, high in the Texas Panhandle, that the XIT Rodeo and
Reunion takes place each August. This was the 63rd reunion and, as
usual, more than 20,000 free barbecue meals were handed out.
</P>
<P>
   The XIT was once the largest ranch in Texas, somewhere around 3
million acres _ land exchanged for construction of the state
Capitol. The ranch was eventually parceled off and it no longer
exists. But an XIT organization sponsors the barbecue each year,
financed through ticket sales to a rodeo and dances.
</P>
<P>
   The first reunion was part of the 1936 Texas Centennial and was
celebrated in Fort Worth. The following year, it was moved to
Dalhart where it remains.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch was big, and so is the reunion barbecue. It calls for
two pits (one extra in case it rains) 4 feet deep, 4 feet wide, and
75 feet long. Volunteers work all winter collecting wood for the
fire. They prefer mesquite, but when you need that much wood, you
take what you can get. On Thursday, workers stacked the wood in the
pit until it was piled 5 feet above ground.
</P>
<P>
   It took about 25 truckloads.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was set ablaze before dawn Friday and allowed to burn
for about 12 hours. In the interim, the meat was prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say this is the procedure: Take about 11,000 pounds
of meat in the form of roasts (topside round) weighing about 15
pounds, cut each in half and roll it in special seasoning. Put the
roast in a special paper sack, and then in a burlap bag and tie it
with wire. Soak it in water and put it in a truck. Just before
placing the meat on the coals about 2 p.m. Friday, the Fire
Department soaks the bags of meat again.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the really special and unique touches.
</P>
<P>
   Grader blades (from a road grader) are laid across the pit on
top of the meat and covered with tin, and then with dirt. Then the
meat cooks for 24 hours. Afterward, scrape away the dirt, pull away
the tin, remove the grader blades, open the bags and eat.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever driven down a Texas back road and envied the
slow-paced, leisurely lifestyle of the grazing cattle?
</P>
<P>
   Have you wondered what it would be like to be a proud English
aristocrat like a Hereford, or a durable Scotsman like an Angus?
How about something exotic like an African Watusi or purely
American like a Santa Gertrudis? Anything from a milk cow to a
Texas longhorn?
</P>
<P>
   If you have entertained such thoughts, you should probably seek
professional help. But before you do, write to Howard Payne
University professor Frank Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp is working on a doctoral dissertation about cattle. He is
studying their history, but he also wants to know how you feel
about them _ which ones do you like the best? The least? What
images do the different breeds evoke? Essentially, he wants to know
what kind of cow or bull you would be if you could be one at all.
</P>
<P>
   Send your comments to Sharp at 20 Country Club Drive, Brownwood
76801. Or e-mail him at fsharp(at)hputx.edu.
</P>
<P>
   He'll get back to us with the results. He promises the
information will be published in a scholarly article and again in a
subsequent book.

 EDITORS NOTE: This story is made up of a main bar, short
pieces  about lawn care (and lawn mower racing!) and a resource
box.   Living by the Blades: Turf experts inch toward cutting-edge 
 lawns  
   
   
 By Holly Ocasio Rizzo 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; New lawns face a tough test: Ali Harivandi's test.
For 20 years, the environmental horticulturist has planted,
nurtured and coaxed grass seeds to sprout at trial plots in Santa
Clara. Then he has examined and cross-examined them to judge the
best grasses for Bay Area lawns.  &LR; The U.S. Department of
Agriculture compiles the results.
<P>
   &LR;  Turf experts such as Harivandi, who works for the University
of California Cooperative Extension Service in Hayward, are
responsible for an explosion of new varieties of grasses that can
withstand kids, dogs, heat and drought. And, as grass becomes
stronger, it is also acquiring a new aesthetic _ still the green
frame around a house, but also studded with low-growing wildflowers
and mowed in naturalistic patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``As new varieties come to market, we plant them and evaluate
them monthly for color, texture, weed activity _ all the factors
about a lawn that concern people,'' Harivandi says. ``At least once
a week we gat a call from somebody who has a new variety for us to
test.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; What's New
</P>
<P>
   The testers here and elsewhere look for an ideal lawn, one that
is dark green, soft, dense, disease resistant _ and doesn't require
much sprinkling or mowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're recommending tall fescues for the Bay Area,''
Harivandi says. A fescue lawn tolerates drought, requiring 20
percent less water than other lawns.
</P>
<P>
   But it can't be just any fescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``What works well in Nevada under irrigation is not what works
in San Francisco or Santa Clara or Lafayette,'' says Paul Albright,
owner of Albright Seed Co., a supplier based in Martinez and
Camarillo.
</P>
<P>
   How can you find out if the fescue you like will like you and
your microclimate? ``Local extension agents' recommendations are
reliable,'' Albright says.
</P>
<P>
   University extension staff also can tell you the pros and cons
of the other high performers for the Bay Area _ bluegrass,
perennial rye grass and hybrid Bermuda grass. They can tell you
about some of the hundreds of new varieties that withstand little
feet, paws and other family traffic.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In Bloom &LR;
</P>
<P>
   You can even go one better and include some color in your lawn.
Albright's company is one of several selling seed mixtures
containing wildflowers. One of Albright's, North Berkeley Low Fuel
Concoction, is a mix of fescue, poppy, lupine and clover intended
for quick coverage of slopes scorched by wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   The flower trend developed in Oregon, a state that calls itself
the grass seed capital of the world. At the University of Oregon, a
horticulturist sought a blend of grass and flowers that would look
pretty but require minimal water or mowing.
</P>
<P>
   The result, called Northern Ecology Lawn Mix, is created mixed
 &LR; and sold by Nichols Garden Nursery of Albany, Ore. ``It grows 8
inches high at most,'' says Betty Walker of Nichols. ``We mow ours
about every three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Park in Your Yard &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Even the plainest yards get dressed up nowadays with specialty
mowing. The new aesthetic is mowing higher under trees than in open
areas for a parklike appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Even ordinary lawns acquire sophistication when they're mowed in
patterns. And pattern mowing offers more than superficial benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like in the old days of cattle trains, if you mow the same way
all the time, you could wear paths in the grass,'' says Bill Lowe,
product manager for Snapper Power Equipment in McDonough, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``You especially have the potential of mowing ruts into your
yard when the ground is slightly damp. If you change directions,
the chance decreases.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross mowing _ creating a plaid effect _ helps lift grass
blades, ensuring a more even cut and chopping the clippings into
fine mulch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have a healthier, better-looking yard if you mow in
different directions,'' Lowe says.
</P>
<P>
   The next turf frontier: creating a no-mow grass. ``If someone
comes along and says, `Here's a lawn you only need to mow once
every two weeks,' but once a week isn't enough for the lawn I have
now, I'm going to buy it,'' Harivandi says.
</P>
<P>
   As long as you have to mow, here are some tips for choosing,
caring for and enjoying your lawn. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Meet Your Grass &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Grass comes in two varieties _ sod forming, which grows secondary
shoots along horizontal stems, and bunching, which expands from
clumps. Here are the most common grasses of both varieties for Bay
Area lawns:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KENTUCKY BLUEGRASS  &LR; (Poa pratensis)cq &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Relatives: &LR;  Sod-forming grass, more than 100 varieties.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Characteristics: &LR;  Fine texture; rich blue-green color; heat-,
wear- and drought-tolerant.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Likes: &LR;  Fertilizer; lots of water when weather is hot.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dislikes: &LR;  Shade or lots of moisture (some varieties); growing
from seed (some varieties).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TALL FESCUE &LR;  (Festuca elatior)cq &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Relatives: &LR;  Bunching-type grass; most widely grown lawn grass
in Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Characteristics: &LR;  Coarse texture; new varieties have fine
blades; deepest-rooted among cool-season grasses, so it tolerates
drought as well as heat, wear and shade.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Likes: &LR;  Less water than other varieties; growing to 4 inches
between mowings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dislikes: &LR;  Extremely low temperature.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PERENNIAL RYEGRASS &LR;  (Lolium perenne)cq &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Relatives: &LR;  Bunching types; more than 180 varieties (compared
with seven in 1970).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Characteristics: &LR;  Germinates quickly; tolerates drought and
wear; may mow unevenly because of tendency to lie flat under mower.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Likes: &LR;  Growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dislikes: &LR;  Hot and cold extremes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HYBRID BERMUDA GRASS &LR;  (Cynodon dactylon)cq &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Relatives:  &LR; Sod-forming grasses.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Characteristics: &LR;  Fine texture; pest and disease resistant;
invasive root system leads to its reputation as a weed outside the
lawn.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Likes: &LR;  Inland heat, drought, poor soil, rapid growth requiring
frequent mowing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dislikes: &LR;  Shade, winter (some varieties turn brown in cool
weather). &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Rogues' Gallery &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lawns face many menaces. Here are some ways to discourage the
biggest and baddest.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Weeds: &LR;  Dandelions, crabgrass and their unsightly ilk that
crowd grass for nutrients and water; dig or pull out, including
roots, or apply a weed killer-fertilizer or pre-emergent control
product.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cutworms: &LR;  Moth caterpillars that chew off blades at ground
level under cover of night, causing holes and ragged appearance;
control with natural predators, such as beneficial soil nematodes,
or earthworms, or with insecticide containing diazinon or carbaryl
and labeled for lawn use.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sod webworms: &LR;  Moth caterpillars that build web-lined tunnels
underground and eat grass blades, causing turf to turn patchy
brown; control with beneficial soil nematodes, or earthworms, or
insecticides containing diazinon or chlorpyrifos labeled for lawn
use.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Brown patch: &LR;  Fungi-caused disease causing irregularly shaped
or circular brown areas in lawn; prevent by planting resistant
grass varieties, avoiding excess fertilizer, watering only in
morning, mowing higher in summer and raking up grass clippings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Red thread: &LR;  Fungus that skulks into lawns from late fall
through early spring, most often in coastal areas, its red
jellylike strands seeming to mat perennial ryegrass blades
together; prevent by planting resistant varieties, aerating lawn if
soil is compacted, fertilizing to build up lawn's resistance.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thatch: &LR;  Buildup of dead roots, stems and debris below grass
blades that stops air, fertilizer and water from reaching roots;
prevent by raking lawn regularly. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Gentlemen, Start Your Mowers &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
The stock models reach top speeds of 10 mph; modified drags, 70
mph. We're talking about power here. We're talking about racing
ride-on lawn mowers.
</P>
<P>
   You may see racers live and up close soon at the Cow Palace,
which has begun talks with the U.S. Lawn Mower Racing Association
about competing in San Francisco. ``This is a bigger sport that we
thought,'' says Bill Mendez, operations director at the Cow Palace.
</P>
<P>
   For a preview, watch racing in November on TNN. The cable
broadcaster plans Sunday evening broadcasts of six competitions in
the USLMRA-sanctioned Sta-Bil National Lawn Mower Racing Series.
</P>
<P>
   The circuit starts each April 1, stopping at festivals and
fairs, though it hasn't come to California in recent years. It
involves no purse money. Racers ages 16 to 82 compete for trophies,
bragging rights and fun, says Bruce Kaufman, USLMRA president.
</P>
<P>
   Most races are held on road-style tracks, preferably on grass.
Drag races are held on 150-foot strips. Racers with comparable
mowing equipment compete against each other. Some have pit crews
and sponsors. A few, like big-time wrestlers, have powerful names:
Blades of Thunder or the Iron Maiden. For safety, none of the
mowers has blades.
</P>
<P>
   Tap  &LR; www.letsmow.com  &LR; into your Web browser for information
about becoming a racer or spectator. ``Once you've seen a race,
you'll never look at the weekend chore of mowing quite the same way
again,'' Kaufman says. &QL;

Hot  Stuff, the San Francisco Chronicle's weekly roundup of great

 SAN FRANCISCO _ Distinctive Designs ' wiry, delicate-looking
objects may appear to be full of air, but they actually hold a wide
range of household items.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Veena Santhiogoset of San Francisco got the idea for her beaded
wire baskets during a wire-sculpting class. ``She picked it up in
one day,'' remembers her husband, Steven Reinhold. ``We brought
some of the items to a gift fair and the business went from nothing
into something overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The husband-and-wife team's repertoire now includes the pictured
champagne bucket ($57), with a plastic insert for holding ice, and
short and tall wine holders, in copper and black wire ($22 to $28).
</P>
<P>
   Other Distinctive Designs pieces include jewellike lanterns ($64
to $140), large covered breadbaskets ($75 to $108) and fanciful
night lights ($40 to $55).
</P>
<P>
   The unique spiral wire and beaded designs are also incorporated
in handmade wood furniture and accessories. The ``Millennium End
Tables'' ($325) feature inner halogen lights that shine through
large colored beads embedded in the wood.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The Distinctive Designs studio is open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. &LR; 
 &LR; Monday through Friday or by appointment. 3259 Mission St., &LR; 
 &LR; second floor, San Francisco, (415) 647-2131. You can also find &LR; 
 &LR; the products at Zia Houseworks, 1310 10th St., Berkeley, (510) &LR; 
 &LR; 528-2377; Spirals, 367 University Ave., Palo Alto, (650) &LR;

 Editors note: The San Francisco Chronicle rounds up the best
of  the unusual for home and garden in this regular feature, Off
the 
 Wall.   OFF THE WALL: Do-It-All Recliner Has You Sitting Down on the Job  
   
 By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
SAN FRANCISCO _ With their enveloping padding and almost horizontal
recliners, you may think that La-Z-Boys were already as
comfortable, not to mention impossible to get out of, as they could
be.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, you're wrong. The maker of this classic icon of American
comfort and domestic fashion is making sure that you will never
leave your chair _ ever _ again. The new Maxim La-Z-Boy offers all
the comfort of your favorite chair plus all the convenience of your
office.
</P>
<P>
   But let there be no confusion here. This chair isn't for working
from home, it's for enjoying the game in the best way possible.
Armchair-quarterback owners of the Maxim ($760) can screen phone
calls, order pizza on a speaker phone, get a soothing massage when
the opposing team wins and hook up to the Web to check scores on
other games. Of course, there are also compartments for a TV
directory book  &LR; and a favorite beverage.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out in stores next month, La-Z-Boy takes the inevitable
next step with Oasis ($899). This beauty has all the features of
the Maxim, but in lieu of a modem hookup there's a built-in cooler
that just happens to be big enough to hold a six-pack.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHERE TO FIND IT
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; La-Z-Boys are available at La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries,
Montgomery Ward and other furniture outlets. Call (800) 625-3246 or
visit  &LR; www.lazboy.com &LR;  to find the nearest location. &QL;

These are the stories The San Francisco Chronicle Home section
plans to move Tuesday, Aug. 10, on the New York Times News Service
wire. Questions? Please call Holly Ocasio Rizzo at 415-777-8811. &HT;      San Francisco _ LAWN _  New lawns face a tough test: Ali
Harivandi's test. For 20 years, the environmental horticulturist
has planted, nurtured and coaxed grass seeds to sprout at trial
plots in Santa Clara. Then he has examined and cross-examined them
to judge the best grasses for Bay Area lawns.
 &HT;    Turf experts such as Harivandi, who works for the University of
California Cooperative Extension Service in Hayward, are
responsible for an explosion of new varieties of grasses that can
withstand kids, dogs, heat and drought. And, as grass becomes
stronger, it is also acquiring a new aesthetic _ still the green
frame around a house, but also studded with low-growing wildflowers
and mowed in naturalistic patterns.
 &HT;    With optional sidebars: varieties to plant, Care and feeding,
pests and remedies, lawn-mower racing, where to learn more.

A MIRACLE FROM ASSISI 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If only by virtue of the fact that cinema bad
boy Mickey Rourke once played him in a movie, we can conclude that
St. Francis of Assisi appeals to a broader spectrum of folks than
your average saint.
</P>
<P>
   Even people who don't believe in God have been drawn over the
past 900 years to the nature-loving, peace-preaching Italian monk.
During that time the basilica that honors him in his home region
has been a magnet for pilgrims of all spiritual bent (and twist).
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for a series of killer earthquakes that began in
Assisi Sept. 26, 1997, St. Francis' basilica would currently be
doing business as usual _ which is to say booming. But the quakes
destroyed about 2,000 square feet of one of the 13th-century
structure's two churches. Part of the upper church's roof
collapsed, and priceless frescoes by such Italian masters, as
Giotto and Cimabue were reduced to fingernail-sized chips and
masonry dust.
</P>
<P>
   From that catastrophe, a wonderful opportunity has been given to
the citizens of and visitors to Milan, Paris, New York and San
Francisco. As part of a $60 million restoration project, scores of
surviving works of art and reliquaries from the basilica are out of
their damaged home and on tour.
</P>
<P>
   Through Nov. 14, they will rest here, in a city named after
Francesco di Assisi, in the Palace of the Legion of Honor in
Lincoln Park. A dollar from each admission ticket will go toward
the basilica's restoration.
</P>
<P>
   For at least a dozen reasons, I plan to visit _ to be near St.
Francis' ``things'' _ as often as I can manage. During a deeply
moving visit I made to Assisi in 1989, I realized the power of
proximity to all those beautiful devotional tributes to a man of
simple but perfect spiritual philosophy. It's as close as I can
ever come to feeling the saint's breath upon me.
</P>
<P>
   When I say ''things,'' I don't mean Francesco's hairbrush or
rough brown monk's robe or even his prayerbook. He was buried the
day after he died (in 1226) and _ thanks to a vow of poverty and
perpetual giving _ didn't exactly leave a warehouse of possessions
and memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   The basilica grew up over the centuries around his sacred bones.
All sorts of people who felt moved by and connected to St. Francis
_ from King Henry III of England to the now-nameless artists who
painted the monk's likeness on wood _ contributed to the devotional
decorating.
</P>
<P>
   The trappings of their reverence, honor, awe and love constitute
St. Francis' ``things.'' And you don't have to be Catholic to
imagine that those trappings exude what New Agers might call ``a
lot of great energy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the traveling exhibit, one of the most touching and
representative examples of what I mean is a late 15th century
triptych with a carved gilt frame that pictures the Virgin Mary
with baby Jesus and two angels as its centerpiece. Depicted on the
side panels are Christ tied to a column and John the Baptist on a
journey.
</P>
<P>
   Almost unheard of for that era, the artist actually signed the
piece, infusing it with an animate intimacy: ``Franciscus Gentilis
me pinxit'' _ ``Francisco of Gentile painted me.''
</P>
<P>
   A portrait of Christ, painted in the early 1460s and attributed
to Fra Angelico's star pupil, Benozzo Gozzoli, is heartbreaking.
Entitled, ``The Holy Face,'' it shows an exhausted, profoundly sad,
almost bewildered Jesus wearing his crown of thorns. Blood trickles
from his head wounds and pools in his eye sockets, turning the
whites to pink. His lips are slightly parted, as if he starts to
say something _ ``Why?'' _ but decides it's useless.
</P>
<P>
   As I moved about the two-room exhibit, it occurred to me that,
in a way, the great slow earthquake of time itself has re-fashioned
so many of St. Francis' things.
</P>
<P>
   A portrait of a woman in a vibrant orange tunic could be of St.
Cecilia or St. Margaret. It was created in the mid-1300s; the I.D.
is lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   Several paintings are but pieces from altars that once spanned
huge churches. A panel from the mid-14th century by Sassotta is but
one of a 27-panel giant that was taken from the high altar of an
Italian church and split up. Now the pieces are scattered to the
winds, in 26 separate collections in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The treasures of St. Francis' basilica will be frustrating and
unsatisfying for those among us who find value in a work only when
we know who painted it or when we can view it intact.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of us, it is more than enough to be among some of
St. Francis' things. Gratefully, we join the millions who've come
before us _ kings, peasants and movie stars _ who felt a mysterious
affinity for a rich kid-turned preacher of peace, love and
humility.

TOO MUCH HOT AIR ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It was late on a Friday afternoon. I was on the
New York Thruway, headed west in blistering heat in a car without
air conditioning. I was drenched in sweat _ something we've all
seen a lot of lately.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the skies darkened, and a monsoon swept over the
highway. It was like driving under Niagara Falls. I pulled off at a
rest area and ducked into the restaurant until the rain lifted.
When I came out, the temperature had dipped about 20 degrees. As I
got back into my car, the guy who'd parked next to me said, ``Hey,
this global warming is getting mean, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, sitting on the deck at my little summer place
on what was becoming a chilly summer evening, I pondered that
stranger's casual, offhand remark. It was one of only dozens I've
heard during this sultry summer of drought and intense, daily heat.
</P>
<P>
   Global warming? Well, what else could be happening here? After
all, wasn't last year the hottest on record worldwide? Haven't the
red-hot 1990s been history's warmest decade?
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that the world is growing warmer because of an
increase in what scientists call greenhouse gases, mainly methane
and carbon dioxide. The theory also is that the increase in
greenhouse gases is largely the result of human activity _ auto
emissions, burning fossil fuels and so on.
</P>
<P>
   There's a problem with the theory, though. Despite what so many
people seem to believe, it could all be hot air.
</P>
<P>
   Weather is what happens this week. Climate is what happens this
millennium. They're related, but hardly the same. Our temperature
records go back only a bit more than a century. The really reliable
records on temperature, the stuff scientists get from satellites,
go back only 25 years or so.
</P>
<P>
   The point is this: we might be in the midst of global warming;
then again, it might merely have been hot lately. In the 1970s, by
the way, it was cold. The winter of 1977 was the coldest on record
_ not that the record is all that extensive.
</P>
<P>
   The other problem is that naturally occurring carbon emissions
outnumber all the emissions caused by humanity by about 30 to one.
In short, if the world's temperature really is rising, can humanity
be playing such a towering, decisive role in that process?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, OK, but if it's really getting warmer, then people must be
having some impact, right? What else could be causing it?
</P>
<P>
   As I sat on that deck, turning all this over in my mind, I was
gazing out over a lake that had been created 14,000 years ago. The
lake had been formed by a glacier receding at the end of the last
ice age.
</P>
<P>
   What caused that ice age to begin with? What caused it to end?
Nobody knows. What we do know is that many relatively quick,
convulsive shifts in world climate took place long before humans
began burning coal or natural gas or cruising around with bad
mufflers. I've found fossils of long-dead oceanic creatures in
slabs of slate along that lakeshore, 714 feet above sea level and
hundreds of miles from salt water.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen thousand years ago, 30 feet of ice covered the current
site of the New York Capitol. In geologic time, that's not even an
eyeblink.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, something might be happening. After all, something has
happened many times in the past. It's not illogical to presume that
it could happen again.
</P>
<P>
   But to presume, as so many people do, that a few hot summers and
mild winters constitute proof that it's definitely happening
doesn't make sense. And to presume that puny humanity has the power
to control it one way or the other makes even less sense than that.

THINKING INSIDE THE BOX 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH SHERMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An amazing turn of events has occurred since the
last time I made a major purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Stores, which formerly raised prices to make up for customers
who steal from them, have apparently decided to eliminate the
middleman and now are stealing directly from you.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuit of a scanner (which I now find I need to do
business), I visited several major electronics and computer stores.
Scanners, used to add pictures, graphics and text to Web sites,
newsletters and other computer-related enterprises, can run
anywhere from around $99 on up to $1,000. In other words, a major
purchase. After strolling around one electronics store, I settled
on a scanner in the $200 range that seemed to have everything I
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   I learned that with the scanner comes a bunch of computer
software and an interface (after all if it doesn't work with your
computer, what you have just purchased is nothing).
</P>
<P>
   I asked mildly intelligent questions about operation and
applications (all those ``-ation'' words that make people think you
know what you're talking about). After breezing through the scant
details on the warranty I suddenly felt my face shoved into a brick
wall as the salesman jovially informed me that if I had to return
the scanner for any reason at all, if it wasn't in an unopened box
they would charge me a 15 percent ``restocking fee.''
</P>
<P>
   What? ``You mean,'' I asked, ``if I go back to my office, try
out the scanner and come back tomorrow to return it because it's
not compatible with my computer, you'll charge me 15 percent?'' (or
$30 on a $200 purchase).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' the man said with a smile. ``How about if I
came back in an hour?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's still 15 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How about a half hour?''
</P>
<P>
   The salesman looked at me as if I were a very small child, with
an extremely limited brain capacity. ``If the package is opened, no
matter when you bring it back or what it is, we still charge you a
15 percent restocking fee.''
</P>
<P>
   My question is, why don't the stores just put their hands
directly in my wallet and pull out what they want NOW (it would
save a lot of time and trouble in the long run).
</P>
<P>
   To me, this is out and out stealing, a real rip-off. Now, I
understand, since this is, after all real life, that there are some
unscrupulous people out there who appear to buy things, but
actually take them home, use them, then return them, in effect
turning a store into a free rental shopping plaza. But I really do
believe that most people are essentially honest, and only return
things back if the do not work.
</P>
<P>
   Every other store I visited in my scanner quest told me that
they, too, have started imposing a restocking fee of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Why do we never read about this? How come these same stores
(which delight in trumpeting their low, low prices) never mention
this little money-taker in their ads?
</P>
<P>
   I know very few people who have ever been able to make a
decision about how well a particular product works without taking
it out of its packaging. But, in the alien world of modern
marketing, this is a talent you must develop, or else the very
bottom line is: You bought it; it's yours forever.

WHY THAT BOTTLE COSTS $50 IN A RESTAURANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the so-so cabernet you shelled out $50 for in that
restaurant last week? And how you felt you'd been taken? Well, if
it makes you feel any better, the winemaker didn't do too well on
the deal, either. He or she probably made about $2.
</P>
<P>
   In the wine trade, that's actually not bad money. Take
Ravenswood, a well-known winery in Sonoma, Calif. Ravenswood has
been making superior wines, mostly zinfandels, for almost 20 years.
Last year the winery, which is publicly traded, posted a net profit
of about $1.5 million on sales of $17 million. With some 131,000
cases of wine sold, that translates into a profit of about 95 cents
a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   The Robert Mondavi Winery, also a public company, netted $29
million, selling just under 6.8 million cases, or some 81.2 million
bottles of wine. Net profit per bottle: 36 cents. Beringer Wine
Estates did a little better, making $29.5 million on about 6
million cases, or 41 cents a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   No need to send any of these people CARE packages. Volume
clearly makes up for any shortcomings in the per-bottle profits.
Even so, it should be evident that no one, at least no one at the
publicly owned wineries, is making a killing in the wine business.
Privately owned wineries do not release their profit figures.
</P>
<P>
   So where did your $50 go? (Closer to $60 with tax and tip.)
Mostly to the restaurant. The winery would have sold it to a
wholesaler _ called a distributor in the liquor business _ for
about $12.50. The distributor then would have marked it up about a
third, selling it to a retailer or to a restaurant for about
$16.50, plus freight and state taxes. The retailer then would sell
it for about $25, and the restaurant for double that, charging you
around $50.
</P>
<P>
   This is called the three-tiered system. Antiquated and costly,
it's part of the liquor laws of almost every state. And there can
be a fourth tier as well. Many larger wine producers hire marketing
companies to augment the efforts of the distributors. Typically, a
marketer will take a five-figure fee for selling a predetermined
number of cases.
</P>
<P>
   It cost the maker of our $50 bottle about $10.50 to produce it.
Wine-making costs are not difficult to understand. First, there are
the grapes. Some wineries use only grapes they have grown
themselves. Big wineries like Mondavi and Beringer own vineyards
and also buy grapes from other growers. Many smaller wineries, like
Ravenswood, buy all their grapes, currently paying $2,000 and more
a ton for the best cabernet sauvignon. Estate-grown or purchased,
grapes can account for up to 25 percent of production costs.
</P>
<P>
   The bottle, cork, label and the capsule around the bottle's neck
would ordinarily account for little more than $1, except at the E.
&AMP; J. Gallo Winery, which makes its own bottles and prints its own
labels. Accounting for the rest of the wine production costs:
barrels, which can cost $600 each, storage costs while the wine is
aging, taxes, marketing and promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, prices, markups and fees are flexible. If a highly
regarded small-production wine, say a Bruno Giacosa barbera from
Italy or a Silver Oak cabernet from California, is much in demand
and only one distributor carries it in a state or city, he may
increase his markup from a third to 40 percent or more. Retailers
and restaurants will pass this increase on to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Once, restaurants simply added 50 percent to the retail price of
a bottle of wine. More commonly now, they double or triple the
retail price. It's no longer surprising to find wines that sell for
$10 in New York wine shops on restaurant lists for $25 to $35. Most
restaurateurs defend high wine prices as a way to hold down the
cost of food and general overhead. But there are restaurants _
Harry's Hanover Square, Sparks Steakhouse and Union Square Cafe, to
cite three in New York _ that consistently offer lower wine prices
than their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Some price increases are unavoidable. Like many serious
restaurateurs, John Foy at the Sonoma Grill in East Rutherford,
N.J., holds his best Bordeaux and California cabernets for three or
four years before selling them. Since he uses bank loans to buy the
wine, he adjusts his prices periodically to cover his interest
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be selling my 1994's for another two years, my 1995's
for three,'' he said. ``I've got to finance my inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with periodic adjustments, Foy said, he hews as closely to
the 50 percent over retail principle as he can. ``When I see some
of the prices in New York restaurants, I feel like saying, `If you
want to hold me up, why don't you just take a gun and ask for my
wallet?''' he said. ``It would be less hypocritical.''
</P>
<P>
   Foy's concerns are not necessarily those of all restaurantgoers,
especially in these good economic times. According to the most
recent restaurant poll conducted by Wine &AMP; Spirits, a consumer
magazine, the average price paid in United States restaurants last
year for cabernet sauvignon was $56 a bottle; for pinot noir, about
$47, and for chardonnay and merlot, about $40.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the average price of the most popular wines in 1998
was $43.59, a 24 percent jump in three years, Wine &AMP; Spirits'
editors said: ``It's beyond inflation and beyond most people's
ability to comprehend.''
</P>
<P>
   So be grateful you got that bottle for $50. At the rate we're
going, next year it may be $75.

RE-CREATING A TASTE OF SUMMER IN LIGURIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pesto has become a staple, especially in late summer when basil
is best, but pasta with pesto does have its limits. The delicious,
strongly flavored sauce must be used in such small quantities that
it adds practically nothing in the way of bulk to the dish. That's
why pasta with pesto is almost always best served as a first
course, the way it is in Italy. It is not substantial enough to
work as a main course.
</P>
<P>
   The Genoese, originators of pesto, must have figured this out
centuries ago, when they created trenette with pesto. Trenette is a
pasta similar to linguine (at one time made with whole-wheat
flour). Trenette with pesto is not as simple as it sounds: the dish
also contains chunks of potatoes and string beans, which make it
more complex, more filling and more interesting than plain pasta
with pesto.
</P>
<P>
   Re-creating the classic dish of Liguria, the region that
includes Genoa, is straightforward and easy. Although most recipes
would have you cook the string beans, potatoes and pasta
separately, this is not only unnecessary, but also a complete waste
of time and energy. If you start the potatoes and pasta
simultaneously, then add the string beans about halfway through
cooking, they will all be finished at the same time and can be
drained and tossed with the sauce in a snap. Admittedly, this
technique is imprecise, but I have had great success with it.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every time I was served this dish in Liguria, the
potatoes were the mealy baking variety, which just about fall apart
as you eat them. I prefer waxier potatoes, like tiny fingerlings
when I can get them or a not especially starchy all-purpose variety
like Yukon gold. Try the dish with whatever you have on hand,
though.
</P>
<P>
   Any kind of string beans will work, although thinner beans, like
delicate, flavorful haricots verts, should be added a minute or two
later than common string beans.
</P>
<P>
   Genoese pesto is very strong. It begins with the local
super-fragrant basil and great-tasting olive oil, goes heavy on
garlic and often includes sharp pecorino cheese in place of the
more common and mellower Parmesan. Any pesto recipe will work with
trenette, though.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, almost every pasta dish in Liguria is served with a
final sprinkling of good olive oil. This one will definitely
benefit from that treatment, especially if the sauce seems dry.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRENETTE WITH PESTO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 cups basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, peeled
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   { cup grated pecorino romano or other hard sheep's-milk cheese
</P>
<P>
   { cup extra virgin olive oil, or more
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons pine nuts
</P>
<P>
   2 medium potatoes, about { pound, peeled and cut into {-inch
cubes
</P>
<P>
   1 pound trenette or linguine
</P>
<P>
   { pound string beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch lengths.
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt it. Combine
the basil, garlic, salt and cheese in a blender or food processor;
pulse until roughly chopped. Add the olive oil in a steady stream,
and continue to blend until the mixture is fairly creamy, adding a
little more olive oil or some water if necessary. Add the pine
nuts, and pulse a few times to chop them into the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add the potatoes to the boiling water, and stir; then add the
pasta, and cook as usual, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes in
all. When the pasta is about half done _ the strands will bend but
are not yet tender _ add the string beans.
</P>
<P>
   3. When the pasta is done, the potatoes and beans should be
tender. Drain the pasta and vegetables, toss with pesto and more
salt or olive oil if you like, and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Clamming is a primordial experience. All it involves
is walking slowly in the ocean at low tide, bending over and
groping in the sediment in search of a hard, slightly rounded
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Clamming requires no equipment, except maybe a bucket. It
demands no talent, except a notion of where the clams are. Like
fishing, trapping and hunting, it is one of the most ancient ways
to gather food.
</P>
<P>
   The laziest clammers, like me, meet a clam on its own rhythmic
terms. We burrow together. I wade into two feet of water, sit down
and grope about in the mud. Others are more energetic, or better
equipped.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Thompson, a retired banker who clams in Huntington Bay, on
the North Shore of Long Island, uses a rake and carries a wire
basket on a float to keep his catch alive. Tom Colicchio, executive
chef at Gramercy Tavern in Manhattan, learned at age 3 to feel for
clams with his feet and take along a bushel basket to float in an
inner tube.
</P>
<P>
   Professional clammers work year round using hydraulic dredges or
a 20-foot-long implement known as a bull rake. Amateurs usually do
their clamming by hand in summer, when the water is soft and warm
and the surf a mere ruffle. On the East Coast, all search for three
kinds of clams.
</P>
<P>
   The hardshell clam is known locally as the Northern quahog (or
Mercenaria mercenaria, from the days when the Indians used the
shells as wampum). Littlenecks (1{ inches across), topnecks (2
inches) cherrystones (2{ inches) and chowders (3{ inches) are all
quahogs, at different ages and stages of tenderness. The
fragile-shelled steamer clam is also local, as are slender razor
clams, about 3 inches long and an inch wide.
</P>
<P>
   The Encyclopedia Britannica calls clams ``boring bivalves,'' but
if their lives are monotonous, their afterlives certainly aren't.
They have a sweet briny flavor and a pleasing chewiness that makes
them irresistible raw with a squeeze of lemon, or steamed in white
wine with garlic and parsley or, in the simplest of sandwiches,
batter-fried and stuffed into a soft roll with tartar sauce,
lettuce and tomato.
</P>
<P>
   Clams probably spend more time in chowders than anyplace else,
and these days the choice is no longer between just creamy New
England and red Manhattan. At Gramercy Tavern, Colicchio makes a
chowder with leeks, fingerling potatoes and onions (and ramps, in
season), heightening it with fresh, lemony sorrel.
</P>
<P>
   And at the Lobster Club, Anne Rosenzweig steams clams in white
wine, olive oil and garlic, reserving the broth to add to her
classic creamy New England chowder, along with scallions and
kernels of fresh, sweet milky corn.
</P>
<P>
   Clams reveal their origin when it comes time to cook them. They
need to be scrubbed seriously to get rid of all the grit they have
been burrowing in. And they need to come out of their shells.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to open a clam is to steam it until the shell
pops open; prying it open with a knife is dangerous for the
inexperienced. Most shops will sell clams shucked as long as they
are to be eaten or cooked within the hour. Otherwise, customers are
advised to take them home closed.
</P>
<P>
   Clams should be kept uncovered and dry on the bottom shelf of
the refrigerator, where the temperature is 38 to 40 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Digging your own, though, gives instant gratification. In 20
minutes, in a densely populated clam colony, a lazy clammer can dig
up 48 clams, just the right amount for most chowder recipes.
</P>
<P>
   A $5 license from town hall in Huntington, for example, allows
an amateur clammer to gather half a bushel of shellfish a day,
including no more than 100 hardshell clams. Not a bad price for
shopping in nature's store. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Though many Americans are eager to cook Asian dishes at home,
the thought of navigating an Asian grocery store is a different
story. For a non-Asian it can be bewildering territory full of
pungent aromas, packages with labels in Chinese, Japanese, Thai,
Korean or Vietnamese and odd-looking specimens you don't know
whether to eat or to plant.
</P>
<P>
   At last, there is a book that takes you by the hand and gives a
clear and fascinating tour of these markets. It couldn't have a
better title, ``The Asian Grocery Store Demystified'' (Renaissance
Books, $14.95).
</P>
<P>
   The author, Linda Bladholm, begins by describing the layout of
an Asian grocery in her neighborhood in Miami. As she explains,
there is indeed an order to these markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asian markets are generally stocked according to the
principles of balance,'' she writes. ``Hot, spicy, chili sauces and
curry pastes are all in one place; salty items are together in one
row, and bitter, sour, or sweet things are in other sections.''
That explanation changed my entire perspective, making these
markets seem more manageable and interesting.
</P>
<P>
   I took Ms. Bladholm's book with me on an excursion to Chinatown
in Manhattan. The streets were filled with produce vendors,
children squatting on the sidewalk and women carrying bags full of
vibrant greens.
</P>
<P>
   Every vendor I passed sold these greens, which had long pointy
leaves. I paused at one and turned to the vegetable section of the
book. A simple illustration told me the green was water spinach, a
member of the sweet potato family that is also called ong-choy or
kangkong. The book also told me which part is edible, what it
tastes like and how it is used. Ms. Bladholm's descriptions are so
clear that I was able to identify every single one the vendor had
on display, including those without illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   I continued on to a large Asian grocery store. My first visit
there had left me feeling overwhelmed and defeated. This time I
spent two hours, guide in hand, meandering up and down the rows.
</P>
<P>
   As I made my way, I saw, smelled and learned about dried Chinese
yam, dried oysters and fermented bean curd. I spotted sweet
jackfruit, thinking I had found something truly unusual. But there
it was in the index, in three different forms. With many items,
like dried shrimp, won-ton wrappers and sesame oil, Ms. Bladholm
lists brands she likes. Finding them on the shelves gave
credibility to the book and reassured me.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, I had to use my powers of deduction. With a bottle
labeled ``Banana Catsup,'' for instance, I had to assume it was the
banana sauce written about in the condiments sections. In it, she
points out its similarities in taste and use to ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   I ran into problems when foods had impossibly vague labels, like
``dried herb.'' In these cases, no guide could help.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bladholm's book, as slim as a paperback, kept surprising me
with its depth. Consider the noodle section. While describing the
differences between various wheat, rice and egg noodles, she also
helps you understand how each fits into a particular Asian cuisine,
including important cultural information like the fact that noodles
are meant to be slurped and that cutting them is considered to be
bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   In the tea section, she slips in a paragraph about how tea is
made and how it is graded, and another on tea ceremonies. Under
sugar cane, she describes how the juice is served as a drink
throughout Asia, and how the cane is used to tenderize tripe in
Bali. There is also a small but eclectic group of recipes.
</P>
<P>
   If I would change anything about this practical book, it would
be to make it spiral bound so you could flip to sections and not
have the book close shut as you juggle jars and bags, trying to
read the labels.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bladholm not only sorts out the cultural context of an Asian
grocery store, but does it in such a way that makes you hungry to
return.

A STEP BACK IN TIME IN ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOAN NATHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAJAR, Israel _ One sultry summer day, members of a tour group
stopped for lunch in this ancient dusty village near the Lebanese
border. To American members of the group, it seemed that time
itself had stopped, too.
</P>
<P>
   The scene could have been one described in the Bible. The
visitors were seated in a shady garden surrounded by lemon,
pomegranate, plum, olive and fig trees, grape vines, mulberries
(called white berries or tree berries in Israel), zinnias,
marigolds and geraniums. Village women carried plates heaped high
with flavorful vegetarian fritters called kibbe, as well as olives,
tabbouleh, hummus and labneh, which is strained yogurt. For
dessert, anise-flavored cookies fried in olive oil were served with
fresh fruit and tea with dried ginger, aniseed, cinnamon and cumin.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the village, residents were busy drying and
preserving summer's bounty for winter's larder _ making cheese,
preparing grains _ in much the way their ancestors had for
centuries. Most of the 1,700 people here are Alawites, an offshoot
of Shiite Islam. Most Alawites live in northern Syria, southern
Turkey and parts of Lebanon, Iraq and Iran. But when Rajar, which
had been part of Syria, was captured by Israel in the Middle East
war of 1967, half of Rajar's Alawites decided to stay. They stayed
in spite of the fact that the village had no electricity or running
water.
</P>
<P>
   Today, things are a bit better _ there is electricity,
television and a pump from the nearby Wazzani Spring, which sends
water to the homes _ but the modern world intrudes in the form of
barbed wire and Israeli guns, aimed at Hezbollah guerrillas in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In Rajar, like other somewhat poor, isolated Middle Eastern
villages, life goes on pretty much the way it has for decades. Most
of the men in the village work in construction and in factories in
nearby towns in Israel. The women tend to the home fires _ and the
occasional bus load of tourists _ using centuries-old cooking
methods.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the villagers cook vegetarian fare; meat like
lamb, beef or fowl is scarce and eaten only on special occasions.
During the fall, when the river runs high, they add fresh fish to
their diet.
</P>
<P>
   The women make a yogurt cheese called shanklish, which resembles
a saltier mozzarella before it is dried and then rolled in za'atar,
a spice mix. They dry the labneh and press it into little balls to
be stored for the winter in olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Rajar is a mill town, and has long been known for its bulgur,
cracked wheat that is rinsed in several changes of water and boiled
until partly cooked. Then it is dried in the sun on large sheets on
the rooftops of flat stone houses. During the weeklong drying
period, the women occasionally ascend the rooftops to separate the
grains with their fingers. Then the grains are taken down and
shelled, and then crushed to the required fineness at the mill in
the village.
</P>
<P>
   The larger grains, about the size of broken rice, are used for
mujeddra, a lentil and bulgur stew with sauteed onions. (In other
parts of the Middle East, rice replaces bulgur in this dish.)
Smaller kernels of bulgur are used for tabbouleh and kibbe, both
the meat and vegetarian versions. The finest grade of bulgur,
called jerisheh, is used for a breakfast cereal. Large sacks of the
different textures of bulgur _ along with tomatoes, garlic, avocado
and zucchini _ are kept in the storeroom next to the kitchen for
use throughout the long winter.
</P>
<P>
   Adiba Kahmuz, the mother of 12 children, sat under a fig tree in
the backyard of her cinder-block house, kneading a kind of gruel
made from fine bulgur mixed with labneh, salt and aniseed. She
would later form small balls called kishk, which are brought to the
rooftop to dry in the sun for seven days. This convenience food is
stored to be eaten throughout the winter as snacks, often mixed
with garlic, za'atar and onion, and soaked with water to make a
gruel, soup or a sauce for meat dishes. (In the United States,
kishk is available as a powdered, yogurt-based mix and sold in
stores that carry Middle Eastern products.)
</P>
<P>
   One of her sons, Mahmoud, started the family business of feeding
tour groups. At about 1 p.m. on the days the visitors arrive, the
women start kneading the dough for the kibbe and making the hummus,
which they sprinkle with sweet red pepper. Crouched down on stone
floors, the women mix the ingredients and dish them out on flat
plates to serve to their guests.
</P>
<P>
   In making these dishes, which except for the addition of
potatoes are as old as the region from which they come, they were
teaching the visitors to take a deep breath and go a step back in
time. The tourists seemed to relish the opportunity.

   There are so many ways we eat fruit in summer _ cascading over
shortcake, gorgeously paving tarts and pies. But there is one thing
we almost never do to summer fruit: roast it.
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad, because the intense heat reduces the sugary
juices and concentrates the flavors. The flesh softens into
something just this side of a compote but leaves the shape of the
pieces intact.
</P>
<P>
   All of this makes roasted fruit the perfect complement for a
simple cake. This dessert is based on an English summer pudding, a
layered confection of bread and fruit compote that's weighted and
chilled.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of bread, I used a fine-textured vanilla cake. The
vanilla brings out the sweetness of the fruit, and to be sure it
doesn't get lost in all that voluptuousness, I add the extract and
a touch of the bean itself.
</P>
<P>
   For the fruit, I use a mixture of sliced peaches and
blueberries, which reach their peak ripeness at the same time and
don't need a lot of added sugar. And cooked together, their color
is a purply blue with just a sunset smattering of red, orange and
gold.
</P>
<P>
   After layering slices of cake with the roasted fruit, I chill it
for several hours. The cake absorbs the delicious roasting pan
juices, bonding with the fruit. It is at its best after eight to 24
hours, but you can make it up to two days ahead. The longer it
sits, the moister it becomes, but after two days, it begins turning
to mush.
</P>
<P>
   I like to serve this cake with a few slices of raw peach and a
sprinkling of blueberries. Dressed in a light lemony glaze, they
make a toothsome contrast to the tender cake. Add a drizzle of the
pan juices, a generous dollop of whipped cream and a sprig of mint
_ what's not to like?
</P>
<P>
   ROASTED PEACHES AND BLUEBERRIES WITH VANILLA CAKE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1{ hours, plus 8 hours' chilling
</P>
<P>
   6 large ripe peaches, pitted and sliced
</P>
<P>
   6 cups blueberries
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   \ vanilla bean
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons butter in small pieces
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1 cup flour
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   { cup milk
</P>
<P>
   Whipped clabbered or heavy cream, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Mint sprigs, for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 500 degrees. In a bowl, place peaches,
blueberries, 1 cup of the sugar and the lemon juice; toss to coat
well. Pour all but 2 cups of the fruit into a 9-by-13-inch baking
dish. Cover reserved fruit and refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   2. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean, and reserve. Bury the vanilla
pod in the fruit in the baking dish, and arrange 4 tablespoons of
the butter pieces on top. Bake for 30 minutes, stirring after about
15 minutes. Let cool on a rack; discard vanilla pod.
</P>
<P>
   3. Lower oven temperature to 350 degrees. Grease and flour a
9-inch round cake pan. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with
the paddle attachment, cream remaining sugar and butter until very
smooth. Beat in the eggs, vanilla extract and vanilla seeds. In a
small bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. On low speed,
add flour mixture to the batter in three stages, alternating with
the milk. Pour batter into the prepared pan, and bake for 25
minutes, until a tester inserted into middle comes out clean. Let
cool, then unmold cake.
</P>
<P>
   4. With a long serrated knife, carefully slice cake horizontally
into three layers. Line a clean 9-inch cake pan with plastic wrap,
leaving plenty of wrap overhanging. Place bottom layer of cake in
pan, cut side up. Using a slotted spoon, layer half of the cooled
fruit over cake. Top with middle layer of cake, and spoon on
remaining fruit; reserve fruit juices. Cover with the top cake
layer, cut side down. Press down gently on cake and cover with the
overhanging plastic wrap. Chill cake for at least 8 hours,
preferably overnight.
</P>
<P>
   5. When ready to serve, unmold cake and garnish each slice with
a generous drizzle of the reserved fruit juices, the reserved raw
fruit and a dollop of whipped cream. Top with mint sprigs.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 10 to 12 servings.

   Bill and Hillary are, by any definition, one of history's most
remarkable couples: he the irrepressible country-boy populist
oozing ambition and Southern charm, she the brilliant lawyer with a
taste for power and, in the end, an unshakable allegiance to the
man in her life.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Bill and Hillary Clinton scaled the heights of power
and prestige, only to have his wantonly reckless behavior bring
them to the brink of personal and political ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the billions of words that have been written about Bill
and Hillary, the true nature of their relationship remains a
jealously guarded secret.
</P>

   Until now.

   _ What really goes on in the private residence at the White
House, including the stormy clash between the president and the
first lady when he finally confessed his adultery to her.

seller ``Bill and Hillary: The Marriage'' (William Morrow &AMP; Co.,
Inc.) written by Christopher Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   -------------------------------------------------
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Hillary are, by any definition, one of history's most
remarkable couples: he the irrepressible country-boy populist
oozing ambition and Southern charm, she the brilliant lawyer with a
taste for power and, in the end, an unshakable allegiance to the
man in her life.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Bill and Hillary Clinton scaled the heights of power
and prestige, only to have his wantonly reckless behavior bring
them to the brink of personal and political ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the billions of words that have been written about Bill
and Hillary, the true nature of their relationship remains a
jealously guarded secret.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times Syndicate is offering for purchase three
searing excerpts from Christopher Andersen's latest tome, ```Bill
and Hillary: The Marriage.'' Andersen, a former contributing editor
of Time and senior editor of People, has written over 20 books,
including ``The Day Diana Died'' and ``Jack and Jackie.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the revelations in the excerpts:
</P>
<P>
   _ What really goes on in the private residence at the White
House, including the stormy clash between the president and the
first lady when he finally confessed his adultery to her.
</P>
<P>
   _ The real reason why Clinton chose to withdraw from the race
for the presidency in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   _ The true nature of Hillary's relationship with Vince Foster.
</P>
<P>
   WATCH THE WIRE FOR MORE DETAILS!

WINE OF THE WEEK

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Cetamura Chianti, Badia a Coltibuono 1997, Tuscany, Italy.
About $10. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   So many good wines are coming out of Italy these days that it's
hard to keep up with them. Unfortunately, many have only two of the
three basic requirements for relatively little-known wines: quality
and a reasonable price. The third leg of the stool is availability.
Fortunately, Cetamura, from Badia a Coltibuono, a prominent Chianti
producer, is quite widely distributed. Less impressive than
Coltibuono's better Chiantis, Cetamura is nevertheless a
delightfully rounded everyday red wine with an array of rich
flavors, good concentration and lots of fruit. It's a classic
Chianti, composed of sangiovese and canaiolo, the essential Chianti
grapes. An easygoing, uncomplicated red for late summer and fall.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steaming corn on the cob is gentle, fast and virtually
foolproof. It seems pure and perfect. But grilling corn on the cob
manages the seemingly impossible: it makes the corn even better.
The fire imparts a smoke flavor and intensifies the corn's
sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   But the best way to grill is a matter of debate. The only
important question is whether to grill the corn in the husk or
stripped bare and exposed directly to the heat. Everything else is
nuance.
</P>
<P>
   Some grill aficionados argue that the husk keeps the corn moist
and juicy, protecting the delicate kernels from being scorched.
Proponents of husk-off grilling contend that exposing the ears to
live coals brings out sweetness by caramelizing the corn's natural
sugars. It also opens up the corn to smoke, giving it powerful
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Corn without its husk needs some form of lubrication, like a
quick brush of olive oil or butter, to keep it moist. In the husk,
it needs to be soaked before grilling to keep the green covering
from totally going up in smoke.
</P>
<P>
   When buying corn for grilling, pick out the largest, fattest
ears and feel them to be sure the cob is filled out with plump
kernels all the way to the pointed tip.
</P>
<P>
   Corn grillers in Lynchburg, Tenn., have soaking down to a
science. Regina Qualls, the Metro Moore County Volunteer Fire
Department treasurer, who is an 11-year veteran of corn-roast
find-raisers, described how the corn is soaked in salted water for
24 hours to make the ears more tender. Ice is added to the salt
water every few hours to keep it from souring. The ears are then
grilled over blazing-hot charcoal until the husks are as charred as
cinders. When those are pulled off, the plump roasted kernels are
exceptionally succulent, thanks to the salty water.
</P>
<P>
   Nitzy Rabin, the chef and owner of Chillingsworth and Greenhouse
Bistro, in Brewster, on Cape Cod, takes the middle ground on the
husk question. He strips off the outside layers to allow some of
the smoke and grill flavor to penetrate to the kernels; the inner
layers are left on to keep the kernels from burning. Before
grilling, he also cuts off and discards the tassel of silk that
extends from the end. The burned husk and silk can be stripped off
afterward. (Wear clean garden gloves to protect your hands if the
corn is hot.)
</P>
<P>
   Pat Garland, a food stylist and caterer in Manhattan, has a more
ingenious presentation. She shucks the ears the way you'd peel a
banana, by pulling back the husks from top to bottom, but leaves
them attached to the base of the cob. She then ties them back with
string, so that the husk forms a sort of handle that makes it easy
to hold the ear as it is eaten.
</P>
<P>
   She brushes the corn with olive oil or butter and grills it over
a hot fire until the kernels are dark golden brown. (Be sure to
position the husk away from the fire.) You may even hear the
kernels crackle.
</P>
<P>
   This method _ minus the husk, of course _ can also be used by
the grill-deprived for broiling corn.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to struggle with the silk after the corn is
grilled, carefully pull back the husks, leaving them attached at
the base, strip out the silk, then pull the husks back over the
ears. Soak the ears in cold water for an hour or so: that way, the
husks will stay in place as they cook.
</P>
<P>
   In Oaxaca, Mexico, corn is traditionally grilled without the
husk by street vendors who cook the ears until smoky and golden
over charcoal-burning braziers. But in truth, it's the
accompaniments that set this grilled corn apart: first a slathering
of mayonnaise, then a coat of salty grated cheese, and finally,
tongue-tingling blasts of chili powder and fresh lime juice. The
combination sounds strange, but quickly becomes addictive.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRINIDADIAN GRILLED CORN WITH GARLIC CILANTRO BUTTER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>

HOUSTON SEEKS TO CURB RACIAL PROFILING BY POLICE OFFICERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trim) 
(Attn: Calif., N.J., N.Y. and Pa.) 
 
By S.K. BARDWELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A new program aimed at ensuring Houston police
officers don't engage in racial profiling will be unveiled
Wednesday by Mayor Lee Brown and Police Chief C.O. Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the announcement, which coincides with visits to
the National Urban League conference by high-profile minority
rights advocates Johnnie Cochran and the Rev. Al Sharpton, has
brought claims from some officers that the program is just
political lip-service to a ``hot'' issue.
</P>
<P>
   Other officers, though, said the plan is farsighted and will be
copied in the coming months by law enforcement agencies all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Racial profiling is the practice of putting people under
criminal suspicion based on their race.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford declined to talk about the new program, saying he
preferred to answer questions about it at Wednesday's news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo last week, Houston Police Department Capt. David F.
Cutler outlined the methods HPD intends to use to eliminate racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Self-Initiated Police Contact Database Fact Sheets will be
filled out by officers every time they perform a ``self-initiated
investigative contact/stop,'' the memo states.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if the officer, based on his or her own
judgment, stops to talk to someone either because they appear to
have a problem or because they appear to be a problem, the officer
must fill out the form on a mobile computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   Information that has to be entered on the form includes the
date, time and location of the contact, the reason for the contact,
the disposition of the contact, and the age, race and sex of the
person contacted.
</P>
<P>
   The reports will be used to form a database from which reports
will be generated for review by Bradford, police managers and the
Internal Affairs Division, the memo states. Those reports will be
used to identify officers who may be practicing racial profiling.
The memo did not state what actions would be taken toward officers
suspected of profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Several patrol officers who read the memo and commented on it in
return for anonymity said they believe the new report will have two
effects on patrol officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction, and I think the reaction of a lot of
officers, is going to be, `OK, I'm not going to do these stops
anymore,''' said one officer.
</P>
<P>
   Another officer agreed: ``If I see a guy who maybe looks like
he's lost, or someone who looks like he's lurking somewhere he
shouldn't be, I might not stop and talk to him now, because most of
those turn out to be nothing, and then I'm going to have to fill
out this form for five or 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   A third officer pointed out another problem the forms may
create: ``If I do stop you, and you're black or Hispanic, I'm going
to try real hard to find something to give you a ticket for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise I may have (Internal Affairs) coming around later
saying I must have just stopped you to hassle you because you were
black or Hispanic _ if you'd been doing anything wrong, why didn't
I give you a ticket or arrest you?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Some older officers say the forms are reminiscent of the field
interrogation cards used by many departments, although not HPD, in
the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Those 3-by-5 index cards were used to record the names and
addresses of people officers talked to on the streets, and then
were sometimes used to round up suspects when a crime was committed
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The cards were put aside amid outrage from the minority
community, whose members made up the vast majority of the cards'
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several officers said the new reports are probably the result of
Bradford ``looking down the road,'' as one officer put it.
</P>
<P>
   Although racial profiling has been an issue for years, several
recent events have brought renewed attention to the matter.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation is still under way in the February death of
Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant who died when four
New York City police officers, apparently mistaking him for someone
else, fired 41 bullets at him.
</P>
<P>
   Two New York City police officers have been convicted of
sodomizing and torturing Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant, while
he was being held for questioning in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In December in Riverside, Calif., police shot a black woman in
the back with 12 bullets as she sat in her car.
</P>
<P>
   In Pittsburgh in the same month, a police officer shot a black
man in a chase. The officer said he feared being run over, but his
reasoning was undermined by the finding that the motorist had been
shot through the driver's side window.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman fired the state
police chief after he said blacks commit more crimes. State police
there were already under attack for allegedly using a racial
profile to stop motorists on the New Jersey Turnpike, a major
drug-trafficking corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Those incidents and others prompted President Clinton in June to
direct federal law enforcement agencies to begin collecting
information on the race, age and sex of people they detain, as a
first step toward determining whether minorities are unfairly
targeted for scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called on state and local police forces, which
operate outside federal jurisdiction, to begin collecting
information about who is being detained and why.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next step is clear,'' said one Houston police officer.
``Departments that don't start collecting this information,
bringing themselves into line with the feds, are going to lose
their asset forfeiture funding.''
</P>
<P>
   When local law enforcement agencies conduct police operations
jointly with federal agencies such as the DEA or FBI, and assets
are seized from a suspect, the local agency receives a portion of
those assets back. In Houston, that funding makes up millions of
dollars per year.

 &HT;    FIRST TASK FOR NEW RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER: A NEW WAR
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In his first full day Tuesday as Russia's latest prime
minister, Vladimir Putin faced an ominous challenge bigger the the
political turmoil that delivered him to his job. He set out to
avert a broader war with Islamic militants in the southern border
region.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim insurgents declared Russia's Dagestan republic an
independent state on Tuesday and called for a holy war against the
Moscow-aligned government. The fighting is Russia's worst security
crisis since the disastrous, two-year war in the breakaway republic
of Chechnya, which ended in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A day after his appointment as acting prime minister, Putin was
summoned to the Kremlin by President Boris Yeltsin to devise a plan
to quell the uprising in Dagestan, which reportedly is being
orchestrated by guerrilla leaders crossing over from neighboring
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Order will be established within the next few days,'' Putin
declared.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who was also tapped by Yeltsin as his chosen heir to run
for president in elections next year, must still be confirmed by
the Communist-dominated parliament -- which is scheduled to meet on
Monday to consider his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the widespread criticism in Russia of Yeltsin's decision
to name the little-known Putin as his fifth prime minister in less
than two years, his chances of a swift approval appear good,
according to parliamentary leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting in Dagestan, a remote, mountainous province on the
Caspian Sea, intensified in the past four days as heavily armed
Islamic commandos last weekend captured several key villages.
Thousands of local residents have fled their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Russian troops, backed by jet fighter-bombers,
helicopter gunships and heavy artillery, regained two villages and
surrounded guerrilla forces in two others on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger issue is not real estate, however, but anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, whom Putin replaced
after only 82 days in office, warned Monday that Russia could lose
control of the Caucasus Mountain province, as it did in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Russian officials bolstered security in Moscow and
other major cities against what they called an increased threat of
terrorism, yet another sign of the degree of concern Russian
officials have for the situation in the south and their fear that
it could spread.
</P>
<P>
   Dagestan has long been the site of clashes between Russian
forces and armed clans in a spillover from the fighting in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But the intensified fighting, combined with the uncertainty over
Yeltsin's latest political maneuvers in Moscow by appointing Putin,
puts more pressure on the novice prime minister to quickly resolve
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said Russia was confronted with ``violations of the law
and manifestations of terrorism'' in Dagestan. ``We cannot see such
a state of affairs in Russia's as tolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake is national pride. Russia, with its chronically ill
economy and weakened army, does not want to see its southern
territories nibbled away in savage guerrilla wars. Also at stake is
petroleum. Dagestan and other unstable southern provinces lay along
the pipeline route to the oil-rich Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Air force commander Anatoly Kornukov told a Moscow news
conference Tuesday that Russian forces would engage in
search-and-destroy missions to root out the guerrilla fighters.
</P>
<P>
   He said the militants should not be allowed to flee back into
Chechnya, where they could regroup. ``The gangs must be destroyed,
as they take no pity on anyone,'' Kornukov said.
</P>
<P>
   The insurgents, with a declared aim of establishing an Islamic
state in Dagestan, are believed to number in the hundreds, though
one press report from the region said as many as 1,500
reinforcements were being dispatched from Chechnya. Two well-known
Chechen field commanders, Shamil Basayev and a Jordanian-born
leader known only as Hattab, were leading the weekend assaults in
Dagestan, according to refugees fleeing the area.
</P>
<P>
   The number of casualties in the recent fighting was unclear.
Military chief of staff Anatoly Kvashnin told Putin that Russian
forces nearly had the situation under control. But Russian military
officials made similar confident predictions at the outset of the
war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and Chechen forces fought a bloody war that ended when
Russia unilaterally withdrew its troops in 1996 and Chechnya
declared independence. Although Moscow continues to consider
Chechnya part of the Russian Federation, it has been powerless to
assert its will over the largely lawless province.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen officials have denied that guerrillas being led and
supplied from Chechnya have incited the fighting in Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   ``One war is enough for us, we now want to create and construct
rather than doom our people to destruction,'' Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov told reporters in the capital, Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, 46, is a reserved former spy and security chief who
analysts believe will bring to bear sufficient firepower to at
least suppress, for the time being, a wider conflict along the
troubled southern border.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the presidential campaign of 2000, Russia's policy in
the Northern Caucasus will most likely get tougher. This is true,
above all, because the future president obviously will be required
to propose and implement an ultimate rather than intermediate
solution,'' said Aleksei Malashenko, an analyst with the Carnegie
Moscow Center, a think tank.

 &HT;    AIRLINE PASSENGERS DOUBLE THEIR COMPLAINTS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Growing discontent in the crowded skies have caused
complaints about airline service to more than double from a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 5,005 complaints were lodged against the major
carriers in the first six month of this year, the U.S. Department
of Transportation said Tuesday. Last year, the count was 2,467.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing air travel dissatisfaction is due to flight
delays caused by unusually severe weather and air traffic jams,
cramped and overbooked airplanes, and hours spent in airport lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's backed up, and everyone's just getting stressed
out,'' said David S. Stempler, founder of the Air Travelers
Association, a Washington-based advocacy group. ``It's like
cornered animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers often reported that their bad experiences were made
worse by airline workers who were discourteous, arrogant or poorly
informed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the complaints in the Transportation Department's latest
report, to be released this week:
</P>
<P>
   _ A passenger said he was ``imprisoned in the airplane on the
runway'' for three hours in Philadelphia last spring and then
treated ``rudely'' by a Delta Airlines ticket agent when he finally
reached Atlanta, where he missed his connection.
</P>
<P>
   _ In an airport packed with delayed and disgruntled passengers,
a passenger made a cell phone call to U.S. Airways and learned that
his flight had been canceled, even as the gate agent was still
insisting the flight would take off at 6:45 p.m. Fed up, he wrote,
``I rented a car and drove 4 hours'' from Jacksonville to Tampa,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   _ A professional musician, who flew from Atlanta to San Diego,
said a baggage agent barely glanced at the gash in his saxophone,
denied the claim and then told him to ``shut up'' so he could
return to his computer.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, after Northwest Airlines kept a planeload of
passengers on a Detroit runway for eight hours in a snowstorm
without working toilets or food, Congress threatened to enact a
passengers' rights law. But the lawmakers backed down in June when
the major airlines issued a voluntary ``airline customer service
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Cronan, spokeswoman for the Air Transport Association, the
trade group for the major carriers, said the airlines are working
on improvements, especially in employee training and reservations
systems. But she said major improvements were not expected until
December, when the plans are supposed to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   The pledges do not go far enough, said Stempler, the passenger
advocate. ``It's not going to get to the heart of the complaints
that I hear every day, which is the seats are too narrow, there's
no leg room, the planes are crowded, and service has gone
downhill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Salfen, director of consumer affairs for the International
Airline Passengers Association, hears the same from his members
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what happened to the ``friendly'' skies of past airline
commercials, he said, ``They're gone, because the whole mind set of
the people who serve the public is completely different.''
Customers are no longer treated with the same deference, he said.
``It's not only the airlines. It's everywhere we go.''
</P>
<P>
   Airlines have fared better, with profits soaring along with
planes that take off with an average 70 percent of the seats filled
by a flying public that has increased by 25 percent in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Executives, including Continental Airlines's chairman Gordon
Bethune, are blaming the nation's antiquated air traffic system,
which often causes delays and cancellations, even in clear weather.
</P>
<P>
   Stempler agreed. ``The ultimate culprit is really the (Federal
Aviation Administration) and the Congress for failing to provide
sufficient aviation infrastructure to deal with these loads,'' he
said.

trade group for the major carriers, said the airlines are working
on improvements, especially in employee training and reservations
systems. But she said major improvements were not expected until
December, when the plans are supposed to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   The pledges do not go far enough, said Stempler, the passenger
advocate. ``It's not going to get to the heart of the complaints
that I hear every day, which is the seats are too narrow, there's
no leg room, the planes are crowded, and service has gone
downhill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Salfen, director of consumer affairs for the International
Airline Passengers Association, hears the same from his members
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what happened to the ``friendly'' skies of past airline
commercials, he said, ``They're gone, because the whole mind set of
the people who serve the public is completely different.''
Customers are no longer treated with the same deference, he said.
``It's not only the airlines. It's everywhere we go.''
</P>
<P>
   Airlines have fared better, with profits soaring along with
planes that take off with an average 70 percent of the seats filled
by a flying public that has increased by 25 percent in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Executives, including Continental Airlines's chairman Gordon
Bethune, are blaming the nation's antiquated air traffic system,
which often causes delays and cancellations, even in clear weather.
</P>
<P>
   Stempler agreed. ``The ultimate culprit is really the (Federal
Aviation Administration) and the Congress for failing to provide
sufficient aviation infrastructure to deal with these loads,'' he
said.

HOOVER'S FINEST HOUR WASN'T IN THE WHITE HOUSE

<P>
   DANVILLE, Calif. _ Tuesday was the birthday of one of the most
popular presidents ever elected _ the tough-minded,
straight-shooting winner of what at the time was the biggest
landslide in American history.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the birthday of a president who, by the end of his
term, had become one of the nation's least popular leaders and
loser of the second most one-sided presidential election. Happy
birthday, Herbert Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   The Hoover presidency (1929-1933), which saw America plunge from
prosperity to the depths of depression, is widely regarded as an
utter disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hoover fans (a small group) admit his term ended with
Americans cursing his name _ or using it as an insult: A ``Hoover
flag'' was an empty pocket turned inside-out; a ``Hoover blanket''
was a newspaper. A ``Hoover villa'' was a latrine.
</P>
<P>
   Yet 15 years earlier, ``Hooverizing'' _ going wheatless and
meatless one day a week to support the troops fighting World War I
_ had been something the country was proud to do, and proud of the
man who had set it up.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover, back then, was a hero. What went wrong?
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong reveals how a good brain and a good heart _ and
a good resume _ do not necessarily add up to a good president.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover's intellect was slow to reveal itself. Born in 1874 to
Quaker parents who died before he was 10, he was the youngest
student at brand-new (and tuition-free) Stanford University. Hoover
nearly flunked English. He failed German. He was mediocre in
geology, his major.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he became, over time, a brilliant mining engineer.
By 1914, when war broke out, he was a millionaire, every penny
self-earned.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover could have easily used the war to add to his personal
fortune. Instead, embarking on what he called ``the slippery road
of public life,'' he singlehandedly organized the Committee for the
Relief of Belgium, bringing food to starving Belgians trapped
behind German lines. A complex effort undependably funded
(sometimes privately, sometimes publicly, sometimes by Hoover
himself), unprecedented in scale and wrought with annoyance (some
Belgians, to Hoover's fury, sold their rations to the Germans), the
committee brought bread and hope to at least 9 million French and
Belgian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   When America joined the war in April 1917, Hoover became U.S.
food administrator. With the same zeal he'd used overseas _ ``Do
not help the Hun at meal time!'' _ he organized large-scale
voluntary food drives. He promoted thrift by asking cooks to
replace meat with fish and to keep pigs instead of dogs (this never
caught on). It was an easy job to do wrong; Hoover did it right.
</P>
<P>
   The period after World War I was Hoover's finest hour. Returning
to Europe as head of the American Relief Administration, he so
efficiently oversaw aid distribution he became known, both here and
abroad, as the ``Great Humanitarian.''
</P>
<P>
   Insistent that help go to all who needed it, he fed Red and
White Russians alike; he even fed the defeated Germans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young man,'' said a British admiral, ``I don't see why you
Americans want to feed these Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Old man,'' Hoover replied, ``I don't see why you British want
to starve women and children after they have surrendered.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home, as secretary of Commerce _ a nice gig during the
booming '20s _ Hoover made headlines when the Mississippi flooded
in 1927. He dealt with the crisis (more 350,000 people were
homeless) with kindness, speed and private donations _ just how
America liked its crises addressed. The next year the Republicans
ran him for president. He won easily and settled into office. Seven
months later, the Depression hit.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to myth, Hoover did not spend the next three years
wringing his hands or ignoring the poor; he tried to combat the
Depression as best he could.
</P>
<P>
   But when his voluntarist policies failed to work, he was unable
to come up with any alternatives; he was confused, and it showed.
</P>
<P>
   And seeing this confusion, his country, by now as hungry and
broke as any he'd aided in Europe, turned on him, with marches,
rallies, death threats _ and jokes: ``Did you hear the Depression
is over?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you mean Hoover died?''
</P>
<P>
   In the next election Franklin Delano. Roosevelt _ and 25 percent
unemployment _ relegated the one-time Great Humanitarian to the
short list of truly awful presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Which is probably where he belongs: Hoover's inability to adjust
when the old ways failed did make him a terrible president.
</P>
<P>
   But he does leave behind, in addition to a string of real
(although pre-presidential) accomplishments, four intriguing
questions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Why was a man so successful at bringing food and compassion to
so many desperate people so flawed as the leader of a desperate
people?
</P>
<P>
   _ What makes the office of president different from anything
else?
</P>
<P>
   _ Can we tell, when we vote, who the next Hoover is?
</P>
<P>
   _ Or must we all simply wait for catastrophe to turn a talented
individual into the next disastrous president?
</P>

THE GLORIOUS SUMMER OF THE SOFT-SHELL CRAB 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   URBANNA, Va. _ The sun was a blood-orange disk pinned to the
horizon as Thomas Lee Walton eased his 24-foot Carolina Skiff into
the creek and headed toward the Rappahannock River. An osprey was
perched in a dead tree on the far shore. It was 6:05 a.m. We were
going crabbing.
</P>
<P>
   Our quarry was the Atlantic blue crab _ Callinectes sapidus to
marine biologists, which means ``savory beautiful swimmer'' in
Latin. But not the run-of-the-mill fellows you boil up with plenty
of Old Bay seasoning, then crack with a hammer before pulling out
the sweet, delicate white meat.
</P>
<P>
   Walton fishes for ``busters'' or ``peelers,'' which are crabs
that have already begun to shed their shells, or are about to,
before growing new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching them shed,'' Walton said with a tender reverence
suprising in a rugged outdoorsman, ``it's like they're reborn.''
</P>
<P>
   If you catch them at the right moment and pull them from the
water, the process of growth stops and you have a soft-shell crab,
one of summer's most prized treats, not only here on the rim of the
Chesapeake Bay but also, increasingly, in cities across the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   They seem to be on every menu in New York this summer, prepared
in more or less the same way: you eat the whole thing, claws, legs
and all, sauteed or grilled, maybe seasoned with a squeeze of lemon
juice. Before you try one, it sounds decidedly dubious, like tripe
or seaweed. But a single taste makes a convert.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, I served a soft-shell, grilled in my garden, to Paul
Bocuse, who formed a wildly inflated view of my cooking skills as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   Soft-shells can be deep fried, too, which makes them crunchier,
and good ol' boys like to stick them between two slices of white
bread to make sandwiches. Me, I prefer my soft-shells sauteed,
because I think the crust masks the flavor.
</P>
<P>
   All crabs molt, up to 20 times during their lives; they must do
so to grow. But the soft-shell form of the Dungeness crab on the
Pacific Coast or king crab in Alaska is seldom eaten, if ever, and
Europeans use soft-shell crabs mostly for bait.
</P>
<P>
   In this as in so many things gastronomic, the Venetians are an
exception. They consider Mediterranean shore crabs that have shed
their carapaces, which they call moleche, a great delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   Even here, where soft-shells have been savored for more than a
century, putting them on gourmands' tables is a dicey proposition,
requiring luck, hard physical labor and painstaking attention to
detail, in roughly equal proportions. Nobody has found a way yet to
farm crabs.
</P>
<P>
   Walton and his fellow watermen, as they call themselves, must
catch peelers in wire-mesh traps, take them ashore, transfer them
into shallow sea water tanks and check each one carefully every six
hours around the clock, waiting for them to shed their shells.
</P>
<P>
   The crabs, elusive and pugnacious, don't make it easy.
</P>
<P>
   In William W. Warner's fine book about crabs, ``Beautiful
Swimmers'' (Little, Brown, 1994), he quotes a splendid
triple-negative aphorism he heard from a waterman on Maryland's
Eastern Shore: ``Ain't nobody knows nothing about crabs.'' Walton
agrees, steeped though he is in crustacean legend and lore.
``Catching crabs is mostly instinct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you think you've got them figured they change on
you,'' he added, standing at the tiller of his boat, bronzed from a
summer's work. ``We try to outthink them, but they don't think.
They just react to changes in the water, little changes in
chemistry that we don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   He put in a fresh wad of Red Man chewing tobacco and squinted
into the sun, looking for the buoys that marked one of his lines of
traps.
</P>
<P>
   Walton's family has lived and worked on the water for
generations _ how many, he could not say. They moved to Urbanna
from remote Tangier Island, out in the bay, after a terrible
hurricane in 1933. They have been here ever since.
</P>
<P>
   He, his brothers, his uncle, his aunt and his son, Lee, are all
crabbers, all true Tidewater folks who pronounce ``about'' not at
all like the rest of us, but about halfway between uh-BOAT and
uh-BOOT.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Sneed is what the Walton family and their neighbors call a
come-here _ someone from somewhere else. But after almost a decade
he has won their confidence, and they have taught him most of what
they know about soft-shells, which is one reason his restaurant in
Richmond, The Frog and the Redneck, may serve the most delectable
soft-shells anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Bearded, ribald, shod day and night in one of his 14 pairs of
Lucchese boots, Sneed is (and is not) the redneck in his
restaurant's name. It comes from a moment of comic conflict more
than a decade ago, when he was working for the French chef
Jean-Louis Palladin, then the proprietor of Jean-Louis in
Washington and now installed at Palladin in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   As Sneed tells the story, Palladin was shouting at him, not for
the first time, and Sneed snapped. ``Shut up, you stupid frog,''
Sneed shouted back. Palladin whirled, glared, slammed his knife on
the counter and demanded, ``What did you call me?'' When Sneed
repeated the epithet, Palladin yelled, ``Then you must be a ... a
redneck!''
</P>
<P>
   He isn't, of course, though he sometimes relishes the role; the
son of a Veterans' Administration administrator, he grew up in a
dozen towns and cities, including Charleston, S.C., and Peekskill,
N.Y. Of course, Sneed and Palladin became close friends. And, of
course, when Sneed decided to move to Richmond after five years of
running a restaurant in Urbanna, he could not resist naming his new
place in honor of his mentor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Crab has become Sneed's metier. Every night of the year, he
serves a rich red pepper cream soup garnished with crab, as well as
ethereal crab cakes, made of prime backfin lump crab meat, bound
together with little more than a dab of mayonnaise and the chef's
prayers.
</P>
<P>
   He serves them even when crab is so scarce, as it is right now,
that he has to charge $32.50 for them to make a profit. When
soft-shells are in season hereabouts, from May until mid-October,
he serves them as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sneed buys mostly from Thomas Lee Walton, who saves the softest
of soft-shells for him. These are the ones that have been culled
from the tanks within a half-hour of molting. (The tanks are called
floats by the watermen because in the early days of the industry
they were slatted boxes floating in the creeks.)
</P>
<P>
   The new crab shells begin to form at once, and because the
watermen can't hover over the tanks, they get only a fraction of
the soft-shells at the optimum moment.
</P>
<P>
   These are called ``velvets'' in the colorful terminology of the
crabbers. Plump and bursting with salty-sweet flavor, they are also
very fragile, so Sneed, his wife or his daughter drives to Urbanna
every other day, a two-and-a-half-hour round trip, to fetch them at
the source.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soft-shells are very important to us,'' Sneed told me in a
rare outburst of understatement. ``And you have to try for the
premium raw materials, no matter how much trouble it is. Product is
king.''
</P>
<P>
   A self-described culinary minimalist, Sneed cooks the crabs in
the simplest way imaginable. He pulls them from the refrigerator,
dusts them with Wondra flour, which is milled extra fine so that it
doesn't clump, and slides them, shell side down, into a heavy
cast-iron frying pan filled to a depth of a quarter of an inch with
a 50-50 mix of canola oil and drawn butter. After 60 seconds, he
turns them and cooks them 30 seconds on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Careful,'' Sneed warned. ``When soft-shells are really fresh,
they're full of salty water, so they tend to pop and burn you.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't serve them with tartar sauce, not unless you want to
make the nonredneck see red.
</P>
<P>
   It took the watermen many years to make the discovery that put
the soft-shell trade on a sound commercial footing. Finding a
buster in a pot or along the shore is a relatively rare occurrence.
They needed some means of forecasting when other crabs were about
to molt, so they could take it ashore and wait for it to do its
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, some unstoried hero noticed that on the next-to-last
section of the articulated swimming leg, the most translucent part
of the crab, a white line that later turns pink, and finally an
intense dark red can be detected when a crab is about to shed its
shell.
</P>
<P>
   It can be detected, that is, by an experienced waterman like
Walton. I could just barely make out the line at its cherry
reddest, when the crab was an hour, maybe minutes, from molting,
but the rest of the time I couldn't break the code, no matter how
closely I looked.
</P>
<P>
   The crabs with white lines, known for some reason as ``greens,''
shed in two weeks, those with pink lines, sometimes called
``ripe,'' will molt within a week, and the red liners, termed
``rank,'' will need a day.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the telltale lines are the edges of new shells, or
exoskeletons, forming inside old ones in anticipation of molting.
</P>
<P>
   I marveled at Walton's skills. When we arrived at the traps, or
pots, that he had set out along the northern shore of the
Rappahannock estuary, he chugged up to the first, set the tiller so
it kept the boat tracing a circle around the pot and put on an
oilcloth apron and two pairs of gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with practiced grace, he snagged the buoy with a boathook
and pulled up the line attached to it, hand over hand, heaving the
pot into the boat until it broke water.
</P>
<P>
   The pot is a cube-shape contraption with three conical
entrances, which crabs can swim into but not out of. In the first
one were a half-dozen crabs, as well as a croaker and an alewife,
as menhaden are called hereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Walton undid the latch and dumped the catch onto a sorting
table, then quickly pitched the fish and the hard-shells back into
the water, closed the latch and lowered the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Only five or six times all morning did he expend more than a
passing glance in ``reading'' which crabs were peelers and which
not. Most of the time, he instantly tossed the greens into one
bushel basket at his feet, the ripes and ranks into another and the
few busters into a blue plastic basin filled with river water so
that they could continue to molt there.
</P>
<P>
   When he was unsure, he held the crab in question up to the sun,
its claws a beautiful powder blue, studied it and pitched it in the
appropriate direction.
</P>
<P>
   On picking the right crabs on such slim evidence rests his
livelihood. He makes few mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   But if the crabs aren't there, no crabber can catch them. Walton
pulled about 70 good peelers and busters from his first line of 50
traps, but from the second and third, he got only about 10, and
then he quit for the day.
</P>
<P>
   August is never the best month for soft-shells. That comes each
May, when he usually takes five or six bushels of crabs off his
boat at day's end _ about 1,000 to 2,000 crabs. The May catch is
almost as big as those of all the other months put together.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   At $1.50 each, the morning's work grossed about $120. But out of
that Walton has to pay for gas and the upkeep of his boat, his
pickup truck, his pots (which cost $12 each) and his two dozen
shedding tanks, which look like shallow plastic bathtubs. No
formula for instant riches.
</P>
<P>
   Is the overall crab catch in the bay and its tributaries
shrinking, as the harvests of striped bass and oysters did in
recent years, with disastrous economic consequences? Many watermen,
and Sneed, think it is, and they blame winter crabbing with
dredges, which pull hibernating crabs from the mud, along with laws
permitting crabbers in Virginia to keep female crabs carrying a
spongelike mass of eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Mike Osterling, the top crab expert at the Virginia
Institute of Marine Science at Gloucester Point, near Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen no records indicating a long-term decline in
soft-shells,'' he said. ``Soft-shell fishing has its good days and
bad, like anything else. But more people are going into the
soft-shell business every day, all the way from here to Texas, and
that's no sign of a fishery in decline.''
</P>
<P>
   Tradition says that the Chesapeake produces the best
soft-shells, and I'm a great respecter of food traditions. But the
season starts a little earlier and ends a little later farther
South, because of the warmer water, and I've eaten some pretty good
soft-shells taken by fisherman in Louisiana and North Carolina,
mostly small operators like the watermen on the bay.
</P>
<P>
   As for Walton, he sells all the velvets he has to Sneed, and
those with a slightly firmer shell, called ``shippers,'' he ships.
Every so often, a refrigerated truck stops here, picks up trays of
crabs covered with wet paper or eel-grass and heads north toward
the big fish market at Jessup, Md., near Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Sorted by size _ whales are the biggest, spiders the smallest,
with jumbos, primes, hotels and mediums in between _ they go to a
wholesaler named Louis Foehrkolb, whom Walton has never met. He
keeps track of the shipments and sends Walton a check at month's
end.
</P>
<P>
   I asked whether he ever worries about being shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' said Walton, whose smile is as roguish as ever at 52.
``I figure if he stops sending me money, I'll stop sending him
crabs.'' &QL;

We're looking to see if this is an aggressive counter move by the

make DSL more available to all now, or if it's still right hard to
get at any price. (Kannell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. and the federal government filed
harshly conflicting accounts Tuesday of what they believed their
76-day antitrust trial had brought to light.
</P>
<P>
   In its 776-page filing, the government branded Microsoft as a
monopolistic predator that is illegally using its dominant Windows
operating system for personal computers to engage in ``a broad
pattern of unlawful conduct.''

   ``For a long time now _ and, if Microsoft's actions to maintain
its monopoly are not halted, for well into the future _ personal
computer consumers are locked into a Microsoft world, one in which
a single company essentially controls the configuration of desktop
computing,'' argued the Justice Department, joined by 19 state
attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   In line with its original complaint and much of the trial
testimony, the government's findings focused on Microsoft's
purported efforts to dominate the market for Internet commerce by
destroying its chief enemy in the browser wars, Netscape
Communications Corp., which is now part of America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's lawyers held that the prosecutors had drilled a
dry legal hole in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the government may have scored public relations points
against the company in the initial phase of the trial using
courtroom theatrics and bits of evidence out of context, we are
entering a new phase of the case in which the government must
confront certain critically important facts that are largely or
entirely undisputed,'' the company's lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of its 465-page brief, Microsoft maintained that
should it ``fail to keep an edge in product innovation and quality
and cease to be the preference of both business and individual
consumers, its (Windows) platform business will wither and die.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the software giant said that none of the ``conduct
challenged in this case has been detrimental to consumer welfare.
Indeed, the benefit to consumers and to the nation's economy of the
widespread adoption of Windows as an industry standard has been
enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said the evidence presented at the trial proved it had
broken no now laws but merely ``responded to a competitive
marketplace by keeping prices low, integrating new features into
Windows, and constantly investing in innovation to meet the demands
of consumers and developers.''
</P>
<P>
   With these polar opposite ``findings of fact'' in hand, U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has given Microsoft and the
Justice Department one month to review each other's documents and
to file rebuttal briefs on Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Two separate sets of final oral arguments in his courtroom are
then scheduled to follow.
</P>
<P>
   The first exchange, set for on Sept. 21, will deal with the
fact-finding phase of the trial that was addressed in Tuesday's
dueling briefs. The second exchange will come after the judge
releases his own set of factual findings, but before he reaches a
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's decision to divide the current ``findings of fact''
phase from the future ``findings of law'' phase has a twin purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The first is to dampen the chances he will be reversed.
Appellate court panels have often been reluctant to reopen the
factual aspects of a non-jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   The second is to encourage the warring parties to cut a deal.
Those negotiations would presumably take place after Jackson tips
his hand with his initial fact-based ruling, thereby heading off a
final verdict that may fail to satisfy either side.
</P>
<P>
   So far, three secret sessions called to explore a compromise at
the judge's insistence have ended in failure. Settlement talks
broke off in early June and have yet to resume.
</P>
<P>
   If a deal cannot be reached and if Microsoft is found liable,
Jackson is likely to hold yet another set of hearings to determine
what remedial action should be taken.
</P>
<P>
   This potential punishment phase of the trial could range from
such relatively mild steps as barring Microsoft from entering into
exclusive licensing agreements with computer makers such as Compaq
and Dell to a Draconian order breaking up the world's most highly
valued corporation.

 &HT;    DUELING BRIEFS FILED IN MICROSOFT ANTITRUST TRIAL
 &HT;    500&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial queues.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. and the federal government filed
harshly conflicting accounts Tuesday of what they believed their
76-day antitrust trial had brought to light.
</P>
<P>
   In its 776-page filing, the government branded Microsoft as a
monopolistic predator that is illegally using its dominant Windows
operating system for personal computers to engage in ``a broad
pattern of unlawful conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time now _ and, if Microsoft's actions to maintain

`THE COLONY OF UNREQUITED DREAMS': ECHOES OF HENRY FIELDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Smallwood, who was the first Premier of Newfoundland after
it voted in 1948 to confederate with Canada, probably never
imagined that his relatively small role in world history could
become the stuff of an epic-size novel. But it has. Smallwood is
the narrator and central figure of ``The Colony of Unrequited
Dreams,'' by Wayne Johnston, a novel that transforms the forlorn
territory of Newfoundland into a fabulous terrain of tragicomic
struggle and loss.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's book falters here and there, the tragicomic
disintegrating at times into the farcical. Still, this prodigious,
eventful, character-rich book is a noteworthy achievement: a
biting, entertaining and inventive saga.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably not by accident that the second major character
in ``The Colony of Unrequited Dreams'' is named Sheilagh Fielding,
known to almost everybody simply as Fielding. She is an object of
ruined love for Smallwood as well as a kind of court jester for
Johnston. She drinks and smokes and writes highly sardonic
commentaries about Newfoundland's history and politics, a kind of
satirical accompaniment to Smallwood's own story, even as she is
the guardian of an erotic family secret that is the moral key to
Smallwood's life as suitor and politician.
</P>
<P>
   Fielding's name reminds one, of course, of Henry Fielding,
author of ``Tom Jones'' and other picaresque adventures in which a
sympathetic, common-man hero swims against the currents of adverse
fate even as the truth about his early life is concealed from him.
Smallwood is not Tom Jones. He is a short and scrawny scrambler
whose political ambition taints him and brings him into unsavory
compromises with the forces of greed and hypocrisy. And in general
``The Colony of Unrequited Dreams'' is too saturated in an
absurdist 20th-century sensibility to be seen as an 18th-century
novel.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is something about the comic extravagance of
Johnston's book, and its moral resolution, that links it tightly
with its 18th-century forebear. One senses that if Henry Fielding
had lived now, and if, like Johnston, he had been born and raised
in Newfoundland, this is the kind of story he would have written.
</P>
<P>
   The Joe Smallwood of Johnston's novel is born on Christmas Eve
1900, which makes him obviously a kind of emblem of the century.
His father is a drunken failure and a wonderfully vivid creation
who rails poetically against the surrounding unfairness.
</P>
<P>
   Smallwood is sent to Bishop Feild, the best of the private
schools in St. John's, Newfoundland's seaport capital, and it is
there that he first meets Fielding, who attends the nearby sister
school. The two of them engage in a battle of wits, a remorseless
duel to the figurative death that they will continue for the next
half-century. All the themes that Johnston will later explore in
this novel are introduced in these first two pages.
</P>
<P>
   These themes include love and betrayal but also the remorseless
contest for power that takes place in both the psychic and the
political spheres. Johnston introduces a mystery here in the form
of an anonymous letter written to the Feild headmaster, an
embittered Dickensian failure whose self-hatred turns into an
intense dislike of Smallwood.
</P>
<P>
   The letter changes everything for Smallwood and Fielding and for
those around them. It is the invisible worm that, unbeknownst to
our dramatis personae, eats away at their hearts. Meanwhile,
Fielding disappears for a time while Smallwood sets out to make his
mark on history. His itinerary from this point is what makes
Johnston's book not just picaresquely entertaining but also
powerfully dug into the drear and bitter soil of his locale.
</P>
<P>
   In one especially memorable passage, Smallwood, who had an
earlier career as a reporter, goes on a seal-hunting expedition
aboard the S.S. Newfoundland to write about the venture for his
newspaper. The chapter in which Johnston describes this experience,
which ends in tragedy, is a stunning piece of writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had been transformed by their passion on the ice,'' he
writes when Smallwood sees a group of men who have frozen to death.
``Each had assumed in death some posture emblematic of his life. Or
else they were refined to men that no one knew, as if in each face
and posture was inscrutably depicted the essence of the person they
had been.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, too, Johnston gives us the epic hardship of life in
Newfoundland, a place that seemed to be ``a landlocked country in
the middle of an otherwise empty continent, a country hemmed in and
cored by wilderness.'' It is the very desolate quality of the
landscape and the corresponding affliction of the human soul that
make ``The Colony of Unrequited Dreams'' both a powerful novel and,
in a few places, excessively silly, as if Johnston's penchant for
an extreme sort of satire goes beyond the thematic bounds he has
established.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a minor flaw as we follow Smallwood on his unlikely,
morally compromised rise to political power, a rise that is wittily
and trenchantly satirized by Fielding, who shadows his every move.
After a few poverty-stricken years in New York, Smallwood returns
to Newfoundland, where he becomes a union organizer, once walking
the entire barren length of the cross-island railway to sign up new
members.
</P>
<P>
   He enters politics as a campaign aide to a hilariously venal
prime minister, Richard Squires. But then, in the spirit of the
18th-century novel, there is moral redemption. Smallwood bravely
leads Newfoundland into confederation with Canada, which began as
an unpopular and risky cause.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he achieves a kind of absolution with regard to
Fielding when the convoluted mystery of that fateful letter of
their youths is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life for 40 years was a pair of rivers, the river that
might have been beside the one that was,'' Fielding writes in her
journal at the very end of Johnston's rowdy tale. Parallel to the
rivers of Fielding's life are the rivers of private and political
history in Smallwood's narrative and in Fielding's acidulous
counter-version. It all adds up to a brilliant and bravura literary
performance by Johnston.

 (Birth of an Opera: This is the second article in a series on the
making of ``A View From the Bridge,'' an opera adapted from Arthur
Miller's 1955 play. Lyric Opera of Chicago is to present the world
premiere on Oct. 9.)  
 (bl)  
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ When William Mason, the general director of Chicago's
Lyric Opera, visited Sidney Port last year to discuss Port's annual
substantive support of a Lyric production, he had three projects in
need of financing. Two were relatively unadventurous. But Port, an
88-year-old businessman whose own operatic taste tilts toward the
commonplace (Puccini and Verdi are his favorites), this time
departed from his usual practice.
</P>
<P>
   His $125,000 donation went to Lyric's riskiest production of the
coming season, ``A View From the Bridge,'' an adaptation of the
Arthur Miller play by composer William Bolcom and librettist Arnold
Weinstein. Commissioned in 1995 as part of the company's commitment
to enlarging the operatic canon with new American work, it is to
have its world premiere on Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Port's gift was the most unexpected element in the $1.4 million
project's financing, and it was particularly welcome because new
work generally has the same trouble finding financial supporters
that it does audiences. Unlike the production's two other major
benefactors, the National Endowment for the Arts and AT&AMP;T, which
maintain programs to support new work, Port's largess was motivated
by more idiosyncratic concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I jumped on `View' right away,'' Port recalled in a recent
interview, ``without knowing anything about it because Cathy'' _
Catherine Malfitano, who will sing Beatrice _ ``is my favorite
singer and because Arthur Miller was in on it. I go with people. I
go with the name. To tell you the truth, I really didn't get around
to reading it until last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Opera, with its grand sense of moment, with its orchestra and
chorus salaries, is the priciest of the performing arts. And opera
audiences are the most devoted to the classics. It is notoriously
difficult for new operas to gain a foothold in the canon. Indeed,
though many companies make concerted efforts to stage new works,
that's actually the easy part. What's tough is staging a second
production.
</P>
<P>
   The highest priority for Opera America, an umbrella organization
for opera companies, is Next Stage, a program that subsidizes
second productions of contemporary works. And the dead end that
confronts new operas is an obstacle to financing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a door opener, huh?'' Port said hopefully of his
gift. There isn't an arts institution in the country that wouldn't
kill for a Sid Port, a lifelong Chicagoan and loyal city booster
whose generosity is apparently unmitigated by pretension. A large
man whose heavy features and dour mien suggest a white-haired
Robert Mitchum, he's a former basketball player at the University
of Illinois who made his fortune in the machine parts business,
owns racehorses and is enough of a boxing fan that he once
sponsored a middleweight named Gorilla Jones.
</P>
<P>
   But he's also on the board of the Joffrey Ballet and the Art
Institute of Chicago, and since 1986, when he gave $40,000 to help
underwrite ``Lucia di Lammermoor,'' his support of 14 Lyric
productions has totaled nearly $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Port's latest gift (which includes contributions from the
families of his three children and is in the name of his wife,
Bettie, who died last Christmas), is all the more fortunate for its
allocation to a commissioned work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any other individual who has that kind of record
of support over the years,'' Mason said. ``Now we were going to do
`View' no matter what kind of support we got, but his faith in the
company and the art form and his willingness to support a range of
productions is crucial. Knowing you've got a Sid Port out there,
that's what you call a real blessing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As it happens, Lyric, the nation's third largest opera company
(behind the Metropolitan Opera and the San Francisco Opera), is
perhaps the leader, at least recently, in trying to enlarge the
repertory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think other companies look to Lyric as a model of how to put
on new works,'' said Wayne Brown, the director of music and opera
for the National Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also something of a model of the frustrations inherent
to the enterprise. ``A View From the Bridge'' is Lyric's third
commission in 10 years, but neither of the other two _ Bolcom's
``McTeague,'' and Anthony Davis' ``Amistad'' _ has had a second
production. And even though Lyric is among the most successful of
companies _ it has sold out its season for 11 consecutive years _
new work always calls for its most ardent marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question it's much more difficult to sell a
contemporary piece than something tried and true,'' said Susan
Mathieson, Lyric's director of marketing and communications. She
added that opera tickets were so expensive, often over $100, ``that
people want to be sure they're going to like it before they go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You do a `Tosca,' a `Carmen,''' she added, ``people have an
idea of what that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of ``View'' tickets have been helped by a season that
includes two Verdi operas (``Falstaff'' and ``Macbeth'') and
``Tristan and Isolde'' and ``Carmen.'' Full subscription sales were
strong, and if partial series subscribers wanted to see the more
popular works, they'd have to take ``View'' as part of the package.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless Bizet,'' Ms. Mathieson said, adding that the general
rule is that single tickets to a popular classic sell at four or
five times the rate for a new one. That's one reason Lyric has
scheduled 13 performances of ``Carmen'' and only nine of ``A View
from the Bridge.'' Still, some 4,000 single tickets to ``View''
will remain after all subscriptions are counted. To sell them Lyric
has just sent 750,000 brochures to people on some 50 mailing lists,
including, in hopes of capitalizing on the Arthur Miller
connection, those of several Chicago theater companies.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``By the middle to the end of August, I'll know if I have to do
something else,'' Ms. Mathieson said, adding that the ``something
else'' would probably entail a more focused mailing: say, to
periodic Lyric attendees who have shown a penchant for contemporary
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make this effort,'' she said, ``because we budget
at 100 percent,'' meaning the annual budget for the company
presumes sold-out performances. ``Nobody in the world does that,
and it wasn't my idea, I'll tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyric's budget for the 1999-2000 season _ 84 performances of
eight operas _ is about $42 million, about $30 million of which
shows up on the stage in the form of scenery, costumes and
performers' salaries. The Civic Opera House, Lyric's home, has
3,600 seats, but even with its stellar attendance figures, the
company's annual earned income is 60 to 65 percent of the total,
meaning that some $15 million to $17 million has to come from
grants, donations and endowment earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``A View From the Bridge'' will cost $1.3 million to $1.4
million, not including the salaries of the 75-member orchestra and
48-member chorus, stagehands and operating expenses of the house,
which come out of the annual operating budget. That's on the high
side for a Lyric production, even a new one, but it isn't
egregious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's roughly, on a per opera basis, what it cost to do each of
the four Ring operas,'' Ms. Mathieson said. Of the total cost,
$200,000 to $300,000 went to commissioning costs, e.g., payment for
Bolcom and Weinstein, a fee to Miller and the substantial expense
(perhaps as much as $50,000) of copying all the parts.
</P>
<P>
   Production costs _ scenery, projections (Wendall K. Harrington
is designing large-screen images of Red Hook, Brooklyn, the setting
of ``View''), wigs, costumes, props _ come to about $400,000. The
rest, about $700,000, pays salaries and expenses for the cast, the
conductor (Dennis Russell Davies), the director (Frank Galati), the
designers and the understudies.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the cost, Lyric is drawing $700,000 to $800,000 from a
$4 million fund that was established by a $1 million 3-for-1
challenge grant provided by the National Endowment for the Arts 10
years ago in support of the company's commitment to put on three
new works by the end of the century. The endowment, which devotes
about 20 percent of its grants for opera to new operas and 10
percent to new productions of recently created work, provided an
additional $100,000 specifically for ``A View From the Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, AT&AMP;T provided $150,000 through its philanthropic
arm, the AT&AMP;T Foundation, which was established in 1984 after the
dissolution of the Bell system. The foundation gives away about $50
million annually; slightly more than 10 percent of that goes to the
arts, almost all devoted to support new work in a variety of
disciplines; its annual Onstage program, which supports nonprofit
theaters, has provided money for August Wilson's ``Seven Guitars''
and Christopher Durang's ``Betty's Summer Vacation,'' among dozens
of other new plays.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the focus on new work is that in 1984 the company
was seeking to distance itself from the stodgy-old-phone-company
image that had accrued in the decades before the Bell breakup and
to create a new one that affiliates the company with high-tech
inventiveness, diversity and creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be seen as an innovative company, and so we've
tended to focus not exclusively on premieres, but certainly newer
work,'' said Suzanne Sato, vice president for arts and culture at
the AT&AMP;T Foundation. The foundation has supported all three of
Lyric's most recent commissions, and though neither ``Amistad'' nor
``McTeague'' lingered in the public consciousness, its support of
``View'' was never a question. ``For us in the region, it was
exactly a no-brainer,'' said Ray O'Connell, the corporation's
public relations vice president for the Midwest. ``Most of what the
foundation supports out here we recommend, and this was something
we recommended almost instantaneously.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which casts Port's gift, a very personal one, in some
relief. ``What I do, giving away money, is no big deal,'' he said.
He grew up poor in Chicago in a ``third-rate hotel'' run by his
parents, who still found time for charity work. He started his
machine parts company, Lawson Products, in 1952 with a loan of
$30,000 from his father-in-law. The company went public in 1970,
and the stock has split seven times since then.
</P>
<P>
   He's not particularly a fan of new opera; he did see
``McTeague'' but didn't remember much about it, including the
composer's name, or realize the same man had written ``View.'' His
interest, he said, was in supporting the institutions of the city
where has lived his whole life, in perpetuating a tradition of
cultural philanthropy (which is why he asked his children to join
him in this gift) and in honoring an art form he was introduced to
by his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that an opera might not live beyond its debut
production seemed new to him but not too troubling. He had an
analogy, unusual for the opera world but not for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds me,'' he said, ``of something Charlie Whittingham
used to say. You know who he is? A great horse trainer I was in
business with. Charlie used to say, `You never know if a horse is
any good until 10 years after it's dead.'''

URBANWORLD FESTIVAL NAMES FILM WINNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Drylongso,'' a drama directed by Cauleen Smith, was
awarded the grand jury prize for best feature on Sunday at the
third annual Urbanworld Film Festival in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, which focuses on films with themes drawn from
minority groups, announced its winners after presenting 62 movies
over five days at the Cineplex Odeon Worldwide Plaza Cinemas.
Nearly 10,000 people attended the screenings, said Stacy Spikes,
the festival's founder and executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith's film, which takes its title from an African-American
term that means ``ordinary,'' ``getting by with very little'' or
``just the same old thing,'' tells the story of an adolescent
photographer's quest to document what she considers an endangered
species: young black men. Armed with a Polaroid camera and charming
savvy, the heroine, Pica, sets out on her mission and encounters a
series of eccentric neighborhood characters who force her to
recognize the value of her own life.
</P>
<P>
   While attending San Francisco State University, Ms. Smith
received attention for her short films ``Daily Rains'' (1991) and
``Chronicles of a Lying Spirit by Kelly Garbon'' (1992).
``Drylongso'' is her first feature.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Williams was named best director for his feature,
``Spark,'' which he described as ``a suspenseful drama about a
young black couple driving across the country from Chicago to Los
Angeles, stranded in a small desert town and pulled into a somewhat
violent web.''
</P>
<P>
   The award is ``very exciting, but what it means for my career
has yet to be determined,'' Williams said. ``Spark'' originated as
a short shown at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival, the New
Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art and at the
USA Film Festival in Dallas, where it won the Grand Prize. The film
in its expanded version was selected to participate in the 1997
Sundance Filmmaker's Lab.
</P>
<P>
   The prize for best short went to Rod Gailes' ``Twin Cousins,''
about a spirited girl who concocts an ingenious plan to avoid a
summer trip with an unkind aunt. Honorable mention in the category
went to Jim Fleigner's ``From the Top of the Key,'' the story of a
teenage prodigy struggling with his abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Nanette Burstein and Brett Morgan won for best documentary with
``On the Ropes,'' an inside look at the world of boxing, set in the
Brooklyn gym that produced the heavyweight Riddick Bowe. ``Innocent
Until Proven Guilty,'' Kirsten Johnson's examination of the
statistic that one in three black men between the ages of 16 and 35
is under the supervision of the criminal justice system, was
awarded an honorable mention.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Invited Guest,'' directed by Timothy Wayne Folsome, won the
audience award for best feature. In it, a dinner party turns
violent when a seductive escaped convict spends the evening with an
unsuspecting couple, only to fall in love with the wife.
</P>
<P>
   Each winner received $1,000 worth of film stock donated by the
Eastman Kodak Company. The winner for best short also received $500
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   In a screenwriting competition, Tanya Hamilton won best
screenplay with ``Stringbean and Marcus,'' a coming-of-age tale
about two children in a family of former Black Panthers. The prize
included $500 from Bourgeoisie Films, the production company of the
actor Samuel L. Jackson and his wife, LaTanya Richardson Jackson,
who are both on the festival's board. Michael Genet received
honorable mention for ``Pork Pie,'' the story of a jazz competition
sponsored by the Devil's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Citing her ``outstanding body of work as an actress,'' the jury
presented a special award to Nicole Ari Parker. Ms. Parker was a
frequent presence on the screen during the festival, appearing in
the commercial feature ``Blue Streak'' with Martin Lawrence as well
as three competing films, ``Mute Love,'' ``Loving Jezebel'' and
``Spark,'' which received premieres at the festival.

 &HT;    GUN EXPULSIONS DROP IN U.S. SCHOOLS
 &HT;    520&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite a well-publicized spate of school
shootings, the number of students expelled for bringing a gun to a
public school dropped nationally in the 1997-98 school year, the
U.S. Education Department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Expulsions for gun possession dropped by as much as 31 percent,
although inaccurate or incomplete data submitted by some states
made precision impossible. As many as 5,700 students in 1996-97 and
roughly 3,900 in 1997-98 were expelled for bringing a firearm to
school.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent gun-related expulsions, 61 percent involved a
handgun, 7 percent a rifle or shotgun, and the remaining 32 percent
another type of firearm or explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sharp decline in the number of students bringing guns to
school tells us that we are starting to move in the right
direction,'' said Education Secretary Richard Riley.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Gun Free Schools Act requires states that want
federal aid for their schools to adopt and enforce laws that
require an automatic one-year expulsion of a student who brings a
gun to school.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed that about 57 percent of the expelled children
received no alternative education during their expulsion, a policy
that the Clinton administration has proposed to outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   The report also showed that the one-year expulsion was shortened
on a case-by-case basis for 44 percent of those expelled. About
one-third of those whose expulsions were shortened had learning,
emotional or physical disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials agree that the decline in expulsions
was due to fewer violations, rather than laxer enforcement by
schools, according to Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder.
</P>
<P>
   He said the drop was consistent with reports by the Department
of Justice of a decline in gun-related violent crimes for all ages
in all locations, and by the Centers for Disease Control of a
decline in ``violence-related behavior'' by young people.
</P>
<P>
   Holder said the trend was boosted by consistent enforcement of
strict rules and by tighter gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason, according to school-district security officials
who joined Riley for the announcement, is that more children think
they might be caught. The officials said adults and students alike
are more likely to report gun-toting students than they were before
the mass shootings in Pearl, Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Jonesboro,
Ark.; Edinboro, Pa., and Springfield, Ore., and this year in
Littleton, Colo., and Conyers, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community, they're our eyes and ears, and we can rely on
them,'' said Lt. Karen Hall of the Atlanta public schools.
``They'll report anything from a burglary in progress to students
being disruptive or being where they're not supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Schools remain the safest place for children, with fewer than
one out of 100 murders of children taking place in or around
schools. But many educators either share or feel they must respond
to public concerns that crescendoed after a teacher and 14 students
died at Columbine High School in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a still a lot of school districts that don't know
what they are doing,'' acknowledged Jack Martin, chief of police
for the Indianapolis public schools. But this summer, even small
districts that felt most distant from urban violence have been
trying to find out which ``best practices'' are affordable, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Schools are trying everything from hand-held metal detectors and
closed-circuit TV cameras to policies that require transparent
bookbags or forbid clothing baggy enough to conceal weapons, the
security chiefs said.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by parents, communities and law enforcement to identify
and assist ``red-flag children'' before they commit dangerous acts
will do far more to make other children safe, said Edward Ray,
director of security for the Denver public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone wants to see our schools transformed into
institutions with concrete walls surrounded by concertina wire,''
Ray said.

SIFTING A CULTURAL HERO'S LIFE TO DEFINE PUERTO RICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The singer Hector Lavoe came to New York from Puerto
Rico as a teen-ager in the late 1960s and became a cultural figure,
his high pure-as-air voice riding salsa's drums. Then he dissolved
in a stew of drugs and hard living.
</P>
<P>
   Lavoe died in 1993, and now his life, his musical excellence and
his death at 46 are being mined for meaning and money. ``Quien Mato
a Hector Lavoe?'' (``Who Killed Hector Lavoe?''), which is playing
at the 47th Street Theater through the end of the month, is in one
sense a conventional musical, linking some of his songs with
dramatic interludes that explain his personality.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also an attempt by Puerto Rican intellectuals to
figure out and reassess the image of a cultural hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puerto Ricans don't have a Jesse Jackson to speak for us,''
said David Maldonado, the producer who conceived the play. ``We're
constantly looking for leaders, for people who show us who we are,
people who have achieved something. We need our property, our
place, and Hector gave that to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Maldonado, who started in the Latin music industry as Lavoe's
roadie, spent years sifting his experiences to find the material
for a play. He turned the writing over to Pablo Cabrera, a teacher,
and brought in the biggest Latin music agents in the United States,
Cardenas/Fernandez &AMP; Associates, as executive producers. They
financed the show, putting up nearly half a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing a show about Hector makes a lot of sense because he has
so many aspects that make him legendary,'' Maldonado said. ``He
died young, which puts him in the category of Malcolm X, JFK and
Marilyn. He was the most gifted singer of his generation, the bad
boy of salsa but a humane guy, like a pacifist. He was the people's
singer, a champion like Muhammad Ali. And he was a hick, coming
from Ponce, Puerto Rico, to Gotham with this incredible gift. Even
though he had tragedies every day in his life, he'd get up on stage
and be the Bruce Lee of our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The musical is one of the highest-grossing Off Off Broadway
shows, but for Cardenas/Fernandez, the smallness of the theater
limits the profit; it can only break even. Still, the company has
invested in something that can go on the road internationally for
years, and there are plans for it to spend four or five months in
Puerto Rico, then go to Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in Colombia,'' said Henry Cardenas, the president of
Cardenas/Fernandez, ``and Lavoe was part of our musical experience.
This play has huge potential.''
</P>
<P>
   For the company, the play is part of a larger plan to promote
more Latin theater. So Cardenas/Fernandez is working on a
large-scale musical called ``Salsa, Mambo, Cha-Cha-Cha,'' based on
the glory days of such music in the 1940s and '50s in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, Claudio Segovia, the creator of ``Black and Blue'' and
``Tango Argentino,'' is working on an Afro-Cuban musical, and the
Tropicana Review from Havana is being offered for a United States
tour. Latin musicians like the pianist Eddie Palmieri have been
approached to work on musicals.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas said, ``I think `The Capeman' started people thinking
about the possibilities of the Latin musical, given all the music
from all over Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quien Mato a Hector Lavoe'' is a nostalgic work that explores
an extraordinary era in American popular culture, the period of the
late 1960s and '70s. For Caribbean Latinos, the period is often
called Fania Era, after the record label, which recorded their best
musicians, including Lavoe, Willie Colon, Johnny Pacheco, Larry
Harlow and Ismael Miranda. It was in essence a renaissance of
Afro-Latin cultural production.
</P>
<P>
   Pacheco, the show's musical director, was one of the founders of
Fania Records, a great band leader of the time and a producer and
talent scout for the label.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really strange to go back to that era for the play,
putting together all the songs that we had done together,'' said
Pacheco, adding that he had met Lavoe in 1968 when he asked to sing
with Pacheco's band. ``But his story is so sad, finally, because of
his inability to stay clean, to stay off of drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Domingo Quinones, the Puerto Rican singer who plays Lavoe, has
had a few small film roles and a part in a recent production of
``Jesus Christ Superstar.'' The actor studied Lavoe, and his
stillness, his eyes hidden behind brown aviator glasses, evokes
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Domingo scared me,'' said Pacheco. ``He sounds just like
Hector when he wants to, and he has his calm down perfectly, the
way Hector moved his hands. It's really incredible what Domingo's
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinones is one of the reasons the story is reaching its
audience. Indeed, at a recent sold-out show, members of the
audience were so involved they warned Lavoe not to take the drugs
offered to him. Even some of the cast members were surprised at the
reaction to Quinones' eerie realism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I underestimated Lavoe's importance until this
project,'' said Claudette Sierra, who plays Lavoe's sister in the
play. ``The people that are his fans are amazingly passionate about
him. Nobody leaves the theater without having a visceral reaction,
in part because Domingo is so good. Even though Hector's behavior
wasn't particularly good, he stayed humble, he never became a diva,
and people respect that. He had an erratic, confused life, a life
that is so much fodder for drama, but in a down home way. He's like
a Latin Bruce Springsteen, homeboy who makes good but remains true
to his roots. And that he destroys himself is the tragedy.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients for heavy thunderstorms to erupt over the upper
Midwest late Wednesday night and early Thursday will begin to come
together. A warm front marking the leading edge of humid air from
the Gulf of Mexico will press north across the Plains Wednesday as
its escort jet stream disturbance emerges from the Rockies. Showers
and thunderstorms, some with heavy rain, will develop over parts of
the northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley. In the wake of
the disturbance, a trough of low pressure will be left from the
western Dakotas to northwest Texas.
</P>
<P>
   With the trough acting as fertile breeding grounds, a
low-pressure system will rapidly develop over the central Plains
around dawn Thursday as a potent jet stream disturbance emerges
from the Rockies. As the rapidly developing low lifts humid Gulf
air in waiting near the surface, clusters of heavy showers and
thunderstorms will flare across the upper Midwest from the northern
Plains across the upper Mississippi Valley to the western Great
Lakes. Some of these storms will produce severe weather, with
tornadoes and hail possible, but the greatest threat will be heavy
rains and flash flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Broken areas of generally light rain will accompany a warm front
across southern and central New England. Farther south, potent
thunderstorms will erupt near the Carolina Coast. Though most
storms will stay over the ocean, a few may develop inland, raising
the risk of severe weather.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hot weather will persist over the interior Gulf
states.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Dark Days
</P>
<P>
   As daytime darkness descends along a narrow corridor from
northwestern Europe to central Asia during Wednesday's total solar
eclipse, the primary meteorological effect will be a temporary
temperature drop that will average about 5 degrees Fahrenheit.
Evening birds will begin to sing. Frogs will break into a husky
nocturnal croaking. Solar eclipses are one obvious cause of the
eerie tales of dark days sprinkled throughout history. Other cases
of extreme darkness during the day are often the result of volcanic
eruptions or soot from distant forest fires that almost totally
block the sun.

TV NOTES: NEW GAME SHOW WITH PHILBIN; TEENS ON VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Game Show Wins Regis
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Regis Philbin, who when he enthuses, enthuses from
every pore, is hardly able to contain himself about his forthcoming
project for ABC, a prime-time game show called ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told David Letterman the other night that I am going to be
the savior of the ABC network. I am going to resurrect ABC!''
Philbin said. ``This show totally knocks me out.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, which Philbin will be host of beginning Monday night
at 8:30, certainly promises to be something either very new or very
old. It will certainly be the first game show to be broadcast in
prime time every night (except one) for two straight weeks. But it
is also very consciously aiming to be a throwback to the early days
of television, when the big-money quiz show was a formula for hit
television.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Davies, the executive producer, called the show ``the
perfect 1990s rendering of 1950s television.'' For those who
instantly associate those '50s game shows with Charles Van Doren
and rigged answers, he added, ``And the format does not have to be
fixed for it to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The format, which involves a series of tryouts by contestants,
first by phone and then in the studio, eventually results in a
single player's answering a series of multiple-choice questions
worth ascending amounts of money, all the way up to $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   It was created by an independent production company in Britain,
Celador, and the format has spread to more than 50 countries. In
almost all it is a huge success.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, where the show has been broadcast less than a year,
it is a certified phenomenon. Davies noted that in its last
two-week burst the show hit a new high when it reached 72 percent
of the potential audience in a single night.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin said he heard about the show, saw the British version
and was so excited he campaigned to win the host job. ``I just knew
I wanted to be part of this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, which had success last summer with another British format,
``Whose Line Is It Anyway?'' with Drew Carey, which has gone on to
become a weekly entry in ABC's fall lineup, decided to take a
chance on the game show, even though its schedule was totally
unconventional.
</P>
<P>
   It calls for ABC to clear a spot for ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire?'' every night beginning Monday (except for the
following Monday, Aug. 23, when the network previously had
committed to a football game). The show will even expand to a full
hour on the two Sunday nights of the run.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the hope is that the show will become enough of a
success for ABC to bring it back on numerous occasions for further
tournaments. ``Of course we want to keep it going if it's a
success,'' Philbin said. Davies noted that the show was so flexible
it could be scheduled in a number of different ways, from once a
week to seven times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Davies said, ``I honestly think it is flat-out the best format
I've ever seen in television.'' He backed that up with his job,
quitting his post as ABC's vice president for programming to become
the show's executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   What is different about the format is the application process,
which requires would-be contestants to phone a 900 number and take
part in a quick quiz, then move to a second level which involves a
live phone playoff with other daily winners. Finally 10 contestants
are flown to New York, where they engage in an on-camera
all-or-nothing shootout with one question. The winner then plays
the game.
</P>
<P>
   That also has several new angles. The questions are all multiple
choice, and they come in ascending difficulty. The money grows
slowly from $100 to $200 to $300 to $500. Then it starts to double.
If someone somehow got 15 answers right they could win the $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other wrinkles. The contestant can quit at certain
levels and keep the money. If, for instance, a contestant gets to
$16,000 and misses, he would fall back to the $1,000 level. If he
gets to $32,000, he gets to keep that amount if he misses at
another level.
</P>
<P>
   But at say, $125,000, the incentive to quit gets much stronger.
A miss drops the contestant back to $32,000.
</P>
<P>
   The other wrinkle is that the contestant can get help only three
times and in three different ways. He can ask the audience to vote
(and Philbin said that in Britain the audience majority is almost
always right), he can ask for two wrong answers to be eliminated,
leaving a 50-50 chance, or, in the show's most novel innovation, he
can call a friend he thinks might know the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin noted that no one in England has come close to the $1
million prize so far, always quitting for fear of losing a big
payoff, a potential drawback that Davies believes will be reversed
in the United States by the greater willingness of Americans to go
for broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's great about the show is that it takes knowledge and
courage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The show is a virtual tracing of the British version in style,
Philbin said, and that includes all kinds of lighting effects and
music to heighten the drama. It will be taped at the Sony Music
Theater in Manhattan, another overt homage, Davies said. ``The
1950s shows were from New York,'' he said. ``That's where we want
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers on Violence
</P>
<P>
   In the flood of television news magazine stories about
teen-agers and violence that followed the shootings at Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colo., most of the voices came from
parents and childhood experts.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Neal Shapiro, the executive producer of ``Dateline
NBC'' concluded, and he set out to see if there was a way to get
the voices of teen-agers themselves heard.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a special one-hour ``Dateline'' on Wednesday night
at 8 devoted entirely to examining what teen-agers have to say
about issues like parental control and guns in schools.
``Dateline'' made an arrangement with Teen People magazine, using
its publication base of what it calls trend spotters to assemble a
forum of teen-agers who could be brought to New York as a special
focus group.

   Shapiro then enlisted Katie Couric to interview them after they
viewed several reports the show compiled. ``I came away most
surprised about how many teens said they wanted parents to be
parents and not their friends,'' Shapiro said. ``They wanted rules
and limits. They said they would rebel against them but they want
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that several teen-agers were ``very frank about how
painful high school can be.'' And on the question of how easy it
would be to acquire a gun, ``they all said it would be very easy,''
Shapiro said.

OFF THE COB, USE YOUR IMAGINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JACK BISHOP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's only so much you can do with a whole ear of corn. How
many flavored butters can one cook devise?
</P>
<P>
   But take the kernels off the cobs, and the possibilities expand
exponentially. Chowders, salsas, salads, griddlecakes, breads,
muffins and savory custards can all begin with fresh corn off the
cob.
</P>
<P>
   True, kernels cut loose don't have quite the glamour of a whole
ear steamed and dripping butter or charred from the grill. And cans
and freezers haven't helped matters: just the thought of those
mushy, flavorless pellets is enough to stop a cook's creativity
cold.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time of year when daily indulgence may be making corn
on the cob taste a little dull, a few knife strokes can open up new
possibilities for making more of the American symbol of summer. The
cooked kernels can even be turned into creamed corn to make a side
dish worlds away from the canned kind.
</P>
<P>
   Whole kernels sliced off the cob _ cooked or raw _ work best in
most dishes, but for baking, grated raw corn has better texture.
The whole ears can be run over the coarse holes on a four-sided
grater to produce a thick and juicy puree that can be added to
batters for griddlecakes, muffins or corn bread.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite summer side dish in my house is savory corn
griddlecakes flavored with Parmesan and chives. They take just 10
minutes to make; the batter is nothing more than grated corn
enriched with an egg and a little flour and then ladled into a hot
skillet. The cooked cakes are golden brown on the outside, creamy
on the inside and full of fresh corn flavor. I serve them with
grilled steak, since they absorb the meat's juices wonderfully, or
tucked under a grilled salmon fillet.
</P>
<P>
   To a novice cook, cutting the kernels off a long, pointed ear of
corn may seem daunting. But there is an easy and safe technique:
snap the ears in the middle to break them in half, then stand each
piece up on its flat end, so it stays steady. Then slide a sharp
chef's knife down the length of the cob on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   With most recipes, the cobs can be tossed into the trash or onto
the compost heap. But they can actually be used to make a quick
corn broth for soup or chowder or to enhance the corn flavor in
dishes with rice. Cover them with cold water in a pot, and simmer
20 minutes to extract the remaining juices from the cobs.
</P>
<P>
   Cooked kernels are even more versatile than raw, especially for
salads. Grill the corn when you want a sweeter, caramelized flavor
that can stand up to strongly flavored ingredients like chilies.
Boil the ears when you want pure corn flavor.
</P>
<P>
   I like to combine boiled corn with diced roasted red peppers,
parsley, olive oil and lemon juice to make a quick relish for fish
or chicken. Lightly caramelized grilled corn makes a classic summer
salad with tomatoes, basil, red onion, olive oil and red wine
vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   Grilled or boiled corn can also be turned into chunky salsas.
Corn works especially well with soft, juicy fruits like mangoes or
peaches as well as with chilies and fresh herbs. It can also be
used in a salsa with black beans, tomatoes, lime juice, cilantro,
chilies and a little minced garlic or shallot.
</P>
<P>
   Some people like to eat corn raw, but I prefer to cook it, on or
off the cob. A quick dunk in boiling water _ no more than a minute
or two _ makes corn off the cob much more tender.
</P>
<P>
   Raw corn kernels can also go right into the cooking pot with
almost any green vegetable. I throw some corn into a pan of
simmering green beans just before the beans are tender and let them
both cook another minute or so before draining the pot and tossing
the vegetables with an herb vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   A cup or two of raw corn kernels and a handful of minced fresh
herbs make an excellent last-minute addition to a pot of steamed
white rice or soft polenta. The heat from the grains will soften
the corn in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to saute corn off the cob. I stir raw corn
kernels into a pan of sauteed wild mushrooms, add a splash or two
of stock, water or cream and cook it just until the corn is tender,
no more than five minutes. You could omit the liquid, but sauteed
corn can be a little tough. The liquid also keeps it from
scorching.
</P>
<P>
   For a creamier, richer dish, I braise kernels in a covered pan
filled with a cup or so of stock or water for every four cups of
corn. The steam coaxes out starch from the corn, which helps to
thicken the liquid into a silky sauce. A little butter can be
swirled in at the end, or a few tablespoons of cream can be added
and simmered until the liquid thickens.
</P>
<P>
   When boiling or grilling corn, I often intentionally cook too
many ears. After dinner, I cut off the kernels and refrigerate them
in airtight containers. (You could keep the corn on the cob; it may
stay a tad juicier. But in most cases, you will be moistening the
kernels anyway, and I would rather just get rid of the cobs.)
</P>
<P>
   Cutting off the cooked kernels is also an ideal solution for
leftovers. An uneaten ear of corn can't be reheated, and is likely
to be left moldering in the refrigerator. But it's hard to resist a
bowlful of kernels, cleaned and ready for anything from muffins to
quesadillas.

 &HT;    WebMD plans major ad blitz
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ WebMD Inc. plans to launch a big-ticket, high-stakes
advertising campaign aimed at imprinting the company's name on the
consciousness of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   With brand name considered critical to success on the Internet,
Atlanta-based WebMD _ a company which thus far has only minuscule
revenues and no profits _ plans to spend upwards of $200 million
during the next five years on the campaign, according to Reggie
Bradford, the company's chief marketing officer.
</P>
<P>
   The spending estimates include distribution agreements with the
likes of CNN and Lycos, as well as advertising, research and direct
mail.
</P>
<P>
   To carry out the plan, WebMD has switched advertising agencies,
jumping to Ogilvy &AMP; Mather WorldWide. Building a brand name will be
the core of the campaign, said Shelly Lazarus, Ogilvy &AMP; Mather
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``WebMD is strategically positioned to become one of the
Internet's most powerful brands,'' she said. ``All communications
will be created to bring to life WebMD's vision of improving the
quality of health care for all its constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   WebMD's former agency was New York-based Gotham, which also
represents ETrade and Maybelline. That agency was responsible for
the start of the campaign, including the somewhat offbeat
television ad that conjures the movie ``Thelma and Louise'' _
albeit with two cars and a happy ending. The ad shows patients and
doctors leaping between cars that have bolted off a cliff. The cars
land on the other side of a huge canyon as the passengers smile.
</P>
<P>
   But WebMD has big ambitions, and Gotham was a bit too
``boutique.'' By contrast, Ogilvy is much larger, with offices in
100 countries.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD said the campaign will capitalize on its arrangements with
Excite, Lycos and the Microsoft Network to be the exclusive
provider of health care information. The company also has a deal
with CNN in which reports about health are delivered 32 times a day
under the WebMD logo.
</P>
<P>
   The company faces a near-frenzy of competition for the
potentially huge market in the Internet health care sector. Among
rivals are local companies like adam.com, as well as national
players like OnHealth, DrKoop, Medscape and WebDoctor.
</P>
<P>
   But in the year since its public coming-out, WebMD has soared to
prominence _ if not profits.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans in September to merge with California-based
Healtheon, with the combined company to be headquartered in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   However, the value of the deal has plunged since its
announcement in the spring, when Healtheon stock crested at $105 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   By last week, it had fallen to $41. On Tuesday, the shares
closed at $31.50, down $7.43 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

   AVIGNON-FESTIVAL (Avignon, France) _ The Avignon Festival is the
largest theater festival in France. In its 53rd season this year,
from July 9 to 31, it presented more than 50 works of theater and
dance in 23 spaces in and around the city, from an old quarry eight
miles out of town to the traditional open-air stage of the Cour
d'Honneur in the Papal Palace. While French-language theater still
accounts for more than half of the program, this year's festival
included a special focus on South America, as well as works from
Bulgaria, Italy and Germany. By Anne Midgette.

limits and beyond. For anyone brought up on the movies of the 1940s
and 1950s, those of the early '30s can be a revelation. Sinners
escape punishment and virtue is not necessarily rewarded. Crime
sometimes pays and marriage vows are frequently flouted.

   ACID-HOUSE-FILM (Undated) _ ``The Acid House,'' which opened on
Aug. 6, is a triptych of three short films by the Scottish writer
Irvine Welsh. The language is coarse, with salty Scottish slang and
accompanying subtitles. The humor is dark, and, certainly in the
first two shorts, there's a fuller, albeit gloomier, sense of
working-class Edinburgh. Of the three shorts, the first, ``The
Granton Star Cause,'' about a hapless young man who loses his home,
girlfriend and job before being transformed into a fly by God, and
the third, ``The Acid House,'' a hallucinatory tale of a man who
switches identities with an infant, are closer to the movie
``Trainspotting'' in their use of Kafkaesque visuals. By David
Bahr.

entering its third summer. Pure Pop's organizers promise to match
the Fringe quirk for quirk, with programming that includes a rarely
seen temperance play (``10 Nights in a Barroom'' by William Pratt),
an 18th-century Japanese epic (``The Battles of Coxinga'' by
Monzaemon Chikamatsu) and several shows with titles not suitable
for a family newspaper. All in all, Pure Pop promises to stage 60
productions over seven weeks through Oct. 3. By Jesse McKinley.

her opinion, that do not evoke dance's ``variety and texture'' (two
of her favorite words). This summer, the first season she has

his wife, Diane Paulus, is an adaptation of Shakespeare's

sublime standard for generations of landscape photographers. The

Dorothy Dandridge was a movie star who rivaled Marilyn Monroe and
Ava Gardner. But Dandridge's film career sputtered, and she fell
victim to personal demons, tragedy and, perhaps most of all,
bigotry. The first black woman ever nominated for an Academy Award
as best actress died penniless _ but still beautiful _ at the age
of 42 in 1965. It's still unclear whether Dandridge took her own

U.S. EDUCATION SECRETARY SAYS VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS LESS LIKELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As schools reopen for the new academic year, U.S.
Education Secretary Richard Riley offered this reassurance Tuesday:
Parents and students should not fear repeats of deadly gun rampages
such as the one last April in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said school efforts to counter violence are paying off and
students are getting the message that guns have no place in school.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a new Education Department report showing that a total
of 3,390 students were expelled for bringing firearms to school
during the 1997-1998 school year, the most recent year available.
The number was 31 percent lower than the previous school year, when
5,724 students were expelled.
</P>
<P>
   The ``sharp decline ... tells us that we are starting to move in
the right direction,'' Riley said. ``All of us _ parents,
educators, students and all citizens _ can look to this new school
year with hope, not with fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Modzeleski, director of the department's safe and drug-free
schools program, said statistics for the 1998-1999 school year just
completed are not yet available because of a lag time in reporting
from local school districts and state education agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Less than one percent of all homicides among school-age children
occur in or around schools, Riley said. Nevertheless, surveys have
shown a level of anxiety among parents and students over school
violence.
</P>
<P>
   One such survey of high-school age students released Tuesday by
the Horatio Alger Association showed 37 percent feel safe in
school, down from 44 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   But local school security officials meeting with Riley said they
believed schools generally are safe places, and that incidents such
as the one at Columbine High School are ``an aberration,'' as
Wesley Mitchell, police chief of the Los Angeles Unified School
District, put it.
</P>
<P>
   In that incident last April, two students stormed into Columbine
and killed a dozen classmates and a teacher before committing
suicide. Other similar incidents have occurred in Pearl, Miss.,
West Paducah, Ky., Jonesboro, Ark., Edinboro, Pa., and Springfield,
Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that while educators and law enforcement
officials have taken measures to pinpoint potential troublemakers
and prevent violence from occurring, guarding against a future
random attack is extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the point of attack, very few of the measures we could
have, or do have, in place probably would have prevented the
Columbine incident,'' said Edward Ray, director of security for
Denver public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we identify those young people ... `red flag' students
that seem to be heading in (a violent) direction. It's a very
complex issue. It's not something that can be readily identified at
the school level.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said that incidents such as Columbine are ``beyond
predictability,'' adding: ``Our number one goal is to make our
schools as safe as we possibly can without turning them into
bunkers. I don't think any of us in this country want to see our
schools become institutions surrounded by concrete walls and
concertina wire.''
</P>
<P>
   The education department report released Tuesday showed:
</P>
<P>
   _ The majority of those expelled in the 1997-98 school year _ 62
percent _ were expelled for handguns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seven percent were for possession of rifles or shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   _ The remaining 31 percent were for other types of weapons such
as bombs or grenades.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fifty-seven percent of those expelled were high school
students, while 33 percent were in junior high school and 10
percent in elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, larger states reported higher numbers of
expulsions. California, with a school-age population of 6.2
million, had 382 expulsions. New York, with 3.2 million school-age
children, had 91 expulsions. Texas, with 3.9 million children,
expelled 424 _ the highest state total.
</P>
<P>
   The expulsions are the result of the 1994 Gun-Free Schools Act,
which conditioned federal education dollars on states passing laws
that require local school districts to expel. All states have
adopted such laws.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, Riley said, the Education Department
will release $135 million in grants to help schools and communities
prevent violence through drug and alcohol counseling, and programs
to help young people find ways of resolving problems without
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Marquis, chief of police at the Houston Independent School
District, said authorities have gotten smarter about making it
harder for youths to carry guns in school. Among the anti-gun
measures are controls on backpacks and a dress code that makes it
difficult for students to hide guns in clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primarily, however, information (on students with guns) comes
from other students,'' Marquis said. ``These are all signs ... So
when we say the numbers are down, we have good indicators.''
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Riley spoke at a press conference here just hours before a
gunman opened fire in a Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles,
wounding five persons including three children. While that incident
did not conform to the pattern of students taking out their
frustrations with guns aimed at fellow students, it raised new
concerns about levels of random violence and the ability of
authorities to guard against unpredictable outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   Riley referred to the particularly gruesome round of
blood-letting in Atlanta last month in which securities day-trader
Mark O. Barton killed 12 people including his wife and two children
before committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta episode and the wave of school shootings serve to
remind ``once again that this country really has created a culture
of violence with this easy access to guns,'' Riley said.
``Americans really need to stop and think hard about what's
happening.''

 &HT;    BellSouth announces fee cut to attract customers
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth said Tuesday it would cut the cost of its
Fast Access high-speed ADSL Internet and data services for
customers who sign up between Aug. 8 and Sept. 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The move is part of BellSouth's strategy to find a price point
that will attract customers and accelerate the use of high speed
access technology throughout the nine-state BellSouth region. ADSL
competes against other high speed data services offered by cable
television companies and others.
</P>
<P>
   During the enrollment period, BellSouth will waive its $199.95
installation fee for customers who meet the requirements for the
high speed service. Subscribers will still pay a $99.95 activation
fee, followed by a monthly charges that will remain remain at
$59.95. BellSouth's Complete Choice calling plan customers will pay
$50.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth executives won't say if the $199 installation fee will
be reinstated after Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Cunha, vice president of broadband services, said: ``We
are actively looking at ways to make this affordable. Now and over
the long term, we are serious about making Fast Access affordable
for all of our 15 million customers. Cuhna says lowering
installation prices is one way to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single BellSouth subscriber is able to enjoy this
rate,'' says Terry Yarbrough, senior director of product marketing.
``When we come out of this program, we will have a pricing
structure in place people will find attractive,'' he says. ``This
is just the point we are starting at.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth hopes to have five million digital subscriber line
customers before the end of the year across the nine-state region.
Even though not every area in metro-Atlanta is capable of receiving
ADSL service, Yarbrough says that newly-developed technology will
help make the service accessible to more and more BellSouth
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to send a strong message to our customers that we are
committed to providing this service,'' Cunha says. ``Our goal over
time is to make this service accessible to as many people as
possible and to make installing ADSL as easy as plugging in a
toaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers can order FastAccess service by calling 1-888-321-ADSL
or visiting the BellSouth.net's Web site:

STUDY LINKS ANDREW JACKSON'S POOR HEALTH TO LEAD POISONING FROM
BULLET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Tenn.)   (bl)  
 By ABBIE ZUGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andrew Jackson survived the War of 1812 and many campaigns
against American Indians only to be felled by his own physicians _
at least, that is what many historians have long believed. The
seventh president's doctors, they argued, subjected him to decades
of ill health, and may even have hastened his death, by overdosing
him with the mercury-containing medications of his time.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists analyzing long-treasured snippets of Jackson's
hair now have come up with evidence that gets his doctors off the
hook. Their findings, they report in Wednesday's issue of the
Journal of the American Medical Association, suggest instead that
the former president's chronic health problems were partly caused
by lead poisoning from a bullet that lodged in his left shoulder in
1813 and stayed there for almost 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of two samples of Jackson's hair, clipped in 1815 and
1839, wrote Dr. Ludwig Deppisch, professor of pathology at the
Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine and lead author
of the study, failed to show toxic levels of mercury, despite
Jackson's heavy use of calomel, a mercury-containing medication he
took for constipation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calomel was the aspirin of the early 19th century,'' Deppisch
said. ``People took it for everything.'' But in Jackson's case, he
said, ``It wasn't the mercury that killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor were the mercury levels in Jackson's hair high enough to
account for many of the symptoms _ including severe mood swings,
irritability, paranoia and eventual kidney failure _that plagued
Jackson for the last 30 years of his life and often have been
ascribed to chronic mercury poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Deppisch's team did find high lead levels, however, in the
sample of Jackson's hair clipped in 1815, when Jackson was 48,
thirteen years before he was elected president. The hair was
clipped as a memento for one of the general's admirers, and
obtained from a collection of similar snippets now housed at the
Hermitage, Jackson's Tennessee home. The home is now a museum and
research archive.
</P>
<P>
   Two years earlier, in 1813, a lead bullet had shattered
Jackson's left shoulder, and he began complaining of severe
abdominal cramps and constipation around that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can explain many of Jackson's intestinal problems on the
basis of lead colic,'' Deppisch said. Lead colic is a symptom of
lead poisoning and takes the form of excruciating intermittent
abdominal pains. The mercury-based calomel Jackson took in heavy
doses may have exacerbated his intestinal problems, Deppisch said.
It may also have caused the premature loss of Jackson's teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Two separate lead tests on a lock of Jackson's hair from 1815
contained lead levels of 105 and 156 parts per million
respectively, the scientists found. ``If you match out the hair
levels to blood lead levels, that would come out to about 20
micrograms per deciliter,'' said David Gemmel, director of research
at Forum Health hospital in Youngstown, Ohio, who collaborated with
Deppisch on this project. Symptoms of lead poisoning may be seen
when blood lead levels reach this level, Gemmel said, but the
present-day treatment for that stage of lead poisoning would
consist of removing the source of lead, close observation and
frequent testing. Medication for lead poisoning, called chelation
therapy, would not be offered until blood lead levels were
substantially higher, Gemmel said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Rosen, a professor of pediatrics at Montefiore Medical
Center in New York and an expert on lead poisoning, who was not
involved with the study, said, ``Hair lead levels are difficult to
interpret because of analytic concerns,'' and it is impossible to
reliably correlate blood and hair lead levels. Still, he said,
Jackson's history and symptoms are very consistent with adult lead
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jackson lived to be 78, by his early 50s his health had
deteriorated so profoundly that ``there wasn't a day of his life
that he wasn't uncomfortable,'' said Dr. Robert Remini, an emeritus
professor of history at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who
is the author of many books about Jackson, including a three-volume
biography.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man was in constant pain throughout his administration,''
Remini said. Jackson served as president for two terms, from 1829
to 1837. During the last six months of his administration, in the
winter of 1836-1837, he was so ill that he conducted matters of
state from his bed and only left his bedroom twice, Remini said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that although the lead bullet that destroyed Jackson's
shoulder was surgically removed in 1832, at the midpoint of his
White House years, the operation occasioned only a transient
improvement in Jackson's health. In Deppisch's study, a sample of
Jackson's hair clipped in 1839, seven years after the bullet was
removed, showed that the lead had decreased substantially, to safe,
though still slightly elevated, levels.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, however, Jackson was suffering from swelling of
the legs and abdomen caused by the kidney and heart failure that
eventually killed him in 1845.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always important to know more about the physical and
mental conditions of our presidents,'' Remini said. ``Andrew
Jackson could be very angry. His treatment of the Indians
sometimes, I think, reflected his own physical pain and discomfort.
That's my guess.''

IT'S TOUGH PUTTING A NAME ON THOSE OLD FEELINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Memories should not be done in misty watercolors. I like my
memories vivid and distinct, with all the sights, smells and sounds
of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The images of my past are like an art museum in my mind. There
are great works displayed on the canvas of my soul. Some of my
recollections are like landscapes, pastoral scenes of peaceful
days. Others are like muddled blotches of paint splashed on a
painter's coveralls. A visit to this growing gallery is ofttimes
exhilarating, sometimes humiliating, but always interesting.
</P>
<P>
   When relationships end, when circumstances change, our memories
are so frequently all we have left. That is what terrifies me about
Alzheimer's and other diseases that rob you of your past. If I
don't have that reservoir of painful lessons learned and
hard-fought victories to guide me, how do I determine my latitude
and longitude?
</P>
<P>
   I was having this conversation, or rather a conversation like
this one, with my husband recently. Well, I guess it was a
conversation. He nodded while I talked. Technically, that's a
discussion for women like me. Anyway, as we were exchanging
thoughts, I recalled a wonderful moment in our past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey,'' I asked. ``Do you remember that time we went to
Galveston?''
</P>
<P>
   His eyes lit up in recognition and he smiled a mysterious, manly
smile, just like he did in Galveston many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A manly smile is the kind where the guy just kind of turns up
the corner of his lips and leans his head slightly to the side. The
eyes twinkle under the heavy lids, and that quarter-inch of hair on
his face folds into the creases that line his mouth like
parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   You know, that is just amazing, the way hair grows out of men's
chins. I love that! A guy shaves in the morning, leaves for work,
and comes home a few hours later with hair on his face. My husband
says that I should be over this fascination after 14 years of
marriage, but I still love it when he grows that facial hair for
me. It is for me, you know.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I said, ``Wasn't it beautiful that evening? You had a
blanket and that picnic basket filled with fruit, that expensive
kind of cheese, and chocolate-covered strawberries. The sunset was
like a rainbow that God rolled into a ball and tossed onto the
ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   My honey bunny closed his eyes and reveled in the memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You even brought along your jam box and all those Luther
Vandross tapes,'' I continued. ``You know how I love Luther.''
</P>
<P>
   Then I closed my eyes and let the memory wash over me like a
sudden downpour in the middle of the family reunion picnic, just
when you were finally beating Cousin Willie at dominoes for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   When I opened my eyes, my husband was staring at me and
frowning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong?'' I asked. ``Don't you remember all the fun we
had that evening?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you forget that night? That was one of the best
times we've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember because that wasn't me with you that night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' was all I said.
</P>
<P>
   Then I remembered that the chin hair that night was on a
different chin.

<P>
   At that point, I was torn between conflicting advice coming from
my left brain and my right brain. Do I argue with him and swear
that it was him and that he's forgotten? Do I laugh and say that I
made it up just to tease him? Or do I say that I was with my
favorite really old uncle that evening who was trying to cheer me
up because I'd been diagnosed with a rare disorder that makes me
remember things that never happened?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I just said: ``How does lasagna sound for dinner?
That's your favorite, and I haven't cooked it in a while. In fact,
you just let me know whenever you want lasagna, and I'll whip it
right up for you. Just any old time, uh huh, you bet.''
</P>
<P>
   Looks like I won't be touching honey bunny's wonderful chin
hairs for quite some time. Oh well, I'll always have my memories.

RUNNING DOWN THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANITA VERSCHOTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASLAV, Czech Republic _ In the summer of 1983, in the span of
20 days, Jarmila Kratochvilova of Czechoslovakia lowered the world
record in the 800 meters and the 400 meters and won two gold medals
and one silver at the first world track and field championships in
Helsinki, Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Her extraordinary performances, however, were shrouded in
controversy. Was she really that good, some critics wondered, or
were her amazing times _ 1 minute 53.28 seconds in the 800 and
47.99 in the 400 _ achieved with the help of drugs?
</P>
<P>
   And in perhaps the unkindest cut of all, was she really a woman?
</P>
<P>
   Kratochvilova, then 32 years old, was heavily muscular, with a
stocky frame and a preference for wearing drab warm-up suits. She
never flunked a gender test or a drug test in an era when there was
no out-of-competition testing.
</P>
<P>
   Kratochvilova was aware of the innuendos swirling around her
then, yet today she prefers to remember those days as the happiest
in her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought that I would like to look like other women,
with more in front and a better-looking backside,'' the 48-year-old
Kratochvilova said recently. ``I have an athletic body. I was not
hurt when I heard those remarks. My body has been good to me; it
has kept me healthy. As for drugs, I never 4took any. Never.''
</P>
<P>
   She returns to the world championships Aug. 20-29 in Seville,
Spain, this time as a coach of two female Czech athletes. Anyone
who has not seen Kratochvilova in recent years may be startled by
another transformation: gone are about 18 pounds of muscle.
</P>
<P>
   She is now slender, with her hair fashionably cut and her face
tanned and finely chiseled. Her blue eyes light up when she laughs,
a welcome shift from the shy, often surly ``state professional''
who seldom felt comfortable in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   She earned only 8,000 crowns ($235) for an 800-meter mark that
is the oldest surviving among major events in the sport, for men or
women. No woman has run faster than 1:54.44 in 10 years, and no one
has broken 1:55 this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an athlete, I never made $15,000 in my life,''
Kratochvilova said in an interview in this medieval town 50 miles
east of Prague, where she commutes eight miles four times a day
from her home village of Golcuv Jenikov for coaching sessions.
``When I hear today that some runners get $15,000 for a 1:58, I
prefer to keep my mouth shut. That's not sports anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Kratochvilova said today's runners spend too much time traveling
the world for several meets a week and too little time on
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My generation ran in two big championships per year; the rest
of the time it was all concentrated work,'' she said. ``I would not
have minded to get some money for all the work I did.''
</P>
<P>
   And work she did. Her coach, Miroslav Kvac, said that
Kratochvilova's success was the result of intense workouts, not
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Although other Soviet-bloc athletes, most notably in East
Germany, were subjected to sophisticated state-supported sports
programs that included the use of anabolic steroids and other drugs
during training, Kvac said, ``there were never any drugs involved''
in Kratochvilova's regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just supplements such as vitamins, amino acids, protein,''
said the 67-year-old Kvac, who still coaches at the Caslav
Athletics Club.
</P>
<P>
   Initially a sprinter, Kratochvilova went unnoticed until Kvac
shifted her to longer distances. But at 5 feet 7 inches and 152
pounds, she was at first handicapped in the 400 and 800 by her
weight and short body. So Kvac decided to turn her weight into
power, working with hundreds of pounds of weights at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Kvac put her on a program that included take-off jumping and
uphill sprints. She ran 200-meter sprints 20 times, and on a
steeper hill, 60-meter sprints 12 to 16 times. Kratochvilova, who
won a silver medal in the 400 at the 1980 Moscow Olympics, still
remembers the punishing 300-meter interval drills _ 20 of them _ at
a 47-second pace, which she executed with only a two-minute rest
between each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps you cannot imagine what it means to run 300 meters 20
times,'' she said. ``You should try it. Every day of my training
was hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ladislav Krnac, a Slovak journalist, who followed
Kratochvilova's career, said recently, ``She was willing to torture
herself.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There are very few of those around. She didn't need
orders. She knew, `If I suffer, I can get good.'''
</P>
<P>
   American athletes and fans seldom saw Kratochvilova compete. In
January 1984, she made the first of four appearances in the United
States, competing in the Sunkist indoor meet at Los Angeles.
American coaches and officials were stunned at her muscularity, and
one prominent chiropractor, Dr. Leroy Perry, said at the time, ``I
think there is something chemically different about her
physiological makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet-led boycott of the Los Angeles Olympics cost
Kratochvilova an almost certain Olympic gold medal in the 800. An
Achilles' tendon injury put her out of competition a year later,
and she resumed training for the 1987 world championships in Rome,
but finished fifth in 1:57.71.
</P>
<P>
   Kratochvilova now lives with her parents in a spacious two-story
house that was built six years ago. The parents occupy the lower
floor while she has the second floor to herself. Most of her
trophies are on display in her large living room.
</P>
<P>
   From a drawer she pulls out a plastic shopping bag that contains
her medals from international championships. They are in the bag,
she said, because they often have to be taken to schools for
children to look at and perhaps draw inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the apartment are neatly stacked toys awaiting the
next visit of 2-year-old Steppana, the first grandchild of her
sister Maria. There was never time to marry as an athlete,
Kratochvilova said; her sisters' five children, plus her runners
are her family.
</P>
<P>
   Since she began coaching, she has been paid a salary as a high
school physical education teacher, although she coaches mainly
graduates. She also gives clinics in Prague and Bratislava,
Slovakia. Her group is sponsored by Adidas and some local
industries. Her celebrity status is written on the car door of the
silver Skoda she drives.
</P>
<P>
   At the world championships, Kratochvilova's star pupil, Lyudmila
Formanova will be one of the medal favorites in the 800. At the
world indoor championships last March, the 25-year-old Formanova
outran Maria Mutola en route to a winning time of 1:56.90.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there wouldn't be any good results without hard work,''
Formanova said after a recent workout. ``But Jarmila introduced me
to it gradually. There are days when I don't feel like training,
but she teaches me not to give in.''
</P>
<P>
   Kratochvilova recalled: `When I won a race and stood on the
podium, I felt great satisfaction. It was a feeling that is hard to
describe. You feel you have triumphed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often tell my two girls that I hope they too can experience
this satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Hana Benesova, a sprinter, is the other athlete Kratochvilova
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Does Formanova believe she can run a time under 1:54?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, never,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kratochvilova smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't think you could run 1:56 either,'' she said.

VH1 MOVIE BRINGS WOODSTOCK BAND BACK TOGETHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The year is 1967: The Age of Aquarius is in full
swing. A funky, photogenic, multiracial band forms in L.A. At a
coffeehouse gig, a beautiful 17-year-old from Glendale, Nansi
Nevins, gets up from the audience and starts singing with the band.
She joins the group and becomes the band's star.
</P>
<P>
   They give free concerts in the park and begin to attract a
following. They open for such legendary acts as the Doors and the
Grateful Dead; they're the first band to play at Woodstock in 1969.
Then, just as they're breaking into the national spotlight on
television shows, including ``The Red Skelton Hour'' and ``American
Bandstand,'' tragedy strikes: Nevins is nearly killed in a car
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, miraculously, she recovers, but one of her vocal cords
has been badly damaged by the tracheotomy that saved her life. The
band soon disappears into the netherworld of ``whatever happened to
...'' trivia questions.
</P>
<P>
   If Sweetwater had never existed, someone would have had to make
up a movie about them _ create a bittersweet tale like ``The
Commitments'' or ``Still Crazy'' about a fictional band, on the
verge of superstardom, that loses it all. But they did exist. Now,
they're back together again, performing, laying plans for a new
album and as the subject of the TV movie ``Sweetwater: A True Rock
Story,'' which debuts Sunday on VH1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really fun. Who could have imagined this?'' said
songwriter/keyboardist Alex Del Zoppo, who has reunited with Nevins
and bassist Fred Herrera. ``We don't even have a press agent. But
you turn on MTV these days, and it's like the all-Sweetwater
channel. It's almost embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweetwater may not have a publicist, but MTV Networks does. This
is the first original movie produced by VH1, sister channel to MTV,
and they are, in fact, promoting the heck out of it. Frequent
messages pop up on-screen reminding you that ``Sweetwater'' is just
days away; ads on the channel link the band to virtually every
significant event of the '60s. Nevins is played by ``Felicity's''
Amy Jo Johnson in her youth and by singer/actress Michelle Phillips
in the present day.
</P>
<P>
   The band's path back from obscurity actually began about four
years ago. Del Zoppo and Herrera had stayed in touch over the years
but had lost contact with the others. One is still around but has
moved on and declined to rejoin the band. Three died, either in
accidents or, in flutist Albert Moore's case, of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Nevins was the missing piece of the puzzle. After her accident,
she'd had a rough time finding her place in the world. After a
long, painful recovery, which left her voice much-changed from the
early days, she recorded a solo album. It bombed.
</P>
<P>
   After that, ``I crashed and burned personally. ... I was
homeless for a period of time,'' Nevins recalls. She abused drugs
and quickly ran through any money she'd made as part of Sweetwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally,'' Nevins said, `` I needed money, so I went back to
school. I figured that was the way to make more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevins earned a teaching credential and went to work at
California State University, Fullerton. ``I like teaching people in
the same place I was in a few years ago,'' she explains about her
love of teaching young college students. The talkative Nevins had
by now shed the stage name Nansi, and reverted to spelling her
first name Nancy (same pronunciation ... hey, she was a teen-age
girl in the '60s).
</P>
<P>
   Though Nevins had taken a new path in life, she admits, ``This
thing would not die inside of me. I always felt like (Sweetwater)
had unfinished business.''
</P>
<P>
   So when she saw a newspaper article about the 25th anniversary
of Woodstock that said Sweetwater was ``missing,'' she felt
compelled to respond. ``(START ITALS)I'm(END ITALS) not missing,''
she wrote, signing her name and city to the letter that ran in the
paper a week later.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Herrera tracked her down. ``We got together in a
coffee shop and talked for four hours,'' Nevins recalls. Soon, the
two got together with Del Zoppo and started doing some informal
jamming for the first time in more than two decades. Around the
same time, Nevins started writing the story of the band and her own
journey in longhand during school breaks in the faculty lounge.
These notes would eventually turn into the basis for the VH1 movie.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera had stayed in the music business, both as a backup
musician and an orchestra manager for such artists as Yanni. He
admits he was surprised and delighted to hear that Nancy's voice
had come back well. ``It's not the same voice,'' Nevins admits,
``but it's strong.'' Actually, her voice, which in her younger days
was compared to the big voice of Grace Slick, today has a slightly
raspy quality that recalls a more willowy Kim Carnes (``Bette Davis
Eyes'').
</P>
<P>
   Del Zoppo had sort of a love-hate affair with music. He made a
living for several years as a session musician with such stars as
the Beach Boys and Eric Burdon but grew tired of the lifestyle. ``I
got kind of burnt out on the business,'' Del Zoppo admits, ``So I
started a construction business. I just kind of wanted to work and
collect a check for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Zoppo was the most hesitant of the three to regroup as a
performing act. ``We'd had all this great hope for our band. We'd
just about made it,'' Del Zoppo says, ``then the bottom fell out
from under us. It really kind of leaves a bitter taste in your
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was won over by the chance to write music and perform
again. Also, Nancy's enthusiasm was contagious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nancy is the eternal optimist, and it's paid off for her,''
Herrera says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any dream needs to be pursued,'' says Nevins, who seems to
have achieved a sense of peace after years of hardship. ``I think,
as Winston Churchill said, `Never give up.' Everything brought me
to this moment. I believe in synchronicity, in perfect timing in
the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevins now lives a quiet life in Tujunga, tending to her garden
and her cats. She's taking a break from teaching writing and
literature at Glendale Community College to concentrate on music.
</P>
<P>
   The band now has high hopes for the future. After years of being
out of print, their music is set to hit stores again: Rhino, the
reissue label owned by Warner Bros., is releasing ``Cycles: The
Reprise Collection'' on Monday, the day after the VH1 movie airs.
They're working on a new album, though they don't have a label yet
and are fielding offers to tour based on the publicity for the
movie. Del Zoppo says they've been offered a tour of the House of
Blues chain, for example.
</P>
<P>
   For now, all three are just trying to enjoy the ride _ and get
used to being seen by young people as icons of another era.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're young, you really don't know the implications of
what's going on,'' Herrera says. ``We didn't really appreciate how
rare it was that we made it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Zoppo says he had a moment of realization in a conversation
with Kurt Max Runte, who plays him as a young man. ``He called to
ask me some questions,'' Del Zoppo recalls, ``and at the end of the
conversation, he said, `I'm looking forward to this. I've never
played a historical figure before.' I said, `What?' Then I
realized, I guess he's right,'' Del Zoppo says with a laugh. ``We
ARE historical now.'' &QL;

<P>
   HOUSTON _ More than 52 years after baseball legend Jackie
Robinson cracked the pro sports color line, minorities have barely
penetrated the top ranks of the industry, National League president
Leonard Coleman told blacks meeting Tuesday in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, 2 percent of the jobs in the front office were
held by African-Americans and other minorities. Today, that number
is 21 percent. That's not insignificant progress,'' Coleman said on
a panel at the National Urban League's annual conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we made enough progress? The answer is an emphatic,
`No.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, said Coleman, only Bob Watson, formerly with
the Houston Astros and New York Yankees, had managed to ascend to
the highly visible post of general manager. Seven other minorities
have risen to the rank of assistant general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old boy network has outlived its usefulness, but it's
still entrenched,'' said Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig also was scheduled
to appear on the panel discussing sports as a pathway to power but
canceled, citing scheduling conflicts. Coleman, however, said a
recent meeting with Selig and other ``disturbed'' industry leaders
had yielded some action.``
</P>
<P>
   ``The commissioner has issued a letter to all clubs stating that
no clubs may hire a general manager, an assistant general manager,
a field manager, a head of player development or a head of scouting
without first consulting with the commissioner,'' Coleman said in
the panel at the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minority candidates must be considered. Can it be done? I
would argue yes, obviously with the backing of the commissioner.''
</P>
<P>
   From the National Football League side of the panel, Michael
Huyghue, a senior vice president for football operations with the
Jacksonville Jaguars, said that while 70 percent of the players are
black, none of the 31 team owners are and only two of the investors
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find myself in National Football League meetings each year
as the only African-Americans in those boardrooms, which is
striking and unfortunate,`` Huyghue said. ``We shouldn't be at a
stage where someone 37 years old is the only voice of
representation for African-Americans in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Huyghue said NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue was sensitive to
the problem but added that was far from enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until owners in the NFL are African-Americans, I don't believe
we'll truly have the full inclusion and level playing field that we
all seek,'' Huyghue said. ``The commissioner has been behind it,
but the commissioner is an employee of the owners of the NFL so his
edicts, while important, don't carry the weight that ownership must
take on.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond ownership and front-office posts, Coleman said the
vending, supply, construction and professional service side of the
sports industry provided another path for minority inroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in Houston, there was a referendum,'' Coleman said of the
vote to build the new ballpark on the east edge of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to get the support of the minority community, 30
percent of the construction contracts and jobs were set aside for
the minority firms,'' Coleman said. ``A new ballpark generates $119
million to $187 million in total spending per year and, also each
year, 2,000 to 3,200 full- and part-time positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Huyghue said he is confident the time will come when he will
look around NFL board meetings and not be the only ``dark face'' he
sees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a few years ago, it would have been unthinkable that
Green Bay, Wis. , a team that has a long history in the NFL, can
have a black head coach, a black offensive coordinator and a black
defensive coordinator and a white quarterback who is known as one
of the top quarterbacks in the game,'' said Huyghue, who was
referring to Green Bay Packers' quarterback Brett Favre, a two-time
NFL Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happens now without much notoriety.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The meeting concludes Wednesday. A morning town meeting on ``The
Police and People of Color: Can't We All Just Get Along?'' features
12 nationally recognized panelists.
</P>
<P>
   The moderator is Charles J. Ogletree Jr., a Harvard Law School
professor. Panelists include attorney Johnny Cochran, Karen K.
Narasaki, executive director of the National Asian Pacific American
Legal consortium; John F. Timoney, police commissioner of
Philadelphia; and Raul Yzaguirre, president of the National Council
of La Raza. &QL;

 &HT;    GOP HIGHLIGHTS PENSION PROVISIONS IN TAX BILL
 &HT;    By SCOTT MONTGOMERY
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans opened a broad public relations
campaign supporting their $792 billion tax cut bill Tuesday with a
news conference touting the plan's bipartisan measures to expand
retirement savings.
</P>
<P>
   Opening a sales campaign that will occupy much of the August
recess, Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said provisions such as raising
401(k) contribution limits address the need to encourage greater
savings among Americans.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert , R-Ill., will be
in suburban Chicago hammering away at the same theme in a speech to
workers at an auto parts plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll (also) have a bigger-picture message,'' said Hastert's
spokesman, Pete Jeffries, of ``challenging the president to sign
tax relief into law.''
</P>
<P>
   The underlying point of the Republican effort is to buttress the
tax bill against an anticipated veto by President Clinton, who
favors a smaller tax cut package. The GOP plans to have members of
Congress appear on radio and television talk shows and do
interactive online chats ``frankly, to explain what's in the
bill,'' Portman said.
</P>
<P>
   This week's focus is on retirement savings, next week's will be
about tax cuts and the economy as a whole, and in the final week of
August the GOP plans to focus on how their program benefits
families, women and children.
</P>
<P>
   But every week will be about going up against Clinton, who calls
the GOP plan ``risky'' and ``irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just ask the question,'' Portman said, ``how
irresponsible is it to expand savings plans for people who don't
have retirement programs?''
</P>
<P>
   Among the provisions in the pension reform section:
</P>
<P>
   _ Increasing annual limits on pre-tax contributions to pension
programs such as 401(k) plans from $10,000 to $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increasing tax-deductible IRA contributions from $2,000 to
$5,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   _ Permitting workers over 50 to have higher contribution limits
that would allow them to ``catch up'' for years when either income
or expenses from child rearing didn't allow them to make regular
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Faster vesting that allows workers to become eligible for
matching contributions from their employers in three years rather
than five years.
</P>
<P>
   Portman is co-author of the pension reforms in the bill, which
were offered in stand-alone legislation earlier this year. His
partner, Rep. Ben Cardin, D-Md., helped draw an array of
co-sponsors from across the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the support of both labor unions and the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce for improving the advantages of tax-deferred
retirement accounts, that seems unlikely to draw opponents of the
larger tax-cut bill into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   Cardin himself said Tuesday that while he was thrilled to see
both the House and Senate pass a bill carrying the pension reforms
he and Portman put together, he still disagrees with the bill
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting that (Republicans) are highlight the pension
provisions, because they're such a small part of this big tax
bill,'' Cardin said. ``I'm one of those people who would encourage
the president to veto the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   But Portman and Cardin agree that even if the existing tax bill
is vetoed as expected, the retirement savings element is likely to
be transplanted into a compromise bill simply because it has drawn
so much support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's extremely likely that if we have any significant
tax bill, we'll have pension reform,'' Cardin said.

 &HT;    Reno to convention: Funding the court system will help
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno on Tuesday called for
increased funding for the nation's court systems to combat juvenile
crime, domestic violence and child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in my heart and soul that if we give the judges the
tools to do the job, they will do it,'' Reno said in a brief
address to the American Bar Association's annual meeting here.
``Let's give our courts and our judges what it takes to do
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's comments to the ABA's House of Delegates almost coincided
with the airing of an NBC ``Today'' show interview with Independent
Counsel Ken Starr, who declined to comment on repeated questions as
to whether he believes Reno has conducted herself properly during
his five-year investigation of President Clinton and his wife,
Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Starr said the ``career people at the Justice
Department are honorable, decent people'' and that the independent
counsel's office has had a good relationship with them during the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked whether he could say the same thing about Reno,
Starr answered, ``I'm not going to comment.'' When told he was
leaving the impression that he does not believe Reno has been
honorable and decent throughout the investigation, Starr again
replied, ``I'm simply not going to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   During her speech before the ABA, Reno noted that the nation's
drug courts recently celebrated their 10th anniversary and that
there are now 359 in operation across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The country should draw upon the drug court success and use it
to combat domestic violence and child abuse and neglect, the
attorney general said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us use that experience and show what can be done and let
courts lead the way,'' she said. ``But we can't if we make justice
a hollow, hollow voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno also noted that, over the next five years, more than 2.5
million inmates will be released from prison and returned to
society.
</P>
<P>
   Unless something is done about it, ``they will come back to
their apartments near the open-air drug markets and they'll have no
job,'' Reno said. ``Guess what? They're going to be (committing
crime) again.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno called for the initiation of ``re-entry courts'' that give
the criminal justice system the chance to monitor inmates returning
to society. ``Unless we bring them a chance of success, the
criminal justice system will fail again,'' said Reno, who provided
no specifics about this new brand of court system.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also noted that 16 percent of the inmates in the prison
population have been diagnosed with mental illness. These prisoners
are neglected and need help, she said, calling on the nation's
lawyers to speak up for them and help these inmates as they
continuously return to prisons and jails.Bill Rankin writes for the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Atlanta, Ga.

PAT ROBERTSON'S DEADLY FOREIGN POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Marianne Means' column will resume on Thursday, Aug. 19)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Christian Coalition President Pat Robertson, the
preacher and former Republican presidential candidate, recently
urged President Clinton to end the decades-old U.S. policy that
forbids the assassination of foreign leaders we don't like.
</P>
<P>
   Premeditated murder across borders in an exercise of national
revenge is, in Robertson's eyes, a good family value. He assumes
that global moral order is automatically on our side, the end
justifies the means and there will be no destructive consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Good grief. This is not God's plan, it is Machiavelli's.
</P>
<P>
   The political world is a breeding ground for bizarre notions.
But coming from a famous evangelist who is accustomed to giving the
Republican Party fits, a revival of this bloody, unethical and
impractical theory of governing by covert force is exceptionally
alarming.
</P>
<P>
   What is he trying to do? We all know that Robertson's belief in
the gospel is conditioned by his frustrated political ambitions.
Yet surely pronouncements from a theological pulpit should be held
to decent limits.
</P>
<P>
   His 1988 presidential run was disastrous; he fizzled in the
first primary in New Hampshire and never recovered, even in his
Southern home base. He has tried to pick presidents by intimidating
candidates with his bellicose, self-righteous Christian Coalition.
But nowadays his crumbling organization is less influential than in
past elections. He has even sold off his television network.
</P>
<P>
   So Robertson has become something of a political leftover, vying
with fresher conservative voices for attention. Killing off
America's perceived enemies is a familiar Robertson theme. He has
long advocated secret counterterrorism squads to assassinate
kidnappers and killers of Americans abroad.
</P>
<P>
   He raised the subject again this week on his religion-oriented
television program the ``700 Club,'' specifically suggesting we
``send a squad in to take out somebody like (accused terrorist)
Osama bin Laden, or take out the head of North Korea ... take out
(Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic, take out (Iraqi President
Saddam) Hussein. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, he left his much-advertised Biblical principles behind
the studio door when he decided to discuss foreign policy. Unless
the Good Book has been rewritten lately, the Ten Commandments still
insist that we are to love our neighbors, not to kill them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's (assassination) the intelligent thing to
do,'' Robertson said. ``I don't see anything unchristian about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson is not bothered by the traditional moral, legal,
practical and operational objections that have long barred
government-issued orders to gun down some leader in another
sovereign country. He has also predicted the end of the world in
his lifetime, maybe in 2000, so perhaps he doesn't care what our
national standards are in the brief meantime.
</P>
<P>
   The official American policy toward assassination was publicly
settled in the 1960s during President Lyndon Johnson's
administration after a Senate investigation of CIA activities that
exposed inept plots to kill Cuban President Fidel Castro. Johnson
himself once told me he believed Castro's agents encouraged Lee
Harvey Oswald to kill President John F. Kennedy in retaliation for
the CIA plots.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson executive order making it illegal to conspire on
behalf of the U.S. government to assassinate anyone has been the
official policy of subsequent administrations.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of practical reasons for this, in addition to
the fact that state-ordered killing is morally wrong without
judicial due process.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious is self-preservation. If we set out to kill
another country's political leaders, the targeted group is apt to
try to kill our leaders too. Murdering a controversial foreign
official could also lead to a brutal round of atrocities in which
innocent people of that country would needlessly die.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot authorize a cycle of international murder-for-hire.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, it doesn't work anyway. Those who replace the
victims may be even worse. We cannot control foreign succession.
</P>
<P>
   And if we are after terrorists, the odds are the campaign will
fail.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorists are cunning about hiding and resilient as well. After
the attack on Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics, Israel
methodically assassinated 11 suspected leaders of Palestinian
terrorist organizations over the next two years. Palestinian
terrorist attacks continued.
</P>
<P>
   Our foreign policy is conducted by diplomacy, not by the end of
a gun or the tip of a poison dart. When it is necessary to wage
war, we will do so. But in the meantime we will be wise not to
tempt the fates with evil deeds masquerading as acceptable public
policy.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Russian forces continued to do battle with Islamic
militants in the mountains of the North Caucasus, Vladimir Putin,
the newly designated prime minister, said Tuesday that he had
proposed a ``package of measures'' to bring the volatile situation
under control.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from a morning meeting with President Boris Yeltsin,
who Monday anointed him as the Kremlin candidate in presidential
elections next year, Putin, the former head of Russia's domestic
intelligence service, said he hoped that these measures would quell
the Islamic fundamentalist insurrection within weeks. He did not
say what the measures were.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Islamic militants set off the crisis by crossing
the Chechen border into the neighboring Russian province of
Dagestan and seizing several mountain villages. Tuesday they issued
a statement declaring Dagestan's independence as an Islamic state,
and vowing to drive away ``infidels'' from its territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Dagestani authorities, who recently called in the Russian
army to help them fend off the threat of armed Islamic militants,
dismissed the statement as propaganda, and said it had no support
from the local population.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation in the North Caucasus promises to be the top
issue facing Putin, as he tries to prove to Yeltsin, and the
country, that he has the leadership qualities he needs to make a
serious run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real test of his ability will be the Caucasus,'' said
Andrei Piontkovsky, head of the Center for Strategic Studies in
Moscow. ``There is no clear-cut strategy now, and it will be
necessary to take very difficult decisions. In the end, it is not a
military problem, but a political problem, the same one every
Muslim state faces with its fundamentalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Unrest and lawlessness in the North Caucasus have been one of
Moscow's major security concerns since the 1994-1996 war in
Chechnya, which ended with the defeat of Russia's undisciplined and
demoralized federal forces.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Chechnya has in effect seceded from Russia, although
its independence has not been formally recognized.
</P>
<P>
   In Dagestan on Tuesday, Russian troops from both the army and
the Interior Ministry continued their attacks on the rebel
strongholds in the southwestern part of the province. Most
civilians had evacuated the villages Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the remote region were sketchy, and at times
contradictory. According to some reports, militants have been
forced out of some villages, but it is not clear where they went.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, Lt. Col. Anatoly Kornukov,
commander of the Russian air force, said that three air regiments
were involved in the campaign, and that so far, 78 reconnaissance
and attack sorties had been flown.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Kornukov said the militants have sustained heavy losses
from the air strikes, and that some have retreated, but he gave no
specifics. In the first day of fighting, a Russian airplane
accidentally struck a police station near one of the rebel bases,
killing several Dagestani policemen.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Dagestani interior minister, a Russian air
force officer was killed Monday in a mortar attack, four soldiers
were wounded and two military helicopters were burned.
</P>
<P>
   Kornukov denied charges made Monday by the government of nearby
Georgia that Russian airplanes had bombed a Georgian village.
Kornukov said Russian planes had not violated Georgian air space,
but suggested that bombs dropped along the commandoes' escape route
might have been carried overland into Georgia as a provocation.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts Tuesday, attempting to make sense of Yeltsin's
sudden decision to dump his last prime minister, Sergei Stepashin,
concluded that the president had found Putin to be a tougher, more
resolute leader.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Monday by Yeltsin how his mood was as he took over his new
job, Putin _ who began his career as a KGB officer _ answered
curtly: ``combative.'' Putin's nomination goes to the Parliament's
lower house next Monday, where he is expected to be confirmed by
deputies eager to concentrate on their reelection campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Federal Security Service, and secretary of the
Kremlin's advisory Security Council, Putin was already deeply
involved in Moscow's campaign in the Caucasus, and it is still not
clear whether his plan of action, presented Tuesday, will differ
from the course taken by the Stepashin government.
</P>
<P>
   In his parting comments to the Cabinet on Monday, Stepashin, who
returned Sunday night from a trip to Dagestan to oversee the
operation, said the coordination between the various forces,
including army and Interior Ministry troops, was poor. ''I had to
fly there and say that I was taking the responsibility myself,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to news reports, the Islamic commandoes _ adherents of
the so-called Wattabi fundamentalist sect which has been gaining
strength across Russia's northern caucasian region _ are led by
Shamil Basayev, a field commander who became a Chechen hero during
the war with Russia, and by Hattab, a shadowy Jordanian-born
guerrilla fighter who has established a military training camp in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Wattabi sect has already made inroads into Dagestan, a
region made of 33 different, mainly Muslim, ethnic groups, but in
other villages, their presence has been tolerated by authorities.
Even if Russia's latest military operations succeeded in pushing
out the latest wave of militants, the problem of rising Islamic
militancy _ fueled by poverty and local corruption _ will remain,
some experts say.
</P>
<P>
   In the Chechen capital of Grozny, the president, Aslan
Maskhadov, insisted that Chechnya is not involved in the fight
being waged on its border, which he called a ``dirty game''
probably instigated by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building an independent Chechen state rather than waging new
wars is our most important jihad'' or holy war, at the moment, said
Maskhadov, whose authority at home has been undercut by warlords
like Basayev who have forged links with religious fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   As Putin tried to bring the complex situation in the Caucasus
under control, politicians in Moscow were scrambling to position
themselves for the political season, officially opened Monday by
Yeltsin. Parliamentary elections are to be held in December and
presidential elections are due next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin _ who until Monday had been seen as a possible Kremlin
favorite in the presidential race _ was being courted Tuesday by
right-wing political parties, headed by the reformers who were once
part of Yeltsin's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepashin has a political future,'' said Sergei Kiriyenko,
another former prime minister. ``Such people must not be wasted. I
consider it right that he lead a center-right bloc.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergence last week of a center-left bloc put together
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and several powerful regional governors,
a group perceived as hostile to the Kremlin's interests, is widely
seen as a catalyst for Yeltsin's decision to fire Stepashin and
replace him with someone who will be more forceful in protecting
the Yeltsin legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts Tuesday suggested that by firing Stepashin,
Yeltsin may have freed him to become a presidential candidate in
his own right, one who would not be burdened with an endorsement by
a deeply unpopular president, but who would still be loyal to
Yeltsin's personal interests, as well as his program.

 &HT;    ABA delegates delay vote on partnership ban
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``One-stop shopping'' offering legal work along with
tax preparation and insurance might sound appealing to some
consumers, but the nation's largest group of lawyers Tuesday
determined the time for it may not be right.
</P>
<P>
   Citing serious ethical concerns governing the attorney-client
relationship, the American Bar Association's House of Delegates
delayed a vote whether to abolish a decades-old ban that prevents
lawyers from forming partnerships with non-lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The ABA's annual meeting here, held at the Georgia World
Congress Center and other hotels around the city, ends today.
</P>
<P>
   Votes by members of the House of Delegates, the ABA's
policy-making arm, signaled the winding-down of the meeting, which
attracted 13,000 lawyers, including President Clinton and
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   No issue has more sharply divided the ABA membership that the
proposal to end the ban on profit-sharing between lawyers and
non-lawyers. Supporters said the sharing of professions is
inevitable and allows U.S. firms to compete internationally with
European firms that already allow it. But opponents say it
jeopardizes the ``core values'' of the legal profession: loyalty to
the client, confidentiality and independence of lawyer judgment.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the heated debate over the issue appeared to parallel
fears raised in small-towns where drug and hardware store owners
expressed concern about the new Wal-Mart planned for construction.
</P>
<P>
   A large ``one-stop shop'' that provides legal work, accounting
and insurance will drive the solo practitioners out of business,
Cheryl Niro, a state attorney from Chicago, told the delegation.
``This is an access-to-justice issue for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jamie Gorelick, a former deputy U.S. Attorney General who is
now vice chairwoman of Fannie Mae, urged abolition of the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many, many problems that can benefit from this
approach,'' she said. ``Clients will want to look to one person to
bring a team together that crosses the boundaries between the law
and other business arenas. Whether corporate clients or individual
clients, they need that choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Lamm, a Washington lawyer, said rules can be established
to require lawyers to adhere to ethics codes.
</P>
<P>
   But others said that would be almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you enforce the ethical standards of two professions
when the same person is wearing both hats?'' asked Stephen Zack, a
Miami lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous lawyers cited concerns over how a lawyer could work
with an accountant when the lawyer must give absolute
confidentiality to a client, while accountants have a duty to
report their clients' financial irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm uneasy about it because of the conflicting obligations in
the different professions,'' Georgia Attorney General Thurbert
Baker, a member of the state's ABA delegation, said before the
vote. ``We need to show some caution.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the House of Delegates passed a resolution calling
on legislators to require police to keep statistics to help
determine whether traffic stops and searches are being conducted
for racially discriminatory reasons. It also reaffirmed its support
for the merit selection of judges.

TENSIONS RISE AS INDIA SHOOTS DOWN PAKISTANI PLANE

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ An Indian jet fighter on Tuesday shot down a
propeller-driven Pakistani naval aircraft that was flying near the
India-Pakistan border, reportedly killing all 16 people aboard and
heating up the already inflamed situation between the world's
newest nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani plane was hit by a missile in the late morning,
and by late evening each country was still asserting not only that
the aircraft had been flying in its airspace, but also that the
wreckage had fallen within its territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a routine training flight, ruthlessly shot out of the
sky without a single provocation,'' Mushahid Hussain, Pakistan's
information minister, said in a telephone interview. ``The Indians
seem to be in a very provocative and belligerent mood.''
</P>
<P>
   A sharply contradictory version was delivered by India's defense
minister, George Fernandes. He said what when the Pakistani plane,
a French-built Atlantic, was intercepted and commanded to land at
an Indian base, it ``indulged in a hostile act by taking a turn
toward the Indian fighter aircraft and challenging it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indian plane, a MiG-21, then fired a missile into the
Pakistani plane's port engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the area was thick with clouds, the fighter could not
see where the Pakistani plane went down,'' Fernandes said, though
he added that Indian helicopters later found the crash site and
were trying to examine wreckage that rested in a marshy area.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandes said that several Pakistani helicopters had also
ventured near the debris. ``We made it clear that we will not allow
them to be there,'' he said. ``We will fire. We have warned them
that any movement onto our side will be treated as hostile.''
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage rests near the border between the Indian state of
Gujarat and the Pakistani state of Sindh. The area is sometimes
known as Sir Creek, and it is the subject of one of several
boundary disputes between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's events could lead to fearsome consequences. Pakistan's
foreign minister called the incident a ``blatant unprovoked act of
military aggression'' and said, ``Pakistan reserves the right to
make an appropriate response in self-defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indian military announced that it was in a ``state of
alert.''
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan have already fought three wars in their half
century of existence. The last was in 1972, and, in recent months,
tensions have been at their highest in nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   From mid-May to late July, the Indian military fought ferocious
battles against hundreds of infiltrators who had sneaked into their
territory in the snow-capped mountains of Kashmir. India said that
the intruders were Pakistani soldiers, while Pakistan insisted that
they were Islamic warriors engaged in a holy war.
</P>
<P>
   During this fighting, India lost two fighter jets, both of which
fell in Pakistani-controlled territory. The downed aircraft were
repeatedly shown on Pakistani television. One of the two pilots was
said to have died in the crash, but when his body was returned,
Indian officials contended that an autopsy proved the man had been
tortured and shot dead.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations did manage to apply the brakes at the brink of
yet another all-out war, but since then shelling has remained heavy
across the so-called line of control that separates the parts of
Kashmir that each side controls.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 14 years, both countries have also been fighting a
high-altitude war in some of the world's least habitable terrain in
the western Himalayas near the Siachen Glacier.
</P>
<P>
   There is other fighting as well. In just the past week,
Pakistani-backed insurgents have been unusually audacious,
launching rocket attacks on Indian military bases in Kashmir. On
Sunday, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee of India said he had
asked the United States to designate Pakistan formally as a
terrorist nation.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic-1 is a twin-engine aircraft that looks similar to a
cargo plane. It is used by many navies for aerial reconnaissance
and anti-submarine combat.
</P>
<P>
   Here in New Delhi, early press accounts referred to it as a
``spy plane,'' highlighting its capacity to fire missiles and sink
submarines with torpedoes.
</P>
<P>
   But Hussain, Pakistan's information minister, said the airplane,
as operated, was ``entirely harmless'' and carried no weapons. He
confirmed that 16 people _ five of them officers _ were on board
and presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a routine flight, frequently repeated, and India was
certainly familiar with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian defense ministry, however, said that the aircraft had
been traced ``intruding'' into its air space eight times from May
to July. In a television interview, Fernandes said that Indian jets
had scrambled to confront those planes but that they ``ran away
before our aircraft could reach them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The United States on Tuesday made note of the ominous events.
``We are concerned about an increase in tensions,'' said David
Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   He said the White House was monitoring all reports of the downed
aircraft, adding that it hoped the two nations would return to
efforts toward peace that began last February when Vajpayee made a
celebrated bus trip to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   That effort, once hailed as the inevitable coming together of
two neighbors with a shared heritage, has in just a few months come
to seem an improbable pipe dream.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Russian forces continued to do battle with Islamic
militants in the mountains of the North Caucasus, Vladimir Putin,
the newly designated prime minister, said Tuesday that he had
proposed a ``package of measures'' to bring the volatile situation
under control.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from a morning meeting with President Boris Yeltsin,
who Monday anointed him as the Kremlin candidate in presidential
elections next year, Putin, the former head of Russia's domestic
intelligence service, said he hoped that these measures would quell
the Islamic fundamentalist insurrection within weeks. He did not
say what the measures were.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Islamic militants set off the crisis by crossing
the Chechen border into the neighboring Russian province of
Dagestan and seizing several mountain villages. Tuesday they issued
a statement declaring Dagestan's independence as an Islamic state,
and vowing to drive away ``infidels'' from its territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Dagestani authorities, who recently called in the Russian
army to help them fend off the threat of armed Islamic militants,
dismissed the statement as propaganda, and said it had no support
from the local population.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation in the North Caucasus promises to be the top
issue facing Putin, as he tries to prove to Yeltsin, and the
country, that he has the leadership qualities he needs to make a
serious run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real test of his ability will be the Caucasus,'' said
Andrei Piontkovsky, head of the Center for Strategic Studies in
Moscow. ``There is no clear-cut strategy now, and it will be
necessary to take very difficult decisions. In the end, it is not a
military problem, but a political problem, the same one every
Muslim state faces with its fundamentalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Unrest and lawlessness in the North Caucasus have been one of
Moscow's major security concerns since the 1994-1996 war in
Chechnya, which ended with the defeat of Russia's undisciplined and
demoralized federal forces.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Chechnya has in effect seceded from Russia, although
its independence has not been formally recognized.
</P>
<P>
   In Dagestan on Tuesday, Russian troops from both the army and
the Interior Ministry continued their attacks on the rebel
strongholds in the southwestern part of the province. Most
civilians had evacuated the villages Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the remote region were sketchy, and at times
contradictory. According to some reports, militants have been
forced out of some villages, but it is not clear where they went.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, Lt. Col. Anatoly Kornukov,
commander of the Russian air force, said that three air regiments
were involved in the campaign, and that so far, 78 reconnaissance
and attack sorties had been flown.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Kornukov said the militants have sustained heavy losses
from the air strikes, and that some have retreated, but he gave no
specifics. In the first day of fighting, a Russian airplane
accidentally struck a police station near one of the rebel bases,
killing several Dagestani policemen.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Dagestani interior minister, a Russian air
force officer was killed Monday in a mortar attack, four soldiers
were wounded and two military helicopters were burned.
</P>
<P>
   Kornukov denied charges made Monday by the government of nearby
Georgia that Russian airplanes had bombed a Georgian village.
Kornukov said Russian planes had not violated Georgian air space,
but suggested that bombs dropped along the commandoes' escape route
might have been carried overland into Georgia as a provocation.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts Tuesday, attempting to make sense of Yeltsin's
sudden decision to dump his last prime minister, Sergei Stepashin,
concluded that the president had found Putin to be a tougher, more
resolute leader.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Monday by Yeltsin how his mood was as he took over his new
job, Putin _ who began his career as a KGB officer _ answered
curtly: ``combative.'' Putin's nomination goes to the Parliament's
lower house next Monday, where he is expected to be confirmed by
deputies eager to concentrate on their reelection campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Federal Security Service, and secretary of the
Kremlin's advisory Security Council, Putin was already deeply
involved in Moscow's campaign in the Caucasus, and it is still not
clear whether his plan of action, presented Tuesday, will differ
from the course taken by the Stepashin government.
</P>
<P>
   In his parting comments to the Cabinet on Monday, Stepashin, who
returned Sunday night from a trip to Dagestan to oversee the
operation, said the coordination between the various forces,
including army and Interior Ministry troops, was poor. ''I had to
fly there and say that I was taking the responsibility myself,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to news reports, the Islamic commandoes _ adherents of
the so-called Wattabi fundamentalist sect which has been gaining
strength across Russia's northern caucasian region _ are led by
Shamil Basayev, a field commander who became a Chechen hero during
the war with Russia, and by Hattab, a shadowy Jordanian-born
guerrilla fighter who has established a military training camp in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Wattabi sect has already made inroads into Dagestan, a
region made of 33 different, mainly Muslim, ethnic groups, but in
other villages, their presence has been tolerated by authorities.
Even if Russia's latest military operations succeeded in pushing
out the latest wave of militants, the problem of rising Islamic
militancy _ fueled by poverty and local corruption _ will remain,
some experts say.
</P>
<P>
   In the Chechen capital of Grozny, the president, Aslan
Maskhadov, insisted that Chechnya is not involved in the fight
being waged on its border, which he called a ``dirty game''
probably instigated by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building an independent Chechen state rather than waging new
wars is our most important jihad'' or holy war, at the moment, said
Maskhadov, whose authority at home has been undercut by warlords
like Basayev who have forged links with religious fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   As Putin tried to bring the complex situation in the Caucasus
under control, politicians in Moscow were scrambling to position
themselves for the political season, officially opened Monday by
Yeltsin. Parliamentary elections are to be held in December and
presidential elections are due next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin _ who until Monday had been seen as a possible Kremlin
favorite in the presidential race _ was being courted Tuesday by
right-wing political parties, headed by the reformers who were once
part of Yeltsin's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepashin has a political future,'' said Sergei Kiriyenko,
another former prime minister. ``Such people must not be wasted. I
consider it right that he lead a center-right bloc.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergence last week of a center-left bloc put together
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and several powerful regional governors,
a group perceived as hostile to the Kremlin's interests, is widely
seen as a catalyst for Yeltsin's decision to fire Stepashin and
replace him with someone who will be more forceful in protecting
the Yeltsin legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts Tuesday suggested that by firing Stepashin,
Yeltsin may have freed him to become a presidential candidate in
his own right, one who would not be burdened with an endorsement by
a deeply unpopular president, but who would still be loyal to
Yeltsin's personal interests, as well as his program.

   WASHINGTON _ Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong continued
his victory lap of America Tuesday with a visit to the White House
and a lively question-and-answer session at the National Press
Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know why we're celebrating. I hope it's because
of my victory in the Tour de France, which shows that there's life
after cancer,'' said Armstrong, who beat testicular cancer after
three operations and a course of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago I wouldn't have lived six months,'' he said
during a meeting with Vice President Al Gore at the White House.
``I hope that what I did gives inspiration to people all over the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong also met with President Clinton for a photo session
and presented Clinton with a bicycle and helmet in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong gave Gore an official cycling jersey signed by his
teammates in the Tour de France, the world's premier bicycle race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some victories have an extra meaning to them,'' Gore said.
``The fact that you even began the race makes you a winner. You
captured the eyes of the nation and the hearts of the entire
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that in the aftermath of Armstrong's victory,
increased focus must be given to cancer research. He announced the
development of ``Insight Awards to Stamp Out Breast Cancer,'' a
research program that will use more than $4 million of the revenue
from the U.S. Postal Service's breast cancer research stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong also spoke Tuesday at a National Press Club luncheon,
stopping first outside the club's headquarters to give autographs
to a group of admiring bicycle messengers.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was praised at the lunch as ``a testament to the
courage, determination and triumph of the human spirit.'' Quizzed
on matters ranging from controversial to comical, Armstrong was
alternately passionate and humble in his responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you're probably used to hearing politicians speak, not
necessarily professional cyclists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong retraced his career highlights and recovery from
cancer before fielding questions from an audience that took him up
on his promise to try to answer every one.
</P>
<P>
   _ On whether his teammates on the U.S. Postal Service cycling
team receive enough credit: ``The work I did was small. It mainly
has to do with the perception of cycling in America. The sport is
really about a team. I never could have won it without this great
team. Nobody (abroad) believed in us. Next year there will be no
doubters. They probably don't get enough credit. They're not only
my teammates but friends.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On the monitoring of drug abuse in global competition: ``It
varies from sport to sport. What can you really do for substances
that aren't detectable? You can encourage athletes to be fair and
honest, but beyond that what can you do? Any time you mix big
sports with big money, you're going to have someone who wants to
cut corners.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On ways to increase cycling's popularity: ``Every sport needs
characters and personalities. Basketball wouldn't be basketball
without Michael Jordan. Fans need someone to follow. You need
events in the States. And you need junior development for the new
generation to keep the personality flow going.''

 A `DAWSON'S' PEEK: SEE SITES MADE FAMOUS BY TV SHOW

   (bl)  
 By ALLISON BALLARD   
 The Morning Star, Wilmington, N.C.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ Wilmington has become a tourist attraction.
No, not for the beautiful beaches, challenging golf courses or even
the historic homes. It has become must-see on any trip south
because of its alter ego, the fictional town of Capeside, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Those outside the teen-age and 20-something set might not know
what a grip the hit series, Dawson's Creek, has on the country.
</P>
<P>
   In its first two seasons, the high-school drama, created by
North Carolina native Kevin Williamson, has caught fire and made
stars of James Van Der Beek (Dawson), Katie Holmes (Joey), Joshua
Jackson (Pacey) and Michelle Williams (Jen). The fans have created
a ratings surge for the WB network, started numerous Web sites
devoted to the show, and made the characters a part of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Production for the third season began Monday and the series
premiere is scheduled for the end of September. In an effort to get
as much Creek as possible, though, many fans have made pilgrimages
here in hopes of meeting the stars. And while they are searching
for them, they might as well have a look around town and see some
of the places where Dawson Leery, Joey Potter, Jen Lindley and
Pacey Witter have walked, hung out, even kissed.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmington has seen a boom in teen tourism. The Cape Fear Coast
Convention and Visitors Bureau has even published a brochure
helping fans locate places that have been used for filming. And
while talk of moving Dawson's Creek to the West Coast caused local
concern, producers now say they plan to keep the show here.
</P>
<P>
   A publicist for the series explained the decision to stay was
made because the look is an important part of the show they didn't
feel they could get in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The series is filmed on a closed set that is not open to the
public. visiting fans, however, can hope for a chance sighting of
the stars. Just last week, for example, Joshua Jackson made
national news for his part in a rescue of two girls swimming off
nearby Wrightsville Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a touring guide for fans compiled from information from
the Visitors Bureau and with help from location manager Craig
Rogers. First, visitors should know Dawson's Creek is really
Hewlett's Creek. And although there is a Dawson Street in town, it
has nothing to do with the show.
</P>
<P>
   _ A great place to start is a walking tour of EUE Screen Gems
Studios at 1223 N. 23rd St., the location of the soundstages for
most of the show's interiors. Tours are available on Saturdays and
Sundays at 10 a.m., noon and 2 p.m. and cost $10 per person. The
tours are given by Silver Screen Tours; for information call (910)
675-8479. Fans can purchase Dawson's memorabilia at the Hollywood
Connection Cafe at the studio _ look for the homemade mural of the
stars.
</P>
<P>
   _ All Dawson's fans should recognize the Cape Fear Riverwalk,
which is at the end of Market Street, and Riverfront Park on Water
Street . These sites are frequently featured for smooching scenes
and brooding moments. Bonus points for those who recognize the
Riverfront Information Booth as a hot dog stand in the series.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mollye's Market, 118 Princess St., a cute grocery/eatery is
also frequently used as a hangout and shop. And nearby Island
Passage Elixir at 4 Market St. was a boutique in a recent episode.
</P>
<P>
   _ The real-life video store, Screen Play Video, 212 N. Front
St., doubles as Pacey's after-school workplace on the show. Also,
before the series became a hit, actress Holmes used to live above
the shop. By the way, Van Der Beek and Jackson used to live above
the nearby restaurant, Deluxe.
</P>
<P>
   _ The interior of Thalian Hall Center for the Performing Arts,
310 Chestnut St., served as the Rialto Theater, one of Dawson's
favorite places. Although it was mentioned in the episode when
Dawson and Joey had their first date that the theater was to be
torn down it is, in fact, still standing
</P>
<P>
   _ The IceHouse, 115 S. Water St., was Joey's workplace for the
first two seasons. In the season finale, though, the restaurant
burned. The real reason the site is not being used is because there
is an extensive construction project being completed next door.
</P>
<P>
   _ The University of North Carolina at Wilmington, 601 S. College
Road, plays the role of Capeside High, where Dawson, Joey, Jen and
Pacey go to school. The buildings are often used as a backdrop to
the action and this season the athletic fields will be used for
filming.
</P>
<P>
   _ With its boardwalks and swing sets, Greenfield Lake, 1702
Burnett Boulevard, provides a perfect place for romantic walks. On
Dawson's Creek its name is Burham Lake.
</P>
<P>
   _ Serious fans may want to head down Airlie Road to Airlie
Gardens, which is sometimes used as a romantic spot. Also,
Battleship Park on Eagles Island was the site of the show's Winter
Fair.
</P>
<P>
   _ This season, The Cape Fear Seafood Co., 100 Yacht Basin Drive
in Southport, will be a new hangout for the Capeside gang.
Producers for the show are changing the inside of the building from
a fish house to a marina, said Larry Potter, owner of the shop. The
tentative title for the site on the show is Logan's Marina. Other
places in scenic Southport are likely to been seen in the drama
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scouts have been on the lookout for locales to film football
games and practices this season, perhaps to capitalize on the
success of Van Der Beek's hit sports movie, Varsity Blues. Legion
Stadium on Carolina Beach Road will be one of the locations.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of Dawson's Creek FAQ Sheet are available from the Cape
Fear Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau by calling (800) 222-4757
or by sending e-mail to info(AT)cape-fear.nc.us.

PARABLES OF FEMALE SEXUALITY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Matt Wolf is the London theater critic of Variety.  
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British television is famous for being unbuttoned about
sex. Still, ``Love in the 21st Century,'' the six-part series on
Channel 4 that concludes on Aug. 25, is prompting debate.
</P>
<P>
   There's the moment in ``Toy-Boys'' in which a 30-something
teacher (played by Clare Holman) ends up in a clinch with a dishy
male student whom she is all too happy to take camping. That Ryan
(Matt Kennard) is only 15 makes the encounter not just unusual but
also illegal. Catherine Johnson's script ends with a twist
characteristic of the series as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``Fantasies,'' another script by Ms. Johnson (who
wrote this season's surprise West End theater hit ``Mama Mia!''),
in which a couple's visit to Lola's Love Boutique unleashes a
spirit of erotic adventure in Anna (Tracy Whitwell), a young nurse,
that Sean (Tommy Tiernan), her kindly if increasingly bewildered
boyfriend, doesn't always share.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Ioan Gruffudd, the rising Welsh star of ``Horatio
Hornblower'' and ``Great Expectations'' (shown in the United States
on A&AMP;E and PBS respectively) can be seen shedding rather more than
period garb. He's the one in ``Masturbation'' caught in the act by
his girlfriend, Amanda (Natasha Little, recently seen parading her
own period appeal as Becky Sharp in ``Vanity Fair'').
</P>
<P>
   ``All my male friends will tune in to this,'' said Gruffudd, 25,
speaking by telephone from Los Angeles. ``Anything to do with sex,
they turn it on: it's a very typical, laddish attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The flesh content, to be fair, isn't what distinguishes ``Love
in the 21st Century.'' (Tellingly, the show went through several
title changes _ ``How to Have Sex in the 21st Century'' and the
more concise ``Sex in the 21st Century'' _ before arriving at the
less carnally centered name it now bears.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by the standards of another of the year's
much-talked-about Channel 4 series, the gay-themed ``Queer as
Folk,'' from the same production company, the new show is
positively G-rated.
</P>
<P>
   But if Gruffudd's blokish friends have been tuning in, they've
been finding subjects and emotions not frequently shown on screen,
including the startling extremes (apparently) of female jealousy
and paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, women _ and not their men _ drive the various half-hour
stories, each of which has a separate cast and stands on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``In `Love in the 21st Century,' women aren't all good; women
aren't all nice. Women are just human beings,'' said Nicola
Shindler, 30, the executive producer and co-creator (with Ms.
Johnson) of the series. ``It presents women as they are in
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Reproduction,'' Catherine McCormack plays a chippie (not
what Americans might think but an employee in a fish and chips
shop) named Fay who is hitting 30 and regards John (David Tennant),
a local doctor, as her best prospect for impregnation.
</P>
<P>
   The subject matter, says Ms. Shindler, ``really hits the
Zeitgeist; it's so much of its time.'' The scenes inside Fay's body
won't surprise anyone who has seen Woody Allen's 1972 film
``Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Marking out medicine as the series' profession of choice,
``Threesomes'' introduces another doctor _ the charmingly caddish
Charlie (Oliver Milburn) _ who severs forever the lifelong rapport
between two best (and female) friends. Though it was the second of
the six shows to be broadcast, ``Threesomes'' was the first story
line that the creators came up with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The received wisdom is that girls will be pals no matter what,
that no man will ever be able to rend them asunder,'' said Ms.
Johnson, 41, a divorced mother of two.
</P>
<P>
   But, Ms. Johnson said of the ``Threesomes'' scenario, ``I think
in real life you would never forgive your friend for doing that.
There's a lot written about the sisterhood, but actually women can
behave very badly toward one another.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last show, ``Commitment,'' Daniela Nardini, who played
Anna in the BBC hit ``This Life,'' is a factory owner who puts her
boyfriend, Jason Flemyng, through numerous emotional hoops only to
rush out in a fit of nerves once the two at long last reach the
altar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really disspelling the myth about that cosmopolitan image
of women, that they're not interested in marriage anymore,'' said
Matt Jones, 30, who wrote ``Commitment'' and was script editor on
the entire series. ``We kind of laughed that this is a very
reactionary tale. What's wrong with wanting someone who is going to
be there for you forever?''
</P>
<P>
   If the story lines hint at political incorrectness, that sits
just fine with the creators of the series, whose goal has been to
speak from a feminine perspective without putting women on a
pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Undoubtedly, the series communicates a feeling that certain
things have been confused, have been lost,'' said Gub Neal, Channel
4's commissioning editor for drama. ``We're debunking the mythology
that magazines like Elle and Marie Claire propagate by means of
reassurance: in other words, that women really would sleep with
their best friend's boyfriend if they thought they could get away
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are really little parables about female sexuality,''
added Neal, 40, ``each of them trying to shed some light on the way
the world really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal is sufficiently excited by the finished product to have
encouraged Ms. Johnson to consider a second set of six shows, this
time examining the proverbial battle between the sexes from the
man's point of view. Not that men, he said, seem to be put off by
the series; it has averaged 1.7 million viewers per show, which in
Britain is a huge audience.
</P>
<P>
   (``Queer as Folk'' was attracting nearly 4 million viewers by
the end of its run, but its gay content made it a subject of
tabloid controversy, which is always a ratings booster.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's very sexy, so we think a lot of men are watching
it,'' Neal said of ``Love in the 21st Century.'' ``They'll see the
title `Masturbation' go up and say, `Hey, that's me'; they'll see
the title `Commitment' go up and think, `That's not me.'''

LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES AGREES TO BUY CONSULTING COMPANY FOR $3.7
BILLION IN STOCK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies Inc. said Tuesday that it had agreed to buy
International Network Services Inc., a fast-growing consulting
company, for $3.7 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   For Lucent, North America's biggest maker of communications
equipment, the deal is a bid to move beyond merely making
complicated communications gear and expand its ability to help big
corporate clients install and use it.
</P>
<P>
   International Network, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., is
essentially a temporary-employment agency for network engineers.
Most of the company's 2,200 employees are digital trouble-shooters
who help big companies and communications carriers design and
manage complex networks. The companies' clients have included AT&AMP;T,
Bell Atlantic, First Union, Mastercard International and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   International Network earned $10 million in the last quarter on
revenue of $94.1 million, up sharply from a profit of $5.2 million
on revenue of $52.5 million in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent's Netcare operation provides many of the same services
but may have been held back by its identification with Lucent. Even
though Cisco Systems Inc. owns 8 percent of International Network,
one of the company's selling points with potential clients has been
that its independence allows it to suggest the best networking
products without bias. Now that the company is part of Lucent, its
consultants may have to assure clients that they will not become
prejudiced in favor of Lucent's products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The convergence of voice and data is driving tremendous demand
for services and support,'' Richard A. McGinn, Lucent's chairman,
said in a statement. ``Together, Lucent and INS will offer
customers the industry's deepest portfolio of network planning,
design, integration, maintenance and management solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Cisco, the big data networking player, said it would
invest about $1 billion in KPMG, the consulting company, in a bid
to jointly offer Internet and networking consulting services.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's deal may improve the prospects for the coming initial
public offering of Predictive Systems Inc., which, like
International Network, provides networking consulting services.
Predictive, based in New York, is seeking to raise as much as $52
million. Predictive counts Qwest Communications International Inc.
and Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. among its clients.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of Tuesday's deal, each share of INS will be
exchanged for 0.8473 share of Lucent. Based on Lucent's closing
share price of $63.625 on Monday, the deal is worth about $54 for
each share of International Network. Shares of International
Network closed Monday at $47.4375, giving the deal a premium of
about 13.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent said it would account for the deal as a pooling of
interest, allowing the company to evade goodwill charges against
its future earnings to cover the difference between International
Network's book value and what Lucent is paying.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent said the deal would not affect its earnings in its 2000
fiscal year, which begins in October, but the company's shares fell
$2, to $61.625. Shares of International Network rose $3, to
$50.4375.
</P>
<P>
   John L. Drew, the chief executive of International Network and a
former executive for the Unisys Corp., will become the head of the
expanded Netcare organization, which will include International
Network and have 5,500 employees.
</P>
<P>
   But he is not the deal's primary beneficiary. Instead, Donald K.
McKinney, the founder of International Network, will become the
latest Silicon Valley billionaire. In the deal, McKinney's roughly
32.1 percent stake in the company will become worth almost $1.2
billion.

police telephoned his wife so she would hear his screams under
torture. Instead, the one-time school teacher unearthed a mountain
of records detailing repression among U.S.-backed military regimes
throughout South America during the Cold War. From floor to

A LATIN-INDIAN-ROCK SOUND STIRS URBAN PERU  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ Whenever there was a good harvest in ancient times,
according to Quechua Indian legend, the Earth Goddess sent
fun-loving dwarfs called Los Shapis to frolic under a giant rainbow
and help the peasants celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   It has been many centuries since Los Shapis were last seen in
the Andes, but they are back now in Lima. In their new form, Los
Shapis play electric guitars and keyboards, pound drums to a Latin
tropical beat and sing about unrequited love and the misery of
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a street vendor, I am a proletarian, I am humble,'' sang
Julio Simeon Salguiaran, 38, the lead singer of the group, his
voice droning one of the group's biggest hits in a sad monotone.
But the 400 youths at a concrete soccer field on Saturday night to
hear Los Shapis danced to the music and appeared anything but
depressed by the words.
</P>
<P>
   Los Shapis are one of many bands that are playing a new form of
Peruvian popular music that has touched a chord among migrant
youths of Indian origin who are trying to retain vestiges of their
Andean cultural heritage even as they adapt to modern urban life.
</P>
<P>
   The genre mixes singing styles and melodies from huayno
(pronounced WHY-no), the traditional music of the central Andean
highlands, with the tropical rhythms of cumbia, the music of
coastal Colombia, and then adds some rock touches from the Beatles,
the Rolling Stones and Santana.
</P>
<P>
   The blending first began in the 1970s in the slums of Lima that
sprouted up along the highways connecting the capital with the
central highlands, as Indian musicians from across Peru came in
contact with one another and lived together for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread misery in the countryside, made worse by a failed
land reform by a leftist military government in the 1970s, pushed
the peasants off the land and into the cities. Lima has nearly
tripled in size, from 2.8 million inhabitants to 8 million, since
1970. The earliest Indian migrants quickly assimilated, giving up
their languages and customs as they sought employment in factories
and as street merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian anthropologists and sociologists say the new music has
shown that a new cultural quilt is emerging in Lima that combines
Indian and white threads.
</P>
<P>
   The music ``is linked to the process of the Andeanization of
Lima,'' said Raul Romero Cevallos, director of the Center of Andean
Ethnomusicology at the Catholic University of Peru. ``It is a new
cultural style created by Andean migrants to the cities as an
attempt to create a new sense of identity and that is very
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, longtime Lima residents, who were shocked by the waves
of Indian migrants overcrowding the capital, stigmatized the new
genre as lower-class music that appealed only to drifters and
melancholy Indians. But sensing the commercial power of the
migrants, local radio stations began to play it in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, several music and dance shows featuring
the music have cropped up on Peruvian television, which
traditionally appealed only to the wealthier white audience.
Cassettes of the music are now at the top of the Peruvian charts,
but complete sales figures are difficult to come by because pirated
cassettes are so prominent in Lima.
</P>
<P>
   As the great Peruvian migration moved beyond Lima to around
South America, Europe and the United States in recent years, the
new music has gone along with it. It has become a hit on Argentine
cable television, and bands playing it have made appearances in
nightclubs as far away as Paris, Tokyo, Washington, Port Chester,
N.Y., and Paterson, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Even President Alberto Fujimori has declared himself a fan. He
recently appeared in public embracing Rossy War, a star whose
trademarks include high leather boots and miniskirts trimmed with
pearl-white beads. Fujimori was probably trying to appeal to urban
youths as he plans his re-election campaign at a time when some
stars and managers are making increasingly explicit political
statements about unemployment and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, a night listening and dancing to the
music of Los Shapis is just a good time, and an excuse to drink
beer.
</P>
<P>
   Under the swirling lights of a kaleidoscope ball, Salguiaran and
his group strut, kick and dance a neat three-step in unison. They
dress in black and white athletic warm-up suits and their banner is
appropriately a rainbow in honor of the ancient, erotic dwarfs.
</P>
<P>
   Repetitive guitar riffs in high C have something of a hypnotic
effect, and the words of the songs are catchy, even if depressing.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd lights up with smiles as Salguiaran _ a squat, rather
uncharismatic man whose stage name is Chapulin _ sings old
favorites like ``Little Drunk for Love'' and a song called ``El
Aguajal,'' named after the juice of an exotic tropical fruit, that
goes: ``There are lovers. There are objects of affection. They are
all traitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Elena Pancaya, a 20-year-old Los Shapis fan, said the melancholy
music did not bother her at all. ``The songs are sad, but they
remind us of our families and our hopes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Salguiaran said that the music ``is popular
because it speaks to the lives of the people _ the stories of the
street vendors, the drivers, the students.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's about life and love.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted a great future for the genre, one that would put it
right up there with rock and the blues.
</P>
<P>
   The music ``originated in Huancayo,'' he said, referring to a
highland city. ``Then it triumphed in Lima, and in the future it
will triumph all over the world.''

TWO WINSTON CUP TEAM MEMBERS SUSPENDED IN RACIAL INCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two NASCAR Winston Cup team members were put on indefinite
suspension by the sanctioning body and subsequently fired from
their jobs as motorcoach drivers for Derrike Cope and Terry Labonte
because of a racially insensitive prank they played on a black crew
member of Jeremy Mayfield's team.
</P>
<P>
   The incident took place July 8 as Winston Cup teams arrived at
New Hampshire International Speedway in Loudon, N.H. for the July
11 Jiffy Lube 300.
</P>
<P>
   According to Chip Williams, a spokesman for the Penske-Kranefuss
Racing team, David Scott, a motorcoach driver for Mayfield's team,
answered a knock at the vehicle's door and was greeted by the two
motorcoach drivers, one of whom wore a pillowcase over his head in
an apparent impersonation of a Ku Klux Klansman.
</P>
<P>
   According to Williams, Scott declined comment on the matter.
However, Michael Kranefuss, the car owner who lodged a complaint
with NASCAR on Scott's behalf, issued a statement applauding
NASCAR's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Penske-Kranefuss Racing and Jeremy Mayfield fully support
NASCAR's response to the behavior directed at one of our team
members,'' Kranefuss said. ``We and the team member stand together
and look forward to putting the incident behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to reports that the incident stemmed from an argument,
Williams said there was ``no fight, no argument, no physical
confrontation, or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   According to reports, the situation was characterized by those
close to the incident as a joke that went too far. But no one at
NASCAR thought it was a laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes down to it, whatever the reason was behind it,
whatever the motivation was, there are certain things that can't be
tolerated in this day and age,'' said Kevin Triplett, NASCAR's
director of operations. ``There's a certain professionalism with
being involved in any occupation, and there's zero tolerance for
anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The team members, whose names were not disclosed by their
employers, were immediately terminated when NASCAR handed down the
suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behavior like this simply cannot be tolerated in today's
society,'' said Cope. ``This was an example of grievous behavior
that I do not condone. It was an ignorant act, and I took the only
course available to me of rectifying the situation by terminating
the employee.''

TV SHOULD REFLECT LIFE'S DIVERSITY
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Tuesday, Aug. 17)  
(yn) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk turned to the good old days when kids came home from school
and watched the Mickey Mouse Club. Everyone started to recall their
favorite Mousketeer and Barbara Love, an African-American, quietly
excused herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I wanted to say was I thought the Mickey Mouse Club was
pretty racist. But if I had, then someone would have said, `Oh
Barbara, don't be such a downer. Is everything about race with
you?' Which would mean, `Can't you sit here and accommodate us and
let us be comfortable?'''
</P>
<P>
   The Mickey Mouse Club made her feel bad when she was a young
girl, because no Mousketeer looked like her or any other
African-American. Annette Funicello came the closest to being a
person of color. And she wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kinds of shows weren't fun for me. I watched through a
much different lens,'' says Barbara, a Headstart administrator in
Santa Rosa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years post-Mickey Mouse Club, the issue comes up again.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
wants to know where the black faces are on prime-time TV. A
Hispanic advocacy group asks the same, why the ``brownout'' of
Hispanics?
</P>
<P>
   There's an antidote, however, to white bread television, and
that's reality. For a healthy dose of it, try the video ``The Way
Home,'' produced by the World Trust in Oakland, Calif. It's a
compelling, frank discussion about oppression by 64 women who vary
in identity from Arab to Jewish to Afro-American to
European-American.
</P>
<P>
   They relate how they've all felt outside the circle _ and the
divide goes beyond black and white. A group of Jewish women talk
about how Ashkenazi Jews discriminate against Sephardic Jews. A
Vietnamese student in San Francisco says she feels cut out by
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
   Arab women say they're routinely stopped by security guards in
airports. A white waitress admits being surprised that Asians know
so much about wine.
</P>
<P>
   They speak of the self-disgust that comes from racism. An
African-American says, ``I had nappy hair but thank God I had the
lightest skin.'' A Jewish woman confesses that when someone told
her she didn't look Jewish, she said, ``thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Women of mixed blood wonder where they belong. The white
grandparents of a half-black woman won't introduce her to their
friends. An Afro-Cuban is shunned by Latinas.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Love helped work on ``The Way Home'' and is promoting it
in Northern California, starting to take it around to schools,
churches and employee groups. The theme is similar to the popular
``Color of Fear,'' produced a few years back, in which eight men of
different races discuss their resentments and fear of one another.
</P>
<P>
   The mood of the women in ``The Way Home'' is less
confrontational, but it still hits the mark. No one gets to deny
their own prejudice, even if it means sitting silently and wincing,
remembering how your Gidget-style adolescence kept non-whites off
the pajama party list.
</P>
<P>
   The intent of the video is to make a dent in racism _ which most
people agree is bad _ by discussing it, which most people find
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants it to be all right without talking about it,''
says Barbara. ``They want to say, ``That was my ancestor's thing,
not mine.' Or they say, ``We've come a long way.'''
</P>
<P>
   If so, why doesn't everyone get to see faces like theirs on TV _
``someone with my nose, my hair, my lovely eyes,'' asks Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally you'd watch the video with a group of friends and then
afterward admit to those ugly notions that crept in from childhood
and the slurs you let pass at work.
</P>
<P>
   In our culture the white person, who is still entitled, can make
the choice to work on racism or not. If white people desire
diversity, in our communities and on TV, we have to also demand it.
</P>
<P>
   Saying nothing is a different vote. A young European-American
says in the video, ``Keeping silent is how I hold onto my
privilege.''

PATRIOTS BEATING THE BUSH FOR LINEBACKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ There's only one viable solution: Do not let
the important players play until the season starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are so banged up that Tuesday they were holding
auditions, bringing in veteran linebacker Steven Morrison, formerly
of the Indianapolis Colts, and former Tampa Bay running back and
special teams player Jerry Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they may take a look at former Cleveland Browns and
New York Jets linebacker Pepper Johnson and are seeking a backup
tight end and a reserve veteran defensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to some teams, we're not doing too badly,'' said vice
president of player personnel Bobby Grier Tuesday. ``We've had the
big injury to Ted (Johnson), and there's no question that's huge,
but we have others that we've held back and others like Willie
McGinest, Chris Slade who have been able to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are certainly acting on the side of caution where
tight end Ben Coates is concerned. Though he has dressed in pads
for a few days, Coates has yet to take part in any hitting after
spraining his knee early in camp. Grier expects the Patriots to go
very slowly with their future Hall-of-Famer; he probably won't play
in Friday night's exhibition opener against the Washington
Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Grier has had to redefine some of his personnel priorities with
the losses of Johnson (likely for the season), defensive tackle
Henry Thomas (for two or three weeks), and defensive end Sterling
Palmer (bruised disk in his back, day-to-day).
</P>
<P>
   Grier also is without the services of Shawn Stuckey, a
linebacker who played on special teams last season. Stuckey is in a
custody battle for his younger brother and needs time to sort
things out.
</P>
<P>
   With the Patriots so thin at middle linebacker, Pepper Johnson
is becoming more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pepper's name came up,'' said Grier. ``We understand he's
working out, so that's something we may consider over the next few
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not steal an ex-Jet? It's usually the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Patriots dumped Lovett Purnell to Baltimore for a
seventh-round pick, they also left themselves thin at tight end.
Rod Rutledge, the team's No. 2 draft pick two years ago, continues
to show he's a superb blocker, but his receiving remains suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Grier is looking for an H-back type. He has one long shot in
camp, Wabash's Jamie Bowers, who appears to catch everything thrown
his way. But Grier and Pete Carroll understand that Bowers comes
from a Division 3 program and is overmatched in certain situations.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive line is full of ends, but there isn't enough brawn
in the middle. Grier is looking for another ``Henry Thomas type,''
and some older defensive linemen are expected into camp soon.
</P>
<P>
   As for the running back situation, Kevin Faulk continues to show
good things, but the team has had few reservations about seeking
more veteran help. They would consider Ellison more for special
teams than running back, and the endless talks with Terry Allen
were still going on as late as Tuesday. Grier feels the Patriots
still have a good shot at Allen because the Falcons, embroiled in
the Jamal Anderson fiasco, have re-signed Harold Green, while the
Detroit Lions seem to be content with Barry Sanders's heir
apparent, Ron Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Grier was unsure why Tyrone Wheatley didn't take the Patriots'
offer rather than sign with Oakland, which already has Napoleon
Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   A trade? A player-for-player trade in the NFL?
</P>
<P>
   Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   It makes too much sense to trade Vincent Brisby to the Dallas
Cowboys for Chris Warren. The Cowboys could use a receiver, the
Patriots a running back. The cap numbers aren't far off, either.
But trades, unless they involve draft picks, are seldom made in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   So for now, the Patriots are forced to go with what they have
and come up with some veteran backup help if they can find it.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots fans give a collective sigh of relief every time Terry
Glenn, Willie McGinest, and Brisby get through a practice without
getting hurt. The Patriots have paid close attention to McGinest,
making sure they don't overload him, while at the same time trying
to test the groin/hip/stomach area that has been McGinest's weak
spot for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery in the groin area may have eased some pressure, but
McGinest said Tuesday he's about 80-85 percent and feels some
soreness from the operation he had two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest will play Friday, but he said, ``I'm not doing nothing
stupid.'' McGinest wants to test himself, but not at the risk of
injury, in exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to prove anything against the Washington
Redskins,'' said McGinest. ``I've got to be smart. I understand the
team needs me for Sept. 12 against the New York Jets, and that's
what I'm trying to get ready for. I don't need to impress anybody
until that time.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point it's the right attitude to take. Glenn, who has
also been worked hard in camp, could probably step back a bit and
start gearing up for the Jets as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't busted Terry deep yet,'' said Grier. ``We're taking
it slow with that, and when we feel he's ready, we'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there is pressure, on both players and management, to
get injured players back on the field. But in this case, the
Patriots might be best served by using Sean Morey and Nafis Karim a
lot and saving Troy Brown, Glenn, Shawn Jefferson, and Brisby for
when it counts. They'd be better off throwing Greg Spires and
Willie Cohens at defensive end and saving McGinest for the real
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   And why would you play Bruce Armstrong except in the final
exhibition game? He's finally healthy and in the best shape of his
career. Losing him now would be stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Really, is there any reason why Coates or Thomas has to play
more than one exhibition game to be ready for the regular season?
Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons we may never know, the Patriots have become a
fragile team. They may not have any choice but to protect their
players until the bell rings.

OFF THE COB, USE YOUR IMAGINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating with dining category code)  (lh) 
 By JACK BISHOP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's only so much you can do with a whole ear of corn. How
many flavored butters can one cook devise?
</P>
<P>
   But take the kernels off the cobs, and the possibilities expand
exponentially. Chowders, salsas, salads, griddlecakes, breads,
muffins and savory custards can all begin with fresh corn off the
cob.
</P>
<P>
   True, kernels cut loose don't have quite the glamour of a whole
ear steamed and dripping butter or charred from the grill. And cans
and freezers haven't helped matters: just the thought of those
mushy, flavorless pellets is enough to stop a cook's creativity
cold.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time of year when daily indulgence may be making corn
on the cob taste a little dull, a few knife strokes can open up new
possibilities for making more of the American symbol of summer. The
cooked kernels can even be turned into creamed corn to make a side
dish worlds away from the canned kind.
</P>
<P>
   Whole kernels sliced off the cob _ cooked or raw _ work best in
most dishes, but for baking, grated raw corn has better texture.
The whole ears can be run over the coarse holes on a four-sided
grater to produce a thick and juicy puree that can be added to
batters for griddlecakes, muffins or corn bread.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite summer side dish in my house is savory corn
griddlecakes flavored with Parmesan and chives. They take just 10
minutes to make; the batter is nothing more than grated corn
enriched with an egg and a little flour and then ladled into a hot
skillet. The cooked cakes are golden brown on the outside, creamy
on the inside and full of fresh corn flavor. I serve them with
grilled steak, since they absorb the meat's juices wonderfully, or
tucked under a grilled salmon fillet.
</P>
<P>
   To a novice cook, cutting the kernels off a long, pointed ear of
corn may seem daunting. But there is an easy and safe technique:
snap the ears in the middle to break them in half, then stand each
piece up on its flat end, so it stays steady. Then slide a sharp
chef's knife down the length of the cob on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   With most recipes, the cobs can be tossed into the trash or onto
the compost heap. But they can actually be used to make a quick
corn broth for soup or chowder or to enhance the corn flavor in
dishes with rice. Cover them with cold water in a pot, and simmer
20 minutes to extract the remaining juices from the cobs.
</P>
<P>
   Cooked kernels are even more versatile than raw, especially for
salads. Grill the corn when you want a sweeter, caramelized flavor
that can stand up to strongly flavored ingredients like chilies.
Boil the ears when you want pure corn flavor.
</P>
<P>
   I like to combine boiled corn with diced roasted red peppers,
parsley, olive oil and lemon juice to make a quick relish for fish
or chicken. Lightly caramelized grilled corn makes a classic summer
salad with tomatoes, basil, red onion, olive oil and red wine
vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   Grilled or boiled corn can also be turned into chunky salsas.
Corn works especially well with soft, juicy fruits like mangoes or
peaches as well as with chilies and fresh herbs. It can also be
used in a salsa with black beans, tomatoes, lime juice, cilantro,
chilies and a little minced garlic or shallot.
</P>
<P>
   Some people like to eat corn raw, but I prefer to cook it, on or
off the cob. A quick dunk in boiling water _ no more than a minute
or two _ makes corn off the cob much more tender.
</P>
<P>
   Raw corn kernels can also go right into the cooking pot with
almost any green vegetable. I throw some corn into a pan of
simmering green beans just before the beans are tender and let them
both cook another minute or so before draining the pot and tossing
the vegetables with an herb vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   A cup or two of raw corn kernels and a handful of minced fresh
herbs make an excellent last-minute addition to a pot of steamed
white rice or soft polenta. The heat from the grains will soften
the corn in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to saute corn off the cob. I stir raw corn
kernels into a pan of sauteed wild mushrooms, add a splash or two
of stock, water or cream and cook it just until the corn is tender,
no more than five minutes. You could omit the liquid, but sauteed
corn can be a little tough. The liquid also keeps it from
scorching.
</P>
<P>
   For a creamier, richer dish, I braise kernels in a covered pan
filled with a cup or so of stock or water for every four cups of
corn. The steam coaxes out starch from the corn, which helps to
thicken the liquid into a silky sauce. A little butter can be
swirled in at the end, or a few tablespoons of cream can be added
and simmered until the liquid thickens.
</P>
<P>
   When boiling or grilling corn, I often intentionally cook too
many ears. After dinner, I cut off the kernels and refrigerate them
in airtight containers. (You could keep the corn on the cob; it may
stay a tad juicier. But in most cases, you will be moistening the
kernels anyway, and I would rather just get rid of the cobs.)
</P>
<P>
   Cutting off the cooked kernels is also an ideal solution for
leftovers. An uneaten ear of corn can't be reheated, and is likely
to be left moldering in the refrigerator. But it's hard to resist a
bowlful of kernels, cleaned and ready for anything from muffins to
quesadillas.

EXPULSIONS INVOLVING STUDENTS CARRYING GUNS TO SCHOOL DECLINING,
REPORT INDICATES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although the nation continues to struggle with
deadly classroom violence, an Education Department report indicates
the number of students expelled for bringing weapons to school is
dropping.
</P>
<P>
   That number fell 31 percent nationally during the 1997-98
academic year, the department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, which led the nation in total number of students
expelled for toting weapons, expulsions dropped 20 percent. Texas
has the second-largest student population in 1997, at 3.97 million,
behind California with 6.29 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Education Department's study, a compilation of state figures
on school expulsions, found that 3,930 students nationwide from
elementary through high school were expelled in 1997-98 for weapons
possession, the most recent year for which statistics are
available. During the prior school year, 1996-97, 5,724 students
were expelled.
</P>
<P>
   The report said 424 Texas students were expelled for weapons in
1997-98. In 1996-97, 532 pupils were expelled.
</P>
<P>
   Of the expelled students, 33 were in elementary school, 136 were
in middle school and 255 were in high school, the Education
Department reported. The federal report is based on disciplinary
action only.
</P>
<P>
   The expulsion requirement is called for under the federal
Gun-Free Schools Act, which required U.S. states and territories to
enact laws calling for expulsion for at least one year whenever a
weapon is carried to school. The Education Department report is
designed to measure the progress of the 1994 act.
</P>
<P>
   The federal report's release follows tragic shootings last
spring at Colorado and Atlanta-area high schools. Local and federal
school safety officials on hand Tuesday in Washington for the
report's release said those tragedies are sobering reminders that
parents and community leaders must pay greater attention to what
children are doing before, during and after school.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Marquis, police chief for the Houston Independent School
District, said too many parents expect schools to be a ``catch
all'' for children, serving not only as places to learn but also to
receive moral guidance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfair to have these expectations of schools,'' said
Marquis, who joined Education Secretary Richard Riley in releasing
the report. The police chief said that moral values should be
taught at home.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-area schools, in the aftermath of the Colorado and
Georgia violence, have taken extraordinary steps to discourage
children from bringing guns to school when classes resume this
month.
</P>
<P>
   For example, HISD prohibits students from carrying firearms,
knives with blades longer than three inches, BB and pellet guns,
replicas of guns, razor blades, utility knives, live ammunition and
laser pens or pointers. Also the HISD police force has created a
Special Response Team of 17 officers who are training in methods to
evacuate schools safely.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby Pasadena Independent School District, students
have 30 days to switch to book bags and backpacks that are
transparent. Pasadena schools will have more and better video
surveillance equipment at all intermediate and high schools; a
standardized dress or uniform policy at all campuses; photo
identification badges at all high schools; and hand-held metal
detectors for use at elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   But safety measures alone are insufficient, Marquis said.
Children disposed to violence must be identified and helped before
they come to school, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to look at this from not just one angle, but all
angles,'' Marquis said. ``It's going to take the community to solve
these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley praised the federal law for discouraging students from
bringing guns to school but said recent violence on campus
highlights the need for parents and communities to become more
involved in their children's lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that all of us _ parents, educators, students and
all citizens _ can look to this new school year with hope, not with
fear,'' Riley said. ``But more needs to be done and this can only
happen if every community puts its heart and soul into reconnecting
with all of our children. Our schools simply cannot do it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Riley and Marquis at the press conference were school
safety officials from Denver and Atlanta, cities near the suburban
communities of Columbine, Colo., and Conyers, Ga., that were
gripped in school violence this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Ray, security director at Denver Public Schools, and
Karen Hall, a lieutenant at Atlanta Public Schools, echoed the
other officials in calling for greater community involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said the key to preventing school violence is identifying
and treating the ``red-flag'' students prone to violence before
they get to campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes not just law enforcement, but the whole community,''
Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before the Education Department issued its report, an
independent group released a study of student opinions that found a
drop of 7 percent from last year in the number of pupils who said
they always feel safe at school. The group, the Alexandria,
Va-based Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, also
found an 8 percent decline in the number of students who said they
believe teachers and administrators have taken all necessary steps
to make pupils safe and secure.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials, however, dismissed the group's findings. They
noted that the survey of 1,327 households was conducted between
April 22 and May 25, when the Colorado and Georgia shootings were
fresh in people's minds.

POST-COLUMBINE HIGH DRAMAS TAKE ON TEEN ALIENATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ A telling moment in the pilot of the new
series ``Manchester Prep'' involves a handful of pampered
princesses strutting down the middle of the school hallway, bumping
everyone in their path while saying ``move'' in a snooty,
harmonious melody.
</P>
<P>
   Early on in this campy drama, scheduled to premiere this fall on
Fox, it's clear that this is a place of the haves, have-lots and
have-absolutely-everythings. The point: No matter what your social
standing or bank balance, there's always someone perched a rung
higher, looking ``down'' on you _ and snickering.
</P>
<P>
   These are no longer ``Happy Days'' when it comes to high-school
life. Carefree frolicking, easily digestible lessons and mild
sexual banter are passe. ``Manchester Prep'' is just one of a
half-dozen shows coming this fall that are set in high schools and
feature scenes of peer cruelty, psychological torture and
introspective despair. In these shows, the hierarchy of adolescence
is not only well-defined, it takes on a serious, realistic tone.
``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Moesha'' and ``7th Heaven,'' these shows
aren't.
</P>
<P>
   In NBC's new drama ``Freaks and Greeks,'' for instance, a key
character is slammed into the wall while his peers burst into
laughter. In Fox's ``Popular,'' a girl looks at her classmates in
utter disgust, describing them as cattle. ``Look at them. They
dress alike, talk alike, are terrified of having an opinion or
being different because they risk being judged.'' In ``Malcolm in
the Middle,'' also on Fox, a bully trying to flatten his prey
misses, only to hit a boy in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Real'' producer Clyde Phillips is planning an episode in
which a main character's smoke-bomb prank gets out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to pull any punches with this episode,''
Phillips says of the Fox drama. ``We don't mention Columbine
specifically. But there is a line from the principal saying `in
light of recent incidents ...' Just like the title, we want to get
it real.''
</P>
<P>
   How well _ or oddly _ timed.
</P>
<P>
   The world of jocks and nerds, preppies and geeks, artsys and
brainiacs has been under the microscope ever since the murderous
assault in a Colorado high school shed light on the harmful fallout
of cliques, and how teen-age alienation and anger can produce
deadly consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Producers and network executives say the slew of teen-oriented
dramas is their attempt to lure young adults, who have been
successfully courted by the music and movie industries, and by the
WB, with its advertiser-friendly ``Dawson's Creek'' and
``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   With this focus on youth, perhaps it was inevitable that the
Columbine High School tragedy would reverberate through prime time.
But is this a good thing? Can shows be ``too'' realistic?
</P>
<P>
   Whether by economic design or merely by attempting to explore
difficult situations, television now finds itself dramatizing some
of the very issues that were at the core not only of the killings
at Columbine but of shootings in Pearl, Miss.; West Paducah, Ky,;
Jonesboro, Ark.; and Springfield, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The WB Entertainment President Susanne Daniels said the other
day that producer Brenda Hampton is planning several episodes next
season that deal with teen alienation for both ``7th Heaven'' and
her new family series, ``Safe Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our producers are really thinking about this issue,''
Daniels said. ``And I feel we're in the forefront of this with a
series like `Popular.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, ``Popular.'' It's an hourlong drama that explores
acceptance within the teen caste system. It stars Carly Pope
(''Disturbing Behavior'') as Sam, who is navigating the corridors
of the ``in'' crowd. Geeky but pretty under the frizzy hair and
baggy Salvation Army clothes, she's also something of a confused
bird: She wants in but doesn't quite know how to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the gorgeous, tight-sweater-wearing Brooke (Leslie
Bibb), who feels crushed by the pressure to be, well, perfect.
</P>
<P>
   In narration, the girls express disgust and contempt for each
other. It's clear that they are on a collision course; the
collision happens when Sam's mother gets engaged to Brooke's
father, thrusting each into the other's world literally overnight.
</P>
<P>
   While the broad outlines of the basic high-school drama remain
intact, there are significant changes inside the picture.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   In ``Freaks and Geeks,'' Linda Cardellini plays Lindsay Weir,
whose secure life is jolted by the death of her grandmother.
College and career now seem insignificant, and she's being driven
away from her old ``brainy'' clique into the lives of the
``freaks,'' a band of chain-smoking slackers who spend their days
slumped on school benches cursing the prom, sports and other
high-school traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The slackers could easily be Columbine's so-called trench-coat
mafia, and creator and supervising producer Paul Feig admits that
to ring true, the show must be based in reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything,'' he said, ``it just shows me how necessary a
show like this is now, because to make a high-school show and not
show the cliques, and not show that there is labeling in the school
is to literally stick your head in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``And once again, it goes back to what kids want to see; they
won't see a bunch of the most beautiful people in the school
dealing with their problems of who's sleeping with whom. They're
going to watch and say, `Oh, my God, that's me. That's my group.'
''
</P>
<P>
   ``Manchester Prep'' is based on the movie ``Cruel Intentions,''
which was inspired by the novel ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' in which
sex was used as a means of manipulation and greed. A writer for the
series said that the writers had been given a mandate to stay away
from violence, but that everything else was fair game.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she'd had a difficult time in high school, the writer,
Erin Maher, said, ``Are you kidding me? High school was `hell.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Which suggests that these shows can serve as a kind of revenge
of the nerds. Talks with producers of the new series reveal that
almost all considered themselves ``geeks'' in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a writer, you go, `I'm going to right the wrongs of when I
was a kid in school,' '' said Feig of ``Freaks and Geeks.'' ``So
you write with the feeling that if you knew then what you know now,
you would have ruled. You can now snap your finger and make the
other kids look dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean this show will rethink America's schools of hard
knocks, letting the freaks and geeks and nerds win, giving viewers
from those groups a reason for encouragement?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, let's just say that we're not doing `Dawson's Creek,'
where everyone is gorgeous and talks like 30-year-olds,'' said
Feig. ``We want our kids more verbal, more real, and we want them
to be the kids who were always ignored. Will we help or hinder?
Either way, we're at least setting ourselves apart and taking
risks. Isn't that what it's about?''

HEART TURNS DOWN THE VOLUME FOR SUMMER TOUR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Right now, Ann and Nancy Wilson could be part of one of those
classic-rock-bands-team-up package deals that are the bread and
butter of the summer concert season.
</P>
<P>
   They could be teaming with, say, Cheap Trick, Foreigner, Styx,
REO Speedwagon, Steve Miller or Journey (or any combination
thereof) and playing a best-of-Heart set to thousands of sunburned,
beer-drinking nostalgia-starved baby boomers. It'd be no problem,
really: Go out there, turn up the amps, play an hour or so, and
walk away with a large paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   But that, says Ann Wilson, now 48, would do nothing artistically
for her and her younger sister, Nancy. Such a tour would be nothing
more than the two of them becoming human jukeboxes for a couple of
months.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Wilson sisters are spending the summer in clubs and
theaters armed with nothing but some acoustic instruments and a
host of songs _ old and new _ they really want to play, the way
they really want to play them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing against the bands that do those tours _ they're
buying new houses and sailboats,'' Ann Wilson says with a laugh.
``The offers are so huge. But Nancy and I aren't there in our
minds.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The small-scale acoustic format ``is just the best. We've found
ourselves the best possible situation. We talk about our songs and
laugh and play the songs. We get to show ourselves as artists. And
it's so much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially dubbed ``An Acoustic Evening With Ann and Nancy
Wilson,'' the tour has been going about six weeks. The Wilson
sisters took their music down to this scale to keep it ``fresh,''
Ann says, and because they wanted a change from the big places
where they had played.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in Seattle in 1974, Heart released its first LP,
``Dreamboat Annie,'' the next year; in 1977 they broke nationally
with ``Crazy on You,'' ``Kick It Out'' and the very Led Zeppelinish
``Barracuda,'' all from the multiplatinum ``Little Queen.'' And for
years after that, it was big sales and big arenas. Which started
out fun but ultimately became a grind, Wilson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about all we've done until the early '90s,'' she says.
``And it was so numbing. We had to work the real estate, as they
say, jumping around and running and stuff to keep the people in the
back rows interested. For teens and rap people that's appropriate,
but as people get older they want more.''
</P>
<P>
   For this tour, the sisters rearranged their best-known songs for
the acoustic format. Some songs, she said, just wouldn't make the
transition from electric to acoustic, but for many others it was
``an easy slide.'' ``Barracuda'' and ``Crazy on You,'' she says,
are now performed with one acoustic guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ```Barracuda' is shockingly different,'' she says. ``But it
works. And now I don't have to scream out those angst-ridden lyrics
like I used to.''
</P>
<P>
   But new, unrecorded material makes up about one-fourth of the
current live set, Wilson says.
</P>
<P>
   One of her favorites at the moment is ``She Still Believes,''
which she says is a true story about a friend who is ``in love with
a man who is completely Mr. Wrong. For seven or eight years she's
been going through this abusive, angry but highly sexual
relationship, and it's tearing her up, but she just keeps hanging
on.''
</P>
<P>
   She's also very fond of a new song called ``Nothing but Love,''
which the sisters wrote with Burt Bacharach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just bold and called him up,'' she says. ``We thought,
`How great it would be to set his lyrics to music and get a great
synthesis of old and new like he got with Elvis Costello.' It's a
very simple song about taking a walk during the day in a city and
seeing love around you and going home alone. It's very cool.''

</P>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A Palestinian apparently on a suicide mission plowed
his car twice into a group of Israeli soldiers early Tuesday,
injuring 11 of them before being shot dead by an Israeli policeman.
</P>
<P>
   The attack, in the town of Beit Shemesh, halfway between
Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, came a week after two Jewish settlers in
the West Bank city of Hebron were lightly injured in a drive-by
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the attacks may signal renewal of armed actions by
militant Palestinian groups opposed to peace with Israel, whose new
prime minister, Ehud Barak, has vowed to step up peace efforts with
the Palestinians and Syria. Hamas, the largest such group, called
in July for such a renewal. But it has not claimed responsibility
for either attack and they may well have been uncoordinated,
freelance actions.
</P>
<P>
   Tension was also raised early Tuesday when the Israeli police
sealed a new opening in the outer wall of Al Aksa, the mosque
compound on the ancient man-made plateau above the Western Wall.
Muslim authorities, who had cleared and widened a window in the
wall earlier in the week, said they were renovating the building.
Israeli officials said they suspected that the Muslims were taking
the first step in creating a new entry to the mosque, which would
violate the two sides' agreements on the holy site.
</P>
<P>
   Fears that the Israeli action would lead to demonstrations or
violence prompted the Israelis to increase security around the
mosque and the Old City of Jerusalem but no trouble occurred.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Israeli and Palestinian officials continued
their negotiations on how to proceed with the next phases of their
land-for-security agreement. Representatives of both sides
refrained from harsh statements about both the attack on the
soldiers and the renovation dispute, indicating that relations at
the official level remained steady.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy held talks with
King Abdullah of Jordan in Amman on Tuesday and urged Syria to come
to the negotiating table, saying the time is ripe for Middle East
peace.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tuesday's attack in Beit Shemesh occurred during the morning
rush hour, when soldiers gather at hitch-hiking posts. The
assailant, Akram Alqam, 22, from the West Bank town of Bethlehem,
had no known ties to Hamas or any other group. Palestinian security
officials said he was released six months ago after a year in jail
for car theft and drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Fadwa, told The Associated Press that her had son
called her on a cell phone and told her he was going to carry out a
suicide attack. She said that while he had no known ties to Hamas
or any other group, he had spent the past week reading a biography
of Yehya Ayyash, a Hamas bomb maker killed by the Israelis in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses and army officials said Alqam's red Fiat Uno hit two
soldiers and kept on going. Police were called and a chase ensued.
About 10 minutes later, the car returned to the scene traveling
very quickly. It hit more soldiers and crashed into the truck after
a policeman shot Alqam. Most of the soldiers were lightly hurt but
one was in serious condition with a head injury and two others were
also hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   While Israeli security officials said they were surprised that
no group had claimed responsibility for the attack, the chief of
the army's home front command, Maj. Gen. Gabi Ofir, did not
hesitate to call what happened ``an Arab terrorist attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak and other senior Israeli officials refrained from publicly
pointing their fingers at the Palestinian Authority for not doing
enough to stop such attacks. But security officials, speaking on
the condition of anonymity, said recently that such attacks are
rarely spontaneous.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are either organized or the product of incitement by the
Palestinian leadership,'' one top military official said last week
after the Hebron shooting. ``The Palestinian Authority behaves like
someone who doesn't want to see stability on the ground and can
create instability in many matters.''
</P>
<P>
   In late July, a leaflet was circulated by Hamas threatening to
renew strikes against Israel after a relatively quiet period of
several months. The flyer said, ``The public will be happy to hear
in the near future good news about our Jihad,'' using the Arabic
word for struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Palestinian Authority as the ``autonomous
entity,'' it added, ``The Zionists and their American allies,
together with the autonomous entity intend to destroy the Hamas
leadership. Hamas will not neglect the path of Jihad, whatever
victims it leaves behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamas' support among Palestinians has declined steadily since
Yasser Arafat returned to Gaza in 1994, and now stands at about 20
percent of the population. Israeli security officials say that
whenever peace prospects improve the risk of attacks goes up.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Picnics _ designed for enjoying a beautiful day or
evening outdoors _ are all a matter of style. They can range from
humble spur-of-the-moment outings to more elegant affairs geared to
enjoy an evening at a concert under the stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the virtues of a picnic is its flexibility,'' writes
Barbara Scott-Goodman in her new book, ``Picnics'' (Chronicle
Books; $12.95). ``A picnic can be held almost anywhere: at the
beach in the late afternoon, in the woods during a hike, on a boat
at the lake, on the roadside while traveling with the family, in
the park before a concert. Closer to home, a picnic can be casual,
under a tree in the back yard, or on the deck or patio, or it can
be formal, such as an alfresco dinner on the terrace with
candlelight.''
</P>
<P>
   Planning an impromptu picnic can take a few quick minutes to
hastily grab a blanket or towel, load the cooler with a few
sandwiches prepared from on-hand pantry or refrigerator
ingredients, potato chips, paper plates and cans of your favorite
beverages and head for the park or beach. Or when there's more
time, organizers can plan in advance and coordinate the seasonal
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Composing a picnic involves creating a harmonious mixture of
foods with complementary flavors and textures. Numerous
configurations are feasible, depending on your schedule and the
preparation time available to coordinate your efforts. Peruse the
recipes that follow _ and mix and match to personalize your picnic
menu.
</P>
<P>
   Remember to suit food selections to the venue and the people who
will be going on the picnic. Children find the simplest foods
appealing _ and you don't have to impress them. Peanut butter and
jelly sandwiches will do.
</P>
<P>
   When you're looking for something quick, consider filling a
baguette with slices of brie or buffalo mozzarella cheese, fresh
basil and garden-fresh tomato slices. Top with a drizzle of
pesto-flavored olive oil, wrap in foil and tote with a sharp knife.
</P>
<P>
   Leftover chicken can be turned into a wonderful chicken salad or
just layered in pita bread with roasted red peppers, basil, cheese
slices and olive tapenade (either prepared or homemade). You can
also roll up thinly sliced roast beef or cooked turkey with a sour
cream and horseradish mixture, chopped green onions and tomatoes in
sheets of lavosh (available in the bread section of supermarkets)
for a fast portable feast.
</P>
<P>
   An antipasto platter is another fast idea that you can rustle up
in a jiffy with jars of olives, roasted red peppers, marinated
artichoke hearts and mushrooms, slices of buffalo or other
mozzarella cheese or provolone, salami and mortadella slices along
with fresh basil and a drizzle of olive oil and vinegar, if
desired. Accompany with slices of rustic Italian or olive bread _
and the feast is on.
</P>
<P>
   Some tips for picnickers:
</P>
<P>
   _ Plan ahead and make a list to avoid forgetting anything
crucial like plates, utensils, napkins, can opener, etc. Check off
the list before departing.
</P>
<P>
   _ While beautiful picnic baskets are nice, they're not
mandatory. Coolers, and canvas and straw bags of all sizes work
well, too. Check out the colorful and sturdy acrylic and plastic
plates and utensils _ from places like Target, Kmart,
Bloomingdale's and Crate &AMP; Barrel _ which can jazz up the
festivities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Select food items that travel well. Avoid saucy or drippy
items or desserts like custards or creme brulees. Instead opt for
cookies or a pan-baked cake. Assorted individual fresh fruits _ be
sure they are rinsed in advance _ are good choices.
</P>
<P>
   _ To keep the picnic interesting and fun, opt for a couple of
creative or novel dishes _ or classic favorites with new twists.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't feel obligated to spend hours in the kitchen preparing a
feast. Supermarket delis and neighborhood takeout places with a
variety of ethnic choices are happy to supply you with innovative
and tasty fare. See the accompany list for some possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Or when the picnic mood strikes and there's no time to cook,
you can create a spur-of-the-moment feast by picking up a selection
of cheese wedges, pates, cooked meats, bread, fruit, wine, even a
bar of chocolate and cookies to pack in your basket.
</P>
<P>
   _ For ease and convenience and to avoid a messy hassle at the
site, do as much in advance as possible before toting the food. For
instance, butter bread and rolls before leaving home. If possible,
toss vegetable salads with dressing just before heading out the
door. If planning to serve items like chicken or other salads on
greens, take advantage of the many cleaned bagged salad mixes on
the market and open them just before serving on location.
</P>
<P>
   _ Select the picnic site before leaving home to save time and
assist in planning. If you're going to the beach, towels, folding
chairs, toys for playing in the sand, etc. make sense. The park may
dictate blankets, folding chairs (unless picnic tables and chairs
are available there), a plastic table cloth, balls, Frisbees, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _ Once you arrive at the site, survey the area and look for a
level spot free of tree roots or holes to lay out your blanket and
picnic. Consider locating near trees so you'll have some shade.
Pick a spot where you can view a large area, particularly if you
are taking children.
</P>
<P>
   _ To prevent moisture from seeping through your blanket on the
ground, bring a large piece of plastic or a tarp to put underneath.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pack cold foods with other cold foods to keep them cool en
route to the picnic. The same goes for hot foods _ do not pack cold
and hot foods in the same cooler or picnic basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be too careful when handling and packing food for
cooking and eating outdoors,'' notes Scott-Goodman. Summer heat
increases the chance of bacterial growth in foods, especially those
that are high in protein and moisture _ including meats, poultry,
seafood, dairy products and eggs _ she points out.
</P>
<P>
   So heed food-safety basics, including washing your hands before
and after food handling and cleaning cutting surfaces and utensils
with hot soapy water after each use.
</P>
<P>
   Keep all foods prepared ahead of time refrigerated. Just before
leaving for your picnic destination, pack cold foods in a cooler
surrounded by ice or frozen gel packs. Transport them to the picnic
site in the air-conditioned passenger compartment of the car,
rather than in the hot trunk, if at all possible.
</P>
<P>
   Wrap any hot foods in heavy-duty foil or several thicknesses of
newspapers, then in towels before packing snugly in a basket or
heat-reflective carrier to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rely on thermoses _ available in various sizes from pints to
gallons _ to retain the temperature of hot or cold drinks or soup.
</P>
<P>
   _ Once at the picnic site, store your basket or cooler(s) in a
shady place, not in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   _ Unwrap and put foods out just prior to serving. Also be sure
to promptly store any leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   _ If friends volunteer to bring something to the picnic, by all
means encourage them. Just coordinate their efforts so you don't
end up with three potato salads _ and no coleslaw or macaroni salad
_ or two chocolate cakes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't forget to take clean-up items like garbage bags, paper
towels, wet wipes and food storage bags.
</P>
<P>
   _ For fun, explore the glory of a summer breakfast picnic.
Gather everything the night before, or get up early and stop on
your way to the site for the fixings _ fresh fruit, orange juice,
coffeecake, bagels, cream cheese, lox and even coffee. There's
something magical about dining in the fresh air and celebrating
life _ and there's no better way to start the day!
</P>
<P>
   Remember when it comes to picnics, ingenuity is the key. Make
the fare as simple or elaborate as your schedule permits _ and then
enjoy dining alfresco. &QL;

MEDIA DO US NO FAVORS BY HANDICAPPING BUSH'S COMPETITORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ASHLEY CHESHIRE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has it occurred to you yet that the national media are helping
George W. Bush stampede the Republican presidential nomination
process?
</P>
<P>
   That, undoubtedly, is ``not'' the media's intention, but that
certainly is its effect. The Bush campaign clearly understands
media tendencies and is working them for all they're worth, at
least the part that deals with national election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   They know that reporters are going to cover politics as if they
were covering horse races or baseball teams. They may all be
frustrated sportswriters, longing for those neat handicapping
charts, box scores and league standings. Nobody does those things
better than the sports department.
</P>
<P>
   But since they take elections to be horse races, reporters
naturally pay more attention to the perceived leader, the one with
no mud on his face.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else is relegated to also-ran, even if the race is
still running. Only when someone makes a serious charge from back
in the pack can he or she get more than the minimum ink and air
time.
</P>
<P>
   Surely nobody likes a system that works like that. It's such a
mean, narrow, shortsighted approach to a subject that we all agree
is important. But I'm sure you know this by now.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign knows this, too. So they knew how the media
would respond when they announced that the governor had raised $37
million in campaign funds. It was by far more money than any other
candidate had raised to that point. And since no actual votes had
been cast, and the polls had been done to death, the campaign media
grabbed the money and ran.
</P>
<P>
   It was news, but they made it BIG NEWS. Suddenly Bush is
unstoppable. Bush has this race won.
</P>
<P>
   The best example of this was a recent illustration in an East
Coast paper showing a gigantic pair of black ostrich cowboy boots,
putatively the governor's. Lilliputian figures of the other
candidates were perched on his instep, peering out from the cuffs
of his suit pants, insignificant and ineffectual, struggling to
explain why they were still around.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, Bush had gone from ``attractive likely candidate'' to
``turn out the lights, the party's over.'' But, you know, they're
still going to play the rest of the baseball season even though the
Texas Rangers have a commanding lead in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, front-runner is an enviable position for the
governor, but you still have to ask yourself why they would do
this.
</P>
<P>
   Why would the Bush camp risk making big money an issue at a time
when campaign financing is one of the country's most serious
maladies? It's not going away. It's like an unlanced boil, growing
there just under the skin. It's going to burst one day. It could
redefine this election. Why would Bush risk becoming identified
with the excesses of such an insidious system?
</P>
<P>
   Well, I figure it this way:
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you think about his politics, the governor's a pretty
cool guy in public. People like him. They like his wife and
daughters and his dad. They like the heck out of his mother. Face
it, we'd elect Barb to the presidency, but she's too smart to run.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor ... well, he's largely undefined. True, he's
running in a comparatively weak field, and no one has his overall
appeal. But each of his competitors has strengths that he can't
match.
</P>
<P>
   He can't match Elizabeth Dole's exemplary record of public
service.
</P>
<P>
   He can't match Sen. John McCain's war record and passion for
government.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the coup counted with the Texas Rangers, he can't even
match Steve Forbes' personal wealth, or even his business
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The longer Bush lets these folks hang around, the more likely
one or more of them will get legs and turn into a real problem.
Better to whack 'em while the whacking is good and show that none
has a real chance. Good things happen when you do that. For one
thing, people quit giving them money and give it to you instead.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is, they're gonna run this race anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And the political reporters could do us all a favor by pushing
the governor to define himself in terms of issues that the average
American cares about.
</P>
<P>
   They could do that for all the candidates instead of treating us
to daily reports of a horse race, without so much as a how-they-ran
box.

RUSSIAN KIDS COME TO U.S. HOMES WHERE LOVE IS THE FIRST LANGUAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia _ ``Papa, papa, papa,'' says Alexey, 6,
hanging on to the man who just became his father: Lamont Crogh.
</P>
<P>
   Crogh is a shop foreman at a lumber mill, and lives in New
Meadows, Idaho. He had never been in the Russian Far East or, for
that matter, outside of North America. ``I don't really like
getting out of the United States,'' he says. ``I wouldn't have done
it for anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Croghs and a group of Americans are celebrating their new
families in a Chinese restaurant. The food is only so-so, and the
music, a raucous Russian disco, is punctuated by an occasional car
alarm from out in the street. But these Americans don't care.
They're celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Crogh, who works as a physical therapist, looks at the
boy's wobbly gait. ``He's a bit weak,'' she says. ``I think he
needs to run around.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Idaho, the Croghs have 12 acres including woods, an
Australian shepherd dog and a pond full of fish. ``It's a great
place for boys,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Alexey, who knows nothing of this, is basking in the excitement
of this big-city restaurant. He wants to get all the attention he
can from his new dad. And he's not the only one: The Croghs also
have just adopted a 1-year-old, Benjamin, so Alexey will have a
brother.
</P>
<P>
   These children are coming from a world of poverty. They take
nothing when they leave. ``You return the clothes, even the
underwear,'' says Connie Crogh.
</P>
<P>
   But the parents have only good words for the Russians they have
met. The orphanages they saw did not mistreat or grossly neglect
the children, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamont Crogh was still thinking about the director of Alexey's
orphanage making just $50 per month.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people here are trying so hard,'' he says. ``It just
makes you appreciate what you've got.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents have arranged their adoptions through a Seattle
agency, the World Association for Children and Parents. Barbara
Knowles, assistant director, says the agency has found parents for
7,000 children since 1975, and has helped with feeding programs for
hundreds of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The Croghs got their children in about six months. ``Families
that apply to adopt a boy child, or an older child, or a child with
special needs, will wait the shortest amount of time,'' Knowles
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilson family applied to adopt all three types. On this day,
Taylor and Jennifer Wilson of American Fork, Utah, have adopted
three children: Ekaterina, 7, her brother Dmitry, 6, and Maxim, 10
months. Maxim, not related to the other two, has a cleft palate, a
birth defect that would not be fixed in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilsons are a child-oriented family: they have five of their
own. Taylor and Jennifer both work at home, he for a 3-D graphics
company and she as a homemaker. They decided at Christmas that they
would adopt from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer, who has relatives who came to Russia as Mormon
missionaries, says, ``When we heard about the conditions the kids
lived in, it really touched our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   The two older kids, nicknamed Katya and Dima, are finishing
their food and have already learned their first English: ``More,
please'' and ``Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Katya cleans her plate a second time, and Taylor spoons more
food. He says to Jennifer, ``We need to stop asking if they want it
and just give it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinner finished, the parents and kids go outside for group
photos. Nearby, three uniformed soldiers watch curiously, spitting
the shells of watermelon seeds.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Vladivostok seems a dream. Back in Utah, Katya
and Dima ``have learned how to get along with the family,'' says
Taylor Wilson. The most difficult time, he says, was in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Each has made a special friend with the Wilson child closest to
his age. ``You can tell that once the language barrier is gone, it
will be just as if they were born into the family,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilsons have made friends with a couple who speak Russian,
in hopes that Katya and Dima have someone to speak Russian with.
Already they're mixing in words and phrases from English. It is
likely that they will lose their Russian entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The baby, Maxim, ``had a hard time figuring out that being held
is a good thing,'' Taylor Wilson says. He is getting used to it;
and on July 30 he went in for surgery to mend his lip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went great,'' says Taylor Wilson. ``He's able to say things
like, `Mama, Mama,' by putting his lips together that he couldn't
do before.'' Surgeons will close the hole in the palate in about
two months.
</P>
<P>
   In Idaho, Alex is squirting water at the dog _ a big step for
him. ``He was panic-stricken when he first saw the dog,'' Connie
Crogh says. ``He was climbing up on the table. He thought his life
was over.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy had never had any experience with pet dogs, or any
similar animals.
</P>
<P>
   Nor with a supermarket. ``Every step it's, `Mama, mama. Look at
this!''' Crogh says. ``He sees a bag of carrots, and he says,
`Ohhhh.'''
</P>
<P>
   Alex won't eat much bread or meat. ``He will inhale any fresh
vegetable or fruit. He likes ice cream,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And as for the wobbly gait, she says, ``That's improving,
definitely. He's getting some muscles in his legs.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his behavior, she says, ``He has tried a few little
naughty things just to see what we'd do, but he backs down right
away. He aims to please.''
</P>
<P>
   And she is pleased. ``I'm having a blast,'' she says. Her
biggest worry is going back to work after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   But, she says, ``It's only half time.''
</P>

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Four scientists wearing coveralls and hard hats shuffle warily
into a steel cage the size of a closet, cramming themselves against
a dozen miners.
</P>
<P>
   The doors clang shut, and the group plunges hundreds of stories
down into the darkness _ No. 5 Shaft in South Africa's East
Driefontein gold mine. The goal: to find living microbes living
deep in the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Within moments the air becomes oppressively hot. This is one of
the farthest-reaching excavations in the world, burrowing more than
two miles toward the center of Earth.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the mine, radioactivity and heat from the
planet's core raise the temperature of the stone in the tunnels to
a searing 120 F, and the atmospheric pressure is double that on the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen rarely exists naturally so far underground, and only a
constant rush of forced air from the surface disperses poisonous
methane and hydrogen seeping from the rock. Pumped-in jets of water
help keep workers from slowly cooking to death.
</P>
<P>
   Geologist T.C. Onstott, a Princeton professor, pulls a water
bottle from his knapsack and takes a swig. To him, the heat and
claustrophobia are merely aggravation. Real worry for the team of
scientists, as well as the miners, centers on ``seismic events'' _
high-pressure cave-ins that kill.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to obtain samples from wells that have not been
contaminated by air or water from the surface. Onstott decided he
had to find a way to visit the microbes himself. The mine he chose
to explore is part of a sprawling manmade underworld started on a
Sunday morning in 1886 when an Australian prospector found a
gold-rich outcrop on the present site of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Like a nose peeping out of the covers, that outcrop was just the
start. Since then, three-quarters of the gold ever mined has come
out of the region. The most recent shaft at East Driefontein took
15 years to excavate _ and that was just the vertical hole.
</P>
<P>
   For his journey into this biosphere, Onstott rounded up an
all-star crew of microbiologists. They included: Bill Ghiorse, who
led Environmental Protection Agency research into subsurface
bacteria that eat toxic waste; Duane Moser, a lab wizard and avid
spelunker; Svetlana Kotelnikova, a Russian scientist working in
Sweden; Mary DeFlaun of Envirogen, an environmental technology
firm; and Jim Fredrickson, who has isolated many deep-bacteria
cultures while working at the Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   At East Driefontein, Onstott and his team would spend three
months gathering samples at a depth where no microbe hunters had
ventured before: The No. 5 Shaft bottoms out at 11,222 feet.
</P>
<P>
   On this scouting mission, the elevator slowly comes to a halt at
6,120 feet and the researchers walk through a short tunnel to a
second elevator that takes them to the mine's deepest diggings. At
the bottom, the group boards a miniature train for a half-mile ride
through the dark as a giant air pipe roars overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The train stops at a dark hole in the wall: the stope, or mining
face. The passage dips down at a steep angle; in many sections the
ceiling is only three feet high.
</P>
<P>
   The stope swarms with miners. Drills, saws and jackhammers roar
so loudly that hand signals must be used. Amid the pandemonium, the
scientists find their objective: a black coal-like vein interwoven
with round stones and sparkly filaments.
</P>
<P>
   This mineral-rich seam is dubbed the carbon leader. Often no
more than a finger wide, sandwiched in a mass of ancient quartzite,
the carbon leader is heavily laced with uranium and holds an
extraordinary concentration of gold.
</P>
<P>
   No one is certain how the carbon leader formed. It could be the
remains of either algae that settled on an ancient sea bottom or
oil that shot through a crack underground. In any case, the rock
formation is loaded with carbon compounds potentially nutritious to
microbes.
</P>
<P>
   Strong evidence that microbes could survive in an even more
austere environment was uncovered in 1995, when a team working at
the Department of Energy's Hanford Reservation in Washington found
rock-eating organisms that get their sustenance from elemental
mineral energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   The microbes were taken from groundwater sitting in igneous
basalt 4,500 feet down. In a series of lab experiments,
microbiologist Todd Stevens of Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory showed that basalt may react with groundwater to release
hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
   The microbes combine the hydrogen with carbon dioxide in the
water to make organic compounds. Their main waste product is
methane _ a natural gas long thought to be formed mainly near the
surface by swamp-dwelling microbes, and in the depths of Earth by
nonbiological chemical reactions.
</P>
<P>
   But eating is only half the equation. Like us, many bacteria
must respire _ combine food with some other substance to release
energy. Our respiratory agent is oxygen, a byproduct of plant
photosynthesis.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen is rare below ground, where microbiologists have found
organisms that breathe an astounding variety of alternatives:
ferric iron, sulfate, nitrate, nitrite, uranium and carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   In rocks Onstott gathered on a 1996 visit to another South
African mine, microbiologists Jim Fredrickson and Tom Kieft
discovered a heat-resistant bacterium that inhales iron, nitrate,
manganese, sulfur, chromium, cobalt and oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   At East Driefontein, Onstott planned to gather more samples to
test a hypothesis that some deep bacteria extract energy from
elements released as byproducts of the natural radioactivity of the
rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, crouched before the carbon leader, he reaches out and
touches the seam with a Geiger counter.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a drill starts up somewhere, shaking the place like an
earthquake. Rock fragments bounce off helmets. The group of
researchers moves on, looking for a safer spot.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred feet down, they come upon a newly blasted section
of tunnel where miners are shoving steel hydraulic jacks called
rock props against the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good!'' Onstott hollers. ``Means it's fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Moser pulls out a ball peen hammer and a sterilized chisel and
pounds at the crumbly ore. When he is done, Onstott _ with precious
samples in hand _ and his fellow scientists finally smile. They
climb slowly down the stope to another railroad tunnel and begin
hiking out.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Onstott's team were in for a surprise: Some stones
appeared to house between 100,000 and 1 million microbes per gram.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's 100 times what we expected,'' Onstott says.
</P>
<P>
   The team's trove also included mine-water samples containing

<P>
   Four scientists wearing coveralls and hard hats shuffle warily
into a steel cage the size of a closet, cramming themselves against
a dozen miners.
</P>
<P>
   The doors clang shut, and the group plunges hundreds of stories
down into the darkness _ No. 5 Shaft in South Africa's East
Driefontein gold mine. The goal: to find living microbes living
deep in the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Within moments the air becomes oppressively hot. This is one of
the farthest-reaching excavations in the world, burrowing more than
two miles toward the center of Earth.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the mine, radioactivity and heat from the
planet's core raise the temperature of the stone in the tunnels to
a searing 120 F, and the atmospheric pressure is double that on the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen rarely exists naturally so far underground, and only a
constant rush of forced air from the surface disperses poisonous
methane and hydrogen seeping from the rock. Pumped-in jets of water
help keep workers from slowly cooking to death.
</P>
<P>
   Geologist T.C. Onstott, a Princeton professor, pulls a water
bottle from his knapsack and takes a swig. To him, the heat and
claustrophobia are merely aggravation. Real worry for the team of
scientists, as well as the miners, centers on ``seismic events'' _
high-pressure cave-ins that kill.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to obtain samples from wells that have not been
contaminated by air or water from the surface. Onstott decided he
had to find a way to visit the microbes himself. The mine he chose
to explore is part of a sprawling manmade underworld started on a
Sunday morning in 1886 when an Australian prospector found a
gold-rich outcrop on the present site of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Like a nose peeping out of the covers, that outcrop was just the
start. Since then, three-quarters of the gold ever mined has come
out of the region. The most recent shaft at East Driefontein took
15 years to excavate _ and that was just the vertical hole.
</P>
<P>
   For his journey into this biosphere, Onstott rounded up an
all-star crew of microbiologists. They included: Bill Ghiorse, who
led Environmental Protection Agency research into subsurface
bacteria that eat toxic waste; Duane Moser, a lab wizard and avid
spelunker; Svetlana Kotelnikova, a Russian scientist working in
Sweden; Mary DeFlaun of Envirogen, an environmental technology
firm; and Jim Fredrickson, who has isolated many deep-bacteria
cultures while working at the Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   At East Driefontein, Onstott and his team would spend three
months gathering samples at a depth where no microbe hunters had
ventured before: The No. 5 Shaft bottoms out at 11,222 feet.
</P>
<P>
   On this scouting mission, the elevator slowly comes to a halt at
6,120 feet and the researchers walk through a short tunnel to a
second elevator that takes them to the mine's deepest diggings. At
the bottom, the group boards a miniature train for a half-mile ride
through the dark as a giant air pipe roars overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The train stops at a dark hole in the wall: the stope, or mining
face. The passage dips down at a steep angle; in many sections the
ceiling is only three feet high.
</P>
<P>
   The stope swarms with miners. Drills, saws and jackhammers roar
so loudly that hand signals must be used. Amid the pandemonium, the
scientists find their objective: a black coal-like vein interwoven
with round stones and sparkly filaments.
</P>
<P>
   This mineral-rich seam is dubbed the carbon leader. Often no
more than a finger wide, sandwiched in a mass of ancient quartzite,
the carbon leader is heavily laced with uranium and holds an
extraordinary concentration of gold.
</P>
<P>
   No one is certain how the carbon leader formed. It could be the
remains of either algae that settled on an ancient sea bottom or
oil that shot through a crack underground. In any case, the rock
formation is loaded with carbon compounds potentially nutritious to
microbes.
</P>
<P>
   Strong evidence that microbes could survive in an even more
austere environment was uncovered in 1995, when a team working at
the Department of Energy's Hanford Reservation in Washington found
rock-eating organisms that get their sustenance from elemental
mineral energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   The microbes were taken from groundwater sitting in igneous
basalt 4,500 feet down. In a series of lab experiments,
microbiologist Todd Stevens of Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory showed that basalt may react with groundwater to release
hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
   The microbes combine the hydrogen with carbon dioxide in the
water to make organic compounds. Their main waste product is
methane _ a natural gas long thought to be formed mainly near the
surface by swamp-dwelling microbes, and in the depths of Earth by
nonbiological chemical reactions.
</P>
<P>
   But eating is only half the equation. Like us, many bacteria
must respire _ combine food with some other substance to release
energy. Our respiratory agent is oxygen, a byproduct of plant
photosynthesis.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen is rare below ground, where microbiologists have found
organisms that breathe an astounding variety of alternatives:
ferric iron, sulfate, nitrate, nitrite, uranium and carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   In rocks Onstott gathered on a 1996 visit to another South
African mine, microbiologists Jim Fredrickson and Tom Kieft
discovered a heat-resistant bacterium that inhales iron, nitrate,
manganese, sulfur, chromium, cobalt and oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   At East Driefontein, Onstott planned to gather more samples to
test a hypothesis that some deep bacteria extract energy from
elements released as byproducts of the natural radioactivity of the
rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, crouched before the carbon leader, he reaches out and
touches the seam with a Geiger counter.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a drill starts up somewhere, shaking the place like an
earthquake. Rock fragments bounce off helmets. The group of
researchers moves on, looking for a safer spot.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred feet down, they come upon a newly blasted section
of tunnel where miners are shoving steel hydraulic jacks called
rock props against the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good!'' Onstott hollers. ``Means it's fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Moser pulls out a ball peen hammer and a sterilized chisel and
pounds at the crumbly ore. When he is done, Onstott _ with precious
samples in hand _ and his fellow scientists finally smile. They
climb slowly down the stope to another railroad tunnel and begin
hiking out.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Onstott's team were in for a surprise: Some stones
appeared to house between 100,000 and 1 million microbes per gram.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's 100 times what we expected,'' Onstott says.
</P>
<P>
   The team's trove also included mine-water samples containing
rod-shaped microbes six times the size of many surface microbes.
Some of the bugs breathe iron; some live on methane. Others might
eat hydrogen freed when radiation breaks down water molecules.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists even speculate that some of the deep microbes may
have deposited the filigree of gold in the East Driefontein mine.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   The water is warm and deep and clear. Four scuba divers splash
in, signal the go-ahead, and then slip below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   As they drift down, the sunlight transforms the bright hues of
their gear into a moving palette. Then the swimmers are lost from
sight.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a scene from ``Sea Hunt'' _ except that the divers
have plunged into a bottomless hole in the heart of the Mojave
Desert, more than 200 miles from the nearest ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion is the semiannual pupfish count in Ash Meadows,
Nev., a 24,000-acre oasis of clay dunes, spring-fed pools, and
plants and animals found nowhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
   On this morning in late March, representatives of the National
Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Nevada
Division of Wildlife have gathered to assay the fortunes of an
animal that lives here, in what is perhaps the most restricted and
isolated environment occupied by any fish anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   That environment is Devils Hole, a limestone cave filled
year-round with warm water that flows up from an underground
aquifer.
</P>
<P>
   It's the pupfish that draw the divers and their retinue twice
yearly. To the untrained eye, the Devils Hole pupfish, Cyprinodon
diabolis, is an unremarkable creature: It looks like a stout, steel
blu minnow.
</P>
<P>
   To knowledgeable observers, the fish is a prime example of
evolution _ and possibly extinction _ in action.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 10,000 years, the Devils Hole pupfish has adapted
to increasingly extreme conditions as post-Ice Age climate changes
have shrunk its habitat from a sizable lake to the ecological
equivalent of a kiddie pool.
</P>
<P>
   With their thermal sources and arid environs, desert springs
have some of the highest temperatures, greatest salt concentrations
and lowest oxygen contents of any fish habitat.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils Hole pupfish and other pupfish species that were
stranded in the Mojave by receding waters have developed unique
physiological mechanisms to cope with these pressures.
</P>
<P>
   But pupfish still need water, however salty, stagnant or hot.
And for the Devils Hole pupfish, that resource has been further
threatened since the late 1960s, when pumping from nearby springs
for farm irrigation began to deplete the underground water supply
that feeds the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that C. diabolis is classified as an
endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, after a contest pitting developers and state
supremacists against federal statutes and conservationists, the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled that protecting the pupfish from an
unnatural extinction also meant protecting its home. In particular,
the court ruled that water levels in Devils Hole must be kept high
enough to top an algae-covered rock shelf at the mouth of the cave
where the fish do most of their feeding and spawning.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the ruling, development in the area was halted,
and in 1984 the Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge was
established.
</P>
<P>
   Desert-fish advocates have long felt the need to keep tabs on
the imperiled pupfish population itself. Scuba-diving biologist
Stan Hillyard of the University of Nevada at Las Vegas has been
counting pupfish for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   This year, as in most others, he accompanies his fellow divers
about 80 feet down the hole, to a flat shelf called Anvil Rock,
then begins a slow ascent.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing each other up a staircase of ledges that can't be seen
from the surface, Hillyard and a colleague use waterproof tablets
to tally the fish. The other two members of the group are certified
cave divers who watch over the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Devils Hole is a notoriously dangerous place to dive: Despite
expeditions down 400 feet and more by the U.S. Geological Survey,
no one has ever found the bottom of the cave, and at least two
people have died here during recreational dives (which are no
longer permitted). Their bodies were never found.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, safe on dry land, National Park Service biologist
Doug Threloff supervises the surface count. This involves crouching
over the spawning shelf and staring through half a foot of water
and algae to enumerate fish that look exactly like other fish
you've already counted and which, because they refuse to keep
still, may in fact be other fish you've already counted.
</P>
<P>
   It's an imprecise science. When the divers reappear about 40
minutes later, the surface and submarine counts are added for a
total of 196. A second count in the afternoon, using the same
procedures, yields a sum of just 182.
</P>
<P>
   Threloff is troubled by the numbers, which have been low for the
past two years. The population tends to build over the summer as
fry hatch on the shelf, so fall counts are usually higher.
</P>
<P>
   In good years, more than 500 fish have thrived in a Devils Hole
autumn. But it's not clear just how low the spring count can go
without jeopardizing the pupfish's seasonal rebound and long-term
survival.
</P>
<P>
   Directly or indirectly, almost all of the Ash Meadows endemics
rely on fossil water stored in underground basins since the end of
the last Ice Age. The springwater in Devils Hole is known to be at
least 8,000 years old, and Threloff worries that it may never
return to its pre-pumping level.
</P>
<P>
   Farms and mining operations to the north could still be
depleting the Ash Meadows supply, albeit slowly, as they draw more
water than is replaced by the region's meager rain and snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   The most tangible evidence of that depletion would show up at
Devils Hole, where water levels have in fact been dropping again
since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the pupfish is a kind of canary in a coal mine for all the
plants and animals in Ash Meadows. As such, it has a sorry song to
sing.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the fish repeat the trick by which our ancestors crawled
out of the sea and onto land, they could perish along with their
jewel blue pool.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the edge of that pool, with the spring sun hinting
at summer's heat, it's not hard to imagine how the underground
oasis at Devils Hole might one day become a mirage.

   Four scientists wearing coveralls and hard hats shuffle warily
into a steel cage the size of a closet, cramming themselves against
a dozen miners.
</P>
<P>
   The doors clang shut, and the group plunges hundreds of stories
down into the darkness _ No. 5 Shaft in South Africa's East
Driefontein gold mine. The goal: to find living microbes living
deep in the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Within moments the air becomes oppressively hot. This is one of
the farthest-reaching excavations in the world, burrowing more than
two miles toward the center of Earth.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the mine, radioactivity and heat from the
planet's core raise the temperature of the stone in the tunnels to
a searing 120 F, and the atmospheric pressure is double that on the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen rarely exists naturally so far underground, and only a
constant rush of forced air from the surface disperses poisonous
methane and hydrogen seeping from the rock. Pumped-in jets of water
help keep workers from slowly cooking to death.
</P>
<P>
   Geologist T.C. Onstott, a Princeton professor, pulls a water
bottle from his knapsack and takes a swig. To him, the heat and
claustrophobia are merely aggravation. Real worry for the team of
scientists, as well as the miners, centers on ``seismic events'' _
high-pressure cave-ins that kill.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to obtain samples from wells that have not been
contaminated by air or water from the surface. Onstott decided he
had to find a way to visit the microbes himself. The mine he chose
to explore is part of a sprawling manmade underworld started on a
Sunday morning in 1886 when an Australian prospector found a
gold-rich outcrop on the present site of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Like a nose peeping out of the covers, that outcrop was just the
start. Since then, three-quarters of the gold ever mined has come
out of the region. The most recent shaft at East Driefontein took
15 years to excavate _ and that was just the vertical hole.
</P>
<P>
   For his journey into this biosphere, Onstott rounded up an
all-star crew of microbiologists. They included: Bill Ghiorse, who
led Environmental Protection Agency research into subsurface
bacteria that eat toxic waste; Duane Moser, a lab wizard and avid
spelunker; Svetlana Kotelnikova, a Russian scientist working in
Sweden; Mary DeFlaun of Envirogen, an environmental technology
firm; and Jim Fredrickson, who has isolated many deep-bacteria
cultures while working at the Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   At East Driefontein, Onstott and his team would spend three
months gathering samples at a depth where no microbe hunters had
ventured before: The No. 5 Shaft bottoms out at 11,222 feet.
</P>
<P>
   On this scouting mission, the elevator slowly comes to a halt at
6,120 feet and the researchers walk through a short tunnel to a
second elevator that takes them to the mine's deepest diggings. At
the bottom, the group boards a miniature train for a half-mile ride
through the dark as a giant air pipe roars overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The train stops at a dark hole in the wall: the stope, or mining
face. The passage dips down at a steep angle; in many sections the
ceiling is only three feet high.
</P>
<P>
   The stope swarms with miners. Drills, saws and jackhammers roar
so loudly that hand signals must be used. Amid the pandemonium, the
scientists find their objective: a black coal-like vein interwoven
with round stones and sparkly filaments.
</P>
<P>
   This mineral-rich seam is dubbed the carbon leader. Often no
more than a finger wide, sandwiched in a mass of ancient quartzite,
the carbon leader is heavily laced with uranium and holds an
extraordinary concentration of gold.
</P>
<P>
   No one is certain how the carbon leader formed. It could be the
remains of either algae that settled on an ancient sea bottom or
oil that shot through a crack underground. In any case, the rock
formation is loaded with carbon compounds potentially nutritious to
microbes.
</P>
<P>
   Strong evidence that microbes could survive in an even more
austere environment was uncovered in 1995, when a team working at
the Department of Energy's Hanford Reservation in Washington found
rock-eating organisms that get their sustenance from elemental
mineral energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   The microbes were taken from groundwater sitting in igneous
basalt 4,500 feet down. In a series of lab experiments,
microbiologist Todd Stevens of Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory showed that basalt may react with groundwater to release
hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
   The microbes combine the hydrogen with carbon dioxide in the
water to make organic compounds. Their main waste product is
methane _ a natural gas long thought to be formed mainly near the
surface by swamp-dwelling microbes, and in the depths of Earth by
nonbiological chemical reactions.
</P>
<P>
   But eating is only half the equation. Like us, many bacteria
must respire _ combine food with some other substance to release
energy. Our respiratory agent is oxygen, a byproduct of plant
photosynthesis.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen is rare below ground, where microbiologists have found
organisms that breathe an astounding variety of alternatives:
ferric iron, sulfate, nitrate, nitrite, uranium and carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   In rocks Onstott gathered on a 1996 visit to another South
African mine, microbiologists Jim Fredrickson and Tom Kieft
discovered a heat-resistant bacterium that inhales iron, nitrate,
manganese, sulfur, chromium, cobalt and oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   At East Driefontein, Onstott planned to gather more samples to
test a hypothesis that some deep bacteria extract energy from
elements released as byproducts of the natural radioactivity of the
rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, crouched before the carbon leader, he reaches out and
touches the seam with a Geiger counter.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a drill starts up somewhere, shaking the place like an
earthquake. Rock fragments bounce off helmets. The group of
researchers moves on, looking for a safer spot.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred feet down, they come upon a newly blasted section
of tunnel where miners are shoving steel hydraulic jacks called
rock props against the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good!'' Onstott hollers. ``Means it's fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Moser pulls out a ball peen hammer and a sterilized chisel and
pounds at the crumbly ore. When he is done, Onstott _ with precious
samples in hand _ and his fellow scientists finally smile. They
climb slowly down the stope to another railroad tunnel and begin
hiking out.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Onstott's team were in for a surprise: Some stones
appeared to house between 100,000 and 1 million microbes per gram.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's 100 times what we expected,'' Onstott says.
</P>
<P>
   The team's trove also included mine-water samples containing
rod-shaped microbes six times the size of many surface microbes.
Some of the bugs breathe iron; some live on methane. Others might
eat hydrogen freed when radiation breaks down water molecules.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists even speculate that some of the deep microbes may
have deposited the filigree of gold in the East Driefontein mine.
</P>
<P>
   It's all in a day's work for scientists who search for life that
exists in the world miles below us.

<P>
   The water is warm and deep and clear. Four scuba divers splash
in, signal the go-ahead, and then slip below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   As they drift down, the sunlight transforms the bright hues of
their gear into a moving palette. Then the swimmers are lost from
sight.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a scene from ``Sea Hunt'' _ except that the divers
have plunged into a bottomless hole in the heart of the Mojave
Desert, more than 200 miles from the nearest ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion is the semiannual pupfish count in Ash Meadows,
Nev., a 24,000-acre oasis of clay dunes, spring-fed pools, and
plants and animals found nowhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
   On this morning in late March, representatives of the National
Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Nevada
Division of Wildlife have gathered to assay the fortunes of an
animal that lives here, in what is perhaps the most restricted and
isolated environment occupied by any fish anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   That environment is Devils Hole, a limestone cave filled
year-round with warm water that flows up from an underground
aquifer.
</P>
<P>
   It's the pupfish that draw the divers and their retinue twice
yearly. To the untrained eye, the Devils Hole pupfish, Cyprinodon
diabolis, is an unremarkable creature: It looks like a stout, steel
blue minnow.
</P>
<P>
   To knowledgeable observers, the fish is a prime example of
evolution _ and possibly extinction _ in action.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 10,000 years, the Devils Hole pupfish has adapted
to increasingly extreme conditions as post-Ice Age climate changes
have shrunk its habitat from a sizable lake to the ecological
equivalent of a kiddie pool.
</P>
<P>
   With their thermal sources and arid environs, desert springs
have some of the highest temperatures, greatest salt concentrations
and lowest oxygen contents of any fish habitat.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils Hole pupfish and other pupfish species that were
stranded in the Mojave by receding waters have developed unique
physiological mechanisms to cope with these pressures.
</P>
<P>
   But pupfish still need water, however salty, stagnant or hot.
And for the Devils Hole pupfish, that resource has been further
threatened since the late 1960s, when pumping from nearby springs
for farm irrigation began to deplete the underground water supply
that feeds the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that C. diabolis is classified as an
endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, after a contest pitting developers and state
supremacists against federal statutes and conservationists, the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled that protecting the pupfish from an
unnatural extinction also meant protecting its home. In particular,
the court ruled that water levels in Devils Hole must be kept high
enough to top an algae-covered rock shelf at the mouth of the cave
where the fish do most of their feeding and spawning.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the ruling, development in the area was halted,
and in 1984 the Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge was
established.
</P>
<P>
   Desert-fish advocates have long felt the need to keep tabs on
the imperiled pupfish population itself. Scuba-diving biologist
Stan Hillyard of the University of Nevada at Las Vegas has been
counting pupfish for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   This year, as in most others, he accompanies his fellow divers
about 80 feet down the hole, to a flat shelf called Anvil Rock,
then begins a slow ascent.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing each other up a staircase of ledges that can't be seen
from the surface, Hillyard and a colleague use waterproof tablets
to tally the fish. The other two members of the group are certified
cave divers who watch over the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Devils Hole is a notoriously dangerous place to dive: Despite
expeditions down 400 feet and more by the U.S. Geological Survey,
no one has ever found the bottom of the cave, and at least two
people have died here during recreational dives (which are no
longer permitted). Their bodies were never found.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, safe on dry land, National Park Service biologist
Doug Threloff supervises the surface count. This involves crouching
over the spawning shelf and staring through half a foot of water
and algae to enumerate fish that look exactly like other fish
you've already counted and which, because they refuse to keep
still, may in fact be other fish you've already counted.
</P>
<P>
   It's an imprecise science. When the divers reappear about 40
minutes later, the surface and submarine counts are added for a
total of 196. A second count in the afternoon, using the same
procedures, yields a sum of just 182.
</P>
<P>
   Threloff is troubled by the numbers, which have been low for the
past two years. The population tends to build over the summer as
fry hatch on the shelf, so fall counts are usually higher.
</P>
<P>
   In good years, more than 500 fish have thrived in a Devils Hole
autumn. But it's not clear just how low the spring count can go
without jeopardizing the pupfish's seasonal rebound and long-term
survival.
</P>
<P>
   Directly or indirectly, almost all of the Ash Meadows endemics
rely on fossil water stored in underground basins since the end of
the last Ice Age. The springwater in Devils Hole is known to be at
least 8,000 years old, and Threloff worries that it may never
return to its pre-pumping level.
</P>
<P>
   Farms and mining operations to the north could still be
depleting the Ash Meadows supply, albeit slowly, as they draw more
water than is replaced by the region's meager rain and snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   The most tangible evidence of that depletion would show up at
Devils Hole, where water levels have in fact been dropping again
since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the pupfish is a kind of canary in a coal mine for all the
plants and animals in Ash Meadows. As such, it has a sorry song to
sing.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the fish repeat the trick by which our ancestors crawled
out of the sea and onto land, they could perish along with their
jewel blue pool.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the edge of that pool, with the spring sun hinting
at summer's heat, it's not hard to imagine how the underground
oasis at Devils Hole might one day become a mirage.

   That environment is Devils Hole, a limestone cave filled
year-round with warm water that flows up from an underground
aquifer.
</P>
<P>
   It's the pupfish that draw the divers and their retinue twice
yearly. To the untrained eye, the Devils Hole pupfish, Cyprinodon
diabolis, is an unremarkable creature: It looks like a stout, steel
blue minnow.
</P>
<P>
   To knowledgeable observers, the fish is a prime example of
evolution _ and possibly extinction _ in action.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 10,000 years, the Devils Hole pupfish has adapted
to increasingly extreme conditions as post-Ice Age climate changes
have shrunk its habitat from a sizable lake to the ecological
equivalent of a kiddie pool.
</P>
<P>
   With their thermal sources and arid environs, desert springs
have some of the highest temperatures, greatest salt concentrations
and lowest oxygen contents of any fish habitat.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils Hole pupfish and other pupfish species that were
stranded in the Mojave by receding waters have developed unique
physiological mechanisms to cope with these pressures.
</P>
<P>
   But pupfish still need water, however salty, stagnant or hot.
And for the Devils Hole pupfish, that resource has been further
threatened since the late 1960s, when pumping from nearby springs
for farm irrigation began to deplete the underground water supply
that feeds the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that C. diabolis is classified as an
endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, after a contest pitting developers and state
supremacists against federal statutes and conservationists, the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled that protecting the pupfish from an
unnatural extinction also meant protecting its home. In particular,
the court ruled that water levels in Devils Hole must be kept high
enough to top an algae-covered rock shelf at the mouth of the cave
where the fish do most of their feeding and spawning.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the ruling, development in the area was halted,
and in 1984 the Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge was
established.
</P>
<P>
   Desert-fish advocates have long felt the need to keep tabs on
the imperiled pupfish population itself. Scuba-diving biologist
Stan Hillyard of the University of Nevada at Las Vegas has been
counting pupfish for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   This year, as in most others, he accompanies his fellow divers
about 80 feet down the hole, to a flat shelf called Anvil Rock,
then begins a slow ascent.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing each other up a staircase of ledges that can't be seen
from the surface, Hillyard and a colleague use waterproof tablets
to tally the fish. The other two members of the group are certified
cave divers who watch over the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Devils Hole is a notoriously dangerous place to dive: Despite
expeditions down 400 feet and more by the U.S. Geological Survey,
no one has ever found the bottom of the cave, and at least two
people have died here during recreational dives (which are no
longer permitted). Their bodies were never found.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, safe on dry land, National Park Service biologist
Doug Threloff supervises the surface count. This involves crouching
over the spawning shelf and staring through half a foot of water
and algae to enumerate fish that look exactly like other fish
you've already counted and which, because they refuse to keep
still, may in fact be other fish you've already counted.
</P>
<P>
   It's an imprecise science. When the divers reappear about 40
minutes later, the surface and submarine counts are added for a
total of 196. A second count in the afternoon, using the same
procedures, yields a sum of just 182.
</P>
<P>
   Threloff is troubled by the numbers, which have been low for the
past two years. The population tends to build over the summer as
fry hatch on the shelf, so fall counts are usually higher.
</P>
<P>
   In good years, more than 500 fish have thrived in a Devils Hole
autumn. But it's not clear just how low the spring count can go
without jeopardizing the pupfish's seasonal rebound and long-term
survival.
</P>
<P>
   Directly or indirectly, almost all of the Ash Meadows endemics
rely on fossil water stored in underground basins since the end of
the last Ice Age. The springwater in Devils Hole is known to be at
least 8,000 years old, and Threloff worries that it may never
return to its pre-pumping level.
</P>
<P>
   Farms and mining operations to the north could still be
depleting the Ash Meadows supply, albeit slowly, as they draw more
water than is replaced by the region's meager rain and snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   The most tangible evidence of that depletion would show up at
Devils Hole, where water levels have in fact been dropping again
since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the pupfish is a kind of canary in a coal mine for all the
plants and animals in Ash Meadows. As such, it has a sorry song to
sing.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the fish repeat the trick by which our ancestors crawled
out of the sea and onto land, they could perish along with their
jewel blue pool.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the edge of that pool, with the spring sun hinting
at summer's heat, it's not hard to imagine how the underground
oasis at Devils Hole might one day become a mirage.

<P>
   Four scientists wearing coveralls and hard hats shuffle warily
into a steel cage the size of a closet, cramming themselves against
a dozen miners.
</P>
<P>
   The doors clang shut, and the group plunges hundreds of stories
down into the darkness _ No. 5 Shaft in South Africa's East
Driefontein gold mine. The goal: to find living microbes living
deep in the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Within moments the air becomes oppressively hot. This is one of
the farthest-reaching excavations in the world, burrowing more than
two miles toward the center of Earth.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the mine, radioactivity and heat from the
planet's core raise the temperature of the stone in the tunnels to
a searing 120 F, and the atmospheric pressure is double that on the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen rarely exists naturally so far underground, and only a
constant rush of forced air from the surface disperses poisonous
methane and hydrogen seeping from the rock. Pumped-in jets of water
help keep workers from slowly cooking to death.
</P>
<P>
   Geologist T.C. Onstott, a Princeton professor, pulls a water
bottle from his knapsack and takes a swig. To him, the heat and
claustrophobia are merely aggravation. Real worry for the team of
scientists, as well as the miners, centers on ``seismic events'' _
high-pressure cave-ins that kill.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to obtain samples from wells that have not been
contaminated by air or water from the surface. Onstott decided he
had to find a way to visit the microbes himself. The mine he chose
to explore is part of a sprawling manmade underworld started on a
Sunday morning in 1886 when an Australian prospector found a
gold-rich outcrop on the present site of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Like a nose peeping out of the covers, that outcrop was just the
start. Since then, three-quarters of the gold ever mined has come
out of the region. The most recent shaft at East Driefontein took
15 years to excavate _ and that was just the vertical hole.
</P>
<P>
   For his journey into this biosphere, Onstott rounded up an
all-star crew of microbiologists. They included: Bill Ghiorse, who
led Environmental Protection Agency research into subsurface
bacteria that eat toxic waste; Duane Moser, a lab wizard and avid
spelunker; Svetlana Kotelnikova, a Russian scientist working in
Sweden; Mary DeFlaun of Envirogen, an environmental technology
firm; and Jim Fredrickson, who has isolated many deep-bacteria
cultures while working at the Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   At East Driefontein, Onstott and his team would spend three
months gathering samples at a depth where no microbe hunters had
ventured before: The No. 5 Shaft bottoms out at 11,222 feet.
</P>
<P>
   On this scouting mission, the elevator slowly comes to a halt at
6,120 feet and the researchers walk through a short tunnel to a
second elevator that takes them to the mine's deepest diggings. At
the bottom, the group boards a miniature train for a half-mile ride
through the dark as a giant air pipe roars overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The train stops at a dark hole in the wall: the stope, or mining
face. The passage dips down at a steep angle; in many sections the
ceiling is only three feet high.
</P>
<P>
   The stope swarms with miners. Drills, saws and jackhammers roar
so loudly that hand signals must be used. Amid the pandemonium, the
scientists find their objective: a black coal-like vein interwoven
with round stones and sparkly filaments.
</P>
<P>
   This mineral-rich seam is dubbed the carbon leader. Often no
more than a finger wide, sandwiched in a mass of ancient quartzite,
the carbon leader is heavily laced with uranium and holds an
extraordinary concentration of gold.
</P>
<P>
   No one is certain how the carbon leader formed. It could be the
remains of either algae that settled on an ancient sea bottom or
oil that shot through a crack underground. In any case, the rock
formation is loaded with carbon compounds potentially nutritious to
microbes.
</P>
<P>
   Strong evidence that microbes could survive in an even more
austere environment was uncovered in 1995, when a team working at
the Department of Energy's Hanford Reservation in Washington found
rock-eating organisms that get their sustenance from elemental
mineral energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   The microbes were taken from groundwater sitting in igneous
basalt 4,500 feet down. In a series of lab experiments,
microbiologist Todd Stevens of Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory showed that basalt may react with groundwater to release
hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
   The microbes combine the hydrogen with carbon dioxide in the
water to make organic compounds. Their main waste product is
methane _ a natural gas long thought to be formed mainly near the
surface by swamp-dwelling microbes, and in the depths of Earth by
nonbiological chemical reactions.
</P>
<P>
   But eating is only half the equation. Like us, many bacteria
must respire _ combine food with some other substance to release
energy. Our respiratory agent is oxygen, a byproduct of plant
photosynthesis.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen is rare below ground, where microbiologists have found
organisms that breathe an astounding variety of alternatives:
ferric iron, sulfate, nitrate, nitrite, uranium and carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   In rocks Onstott gathered on a 1996 visit to another South
African mine, microbiologists Jim Fredrickson and Tom Kieft
discovered a heat-resistant bacterium that inhales iron, nitrate,
manganese, sulfur, chromium, cobalt and oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   At East Driefontein, Onstott planned to gather more samples to
test a hypothesis that some deep bacteria extract energy from
elements released as byproducts of the natural radioactivity of the
rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, crouched before the carbon leader, he reaches out and
touches the seam with a Geiger counter.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a drill starts up somewhere, shaking the place like an
earthquake. Rock fragments bounce off helmets. The group of
researchers moves on, looking for a safer spot.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred feet down, they come upon a newly blasted section
of tunnel where miners are shoving steel hydraulic jacks called
rock props against the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good!'' Onstott hollers. ``Means it's fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Moser pulls out a ball peen hammer and a sterilized chisel and
pounds at the crumbly ore. When he is done, Onstott _ with precious
samples in hand _ and his fellow scientists finally smile. They
climb slowly down the stope to another railroad tunnel and begin
hiking out.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Onstott's team were in for a surprise: Some stones
appeared to house between 100,000 and 1 million microbes per gram.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's 100 times what we expected,'' Onstott says.
</P>
<P>
   The team's trove also included mine-water samples containing
rod-shaped microbes six times the size of many surface microbes.
Some of the bugs breathe iron; some live on methane. Others might
eat hydrogen freed when radiation breaks down water molecules.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists even speculate that some of the deep microbes may
have deposited the filigree of gold in the East Driefontein mine.

<P>
   The water is warm and deep and clear. Four scuba divers splash
in, signal the go-ahead, and then slip below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   As they drift down, the sunlight transforms the bright hues of
their gear into a moving palette. Then the swimmers are lost from
sight.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a scene from ``Sea Hunt'' _ except that the divers
have plunged into a bottomless hole in the heart of the Mojave
Desert, more than 200 miles from the nearest ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion is the semiannual pupfish count in Ash Meadows,
Nev., a 24,000-acre oasis of clay dunes, spring-fed pools, and
plants and animals found nowhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
   On this morning in late March, representatives of the National
Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Nevada
Division of Wildlife have gathered to assay the fortunes of an
animal that lives here, in what is perhaps the most restricted and
isolated environment occupied by any fish anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   That environment is Devils Hole, a limestone cave filled
year-round with warm water that flows up from an underground
aquifer.
</P>
<P>
   It's the pupfish that draw the divers and their retinue twice
yearly. To the untrained eye, the Devils Hole pupfish, Cyprinodon
diabolis, is an unremarkable creature: It looks like a stout, steel
blue minnow.
</P>
<P>
   To knowledgeable observers, the fish is a prime example of
evolution _ and possibly extinction _ in action.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 10,000 years, the Devils Hole pupfish has adapted
to increasingly extreme conditions as post-Ice Age climate changes
have shrunk its habitat from a sizable lake to the ecological
equivalent of a kiddie pool.
</P>
<P>
   With their thermal sources and arid environs, desert springs
have some of the highest temperatures, greatest salt concentrations
and lowest oxygen contents of any fish habitat.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils Hole pupfish and other pupfish species that were
stranded in the Mojave by receding waters have developed unique
physiological mechanisms to cope with these pressures.
</P>
<P>
   But pupfish still need water, however salty, stagnant or hot.
And for the Devils Hole pupfish, that resource has been further
threatened since the late 1960s, when pumping from nearby springs
for farm irrigation began to deplete the underground water supply
that feeds the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that C. diabolis is classified as an
endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, after a contest pitting developers and state
supremacists against federal statutes and conservationists, the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled that protecting the pupfish from an
unnatural extinction also meant protecting its home. In particular,
the court ruled that water levels in Devils Hole must be kept high
enough to top an algae-covered rock shelf at the mouth of the cave
where the fish do most of their feeding and spawning.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the ruling, development in the area was halted,
and in 1984 the Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge was
established.
</P>
<P>
   Desert-fish advocates have long felt the need to keep tabs on
the imperiled pupfish population itself. Scuba-diving biologist
Stan Hillyard of the University of Nevada at Las Vegas has been
counting pupfish for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   This year, as in most others, he accompanies his fellow divers
about 80 feet down the hole, to a flat shelf called Anvil Rock,
then begins a slow ascent.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing each other up a staircase of ledges that can't be seen
from the surface, Hillyard and a colleague use waterproof tablets
to tally the fish. The other two members of the group are certified
cave divers who watch over the proceedings.

   Devils Hole is a notoriously dangerous place to dive: Despite
expeditions down 400 feet and more by the U.S. Geological Survey,
no one has ever found the bottom of the cave, and at least two
people have died here during recreational dives (which are no
longer permitted). Their bodies were never found.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, safe on dry land, National Park Service biologist
Doug Threloff supervises the surface count. This involves crouching
over the spawning shelf and staring through half a foot of water
and algae to enumerate fish that look exactly like other fish
you've already counted and which, because they refuse to keep
still, may in fact be other fish you've already counted.
</P>
<P>
   It's an imprecise science. When the divers reappear about 40
minutes later, the surface and submarine counts are added for a
total of 196. A second count in the afternoon, using the same
procedures, yields a sum of just 182.
</P>
<P>
   Threloff is troubled by the numbers, which have been low for the
past two years. The population tends to build over the summer as
fry hatch on the shelf, so fall counts are usually higher.
</P>
<P>
   In good years, more than 500 fish have thrived in a Devils Hole
autumn. But it's not clear just how low the spring count can go
without jeopardizing the pupfish's seasonal rebound and long-term
survival.
</P>
<P>
   Directly or indirectly, almost all of the Ash Meadows endemics
rely on fossil water stored in underground basins since the end of
the last Ice Age. The springwater in Devils Hole is known to be at
least 8,000 years old, and Threloff worries that it may never
return to its pre-pumping level.
</P>
<P>
   Farms and mining operations to the north could still be
depleting the Ash Meadows supply, albeit slowly, as they draw more
water than is replaced by the region's meager rain and snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   The most tangible evidence of that depletion would show up at
Devils Hole, where water levels have in fact been dropping again
since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the pupfish is a kind of canary in a coal mine for all the
plants and animals in Ash Meadows. As such, it has a sorry song to
sing.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the fish repeat the trick by which our ancestors crawled
out of the sea and onto land, they could perish along with their
jewel blue pool.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the edge of that pool, with the spring sun hinting
at summer's heat, it's not hard to imagine how the underground
oasis at Devils Hole might one day become a mirage.

<P>
   The water is warm and deep and clear. Four scuba divers splash
in, signal the go-ahead, and then slip below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   As they drift down, the sunlight transforms the bright hues of
their gear into a moving palette. Then the swimmers are lost from
sight.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a scene from ``Sea Hunt'' _ except that the divers
have plunged into a bottomless hole in the heart of the Mojave
Desert, more than 200 miles from the nearest ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion is the semiannual pupfish count in Ash Meadows,
Nev., a 24,000-acre oasis of clay dunes, spring-fed pools, and
plants and animals found nowhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
   On this morning in late March, representatives of the National
Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Nevada
Division of Wildlife have gathered to assay the fortunes of an
animal that lives here, in what is perhaps the most restricted and
isolated environment occupied by any fish anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   That environment is Devils Hole, a limestone cave filled
year-round with warm water that flows up from an underground
aquifer.
</P>
<P>
   It's the pupfish that draw the divers and their retinue twice
yearly. To the untrained eye, the Devils Hole pupfish, Cyprinodon
diabolis, is an unremarkable creature: It looks like a stout, steel
blue minnow.
</P>
<P>
   To knowledgeable observers, the fish is a prime example of
evolution _ and possibly extinction _ in action.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 10,000 years, the Devils Hole pupfish has adapted
to increasingly extreme conditions as post-Ice Age climate changes
have shrunk its habitat from a sizable lake to the ecological
equivalent of a kiddie pool.
</P>
<P>
   With their thermal sources and arid environs, desert springs
have some of the highest temperatures, greatest salt concentrations
and lowest oxygen contents of any fish habitat.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils Hole pupfish and other pupfish species that were
stranded in the Mojave by receding waters have developed unique
physiological mechanisms to cope with these pressures.
</P>
<P>
   But pupfish still need water, however salty, stagnant or hot.
And for the Devils Hole pupfish, that resource has been further
threatened since the late 1960s, when pumping from nearby springs
for farm irrigation began to deplete the underground water supply
that feeds the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that C. diabolis is classified as an
endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, after a contest pitting developers and state
supremacists against federal statutes and conservationists, the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled that protecting the pupfish from an
unnatural extinction also meant protecting its home. In particular,
the court ruled that water levels in Devils Hole must be kept high
enough to top an algae-covered rock shelf at the mouth of the cave
where the fish do most of their feeding and spawning.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the ruling, development in the area was halted,
and in 1984 the Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge was
established.
</P>
<P>
   Desert-fish advocates have long felt the need to keep tabs on
the imperiled pupfish population itself. Scuba-diving biologist
Stan Hillyard of the University of Nevada at Las Vegas has been
counting pupfish for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   This year, as in most others, he accompanies his fellow divers
about 80 feet down the hole, to a flat shelf called Anvil Rock,
then begins a slow ascent.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing each other up a staircase of ledges that can't be seen
from the surface, Hillyard and a colleague use waterproof tablets
to tally the fish. The other two members of the group are certified
cave divers who watch over the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Devils Hole is a notoriously dangerous place to dive: Despite
expeditions down 400 feet and more by the U.S. Geological Survey,
no one has ever found the bottom of the cave, and at least two
people have died here during recreational dives (which are no
longer permitted). Their bodies were never found.

minutes later, the surface and submarine counts are added for a
total of 196. A second count in the afternoon, using the same

</P>
<P>
   Threloff is troubled by the numbers, which have been low for the
past two years. The population tends to build over the summer as

PARAGUAY'S `ARCHIVES OF TERROR' DETAIL YEARS OF REPRESSION 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay _ When Martin Almada asked a judge for
records of his arrest under the dictatorship of General Alfredo
Stroessner, he hoped merely to learn more about his own private
tragedy: nearly four years of captivity, during which police
telephoned his wife so she would hear his screams under torture.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Almada, a one-time school teacher, and the judge
unearthed a mountain of records detailing repression among
U.S.-backed military regimes throughout South America during the
Cold War. From floor to ceiling, five tons of reports and photos
detailed the arrest, interrogation and disappearance of thousands
of political prisoners during Stroessner's 35-year dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   The documents trace the creation and work of Operation Condor, a
secret plan among security forces in six countries to crush
left-wing political dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Paraguayans quickly nicknamed the files the ``archives of
terror.'' Though discovered in 1992, the files have gained new
prominence throughout Latin America with the arrest of Chile's
former dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, in London last October. To
this day, they remain the only extensive collection of public
records of a project by the region's military rulers that succeeded
in exterminating thousands of political opponents, many of whom had
sought sanctuary in one another's countries.
</P>
<P>
   The files have given a kind of vindication to survivors, their
families and the families of those dead and missing, by delivering
concrete proof of a secretive era that might otherwise be lost in
the ether of memory and denial.
</P>
<P>
   The archives have also provided fodder for the developing case
against Pinochet, the only one of the region's dictators to face
the prospect of trial. Stroessner remains a fugitive in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Baltazar Garzon, the Spanish magistrate seeking the extradition
of Pinochet from England, has collected more than 1,500 pages of
evidence from the archives. Last December, he requested records on
Bolivia's current President, Hugo Banzer, who ran the military
regime there from 1971 to 1978, and on Stroessner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This documentation might exist in other countries as well, but
it's hidden, while in Paraguay they didn't manage to hide it all,''
Juan Garces, the lawyer who brought the suit against Pinochet, said
in a telephone interview from Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It proves that there was an organization with a structure and
discipline that didn't only exchange information but committed
criminal acts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence sharing between Washington's allies in South
America did not begin with Operation Condor, but the plan
formalized and deepened cooperation among police and military
forces that had taken power in six countries _ Brazil, Argentina,
Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   After Gen. Manuel Contreras of Chile invited security chiefs to
create ``the basis of an excellent coordination and improved
action'' at a meeting in November 1975, police from member
countries began to operate in each others' jurisdictions. Their new
ties allowed security officials to participate in joint
interrogations, to pursue nationals across borders and to order
surveillance on citizens who sought asylum in other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Trained during the Cold War at the School of the Americas in
Panama, the officials viewed their enemy as Communism, backed by
Moscow in a subversive war without frontiers. To prevail,
governments, too, would have to work across borders, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The security threats were not entirely imagined. Armed rebels
like the Montoneros in Argentina did aim to destabilize some
governments. But in other countries there were no rebel movements,
and military regimes used the club of anti-Communism to snuff out
any calls for democracy or labor rights.
</P>
<P>
   In Chile, Pinochet had overthrown the democratically elected
president, Salvador Allende Gossens, a Socialist, and hunted down
his Cabinet officials and supporters. Among them was Orlando
Letelier, the Chilean ambassador to the United States who was
killed when his car exploded on a street in Washington; his
American aide, Ronni Moffitt, also was killed.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1979 Senate Foreign Relations Report, which
remains classified, the killings in Argentina of Gen. Carlos Prats
of Chile and Gen. Juan Jose Torres of Bolivia were also reportedly
the work of Operation Condor, as was the attempted assassination of
a Chilean senator, Bernardo Leighton, in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In Paraguay, the targets of Stroessner included members of a
rival faction in the governing Colorado Party, doctors who refused
to cover up torture and Almada, who had criticized the educational
system in his doctoral dissertation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I was an intellectual terrorist,'' Almada said. He
blames Paraguayan police for the death of his 33-year-old wife, who
suffered a heart attack and died after hearing his screams over the
telephone.

</P>
<P>
   Two of the thousands of cases contained in the archives are
those of Gladys Sannemann and Augustin Goiburu, physicians in
Asuncion who refused to falsify an autopsy to show that a man
beaten to death under police custody in 1958 had died of natural
causes. Instead, Sannemann took the cadaver to her medical school
in Asuncion and performed a proper autopsy before her students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practically from that moment it began,'' said Sannemann, an
immunologist who is now 69 and practicing here in Asuncion. The
challenge marked her out for the Stroessner regime.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking safety, Sannemann and her husband, Rodolfo Jorge, fled
to Brazil in 1963, a year before the military seized power there,
and then moved to Argentina. But in March 1976, the military took
power in Argentina as well, making Sannemann and other exiles
targets of the new regime.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the coup, Argentine police abducted Sannemann and
tortured her at the Escuela Mecanica in Buenos Aires. Sannemann
said she was bound and plunged into a bathtub of vomit and
excrement, in a torture nicknamed ``the submarine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They accused me of killing a patient in my office,'' Sannemann
said, calling the charge ``a total lie.'' Then police falsely
accused her of selling drugs, she recalled. ``They said anything
that occurred to them,'' she said. A week later, Sannemann's
husband was abducted and tortured as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sannemann landed at the Emboscada camp for political prisoners
in Paraguay, where she treated more than 400 fellow prisoners from
several South American countries, including widows whose husbands
had been executed _ to silence them _ and their children .
</P>
<P>
   Sannemann and her husband were eventually given asylum in
Germany in 1997, after the German government pressured Argentina
for their release.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Goiburu, who also refused to whitewash torture,
remained a mystery until the archives were opened. In 1977, Goiburu
was kidnapped from a street in Missiones, an Argentine town where
he had gone to escape the Stroessner regime. The government
steadily denied any knowledge of Goiburu's disappearance to his
wife, ElbaElisa Benitez de Goiburu.
</P>
<P>
   The archives, however, contained surveillance reports and photos
of the doctor's house and office, and showed that eliminating him
had become a priority for Stroessner. In a bitterly comic twist,
one effort to kidnap Goiburu collapsed after the Paraguayans balked
at the price Argentine agents demanded for the job, according to
documents in the archive.
</P>
<P>
   Stroessner declined repeated requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Goiburu said she has no doubt that it was Condor that had
swooped down to persecute her family and eventually to take her
husband's life, though he has never been found.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The archives do not detail Washington's role in Cold War
repression here. Along with documents surfacing elsewhere, however,
they suggest U.S. officials backed Condor nations not only with
military aid, but with information. Last month, the United States
declassified 20,000 pages of documents from the Cold War era,
mostly involving Chile. Some of them have made their way to Garzon.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The archives here show that a U.S. military official, Col.
Robert Thierry, apparently helped design the apparatus of the
police state, as he trained police for the Technical Section soon
after Stroessner seized power here in 1954. A relative, Margaret
Van Skike, located in Galveston, Texas, said that Thierry died
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the FBI released a document confirming that
it had provided the Pinochet regime with information about Jorge
Isaac Fuentes de Alarcon, the leader of a leftist movement in Chile
who, the archives here show, was first seized and interrogated by
Paraguayan agents. FBI officers checked addresses in the United
States found in Fuentes' personal phone book, and gave the results
and information on Fuentes' questioning in Paraguay to the Pinochet
regime. Fuentes later disappeared under Chilean custody.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The archives here include friendly letters, law enforcement
magazines and books from the FBI to Paraguayan police officials
whose human rights records had come under fire even then.
</P>
<P>
   In one letter, FBI Director Clarence Kelley wishes Pastor
Coronel, the long-time head of the Department of Investigations who
is now serving a 25-year sentence for torture, ``a truly joyous
Christmas and a New Year filled with all the good things you so
richly deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley died two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The archives also shed light on the killing of Letelier, the
ambassador, in Washington. Two weeks before the assassination,
Contreras, the Chilean colonel, requested $600,000 from the
Pinochet government for ``the neutralization of the governing
junta's principal adversaries overseas, especially in Mexico,
Argentina, Costa Rica, the United States, France and Italy'' in a
memo.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the FBI defended the information sharing with
Chile as standard practice among law enforcement agencies of
governments friendly to Washington. A State Department spokesman
declined to comment on the record of U.S. cooperation with the
South American dictatorships, saying it was ``ancient history.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the archives in 1992, coming as Paraguayans
tackled their first democratic presidential elections, brought
euphoria at first.
</P>
<P>
   As news of the trove spread, victims of the dictatorship flocked
to the police station at Lambare, some 15 miles outside the
capital. Mrs. Goiburu sought word about her husband. Sannemann came
in disbelief. Gloria Estrago, a former political prisoner, felt as
if she had stumbled onto ``the Vatican's secret treasures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like finding our comrades alive again, like
something from science fiction,'' said Ms. Estrago, who is now a
judge.
</P>
<P>
   When she saw the files, Ms. Estrago said she imagined an old
friend who had vanished in police custody, Mario Sher Prono,
calling out to her now, saying, ``Here's proof of what happened to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many activists, early exhilaration has given way to
disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   Upon discovery of the archives, they complain, journalists,
police, and even victims like Almada hauled away cartons of
records. Key documents published in newspapers days after their
discovery vanished from the archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt they have been sanitized,'' Ms. Palau said.
</P>
<P>
   The archives, at least now, contain no direct accounts of
tortures or deaths, only of prisoners who police arrested but never
released, and formulaic confessions that say nothing about the
methods used to obtain them. Gaps in the sequences of numbered
letters from the FBI suggest missing correspondence. And the
archives do not address the military's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Only five officials here have been convicted for torturing and
killing Paraguayans who challenged the Stroessner dictatorship.
None have apologized for their acts or broken the security forces'
code of silence. Nobody has said where the bodies are buried.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Goiburu said the present government has pressured her to
drop efforts to find her husband's killer, as well as a lawsuit
against Stroessner for her husband's disappearance. Recently,
Paraguay's new president, Luis Gonzalez Macchi, dismissed her from
her job representing the Ministry of Education and Culture in a
national professional association, and Mrs. Goiburu said she has
been warned not to challenge the move.
</P>
<P>
   The dictatorship is over, the widow said, but the reflexes of
terror linger on.

<P>
   Although Moscow's latest Monday massacre _ the firing of Prime
Minister Sergei Stepashin and the entire Cabinet _ was a shock in
the West, for several weeks now in Russia, the media have been
citing the name of Vladimir V. Putin, 46, as a new political
favorite. Since Yevgeny Primakov was abruptly dismissed as prime
minister three months ago, top Kremlin officials have been saying
that Stepashin was destined to become Yeltsin's successor. But
Naina Yeltsin, the president's wife, among others, has been
actively trying to persuade Yeltsin to choose Putin. Yevgeny
Krasnikov is political correspondent for Moscow News. (slugged:

   In six months, Russia is supposed to begin full-scale
destruction of its chemical weapons, according to the Treaty on the
Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of
Chemical Weapons and Their Destruction. But there is no money in
the treasury to do so. It was claimed that without the treaty,
Russia's international prestige would suffer and economic sanctions
would be slapped on us. If, however, it was ratified, supposedly
the international community would pick up much of the tab for the
destruction of our chemical weapons. That is not happening. Tamara
Zlotnikova is head of the Committee for Ecology in the State Duma
of Russia. (slugged: BC-RUSSIA-CHEMICAL-WEAPONS -NYTSF)

   Although Moscow's latest Monday massacre _ the firing of Prime
Minister Sergei Stepashin and the entire Cabinet _ was a shock in
the West, for several weeks now in Russia, the media have been
citing the name of Vladimir V. Putin, 46, as a new political
favorite. Since Yevgeny Primakov was abruptly dismissed as prime
minister three months ago, top Kremlin officials have been saying
that Stepashin was destined to become Yeltsin's successor. But
Naina Yeltsin, the president's wife, among others, has been
actively trying to persuade Yeltsin to choose Putin. Yevgeny
Krasnikov is political correspondent for Moscow News. (slugged:

   In six months, Russia is supposed to begin full-scale
destruction of its chemical weapons, according to the Treaty on the
Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of
Chemical Weapons and Their Destruction. But there is no money in
the treasury to do so. It was claimed that without the treaty,
Russia's international prestige would suffer and economic sanctions
would be slapped on us. If, however, it was ratified, supposedly
the international community would pick up much of the tab for the
destruction of our chemical weapons. That is not happening. Tamara
Zlotnikova is head of the Committee for Ecology in the State Duma
of Russia. (slugged: BC-RUSSIA-CHEMICAL-WEAPONS -NYTSF)

CRACKDOWN ON HOUSING FOR MIGRANT WORKERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont.)   By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WENATCHEE, Wash. _ At the height of cherry-picking season, 12
men were making a patch of woods on Stemilt Hill into a home.
Plastic grocery bags hung from nails in the Ponderosa pine bark:
the pantry. A shard of mirror was wedged into a trunk of another
pine: the bathroom. The kitchen was a Sunbeam propane grill, the
bushes served as toilets, and six cheap tents formed the bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meat we have to buy every day, because it spoils,'' said
Nereo Sanchez, who like the others came from Pachuca, Mexico. Last
year, they stayed in an orchard, but this year the owner will no
longer allow it. They said they had looked for campgrounds, but
found no room. They stayed here on public land, until forest
rangers moved them along.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel bad,'' said his coworker Juan Sanchez. ``When we go
pick, we don't know if our tents will still be here'' at the end of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials estimate that 13,000 of the state's
16,000 cherry pickers do not have adequate housing during the brief
but profitable couple of weeks while the fruit ripens. In a recent
crackdown, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration
and the Department of Labor threatened to close camps run by fruit
growers that did not meet federal health and safety standards.
Faced with fines, many growers stopped letting workers camp in the
orchards.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the state health department created a temporary
licensing program for camps in the orchards with standards which
were supposed to meet federal requirements by next season. Workers
were allowed to stay in tents they bought on their own, which often
leaked and did not provide protection from insects and heat.
Growers had to provide water and toilets but not refrigerators.
Workers used ice-filled coolers to store their food.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hot weather the food ends up floating in water in the
icechest,'' said Richard Terrill, northwest regional administrator
for the safety and health administration.``You have a lot of people
in close quarters, with the danger of communicable diseases. Some
of the camps didn't have an adequate number of toilets and
showers.''
</P>
<P>
   The licensing provisions were intended to give growers an
incentive to supply better, more plentiful shelter for workers, but
they served only to justify the status quo instead of encouraging
growers to meet federal standards, Terrill said.
</P>
<P>
   With growers showing little progress in meeting the tougher
federal standards, the government stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year when we made our objections known, there were
probably a few farmers who decided they wouldn't even provide what
they had provided before, and that probably meant _ I'll be honest
with you _ that several hundred more workers didn't have a place to
camp, he said. ``And I feel bad about that. I know that pinched
people, but hopefully the outcome will be good, so next year and in
the years after, there will be more housing and better housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Growers are not legally required to provide housing, said Dan
Kelly, assistant manager of the Washington Growers Clearing House
Association, a group of 2,800 tree fruit grower members. Most
growers say they cannot afford to build permanent housing for
pickers during a two-week harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Fox, owner of C&AMP;S Orchard in Wenatchee, had a camp on his
property three years ago, but decided to close it. He employs
between 150 and 600 workers, depending on the size of his harvest
on the arid, irrigated hills above the Columbia River.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was economically feasible, I'd love to have the camp,''
Fox said. But he said meeting licensing standards would cost
$400,000 to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unjustifiable expense,'' he said. ``Talk to any
banker, and a banker will laugh you out of the bank.'' He said
workers are better off in a grower's camp than on the roadside.
``It's safer, better, healthier, for everyone concerned,'' Fox
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Guadalupe Gamboa, the state director for the United
Farmworkers of America, is optimistic that the crackdown will
result in improved conditions.
</P>
<P>
   He said establishing state standards for licensing that were
lower than federal requirements was ``a huge subsidy to the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   If growers want to rely on a migrant workforce, he said,
``They've got to find a place for migrants to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmworker advocates point out that growers are willing to make
other large investments in a quick crop, like orchard warming
machines that cost $26,000 just to transport, while showers for the
workers are more likely to be considered a luxury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole issue about short seasons kind of bothers me,'' said
Terrill. ``If you're a grower and you grow a short-season crop, you
still invest in chemicals, tractors, and other equipment. I think
that argument is specious.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherry picking requires special timing and skills; the fruit
must be picked just as soon as it is ripe, and workers must be
careful not to separate the stems from the fruit or damage the
branches where next year's buds will form.
</P>
<P>
   Working from 4 a.m. til noon, when heat can damage the fruit,
pickers can make $4 for filling a 40-pound box, or up to $80 a day.
Many travel for weeks at a time following the ripening from
California to Oregon, then from Washington to Montana. Workers say
living conditions in other states are better, with trailers
available in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   A few solutions are being tried in Washington. About 300 people
found shelter this season through the state's Rent-a-Tent program,
which leased 26 six-person tents for $200 per tent a month to 8
growers during the harvest, with the hope that if enough growers
participate statewide, the tents can move with the workers along
the trail of ripening cherries. In Mattawa, a town on the Columbia,
the state has developed the Esperanza migrant center, a village of
temporary shelters created out of shipping containers. Each
8-by-40-foot structure sleeps six and has windows, air conditioning
and a bathroom with shower.
</P>
<P>
   But such accommodations reach only a small percentage of the
workforce. Many of the rest made do in the woods outside of town.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Padilla, 36, of Yakima, Wash., was camping with seven
other people, including three of her six children. Their dinner was
frying on a propane stove. They drink untreated water from a nearby
creek and have no access to indoor plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like a house or a cabin so we could wash dishes and
shower,'' she said. She and her husband, Lupe Padilla, 39, figured
they each were making $40 a day, not enough to support their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not very good,'' Padilla said, surveying the four tents
pitched near the road. ``But what can we do?''

SOME GOP CANDIDATES BECOMING MORE ACCOMMODATING TO GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prominent Republican presidential candidates are
creating an atmosphere that is subtly but fundamentally more
inviting to gay and lesbian voters than party leaders have been in
recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Sen. John McCain and Elizabeth Dole _
who combined have the lion's share of support among Republicans in
early polls _ have signaled an openness to gay supporters,
including a willingness to appoint them to positions like
ambassadorships.
</P>
<P>
   The new receptivity toward homosexuality follows a similar
soft-pedaling by leading Republicans on abortion. While they still
oppose abortion and are by no means converts on other gay rights
issues like same-sex marriage, the most prominent candidates are
offering a lower-key, more inclusive approach designed to appeal
beyond the conservative base of the party to independent and
Democratic voters in a general election. It also reflects the
continued growing political influence of gay donors and gay voters
across party lines.
</P>
<P>
   The new message on gay supporters is a far cry from 1996, when
Republican nominee Bob Dole returned a $1,000 donation from the Log
Cabin Republicans, a group of gay party members, and from 1992,
when the dominant voice on the issue from Republicans was that of
Patrick Buchanan, whose declaration of a ``culture war'' was aimed
squarely at homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan and other conservative candidates have not changed
their views, and even Bush, McCain and Mrs. Dole have not embraced
a broader gay agenda that also includes adoptions by gays and a
less punitive approach toward gays in the military. But gay
political leaders say the difference in attitude is striking
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tone has totally changed,'' said Rich Tafel, executive
director of the Log Cabin Republicans. ``What I hear is gay
Republicans enthusiastic about the tone being set by the leading
candidates. It looks like Republicans for the first time are
saying, `This is a community I'm not going to alienate and maybe I
want to reach out to it.' That's kind of a shocking revelation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Democrats, of course, have courted gay voters for years, and
this year both Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley,
the two rivals for the Democratic nomination, are competing for
their support. Both campaigns have fund-raisers working expressly
with gay donors, who tend to be generous financially and active
politically.
</P>
<P>
   So intense is the Gore-Bradley rivalry for gay support that the
two candidates even appeared recently at the same gay and lesbian
community center in Los Angeles within a week of each other.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, though, this rapprochement is new. Bush,
so far the run-away favorite in the Republican field, has said he
would have no qualms about hiring gays. ``If someone can do a job,
and a job that he's qualified for, that person ought to be allowed
to do his job,'' he said earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has appointed Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona, the only
openly gay Republican in the House, to his national steering
committee, has similarly said he would hire on merit alone. He has
supported anti-hate-crimes legislation that would protect victims
of crime not only because of their race but their ``sexual
orientation.'' He has said that someday he could envision a gay
president.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole has said she would appoint to her administration
anyone who was qualified, emphasizing in an NBC interview in July
that ``all people are welcome'' and adding: ``I'm inclusive.'' Of
the contribution that her husband spurned in 1996, Mrs. Dole said
that if she received a check from the same group, ``I would not
turn it away.''
</P>
<P>
   William Kristol, who was chief of staff to Vice President Dan
Quayle and now is editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, said
that the mainstream Republican candidates this year were clearly
unhappy under the banner of strident, anti-gay language.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican establishment does not want to fight the
conservative culture war,'' Kristol said, ``partly because they
think it's a losing fight, but more importantly, they don't believe
in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the party establishment, Buchanan and other
conservatives remain adamant. His spokesman, Bob Adams, said
Buchanan ``has certainly not abandoned the culture war.'' Some,
like Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes, make their rejection of
homosexuality a major plank of their platforms. Bauer said recently
that when he heard McCain say the party should be ``a big tent that
admits everybody,'' the phrase sounded to him ``like fingernails on
a chalkboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the wealthy publisher and candidate, flatly
opposes any concessions to gay voters. He frequently says he wants
``equal rights for all, special rights for none.'' Asked if Forbes
would appoint an openly gay person to his administration, his
campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, said: ``If the person is qualified
for the job, that's fine as long as it is not a statement on a life
style or promoting a life style.'' As for gay adoptions, Dal Col
said: ``There are plenty of heterosexual couples out there,'' and
existing laws against hate crimes are enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Louis Sheldon, a staunch conservative who heads a
national group called the Traditional Values Coalition and who has
denounced homosexuals often in his career, denied that there was a
trend among Republicans to reach out to gay voters.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the Republican presidential candidates oppose
homosexuals in the military and same-sex marriages, Sheldon said
that ``there aren't that many Log Cabin voters out there.'' He
added: ``There is nothing immutable about sexual behavior _ it is
chosen.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, anti-gay sentiment is less strident this year. Many
Republicans avoid the matter entirely. Brian Kennedy, the national
political director for former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, said:
``He neither brings up those issues in his stump speech nor do we
ever recall him being asked about it. It doesn't seem to be on the
radar screen for the '99 cycle.'' Adams, Buchanan's spokesman,
agreed. ``It hasn't come up, and we haven't been making it an
issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Quayle, a social conservative who has aggressively promoted
``family values,'' has shown moderation toward homosexuals. Asked
on a radio program last month what he would do if one of his
children were homosexual, he said he would support them ``whatever
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   While he avoided answering specific questions about gays in the
military and gay adoptions, Quayle also said: ``Life-style
orientation really makes no difference to me at all. Believe me, I
don't inquire what one's sexual preference may or may not be.'' He
repeated his view that homosexuality is a choice but did not say,
as he did in 1992, that it was ``a wrong choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristol said that most Republicans were still being careful in
their statements because they did not want to alienate the
grass-roots conservatives who believe homosexuality is a sin. But
the candidates' tempered tone, he said, poses a dilemma for
conservative voters. ``The question is, do conservatives want to
win so badly that they will accept this kind of establishment
leadership?'' he asked. ``Or have they, too, given up on the
culture war? Do they want a political champion for their views?''
</P>
<P>
   Since gays emerged several years ago as a significant voting
bloc, Republicans ceded them to the Democrats. About 5 percent of
voters in 1996 identified themselves in polls of people leaving
voting booths as gay _ ``about the same percentage as Hispanics and
larger than the Jewish vote,'' said Elizabeth Birch, executive
director of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and
lesbian lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   Tafel, who is organizing gay Republican voters this week to
participate in the Iowa straw poll and is seeking a slot for an
openly gay speaker at the Republican national convention next year,
said that the party was finally recognizing the influence of the
gay electorate. ``It's the first time we haven't been take for
granted'' as likely Democrats, he said. His group has yet to make
an endorsement or give any money to any of the presidential
candidates, but it plans to do so closer to next year's convention.
</P>
<P>
   Also making the gay vote more available to Republicans this year
is the fact that liberal Democrats have not been entirely happy
with the Clinton administration's record on gay issues. They have
complained of a lack of financing for the treatment of AIDS, the
opposition to gay marriage and the murky ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy that has allowed a record number of anti-gay discharges from
the military. Such discharges increased 86 percent over the last
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Alert to the potential appeal of Republicans who refrain from
broad cultural attacks, Democrats are warning that the Republicans
are not as tolerant as they may appear. Pat Ewing, a senior adviser
at the Democratic National Committee, said of Bush: ``He is
purposefully vague, not moderate. Bush denied Texans protection
from hate crimes and let it be known that he opposed any provision
to protect gays and lesbians from these crimes. His platitudes are
meant to obscure.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, a spokeswoman for Bush, said he objected to the
hate-crimes legislation because ``all violent crime is motivated by
hate'' and Texas already has a law that covers such crimes. But,
she said, he also did not believe that sexual orientation should be
singled out for special rights. ``He doesn't believe in granting
legal rights based on sexual orientation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has made an extra effort to appeal to homosexuals. In one
of his rare departures from Clinton orthodoxy, he has called for a
more ``compassionate'' _ though unspecific _ approach to
homosexuals in the military.
</P>
<P>
   In California, which is likely to face a ballot initiative next
year that outlaws same-sex marriage, Gore said he favored legal
protections for same-sex partners, like health benefits and
hospital visitation rights, but he opposed ``a change in the
institution of marriage as we now know it between men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   He would leave gay adoptions up to adoption professionals on an
individual basis, his spokesman, Chris Lahane, said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats acknowledge that Gore and Bradley have virtually
identical records on gay issues. Eric Hauser, a spokesman for
Bradley, said he supported a ``review'' of the ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy on gays in the military. He also supports gay
adoptions and extending legal rights, including health benefits and
hospital visitation, to same-sex partners as ``common sense''
measures.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley was in the Senate, he voted for the so-called
defense of marriage act, which said no state had to recognize the
same-sex laws of another state. Likewise, President Clinton signed
the bill into law, and Gore ``stood beside him'' in supporting it,
Ms. Birch said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore has been outspoken in favor of gay issues, he has
also been the target of gay demonstrators. AIDS activists have
cropped up, noisily, at several of his campaign events, accusing
him of siding with drug companies and trying to block South
Africa's access to cheaper generic drugs to fight HIV. His staff
says this is an international patent issue and is trying to work it
out.

   Steve Forbes, the wealthy publisher and candidate, flatly
opposes any concessions to gay voters. He frequently says he wants
``equal rights for all, special rights for none.'' Asked if Forbes
would appoint an openly gay person to his administration, his
campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, said: ``If the person is qualified
for the job, that's fine as long as it is not a statement on a life
style or promoting a life style.'' As for gay adoptions, Dal Col
said: ``There are plenty of heterosexual couples out there,'' and
existing laws against hate crimes are enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Louis Sheldon, a staunch conservative who heads a
national group called the Traditional Values Coalition and who has
denounced homosexuals often in his career, denied that there was a
trend among Republicans to reach out to gay voters.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the Republican presidential candidates oppose
homosexuals in the military and same-sex marriages, Sheldon said
that ``there aren't that many Log Cabin voters out there.'' He
added: ``There is nothing immutable about sexual behavior _ it is
chosen.''

<P>
   Still, anti-gay sentiment is less strident this year. Many
Republicans avoid the matter entirely. Brian Kennedy, the national
political director for former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, said:
``He neither brings up those issues in his stump speech nor do we
ever recall him being asked about it. It doesn't seem to be on the
radar screen for the '99 cycle.'' Adams, Buchanan's spokesman,
agreed. ``It hasn't come up, and we haven't been making it an
issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Quayle, a social conservative who has aggressively promoted
``family values,'' has shown moderation toward homosexuals. Asked
on a radio program last month what he would do if one of his
children were homosexual, he said he would support them ``whatever
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   While he avoided answering specific questions about gays in the
military and gay adoptions, Quayle also said: ``Life-style
orientation really makes no difference to me at all. Believe me, I
don't inquire what one's sexual preference may or may not be.'' He
repeated his view that homosexuality is a choice but did not say,
as he did in 1992, that it was ``a wrong choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristol said that most Republicans were still being careful in
their statements because they did not want to alienate the
grass-roots conservatives who believe homosexuality is a sin. But
the candidates' tempered tone, he said, poses a dilemma for
conservative voters. ``The question is, do conservatives want to
win so badly that they will accept this kind of establishment
leadership?'' he asked. ``Or have they, too, given up on the
culture war? Do they want a political champion for their views?''
</P>
<P>
   Since gays emerged several years ago as a significant voting
bloc, Republicans ceded them to the Democrats. About 5 percent of
voters in 1996 identified themselves in polls of people leaving
voting booths as gay _ ``about the same percentage as Hispanics and
larger than the Jewish vote,'' said Elizabeth Birch, executive
director of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and
lesbian lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   Tafel, who is organizing gay Republican voters this week to
participate in the Iowa straw poll and is seeking a slot for an
openly gay speaker at the Republican national convention next year,
said that the party was finally recognizing the influence of the
gay electorate. ``It's the first time we haven't been take for
granted'' as likely Democrats, he said. His group has yet to make
an endorsement or give any money to any of the presidential
candidates, but it plans to do so closer to next year's convention.
</P>
<P>
   Also making the gay vote more available to Republicans this year
is the fact that liberal Democrats have not been entirely happy
with the Clinton administration's record on gay issues. They have
complained of a lack of financing for the treatment of AIDS, the
opposition to gay marriage and the murky ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy that has allowed a record number of anti-gay discharges from
the military. Such discharges increased 86 percent over the last
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Alert to the potential appeal of Republicans who refrain from
broad cultural attacks, Democrats are warning that the Republicans
are not as tolerant as they may appear. Pat Ewing, a senior adviser
at the Democratic National Committee, said of Bush: ``He is
purposefully vague, not moderate. Bush denied Texans protection
from hate crimes and let it be known that he opposed any provision
to protect gays and lesbians from these crimes. His platitudes are
meant to obscure.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, a spokeswoman for Bush, said he objected to the
hate-crimes legislation because ``all violent crime is motivated by
hate'' and Texas already has a law that covers such crimes. But,
she said, he also did not believe that sexual orientation should be
singled out for special rights. ``He doesn't believe in granting
legal rights based on sexual orientation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has made an extra effort to appeal to homosexuals. In one
of his rare departures from Clinton orthodoxy, he has called for a
more ``compassionate'' _ though unspecific _ approach to
homosexuals in the military.
</P>
<P>
   In California, which is likely to face a ballot initiative next
year that outlaws same-sex marriage, Gore said he favored legal
protections for same-sex partners, like health benefits and
hospital visitation rights, but he opposed ``a change in the
institution of marriage as we now know it between men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   He would leave gay adoptions up to adoption professionals on an
individual basis, his spokesman, Chris Lahane, said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats acknowledge that Gore and Bradley have virtually
identical records on gay issues. Eric Hauser, a spokesman for
Bradley, said he supported a ``review'' of the ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy on gays in the military. He also supports gay
adoptions and extending legal rights, including health benefits and
hospital visitation, to same-sex partners as ``common sense''
measures.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley was in the Senate, he voted for the so-called
defense of marriage act, which said no state had to recognize the
same-sex laws of another state. Likewise, President Clinton signed
the bill into law, and Gore ``stood beside him'' in supporting it,
Ms. Birch said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore has been outspoken in favor of gay issues, he has
also been the target of gay demonstrators. AIDS activists have
cropped up, noisily, at several of his campaign events, accusing
him of siding with drug companies and trying to block South
Africa's access to cheaper generic drugs to fight HIV. His staff
says this is an international patent issue and is trying to work it
out.

   Call it the ``La Bamba'' syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   It's what happens when America delights in a passionate
dalliance with things Latino, then leaves it and moves on to the
next great fad.
</P>
<P>
   The reference, of course, is to the 1987 Hollywood bio-pic about
'50s rocker Richie Valens. But the film just gave it a name. There
are earlier examples of this psycho-cultural complex. In the 1940s,
Dolores del Rio and Carmen Miranda danced into our hearts. In the
1950s, it was Lucy's lovable Ricky Ricardo. Then in 1961, Rita
Moreno made Maria a household name.
</P>
<P>
   Now fast forward to the 1999 super-sequel starring Ricky Martin,
Salma Hayek, Jennifer Lopez and the ghost of Selena. Having spent
most of our lives in mainstream media purgatory, Latinos can't help
but let their hearts revel in the notion that a few of our own have
finally hit the big time.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with fiery love affairs is that they often fizzle.
</P>
<P>
   So when I first caught wind that Newsweek magazine had dedicated
its cover to ``Latin USA'' and a story about how ``Young Hispanics
Are Changing America,'' my first impulse was to cringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another fleeting courtship'' I thought to myself, ``certain to
end in heartache.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, I couldn't help myself. I had to read the Newsweek
articles. Just as I had determined to scrutinize the July edition
of George magazine.
</P>
<P>
   I admittedly was prejudiced. Newsweek, I presumed, would do an
adequate job. Everything would be spelled correctly, the writing
would be pithy and polished, and the facts, however facile, would
be correct.
</P>
<P>
   To Newsweek magazine, I apologize. Not only did they get the
facts straight, but also the package of articles may have been the
first successful mainstream effort in the news media to document
the U.S. Latino experience, through the eyes of Latinos, with just
the right balance of acumen, intelligence and respect.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the articles had to say I already knew. I've been
writing about my community for years. What I appreciated was that
the Newsweek writers managed to put together a package of articles
designed to inform a wider readership of a significant social and
cultural trend _ that's what the news business is supposed to do _
while speaking directly, and sensitively, to the very community
that the articles were about _ U.S. Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   In the articles, America's so-called mainstream readers learn
that 83 percent of Latinos polled by Newsweek said that ``being
Hispanic was important to their identity''; that ``42 percent go to
church once a week''; and that the community is ``an increasingly
unpredictable political force: 37 percent of 18- to 34-year-old
Latinos say they are independent, about twice as many as their
Hispanic elders.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from being pithy and polished, these are facts that are
relevant to the community at large.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek readers also are told that ``Hispanics are clustered in
11 states, with a total of 217 out of the 270 Electoral College
votes'' needed to win the presidency. That explains the ``Me llamo
Al'' (my name is Al) and ``Me llamo Jorge'' (my name is George)
speeches we've been hearing lately on the campaign trail from Al
Gore and George W. Bush, the respective Democrat and Republican
front-runners for their presidential nomination of their parties.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the article also does a respectable job of balancing these
celebratory factoids against the sobering reality that many
Hispanics face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Latinos are assimilated into cycles of urban blight; 40
percent of Latino children now live in poverty, the highest rate
ever'' Newsweek reported. And the magazine reminds us that ``not
everybody has been eager to give Latinos a big abrazo''
(affectionate hug). (The sprinkling of a few Spanglish phrases was
a nice touch.)
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek also did a good job of explaining the multicultural
makeup of U.S. Latinos by featuring quotes and vignettes about
Cubans, Mexican Americans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Colombians
and other Latino ethnic groups. Until I read the article, for
instance, I did not know that Soledad O'Briens Cuban-born mother is
black, and her father is Irish-Australian.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek, of course, is not perfect. Latino readers,
particularly Latino writers, must have winced when they saw the
word ``illegals'' in print _ even if the paragraph that included it
was meant to condemn such stereotypes. So-called illegal or
undocumented immigrants, in almost all cases, are people accused of
violating civil statutes. They are not criminals. The term
``illegals'' also dehumanizes. It's a lot like calling the mentally
ill ``lunatics.''
</P>
<P>
   As for George magazine's attempt to document the expanding role
of Latinos in American politics, I think I now understand why the
magazine is faltering. While I suspect that John F. Kennedy Jr.'s
heart was in the right place when he and his staff set out to put
together ``Latin Heat!'' I couldn't help but wonder if the
magazine's editors weren't tapping their feet to Los Lobos'
rendition of the catchy folk-turned-pop-rock-standard. ``Para
bailarla bamba. Para bailarla bamba.''
</P>
<P>
   George's saving grace would have been its generally well-written
and insightful profile of the Mexican-born actress Salma Hayak, if
it hadn't been for story's garish headline, ``Mexican
Firecracker.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexy photos of Hayak abound, but we also learn she has a knack
for business, and more than a few choice thoughts about domestic
and foreign politics.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, I think Bob Morris, the writer who penned the Hayak
piece, might have been better off selling the story to Newsweek.
These days, at least, Newsweek seems to have a better accent.

   Call it the ``La Bamba'' syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   It's what happens when America delights in a passionate
dalliance with things Latino, then leaves it and moves on to the
next great fad.
</P>
<P>
   The reference, of course, is to the 1987 Hollywood bio-pic about
'50s rocker Richie Valens. But the film just gave it a name. There
are earlier examples of this psycho-cultural complex. In the 1940s,
Dolores del Rio and Carmen Miranda danced into our hearts. In the
1950s, it was Lucy's lovable Ricky Ricardo. Then in 1961, Rita
Moreno made Maria a household name.
</P>
<P>
   Now fast forward to the 1999 super-sequel starring Ricky Martin,
Salma Hayek, Jennifer Lopez and the ghost of Selena. Having spent
most of our lives in mainstream media purgatory, Latinos can't help
but let their hearts revel in the notion that a few of our own have
finally hit the big time.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with fiery love affairs is that they often fizzle.
</P>
<P>
   So when I first caught wind that Newsweek magazine had dedicated
its cover to ``Latin USA'' and a story about how ``Young Hispanics
Are Changing America,'' my first impulse was to cringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another fleeting courtship'' I thought to myself, ``certain to
end in heartache.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, I couldn't help myself. I had to read the Newsweek
articles. Just as I had determined to scrutinize the July edition
of George magazine.
</P>
<P>
   I admittedly was prejudiced. Newsweek, I presumed, would do an
adequate job. Everything would be spelled correctly, the writing
would be pithy and polished, and the facts, however facile, would
be correct.
</P>
<P>
   To Newsweek magazine, I apologize. Not only did they get the
facts straight, but also the package of articles may have been the
first successful mainstream effort in the news media to document
the U.S. Latino experience, through the eyes of Latinos, with just
the right balance of acumen, intelligence and respect.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the articles had to say I already knew. I've been
writing about my community for years. What I appreciated was that
the Newsweek writers managed to put together a package of articles
designed to inform a wider readership of a significant social and
cultural trend _ that's what the news business is supposed to do _
while speaking directly, and sensitively, to the very community
that the articles were about _ U.S. Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   In the articles, America's so-called mainstream readers learn
that 83 percent of Latinos polled by Newsweek said that ``being
Hispanic was important to their identity''; that ``42 percent go to
church once a week''; and that the community is ``an increasingly
unpredictable political force: 37 percent of 18- to 34-year-old
Latinos say they are independent, about twice as many as their
Hispanic elders.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from being pithy and polished, these are facts that are
relevant to the community at large.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek readers also are told that ``Hispanics are clustered in
11 states, with a total of 217 out of the 270 Electoral College
votes'' needed to win the presidency. That explains the ``Me llamo
Al'' (my name is Al) and ``Me llamo Jorge'' (my name is George)
speeches we've been hearing lately on the campaign trail from Al
Gore and George W. Bush, the respective Democrat and Republican
front-runners for their presidential nomination of their parties.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the article also does a respectable job of balancing these
celebratory factoids against the sobering reality that many
Hispanics face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Latinos are assimilated into cycles of urban blight; 40
percent of Latino children now live in poverty, the highest rate
ever'' Newsweek reported. And the magazine reminds us that ``not
everybody has been eager to give Latinos a big abrazo''
(affectionate hug). (The sprinkling of a few Spanglish phrases was
a nice touch.)
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek also did a good job of explaining the multicultural
makeup of U.S. Latinos by featuring quotes and vignettes about
Cubans, Mexican Americans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Colombians
and other Latino ethnic groups. Until I read the article, for
instance, I did not know that Soledad O'Briens Cuban-born mother is
black, and her father is Irish-Australian.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek, of course, is not perfect. Latino readers,
particularly Latino writers, must have winced when they saw the
word ``illegals'' in print _ even if the paragraph that included it
was meant to condemn such stereotypes. So-called illegal or
undocumented immigrants, in almost all cases, are people accused of
violating civil statutes. They are not criminals. The term
``illegals'' also dehumanizes. It's a lot like calling the mentally
ill ``lunatics.''
</P>
<P>
   As for George magazine's attempt to document the expanding role
of Latinos in American politics, I think I now understand why the
magazine is faltering. While I suspect that John F. Kennedy Jr.'s
heart was in the right place when he and his staff set out to put
together ``Latin Heat!'' I couldn't help but wonder if the
magazine's editors weren't tapping their feet to Los Lobos'
rendition of the catchy folk-turned-pop-rock-standard. ``Para
bailarla bamba. Para bailarla bamba.''
</P>
<P>
   George's saving grace would have been its generally well-written
and insightful profile of the Mexican-born actress Salma Hayak, if
it hadn't been for story's garish headline, ``Mexican
Firecracker.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexy photos of Hayak abound, but we also learn she has a knack
for business, and more than a few choice thoughts about domestic
and foreign politics.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, I think Bob Morris, the writer who penned the Hayak
piece, might have been better off selling the story to Newsweek.
These days, at least, Newsweek seems to have a better accent.

SOME FISH STOCKS OFF NEW ENGLAND REBOUNDING, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The gray sole, a traditionally valued flounder called
witch flounder in the Gulf of Maine, has almost completely
rebounded from near-extinction thanks to strict limits on catching
the species, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   The sole is just one of the many troubled Northeast fish that
appear to be on the mend, according to a report on fisheries
released Tuesday. The independent scientific panel indicates
improvements in a dozen commercially valuable and regulated stock,
including yellowtail flounder and sea scallops.
</P>
<P>
   But the tight fishing restrictions probably won't be lifted
anytime soon, the report said, because the stocks of some fish,
such as the Gulf of Maine cod and white hake, still remain at
record low stock levels.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Fisheries Management Council is scheduled to
discuss the report and its implications for future management at a
public meeting Wednesday in Hyannis.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, there have been a wave of fishing restrictions
imposed by the council to help nature replace the fast depleting
fish populations. In 1994, officials closed nearly 6,000 square
miles of fishing ground on Georges Bank, and a series of closures
for the Gulf of Maine started in 1997. In June a portion of the
banks was reopened for scallop fishing only. Scallop stock is at
its highest level since 1982, according to Andrew Applegate, senior
biologist for the New England Fishery Management Council.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Fisheries Management Council also voted to
increase the size of mesh on groundfishermen's nets, which allowed
smaller, younger fish to escape and grow to reproductive maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Applegate said overall the regulations appear to be working,
with the stock of the troubled fish doubling since 1994. The
council projects that the fish populations should be completely
rebuilt within the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   For two species, the Georges Bank yellowtail flounder and
Southern New England winter flounder, more fishing can be allowed
because the population has recovered so well, with more than 90
percent of the target population for both species, said Applegate.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, cod has not fared as well. The stock Gulf of Maine
cod is near record lows, though officials hope it will improve with
reduced catches this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Additional efforts are needed to promote rebuilding for Gulf
of Maine cod to reach objectives,'' said Applegate, which may
include more restrictions for fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   The cod depletion is still too high, he said, even though the
rate at which they are dying is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Along Georges Bank, Applegate said, cod population has been
increasing every year, even though rebuilding prospects have been
poor because the number of young fish surviving has been low.
Scientists project that it will still take at least seven to eight
years to rebuild the cod population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fishing control for Georges Bank has been more effective than
for the Gulf of Maine,'' said Applegate.
</P>
<P>
   The Georges Bank haddock is showing some promise, Applegate
said. Although haddock has only reached 43 percent of its target
population, the 1998 class appears to be the largest in 20 years,
enabling stock recovery to be more quickly than previously though.
Haddock is at its highest stock levels since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Despite increasing fish populations, the council warns that
restrictions are still necessary to rebuild stocks to long-term
sustainable levels. The council will make final decisions about how
to manage the fisheries in September.

   When I was growing up in a nice, relatively safe, lower-middle
class neighborhood of tidy bungalows, concrete porches, one-car
garages and backyard patios half the size of an NBA free-throw
lane, we had very specific definitions of what it meant to be rich.
</P>
<P>
   If your dad bought a new Lincoln Continental or Cadillac Coupe
de Ville every two years, you were rich.
</P>
<P>
   If your family took an airplane on vacations to exotic locales
such as Orlando rather than squeezing everybody sausage-style into
a wood-paneled station wagon for a drive to the Wisconsin Dells,
you were rich.
</P>
<P>
   If people in your family golfed, you were rich.
</P>
<P>
   If you had a color TV with remote control and your driveway was
paved, you were rich.
</P>
<P>
   If each kid in your family had his or her own bedroom, you were
rich.
</P>
<P>
   And if you had a built-in swimming pool in your backyard, well,
you were practically dripping money.
</P>
<P>
   In this tiny corner of the world, the families of dentists and
doctors and lawyers were our Rockefellers and Kennedys and DuPonts.
We didn't know from millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   But almost everybody had a story about how the family could have
been seriously, filthy rich, if only Grandpa or Uncle Freddy or
Great-Aunt Minnie had made the right move in 1893 or 1914 or 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Like my buddy Shemp _ so nicknamed because of the way his hair
always fell across his face, ala Shemp of the Three Stooges. He was
always talking about how his great-grandfather had blown the
opportunity to buy a chunk of a fledgling company that was going to
make a product called Pepsi-Cola. If only!
</P>
<P>
   Who knows if it was true. No doubt great-grandpa passed along
that story as true fact and it traveled through the generations,
just as lots of other relatives from the old days were telling
similar tales. We all had Willy Lomans in our family trees,
lamenting from the grave that they didn't go into the jungle like
brother Ben, who came out a rich man.
</P>
<P>
   I know what my descendants (assuming there are any) are going to
be saying 75 years from now. Something like, ``My family could be
stinkin' rich today, if only my stupid great-grandfather Richard
the First had bought stock in eBay when he had the chance in the
late 1990s!''
</P>
<P>
   Or Amazon, or Yahoo, or America Online. Or Priceline or uBid or
iVillage or DoubleClick, or any of those other darned ``dot-com''
stocks you and I didn't buy when we had the chance, dadgummit!
</P>
<P>
   Too late now. According to people who know these things, most of
the above stocks will probably never reach the value they once
held. And we're certainly well past the point where you could have
bought into one of those companies at a few bucks a share and
watched your investment increase fiftyfold.
</P>
<P>
   The current issue of Time magazine has an article on the
plunging prices of Internet stocks, including a little
picture-chart showing how the heads of some well-known companies
have seen their worths decline greatly in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com used to be worth $13
billion, but now he's worth only $5.3 billion. And Margaret Whitman
of eBay has seen her worth decline from $1.6 billion to a mere $569
million.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I'm still willing to say: Margaret, will you marry me?
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to feel sorry for these people with their
``silly money.'' (That's when you have so much money it's just
plain silly.) All you can do is shake your head and be solid in the
knowledge that are other companies out there right now offering
incredible investment opportunities _ and you'll miss out on those
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's not just the kabillionaire founders who have
made silly money over the last few years; a lot of people have
become rich playing the market. Forget about building a company
from the ground up or working your way to the top of a law firm or
laboring for 15 years to invent an ingenious device that improves
the quality of life for millions of people. It's a lot easier to
buy a few thousand shares of an Internet stock that suddenly
explodes and turns you into an instant millionaire at 27.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone who has pulled off the latter trick doesn't
deserve the money. If you make a brilliant and/or lucky investment
and it flowers into an entire meadow of money, God love ya.
</P>
<P>
   But it kind of reminds me of the talented but usually unknown
authors who win the ``Oprah lottery'' and suddenly find themselves
giving interviews about what it's like to see their book catapult
from nowhere to the top of The New York Times' bestseller list.
It's a wonderful windfall, and any writer feeling the tap of
Oprah's sword on their shoulder would have to be insane to decline
her offer of instant riches and fame _ but I wonder if there's
something just slightly bittersweet about the triumph. Wouldn't it
be better if a half-million people bought your book because they
really wanted to, not because a TV talk show host told them to?
</P>
<P>
   And wouldn't it be more satisfying to achieve fabulous wealth
through something more tangible, rewarding and life-affirming than
the wild rise of an Internet stock? Wouldn't anyone prefer to
really and truly earn that hundred million?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it doesn't make a bit of difference. I suppose we'd all
welcome the opportunity to find out.

JUDGE: REVISION OF RACE-BASED SCHOOL SYSTEM CAN WAIT UNTIL 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Quashing a bid by a group of white parents to end
race-based student assignment in Boston Public Schools by
September, a federal judge ruled Tuesday that racial formulas will
still be used to send students to school next month.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, however, will not affect the Boston School
Committee's recent vote to rid the school district of race-based
student assignment by the fall of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the ``onerous'' task of reassigning as many as
20,000 students within five weeks would be too detrimental to
parents, students and school staff, US Judge Nancy Gertner denied
the request by a group of four white parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I cannot conclude that there is a likelihood of success
on the merits and where the burden of reassigning thousands of
children and the possibility that the beginning of school could be
delayed is so onerous, emergency relief cannot be justified,'' she
wrote in the 34-page decision.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling is the latest in three years of challenges by
white students to various Boston Public School student assignment
and school admission policies. In June, a group of white parents
filed a lawsuit _ 25 years to the day a federal judge ordered the
schools to desegregate _ to rid the system of race-based student
assignment by this September.
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, such ``reverse'' discrimination cases are
winning in federal courts that are shooting down affirmative action
programs, most of which were based on substandard educational
opportunities for blacks in the first half of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, school officials and parents breathed a sigh of
relief as the logistical nightmare they were fearing was averted.
</P>
<P>
   Because schools start at different hours throughout the city,
many parents feared they would have to reconfigure complicated work
or day care schedules if Gertner granted the request.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents also feared their children would be sent to worse
schools then they had been assigned to originally.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Public Schools Superintendent Thomas Payzant said he was
``pleased,'' adding that the white parents' motion was ``not
necessary'' because the School Committee has already pledged to
redesign the student assignment policy for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Chester Darling, the attorney for the four white parents, said
Gertner's ruling will mean disruption for younger students who will
switch schools in September 2000 once a new student assignment plan
is devised.
</P>
<P>
   Darling asked Gertner to reassign all kindergarteners and first
grade students be reassigned to schools without using race.
Currently, students are assigned to schools based on race and
parental choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't going to be that disruptive, there could have been
some flexibility...to make accommodations for these children,''
said Darling.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said the ruling gave him and the advocacy group that
helped file the lawsuit _ Boston's Children First _ renewed
motivation to legally challenge the use of race in any student
assignment plan.
</P>
<P>
   The School Committee voted to abandon the system's race-based
student assignment after the lawsuit was filed because the panel
believed they would lose in court.
</P>
<P>
   Gertner, while criticizing the parents for bringing the lawsuit
so late in the year, noted that: ``In the light of the evolving law
of equal protection,'' their overall challenge to the assignment
plan ``is a fair one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the law were clear and the remedy obvious, I would not
hestitate to order the relief the plaintiffs have requested, no
matter what the cost, just as courts have done when these issues
were raised years ago by minority plaintiffs.''

ISRAEL TO RELEASE EICHMANN DIARY   TO SCHOLARS, JOURNALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV _ Almost 40 years after locking away the handwritten
memoir of Adolf Eichmann, Israel Tuesday announced it would release
the manuscript the Nazi war criminal wrote in prison after he was
captured and brought to trial in the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 1,300 page document, written in Eichmann's
Gothic-style script, has been out of reach to all but a select few
scholars since it was placed in the national archives in 1962,
shortly after Eichmann was hanged for crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to release the manuscript, announced by the Justice
Ministry, followed a demand by Eichmann's children that the prison
diary be made public as well as repeated requests by Israeli
scholars and journalists to see the manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition was originally voiced by, among others, Amos Hausner,
the son of Gideon Hausner, the lawyer who prosecuted Eichmann in
the four-month trial that captivated the nation and the world when
it started in May 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns have been expressed in Israel that the memoirs, in
which Eichmann repeated his defense at the trial that he did not
play an important role in the ``Final Solution'' to kill European
Jewry, would be used by neo-Nazis to deny the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   But scholars who actually have read parts of the manuscript say
it is a largely uninteresting document that will be of no use to
revisionist historians trying to claim that six million Jews were
not murdered or that the Nazis were not responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a boring monotone where a criminal is trying to justify
his actions,'' said Holocaust scholar and retired Hebrew University
professor Yehuda Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his memoirs Eichmann does talk about the mass murder of the
Jews, he just says he was not responsible,'' said Bauer, who has
read portions of the manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II Eichmann, an SS lieutenant colonel, was
responsible for organizing the transport of Jews to death camps and
promoted the use of gas chambers for their extermination.
</P>
<P>
   After the war he fled to Buenos Aires, where he lived until
Mossad agents tracked him down and abducted him in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Following Eichmann's execution in May 1962, prosecuting attorney
Hausner said releasing Eichmann's manuscript would only give the
war criminal, who told his side of the story at the trial, another
chance to dispute the verdict. Then Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion
agreed and ordered Eichmann's memoirs sealed in the state archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision then was understandable but that was many years
ago, when the verdict was still new,'' said journalist and
historian Tom Segev, who has repeatedly applied to see the
manuscript and was always turned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what's absurd now is why they just don't make it public
right away. Instead it is still being treated as if it is something
that can harm the national interests of the Jewish people,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Ministry, which announced the decision Tuesday, said
the memoir would be released as ``soon as possible'' once various
issues were resolved including the legal question of who actually
owns it.
</P>
<P>
   Under the decision reached Sunday at a meeting of Justice
Ministry officials and Holocaust scholars, the manuscript will be
published in a scholarly edition put out by German experts in the
field who will add commentary and footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, no part of the manuscript will be made available to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The manuscript is of general interest and of course it's
Eichmann's point of view and there's nothing new in it,'' said
state archivist Evyatar Friesel, who has read parts of the
manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it belongs to the whole body of literature on the issue
and as such should be open to the public,'' he said.

   TEL AVIV _ A Palestinian on a suicide mission rammed his car
into a group of Israeli soldiers Tuesday, wounding 11 people before
being shot to death by other soldiers and police.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials, in a marked change from previous responses to
attacks by Palestinian militants, did not personally blame
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat or threaten to halt the peace
process over the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we can expect that those organizations that
oppose the peace process will try to derail it at a moment when it
starts to gain momentum, which is now,'' said Deputy Defense
Minister Ephraim Sneh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the Palestinian Authority and our security services
will do their most to contain this _ so far, there is no doubt they
(Palestinian security services) are trying their best,'' Sneh told
Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak called the attack ``cowardly'' but
added that Israel would work together with the Palestinian
Authority to ``put an end to terror.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack was the second in as many weeks. The militant group
Hamas claimed responsibility for a shooting Aug. 3 in which two
Jewish settlers were wounded in Hebron, where about 400 Jews live
in a heavily-guarded section of the West Bank town.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's attack began, Israeli police said, when a Palestinian
in a Fiat with Israeli license plates drove into a group of
soldiers waiting beside the highway halfway between Tel Aviv and
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said that 10 minutes after the man drove away, he
returned and again plowed into the soldiers, who had been joined by
police and others assisting those initially wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fled and then the car returned to the site and tried to hit
soldiers again, and police and soldiers at the spot fired at the
car,'' said Linda Menuchin, a police spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Menuchin refused to give the assailant's name, saying police
were still investigating, but Israel Radio and others identified
him as Akram Alkam, 22, from the West Bank town of Bethlehem. Most
of Bethlehem is under Palestinian self-rule.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Fadwa Alkam, said her son had called her from a
mobile phone just before the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `I am at a junction about to carry out a suicide
attack, and I see a lot of soldiers,' '' his mother quoted him as
saying. ``I begged him not to do it, but he wouldn't listen, and
hung up the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   She said he wasn't a militant but had just finished a biography
of Hamas chief Yehiyeh Ayyash, slain in 1996 in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 11 soldiers were wounded but by the end of the day
only four remained in hospital, one in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   The attack comes at a time when Israel and the Palestinians are
in dispute over the next transfer of West Bank land to Palestinian
rule. Barak has said he will carry out the Wye accords, signed by
his predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu, but he has asked the
Palestinians to accept a delay in the next land transfer and put
off the last until negotiations start on a final peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   His request has raised accusations from Palestinians officials
that Israel is trying to wriggle out of handing over more of the
West Bank _ occupied by Israel in the 1967 war _ to Palestinian
self-rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the more Barak procrastinates _ the more he leaves the
process open to violence from both sides,'' said Hanan Ashrawi, a
member of the Palestinian Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat did reluctantly agree to Barak's proposal that the next
land transfer be carried out around Oct. 1, but he has so far
refused to accept any further delay in the last of the
redeployments mandated by the Wye accords.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between the two leaders already has caused US
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright to delay her planned visit
to the region. The Israeli premier asked her to put off her trip _
originally planned to start Aug. 14 _ until he and Arafat settled
their differences.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ After the sun has set and he is finished watering
his rooftop garden, 89-year-old John Pente beams down upon the
fresh life that has come to the aging streets of his beloved Little
Italy: An al fresco specialty from the Old Country, an open-air
movie, flashes onto the parking lot wall of Da Mimmo's restaurant,
proudly projected from a bedroom window of Pente's row house.
</P>
<P>
   Three stories below in the street, hundreds of people gather
with their lawn chairs for the free showings, silently engrossed in
the movie but for the occasional crunch of the cannoli distributed
free from Vaccaro's bakery. In sweet escape, they take in ``La
Strada'' and ``Rocky'' and, even more, the old neighborhood
darkness that flashes with fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come out and sit, turn the streets lights off and
everybody gets down to earth,'' Pente said, delighted to see all
the visiting children enlivening the streets once more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ci vediamo al cinema!'' (``See you at the movies!'') has
become the homespun prescription here in Little Italy every Friday
night this summer.
</P>
<P>
   A nettlesome civic issue _ what to do about that blank billboard
wall in the parking lot _ has been turned into a word-of-mouth
triumph, with more than 800 people settling down in the middle of
South High Street every Friday and staring up at the fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of it when I was visiting my sister-in-law in
Palermo last year,'' explained Mary Ann Cricchio, a dynamic young
restaurateur who grew up in Little Italy and still lives there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked and saw the big social event in Sicily,'' she said,
``all these people sitting in the piazza watching movies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bedroom of Mr. John, as Pente is widely known, the
aluminum storm window is popped out before each showing. But
otherwise things are untouched, from the wall crucifix to the
neatly made twin beds of his two sons, who moved out decades ago.
During those decades, Little Italy has been reduced largely to the
entrenched old people and to the 16 busy Italian restaurants that
still anchor the century-old enclave.
</P>
<P>
   A huge 16-millimeter, 2,000-watt projection machine has been set
up in the bedroom for the duration of the 10-week program, which
ends on Sept. 3 with ``Cinema Paradiso,'' a poetic choice about the
love of movies in a small Italian town.
</P>
<P>
   In the final minutes before the beginning of the latest
offering, ``The Name of the Rose,'' Maria Monaldi Oma, in from the
suburbs with her family, stood exultantly on the streets where she
spent the first 30 of her 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense of community _ that's one thing I miss,'' she said,
recalling life as one of seven children in a three-generation row
house. ``The movie idea is great. It brings the old people back out
into the streets, me and my old friends return, and the tourists
come in,'' she said as her brother, Frank, came over after testing
his old finesse in the Stiles Street bocce court.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As they settled under the starry sky, a hurdy-gurdy resurrected
for the occasion spieled old immigrant tunes. ``That's Peggy
O'Neil'' plunked forth lyrically as the late arrivals searched out
their spots in a buzz of family imprecations. (``Angie! Over
here!'')
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A feverishly busy man, Tom Kiefaber, lugged forth two big sacks
of boxed popcorn for curbside distribution. Then Kiefaber,
proprietor of Baltimore's historic Senator Theater, hurried up into
the Pente bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is full circle for my family,'' Kiefaber said, describing
how his grandfather had started the family's movie-theater dynasty
by showing open-air silent films to packs of world-weary
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Doubtful at first about the Little Italy venture, Kiefaber
yielded when he saw the street setting's simple beauty. He put word
out on his web site (www.senator.com), and now he and the Little
Italy Restaurant Association have agreed to underwrite another 10
films next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Up in the bedroom, Ms. Cricchio had a last-minute conference
with Kiefaber about the sensitive subject of prevailing
neighborhood standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sex scene between the monk and the Italian peasant girl?
_ I checked, and Father Mike said it was OK; it was art,'' Ms.
Cricchio said with some doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I already cut that scene,'' Kiefaber announced, wary
about the family-values throng buzzing down in the street and the
respect owed to Mr. John.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. John, a polite, elfin man, seemed far too delighted at
seeing the streets so crowded with real people to care about
full-frontal figments on the parking-lot wall. ``I'd do anything
for the neighborhood,'' he reassured one and all.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mr. John has refused all payment for his help. But the
restaurants, prizing his cooperation, have given him a handsome
heavy sidewalk bench, and they secretly plan to pay his utility
bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy life and love to cook,'' he said of his other weekly
pleasure, the repasts he makes on Sundays for a dozen family
visitors. ``My sister Rose, next door, she's 85 and doesn't come
out for the movies. She's traditional. She cooks special dishes at
different times of the year, knocks on my window and passes me the
food.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. John offered a smile of happiness worthy of a Fellini extra.
Then he headed down to his new movie-watching bench in the old
neighborhood. Seated as one of many once more in Little Italy, Mr.
John gazed across at the wall and waited for the movie to shine
forth from his upstairs window.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The U.N. mission in Kosovo is finally
moving to establish its authority here as the province's
government, to try to fill the vacuum exploited by the Kosovo
Liberation Army and those acting in its name.
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.N. officials admit that they are now in a period of
testing and challenging the KLA and its political and military
leaders. But they are also eager not to act like an imperial power
or to drive the KLA into opposition.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Bernard Kouchner, the chief U.N. administrator in
Kosovo and the province's effective czar, says he wants to pull the
KLA and others into the exercise of power. He will offer to provide
them a share of executive responsibility, through a Transitional
Council that will meet next week.
</P>
<P>
   To the same end, Kouchner said he intends to organize
supervised, province-wide elections for a provisional parliament as
early as April, much earlier than some in the international
bureaucracy desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in southern Sudan. We don't have to teach people
here how to vote,'' Kouchner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they campaigned and voted underground under Slobodan
Milosevic, they can certainly campaign openly,'' he added,
referring to the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has convincing answers about how to give quick
security and confidence to the 20,000 to 25,000 Serbs remaining in
Kosovo _ other than to concentrate them in protected enclaves _ let
alone how to entice the 160,000 or so Serbs who have fled over the
last year to return.
</P>
<P>
   While the United Nations has been very slow to get started, the
organization and the international peacekeepers have concentrated
in the last week on actions intended to symbolize the exercise of
real authority.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers have raided the headquarters of the KLA's
shadowy Ministry of Public Order, seizing weapons, cash and
unauthorized ``police'' identity cards, and temporarily arresting
its ``minister,'' Rexhep Selimi, as well as KLA Chief of Staff Agim
Ceku, for carrying guns illegally or without required
documentation.
</P>
<P>
   Some provisional mayors appointed by the KLA have been fired by
U.N.-appointed mayors, and the U.N. has put a few hundred
international police officers, mostly borrowed temporarily from
Bosnia, onto the streets of Pristina, with more permanent police to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   As important, the U.N. administrators have begun to pay city
workers, including judges, nearly all of whom have not had any
salary since February or March. This week, in a display that should
have an impact among ordinary Albanians, the U.N. intends to pull
up to Pristina Hospital with a truck full of money and cashiers,
protected by KFOR troops, and start paying doctors, nurses and
other medical staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission is to get some stable measures of self-government
here to deliver services, in a preferably democratic and
prayerfully multiethnic way,'' said a senior U.N. official.
``People need to see their government working.''
</P>
<P>
   That many Serbs would flee Kosovo was inevitable after such a
bitter, personal and nasty conflict, which really began early in
1998. But officials now admit that KFOR's main concern was to
protect its soldiers and the returning Albanians from the Serbs,
and that little thought was given to the protection of innocent
Serbs or Gypsies from revenge or even the quick arrest and
punishment of guilty Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``To really protect Kosovo as a multiethnic state _ in other
words, to provide security for the Serbs who wanted to stay _ would
have meant rapid ghettoization behind protected lines,'' a senior
official said. ``No one was prepared to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But with an apparently organized campaign by the Kosovo
Liberation Army to drive Serbs out of Kosovo, a pattern of
protected enclaves, like in Orahovac, Kosovska Mitrovica and
Gracanica, has become KFOR's only answer. But the troops appear to
have a new determination, as evidenced by the stiff French response
to Albanian demonstrations, organized over the weekend by local KLA
leaders, against Serbs in Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle to tame and co-opt the Kosovo Liberation Army,
which moved quickly to seize municipal buildings and set up
provisional authorities, however weak, is intensifying. While
Kouchner does not recognize the so-called provisional government
led by KLA political leader Hashim Thaci, 29, he needs Thaci's
support, or at least his forbearance.
</P>
<P>
   But international officials are disturbed by the KLA's attempts
to drive out the remaining Serbs; attack and harass KFOR troops,
especially the Russians, who are perceived as Serbian allies; seize
property, businesses and impose taxes; intimidate other Albanian
politicians, especially those belonging to the Democratic League of
Kosovo, the party of Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist whom Thaci is
trying to supplant as Kosovo's leader apparent.
</P>
<P>
   While Thaci is quick to say the right words in public when
pressed, numerous senior U.N. officials believe that the words are
too often hollow. And many of them resent the prominence given to
Thaci by the Clinton administration, especially Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and her close aide and spokesman, James Rubin,
who has taken on Thaci as a sort of project.
</P>
<P>
   They also resent the American decision to write a loose
paragraph into a demilitarization agreement with Thaci that
promises the creation in Kosovo, sometime, of a form of ``national
guard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a really, really long way away,'' one official
said. ``The KLA has got to transform itself or atomize.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thaci does not control the entire KLA, the same officials
acknowledge, and certainly not its chief of staff, Agim Ceku, who
is trying to preserve the status of the KLA as a military entity
despite KFOR's insistence that the KLA completely demilitarize by
Sept. 19.

</P>
<P>
   ``The honeymoon could be close to the end,'' Kouchner said.
``But we are not here to dominate the people of Kosovo or to
compete with them, or the honeymoon really will end.''
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner prefers to believe in Thaci's good faith. ``I believe
strongly that Thaci himself is in favor of a multiparty,
multiethnic democracy, but that some in the KLA are not,'' Kouchner
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are some, he said, who want confrontation and a Kosovo
purged of its Serbs, ``and there are those who want mafia and crime
and extortion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a race,'' Kouchner said, ``and we must win that
race.''
</P>
<P>
   And the way to do it, he is convinced, is to provide a share of
executive power and a rapid democratic franchise to all the people
of Kosovo, to occupy them with the common interest and their own
political interests.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At heart, of course, is the basic problem of Kosovo's future:
the KLA as well as Rugova are committed to independence, while the
United Nations and the West are committed to keeping Kosovo at
least formally within Yugoslavia's sovereignty, but with ``the
highest possible degree of autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   As late as 12 days ago, officials said, Thaci thought seriously
of ignoring Kouchner and the United Nations or working around him.
But Western leaders _ including Albright and British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, who both visited Kosovo _ ``made it very clear to Thaci
that he had to deal with Kouchner and the United Nations,'' one
official said.
</P>
<P>
   What Kouchner has in mind will start with a meeting next week of
a Transitional Council, on which sit representatives of all the
main parties and ethnic groups in Kosovo. Kouchner succeeded in
getting both Rugova and Thaci to agree to attend. Kouchner will
offer them rapid opportunities to move from a strictly advisory
role to a share of executive power, so long as they work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for these guys to put issues on the table and
hold themselves accountable for what they've done and not done,
said and not said,'' explained a senior U.N. official.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner said: ``I don't know if I will succeed, but I want to
give executive power quickly to the people and not just advisory
power, of course under my supervision,'' he said, with a U.N. veto.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Early elections, he said, would be for a provisional government
and parliament that would still work under the United Nations, but
which would also write a form of constitution for Kosovo. Under
that document, further elections would be held for truly
self-governing institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Early elections would also push Thaci toward electoral politics
and to start his own political party, which he is said to be
considering. But there are concerns about how to keep such
elections free, fair and without intimidation, while limiting
campaign spending from Kosovars in exile like Bujar Bukoshi, who
has started a newspaper in Pristina and who is said to control as
much as $290 million in funds tithed from overseas Albanian
Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite all their plans, senior officials, some of them in
Kosovo for just a few weeks, admit that the United Nations has been
slow out of the blocks and is responsible for some of its own
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Even among moderate Albanians, still in the happy flush of
victory, there is annoyance and criticism of the United Nations.
``Facts on the ground are what matters,'' said Agron Bajrami, the
deputy editor in chief of Koha Ditore, the best Albanian-language
paper and owned by politician-in-waiting Veton Surroi.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's lots of talk about the KLA filling the vacuum, but who
created the vacuum in the first place?'' Bajrami asked. ``If you
don't have police, some will try to create them, or a lot of gangs
will pretend to be police. I understand the problems, but the U.N.
has to act faster. They are responsible for creating a safe and
secure environment for people, and people here want that most of
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone now claims to have fought with the KLA, Bajrami said,
and ``uses that to take over restaurants or whatever.'' Still, he
said, ``I've seen few facts that directly link the KLA to this.''
</P>
<P>
   This is still a post-war Kosovo, not a peacetime Kosovo, he
said, and ``these things are bound to happen, and with the borders
to Albania open, I expected it to be even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bajrami said, it's unfair to ask Thaci ``to deliver
security while not allowing the KLA to create a legal force.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he said, it is difficult for the fighters who
were extravagantly praised by NATO for their role in the war ``to
then be told to disband and go away.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of Albanians, former fighters and ordinary
people, who want to contribute to the building of a new society,
Bajrami said. And he urged the U.N. mission to draw on them as
quickly as possible, to channel them into productive pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Kouchner wants to do. ``I want the United Nations
for maybe the first time to be considered as a friend, and not as
foreigners or people from another planet,'' he said. ``I am not
their enemy. We are not an occupying army, but it would be very
easy to transform the presence of military forces into an
occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, another senior official said: ``It is vital to make it
clear that the U.N. is the sole authority here, while understanding
that there is only a thin line between that and turning the KLA
into an opposition.''

 &HT;    Coke seeking former commercial actors for residual checks
 &HT;    By Shannon Shelton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Calling all extras!
</P>
<P>
   If you were ever lucky enough to have appeared in a Coca-Cola TV
ad, there might be a check with your name on it.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Co. and the Screen Actors Guild are looking for more
than 180 performers who appeared in Coke ads between 1953 and 1995,
and are owed residuals.
</P>
<P>
   Some actors have been easy to find, like football great ``Mean''
Joe Greene, who appeared in a well-known 1985 commercial.
</P>
<P>
   But others who played more minor roles have been more difficult
to track down. Depending on the contract, their checks could range
from $50 to $2,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   The problem arose in 1996 when Coke began running old ads in its
World of Coca-Cola attractions in Atlanta and Las Vegas, and at its
Everything Coca-Cola retail store in New York. An actor complained
to the Screen Actors Guild about not being paid.
</P>
<P>
   The guild stepped in to help work out the current agreement with
Big Red.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's attempts to locate all the performers failed. The
company then handed an undisclosed sum to the guild, which is
leading the search.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do our best to locate them,'' said Susan
McDermott, a Coke spokeswoman. ``Some of these people could be
living in another country.''
</P>
<P>
   Or some might not be living at all.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, survivors can claim the money if they can prove
their loved one was in one of the TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, the money will revert to a Screen Actors
Guild Foundation fund, said group spokeswoman Jayne Wallace. But
she added the union will do its best to find each person.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you're one of the chosen few, call the guild at
212-827-1540, or e-mail the group at ebates(at)sag.org

ROBERT M. VILES, 60; WAS KEY TO LAW SCHOOL'S SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Wife, Bruce Earman Viles, is cq.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Marshall Viles, former dean of Franklin Pierce Law Center
in Concord, N.H., the country's smallest independent law school,
died Mondaywhile vacationing in France.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Viles, a champion of ``community lawyering,'' apparently
drowned while swimming with his wife off the coast of Brittany. He
was 60.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to teaching courses on contract law, poverty law,
and social legislation, he cultivated the law center's growing
reputation in intellectual property law and public interest law,
particularly in underserved communities, which he called
``community lawyering.''
</P>
<P>
   The law school, with little more than 400 students, has been
ranked first in intellectual property law by US News and World
Report for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be seen as a jewel of a law school,'' Mr. Viles
said in a story published in the Globe on Aug. 24, 1997. ``What is
unique _ as Harry Truman would say _ is that in a small school, the
buck stops here. It doesn't stop somewhere over there in the
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about preparing someone so he or she knows how to
counsel a client, to give advice,'' he said. ``We want our students
to be able to do that . . . Relatively few law schools have devoted
full attention to developing students who are one step from having
professional responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Viles was born in Skowhegan, Maine. He graduated from Bates
College, New York University School of Law, and Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in New Hampshire in 1973 to become associate dean of
the law center at Franklin Pierce College. In 1976, when the law
center severed its ties with the college, Mr. Viles became its
dean. He held the post for the next 20 years and, in 1992, also
became the school's president. Last month, he became vice chairman
of the school's board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Douglas J. Wood, a former student and current chairman
of the school's board of trustees, said of Viles: ``His vision,
creativity, hard work, and caring for faculty and students alike
brought this school from its infancy to its current national, and
even international reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Bruce Earman Viles.

THE BUMP IN A MIDSUMMER NIGHT: IS IT A DREAM?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 William Harris' most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about
the dancer-choreographer John Jasperse.  
 By WILLIAM HARRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every Thursday night since January, cognoscenti have
been flocking to a sassy dance-theater performance at the Pyramid
Club in Manhattan's East Village. ``The Donkey Show,'' conceived by
Randy Weiner and directed by Weiner and his wife, Diane Paulus, is
an adaptation of Shakespeare's ``Midsummer Night's Dream'' as
interpreted through the lyrics of disco music and the dances these
catchy tunes inspired, including the hustle, the bump and the
freak.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography was created by the company under the
supervision of Ms. Paulus, who danced with the New York City Ballet
as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Now this production is transferring to El Flamingo, a larger
club in Manhattan, with the help of Jordan Roth, 23, the son of the
veteran impresario Daryl Roth (currently represented by ``De la
Guarda'' and ``Wit'') and MAC Cosmetics, in its first theatrical
venture.
</P>
<P>
   The show is to open on Wednesday, with previews through the
previous week. Six days a week audiences can join the dancing, both
before and after the 55-minute performance, as well as sip
cocktails throughout. Tickets are $25.
</P>
<P>
   There is no dialogue in the show, but lots of cross-dressing,
lip-synching and polyester. In other words, something for everyone.
People who know the play will be struck by the way vintage disco
hits like ``Don't Leave Me This Way'' (sung by Thelma Houston,
1977), ``Enough Is Enough'' (Barbra Streisand and Donna Summer,
1979) or ``You Sexy Thing'' (Hot Chocolate, 1975) are used to
amplify the story of two couples unhappy in love and caught in the
cross hairs of the feuding Oberon and Titania, the king and queen
of the fairies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Shakespeare is all about passion and sex and drugs, just
like disco in the late 1970s,'' said Weiner, who has previously
re-examined ``Twelfth Night'' through the filter of pop music. ``I
love the metaphor in `Midsummer' of putting a drop of something in
someone's eyes and it instantly changes the world. It also dawned
on me that this is really a story about bestiality. I'm interested
in the tension between the hot music and the play's darker
images.'' Weiner, 34, and Ms. Paulus, 33, Manhattan natives, met in
a high school production of ``Wonderful Town'' 17 years ago. They
subsequently attended Harvard University, where they frequently
sneaked into the American Repertory Theater to see productions by
experimental directors like Robert Wilson, JoAnne Akalaitis and
Andrei Serban.
</P>
<P>
   However, both cite the comic actor-playwright-director Charles
Ludlam, founder of the Ridiculous Theatrical Company, as their
principal influence. In 1993, they founded the Project 400 Theater
Group, a populist New York troupe devoted to musical- and
community-based performance.
</P>
<P>
   Two more people have been added to the original 11-member cast
of ``The Donkey Show,'' and the design elements have been
sharpened.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the underground mentality of the event and the sense that
the show happens out of the organic life of a club is untouched,''
Ms. Paulus said. ``People came to us wanting to work on the show,
which is how this company was assembled. They are all highly
physical, but I would not call any of them dancers. I also think
anyone who wants to be a performer can be.''

 &HT;    Artist's condo captures mood and style one layer at a time
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Aug. 12.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When friends see Bobby Sikes' renovated condo for the
first time, their first reaction, he says, is ``Where's your
artwork?''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta artist and interior designer has made a name for
himself with his paintings, murals and faux wall finishes, so they
expect to see far more than the couple of pieces gracing its walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want this place to feel decorated, but like a home,''
he says of the simple yet elegant approach he's taken to the
Midtown unit he bought last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a closer look reveals subtle touches of Sikes' brush. He
finished the walls in an aged plaster texture in warm shades of
light gold and gray. He marbleized a pair of columns in similar
neutral tones yet made them pop with metallic gold accents. He used
the columns to draw the eye to the ceiling where he created a mural
of pale blue sky and white wispy clouds. (He even faux painted its
ceiling fan in the same parchment finish he created on other
ceilings in the unit). And in the foyer, he painted an arched mural
with a beckoning view of neighboring Piedmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of selecting one decorative wall finish, let alone
several, from the array of options these days can be enough to send
some homeowners running to the comfort of a gallon of white latex.
Fear of faux _ that broad category of paint and textural finishes,
from sponging to ragging to trompe l'oeil _ and its ``permanent''
nature discourage many from experimenting with a look that, unlike
paint or wallpaper, is timeless and original.
</P>
<P>
   ``On average, people are afraid of color, and with textured
finishes, it's pretty much there to stay so they need to be sure
they select the color they want,'' said Atlanta artist and author
Phillip Myer of PCM Studios, a decorative painting business. ``It's
hard to get people over the hurdle that color shouldn't be
frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason recent trends in faux finishes have moved away
from the bold colors of the '80s to the tone-on-tone neutrals of
the '90s. Busy sponged effects have evolved into stuccoed and
distressed surfaces that offer the high contrast that variations in
color had provided. The result is subtle refinement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at walls as the backdrops for artwork or for playing up
fabrics _ not as a statement in themselves,'' Sikes says. ``I also
think of things in a timeless sense, instead of finishes that are
trendy and will look dated in a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Both views are evident inside his own place.
</P>
<P>
   All in the details
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old, known for his traditional oil paintings, had
been living in a colonial home in metro Atlanta near his studio and
fine art print business, Bobby Sikes Fine Art &AMP; Design, when he
decided to move closer in. Ironically, the two-bedroom unit, at
Piedmont Road and 13th Street, had been owned twice by artists.
</P>
<P>
   Renovation was nothing new for Sikes, who with sister Susan
Davis, also co-owns a Lawrenceville (Ga.) design business founded
by their mother, the late Faye Sikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never done a project like this before,'' he says of the
84-year-old building. ``I do it for clients all the time, but doing
it for yourself is another story. But it was a good renovation for
me because it involved no exterior.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-floor unit is among 12 in the gray brick building
nestled among sought-after high-rise condos near the park entrance.
Because of the long, narrow layout, Sikes added vertical elements
to offset the design _ the columns separating the living room from
a small sun room overlooking the park, the living room's sky mural
painted inside a tray ceiling, the foyer's tall trompe l'oeil
surrounded by faux stone walls. He replaced standard hallway doors
with French ones containing panes of beveled mirrors, which,
because of their reflections, make the space appear wider.
</P>
<P>
   Sikes gutted a cold kitchen of pale blue walls and simple white
cabinets to create a warm European setting of earthy granite
countertops and limestone tile, new cabinets in a distressed,
oatmeal finish and walls in more of the Venetian texture, a mix of
paint and plaster.
</P>
<P>
   The two bathrooms also were gutted and now contain one of the
home's most interesting accents. Set into the marble wall tile
above the tubs are plaster friezes the artists painted look aged,
creating a patina to match the tile.
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of detail, combined with the murals and textured
walls, that gives homes a unique sense of character, says the
artist, whose current projects include the Fayetteville home of
boxer Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   But Sikes cautions: Just don't overdo it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do every room faux,'' he says, ``but I look at it like
a wardrobe in that everybody needs to strike a balance between
solids and patterns. I tend to do a lot more solid and in one
color.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating something unique
</P>
<P>
   The artist, who began painting professionally only seven years
ago after managing his father's car dealership, has done murals and
wall finishes for everything from banks and office buildings to
funeral homes and apartments. But Sikes, who studied both art and
marketing at the University of Georgia, says his most exciting
project has been his condo, a renovation that took about seven
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the fact that I didn't have anyone else to answer to
but myself,'' he says. ``The most exciting things to do _ and the
ones that bring the best results _ are ones in which the client
gives me the freedom to create and doesn't dictate something they
may have seen elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many faux artists first create sample boards of the
finishes they plan to use, Sikes prefers to start with the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's developed such a reputation for doing color so well he
doesn't need to do the boards,'' says Alpharetta resident Paul
Maggard, for whom Sikes is doing painting several rooms. ``He can
do something to a wall, and if you want him to modify it he can.''
</P>
<P>
   The look's random quality is what appeals to Maggard most about
paint and textural finishes. ``It's just so much more dramatic than
wallpaper, a real art form that gives you something timeless,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   And, as eclectic European interiors continue to influence
American decor, consumers are drawn to the juxtaposition of fine
surfaces with rough ones, contemporary art with antique furniture,
the new with the old. When it comes to walls, Myer says, ``it's the
imperfection they're after.''
</P>
<P>
   Faux finishes also give homeowners something unique _ a
large-scale work of art. ``I like something in our home that you
don't walk down the block and see in someone else's place,''
Maggard says.
</P>
<P>
   Not even in Sikes'.

IT'S BUSINESS IN SPANISH ONLY FOR TEXAS TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL CENIZO, Texas _ Leaders of this rugged town on the banks of
the Rio Grande on Tuesday defended an ordinance that requires all
local government business to be transacted in Spanish, and another
law that calls for firing any municipal employee who helps the
Border Patrol apprehend illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial ordinances are rooted in El Cenizo's Mexican
immigrant heritage, even though it has not been part of Mexico for
150 years.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said that while there are no plans to
challenge the new ordinances, they note a 1996 federal law
prohibits cities from stopping their employees from assisting
immigration authorities.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to find a non-Spanish speaker in this town of about
1,500 people, located in Webb County 10 miles south of Laredo.
Nearly everyone has either come from Mexico, is married to an
immigrant or is the child of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and one of two city commissioners came to the United
States from Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, as illegal immigrants. They are
now U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President (Al) Gore and Governor (George W.) Bush are
campaigning in Spanish because they know it is important. They want
the vote,'' Mayor Rafael Rodriguez said Tuesday as American and
Mexican flags hung behind him on the wall at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to come here and learn Spanish,'' said Rodriguez,
who speaks no English.
</P>
<P>
   He said the push for the two ordinances was prompted by
residents' apathy toward government and the Border Patrol policy of
searching buses linking El Cenizo, with its low-slung shacks and
many unpaved streets, with nearby Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Schultz, spokesman for the Washington-based U.S. English, a
group that wants to make English the official language of the
United States, said El Cenizo's stance flies in the face of a
common language holding together the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We essentially predicted we would have a dropping out _ a
linguistic ghettoization of the country,'' Schultz said. ``We did
not know it would happen this soon.''
</P>
<P>
   But Israel M. Reyna, the lead attorney for Texas Rural Legal Aid
in Laredo, said city leaders are doing what they can in a place
where many people have limited English skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a developing democracy opening government's doors to the
people,'' Reyna said of the language ordinance. ``Getting people
involved is the primary mission.''
</P>
<P>
   El Cenizo, which started as a housing development without water
or electricity, was incorporated in 1989, but it still faces many
conditions reminiscent of a developing nation.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders _ the two commissioners and the mayor _ approved
the two controversial ordinances last week.
</P>
<P>
   One ordinance requires that City Council sessions and other
official functions be conducted in Spanish and that notices will be
posted in Spanish. English translations will be provided with 48
hours' notice.
</P>
<P>
   To conform with state and federal regulations, ordinances will
be created in English but will be translated into Spanish,
according to city documents.
</P>
<P>
   The second ordinance declares El Cenizo a ``safe haven'' for
undocumented immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   As such, all town employees and elected officials are forbidden
under the penalty of dismissal, from assisting the Border Patrol,
according to the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not fighting the government; we are expressing our
feelings,'' City Commissioner Gloria Romo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it is their job to go after illegals, but it is not
right to bother people who are legal,'' Romo said.
</P>

 &HT;    Electric R.E.M. kicks off U.S. tour in top form
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's been a California dream the last few days for
R.E.M., the Athens supergroup kicking off its first American tour
in four years with two soldout shows here.
</P>
<P>
   They've dedicated songs to Beach Boy Brian Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Their entourage is spread out in a series of Hollywood hotels,
from the John Belushi deathpad _ the Chateau Marmont _ to the
chi-chi Beverly Hills Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Conducting some Hollywood business, band members went to Warner
Brothers to hear the soundtrack for the upcoming Jim Carrey movie
about Andy Kaufman, a film that takes its title from ``Man on the
Moon,'' R.E.M.'s irresistible hit about the over-the-top comedian.
(In concert, Stipe dedicated the song ``Man On the Moon'' to ``my
friend Milos,'' referring to the movie's director, Milos Forman.)
</P>
<P>
   They've even had an audition, of sorts. Kathy Wetherell, a
producer with MTV's ``Road Rules,'' was at Monday's concert
checking out the music and hoping to convince the band to
participate in the show when it visits Atlanta in October.
</P>
<P>
   After months of playing European dates, R.E.M. is touring
America for the first time since 1995, heading for three soldout
shows at Chastain Park Aug. 29-31 in Atlanta. Judging from their
riveting performances here, the band has survived its midlife
crisis _ slowing album sales, the retirement of drummer Bill Berry
_ not only intact, but with a lively sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's show at the Greek Theater, lead singer Michael Stipe
poked fun at their latest image _ 40-year-old icons who are
sometimes criticized as being out of step with today's,
rage-oriented rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're probably the last band in the universe to have a
website,'' Stipe laughed as a bright blue URL address flashed on a
screen above his shaven head (www.remhq.com).
</P>
<P>
   Stipe also mocked his Rock God status a bit by halting the
encore performance of ``It's the End of the World As We Know It''
to break into a rambling, lyrically quirky version of Elvis
Presley's ``Suspicious Minds.''
</P>
<P>
   This superb musicianship and carefree has been casting a spell
on concertgoers, too. From the time fans began pulling their cars
into the dusty parking lots in the hills overlooking Hollywood to
the first chords of the opening song ``Lotus,'' R.E.M.'s shows have
had the look and feel of a school reunion. The crowds have been
mostly 30-something, dressed in the casual hip of off-duty
professionals ready to let down their guard. For the most part,
they've done just that, liberated by an energizing, 22-song set in
which R.E.M. ripped through 20 years of hits and new material with
the enthusiasm of teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   The shows are literally electric. The stage of the 5,000-seat,
outdoor amphitheater _ it looks much like Chastain Park with
bleachers _ was draped with intricate scaffolding holding hundreds
of brightly lighted, kitschy icons (coffee cup, smiling whale,
revolving video camera, big banana and giant yellow lotus) that
blinked on cue with the music. The band itself, back by three
supporting musicians, was in tight veteran form, with Stipe's
rubbery dancing and Mike Mills' ethereal backing vocals often
recalling the group's party days in Athens. Even guitarist Peter
Buck let fly some air kicks.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, R.E.M. has opted not to deliver a walk-through
performance of greatest hits. The band is playing plenty of
material off less commercially successful albums, such as 1996's
``New Adventures in Hi-Fi'' and this year's ``Up.'' Stipe
introduced the Dylan-esque ``E-Bow the Letter'' as his ``favorite
song ever.'' And, in a gesture that underscored a mood of ``we
ain't done yet,'' the band even unveiled the new tune ``Great
Beyond,'' which they wrote for the ``Man On the Moon'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the most poignant moment during the shows, Stipe
introduced the 1986 hit ``Fall on Me'' with a sweet nod of
nostalgia: ``This song is older than time,'' he said, raising his
arms up into the spotlight while pouring out the lyric ``lift your
arms up to the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Concertgoers, too, have noted R.E.M.'s efforts to remain vital
in a hip-hop universe, where relevant rock is a scarce musical
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't dug the last couple of albums all that much
because they were too mellow. I like my R.E.M. a little more
uptempo,'' said longtime fan Gary Poole, a 38-year-old music
industry exec. ``But, sure, they should always keep going. You can
still drink beer and rock at 40.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen-year-old Jonathan Yaffe drove from San Diego to see the
band because ``they offer so much more variety than other music of
today. They haven't sold out. They haven't altered their sound to
be on the radio. They aren't a fast flurry like Korn. They are more
about music than money.''
</P>
<P>
   Clutching his R.E.M. poster, Yaffe added, ``My advice to them
would be to keep touring. I mean, look at this place _ it's
packed.''
</P>

 &HT;    5 things to know when considering faux finishes
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Aug. 12
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cynthia Potter has to admit she was a little antsy about having
someone ``beat up'' her kitchen cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   But she and her husband, Peter Lasser, wanted to give the room a
Southwest look, and Atlanta artists Phillip Myer and Andy Jones
recommended refinishing the cabinets in an aged distressed look.
``We were leery about using the old cabinets, but they just beat
them and painted them,'' Potter says. ``We couldn't be more
pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiring artists to create decorative finishes, whether it's faux
painting a chair, texturizing a wall or creating trompe l'oeil,
requires a certain amount of trust. When you ask your hair stylist
to do ``something different,'' you're placing your head in someone
else's hands, aren't you?
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are steps consumers can take to ensure their choice in
painting techniques lives up to what they envisioned:
</P>
<P>
   Learn to speak the language: Get familiar with the dozens of
painting and texturizing techniques that make up decorative
painting. Most of the terms describe the look the artists try to
replicate, such as marbleizing, woodgraining and tortoiseshell. But
others, such as trompe l'oeil (the French term for ``fooling the
eye'' into believing that life-size painted objects are real), are
less obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, look at magazines and tear out pictures of things that
interest you,'' says Myer, who co-owns PCM Studios, a decorative
painting business, with Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have a feel for what you want, be warned: Decorative
painting has become a highly competitive field.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully select the artist: Ask friends and co-workers for
referrals. Then make sure your personality clicks with the
artist's; communication is key to a successful project.
</P>
<P>
   Ask to see the artist's portfolio to get a feel for his work.
``Ask to go and look at what they've done previously, too,'' Potter
says.
</P>
<P>
   Ask for sample boards or sketches: Once you narrow your choices
of finishes, most artists will create a sample board illustrating
the technique. If it's a mural you're commissioning, the artist
should provide sketches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spend a good bit of time in this process because you can
really prevent problems down the road with color and technique,''
Myer says. ``Pin the sample boards up in the room and look at them
at different times of day to see how they look under different
amounts of light.''
</P>
<P>
   (If you're building a new home, most artists prefer to get
involved early in the process to advise clients on selecting base
paints for
</P>
<P>
   finishes.)
</P>
<P>
   Expect the expense of something handmade: Charges for murals run
across the board, depending on size, subject matter and intricacy.
For paint and textural finishes, some artists charge by the hour,
others by the room or square footage. Atlanta artist Bobby Sikes'
fee is based on the technique and room size. The cost for painting
a parchment finish on the walls of a 12-foot-by-12-foot
dining-room, for example, range from about $750 to $950. (The fees
for creating sample boards are applied toward the cost.)
</P>
<P>
   ``On the whole, painting costs a little more than wallpaper, but
if a finish gets scuffed or scratched it can be touched up,'' Sikes
says.
</P>
<P>
   Wallpaper manufacturers have jumped on the faux bandwagon with
patterns that mimic finishes, providing a more affordable
alternative. ``If you want a look that's letter perfect, a
faux-finish wallpaper may be for you,'' Myer says. ``But if you
have imperfect walls that don't lend themselves to wallpaper, a
painted finish is the better option because it can hide those
imperfections.''
</P>
<P>
   The unique imperfection of paint is what draws most to faux
finishes. Like any other artwork, no two fauxed walls _ or rooms _
are exactly alike.
</P>
<P>
   Keep an open mind _ you can always change it later: Years from
now, what if you grow tired of the finish and want to make a
change? Walls done in a simple painting technique, such as
sponging, can be painted over, Myer says. But ones texturized with
heavier, three-dimensional finishes will need to be scraped and
sanded, or covered with a wallpaper liner, to be made smooth for
painting. (Or if it's just the color you want to change, textured
walls that have been glazed can be painted over.)
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, Potter says, is be willing to experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're open to new ideas, even though these finishes have
been around for a long time, the artist can take it from there,''
she says. ``At some point, you just have to trust them.''

   Decorative finishes include dozens of painting and texturing
techniques, so it helps to know the language when selecting one.

through the use of a wet paint glaze, brushes and special woodgrain

not to drive the army into opposition. To that end, says Bernard
Kouchner, the chief U.N. administrator in Kosovo, he wants to pull

AN ENTERTAINER, UNAPOLOGETICALLY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)  (af) 
 Barry Singer's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
Joe's Pub, a club at the Joseph Papp Public Theater.  
 By BARRY SINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Claiborne Cary has nothing to apologize for. In an age of
cabaret performance often practiced as some rarefied art form, she
is unabashedly an entertainer, one who likes to raise a ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   Rude jokes and raw schtick are in no way beneath her, and as a
singer Ms. Cary, now in her 60s, flat out likes to swing. All of
which leaves her on the contrarian fringe of today's cabaret
universe, where the notion of entertainment seems to get shunned
somehow as lacking in serious purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can get lonely,'' said Ms. Cary, who is in the midst of a
monthlong return engagement at the somewhat less than mainstream
Danny's Skylight Room in Manhattan. ``There aren't many people who
aspire to be fun anymore. Not in a serious way.''
</P>
<P>
   A two-time winner of New York cabaret scene's top honor, the MAC
Award, Ms. Cary is still a favorite within the industry but a name
popularly recognized only by a few. Since arriving in New York from
Lone Tree, Iowa in the 1950s as an aspiring dancer, she says has
most definitely ``been around'': singing and dancing on Broadway
and off and working the great cafes _ and also the not so great _
of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Barely more than five-feet tall, she nursed little hope
initially of making it as a Broadway chorus girl. Yet the
choreographer Bob Fosse cast Ms. Carey in 1957 for his new show
``New Girl in Town'' over the vehement objections of that
production's director, George Abbot.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were running up and down the aisle of the 46th Street
Theater, screaming at each other,'' Ms. Cary recalled recently over
lunch at a restaurant in Manhattan. ``Abbot wanted another
long-legged lady, but Bobby wanted me.''
</P>
<P>
   With characteristic capriciousness, however, Ms. Carey quit
dancing for good immediately after ``New Girl in Town'' closed. ``I
just didn't want to be in the chorus anymore,'' she said. ``I
started doing parts and singing; I'd always listened to singers,
especially Peggy Lee. Also Lee Wiley. And Anita O'Day.''
</P>
<P>
   At first there were gigs at tony Manhattan nightspots like the
Blue Angel and Julius Monk's Upstairs at the Downstairs. Then came
rock-and-roll and the near-death of cabaret in the 60s, followed by
voice-over work, commercials and television, as well as two
marriages and a son.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, some 10 years ago, Ms. Cary abandoned the city for Los
Angeles. ``A nasty little town,'' is all she will say about her
experience there. Her long-planned, permanent return to New York is
now imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, she remains an extraordinary amalgam of musicianship
and standup comedy: her pitch sure, her sense of time, both
musically and comedically, effortless. Though her voice possesses
the razorblade tone and ironic attack of an Elaine Stritch, her
singing can be surprisingly expansive, even lyrical.
</P>
<P>
   She shapes her sets into melodramatic narratives with
well-chosen song juxtapositions: Irving Berlin's ``Say It Isn't
So'' opposite John Wallowitch's ``I Live Alone Again''; Cy Coleman
and Joe McCarthy's ``Why Try to Change Me Now'' sung against Harold
Arlen and Ted Koehler's ``As Long as I Live.'' The potential effect
could be bathetic but rarely is; Ms. Cary's wit and sense of
survival bend the songs to her will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cut right to the bone,'' she said. ``I've learned that I'm
better being funny between songs, rather than just doing funny
songs; funny songs quickly get not so funny. Maybe that's another
reason I'm nowhere, though, professionally. I'm trying to swing and
be funny. Who else ever managed that?''
</P>
<P>
   On her latest CD, ``Claiborne Cary Live,'' she leads off
tackling George and Ira Gershwin's ``The Man I Love'' at a
ferocious clip. The result is not just exhilarating but revelatory.
``I used to sing all of these songs much more slowly,'' Ms. Cary
tells her audiences. ``But I had more time then.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I exist?'' she asks. ``Or, at least, subsist? I play a
lot of private parties. And I don't work much. That helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Her point is well taken. With few club owners these days paying
performers anything at all beyond a small percentage of the door,
the hard costs of cabaret _ salaries for musicians, up-front
expenditures for arrangements and advertising _ largely come out of
the singers' own pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to save up for these gigs,'' Ms. Cary said wearily.
``Let's face it, if I was looking to make a decent living, I'd have
gone into computers by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabaret's persistent inability to provide her with financial
security would surprise at least one person, Ms. Cary maintains.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother viewed show business as a sure guarantee of economic
freedom for her three daughters, both from the Depression and from
men. (One of Ms. Cary's sisters is the actress Cloris Leachman.)
</P>
<P>
   ```Maybe you'll have your own money someday,' Mother would
constantly say,'' Ms. Cary recalled. ```Maybe you won't have to get
married; maybe you'll just read and travel.' She'd call us in to
watch her scrub the floor. `Girls, come here and look,' she'd say.
`Don't ever do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' Ms. Cary added with the impeccable timing of a lifelong
entertainer, ``I never have.''

   New York magazine asked an array of New Yorkers who knew  &UR; JFK &LR; 
 &UR; Jr. &LR;  for their recollections of the fallen idol. Among the
respondents was  &UR; Venard Garvin &LR; , who was, according to a profile
describing his connection with the deceased, ``convicted of drug
possession in 1992 and sentenced to two to six years; his
prosecutor was John Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him in the courtroom,'' begins the reminiscence.
``Even though his job was to put me away, I liked the guy.'' The
account includes Garvin's recollection that the judge, annoyed by
all the attention the prosecutor was getting, scolded everyone in
court for staring.
</P>

   At recess, recalls the former defendant, ``I spoke to him. I

us to get to the next place, we need to have children in space,''
he said, in remarks quoted by the Billings (Mont.) Gazette and
forwarded by  &UR; Dwain Hanson &LR; .

<P>
   ``It's very difficult,'' said one unidentified astronaut who had
traveled in space with his significant other. ``Maybe it's
impossible. It's hard to keep in one place, and you keep floating
off in different directions.'' A harness invented in 1985 has been
patented, but not tried out in space, said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the different daily cycle _ in space, the sun rises
and sets every 45 minutes _ destroys the natural rhythms of
testosterone surges. The lack of gravity means that eggs don't drop
and sperm don't swim up; nor is a baby likely to drop through the
birth canal.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts typically develop ``fat face chicken leg syndrome,''
as a result of body fluids being pumped upward. ``If we go to
space,'' asked Brown, ``will we remain the same species? If we go
and stay, the children will be born in microgravity, and we better
figure out what that would look like. ... They may not look human,
they may not survive and they may not be able to return to Earth.''

MILITANTS DECLARE DAGESTAN INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Islamic militants greeted Russia's new acting prime
minister Vladimir Putin Tuesday by declaring independence for the
southern Russian republic of Dagestan, escalating the largest armed
uprising the Kremlin has faced since it lost a war against
separatists in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, appointed Monday after President Boris N. Yeltsin
abruptly dismissed the government of Sergei Stepashin, responded to
the insurgents' challenge by promising that Russian troops would
bring order to the Caucasus region ``in the shortest time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Putin's confident prediction was dimmed by the shadow of
Russia's failed two-year campaign against separatists in Chechnya,
where the Kremlin and the military repeatedly claimed success
against rebel fighters until the day in 1996 when federal troops
withdrew from the region in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Russian military reported success against the
militants in Dagestan Tuesday, signs appeared that the rebels have
no intention of leaving soon. Dagestani officials said that the
militants, estimated at several hundred to more than 1,000, were
well-trained and receiving supplies and reinforcement from across
the virtually unguarded frontier with Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military said Tuesday federal troops had succeeded
in pushing the rebels out of two villages on Dagestan's mountainous
border with Chechnya that the gunmen had occupied since Saturday.
The chairman of Russia's general staff, General Anatoly Kvashnin,
called the situation in Dagestan ``manageable.''
</P>
<P>
   But other reports said the guerrillas had taken control of
another village, this one a mile from Botlikh, the main town in the
mountain valley where fighting has raged. The reports said the
militants also shot down two helicopters, killing four Russian
pilots, including a colonel who had won the service's highest
military honor.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians also have been blamed for killing four Dagestani
police and wounding 17 in friendly fire (they have denied it) and
accidentally bombing a village in Georgia on the other side of the
Caucasus (also denied). On Monday, Kvashnin reportedly narrowly
escaped death himself when his helicopter came under mortar attack
as it was landing (the military denied this, too).
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994-96 Chechen war, Russia and the rebels often seemed
to be fighting two separate conflicts. The Russians would take
villages, while the guerrillas would move around at night, taking a
toll with quick attacks. Initial military reports here echoed the
optimistic Russian approach publicized throughout the war in
Chechnya, with accounts of the enemy being surrounded and villages
swiftly retaken by Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, who visited Dagestan the day before his firing, said
Russia would not repeat the mistakes of Chechnya and that no
soldiers or civilians would die. But local Dagestan officials urged
Moscow to use overwhelming force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are faced with a very dangerous and clever enemy that will
do anything to meet their objective,'' said Mukho Aliyev, the
speaker of Dagestan's parliament. ``The goal of the militants is to
rip Dagestan out of the Russian Federation and set up an Islamic
Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the message of a statement issued by a council of
Muslim leaders, or Shura, that declared an independent Muslim state
of Dagestan governed by Islamic rule. The council called on all
Dagestani Muslims to ``fight until all the infidels are ousted from
the Muslim territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Dagestani leaders quickly denied that the Shura existed, and
blamed the statement on the rebels' Chechen backers. Aliyev said
that despite the povery and unemployment plaguing Dagestan, most
people, aware that Chechnya is even more lawless, violent and
impoverished, do not want to ally with the breakaway region. But he
added that Dagestan is vulnerable and seconded outgoing premier
Stepashin's remark Monday that Russia ``could lose Dagestan.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Putin emerged from a meeting with Yeltsin and said
Moscow had a plan to ``normalize the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin opened yesteray's meeting with Putin by asking about his
mood. ``Combative,'' Putin responded in his usual terse style.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, who is in the last year of his term, announced Monday
that he sees Putin, a former KGB agent who before his appointment
headed Russia's security service, as his favored successor in
presidential elections set for the middle of next year. But first
he has to be approved by parliament next Monday, a vote that
analysts and politicians said could go either way.
</P>
<P>
   How Putin handles the situation in the Caucasus may decide his
fate. Television showed Putin being greeted by Yeltsin, who asked
about his mood. ``Ready for battle,'' Putin replied tersely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation there is normalizing, but the situation is still
complicated,'' Putin said. ``The job can be fulfilled and will be
fulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrasting with this image of unity and decisiveness were
contradictory reports from the ground in Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Since the rebels entered the region four days ago, Russian
officials have said their troops were preparing a full-scale
operation to push out the fighters. But as of Tuesday, only two
motor rifle brigades had been sent to the area of the fighting, the
newspaper Kommersant reported. At the moment, the insurgents were
faced by Dagestani police covered by military helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Special forces commandos should be fighting against these
well-trained militants, not police officers,'' said Aslanbekh
Aslakhanov, a former senior police official who now heads the
Russian Islamic Congress.
</P>
<P>
   General Viktor Kazantsev, arriving to take command of Russian
forces in Dagestan, said Russia was being cautious to avoid harming
civilians he said the militants were using as ``human shields.''
But Aliyev, the local parliament speaker, said the guerrillas had
no hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior Russian military officer, General Nikolai
Mikhailov, told the Interfax news agency that the situation in
Dagestan is different than the war in Chechnya because in the
current conflict, ``the people don't support'' the militants.
</P>
<P>
   But most Chechens in 1994 were against a war with Russia. Some
observers worry that the Dagestan conflict, handled the wrong way,
might lead to a new war.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this situation the biggest fear is a repeat of the
escalation that preceded the Chechen war, when the military, unable
to force the militants out of villages, launched massive airtrikes
against them, which led to numerous victims among the civilian
population,'' journalist Mirlad Fatullayev wrote in Nezavisimaya
Gazeta from Dagestan. ``Then the people joined the ranks of the
separatists.''

IN COURT DOCUMENTS, U.S. AND MICROSOFT SUBMIT THEIR VERSIONS OF
FACTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The witnesses have departed, but the paper wars
began Tuesday in the Microsoft antitrust trial as both sides
presented the court with book-sized documents detailing what each
camp believes are the facts of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The government and Microsoft Corp., not surprisingly, offered
the court two entirely different stories. They did that in person
in the courtroom beginning last October, but Tuesday's filings more
sharply delineate their arguments in painstaking detail, allegation
by allegation, witness by witness, e-mail by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The government alleges that Microsoft engaged in attempted
market collusion, illegally tying one product to another,
exclusionary dealing and predatory pricing. Microsoft replies that
the government may have succeeded in ``portraying Microsoft as an
aggressive company that occasionally engages in tough tactics,''
but that none of it rises to the level of an antitrust violation.
</P>
<P>
   The language of the documents is often even more emphatic than
was the courtroom rhetoric, suggesting a hardening of positions on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft assert that
the big software maker company has a ``powerful and well-entrenched
operating system monopoly'' with Windows, which controls the basic
operations of most personal computers. Microsoft counters that the
evidence in the case and the recent rise of new competitive threats
make it ``painfully obvious that Microsoft does not possess
monopoly power _ the ability to control prices or exclude
competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that taken together the mosaic of
Microsoft's misconduct amounts to ``a predatory campaign'' to
stifle competition from Internet software and restrict consumer
choice. ``In other words,'' the government said, ``Microsoft
prevented consumers from getting what they wanted so that Microsoft
could keep what it had _ a monopoly in operating systems.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Microsoft view, the government's consumer-harm claims are
the Achilles heel of the government's case. Microsoft says that its
entire business model is geared to creating ``improved products at
low prices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite vociferous complaints from a parade of Microsoft's
rivals, who obviously would prefer less vigorous competition,'' the
company declared, ``there was remarkably little evidence about the
impact of Microsoft's actions on consumers, who are, after all, the
intended beneficiaries of the antitrust laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Each such general statement is backed up by citation after
citation from the court record. The government's documents runs 774
pages, and Microsoft's 442 pages. Every Microsoft action and
dealing with another company _ America Online, Intel, Apple, IBM,
Sun Microsystems and others _ is reviewed by each side, point and
counterpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence cited in the pair of legal tomes _ called
``proposed findings of fact'' _ is not new. But this stage of the
trial process permits each side to lay out its interpretation of
the evidence unfettered by the cross-examination and conflicting
evidence submitted in the courtroom.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is the chance for each side to present its favorite
narrative of events,'' noted William Kovacic, a professor at the
George Washington University law school.
</P>
<P>
   Each side will submit revised findings of fact in September, to
take into account what the other camp asserted Tuesday. For Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson, the fact-finding documents provide a kind
of sourcebook and balancing tool, legal experts say.
</P>
<P>
   For each allegation, the judge weighs the arguments side by
side. In a civil action, the legal standard that must be met by the
plaintiff _ the government, in this case _ is known as
``preponderance of the evidence.'' In simple language, the court
must answer the question, ``Is it more likely than not that the
government's allegation is true?''
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of ``balancing decisions'' are the ones Jackson must
make repeatedly in this complex case _ and it is why, legal experts
say, the proposed findings of fact can be so crucial to the outcome
of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``These documents are road maps for the judge,'' said Andrew
Gavil, a professor at the Howard University law school. ``If they
work well, they point the judge in a direction that each side wants
him to face in looking at the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft clearly wants Jackson to look at and consider the
multibillion-dollar purchase of Netscape Communications Corp. by
America Online Inc., which was announced last November, after the
trial began.
</P>
<P>
   From the first page of its filing, Microsoft points to the
AOL-Netscape deal, which includes a side alliance with Sun
Microsystems Inc., as proof of what Microsoft argued at the trial:
that the company lives in a fast-changing industry, that its
seemingly powerful market position is constantly under threat and
that the suit itself was the result of its competitors' winning
over the Justice Department to their side.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Netscape's link to America Online, the online service
that accounts for 40 percent of all Internet access in the United
States, Microsoft contends that ``AOL is now in a position of
control with regard to usage of Web browsing software.''
</P>
<P>
   To make the point that Netscape now has a powerful corporate
parent, Microsoft points to previously sealed testimony saying that
the America Online board was told that the company would be willing
to spend $10 a copy to promote Netscape's browser.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft tries to cast doubt on the candor of two government
witnesses _ a Netscape executive, and one from America Online _ by
noting that depositions and documents show that the AOL-Netscape
talks were under way before the trial began.
</P>
<P>
   The government responds that on the contrary, the acquisition of
Netscape proves its point. By using its market power to prod
computer makers and Internet access suppliers into exclusionary
deals, the government asserts, Microsoft succeeded in sufficiently
limiting Netscape's distribution and blunting its challenge to
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Netscape was acquired because it had been damaged by
Microsoft's campaign,'' the government stated. And it cited
deposition testimony from AOL chairman Stephen Case, saying that
``we bought Netscape, to some extent, despite the browser
business,'' explaining that the main attractions were Netscape's
popular Web site, server and electronic commerce software.
</P>
<P>
   The government is trying to focus Jackson's attention in
particular on its claims of consumer harm _ even though most
consumers do not see much evidence of it as PC prices continue to
decline.
</P>
<P>
   The government has tried to refine and strengthen its consumer
argument. First, it says that operating system software prices
would be lower if Microsoft were not a monopoly and that consumers
would have more choice. The government cites deposition testimony
from PC makers saying they would prefer to have more choice.
</P>
<P>
   The government then raises the specter of future harm, a
distortion of the path of innovation, unless Microsoft is reined
in. The company is intent on extending ``its monopoly powers into
servers, Internet protocols, and other industry segments.
Microsoft's efforts to pre-empt threats to this control will, in
part, inhibit the emergence of other potential paradigm shifts'' _
a rerun, the government warns, of how Microsoft dispatched the
first wave of the Internet challenge.
</P>
<P>
   That, according to Microsoft, is a totally distorted view of the
company and industry environment it inhabits. ``In short,''
Microsoft said, ``the world is changing very rapidly, and the
changes that are taking place are inconsistent with the notion that
Microsoft possesses durable monopoly power.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime this fall, Jackson, after poring over the arguments
from both sides, will issue his own findings of fact. These will be
first definitive signal of Jackson's position. His findings will be
the basis for his conclusions of law _ and his findings, legal
experts predict, could also serve as a new prod to reach a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a settlement, closing arguments are scheduled
to be heard in September, and a ruling is likely around the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have posted their filings on Web sites. The
government document can be found at www.usdoj.gov/atr. The
Microsoft document is at www.microsoft.com/presspass/trial.

   The rap on electronic-commerce is that profits are rare. But at
least one group of companies has already begun to earn big money
on-line: the consultants who help others set up shop on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   More evidence came Tuesday when I-Cube of Cambridge, Mass.
agreed to be sold to Razorfish Inc. of New York, for stock worth
about $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big price tag for I-Cube, a seven-year-old company known
to few even under under its previous name, International
Integration Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But I-Cube has earned more than $13 million since 1996, profits
Razorfish chief executive Jeff Dachis attributes to an
old-fashioned business model both his company and I-Cube have
pursued: selling consulting services for more than it costs to pay
a staff to provide them.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many pure Internet companies with unproven profit
sources, ``We're able to quantify this into basic mechanics,''
Dachis said.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two companies earned about $1.1 million during the
second quarter, or $3.3 million excluding certain charges, on
combined revenue of $33.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   That's in contrast to Amazon.com, one of the best-known
electronic-commerce companies, which reported a loss of $138
million for the same period on revenue of $314 million.
</P>
<P>
   Such losses may be unavoidable as big retailers build out their
brand names in cyberspace. But much of their spending is reflected
on the bottom lines of local players like I-Cube or its Cambridge
neighbor Sapient Corp., or the big Wellesley, Mass. office of
Anderson Consulting LLP.
</P>
<P>
   All are benefiting from the rush to offer electronic-commerce
services, said Judith Hurwitz, a consultant who serves the same
market. ``All businesses are facing electronic competition and they
have to play in this environment to compete,'' Hurwitz said. ``But
you have to clean up your house before you invite the neighbors in.
You have to make sure your model works and you're not going to do
an eBay.''
</P>
<P>
   The reference is to the San Jose, Calif-based Internet auction
service, which was forced off-line for nearly a full day in June by
a computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   Clients are anxious to avoid that outcome, but they also want to
move on-line quickly, said Meredith McCarty, senior analyst at
International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   She expects the market for Internet consulting and system
integration services to increase to $78.6 billion in 2003 from $7.8
billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of I-Cube, the company said it agreed to be acquired
by Razorfish in order to provide a fuller service line.
</P>
<P>
   I-Cube is best-known for its work connecting back-office
operations like databases with the Internet, for clients including
American Express and Shell International.
</P>
<P>
   Razorfish, meanwhile, develops what are termed ``front-end
solutions'' for the likes of Bank One and Charles Schwab, to allow
their clients to view their accounts on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   I-Cube employs about 400 people including about 200 at its
office in Cambridge, while Razorfish has about 600 workers.
</P>
<P>
   I-Cube chief executive Michael Pehl said the merger would not
lead to layoffs and suggested Razorfish will likely expand its
local presence instead.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for each of I-Cube's roughly 27.4 million
total shares to be exchanged for 0.875 shares of Razorfish.
</P>
<P>
   The New York firm's stock fell 3 1/4 in Nasdaq trading Tuesday
to close at 25, valuing each share of I-Cube at 21.88 apiece_a
slight premium over I-Cube's closing price of 19.875 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase is expected to be completed later this year pending
approvals from shareholders and regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Dachis will remain president and chief executive of the company.
I-Cube's Pehl will become chief operating officer of Razorfish,
effectively its second-in-command, and will join its board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   Other I-Cube executives will also become board members, Dachis
said, though he declined to say how many seats I-Cube would
receive. I-Cube chief financial officer, Larry Begley, will take a
similar post at Razorfish.
</P>
<P>
   The company's current CFO, Sue Black, will become executive
vice-president for mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The companies declined to discuss specific impacts on earnings
expectations. Dachis said there would be an unspecified charge
against earnings related to acquisition costs.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ For a brief moment in the 1950s, Dorothy Dandridge
was a movie star who rivaled Marilyn Monroe and Ava Gardner. But
Dandridge's film career sputtered and she fell victim to personal
demons, tragedy and, perhaps most of all, bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   The first black woman ever nominated for an Academy Award as
best actress died penniless _ but still beautiful _ at the age of
42 in 1965. It's still unclear whether Dandridge took her own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw `Carmen Jones' when I was 18,'' recalled Halle Berry,
the star and an executive producer of HBO's ``Introducing Dorothy
Dandridge,'' which has its premiere on Saturday at 9 p.m. ``I was
home in Cleveland and I was watching a UHF station one afternoon
and I was mesmerized. I remember thinking, Wow! I had never seen a
black woman quite like that in a film.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berry said she went to the local library to research the
actress-singer and has never since stopped trying to assess,
understand and, yes, identify with Dorothy Dandridge.
</P>
<P>
   One result of that is a project that had been rejected over the
years by almost every movie studio in town. ``The answer was no,
no, no, and the very reason that I wanted to make the movie was the
very reason they didn't want to make it _ and that's because nobody
knew who she was,'' said Ms. Berry, 33, who is, even by Hollywood
standards, extraordinarily beautiful but whose career in films like
``Jungle Fever,'' ``Losing Isaiah'' and ``Bulworth'' has not been
an especially easy one.
</P>
<P>
   HBO welcomed the project. ``Halle's passion for it, her
commitment, was extraordinary from the outset,'' said Jeff Bewkes,
chairman of HBO. ``For us, it was the story of a groundbreaking
performer who lived a very interesting life in the larger cultural
context of what it was like to be a black entertainer. She couldn't
swim in the hotel she was performing at in Las Vegas. She was
refused access to restrooms at the very hotels at which she was
drawing large crowds. It was shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   So are the facts of Ms. Dandridge's life that serve as the basis
of the film, which was directed by Martha Coolidge and adapted by
Shonda Rhimes and Scott Abbott from the 1970 book ``Dorothy
Dandridge,'' by Earl Mills. Mills, her longtime manager, was, like
many men, admittedly infatuated with her.
</P>
<P>
   As depicted in the film, Dandridge was reared as a performer by
her mother, Ruby, an actress who appeared on the ``Amos 'n' Andy''
television series.
</P>
<P>
   Although the child blossomed into a charismatic, sexy singer and
dancer, her life was horrific almost from the outset. As a young
girl, she was abused by her mother's violent lesbian lover. Her
later love affairs were unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   While performing at the Cotton Club, she met the suave tap
dancer Harold Nicholas. Their marriage was strained and produced a
severely retarded daughter, whose condition left Dandridge
guilt-ridden for the rest of her life. Dandridge felt that she _
and her husband _ were somehow responsible for the child's
retardation because when Dandridge was in labor they got to the
hospital late.
</P>
<P>
   At a Hollywood party, Dandridge was discovered by Mills. He
secured an audition for her in 1954 for ``Carmen Jones,'' an
all-black musical melodrama based on the Bizet opera. She won the
leading role and began a five-year love affair with the film's
director, Otto Preminger.
</P>
<P>
   But as extraordinary as she was in the film, the roles that
followed were often tepid, because studios had no idea how to deal
with a black female star as opposed to Gardner or Monroe, who were
her friends in Hollywood (Dandridge was the first person Monroe
called when Joe DiMaggio left her). Preminger, who felt his career
would be destroyed if he married a black woman, walked out on her.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the affair with Preminger shattered her. ``He
abandoned her at a time when it really had a profound effect on
her,'' said Ms. Berry. ``He wasn't strong enough to stand up and
confess his love for her because of the racism of the time, and
says in the movie that neither of them would work again if it came
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he never really acknowledged her, and that devastated her.
When people are telling you that you're beautiful and great, but
the man you love is saying, `You're not good enough for me,' what
does that do to your psyche?''
</P>
<P>
   The career and personal troubles Dandridge endured hardly
diminished her charisma: she was a blend of elegance, beauty and
sexuality in films like ``Porgy and Bess'' and ``Island in the
Sun,'' a drama about racial strife in the West Indies, and in her
nightclub appearances. (Time magazine said that at a club
performance she ``came wriggling out of the wings like a
caterpillar on a hot rock.'')
</P>
<P>
   She was the first black woman to appear on the cover of Life
magazine and the first to appear at the Academy Awards as a
presenter. She was said to have had affairs with several men,
including Peter Lawford.
</P>
<P>
   She also defiantly fought the bigotry she found in clubs in
Miami Beach and Las Vegas and struggled vainly for Hollywood roles
that went beyond, as Ms. Berry put it, ``girls in banana hats and
curled slippers.'' (By contrast, Lena Horne, another black star,
appeared in MGM musicals but only as, say, a nightclub performer
and not as an actress with relationships to white characters.) But
Dandridge fought a losing battle.
</P>
<P>
   Her final years were deeply troubled. She had a brief marriage
to an abusive nightclub owner and was forced to pay off his debts
in a divorce settlement that left her bankrupt. Distraught and
without money, she had to hand over her daughter to the state to be
institutionalized.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dandridge became addicted to prescription drugs. On the eve of
leaving on a national nightclub tour in an effort to revive her
career, she was found dead in her home. The Los Angeles coroner's
office classified the death as an overdose of a prescription
antidepressant, Tofranil, but declined to rule it a suicide or an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   The team that made the film are not of a single mind on the
cause of death. Ms. Berry said: ``It is a mystery, but I am
inclined to believe, especially after playing her and looking at
some things that have happened in my life, that was she so
discouraged that she killed herself. Even though she had packed her
bags, I think, somehow, she had reached the end. She was just
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Coolidge, the director, disagrees. ``She was on the
upswing; she was about to leave for New York,'' she said. ``We will
never know the truth, but had she lived I think she would have had
a career.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rhimes, the screenwriter, who believes Dandridge did commit
suicide because she was just too weary to start her life all over
again, said, however: ``Until the end of her life she was a person
who never gave up. She was also a lady in the classic sense of the
word. The way she dealt with racism on the road _ always smiling,
very sweet, very calm. She never raised her voice, but in the end
she was as tough as nails.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berry, seated on the patio of a quiet Italian restaurant
near Beverly Hills, admitted that her longtime yearning to play
Dandridge was not merely a desire to make a statement about the
hardships of being a black actress. It was also a first-rate role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not really been able to be a leading lady in a film,''
she said. ``And it gave me a chance to do that.'' She shrugged.
``It's hard enough being an actress, but being a black actress __
'' The words drifted off. ``Now I've played Dorothy Dandridge, so
there's no other role for me to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berry grew up in Cleveland and dropped out of college after
a year to pursue a modeling career. That led her to New York, where
she took acting lessons. Her first acting role _ in ``Living
Dolls,'' a short-lived ABC series about fashion models _ began a
career that has been successful but not quite satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Her next role will be in a splashy, big-budget 20th Century Fox
film, ``X-Men,'' based on the comic book. ``I play a character
who's black in the comic book,'' said Ms. Berry, ``so it's not a
stretch for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how she, unlike Dorothy Dandridge, can refrain from going
over the edge, partly because of the frequent rejection for roles
solely because she's black, Ms. Berry said simply: ``I can't go
crazy. I can't. It's not even an option.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I value my life too much,'' she continued. ``And when I read
stories in history about the people before me, people who got up
every day and some of them had shackles on their feet and they
fought the fight, how could I even consider not fighting the fight?
I have a charmed life. How could I be so tired that I would go mad?
I have an opportunity to incite change and carry the ball. It's
almost a responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the film about Dandridge, which has consumed her for the
last few years, has, Ms. Berry said, lessened the frustrations of
trying to succeed as a black actress. One day, she said, there will
be a black female movie star who will equal the success of, say,
Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that I may not break through but I have to carry
the ball that I have, just like Dorothy, in her way, never broke
through but she carried the ball, too, and she made it possible for
me to be here,'' said Ms. Berry quietly. ``So I have to do my part.
And if I don't see my breakthrough, if it doesn't happen in my
lifetime, somebody else down the road will break through. And
perhaps I'll be able to play a part in that too, just like Dorothy
played a part in my life.''

STRIDE RITE TO CUT ADMINISTRATIVE JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A month after its new chief executive abruptly resigned, Stride
Rite Corp. said Tuesday it will cut about 125 positions from its
administrative staff in a bid to save $9 million annually and to
give its footwear business a sharper focus.
</P>
<P>
   Because some of the positions eliminated were already unfilled,
only about 70 people will lose their jobs, Stride Rite said.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 of the people losing their jobs work at Stride Rite's
headquarters in Lexington, Mass., which had employed 450 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Staff reductions are always difficult,'' said Myles J.
Slosberg, Stride Rite's interim chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Stride Rite has operated as several nearly
autonomous divisions putting out such footwear lines as Keds,
Sperry Top-Siders, and its namesake children's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Streamlining'' its administrative and sales staff by a 13
percent work force reduction should help the company to better
integrate and centralize various operations, Stride Rite said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes will bring more focus on integrating strategic
initiatives,'' said Diane M. Sullivan, recently promoted to Stride
Rite president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are important steps toward building earnings leverage
for the company going forward,'' said analyst Steven A. Richter of
Tucker Anthony Cleary Gull, who added ``This is very positive for
the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Stride Rite said it expected to record a third-quarter pretax
charge of $3 million for severance and other costs related to the
initiatives announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several years, Stride Rite has looked to lessen its
dependency on Keds, a brand subject to the whims of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   To this end, Stride Rite has entered agreements to market
footwear under such brand names as Tommy Hilfiger and Nine West
Kids.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Stride Rite hired James A. Eskridge to be its
chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Eskridge told Wall Street his mission was to make brand
acquisitions for the company.
</P>
<P>
   But Eskridge and Stride Rite's board apparently clashed, and
Slosberg, a member of the family that founded the company 80 years
ago, was brought in as interim chairman and chief.
</P>
<P>
   Stride Rite declined to comment on the progress of its search
for Eskridge's permanent replacement, though it said its long-term
strategy still includes ``prudent business acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   After Eskridge quit, Stride Rite re-examined its business, and
Tuesday's announcement was a result of that re-examination, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite management turnover, Stride Rite's business fundamentals
remain sound, analyst Richter said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to job cuts, Stride Rite announced plans to
repurchase an additional 2 million shares of its stock as it looks
to increase shareholder value.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, company shares rose 1/16 Tuesday
to close at 8 7/16.

MARKET PLACE: REGULATORS PUT BROKERAGES ON NOTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Actions by state and national securities regulators
in recent weeks have brought increased and scrutiny to some
once-obscure corners of Wall Street. Although the cases are very
different, a common theme runs through them: Executives of
brokerage firms both large and small have to take more
responsibility for protecting the individual investor.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage firms that may have looked the other way as investors
were hurt either by fraudulent practices or by risky trading
strategies are being put on notice that such practices will no
longer be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the report on Monday from state securities
regulators on daytrading firms is a shot across the bow to
brokerage firms in the growing business of electronic stock
trading. Deceptive marketing practices, the downplaying of risks
associated with rapid-fire stock trading and other misconduct will
not be tolerated, the regulators made clear.
</P>
<P>
   And in a settlement last week with Bear Stearns Securities
Corp., which processes more investor trades than any other firm on
Wall Street, the Securities and Exchange Commission sent a message
to the nation's 185 clearing firms that they must be vigilant
against fraudulent practices at the smaller firms whose trades they
handle. This is a big change; clearing firms have escaped
responsibility for such activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our markets will remain strong only as long as people
recognize that their responsibilities extend beyond their narrow
self-interest,'' said Richard H. Walker, director of enforcement at
the SEC. ``And when their view becomes clouded, we will not
hesitate to remind them of their broader responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Central to the regulatory position is something known as
suitability, Wall Street terminology for the matching up of an
investor's needs or objectives with the appropriate investment to
help meet those needs. Internet stocks, for example, would not be
considered a suitable investment for an 80-year-old widow seeking
preservation of capital.
</P>
<P>
   A brokerage firm is required to make sure that an investment or
strategy is suitable to the client it is being recommended to. But
advances in technology have broken down some methods that brokerage
firms used in the past to ensure investments were suitable. Now,
anyone with access to a computer modem can trade stocks without
ever meeting a broker. Furthermore, investors executing those
trades electronically do not have the help of a responsible broker,
who might well ask an 80-year-old widow placing an order if buying
an Internet stock is such a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many online brokerage firms have argued that they
cannot possibly monitor the suitability of the investments their
clients are choosing in cyberspace. Furthermore, why should they
have to enforce suitability rules when their customers make their
own investment decisions?
</P>
<P>
   Suitability questions about daytrading are especially worrisome
to regulators. Although the marketing materials for day-trading
firms often say that the strategy is not appropriate for all
investors, many firms play down the risks.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators in Massachusetts, for example, filed an action
against All-Tech Investment Group, one of the nation's largest
daytrading firms, last December. A major part of the regulators'
case against the firm was that it essentially claimed in its
advertising that daytrading was suitable for just about anyone,
that the technique was easy and profitable. Without admitting or
denying the allegations, All-Tech agreed to stop doing business in
the state for two years and returned $228,000 to some of its
customers there.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms have even argued to regulators that they do not have
to meet the same suitability standards required of full-service
brokerage firms like Merrill Lynch and Paine Webber because as
daytrading firms they are not peddling stocks, but selling
computerized access to the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear to us that there is a large sector of the
daytrading community that has acted as though the suitability rule
does not apply to them,'' said Matthew Nestor, director of the
Massachusetts Securities Division. ``They hide behind the fact that
they are teaching a trading system. Too many daytrading firms have
created a legal fiction that these rules do not apply to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as improved technology brought daytrading into being, so
too did technology bring considerable growth to the nation's
securities clearing businesses. In recent years, these firms, which
process trades for small brokerage firms and administer their
customers' paperwork, were able to take on more and more smaller
firms as clients. Bear Stearns, the leader in the clearing
business, has 2,700 customer firms and says it clears trades in
over 70 countries, accounting for more than 10 percent of New York
Stock Exchange volume daily.
</P>
<P>
   By contracting with a larger firm that provides clearing
services and much-needed capital, thousands of small firms, also
known as correspondent firms, were able to set up shop. Some of
them committed huge frauds against the investing public, stealing
hundreds of millions of dollars through stock manipulation and
other securities law violations.
</P>
<P>
   Even as these frauds were being committed by the small firms,
some big firms in the clearing business argued that they bore no
responsibility for the activities of the correspondent firms'
employees. They were, after all, once removed from the practices
and only served as administrators or bankers to the firms. How
could they police hundreds of firms trading thousands of shares
each day? It was a dream combination: an exceedingly lucrative
business with virtually no strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, in the wake of the SEC's settlement with Bear
Stearns, clearing firms can no longer turn a blind eye to
fraudulent or other problem practices taking place at the firms
whose trades they process.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say that most clearing firms already police their
correspondent firms' operations closely and well, so increased
scrutiny from the SEC is unlikely to have much of an impact on
them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   James M. Walsh, managing director of S.G. Cowen Securities
Corp., said that his firm already scrutinizes his clearing
customers carefully. Nevertheless, the SEC case will tie the
correspondent firm much more closely to the clearing firm. ``A
clearing firm must get into the mind of the correspondent firm,''
he said, ``not just to keep people from breaking the law, but in
large part to keep people from unknowingly doing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis D. Lowenfels, a lawyer at Tolins &AMP; Lowenfels in New York,
and Alan R. Bromberg, professor of law at Southern Methodist
University in Dallas, have written an article entitled
``Suitability in Securities Transactions'' to be published in the
August issue of The Business Lawyer, a publication of the American
Bar Association. A theme of the article is that in recent years,
advancements in technology have outpaced certain areas of
securities regulation. Now, that may be changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The convergence of new technology, a hot stock market,
daytrading and microcap fraud have stimulated regulators to
re-examine the whole suitability doctrine,'' Lowenfels said, ``and
refashion it to meet the needs of today's marketplace.''

   Don't ask Ella Baff, the newish executive director of the
Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, to speak about ballet, modern dance
and ethnic dance. These are labels, in her opinion, that do not
evoke dance's ``variety and texture'' (two of her favorite words).
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the first season she has programmed at the famed
festival in the Berkshires, offers a hint of what she has in mind
for its future: namely, an ever-expanding view of dance that is
also increasingly international.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolshoi ballerina Nina Ananiashvili and her touring group
from Moscow, which open on Aug. 25, may have little in common with
the performers on today's programs: Hugo and Ines, experimental
mimes and puppeteers, and the Afro-Cuban group of dancers and
musicians Los Munequitos de Matanzas.
</P>
<P>
   Nor &UR;  &LR; is there any evident connection between Paul Taylor, whose
choreography was seen earlier this summer at the Pillow, and Batoto
Yetu, the acclaimed children's African-dance troupe from Harlem
that opens on Wednesday with young Portuguese guest artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each thing is very different from another at this festival:
that's the idea,'' Ms. Baff said recently in a telephone interview.
``If you try to offer a new and broad international palette, then
you have an expanding repertoire in dance that the audience might
find interesting. I'm looking for the best of what there is in the
whole world, from the Bronx to Burundi.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Pillow's eighth director since the death of its founder,
Ted Shawn, in 1972, Ms. Baff, 45, is less concerned with living in
the past than in dealing with a changing arts scene. Shawn
established the festival, in Becket, Mass., in 1933 as a home for
his company, Men Dancers.
</P>
<P>
   He later presented a relatively wide range of performers in
different idioms. But he had strong opinions about those who
followed him as a modern-dance pioneer; he was not interested in an
avant-garde reputation for the Pillow and its summer dance school.
</P>
<P>
   A major change came under Liz Thompson's leadership, from 1980
to 1990. Ms. Thompson built a second theater and expanded the
grounds and buildings. She also introduced performances and
residencies with cutting-edge choreographers, a policy continued by
her successors, Samuel A. Miller, Sali Ann Kriegsman and Ms. Baff,
who was appointed in 1997, oversaw the 1998 season planned by Ms.
Kriegsman. The Pillow, also under Ms. Kriegsman, retired a $4.8
million cumulative deficit in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Working today with an annual budget of $3.6 million, Ms. Baff
admitted to some ``Europe envy'' in that European festivals, thanks
to state subsidies, have greater choices in programming. But
box-office pressures should not come first at the Pillow, she
declared as she returned to her main theme of presenting ``dance in
all its definitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Warming to her subject, she went on, ``I like to travel, and
most people, when they travel, open up.'' Presenters, as some arts
producers call themselves, should have ``a healthy relationship
with the audience that encourages the kind of curiosity you have
when you travel,'' Ms. Baff said. ``You might feel vulnerable in a
strange town with no reference point. But the more you explore, the
more things look alive to you. It's a great state to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugo and Ines, for instance, use knees and other parts of their
bodies to create different characters and thus ``broaden an
audience's sense of movement,'' Ms. Baff said. Similarly, she would
like audiences to be aware of a variety of styles in African dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a specific repertoire,'' she added. ``I would like to
expose people to a wide range of dance. Much of it has been
presented in a limited way.''
</P>
<P>
   Music suggests how definitions can be extended. ``When I was a
child, the repertoire available to us is not what it is now. Think
of the early-music recordings alone. I'm concerned with what is
brokered to us, culturally. Dance is a little behind.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This may surprise audiences that are familiar not only with the
boundary-shifting esthetics of American experimental choreographers
but also with forms that range from Baroque dance to clearly
distinct styles from India.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one suspects Ms. Baff's enthusiasm lies in her belief that
there is always something over the horizon to be explored. The
audience, she also believes, can be enriched on this journey
through the kind of multiple activities that are part of the total
Pillow experience: pre- and post-performance talks (often with the
choreographers involved), opportunities to view films and videos,
and free performances and events on an outdoor stage in the
festival's ``Inside/Out'' series. At one event, Taylor read from a
novel he is writing.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what were the benefits of all this information
channeled, if not stuffed, down a spectator's eager throat, Ms.
Baff replied, &UR;  &LR; ``Knowledge and interaction &UR; . &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe in patronizing audiences,'' she continued.
``There are hazards, as we've learned from hyper-academe. You can
intellectualize out the authentic experience. But I want people to
be engaged in an art form. It stimulates discussion when people
talk to each other about art. We should never get so jaded that we
lose that impulse to share.''
</P>
<P>
   As in past years, the Pillow has acted as a service organization
to the public and artists alike. Ms. Baff, who lives in nearby Otis
with her husband, John Badanes, a clinical pharmacist, is involved
in the festival's year-round activities, which include programs in
local schools and at Mass MOCA (the Massachusetts Museum for
Contemporary Art) in North Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Support to selected choreographers at various stages of their
careers is a prime goal. This summer, residencies (studio space,
housing, meals) have been provided to the New York-based
choreographers Wally Cardona and Ben Munisteri as well as Kota
Yamazaki from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The festival school occasionally integrates its sessions into
the performance series. Students in a three-week workshop were
taught choreography from different stagings of ``The Rite of
Spring.'' Taylor's version was performed by his company and Ms.
Baff invited the pianist Peter Serkin to coach the two fellowship
students from Tanglewood who played for Taylor. ``I want more live
music in the theater,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baff's own introduction to theater, music and dance came
early. Her older sister, Regina Baff, became an actress. As a child
in New York City, Ms. Baff studied piano, violin and harp. She
attended the Martha Graham school and continued in ballet and
modern dance with other teachers before graduating from the
University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   At Cal Performances, the arts presenting organization there, she
was director of education and community programs and then program
director. Among her other activities was teaching dance and theater
in juvenile prisons. ``It was a really remarkable experience that
is deep within me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The same faith in exposure to the arts can be sensed in her view
of the Pillow experience. ``You get to be in close proximity to
artists who are working here,'' she said. ``This is where dance
lives.''

 William Harris' most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about
the dancer-choreographer John Jasperse.  
 By WILLIAM HARRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every Thursday night since January, cognoscenti have
been flocking to a sassy dance-theater performance at the Pyramid
Club in Manhattan's East Village. ``The Donkey Show,'' conceived by
Randy Weiner and directed by Weiner and his wife, Diane Paulus, is
an adaptation of Shakespeare's ``Midsummer Night's Dream'' as
interpreted through the lyrics of disco music and the dances these
catchy tunes inspired, including the hustle, the bump and the
freak.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography was created by the company under the
supervision of Ms. Paulus, who danced with the New York City Ballet
as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Now this production is transferring to El Flamingo, a larger
club in Manhattan, with the help of Jordan Roth, 23, the son of the
veteran impresario Daryl Roth (currently represented by ``De la
Guarda'' and ``Wit'') and MAC Cosmetics, in its first theatrical
venture.
</P>
<P>
   The show is to open on Wednesday, with previews through the
previous week. Six days a week audiences can join the dancing, both
before and after the 55-minute performance, as well as sip
cocktails throughout. Tickets are $25.
</P>
<P>
   There is no dialogue in the show, but lots of cross-dressing,
lip-synching and polyester. In other words, something for everyone.
People who know the play will be struck by the way vintage disco
hits like ``Don't Leave Me This Way'' (sung by Thelma Houston,
1977), ``Enough Is Enough'' (Barbra Streisand and Donna Summer,
1979) or ``You Sexy Thing'' (Hot Chocolate, 1975) are used to
amplify the story of two couples unhappy in love and caught in the
cross hairs of the feuding Oberon and Titania, the king and queen
of the fairies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Shakespeare is all about passion and sex and drugs, just
like disco in the late 1970s,'' said Weiner, who has previously
re-examined ``Twelfth Night'' through the filter of pop music. ``I
love the metaphor in `Midsummer' of putting a drop of something in
someone's eyes and it instantly changes the world. It also dawned
on me that this is really a story about bestiality. I'm interested
in the tension between the hot music and the play's darker
images.'' Weiner, 34, and Ms. Paulus, 33, Manhattan natives, met in
a high school production of ``Wonderful Town'' 17 years ago. They
subsequently attended Harvard University, where they frequently
sneaked into the American Repertory Theater to see productions by
experimental directors like Robert Wilson, JoAnne Akalaitis and
Andrei Serban.
</P>
<P>
   However, both cite the comic actor-playwright-director Charles
Ludlam, founder of the Ridiculous Theatrical Company, as their
principal influence. In 1993, they founded the Project 400 Theater
Group, a populist New York troupe devoted to musical- and
community-based performance.
</P>
<P>
   Two more people have been added to the original 11-member cast
of ``The Donkey Show,'' and the design elements have been
sharpened.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the underground mentality of the event and the sense that
the show happens out of the organic life of a club is untouched,''
Ms. Paulus said. ``People came to us wanting to work on the show,
which is how this company was assembled. They are all highly
physical, but I would not call any of them dancers. I also think
anyone who wants to be a performer can be.''

 &HT;    Heritage students want return to routine
 &HT;    By Will Anderson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKDALE COUNTY, Ga. _ Heritage High School students return to
class today, nearly three months after a troubled teen opened fire
on his classmates, wounding six.
</P>
<P>
   But students, including some of those injured during the May 20
melee, said they are ready to get on with their education, and
don't want to focus on what happened months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally fine with it,'' said Brian Barnhardt, a junior who
was injured during the shooting. ``I went back the Monday after the
shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Barhardt, who testified in a court hearing Monday to determine
whether Anthony ``T.J.'' Solomon should be tried as an adult or a
juvenile for the shootings, said he remains angry at the
15-year-old Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't plan to forgive him,'' he said. ``He needs to go to
jail for the rest of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Barnhardt, Brian's father, said his son is apprehensive
about returning to the 1,400-student school, even though he may not
admit to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's nervous about going back. It's inevitable, but you have
to do it,'' Barnhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   School officials held an open house for new students Monday,
which was closed to news media. Media also will be kept off the
campus today, said Heritage High Principal Lowell T. Biddy. Biddy
said he wants the first day back to be a regular school day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the majority of the people feel good about being
here,'' Biddy said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents say they are ready for things to return to normal, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a good day if everybody would leave the kids
alone,'' said Mike Cheek, whose son, Jason, was one of the injured
students.
</P>
<P>
   Cheek, who sat through two days of testimony in juvenile court,
said the Heritage shooting was in part a copycat of the Colorado
school massacre on April 20. And he's tired of all the attention
that the shootings have gained.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the type of exposure these young people don't need,''
Cheek said. ``Unless everybody works together, we're going to keep
seeing this. And every time we do, we relive it.''

AVIGNON FESTIVAL RINGS WITH INTERNATIONAL FLAIR, STUMBLES WITH
LOCAL OFFERINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, Aug. 15)  
(yn) 
 By ANNE MIDGETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVIGNON, France _ Within the medieval walls of Avignon, the Rue
Republique cuts through the tangle of streets to the central Place
de l'Horloge and the broad white square in front of the Papal
Palace. Now, street and squares are a solid mass of people.
</P>
<P>
   Among the throngs are actors with outlandishly painted faces,
jugglers, men twisting balloons into animal shapes, mimes standing
motionless on soapboxes. A group of African drummers weaves
through, passing out fliers and singing.
</P>
<P>
   As a backdrop, every available surface is plastered with posters
advertising theater events, from Marguerite Duras plays to
circuses. The bright logos and graphics blend into a colorful
wallpaper or, hanging from lampposts in sheaths of plastic, flap
like the flags of unknown countries in the wailing gusts of the
mistral.
</P>
<P>
   ``For three weeks,'' says Alain Leonard, the director of the
Festival Off, Avignon's answer to the Edinburgh Fringe, ``the whole
city of Avignon becomes one big theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avignon Festival itself is the largest theater festival in
France. In its 53rd season this year, from July 9 to 31, it
presented more than 50 works of theater and dance in 23 spaces in
and around the city, from an old quarry eight miles out of town to
the traditional open-air stage of the Cour d'Honneur in the Papal
Palace.
</P>
<P>
   While French-language theater still accounts for more than half
of the program, this year's festival included a special focus on
South America, as well as works from Bulgaria, Italy and Germany.
Companies not invited to the main festival come at their own
expense to the Festival Off, and this year 550 did.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since it began in 1947 with Shakespeare's ``Richard II,''
Paul Claudel's ``L'Histoire de Tobie et Sara'' and a brand-new work
by a young author named Maurice Clavel, the Avignon Festival has
walked a fine line between old and new, provocative and popular
and, more recently, between focusing on France and moving into the
international arena.
</P>
<P>
   This year's season opener was ``Henry V,'' which had never been
performed in France perhaps because it shows the English triumphing
over the French. The critics were reserved; the public
enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum was ``Voyage au bout de la
nuit'' (``Voyage to the End of Night''), an adaptation of Celine's
novel by an Italian company, Societas Raffaello Sanzio. The
production focused on, among other things, the cadaver of a dead
horse, prompting both catcalls and bravos on its opening night.
``Avignon has had its scandal,'' Le Monde and other papers reported
with satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two audiences,'' said Bernard Faivre d'Arcier, who
has directed the festival since 1992 and led it from 1980 to 1984
as well. ``There is a more popular audience, which isn't much of a
connoisseur, which likes theater but is a little scared of the
critics and the Parisians. Then there is an audience composed of
real connoisseurs. So one has to bring these two together, combine
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the start of the festival,'' he continued, ``the audience
is more regional, so you have a production like `Henry V.' After
July 14, Bastille Day, when everyone goes on vacation'' _ heads
south, that is, from Paris to Avignon _ ``we do more divisive, more
provocative things: Angelin Preljocaj'' _ the contemporary ballet
choreographer _ ``or Raffaello Sanzio with Celine. And at the end
of the festival, we do a piece that brings everyone together.'' The
final work of the season was ``Tango, vals y tango'' by an
Argentinian choreographer, Ana Maria Stekelman.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, theater at the Avignon Festival was secondary.
The main event in 1947 was an exhibit of contemporary art in the
Papal Palace, and there was heated debate about placing work by the
likes of Bonnard and Picasso within those venerable walls. As an
added attraction, the popular actor and director Jean Vilar was
invited to stage one of his signature pieces, ``Murder in the
Cathedral.'' He proposed Shakespeare, Claudel and Clavel instead. A
welcome move toward decentralization _ transporting culture to
areas outside Paris _ the event was a success. ``Thanks to Jean
Vilar, Avignon may be able to give us a festival of theater the way
we have festivals of film,'' said the newspaper Le Figaro.
</P>
<P>
   In more than two decades as the festival's founder and director,
Vilar sought to bring new life to French theater and at the same
time create a dialogue with the distinctive architecture of the
medieval city. Today, however, festivals are less local than
international, and Avignon is no exception. The increasing number
of companies from abroad reflects a general trend, but it is also
an invitation for additional foreign spectators. While foreigners
accounted for only about 10 percent of the 115,000 tickets sold
this year, the exoticism of special programs devoted to Asia (last
year) or South America could attract wider audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The tango seems to be a trend these days, from California to
Switzerland. And in ``Pernambouc,'' Antonio Nobrega presented a
history of northern Brazilian popular music with the help of a
band, a clown and even a woman in a monkey suit, until the
audience's rhythmic clapping echoed off the cliff walls of the old
quarry, luminous in the moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   An even better synthesis of the popular and the highbrow was
``Auto da Paixao'' (``Mystery of the Passion''), also from Brazil
and performed in the gardens of the cathedral at midnight. Carrying
candles, the audience followed a group of dancing, folk-singing,
torch-bearing women up the dark paths, stopping at shrines by the
sculptor Romero de Andrade Lima, as if they were a new
interpretation of the Stations of the Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Every critic singled out for praise the director Thomas
Ostermeier, a rising star in Berlin, who brought three pieces,
including Mark Ravenhill's English morality tale, ``Shopping and .
. . ''
</P>
<P>
   Also strong was ``Maistora i Margarita,'' the Bulgarian Stefan
(Teddy) Moskov's adaptation of the classic Bulgakov novel. Moskov
used video clips, screens and well-timed slapstick to turn the
actors into cartoon-like figures who somersaulted through the air
or stood against a screen like sketches on a sheet of paper that
could be scribbled on or torn in two, as the author, seated at his
typewriter to one side of the stage, pondered what to do with them
next.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The festival makes a less convincing case for French theater.
Faivre d'Arcier has been faithful to a cadre of artists who return
to Avignon time and again: the young director and author Olivier
Py; the formidable and complex playwright Valere Novarina, or
Preljocaj. The latter's new work, ``Personne n'epouse pas les
meduses'' (``One Shouldn't Marry the Medusas''), was filled with
interesting ideas but lacked a compelling artistic flow, like an
elaborate new dish in a restaurant that boasts a wide range of
ingredients but no particular flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``To know a painter or an author well,'' said Faivre d'Arcier,
``it takes time, it takes years. You have to follow an author,
accompany him. In my opinion, Novarina is a great French author,
but it takes a number of years to explain his work and create a
loyal public.'' The impenetrability of Novarina's text in
``L'Operetta Imaginaire'' illustrated some of the differences
audiences could have with him, although the piece, with its
accordion accompaniment and send-ups of stock characters, was also
very funny.
</P>
<P>
   Py is a particular pet of Faivre d'Arcier's, but from Py's work
at this year's festival, it was hard to tell what the fuss was
about. ``Requiem for Srebrenica,'' true, was a thoughtful
presentation of a collage of journalistic pieces about the war in
Bosnia and eyewitness reports enacted by three woman on a floor of
echoing metal. But in the autobiographical ``Theatres'' that Py
wrote but did not direct, the protagonist (called simply Myself)
concluded with a long narration about the difficulties of his
generation and the artist's lot that was self-aggrandizing rather
than convincing.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Avignon Festival and the Centres Dramatiques, France's
national theaters like the one that Py now directs in Orleans, are
mainly financed by the French government. Py's success could
therefore be seen as relating to his approval from a certain circle
of state administrators as much as to widespread recognition of his
merits as an artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit as if university professors were to write novels
and books and then make sure everyone read only the novels and
books they wrote,'' said the author and actor Andre Benedetto about
the country's cultural administration in general. ``Like an army
corps, we also have a culture corps, a group of people out to
administer art _ `art' being what they say it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Benedetto, whose Theatre des Carmes is one of three in Avignon
that is active year round, was also one of the initiators of the
Festival Off, in which he participates every year. In the late
1960s, when theater troupes began coming unbidden to perform in
Avignon during the official festival, the Off (the term was adopted
to echo Off Broadway) was ``a challenge to the festival,
esthetically and politically,'' Leonard said. As the director of
the Festival Off, he created a more formal structure in 1982.
``Today,'' he said ``it is more a chance for companies to present
themselves than a political statement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Off doesn't turn anyone away, be it Korean actors,
Shakespeare in a Gypsy caravan, or Benedetto performing the
monologue ``San Jorgi Roc,'' a miner's moving soliloquy to his dead
brother about their shared heritage. It was rendered all the more
poignant through its unintelligibility to a good part of the
audience, since it is not in French but in Provencal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My principal goal,'' said Faivre d'Arcier, ``is that the
festival produce its own projects, more and more.'' He would like
to have more works like ``Le Cid'' of last year, by the Anglo-Irish
director Declan Donnellan, which the festival produced and then
toured around the world, with well-received performances at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music in April.
</P>
<P>
   Faivre d'Arcier is a reminder that festival administrators today
are increasingly like chefs: not artists themselves, but with more
and more pressure on them to bring together the right combinations
of ingredients _ pop singers and actors, film directors and operas
_ to create the requisite buzz of excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Avignon has all the ingredients for a successful
millennial season next year: Eastern Europeans, a production of
``Medea'' with Isabelle Huppert, and the ubiquitous equestrian
troupe Zingaro. Such combinations are generally guarantors of good
ticket sales. But this year's festival also demonstrated that,
however safe your bets, however generally good your shows, there is
no guarantee that the ingredients in your recipe will combine into
that rarity: true artistic excellence.

<P>
   Necessity may be the mother of invention, but surely boredom is
part of the equation, too. What else but idle hands would drive an
otherwise sensible person to transform an icon of modernist
restraint into a giddy evocation of pure hippie chic?
</P>
<P>
   ``Eszter Haraszty had no respect for this stuff,'' said Liz
O'Brien, a leading Manhattan dealer of 20th-century furniture. In
her move last week from her Soho gallery to an eponymous new space
at 800-A Fifth Ave., Ms. O'Brien brought along one of Haraszty's
homemade reinventions _ a bentwood Thonet settee, painted shining
white and dressed in white linen embroidered with voluptuous
Iceland poppies.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much stitchery over stitchery, in fact, that each
flower is about an inch thick. Though the effect is entirely unlike
that intended by its Victorian manufacturer, Michael Thonet, the
settee, which is priced at $5,250, has a happy-face joie de vivre
that Ms. O'Brien called ``a perfect statement of its time.''
</P>
<P>
   Make that the 1960s, not the 1860s, when the steam-bent wood
furniture manufactured by the company Gebruder Thonet came into
international vogue. With her blond Twiggy-style crop,
Gabor-sisters accent, thigh-high skirts and bug-eye sunglasses,
Eszter Haraszty was an Age of Aquarius heroine, one part Carnaby
Street to two parts Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   Though her name is unknown today, the Hungarian-born Haraszty,
who died in 1995 at 74, was an American design guru in the late
1940s and early 1950s, thanks to the ebullient color sense and
swashbuckling patterns she championed as the director of
KnollTextiles, the fabric division of the modern furniture
comeditedpany started in 1937 by Hans G. Knoll.
</P>
<P>
   Just as quickly as she made her mark there, however, Haraszty
resigned. First, she married a television producer, and then she
abandoned Manhattan for Los Angeles, where Haraszty set to work
revamping an unprepossessing house in Coldwater Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   The cottage was recast as a paean to flower power. Fireplaces
were encased in yellow-and-white flowered tiles, thickly flowered
rugs paved the floors, and giant red poppies, Haraszty's favorite
flower, were painted on the cobalt-blue garage door. Out in the
garden, the designer and her husband built a petal-shape altar to
sunworshipping: six scarlet vinyl mattresses set atop individual
brick platforms, all radiating from a Chinese paper parasol painted
with giant red and pink blooms.
</P>
<P>
   The provocateur couturier Rudi Gernreich, he of the breastbaring
monokini, was enthralled by what he enthusiastically called her
``dreamflowernatureartenchantedgardenhouseworld.'' Equally stunned,
House Beautiful devoted 10 pages to the 56-year-old designer's
hippie haven in its May 1966 issue, celebrating what the article's
writer, Elizabeth Sverbeyeff, described as Haszarty's ``blithesome,
blossoming world.''
</P>
<P>
   The cover was a closeup color photograph of a bouquet of orange
and red poppies bursting from a white pitcher that Haraszty
handpainted to match.
</P>
<P>
   The Iceland poppy was the designer's talisman (she also painted
them on her toenails): simple in shape and brilliant in color, its
petals as delicate as silk gauze and as bright as Kool-Aid. They
were, she wrote in her book ``Needlepainting: A Garden of
Stitches'' (Liveright, 1974), ``the purest, the most brilliant and
translucent colors I've found in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she had dismissed embroidery as a peasant's craft when
she was a child in Budapest, Haraszty took up her needles and yarn
again in 1960. Her first project was daunting in scale but a
triumph, after six months of work: embroidering a 10-foot-square
piece of white Belgian linen to create a cushion cover for a Thonet
chaise longue.
</P>
<P>
   Her next project, a sleeveless tunic, was less successful.
Weighing in at eight pounds, it proved unwearable. Chastened,
Haraszty framed the tunic and returned to her furniture, and soon,
every piece in the house _ old, new, antique, modern _ was
transformed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chrome and beige wicker, no matter how magnificent the lines,
seemed rather out of place in what might kindly be described as a
country house in search of a facade,'' she wrote. And, after all,
she reasoned, since the Bauhaus brigade, not to mention the Knolls,
had intended their furniture to be functional, and Haraszty could
only function surrounded by eyepopping colors, then reupholstering
the classic designs was entirely appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of its ponyskin upholstery, a Corbusier chaise longue
was dressed in needlework depicting purple and blue pansies.
Poppies bloomed on Brno chairs designed by her friend and fellow
Hungarian Marcel Breuer. Fist-size primroses covered the seat of a
Provencal side chair, poppies the size of bowling balls decorated
Sheraton arm chairs, and petunias erupted on the headboard of her
kingsize bed. And the settee exploded with poppies: orange, pink
and red, each petal executed in satin stitches and each stamens in
pert French knots.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Thonet settee is a turn-of-the-century original or a
reproduction purchased in the 1960s is unknown. In any case,
Haszarty did not care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faithful Thonet reproductions are on sale everywhere at very
reasonable prices,'' the designer wrote, echoing the practical
beliefs of the early modernist movement. ``In short, if you like
the atmosphere of our living room and find it out of the ordinary,
the look is one which all can afford.''

BC FEMINIST FIGHTS REMOVAL FROM OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES BANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- With TV cameras whirring, Mary Daly, the radical
feminist, philosopher and theologian, jiggled a key in the door at
Carney Hall and the lock didn't turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get in,'' exclaimed Daly, turning the key to room 467,
where she's spent at least 10 of her 33 years as a Boston College
professor. ``Do you see? It just doesn't work. But it did work last
night.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the perfect, albeit ironic, photo opportunity for Daly,
who is a celebrated fight with the college over its demand that she
resign from her tenured teaching job for refusing to allow men to
attend her classes. The 70 year-old Daly called a press conference
Tuesday to protest the university administration's request that she
remove all personal property from her office by Tuesday, a demand
she described as BC's latest assault in a campaign to ``silence and
erase,'' her.
</P>
<P>
   Daly is suing BC for breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really anticipated that it would get this violent, so
crude, so low-down,'' Daly told the assembled throng of journalists
and supporters. ``But here we are.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daly's effort to portray herself as a martyr to the cause of
feminism was blunted by the rambling nature of her statements,
inconvenient questions from reporters, and by a mysterious turn of
events surrounding the purported change of locks on her office
door.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the legal dispute is the question of whether
Daly is legally retired: Boston College says she is; Daly says
she's not. So far a judge in the case has appeared to side with the
college.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling last month, Middlesex Superior Court Judge Martha
Sosman said the school ``had adequate cause to terminate Daly''
irrespective of the final outcome of the case concerning her
refusal to allow men into her classes.
</P>
<P>
   During the press conference, Daly said Sosman would have her
conscience to reckon with but in an interview, Daly was less
tactful, describing Sosman as a disappointment to the gender, and
``an Aunt Tom.'' She continued to press her claim that she is the
victim of a right-wing conspiracy to undermine federal law against
discrimination by gender. The legal action against her started last
fall when senior Duane Napquin, who was kept out of Daly's
classroom, received legal backing from a conservative group, The
Center for Individual Rights, in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very clear that I'm a target,'' Daly said Tuesday. ``CIR
has Boston College as a willing collaborator and no doubt the
Vatican.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly's lawyer, Gretchen Van Ness, arrived late for the press
conference. A day before, Van Ness had lost a court case
representing a woman who had been denied access to a rally held by
Louis Farrakhan. In response to a reporter's question Van Ness said
there was nothing inconsistent about her role in the two cases,
saying the Daly case involved a private university while the
Farrakhan case involved a public meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Daly's supporters attended the conference bringing
``Mary Daly Defense Fund'' brochures and, in the case of one
supporter, a ``witch's broom,'' to sweep the office.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the attention Tuesday was focused on the mystery of
Daly's locked door. In the beginning of the press conference, one
of Daly's students said she had opened the office door the previous
day to discover a disquieting scene. All of the pictures had been
taken from the walls, she said, and all Daly's possessions had been
stacked in the center of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of an ominous, very unwelcoming look that the room
had,'' said Meg Niziol, who graduated this year.
</P>
<P>
   Daly accused the administration of ``breaking and entering.''
But the administration offered a less sinister explanation. BC
spokesman Jack Dunn said the college had merely painted the walls
to prepare the office for its new occupant and he denied Daly's
claim that the school had changed the lock on the door, suggesting
that Daly had intentionally used the wrong key to try and enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The locks weren't changed, which is what makes this whole
thing so annoying,'' Dunn said. ``Suddenly the lock issue is
overshadowing the main issue, which is Mary Daly's desire to
discrminate against her male students.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon learning that Daly could not get into the room, Dunn
summoned a Boston College janitor and by the end of the news
conference someone had opened the door. Journalists walked upstairs
where they crowded into the cramped office. Copies of Daly's books,
``Pure Lust,'' and ``Outercourse,'' lay in messy piles beside the
window. The walls appeared to have been recently painted and
spackled. Disappointed, journalists went home and Daly slipped into
a black limousine and headed to her next interview.

STARR SAYS HE HAD NO VENDETTA AGAINST CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In one of his most candid discussions about his
lengthy inquiry, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr on Tuesday
insisted that he was never motivated by a personal or political
vendetta against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense that this was a match between two
individuals; it wasn't,'' Starr said in an interview broadcast
Tuesday on NBC's ``Today'' program. ``It should not have been
viewed that way. It should not have been portrayed that way. It was
a professional process, and it was done professionally.''
</P>
<P>
   That process, of course, led to the impeachment of Clinton, but
Starr said there were no winners in the deeply bitter and divisive
battle that his prosecutors waged with the White House. Instead, he
called it ``a very sad chapter in our recent history'' that had
``cost the country terribly.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time, Starr was highly critical of Monica
Lewinsky, saying she was oblivious to the profound consequences of
her affair with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very immature,'' Starr said, ``and I think failed to,
in any way, appreciate the gravity of what she was doing,
including, frankly, assisting in the process of putting our leader,
who has to accept his own responsibility, in the most unfortunate
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr refused to characterize his view of Attorney General Janet
Reno. After lavishing praise on the ``honorable, decent people''
who work as career prosecutors at the Justice Department, Starr
declined to say anything about his opinion of Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you won't say the same thing about the attorney general?''
Lisa Myers, a correspondent for NBC News, asked Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to comment,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   `You leave the impression that you do not believe that she's
been honorable and decent throughout this,'' Ms. Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm simply not going to comment,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr may have simply believed it was inappropriate to discuss
Reno because the Justice Department has told Starr's office that it
plans to investigate the ethics of his office's Lewinsky
investigation, including prosecutors' questioning of Ms. Lewinsky
at the outset of the inquiry. The Justice Department is also
examining whether Starr failed to disclose possible conflicts of
interest in January 1998 when he asked Reno to expand his
jurisdiction to investigate the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Starr refused to comment about whether he would seek indictments
of anyone before he concludes his inquiry, which he estimated would
be concluded, with the filing of a final report, before the
November 2000 elections. That report, Starr said, would not
criticize anyone, including Hillary Rodham Clinton. ``There will be
no trashing of anyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could rule out any future indictments, Starr said,
``I think what I need to do is assiduously say, I can't comment.
And there should be no inference one way or the other drawn from my
inability to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr also spoke candidly about his own personal and
professional regrets, saying that his office ``made a number of
miscalculations with respect to public appearances.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think in the process of remaining silent, we allowed a
sense to develop that there were other motivations at work,'' Starr
said. ``And I think that's most _ most unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   And he added that the inquiry had taken a deep personal toll.
``Many times I thought, good grief, this whole mechanism of the
independent counsel statute is fraught with potential for mischief,
all kinds of defects,'' said Starr, who added that he hopes to
return for private law practice and continue to teach a law school
class.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Starr testified before a Senate committee that the
independent counsel law should not be renewed. It expired June 30,
just one day after Starr's office announced a plea agreement with
its last remaining defendant, Webster Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was asked if he believed there were ``any winners'' in his
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't,'' he said. ``But I do know this _ it cost the
country terribly. It caused my colleagues, my friends, a lot of
distress. And it's just a very sad chapter in our recent history.''

AFTER `TRAINSPOTTING,' A TRUER, DARKER COMIC VISION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 David Bahr is an arts and culture writer based in New York.  
 By DAVID BAHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its savvy soundtrack, cypnotic direction and a charismatic
cast of heroin-hooked hooligans, the 1996 film ``Trainspotting''
made substance abuse look like exhilarating fun. Based on the
Scottish writer Irvine Welsh's novel of sex, drugs and rock `n'
roll, the film was a seductive tour through life's skids.
</P>
<P>
   From its rapid-fire opening scene following a pack of fleeing
thieves (accompanied by Iggy Pop's ``Lust for Life'') to its
lulling evocation of an overdose (to the tune of Lou Reed's
``Perfect Day''), ``Trainspotting'' transformed Welsh's bleakly
comic narrative into a toe-tapping head trip worthy of MTV. Yet it
was precisely that slick sensibility that Welsh intended to avoid
when asked to write the screenplay for ``The Acid House,'' his
second work to be brought to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think commercially,'' said Welsh. ``I wanted to
do a movie that was a bit more hard-core. I wanted to make less of
a stylized pop video and more of a rock `n' roll art film where
everyone was a bit dotty, badly dressed and on the out.''
</P>
<P>
   What he wanted to make was a film more faithful to his fiction,
where being ``on the out'' is a way of life and black humor remains
the only respite. ``The Acid House,'' which opened on Aug. 6, is a
triptych of three short films _ and certainly truer to Welsh's work
in terms of tone and setting than Danny Boyle's ``Trainspotting,''
written by John Hodge.
</P>
<P>
   The language is coarser, with salty Scottish slang and
accompanying subtitles. The humor is darker, and, certainly in the
first two shorts, there's a fuller, albeit gloomier, sense of
working-class Edinburgh. And while the soundtrack boasts a rich
roster of contemporary British rock acts (Oasis, Beth Orton and
Belle &AMP; Sebastian all contribute tracks), the music doesn't drive
the narratives as much as it enhances them.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three shorts, the first, ``The Granton Star Cause,''
about a hapless young man who loses his home, girlfriend and job
before being transformed into a fly by God, and the third, ``The
Acid House,'' a hallucinatory tale of a man who switches identities
with an infant, are closer to the movie ``Trainspotting'' in their
use of Kafkaesque visuals. (That movie's more fantastical elements
included a character who dives through a dirty toilet into an
underwater netherworld and a head-spinning, wall-climbing baby.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``The Acid House'' centerpiece, ``A Soft Touch,'' about a
gullible galoot and his sadistic wife, is cinematic realism in the
vein of Mike Leigh or Ken Loach. Stark and moody, its
character-driven script and strong ensemble performances offset the
other two shorts' fantastical elements.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the three films provide a vivid showcase of the
40-year-old Welsh's imaginative breadth, even if they don't
necessarily cohere within a thematic framework.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Usborne, a co-producer of the film along with David Muir,
said he chose the three stories for their distinct strengths, not
because of any related subject matter. Having been ``blown away''
after reading Welsh in 1994, Usborne said, he tried to obtain the
film rights to ``Trainspotting,'' but Boyle beat him to it by a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Usborne then quickly optioned ``The Acid House,'' a collection
of short stories. ``I wanted to make a film 100 percent pure to
Irvine's vision,'' he said. ``With every rude word and a strong
sense of place.''
</P>
<P>
   A producer of documentaries before coming to Welsh's fiction,
Usborne chose the documentarian and Glasgow native Paul McGuigan to
direct ``The Acid House,'' even though McGuigan had never worked on
a drama before. ``I wanted the director to be Scottish and have a
good feeling for the place,'' Usborne said. ``Paul did some strong
documentary films, and I think that making documentaries is as good
a training as you can get. You get a lot of information and have to
hew it out, make it really sharp. You develop a smell for the
real.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At first McGuigan was signed to direct only ``The Granton Star
Cause.'' The goal was to make that film and use it to raise money
for rest of the project. A year after its completion, and some
positive film festival feedback, Usborne got Britain's Channel 4 to
finance ``A Soft Touch'' and ``The Acid House,'' with McGuigan
returning as director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only expected to make the first one,'' said McGuigan, who
previously shot three installments of Channel 4's documentary
series ``Walk on the Wild Side,'' about youth on British society's
edge. ``So I made it as mad and wild as I could, with no fear of
letting anyone down.'' It was after he was asked to direct the next
two films that his apprehension grew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first and third films were easier to do,'' he said. ``But
`A Soft Touch' required me to represent working class life in a
very true way. It actually suited my style, which comes from doing
documentaries, but my expectations were greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharing the same vision of authenticity with the screenwriter
and producer, McGuigan was given free rein. ``They just let me
go,'' he said. ``Irvine was fantastic. I'd say, `Can we change
something?' And he'd be `yeah, yeah no bother.'''
</P>
<P>
   Welsh said: ``I'm pretty easygoing. Some people think a little
too easygoing. But I can let someone else do the film because I see
it as their project. My thing is the books. And I get my stories
from where I live and the people I grew up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the three films, both Welsh and McGuigan prefer ``A Soft
Touch,'' viewing it as a maturer, more layered work that best
reflects the hard-knock life they knew while growing up in
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The story stars an affecting Kevin McKidd as Johnny, a
child-like lug who marries Catriona (the captivatingly baleful
Michelle Gomez), a cruel part-time prostitute with an even more
pugnacious bunch of brothers. Soon after the couple's shotgun
wedding (where half the male guests are suspected of impregnating
the bride), Catriona starts sleeping with a neighbor, Larry (an
elastic-faced Gary McCormack), a crazed bleach blond with a
penchant for practicing martial arts naked in front of the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Johnny is really a bit of a masochist,'' said Welsh.
``He gets off on the powerlessness of the situation. At the same
time, he wants to be one of the boys. There's a definite macho
culture in Scotland. There are a lot of Larrys.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath its pitch-black humor, Welsh sees his work as a
testament of human tenacity. ``People get beat up and knocked down
and they just go on,'' he said. ``There is a real will to
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Released in Britain in January, ``The Acid House'' may have
proved too darkly comic to rouse ``Trainspotting'' fans. According
to Usborne, its accumulated gross in Britain was only $500,000 as
compared to the $5 million earned by ``Trainspotting.''
</P>
<P>
   Welsh cites the weather. ``It opened the day after New Year's,''
he said. ``It was cold and damp and everyone was hung over. I found
the movie really depressing. I remember seeing it at a summer
festival and the audience really went wild over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Usborne concurred. ``Irvine believes his work plays best when
people have a little sunshine in their bones,'' he said. ``I'm
inclined to believe him.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Kept under lock and key in the Israeli state
archives for nearly 40 years, the last memoirs of the Nazi war
criminal Adolf Eichmann will be released to German researchers for
scholarly publication, the Israeli Justice Ministry announced on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to release the 1,200 pages of notes Eichmann wrote
in jail was fraught with concern that publication of his narrative
might obscure his role in Nazi crimes while granting posthumous
credibility to his version of events.
</P>
<P>
   Eichmann was the operations chief of the Nazi campaign to
exterminate European Jews during World War II. He was tried and
hanged in Israel in 1962 after having been seized two years earlier
in Argentina by Israeli agents.
</P>
<P>
   His prison notes, repeating courtroom arguments that he followed
orders and was just a cog in the Nazi machine, were locked away,
apparently out of concern that their publication might serve to
cast doubts on the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The chief prosecutor in the Eichmann trial, Gideon Hausner,
argued to Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion at the time that Eichmann
wanted to publish his memoirs in order to undermine the judgment of
the court.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli state archivist, Evyatar Friesel, said that although
he had examined the document with experts over the years, the
manuscript had not been made available to researchers because its
ownership remained in question.
</P>
<P>
   Eichmann's son, Dieter Eichmann, formally demanded this week
that Israel hand over the notes, arguing that they are his rightful
inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Ministry said in a statement that ``the entire
matter is being examined from a legal standpoint that also takes
into consideration the public perspective, historical ramifications
and uniqueness of the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The intention is to allow public scrutiny of this material as
soon as possible through its publication by German researchers
together with appropriate footnotes and accompanying material,''
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was reached at a meeting led by Attorney General
Elyakim Rubinstein and attended by government attorneys, Holocaust
experts and Friesel.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Yehuda Bauer, a prominent Holocaust scholar who
participated in the meeting, had advised against the immediate and
unfettered publication of the memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``All kinds of clowns will go over the manuscript and take
tidbits out of context, and yellow journalists will use it to write
yellow journalism which has nothing to do with Holocaust
research,'' he said. ``This is a matter of life and death of masses
of people. The truth has to be respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Bach, who was the deputy prosecutor in the trial, said
he was concerned that publishing the memoirs could be used to
question the verdict. ``Someone could come and say that this sheds
a different light on the subject, and we'll have to explain again
what we successfully refuted during the trial,'' he said. ``If
scholars publish it with the proper explanations, perhaps less
damage will be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Amos Hausner, a lawyer who is the son of the chief prosecutor in
the trial, said that publication of the manuscript would pose ``a
danger of real historical distortion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The verdict has been long forgotten, and the distorted version
will stand alone,'' Hausner said, arguing that the manuscript
should be published along with the verdict and a lengthy and
unpublished interview given by Eichmann to a pro-Nazi Dutch
journalist in the late 1950s, in which he presents more militant
views.
</P>
<P>
   However Tom Segev, a historian and author who has written about
the Holocaust, argued that the reluctance to allow immediate and
free public access to the memoirs betrayed fears whose time had
passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're scared to death that this document will be a
counterweight to the verdict which is still seen as the central
charter that explains why Israel has a right to exist,'' Segev
said. ``This sets us back 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel, which has pressed other nations to open up their
archives to Holocaust research, cannot restrict free access to
documents it holds, Segev said. He added that the release for
scholarly annotation showed exaggerated sensitivity to what should
properly be in the public domain.

TEVA BUYS COPLEY IN $220M DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Copley Pharmaceuticals Inc., still recovering from a
drug-manufacturing scandal in which it paid millions in fines and
settled several class-action lawsuits, Tuesday said it will be
acquired by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Israel's largest
drug maker, for $220 milion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The sale ends the Canton, Mass. generic drug maker's
relationship with Hoechst A.G., which paid $546 million for a 52
percent ownership stake nearly six years ago. The German
pharmaceutical giant has been trying to sell Copley for more than
two years and recently shed another American generic drug company
in an effort to exit from the generic drug business.
</P>
<P>
   Teva said it is paying $11 a share for Copley, or one-fifth of
the $55 per share paid in 1993 by Hoechst. Teva is also buying a
more stable company that recently strengthened its management team
and its product line, which includes 52 generic products ranging
from skin lotions to prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (Copley) is pretty much a bargain,'' said Peter Terreri,
chief financial officer of Teva's US operations in Sellersville,
Pa. ``As the industry has changed a lot, prices for generic drug
companies have come down and we are getting a company that is now
prepared for growth,''
</P>
<P>
   Copley shares closed Tuesday at 10 13/16, up 1 15/16. About 1.18
million shares were traded, 30 times the company's normal volume of
36,000. Teva's American depositary receipts, each representing one
share, closed at 48 1/8, up 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Teva, which had $430 milion in revenues from its US operations
last year, said the acquisition of Copley, which reported $133
million in revenues in 1998, will help it create the country's
largest generic drug maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the US, Teva products will fill one out of every 16
prescriptions at retail pharmacies,'' said William A. Fletcher,
president of Teva USA, based in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Both Copley and Teva officials declined to discuss possible
layoffs or management changes. Terreri said he expects Copley,
which employs 460 people, will lose its corporate name. He said the
deal will probably close in October or November, following a
required review by the Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Hoechst still faces a series of legal challenges in connection
with its stake in Copley. Last May, two Copley shareholders accused
the German company of mismanaging Copley, causing the company's
shares to fall. Copley sales in the past three years have shrunk 6
percent, falling to $133.5 million last year. Last summer, two
Copley directors resigned, and one of them, Agnes Varis, blamed
Hoechst for causing a ``steady decline'' in Copley stock.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner did Hoechst acquire its majority stake in Copley in
1993 than the company issued a recall of its albuterol drug, used
to treat asthma, after bacteria contamination caused by
manufacturing problems was found in some bottles.
</P>
<P>
   The firm was found negligent for not reporting the problem
sooner to the FDA and in 1997 paid a $10.65 million fine for
failing to tell the FDA about changes it made in drug production.
The fine is the largest ever paid by a generic drug maker. In 1995,
Copley settled a series of class-action lawsuits with users of the
asthma drug for $65 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Copley today is a very different company,'' said David F.
Saks, senior drug analyst and managing director of Gruntal &AMP; Co., a
New York investment firm. ``And looking back, Hoechst paid an
obscene price, and they are glad to get rid of it. But Copley has
only been rejuvenated in the last two years and that's what
probably appealed to Teva.''

MILOSEVIC HUDDLES WITH PARTY AS CHURCH BACKS OPPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ President Slobodan Milosevic attended a
rare strategy meeting of his Socialist Party here Tuesday
afternoon, apparently in response to the growing opposition
movement against him. A government reshuffle may be in the offing,
although Radio Television Serbia's report on the meeting revealed
no significant developments.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president has found himself under increasing
pressure, as the notoriously divided Serbian opposition parties and
leaders have begun to show a new will to unite to remove him from
power. The Serbian Orthodox Church has added its weight, bringing
key opposition leaders together Monday and giving its backing to
their plans for democratic change in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Holy Synod, the highest body of the church, convened Tuesday
to discuss the church's role in political developments. Pushed by
outspoken members of the church in Kosovo, who have denounced
Milosevic's disastrous and cruel policies in the southern province,
the church is poised to take a prominent role in the move for
change in the country. The synod is expected to issue a statement
Wednesday on the results of its meeting.
</P>
<P>
   State media have been quick to criticize the opposition's
attempts to win the backing of the church. The state news agency,
Tanjug, and the main government newspaper Politika, denounced the
meeting, saying the opposition leaders ``are practically inducing
the church to violate the constitution,'' which they said
stipulates that the church is forbidden to engage in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Socialist Party repeated its standard criticism of the
opposition politicians at its meeting Tuesday, calling them
``NATO's lackeys'' who are trying to bring down the government and
so achieve what NATO failed with its bombing campaign, RTS
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the party apparently intends to continue business as usual.
It appointed two new members to its executive council but otherwise
announced no changes in tactics or its program.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition groups meanwhile announced after Monday's meeting
that they will join forces for a mass rally planned for Aug. 19 in
Belgrade, and they pressed Patriarch Pavle, the head of the Serbian
Orthodox Church, to take part in a demonstration of unity with the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Holy Synod was considering Tuesday whether the patriarch
should attend the rally in person, and whether to meet another
request, to attempt to mediate between the government and the
opposition to find a political settlement, the Beta news agency
said, quoting opposition members.
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 19 rally is being organized by independent economists,
Mladjan Dinkic and Predrag Markovic, the creators of the Stability
Pact for Serbia, and is intended to unify the opposition movement
and channel the mood for change in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Patriarch Pavle chaired the meeting Monday of the key opposition
leaders, including Democratic Party leader, Zoran Djindjic, and Vuk
Draskovic, the head of the Serbian Renewal Movement. It will be the
first time in over two years that the two men will share a platform
together. Their bitter personal rivalry was blamed for the collapse
of the democratic movement in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders are united in calling for a peaceful demonstration,
and for the need for a transition government. Yet they remain
divided on how to bring it about and on the form of that
government. The authors of the Stability Pact for Serbia, and
others, in a plan that has the backing of the United States, insist
Milosevic must step down before any transition government can take
over.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party leader Zoran Djindjic is hoping the rally
itself will build a momentum of its own, describing it as ``a kind
of a referendum where people will have a chance to say whether they
are for changes.'' He warned that no compromise was possible with
Milosevic. ``After the 19th, Milosevic will have to realize that he
is out of time, it is the day when the countdown begins,'' he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But Draskovic questions how Milosevic's removal will come about.
He is arguing for a transitional government that includes some sort
of power-sharing deal with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Patriarch Pavle I oppose a government which would be
formed on the streets. We will not support such a government,
because it would deepen the agony and the divisions among the
Serbian people,'' he told reporters after Monday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The patriarch also met separately Monday with former Yugoslav
army chief of staff, Gen. Momcilo Perisic, who has founded his own
political party, the Movement for Democratic Serbia. Perisic, who
was dismissed from his post eight months ago, has called for
democratic change and for Milosevic to step down.
</P>
<P>
   The general has been criticized for not joining one of the
myriad existing democratic parties, but he could prove a potent
political figure amid the swelling ranks of the opposition
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition rallies have continued daily around the country
although attendance at some is only in the hundreds. The Aug. 19
rally, expected to draw thousands, will be watched as a measure of
the urgency of public discontent.

FRIENDS' ADVENTURE ENDS IN STABBING DEATH IN N.M. DESERT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM AND CARLOS MONJE JR.  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Coughlin and Raffi Kodikian were on the adventure of a
lifetime, traveling cross-country together like characters in a
Jack Kerouac novel, a big carefree trip before new responsibilities
set in.
</P>
<P>
   But the adventure ended Massachusetts pair last week when their
travels took them to a remote corner of southeastern New Mexico. In
the scorching Carlsbad Caverns National Park, Kodikian, 25, stabbed
Coughlin, 26, twice in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian told police that after killing his friend he buried his
body and stayed close to the shallow grave until rangers found him
on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian said he and his friend had gotten lost, believed they
were dying of thirst, and that Coughlin, in unbearable pain, had
begged Kodikian to put him out of his misery.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian, a former Boston Globe editorial assistant, was charged
with an open count of murder Monday because authorities have not
determined how serious the charge against him should be.
</P>
<P>
   Following his arraignment on the open count Tuesday, Kodikian
was released on $50,000 bail and ordered not to leave the county.
</P>
<P>
   When rangers found Kodikian in a lean-to on Sunday evening, he
was suffering from dehydration and exposure.
</P>
<P>
   According to his mother Doris Kodikian who spoke with Kodikian
after his arrest, he asked rangers: ``What took you so long?''
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian led park rangers to his friend's buried body and told
them he had killed Coughlin after they both becane convinced they
were going to die.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin died from two knife wounds to the chest, one of which
pierced his heart, said Albuquerque medical examiner Tim Stepetic.
There were no signs of a struggle, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not determined what condition Coughlin was in
before Kodikian stabbed him. That will not be determined for a few
days, if ever, Stepetic said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Wellesley, Mass. Tuesday, a half-dozen cars stood
outside the home of Coughlin's parents, Robert and Joyce Coughlin.
``My family is grieving,'' said a male family member who declined
to give his name. ``We'd like some privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said the couple had three grown children _ David, his
brother and a sister.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago Coughlin quit his job at Wellesley Town Hall and
was moving to California where he planned to study for a master's
degree in environmental science at the University of California at
Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   The road trip was to be a last hurrah before Coughlin began
dealing with the pressures of graduate studies, said Sandy Hobson,
who worked with Coughlin at Wellesley Town Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was looking forward to that trip,'' she said. ``All the
places he was going to stop and see. He had been born in Wellesley
and he just wanted to spread his wings and see the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The sandy haired, freckled, blue-eyed Coughlin, Hobson added,
was handsome, funny and popular at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all still in shock. We're trying to rationalize it but
it's impossible,'' said chief Wellesley assessor Donna McCabe. ``He
touched all of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin began working for the town four years ago while
studying resource economics at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst. After graduating in 1996, he worked in the selectmen's
office as a liaison between residents and town planners.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a wonderful sense of humor,'' said Planning Director
Richard H. Brown. ``There was a free and easy-going sense about
him, yet he was still very serious about his work.''
</P>
<P>
   So well-liked was Coughlin that a couple of weeks ago town
officials held a party to wish the former employee good luck on his
cross-country trip.
</P>
<P>
   His admitted killer was equally well-liked, impressing
co-workers at the Boston Globe where we worked as an editorial
assistant for about two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed happy, energetic, eager to please,'' said Linda
Matchan, a Globe reporter who edited his writing in 1996.``He had a
sweet nature, laughed a lot, and was very conscientious.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Globe, Kodikian wrote a first person account
of a cross-country trip he had taken alone in 1997 after graduating
with honors from Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid the excitement of the road had been run down,
paved over, washed away,'' he wrote. ``Still, I knew I had to
travel that road to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote an article for the Globe on the virtues of snakes
as pets; he owned a red tail boa. Matchan said he took editing
suggestions well and his writing improved.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, Kodikian played drums in a band that appeared in
clubs around Boston, but he gave up music when the opportunity came
to go on his first road trip, said Jonathan Pape, a fellow
bandmember.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a friend of Kerouac,'' Pape said. ``He loved the road,
that was nirvana for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Pape, who also worked with Kodikian at the Globe as an editorial
assistant, said Kodikian could ``fly off the handle if things
didn't go the way he wanted at times, but a day later he'd turn
around and help you move. He went out of the way to be helpful. He
was the consummate sidekick.''
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian was known as much for his trademark thick ponytail as
for his personality. Lately, Pape said Kodikian had spoken of
cutting off that ponytail _ a symbol of youthful rebellion _ and
entering a new, mature stage in his life. He was going to send it
to his father to show him he was now growing up. His hair was short
at his arraignment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian worked in the correspondence department at
Massachusetts Financial Services a Boston investment firm, Pape
said. Another friend, Colin Hesketh, who works for the Globe web
site Boston.Com, said Kodikian was considering leaving his job and
moving to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin's co-workers said he delayed his trip so that his good
friend, Kodikian, could join him.
</P>
<P>
   The two arrived at Carlsbad Aug. 4, setting up camp in
Rattlesnake Canyon, in the Chihuahuan Desert. Park rangers say they
were scheduled to leave the park Aug. 6 and a search was begun
Sunday. They found Kodikian a mile from the nearest road and two
miles from the park's visitor center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlsbad does get hotter than hell down there,'' said
Stepetic. ``It seems they weren't prepared for that heat.''

CHANCE MEETING MAY HAVE LED TO TREASURY PLUNDER, PAPERS SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It was a chance meeting of two old Malden school
friends at a Frankie Valle concert on the Esplanade two years ago
that eventually led to a multimillion-dollar scheme to plunder the
state Treasury, according to an affidavit released in Boston
Municipal Court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   John P. Trischitta, the supervisor in the Treasury's Unpaid
Check Fund, told investigators from Attorney General Thomas F.
Reilly's office last February that after meeting his chum, Martin
Robbins, again after about 30 years apart they worked out a scheme
to plunder the fund, the affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   That scheme resulted in Trischitta in November 1998 steering
$6.5 million in funds due to a defunct Cambridge economic
development agency to Robbins on the basis of forged documents that
contended he represented the agency, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   On Trischitta's recommendation, Robbins had started an heir
finders' business in early 1998 that sought to locate missing state
revenue for companies and individuals. However, investigators have
found that Robbins gained the release of several of the checks on
the basis of fraudulent documents and, according to Trischitta,
shared some of the stolen money with him.
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta and Robbins were arrested last February in connection
with the scheme. In early March, Reilly's investigators arrested
Deputy State Treasurer Robert Foley and a second heir finder,
Thomas Ciliberto, for carrying out a similar scheme, in gaining the
release of more than $2 million in checks from the Unpaid Checks
Fund on the basis of fraudulent documents.
</P>
<P>
   While the arrest warrants were dropped two months ago, a grand
jury continues to sit on the investigation in Suffolk County and,
according to informed sources, indictments are expected in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme began to unravel last Feb. 10 when a BankBoston
teller became curious about Robbins' attempt to withdraw the $6.5
million he had deposited in his account at the bank in November.
Within 48 hours, Trischitta provided State Police investigators
with the details of his alleged scheme with Robbins as well as his
knowledge of Foley's dealings. The details also provided the basis
for four State Police affidavits, one of which was released
Tuesday, which were used to search for evidence in Robbins'
condominium in New Hampshire and Trischitta's home in Stoneham.
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta said that he had been an acquaintance of Robbins'
when the two were in separate high schools in Malden. Both were
interested in sports and Trischitta arranged for sports figures to
appear on a cable television station Robbins ran in Malden.
</P>
<P>
   After not seeing each other for decades, Trischitta said, he ran
into Robbins at the Frankie Valle and the Four Seasons performance.
A few months later, in January 1998, Trischitta said, Robbins
called him while he was at work and the two began talking about the
heir finder business.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, Trischitta was funneling to Robbins lists of the
names of companies and individuals who were owed money by the
state, and Robbins was submitting claims on the behalf of many of
them, according to the affidavit. In return, Trischitta said
Robbins paid him about $50,000 in ``kickbacks'' and had promised
him a one-third of the $6.5 million stolen with the Cambridge
Economic Development checks.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that Trischitta approved Robbins' claim for the
$6.5 million owed to the Cambridge agency, he also approved claims
for payment of far smaller checks which were due to Data General,
Brigham &AMP; Women's Hospital, and a group called High School/High
Skills. The investigators have been poring through those claims as
well as others submitted by Robbins to determine if they may have
been forged.

STOCK FALL BROADLY, BUT RECOUP SOME LOSSES LATE IN SESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices staged a broad retreat Tuesday on
continued worries about rising interest rates. A late recovery
brought major market averages up from their lows for the session,
preventing what was a bad day from being even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Selling was broad-based, and the pace of business was fairly
brisk for a Tuesday in August, conditions that traders and analysts
said do not bode well for the market in the near term.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are probably in a very oversold condition,'' said Ned
Collins, head equity trader at Daiwa Securities America. ``But that
doesn't mean we can't be further oversold. This is not necessarily
a great time to think about markets rallying.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for a time Tuesday, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index was technically in a correction, having fallen 10 percent
from its July 16 high of 1418.18.
</P>
<P>
   But the index, which fell as low as 1,267.73 during the day,
bounced, and closed at 1,281.43, down 16.37 points, or 1.3 percent.
So far this year, the S&AMP;P 500 is up 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Weakness in IBM and J.P. Morgan were instrumental in driving
down the Dow Jones industrial average, which closed at 10,655.15,
down 52.55 points, or 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A late rebound in Internet stocks helped to limit the decline in
the NASDAQ composite index. Still, at the close the index was down
28.87 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,490.11. Earlier in the day the
composite index had traded as low as 2,442.22.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the late swing in some stocks, there were plenty of
signs of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization companies fell
3.07 points, or 0.7 percent, to 422.82. And the combination of
higher interest rates and rising energy prices hammered
transportation stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones transportation average fell 82.91 points, or 2.6
percent, to 3,137.54. The average peaked May 12 and has now fallen
more than 17 percent from its all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   Airline stocks were hard-hit. AMR, the parent of American
Airlines, fell 2 1/16, to 59 5/16. UAL, the parent of United
Airlines, dropped 15/16, to 59. Delta Airlines shed 2|, to 53|.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies, a high-flying component of the S&AMP;P 500
index, helped to drag the index down after it announced it had
agreed to buy International Network, a computer network integrator,
for $3.7 billion. Lucent fell 2[, to 61.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, which is Lucent's main competitor in data
networking, was the most actively traded stock Tuesday. It fell 1
1/16, to 58}, only to rebound in after-hours trading after
releasing healthy second-quarter profit numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in interest rates hammered financial service company
stocks. J.P. Morgan led the Dow index down, falling 3, to 121
15/16. Chase Manhattan dropped 1 5/16, to 74 5/16. And Merrill
Lynch fell 13/16, to 63 11/16.

 &HT;    Falcons camp: No Anderson, no meeting
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Falcons coach Dan Reeves and general manager
Harold Richardson hope to meet today with holdout Jamal Anderson
and his agent in an attempt to get the All-Pro running back in
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   But as of late Tuesday afternoon, neither Reeves nor Richardson
had heard anything specific from Jim Sims, who represents Anderson
in his attempt to gain a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Sims called team officials Monday and said he wants to sit down
with Anderson, Reeves and Richardson. Sims, whose office is in
Oakland, said he could not make it to Greenville until Wednesday.
However, he and Anderson arrived in Atlanta about 5:30 a.m. Monday,
according to the flight records of Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   With a larger-than-usual media contingent around the Falcons'
training camp on the Furman University campus, Reeves seemed irked
with Anderson's agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to have had this done a month ago, so,
hopefully, we'll get something done,'' Reeves said. ``If they want
more publicity, we're doing a good job of giving it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves noted that Anderson is not the only player entering the
final year of his contract. Fifteen veterans back from last year's
team stand to become unrestricted free agents after this season; 10
of them are starters. All of those players are in camp.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, quarterback Chris Chandler was in camp while his
agent worked to complete a five-year, $27 million contract with a
$6 million signing bonus. The deal was signed two days before the
season opened.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who has accumulated nearly $70,000 in fines for
missing training camp and a mini-camp last month, has said he will
ask to be traded if he is not satisfied with the Falcons' offer.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves has said repeatedly that Anderson won't be dealt. ``We'll
meet with them, and (Anderson) won't get traded,'' he said again
Tuesday.

3 ALUMINUM COMPANIES IN MERGER TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphics showing the price of aluminum and the partners
in the possible three-way merger are being sent to NYT graphic
clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling

(lh) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Alcan Aluminium of Canada, Pechiney of France and the
Alsuisse Lonza Group of Switzerland confirmed Tuesday that they are
in merger talks that could create the biggest company in the
aluminum industry, a business plagued for nearly a decade by
oversupply and depressed prices.
</P>
<P>
   The potential combination may be a signal of other big
cross-border deals and could lead to stable or higher prices for
aluminum, a basic industrial metal.
</P>
<P>
   Although executives of the companies said they were still in
discussions and an agreement was not certain, their talks were a
vivid illustration of how corporate consolidation is occurring on a
global scale.
</P>
<P>
   The three-way combination under consideration would create an
aluminum and packaging giant with more than $26 billion in annual
revenue, easily eclipsing the $15.5 billion in revenue of the
current No. 1, Alcoa of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies make aluminum used in products ranging from
aircraft bodies to cooking foil, as well as packaging for drugs and
food. In addition, the Swiss company, informally known as Algroup,
has a profitable specialty chemicals division, which probably would
be sold if the merger talks succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The aluminum business has been badly depressed since the early
'90s, when the collapse of the Soviet Union, one of the biggest
producers of aluminum, led to undisciplined selling by Russian
exporters in a quest for foreign currency. Aluminum supplies
surged, and prices fell. The supply glut was aggravated during the
last two years by severe economic problems in Asia, Russia and
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, mergers in the automotive and aircraft industries
have created huge global customers with the buying power to keep
prices low.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, world aluminum prices have fallen about 30 percent since
the late '80s and touched a five-year low in March, hurting the
earnings of big producers and raising pressure on them to find
partners.
</P>
<P>
   In brief identical statements, Alcan Aluminium, Pechiney and
Algroup would only say that they were in discussions regarding a
``potential business combination.'' News of their discussions was
reported Tuesday in The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are talks, there have been talks, but there's no deal
yet,'' said Marcel Barthe, a spokesman for Alcan Aluminium, at the
company's headquarters in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The talks come against a backdrop of mergers in other metals
industries, which have all been hurt in varying degrees by low
prices. In June, British Steel agreed to acquire the Dutch
steelmaker Royal Hoogovens for $2.3 billion, and last year two of
Germany's biggest steelmakers joined to form Thyssen Krupp AG.
</P>
<P>
   But announced deals have unraveled, too. Indeed, Algroup last
year announced year an $8.7 billion deal to merge with Viag AG, the
German utility and aluminum maker, but the deal collapsed. Earlier,
two big Swiss chemical producers, Ciba Specialty Chemicals AG and
Clariant AG, canceled an agreed-upon stock swap.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the deals that succeeded reflect a new-found
attention to shareholder value among European corporations, many of
which number among their major shareholders large American and
British pension funds, keen on returns. But many deals simply
reflect the volatility of commodity prices, and the need to gain
scale and reduce costs to inject a measure of stability into the
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see the potential to unlock value, so that everyone comes
away a winner,'' said Peter Davey, an analyst at Societe Generale
Securities. Through the companies' mixture of primary aluminum
production, packaging and other activities varied, he said, there
was sufficient overlap to justify consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Weber, an analyst at Bank Vontobel in Zurich, Switzerland,
agreed. ``Pechiney and Alusuisse have food, pharmaceutical and
cosmetic packaging operations that overlap, and both Alusuisse and
Alcan have aluminum plants in eastern Switzerland,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, officials for both Alcoa and the Aluminum
Association trade group declined to comment on such a merger's
impact.
</P>
<P>
   But investors clearly thought a merger represented good news,
with the creation of a huge global manufacturer that would not
necessarily have to cut prices to thrive. That would inject some
stability into the market and perhaps lead to higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very big positive for the entire aluminum
industry,'' said Daniel A. Roling, an analyst with Merrill Lynch
Global Securities.

<P>
   In Paris, shares in Pechiney rose by 4.8 percent to 54.20 euros,
or $58.19, while Algroup's shares rose 4.8 percent to 1,828 Swiss
francs, or $1,226, on the Zurich bourse. In Toronto, shares in
Alcan rose 6.2 percent to 50.50 Canadian dollars or $33.43.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa shares rose 81.25 cents to $66.4375 on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Though such a deal could face formidable obstacles, including
possible anti-monopoly challenges by European Union regulators, who
said Tuesday that they had been informed of the talks last week, it
is expected to set off a scramble for partners among smaller
aluminum producers, like Hoogovens of the Netherlands, Norsk Hydro
of Norway, and the VAW Aluminum subsidiary of Germany's Viag.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal that the companies are looking at,
Pechiney and Algroup shareholders are expected to receive shares of
Alcan in exchange for their stock. The planned combination would
have its headquarters in Montreal and would be headed by Alcan's
president and chief executive, Jacques Bougie. Jean-Pierre Rodi,
Pechiney's chief executive, is expected to be named chief operating
officer.
</P>
<P>
   All three companies have similar activities, producing primary
aluminum from basic raw materials and then turning it into such
products as rolled aluminum and ingots from which aluminum products
are made. But Alcan, which hired Morgan Stanley Dean Witter as its
adviser in the discussions, is by far the most profitable of the
three, yielding pretax profits equivalent to 10.5 percent of
revenues, compared to 9.6 percent at Algroup and 6.6 percent at
Pechiney. Pechiney has been using Credit Suisse First Boston and
Algroup Goldman Sachs as advisers.

NAVY MOVES TO RESUME TIES WITH TAILHOOK ASSOCIATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Navy took its first step Tuesday to restore
official ties with the Tailhook Association, eight years after
sexual assaults and drunken revelry at the group's annual
convention roiled the Navy and led to changes in the military's
treatment of women.
</P>
<P>
   While stopping short of fully embracing the association, the
Navy said it would resume its formal support once it received
assurances that the group's leaders would never again tolerate the
sort of behavior that made the name Tailhook shorthand for
disrespect and mistreatment of women in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The Tailhook Association, which is based in San Diego, has
10,500 members, including retired and active-duty pilots, and acts
as a sort of booster club for carrier-based aviation. Although the
group is private, its members and activities up until 1991 were
closely associated to the Navy and its officer corps, particularly
those who had flown from aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Tuesday to the group's president, Navy Secretary
Richard Danzig welcomed ``a number of constructive steps'' the
association had taken since ``the shameful events'' of the 1991
convention, where 83 women, some in the Navy, reported being
assaulted or harassed in a Las Vegas hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig said those steps, including the adoption of resolutions
condemning harassment and promoting equality, merited a
reconsideration of its pariah status. He announced he would send
three senior Navy and Marine Corps officials to monitor this year's
convention, which begins Aug. 19 in Sparks, Nev., and after that
make a final decision on restoring ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to assess the extent to which the association lives by
these principles and has the potential to reflect in its membership
the charge and profile of today's _ and the future's _ naval
aviation community,'' said Danzig.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Russian forces continued to do battle with Islamic
militants in the mountains of the North Caucasus, Vladimir Putin,
the newly designated prime minister, said Tuesday that he had
proposed a ``package of measures'' to bring the volatile situation
under control.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from a morning meeting with President Boris Yeltsin,
who Monday anointed him as the Kremlin candidate in presidential
elections next year, Putin, the former head of Russia's domestic
intelligence service, said he hoped that these measures would quell
the Islamic fundamentalist insurrection within weeks. He did not
say what the measures were.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Islamic militants set off the crisis by crossing
the Chechen border into the neighboring Russian province of
Dagestan and seizing several mountain villages. Tuesday they issued
a statement declaring Dagestan's independence as an Islamic state,
and vowing to drive away ``infidels'' from its territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Dagestani authorities, who recently called in the Russian
army to help them fend off the threat of armed Islamic militants,
dismissed the statement as propaganda, and said it had no support
from the local population.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation in the North Caucasus promises to be the top
issue facing Putin, as he tries to prove to Yeltsin, and the
country, that he has the leadership qualities he needs to make a
serious run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real test of his ability will be the Caucasus,'' said
Andrei Piontkovsky, head of the Center for Strategic Studies in
Moscow. ``There is no clear-cut strategy now, and it will be
necessary to take very difficult decisions. In the end, it is not a
military problem, but a political problem, the same one every
Muslim state faces with its fundamentalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Unrest and lawlessness in the North Caucasus have been one of
Moscow's major security concerns since the 1994-1996 war in
Chechnya, which ended with the defeat of Russia's undisciplined and
demoralized federal forces.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Chechnya has in effect seceded from Russia, although
its independence has not been formally recognized.
</P>
<P>
   In Dagestan on Tuesday, Russian troops from both the army and
the Interior Ministry continued their attacks on the rebel
strongholds in the southwestern part of the province. Most
civilians had evacuated the villages Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the remote region were sketchy, and at times
contradictory. According to some reports, militants have been
forced out of some villages, but it is not clear where they went.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, Lt. Col. Anatoly Kornukov,
commander of the Russian air force, said that three air regiments
were involved in the campaign, and that so far, 78 reconnaissance
and attack sorties had been flown.
</P>
<P>
   Kornukov said the militants have sustained heavy losses from the
air strikes, and that some have retreated, but he gave no
specifics. In the first day of fighting, a Russian airplane
accidentally struck a police station near one of the rebel bases,
killing several Dagestani policemen.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Dagestani interior minister, a Russian air
force officer was killed Monday in a mortar attack, four soldiers
were wounded and two military helicopters were burned.
</P>
<P>
   Kornukov denied charges made Monday by the government of nearby
Georgia that Russian airplanes had bombed a Georgian village.
Kornukov said Russian planes had not violated Georgian air space,
but suggested that bombs dropped along the commandoes' escape route
might have been carried overland into Georgia as a provocation.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts Tuesday, attempting to make sense of Yeltsin's
sudden decision to dump his last prime minister, Sergei Stepashin,
concluded that the president had found Putin to be a tougher, more
resolute leader.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Monday by Yeltsin how his mood was as he took over his new
job, Putin _ who began his career as a KGB officer _ answered
curtly: ``combative.'' Putin's nomination goes to the Parliament's
lower house next Monday, where he is expected to be confirmed by
deputies eager to concentrate on their reelection campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Federal Security Service, and secretary of the
Kremlin's advisory Security Council, Putin was already deeply
involved in Moscow's campaign in the Caucasus, and it is still not
clear whether his plan of action, presented Tuesday, will differ
from the course taken by the Stepashin government.
</P>
<P>
   In his parting comments to the Cabinet on Monday, Stepashin, who
returned Sunday night from a trip to Dagestan to oversee the
operation, said the coordination between the various forces,
including army and Interior Ministry troops, was poor. ''I had to
fly there and say that I was taking the responsibility myself,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to news reports, the Islamic commandoes _ adherents of
the so-called Wahhabi fundamentalist sect which has been gaining
strength across Russia's northern caucasian region _ are led by
Shamil Basayev, a field commander who became a Chechen hero during
the war with Russia, and by Hattab, a shadowy Jordanian-born
guerrilla fighter who has established a military training camp in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Wattabi sect has already made inroads into Dagestan, a
region made of 33 different, mainly Muslim, ethnic groups, but in
other villages, their presence has been tolerated by authorities.
Even if Russia's latest military operations succeeded in pushing
out the latest wave of militants, the problem of rising Islamic
militancy _ fueled by poverty and local corruption _ will remain,
some experts say.
</P>
<P>
   In the Chechen capital of Grozny, the president, Aslan
Maskhadov, insisted that Chechnya is not involved in the fight
being waged on its border, which he called a ``dirty game''
probably instigated by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building an independent Chechen state rather than waging new
wars is our most important jihad'' or holy war, at the moment, said
Maskhadov, whose authority at home has been undercut by warlords
like Basayev who have forged links with religious fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   As Putin tried to bring the complex situation in the Caucasus
under control, politicians in Moscow were scrambling to position
themselves for the political season, officially opened Monday by
Yeltsin. Parliamentary elections are to be held in December and
presidential elections are due next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin _ who until Monday had been seen as a possible Kremlin
favorite in the presidential race _ was being courted Tuesday by
right-wing political parties, headed by the reformers who were once
part of Yeltsin's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepashin has a political future,'' said Sergei Kiriyenko,
another former prime minister. ``Such people must not be wasted. I
consider it right that he lead a center-right bloc.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergence last week of a center-left bloc put together
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and several powerful regional governors,
a group perceived as hostile to the Kremlin's interests, is widely
seen as a catalyst for Yeltsin's decision to fire Stepashin and
replace him with someone who will be more forceful in protecting
the Yeltsin legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts Tuesday suggested that by firing Stepashin,
Yeltsin may have freed him to become a presidential candidate in
his own right, one who would not be burdened with an endorsement by
a deeply unpopular president, but who would still be loyal to
Yeltsin's personal interests, as well as his program.

GM DOUBTS IT WILL GAIN AUTO MARKET SHARE SOON; PLANS WEB UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ General Motors Corp. executives conceded Tuesday that
the company would be unable to increase its share of the booming
auto market soon. They also announced that the company would bundle
its Internet-related assets together in a single unit called e-GM.
</P>
<P>
   The giant automaker has watched its market share slide for
decades, but as recently as July executives had vowed to regain the
30 percent level. Instead, its share of the market sank to 28.4
percent in July. Tuesday, executives said that GM's factories were
running flat out to build as many cars and trucks as possible and
that GM could not produce enough vehicles to increase its market
share as long as customers continued to buy them at a pace of 17
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is so strong it is impossible to produce more
vehicles at the moment,'' said GM chairman and chief executive John
Smith at a new conference.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Zarrella, president of GM's North American operations,
said, ``We're making absolutely every product we can make at every
plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Some on Wall Street expressed skepticism about Zarrella's
assertion, saying that GM simply did not have enough factories
devoted to building its most popular models _ sport utility
vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans _ though it had excess
capacity for building cars. ``Its truck plants are indeed running
full out,'' said John Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``It
still has too much capacity devoted to products that are not
selling well.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, GM has earned substantial profits recently. In the
second quarter alone, it earned $1.73 billion from continuing
operations, up from $306 million in the corresponding period last
year, when a strike nearly shut the company.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference was called to announce the new business
group, e-GM, comprising all GM Internet initiatives worldwide,
including Web sites and a program called Onstar, which uses
satellites to link motorists to GM staff members 24 hours a day for
assistance in the event of accidents or just to locate nearby gas
stations or restaurants. The Internet unit will also lead efforts
to integrate electronic commerce through all the company's business
lines and back-office functions.
</P>
<P>
   GM president and chief operating officer G. Richard Wagoner Jr.
said that issuing a separate tracking stock for the unit or
spinning it off in a public offering was ``not on the radar screen
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-GM unit will join with technology companies to provide
more products and services to GM customers, executives said.
``We're talking to all the big players,'' Zarrella said. ``We bring
a huge customer base.''
</P>
<P>
   GM named Mark Hogan, who was vice president of small-car
operations, to lead the unit. He has kept a low profile since
enraging the United Automobile Workers union this spring by pushing
for streamlined assembly processes in new GM factories. The union
feared that this approach, called modular assembly, would cost
jobs, and UAW president Stephen Yokich publicly called for Hogan to
be dismissed for advocating the moves.
</P>
<P>
   The e-GM initiative is similar to moves under way at other
automakers. At DaimlerChrysler AG, for example, a $500 million
technology program called Customer Connect is meant to link
customers and dealers worldwide through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 61, who has made few high-profile public appearances
lately, sat in the audience Tuesday for the e-GM announcement by
Wagoner and Zarrella. He took questions afterward, however, and
among other topics fended off rumors that he might soon retire,
saying he had no plans to do so.

AIR PASSENGER'S EXPLETIVE LANDS HER IN COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Fla.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a courthouse this morning, Miami resident Patricia
Lemerise will defend herself on criminal charges that stem, she
believes, from one key fact: that she used a one-word expletive to
a flight attendant.
</P>
<P>
   Her case, of course, is more complex than that. It's a tale of
in-flight tension between passenger and airline crew that started
with grumbling, escalated into swearing, and reached a crescendo
when Massachusetts state troopers met her at the airplane door.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, her travel agent informed her that American Airlines
had banned her for life from their flights.
</P>
<P>
   They wouldn't even refund her ticket back to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But the curse word _ and the treatment, by airline employees,
that Lemerise says provoked it _ is at the heart of the conflict
that landed her in jail last Thursday, charged with disorderly
conduct and interfering with a flight crew.
</P>
<P>
   Lemerise, who will be represented by a public defender in East
Boston District Court, said she can't believe she could go to jail
``for being in a bad mood'' during a flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't threaten anybody,'' she said. ``I didn't beat anybody
up. . . . I didn't put my hands on anybody's person.''
</P>
<P>
   But her story comes at a time of increased tension in air
travel, when passengers are lodging more complaints about the
airlines, and airline employees are citing a rise in unruly _ and
threatening _ behavior.
</P>
<P>
   After a few vivid examples of passenger violence, many carriers
have established ``zero tolerance'' policies, promising to
prosecute disruptive fliers. But passengers complain of being
herded like cattle, crammed into shrinking seats, snapped at, lied
to, and subjected to treatment that makes frustration boil into
anger.
</P>
<P>
   So the events that unfolded on American Airlines Flight 2040,
nonstop from Miami to Logan International Airport last Thursday,
could be viewed as yet another tale from the battle front.
</P>
<P>
   Lemerise, 28, an art dealer, said she had already had a lousy
day by the time she boarded the plane in Miami at around 11 a.m.
Her wallet had been stolen that morning. She was tired. She wasn't
in the mood for a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Midway into the 2 1/2-hour flight, when she rose from her window
seat in row 25 and stepped into the aisle to roll up some artwork
that had become crumpled during transport. At the time, the flight
attendants were about to push the meal cart to the front of the
plane, and Lemerise was blocking their path.
</P>
<P>
   A nearby passenger, Michele Haft Hudson, said she overheard one
attendant tell another that Lemerise ``had better get her butt back
in her seat, because if she gets stuck, that's her problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemerise said a flight attendant told her to move to an empty
aisle seat. But by the time she got there, the occupant had
returned from the restroom, so she walked to the first-class
section and stood between the cockpit and the kitchen, waiting for
the meal cart to pass her row.
</P>
<P>
   Three times, Lemerise said, she walked down the aisle to try to
slip past the meal cart. Each time, she said, the flight attendant
wouldn't let her through.
</P>
<P>
   After her third attempt, Lemerise recalled, she turned to the
flight attendant in first class and said, ``I guess you're stuck
with me for another (expletive) 20 minutes, because it seems that
I'm under punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendant curtly told Lemerise that the word she used
_ the f-word _ was forbidden on an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Lemerise answered that she was exercising her First Amendment
rights. The flight attendant then reported her to the captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked in construction for the last nine years,''
Lemerise said in an interview this week. The ephithet ``is not such
a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, Lemerise, who said she felt like a chastened
schoolgirl, was arguing with the attendants. Then, an off-duty
pilot, who was sitting in first class, joined the verbal fray,
defending the flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Lemerise said the pilot jabbed his finger at her. She said she
used the word again, in a sentence that went about like this:
``Tell the (expletive) stewardess to get out of my way and I will
gladly go back to my seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemerise said she demanded the name of the pilot; a flight
attendant refused to give it. So when another flight attendant
asked for her name, Lemerise would not tell her.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the plane landed at Logan, several passengers had
offered their names and phone numbers to flight attendants,
pledging to support them as witnesses. Hudson _ who was incensed by
the crew's nasty behavior towards her own family that day _ said
she'd support Lemerise, and told the attendants that they were
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were so rude,'' Hudson said, ``that they deserved a
passenger response.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached Tuesday, American Airlines spokesman Mark Slitt said he
could not comment on the airline's side of the story. But while
American might not have a specific policy against swearing, he
said, the airline is tough on passenger misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it gets to a point where passenger language makes a flight
attendant feel threatened in some way, or abused in some way . . .
that's something we would find intolerable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants are expected to be polite, but courtesy is a
two-way street, he said. Passengers with complaints should call the
airline's customer relations department and file a report.
</P>
<P>
   Lemerise said she's considering a lawsuit instead.
</P>
<P>
   When the plane landed at Logan, and state troopers hauled her to
the airport barracks in handcuffs, Lemerise said, she was in tears.
But by the time she was released on $50 bond five hours later, she
was angry again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry that promotes this behavior of lying and deceit
and bullying _ they're going on the wrong approach,'' she said.
``You're asking for what you get. you're really asking for what you
get.''
</P>
<P>
   Slitt said Lemerise's barred-for-life status from the airline
``may be as much myth as reality.'' American Airlines has no master
list of forbidden fliers, he said, but when passengers behave
extremely badly, ``we make it very clear to them that we don't want
their business.
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, Lemerise said, the feeling is mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even drive and I'm going to buy a car right now and
drive back to Miami,'' she said. ``I don't even want to go back in
an airport.''

SOROS NAMES EXECUTIVE FOR FUND FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hoping to turn around a dismal performance at his $13
billion hedge fund family, George Soros has picked Duncan Hennes,
the former treasurer of Bankers Trust Corp., to serve as chief
executive, with a mandate to end the personnel turmoil and other
problems that have led to huge investor redemptions over the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   After a long search and interviews with several Wall Street
executives, Soros picked Hennes, 42, to be in charge of hiring,
compensation and other administrative chores and to oversee the
arbitrage operation after the departure three months ago of the
arbitrage specialists.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Hennes will free Soros Fund Management's top
stock picker and chief investment strategist, Stanley
Druckenmiller, who manages the flagship $6.7 billion Quantum Fund,
to spend more time on investments.
</P>
<P>
   Soros officials said Druckenmiller had asked Soros at the
beginning of the year to hire someone to take over administrative
duties because those jobs had become too great a burden. Though he
is recognized as one of the world's leading investors, Soros has
not played an active role in day-to-day investing decisions at the
funds in a decade, focusing his time instead on philanthropic and
other activities.
</P>
<P>
   Hennes' appointment, reported Tuesday in The Wall Street
Journal, also signals a lesser role at the fund family for Gary
Gladstein, a longtime senior Soros executive who previously had
handled some of the duties being assigned to Hennes. Gladstein, a
14-year employee of the Soros operation, had asked earlier that his
duties be cut back, a Soros spokesman said. Gladstein, who did not
return a telephone call seeking comment, is expected to stay.
</P>
<P>
   From 1992 through the end of last year, the Quantum fund
returned more than 400 percent. But so far this year, the fund is
down 11.2 percent, buffeted by a decision to sell Internet stocks
short _ in hopes they would decline _ and by a bullish position on
the single European currency. Instead of playing out the way
portfolio managers had expected, the Internet shares continued to
rise while the euro weakened. The two developments cost the fund
more than 15 percent of its assets.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has also been hurt because of its huge position in
Waste Management Inc., which has suffered through an accounting
scandal that has sent shares down more than 50 percent. But some
other top stock holdings, including stakes in Enron Corp. and
Globalstar Telecommunications Ltd., have performed well recently.
</P>
<P>
   Personnel problems have also plagued the Soros funds lately. In
May, three top analysts who headed the firm's ``special
situations'' investments, including merger arbitrage, departed to
form a new money-management firm, Satellite Asset Management. And
more recently, a half-dozen other Soros analysts have either been
dismissed or quit, departures that a person close to the fund said
were performance-related.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Hennes said that Soros had given him a twofold
mandate: ``To get the operation in order in terms of
administration, and the second challenge is to expand the
franchise, and that's the one which is obviously less defined.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But already clear, he said, is the need to rebuild and expand
the firm's arbitrage operation. One of Hennes' duties at Bankers
Trust was overseeing the division that handled arbitrage.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fallout from the demise of Long-Term Capital
Management LP is 12 months old, he noted, not as much Wall Street
money is chasing merger arbitrage. ``There are some holes out there
that need to be filled,'' he said. Decisions about how much money
to allocate to arbitrage will be made in conjunction with
Druckenmiller, but he said: ``Clearly, we need to hire a new team
there. There may very well be other areas of arbitrage we may want
to get into.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he hoped to expand the private-equity
investments overseen by Frank V. Sica, a former co-head of merchant
banking at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter who joined the Soros group in
May 1998.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Kaoru Ogawa is among the last of a dying breed.
</P>
<P>
   Ogawa is the most prominent of the survivors of the Japanese
government's war on the sokaiya, as Japan's oddly high-profile
corporate extortionists are known.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent shareholders meeting, he proudly introduced himself
as the famous sokaiya who was recently released from jail. But now
even he is turning to other lines of business and seeking to soften
his image. For one thing, he has encouraged shareholders of Japan
Airlines to boycott the company until it gets its business in
order. He even urged executives of Honda Motor to emulate a foreign
auto maker, Daimler-Chrysler, by developing more exciting designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the Japanese Ralph Nader,'' he told the directors of Mazda
Motors during that company's annual meeting in July, when he tried
to make a case for himself as a rather benign ombudsman for
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   That's a stretch. But, in fact, the government's crackdown on
sokaiya (pronounced so-kaiyah) has resulted in a remarkable forced
retrenchment among a group that was formerly so sharp-elbowed that
major corporations paid large sums of money to keep them at bay and
avoid disruptions to their public meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been reduced to a level we can almost ignore,'' said
Hideaki Kubori, a lawyer who helps companies design policies to
keep the sokaiya and other threats away. ``The sokaiya have
operated with an eye toward balancing how much money they get
versus the penalty they might get. These days they've decided
there's no profit in it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   There is resistance, and desperation has forced some sokaiya to
move closer to their criminal cousins, the yakuza. Even Ogawa was
not afraid to warn Japan Airlines that risks remain. ``If
management doesn't improve, then bang, bang, there will be more
shootings,'' he said at the recent meeting, referring to a
mysterious incident at the home of a former airline executive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sokaiya's numbers are shrinking fast, their demise
further evidence of Japan's increasing if grudging embrace of the
global economy, and the premium it places on transparency and sound
corporate governance.
</P>
<P>
   Kubori estimates that 350 to 500 sokaiya remain formally
operating in Japan, somewhat fewer than half the number in 1997.
That was when the government decided to end the business _
technically illegal since 1982 but infrequently prosecuted _ once
and for all by attacking not only the sokaiya but also their hidden
corporate patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the fall of 1977, the police arrested executives from
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and the four major securities firms here. They
also prosecuted Ryuichi Koike, whom authorities describe as Japan's
leading sokaiya, and succeeded in putting him in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that, the sokaiya participated in a variety of
activities, from publishing and other seemingly legitimate
businesses to outright extortion and stock-market manipulation.
Using their ties to the yakuza, Japan's underworld, the sokaiya
gathered damaging information about companies and their executives
and traded on it.
</P>
<P>
   By purchasing a subscription to a poorly written, erratically
published ``newsletter,'' corporations could guarantee themselves
and their directors a harmonious, embarrassment-free shareholders'
meeting, courtesy of sokaiya like Ogawa. Corporate managers were
invited to attend affairs arranged by the sokaiya, where cash was
handed over to guarantee peace.
</P>
<P>
   If a company failed to pay, its shareholders meetings could
degenerate into violent melees and shouting matches, where
directors' sexual and other peccadillos were aired. In
image-conscious Japan, such disturbances could permanently stain a
career and disgust customers.
</P>
<P>
   Today's remaining sokaiya are far more well-behaved. Reporters,
who were allowed to attend Japanese shareholders' meetings this
year in far greater numbers than ever before, were surprised to
discover that Mamoru Tamura, a particularly outspoken shareholder
who had berated the managements of Nissan and Mitsubishi Motor as
well as several financial services companies, is a well-known if
somewhat small-time sokaiya.
</P>
<P>
   To their ears, Tamura sounded a lot like Evelyn Y. Davis or the
Gilbert brothers _ the outspoken, if slightly eccentric, American
shareholder advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Tamura's command of the microphone and his harsh, fact-packed
diatribes, however, were tell-tale clues to his sokaiya status: The
typical Japanese shareholder prefers to hold his tongue, and if he
does speak, is likely to couch his criticism or question in profuse
apology.
</P>
<P>
   That is changing, and police officials credit far-reaching
changes in Japanese society as much as their own efforts for
bringing the sokaiya to their knees. More ordinary shareholders are
speaking out, not necessarily with loud voices and angry invective
but in a critical manner nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Management, too, seems determined to severe its ties to the
sokaiya. ``Ten years ago, presidents of companies were very much
afraid of a sokaiya's performance at their shareholders'
meetings,'' said Makoto Ota, chief of the investigative unit of
Metropolitan Police Department's Organized Crime Control Division.
``It was regarded as a big mistake by the corporate staff and an
embarrassment, but it's not like that so much now.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the line between sokaiya and shareholder advocate is
becoming so blurred that many praise the sokaiya for their efforts
to give shareholders in Japanese companies a voice. ``What I'm
doing is confronting companies and fighting against them,'' Ogawa
said. ``Japanese companies are very bad to their shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubori, the lawyer who helps companies defend themselves against
sokaiya, said appraisals like those, along with rather romanticized
portrayals of the sokaiya in both the Japanese and foreign press,
are helping them recast themselves as a new breed of Japanese-style
shareholder advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters ``now have the impression that Japanese shareholders'
meetings and the sokaiya who attend them are the same as American
shareholders' meetings and the shareholders who attend them,'' he
said. ``They're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Kubori said, the growing pressure is increasingly
pushing them into outright extortion and other criminal acts. ``It
used to be that the shareholder's meeting was the arena for the
battle between corporate Japan and the sokaiya,'' he said. ``Now
the confrontation is spreading throughout the year and going into
different areas of harassment.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The police, for instance, are investigating a mysterious
shooting at the Tokyo home of Matsuo Toshimitsu, a former president
of Japan Airlines, which has long been one of the sokaiya's
favorite targets. Several days before the company's shareholders'
meeting this year, a bullet was fired into the wall near the
entrance of Toshimitsu's house, and traces of another bullet were
found on a window sill.
</P>
<P>
   The police are also looking into a call about the incident from
Eitaro Itoyama, Japan Airlines' biggest individual shareholder.
Even before Toshimitsu had informed the company of the shooting,
Itoyama called executives, demanding to know why the airline was
covering it up. Itoyama, through his secretary, said that he heard
about the shooting from friends in the neighborhood and he only
called the company after failing to see any news reports about it.
</P>
<P>
   Itoyama, a former politician whose career was marred by
financial scandals, has never called himself a sokaiya, though many
of his activities are similar to theirs. His wife is the niece of
Ryoichi Sasakawa, a well-known gangster who died not long ago, and
Itoyama told Bloomberg News this spring that he had relied on the
yakuza for support in elections.
</P>
<P>
   Ogawa, the self-proclaimed Ralph Nader of Japan, is miffed at
the attention Itoyama and Koike, who got his start as one of
Ogawa's lieutenants, have snared in the last two years. Koike, in
particular, has become something of a celebrity since his arrest
and imprisonment in 1997, shortly after the police adopted a
scorched-earth policy toward the sokaiya.
</P>
<P>
   In his own bid for the spotlight after serving jail time on
corporate-racketeering charges, Ogawa posed for pictures astride
the motorcycle he used to navigate Tokyo's perpetually snarled
streets on June 29, the day when the bulk of Japanese companies
held their shareholders' meetings this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese police are portraying the capture of Koike as a
big deal,'' he said when the subject of his rivals came up. ``They
are exaggerating his importance to make themselves look good.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, Ogawa said, in a good year, a prominent sokaiya
could earn up to 150 million yen, or about $1.3 million _ much of
which was tax-free. Times are harder than when he owned three homes
in Hawaii and was the backer for Pink Lady, a teen-aged singing duo
that was wildly popular here in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time leader of the biggest group of sokaiya in Japan,
Ogawa said he plans to start a new company that offers information
and stock tips to ordinary investors via the Internet for an annual
membership fee of 1,000 yen ($87) or so.
</P>
<P>
   He also sees a role for himself as a champion of small and
mid-sized construction companies, which, he said, often have to pay
a ``commission'' to get a piece of the action in the lucrative
public-works contracts that are controlled by the big general
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the small and medium-sized companies cannot pay the
commission, they get a bullet in their house,'' courtesy of the
yakuza who work on behalf of the general contractors, Ogawa said.
He thinks he can offer the smaller contractors protection from the
fees.
</P>
<P>
   He also writes a gossipy column about Japanese companies and
sokaiya for a sports newspaper. Ogawa is an inveterate gambler,
betting on boats, horses and baseball. It was gambling, or rather
gambling losses, that propelled him into the sokaiya business when
he was a young man.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he sees what was for him a proud career ending with a
whimper, not a bang. ``In Japan now, even ordinary shareholders who
speak out at shareholders meetings are now called sokaiya, so who's
really a sokaiya any more?'' he lamented. ``The sokaiya is dead,
there's just no benefit in it any more.''

U.S. FREEZES ASSETS OF AFHAN AIRLINE
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States froze the American assets of the
Afghan national airline on Tuesday, calling it a link in the chain
of support for Osama bin Laden, the suspected terrorist leader now
living in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier, Ariana Afghan Airlines, ``has supported, or is
linked to, the bin Laden network,'' David Leavy, a National
Security Council spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, President Clinton imposed financial and commercial
sanctions against the Taliban, the armed religious group that rules
most of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The government on Tuesday also blocked American business
transactions with Ariania, along with freezing its assets in the
United States, about half a million dollars. The tiny airline has
the only planes with scheduled flights to and from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Although the impact of the actions may be more symbolic than
real, they are aimed at strangling the Taliban, and cutting off all
means of support to bin Laden, who is charged with masterminding
the bombings of two American embassies in Africa a year ago,
disasters that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and
wounded about 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden remains in Afghanistan, reportedly outside Jalalabad,
about 40 miles from the Pakistani border.
</P>
<P>
   The first anniversary of the embassy attacks passed peacefully
on Saturday. But on Tuesday, the State Department issued a warning
that ``extremists based in Afghanistan'' might soon ``attack U.S.
interests in Pakistan,'' urging Americans there to take
precautions.

A VULNERABLE COLORADO DISTRICT INSPIRES DEMOCRATS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Touring a United Airlines training center Tuesday
during the congressional summer recess, Rep. Tom Tancredo, a
Republican freshman from the Denver suburb of Littleton, took
special delight in recounting a story of his return to Washington
on United last January, when he said several flight attendants
praised him for refusing to attend President Clinton's State of the
Union Message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be in the same room with the gentleman making
that speech,'' Tancredo, who is 53, told a group of employees,
recalling a presidential appearance that followed the House
impeachment vote and the start of the Senate trial. One flight
attendant, he said, even waived the charge for the movie headset.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tancredo earned widespread attention for his boycott,
it was fully in keeping with his conservative bearings and disdain
for Clinton that helped him win an open seat held for 16 years by
Don Schaefer, a less controversial Republican, who retired. Since
then, Tancredo has distinguished himself in other high-profile ways
that left no doubt about his conservative bent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it is precisely such dramatic acts that are fueling a
growing belief among many Democrats across the country that voters
are tiring of conservative Republicans as too far removed from the
political center and that by defeating just a few like Tancredo,
Democrats can retake control of the House next year.
</P>
<P>
   The gulf between Republicans and Democrats, reflected by
opposing views on such issues as gun control and tax cuts, is also
one reason officials of both parties say fund-raising efforts for a
House election still 15 months away are proceeding at a dazzling
pace in Tancredo' district and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which helps
raise money for Democratic House candidates, says that 17
challengers in districts where party leaders views the incumbent
Republican as vulnerable each passed $100,000 in fund raising by
June 30, including 6 who passed $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   By the same date, the National Republican Congressional
Committee said fund raising for the 2000 campaign had exceeded 1998
efforts by 66 percent, with 18 challengers and candidates for open
seats already above $100,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are huge amounts for this early in the cycle,'' said Don
Simon, executive vice president of Common Cause, a group that works
for government reform. ``But it's a leading indicator of the stakes
in play for control of the House. It used to be rare that a
candidate would spend $1 million in a House race. After the last
two cycles, it is becoming more common, and I think we're going to
see a lot more this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Republicans hold a margin of 222-211 in the
House, with one independent who generally votes with the Democrats.
The recent death of Rep. George E. Brown Jr., D-Calif., has left
one seat vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Rocky Mountain states, Colorado is largely
represented in high office by Republicans, including the governor,
Bill Owens; both senators, Ben Nighthorse Campbell and Wayne
Allard, and four of the six House members.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Toltz, 42, a Democratic businessman from Englewood who began
raising money to challenge Tancredo just four weeks after the 1998
election, is one of the challengers who enjoyed early fund-raising
success, with $104,675 by the June 30 reporting period, compared
with about $165,000 for Tancredo.
</P>
<P>
   Using Tancredo's brand of conservatism as a major fund-raising
tool, Toltz contended in a recent interview that the incumbent's
views no longer match district tastes, calling him `'a polarizing
force and a master at pulling people apart.''
</P>
<P>
   As examples, Toltz cited several of Tancredo's other
controversial acts. In addition to skipping the State of the Union,
Tancredo was the only freshman House member of either party to
refuse an invitation to visit the White House. Also, he joined 16
other House members, all but a few of them Republicans, in a
lawsuit against Clinton in May, charging that the involvement of
American troops in Kosovo without Congressional approval was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Five years before he won his House seat, as president of the
Independence Institute, a conservative research organization in
Golden, Colo., Tancredo advocated no government support of public
education, a position he said he no longer holds as a congressman.
</P>
<P>
   While Toltz argued that the district can ill afford a
representative that holds such unusual views, Tancredo said Tuesday
that he stood by everything else he did, calling each a principled
stand that reflects his activist nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I end up this experience,'' Tancredo said, ``I want to be
able to think to myself that it mattered. If a majority disagrees
with me, then I should be out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   One subject Toltz declined to criticize Tancredo on was gun
control. Even though the House failed to pass any meaningful
measures this year, Tancredo was the only member of the Colorado
delegation that voted for the failed House legislation that
included modest reform.
</P>
<P>
   For Tancredo, it was more than a symbolic vote: He lives six
blocks from Columbine High School where two students last spring
shot and killed 12 students and a teacher before turning their guns
on themselves.

 &HT;    Meeting of Senate, governors proposed for 'federalism'
discussions
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ All 50 governors and the 100 members of the U.S.
Senate are invited to convene in Washington in February for what
Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt called a ``landmark'' session to discuss
the evolving relationship between the federal government and the
states.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt, the new chairman of the National Governors'
Association, said Tuesday they will discuss what he called the
``new frontier of federalism,'' a world in which the boundaries
separating states and even countries have become blurred by
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Republican and Democratic U.S. Senate leaders have agreed to the
meeting, said Leavitt, who was named chairman as the governors
wrapped up their four-day summer meeting.
</P>
<P>
   For state governments to continue to play an important role in a
technology-driven global economy, they must devise new models of
governing that emphasize central coordination but local control,
Leavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, states should join forces to create a central spot
on the Internet where financial services companies could go to be
licensed to do business in each of the 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   If the states don't act to preserve their traditional role in
areas such as regulating businesses, the federal government will
step in and take over, he said. This would create an undesirable
``one size fits all'' approach, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue that needs to be addressed is the sales tax
revenue that states have been losing because mail-order and
Internet sales are not taxed, Leavitt and other governors meeting
here have said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be required to rethink the (state-federal)
partnership. . . . A partnership that is not devoid of healthy
tension,'' Leavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes this would be the first such meeting
involving all 50 governors and the 100 U.S. Senators. It will occur
during the winter meeting of the governors' group in Washington,
next Feb. 26, 29.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, governors will be encouraged to meet with the
U.S. House members from their states, Leavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting between the senators and governors is key because
both groups of officeholders represent entire states, said Leavitt,
48, a Republican serving his second term as Utah's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The ``healthy tension'' Leavitt mentioned has been apparent
here. Some of the uneasiness with Washington subsided after U.S.
Sen. Don Nickles, R-0kla., told the governors he would do all he
could to stop efforts to force states to return surplus welfare
dollars to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the dispute over the surplus welfare money, the governors
also have criticized what appears to be an effort by Congress to
reduce spending in areas critical to the states such as health and
human service programs. The proposed cuts are part of the effort by
Congress to meet spending limitations it imposed on itself under
the 1997 Balanced Budget Act.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark welfare reform act passed by Congress in 1996
signified the most visible change that has resulted from this shift
_ moving much of the control of welfare programs from the federal
government to the states. The February session between the
governors and the senators represents the newest effort to better
define a relationship that has been shifting power from Washington
to the states for nearly two decades, dating at least to 1981 when
President Ronald Reagan began the first of his two terms.

   Net income rose to $1.25 billion, or 28 cents a diluted share,
compared with $1.03 billion, or 23 cents a share, in the quarter a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding a charge of 3 cents a share for a legal settlement
with Valores Corp., a Mexican grocery wholesaler, the company made
31 cents a share. Analysts had expected the company to earn 28
cents a share, according to First Call Corp., which tracks company
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The results sent shares of Wal-Mart up $2.6875, to $42.875.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest retailer, based in Bentonville, Ark., has
been setting records all year as it races toward greater expansion.
Last week, Wal-Mart had the fourth-largest bond issue in U.S.
history, raising $5.75 billion to buy ASDA Group PLC, a British
grocery chain. The company also had robust sales in July, posting
growth of 9.6 percent in stores open at least a year compared with
figures in year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were impressed with the quarter's $5 billion increase
in sales, to $38.5 billion. ``The numbers were very strong and
broad based,'' said Jeff Feiner, a retail analyst with Lehman
Brothers, who has raised his estimates for earnings for the year to
$1.25 a share from $1.21.
</P>
<P>
   The company said both increased sales and cost cutting
contributed to the gains. Its cost of sales fell to 78.3 percent of
revenue from 78.8 percent in the quarter a year earlier. In
particular, the retailer held domestic inventory growth to 2
percent while sales rose 14 percent, said Les Copeland, a company
spokesman. Average consumer purchases rose as shoppers showed
strong interest in clothing, household goods and groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart offers a limited selection of groceries at some of its
regular discount stores and a full grocery selection at its giant
supercenters, which have performed particularly well. ``The food
increases measured in the double digits,'' Copeland said.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart will not break out figures for supercenter sales from
its total store revenues, but analysts estimate that those sales
this year will be nearly $58 billion, up from $150 million 10 years
ago. Wal Mart's total sales last year were $138 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company already has 622 supercenters and has said it plans
to open 150 new ones this year. Wal-Mart's success in that area has
possibly dire implications for competitors in the food and drug
categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty percent of the retail growth in the food channel is
going directly to Wal-Mart, which means that by January 2003 their
supercenter sales will be greater than their No. 1, 2 and 3
competitors, food and drug combined,'' said Burt Flickinger III,
who has been studying regional retail patterns for three decades
and is now managing director of Reach Marketing, a retail and
marketing consulting agency in Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Wal-Mart opens against a big regional leader _ like
Jitney-Jungle in Louisiana _ they lose 50 percent of volume
overnight and the competitor never recovers,'' Flickinger added.
</P>
<P>
   Despite robust sales growth recently, other retailers have seen
their shares decline because of fears that the Federal Reserve will
raise interest rates and that consumer spending may slow later this
year. Wal-Mart seems mostly immune to such concerns, however.
``Even if the consumer environment does slow down, we still think
Wal-Mart is extremely well positioned,'' Feiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Flickinger went one step further. ``A consumer downturn is the
best possible thing that can happen to Wal-Mart and the worst thing
that could happen to every major competitor,'' he said. He argues
that a slowdown would only highlight Wal-Mart's pricing advantages.
``Wal-Mart's prices are 20 to 30 percent lower than competitors on
the fastest-selling items in the store like laundry detergent and
toothpaste.'' &QL;

PARENTS LOOK FOR THEIR CHILDREN AFTER SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY AND PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Aviva Baraza was watching CNN Tuesday when she
heard the horrible news: a shooting rampage at the North Valley
Jewish Community Center _ the day-care center her 7-year-old son
attends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I panicked,'' the woman said as she stood anxiously behind
police lines with a crowd of parents waiting to be reunited with
their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came straight to the school and have been waiting to find
out what happened to my son. This is bad. I don't know why anyone
would do this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Baraza and dozens of other frantic parents sped to the center in
the Granada Hills community of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley to
learn the fate of their children, to find them and take them home.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers and fathers, some weeping, many in work clothes, ran
down Rinaldi Street straining to get as close as they could to the
center, which operates a day-care center, day camp and preschool
for 300 children.
</P>
<P>
   When they spotted parents they knew, they hugged and exchanged
information. Others yelled urgently into cell phones, relaying
whatever bits of news they had learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where he is,'' one mother yelled into a cell
phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is horrible. Why would somebody do this to these kids?''
asked Debbie Simon, as she searched for her 7-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   One little boy, tucked safely inside his father's arms, could
only say, ``There was a bad guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Once parents reached the police line around the facility, they
were directed next door to a church shared by Temple Beth Torah, a
command post where police and day-care workers had led children
after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Sareet Kleiner, 33, of Granada Hills nervously dodged knots of
people until she spotted her 2-year-old twins, Dan and Tamar, being
ushered into Temple Beth Torah along with several other children.
</P>
<P>
   Kleiner said her husband called her and told her the news. She
turned on the radio and raced toward the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to see my kids are OK,'' Kleiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Randi Tobin of Granada Hills scoured the growing crowd searching
for her 5-year-old son, Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God, I just don't know what to think. My husband called me
and told me and I rushed down here. My mom was killed in a car
crash 30 years ago on this day. Another relative died three weeks
ago. And today is my son's birthday. I don't need any more of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Goldberg, whose 5-year-old son was at the center at the
time of the shooting, was trembling so violently she could barely
use her cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old resident of the San Fernando Valley's West Hills
community said she had had concerns about security when she first
signed her children up at the center but quickly dismissed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think there was a high enough level of security,''
said Goldberg, who has an 8-year-old child who was on a field trip
during the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen plenty of violence take place, and I was afraid. I
can't believe this happened. Those poor kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Macales, whose two young sons attend the center, said he
is considering moving his family back to Israel, where he believes
it's safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just talked to my wife and mother about moving the family
back to Israel,'' said Macales, a public relations officer for the
University of California, Los Angeles, who lives in the Northridge
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel there's not much of a future for Jews in the United
States. It's not an issue of anti-Semitism, but there's a moral
eclipse in America which leads to moral unaccountability in this
country. I dream to move back.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Nissenbaum, who was picking up her 4{-year-old daughter,
couldn't make sense of the tragedy either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do so much to protect your child. I don't know how much
more we can do,'' said Nissenbaum, who lives north of Los Angeles
in Valencia, one of the country's safest cities. ``It's frightening
and random. And it's scary to think that you can't always keep your
kid safe.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Pianko, who was reunited with son and daughter, said no
place is safe any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been quite aware of violence at schools, and the only
thing I can think of is to go to some remote island and deal with
your own,'' said Pianko, a Northridge resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to do. This school violence is such a new
dimension to society that I don't know if anybody knows how to
react.''

MINOR MAJOR IS A MAJOR STEPPING STONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Davis Love III stood on the threshold of his first major
championship. Yet none of the questions being lofted at Winged Foot
Golf Club had anything to do with the 1997 PGA Championship, an
event Love would win four days later.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, inquiring minds sought insight on Love's thoughts about
his position as a fence straddler in the race to secure a spot on
the Ryder Cup team. Finally, Love had heard enough. He cut off a
questioner in mid-sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait a minute, guys,'' Love said. ``This is a major
championship. This is not the qualifying school for the Ryder
Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's both. But in odd-numbered years, the season's
least-celebrated major championship is best known as the official
cutoff date for accumulating Ryder Cup points in quest of a berth
on the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life at the PGA Championship, the Rodney Dangerfield of
golf's major championships.
</P>
<P>
   The most-anticipated news conference this week at Medinah (Ill.)
Country Club will not be with Sunday's winner. It will be Monday
morning, when U.S. Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw announces his two
at-large picks for the 1999 team that will compete Sept. 24-26 at
The Country Club in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, for a second, the Masters being viewed as a springboard
to the Diners Club Matches. Or golfers at the U.S. Open playing to
position themselves for a spot in the Skins Game. Both scenarios
are laughable. Those majors stand alone and command attention, even
with fans who don't know a sand wedge from a sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   But the PGA does not. Every year, it's No. 4 chronologically in
terms of golf's major championships and No. 4 in the hearts of golf
fans. Heck, it's even a clear No. 4 to the participants.
</P>
<P>
   Want proof? Check the 1999 player guide distributed by
Cornerstone Sports, a Dallas-based agency whose clients include
professional golfers Mark Brooks, Phil Mickelson, Corey Pavin, Paul
Stankowski, Bob Tway and Brian Watts.
</P>
<P>
   As part of each player profile, golfers are asked which
tournament they would most like to win. Of the 14 PGA Tour
participants who specified a favorite, seven picked the U.S. Open.
Five opted for the Masters. Two selected the British Open. No one
named the PGA. And two of the respondents (Brooks and Tway) are
past PGA champions.
</P>
<P>
   For longtime golf observers, the PGA's place in the sport's
pecking order is far from breaking news. Its location on the
professional sports calendar is less than ideal, sentenced to the
dog days of August and overshadowed by the upcoming football season
and the onset of pennant races in major-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the event has suffered an identity crisis since 1958, when
the playing format was switched from match play to stroke play to
appease television executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt the PGA should go back to match play. That's
its roots. That's what made it special,'' said Tom Watson, 49, who
lacks only a PGA title to complete a personal sweep of golf's four
major championships.
</P>
<P>
   For the 27th consecutive year, Watson will chase that elusive
triumph, this time at Medinah. During his career, Watson has seen
the PGA contested at some of the nation's most prestigious courses:
Pebble Beach Golf Links, Congressional Country Club, Oakland Hills
Country Club. He has seen it played in more humble surroundings,
like Tanglewood Golf Club in Clemmons, N.C., and Shoal Creek
Country Club in Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Some years, tournament organizers lay out a menacing test, with
heavy rough and narrow fairways. That is the game plan for Medinah,
where even par could be the winning score. Other years, the layout
includes little rough, wide fairways and minimal challenge. John
Daly capitalized on a forgiving layout at Crooked Stick Golf Club
in Carmel, Ind., in 1991, shooting 12 under par for 72 holes
without the benefit of a practice round.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Colin Montgomerie shot 17 under ... and lost to Steve
Elkington in a playoff at Riviera Country Club in Pacific
Palisades, Calif. In 1976, Dave Stockton failed to break par (1
over) yet won by a stroke over Raymond Floyd at Congressional
Country Club in Bethesda, Md. You won't find that kind of disparity
in winning scores at other majors. The PGA's prestige is hurt
because its layouts often are not challenging enough to weed out
lesser players.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the past 11 PGA winners made the event their first major
championship. The extended run of long shot winners will not help
pull the PGA out of its spot as No. 4 among golf's major
championships any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still a major. And, through its symbiotic relationship
with the Ryder Cup, it might be starting to gain some prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Because the PGA of America runs both events, organizers are
willing to tolerate the PGA's perception as a Ryder Cup qualifying
tournament. And, by linking the two events in its bidding process
for future sites, officials have gained entry into a class facility
such as Medinah, which also will play host to the 2011 Ryder Cup
and the 2006 PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Awtrey, chief executive officer of the PGA of America,
described the double-dipping as ``part of our long-term strategic
plan we've formulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, officials hope playing enough PGA Championships at
recognized Ryder Cup sites will lift their annual event to
something other than No. 4 in the pecking order for major
championships. For this week, however, another Ryder Cup qualifying
school is set to commence. nn

 &HT;    Duval squirms in fame's spotlight
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ While on their Irish golf trip before last
month's British Open, David Duval and Tiger Woods found themselves
hitting practice balls one day in a remote field, playing the
equivalent of a Michael Jordan-Larry Bird game of ``horse.''
</P>
<P>
   During the friendly competition, the conversation got around to
dealing with the fame that accompanies the position they hold in
their sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell him what I've gone through, the mistakes I've made,
but he still has to experience it for David Duval,'' Woods was
saying Tuesday at the 81st PGA Championship. ``I've found a way to
handle it best for Tiger Woods. . . . I think he needs to make his
own mistakes and learn from them.''
</P>
<P>
   It looks like it might take a few more sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months after Duval seemingly had evolved into an
engaging, energized personality, he has returned to viewing at
least some of the media as a nagging, never-take-a-break presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not comfortable with the fame,'' Duval, 27, conceded
Tuesday, two days before the start of the PGA Championship at
Medinah Country Club. ``I don't think that the golfing public or
the writers have a right to know everything about me. . . . If that
seems standoffish, well, I apologize. . . . There are some things
that I think are for me to know and for you not to. . . . Everybody
wants me to talk about what happened to my brother, what happened
to the divorce of my folks. . . . Well, I just don't really want
to. I've done some of that, but I just don't like to talk about
it.'' Duval added to the media attention through his comments in a
recent Golf Digest story, in which he advocated some form of
compensation for Ryder Cup players and suggested a possible boycott
over the issue in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Candid to a fault, Duval sometimes ignores the timing of his
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he has labored to get used to his quotes becoming
headlines, Duval said, ``Maybe so. There may be a bit of a
transition just in that more people are listening. I don't have to
think about, when I leave here or somewhere else, which untruth did
I tell or what did I sugarcoat. I say what I think and I answer
honestly. . . . As a player, you don't change because you went to
No. 1. I try to let people know that, but they don't seem to want
to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sizeable pressure already existed on the former Georgia Tech
player for his lack of a major championship, despite 11 PGA Tour
victories since the fall of 1997 and acquisition of the world's No.
1 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of concerning himself with whatever intangible might
push him to a major title, Duval is wrestling with his critics. At
the British Open, he got in the face of an American reporter. On
Tuesday, he ripped the British media for inaccuracies at
Carnoustie, then was seen discussing a beef with a Golf Channel
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Other players ripped Carnoustie, but their words weren't
inspected quite as much. ``They made up words and quotes,'' Duval
said, ``and people ran with it.''
</P>
<P>
   This week should be fun for Duval. He has returned to Medinah,
where he played a U.S. Open as a 19-year-old and managed to make
the cut. He is striking the ball crisply, certainly better than in
the Woods match, where he said, ``I didn't swing well.'' He has
ironed out an alignment problem with his putting.
</P>
<P>
   Duval contended in both the Masters and U.S. Open, finishing in
a tie for 6th and 7th, respectively, before the tie for 62nd at
Carnoustie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you could rate my performance much above
mediocre,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Duval can push himself toward more pleasing headlines with a low
number in Thursday's first round. Medinah, 7,401 yards and fairly
straightforward, is a course that should fit his game. Duval's best
PGA finish was a tie for 7th at Winged Foot in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my golf game is very good,'' Duval said. ``If I can
just put it all together, I would hope to be talking to you all, or
at least have a chance, on Sunday.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton brought together some of his most
adept money-raisers on Tuesday night and tried to make the case
that they should support Vice President Al Gore to take his place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record of this administration is his record,'' Clinton
told two dozen top fund-raisers in a small, mahogany-paneled room
at the Hay-Adams Hotel here before turning over the microphone to
Gore and melting back into the mostly male, dark-suited gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've built a foundation,'' Gore said of the Clinton
administration. ``Now it's time to reach for the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Tuesday night's events, which consisted of two
dinners with 25 people at each one, were not fund-raisers. The
well-heeled guests, who ranged from Harvey Weinstein, head of
Miramax, to Edgar Bronfman Jr., president of Seagrams Co. Ltd., did
not pay for their exclusive sit-down dinners.
</P>
<P>
   But they are noted for their ability to raise money and Tuesday
night's events were intended to woo them to the Gore camp. Some of
them have already helped raise substantial amounts for the vice
president and have committed to do more, and the clubby dinners
were viewed as added incentives to keep going.
</P>
<P>
   Among the attendees were Terry McAuliff, who has helped Clinton
raise record amounts of cash for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is trying to persuade McAuliff to become chairman of the
Democratic National Committee to oversee fund-raising for the 2000
elections. But friends say McAuliff already feels overcommitted,
since he has signed on to raise money for Hillary Rodham Clinton's
Senate campaign, Clinton's library, the Clintons' legal defense
fund and their millennium bash in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Other guests on Tuesday night included Dennis Archer Jr., a
businessman and son of the mayor of Detroit; Alan Solomont, former
treasurer of the Democratic National Committee; Alfonso Fanjul, one

THE WONDER OF IT: THE WEST JUST SO  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif.)  (af) 
 Richard B. Woodward is photography editor-at-large for DoubleTake
magazine.  
 By RICHARD B. WOODWARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Carleton Watkins would rank among the great
enigmas of late 19th-century American art even if his life weren't
so mysterious and sad. The pictures he made of scenic glories in
the West during the 1860s and '70s have been the sublime standard
for generations of landscape photographers. Ansel Adams, for one,
worked in his long shadow.
</P>
<P>
   A fine Watkins photograph is about as fine as a photograph gets.
There is nothing hit or miss about where he chose to aim his
camera. His so-called mammoth prints, developed from 18-by-22-inch
glass plates, often combine an eerie clarity with a bold massing of
shapes that verges on analytic geometry.
</P>
<P>
   As the rigor of his compositions is startling for the time, so
are his later studies of domesticated trees and fruits. A
romantic's sense of wonder was matched by a classicist's restraint.
Contrary to the practice of many painters in the West, then and
since, Watkins surveyed nature without trumpery. By printing the
facts he didn't need to elaborate myths.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition of his work at the San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art (through Sept. 7, then moving to the Metropolitan Museum of Art
on Oct. 12) offers pristine examples of Watkins the magnificent.
His prints of Yosemite Valley are front and center.
</P>
<P>
   The power of persuasion in these images was such that Congress
preserved the valley as a sanctuary in 1864; and for a while print
sales to the public gave Watkins a comfortable living.
</P>
<P>
   But the show's curator, Douglas R. Nickel, also highlights many
lesser-known pictures in order to ask questions about the puzzling
maturity of the work. Nothing in the Watkins biography _ what
little we know of it, anyway _ explains how a former carpenter and
bookstore clerk, born in 1829 in Oneonta, N.Y., came to possess
such expressive gifts. How did a bumpkin who spent his adult life
in the northern California backwater produce some of the most
forward-looking pictures of the 19th century?
</P>
<P>
   In looking for clues, Nickel examines the innovative ways of
seeing pioneered by the Victorians, specifically the invention of
stereography. An early form of 3-D that became a craze in the
1850s, it was, in Nickel's judgment, the most important and
pervasive visual technology the 19th century produced, excepting
photography itself.
</P>
<P>
   A series of booths at the end of the show lets viewers
experience _ with the aid of computer software coupled to wireless
goggles, both courtesy of StereoGraphics _ what the thrill was all
about. The show and catalog (which has been published by Abrams)
are rightfully subtitled ``The Art of Perception.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most field photographers of his time, Watkins also made
stereographs for the home market, some 6,500. Mass marketed as
cards that fit into a binocular hand viewer, they heightened the
drama of perception. A street scene could become a stage in a
stereograph, with sharp divisions between foregrounds and
backgrounds, and figures cut out from both like silhouettes.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins exploited the stereograph's displacing qualities with
glee. In a shot of San Francisco, the streetcars look like toys in
a child's pop-up book. In another, of a ferry and its passengers,
he has arranged the people in layers, like ducks in a shooting
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   An 1878 image of lily pads on water reflecting a grid of windows
in the background offers the viewer no clear way to resolve a
pictorial riddle. Both the subject and its reflection seem to exist
in the same plane. As a study in flattened perspective, it rivals a
Degas.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins was clearly involved with the theatrics of space. He put
together multipanel photographs of cities, or of mountaintops, that
look down and across from high cliffs. Not only do these cinematic
panoramas convey the appropriate awe at the width of the horizon;
they can also bring on a dose of vertigo.
</P>
<P>
   Even the mesmerizing detail in some of Watkins' enormous plates,
as Nickel says, force the viewer's eyes to spiral around the print
and study it, rather than take it in at a glance.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Watkins was also making careful documents of
his time. His pictures of the Columbia River in 1867 show how the
Northwest was really won _ not on any battlefield, but in mining
camps and lumber mills, where the day-to-day harvesting of minerals
and timber produced the raw materials for exportable wealth.
</P>
<P>
   However much he may have manipulated space with his triptychs
and wide-angle lenses, Watkins stayed grounded in the economic
reality of his employers, primarily mine owners and the railroads.
A respect for the material world can be found throughout his work.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All his life he photographed trees as if he knew they were
essential for both life and culture. It is possible to examine a
dozen Watkins prints and, except for the train tracks and rare
steam engine, find little or no metal parts. The houses in a
panorama of Portland, Ore., appear to be entirely built of wood,
with stumps of felled trees prominent in the foreground. Even the
dams at this time were hewed out of timber.
</P>
<P>
   People hardly figure in Watkins' work, except as puny yardsticks
for measuring the loftier stature of nature. The five men standing
shoulder-to-shoulder in front of Grizzly Giant, the wizened sequoia
in Yosemite's Mariposa Grove, are barely visible beside the massive
base of its trunk. Almost no one in his pictures exhibits traits of
personality other than endurance in the face of vaster forces.
</P>
<P>
   The less grandiose trees he photographed in the 1870s may be his
most intimate work. They are like character studies. The buckeye
tree in a California front yard shades a cabin like a floppy hat.
His 1878 view of a house in a larch grove is as plain and mournful
as a Willa Cather novel.
</P>
<P>
   Seven detached figures stand in the shadows. The subject of the
picture appears to be neither the people nor the trees, but the
uneasy struggle to establish a home. A photograph of a box of
peaches on its side from 1887-88 is shocking in its simplicity. In
arranging the fruits so that their cleavage is unmistakable,
Watkins even seems to be telling a harmless dirty joke.
</P>
<P>
   That Watkins produced this majestic and diverse body of work
with little or no formal esthetic training is still hard to fathom,
as is his rapid and tragic decline in popularity. The Yosemite
pictures made him famous and employable. He was praised by Emerson
and Oliver Wendell Holmes. By 1871 his studio in San Francisco was
the grandest in the West.
</P>
<P>
   But in the late 1870s his fortunes reversed like a train rolling
backward down a mountain, and he never really found the brake. He
was a wretched businessman. In 1874 he lost a studio he had opened
in Yosemite, as well as the copyright on his plates of the park, to
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   At 50 he married a woman 28 years younger, only to find that he
could barely support her. The market for stereographs dried up
through saturation. Watkins' meticulous skills were less and less
in demand. He suffered from arthritis and blindness.
</P>
<P>
   In 1895-96 he lived with his family in a boxcar _ they couldn't
afford a house _ until his childhood friend, the railroad baron
Collis Huntington, deeded him a ranch. As a final blow, the 1906
San Francisco earthquake and fire destroyed the glass-plate
negatives in Watkins' main studio and, in effect, wiped out a
life's work. In 1910 he was committed to the Napa Hospital for the
Insane, where, six years later, he died. He is buried on the
grounds in an unmarked grave.
</P>
<P>
   The strangest puzzle may be how late recognition for Watkins has
been in coming. Beaumont Newhall's standard history of photography
didn't include a Watkins photograph in its first four editions.
Finally, in 1982, Watkins made the grade.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last 25 years, thanks in part to the advocacy of
scholars like Peter Palmquist, has Watkins been considered the
finest American photographer of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   His contemporaries didn't regard him as anything special,
either. They never saw him as unusually modern in his picture
making but rather as an exceptional craftsman. That also seems to
be how Watkins saw himself.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few remarks we have from him is second-hand _ he left
no diary or articles, and gave no interviews _ from the
photographer John Hillers, who had brought him prints to review.
``I have little advice to offer,'' said Watkins. ``You are a clean
worker in which lies the great secret of photography.''
</P>
<P>
   Although scholars have found that there is a great more to it _
and to him _ than that, the bedrock of Watkins' remarkable
artistry, even after as excellent a show and catalog as this, can
still seem more submerged than exposed.

JENNIFER PATERSON, TV COOK FROM `FAT LADIES,' DIES AT 71  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Uganda, Britain)   By ENID NEMY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jennifer Paterson, the over-the-top co-star of the quirky
television cooking show ``Two Fat Ladies,'' died Tuesday at a
hospital in London, where she lived. She was 71.
</P>
<P>
   Lung cancer had been diagnosed last month after Ms. Paterson
fell ill while filming installments of the cooking series with her
partner, Clarissa Dickson Wright.
</P>
<P>
   The show, featuring the two unashamedly corpulent and
opinionated eccentrics, is a hit in Britain and the United States
and has been syndicated in other countries following its debut on
the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Paterson and Ms. Dickson Wright were unknown to each other
until they were brought together by a BBC producer in what was
described as a match made in ratings heaven. One fan who apparently
contributed to the ratings was Prince Charles, who sent a gift of
homemade organic tomato soup and vanilla ice cream to Ms. Paterson
after she disclosed her illness last month.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Paterson and Ms. Dickson Wright offered their viewers
cholesterol-soaked dishes that they favored in their own homes. One
show, called ``Meat,'' featured meatloaf draped with strips of
bacon, lamb stew, fillet of beef and, perhaps as a nod to health
fanatics, a pan-fried chicken dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blame Americans for this fear of red meat and fat that's
spread all over England,'' Ms. Paterson told an interviewer last
year while taking a sip of vodka in a restaurant before heading to
the sidewalk for a pre-lunch cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dickson Wright agreed, although she credited the success of
the show to a backlash against what she called the health police.
``Our show seems to say to Americans that it's OK to eat red meat
and cook with butter,'' she said in the same article. ``I don't
know why they feel they need permission.''
</P>
<P>
   Each episode of ``The Two Fat Ladies'' was recorded at a
different location. Every show began with Ms. Paterson astride a
motorcycle with her partner squeezed into a sidecar, zooming toward
their destination. When they did their ``Meat'' show, for example,
they cooked for a girls' lacrosse team in the kitchen of a boarding
school.
</P>
<P>
   They each cooked two dishes per show, working in tandem and
punctuating their culinary advice with a raucous sense of humor on
any subject that took their fancy. They delighted in skewering the
pretensions of haute cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ms. Paterson said she was in fine shape for her age.
``Lots of meat, drink and cigarettes and not giving in to things,''
she said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   She was born into an army family and was unconventional even as
a child. At 15, she was expelled from convent school for being
disruptive; she later became a matron at a girls' boarding school
near Reading.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Paterson went on from there to become a professional chef.
She was the cook for the Ugandan legation in London and later
provided weekly lunches for celebrities, including Prince Charles.
She was a food columnist for The Spectator when she met Ms. Dickson
Wright, a former barrister who wrote a column for Decanter magazine
and owned a cookbook store in Edinburgh, where she lives.
</P>
<P>
   The pair was characterized by Suzanne Hamlin in a 1998 article
in The New York Times as being ``as appealing as someone else's
dotty aunts.'' But Ms. Hamlin, in reviewing their cookbook
``Cooking With the Two Fat Ladies'' (Clarkson Potter), reported
that all six of six recipes she tested did not work as described
and that eccentricities and farce failed to be compelling in a
cookbook that purported to be useful.
</P>
<P>
   Following its instructions, she said, one dish ended up looking
as though ``it had barely survived a brush fire'' and a pudding
that was touted as thick and creamy turned out ``wan and thin as a
sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is their rapid rise here, of course, that makes this
careless effort at a cookbook so regrettable,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Food Network began broadcasting the shows in the United
States in 1997 and, as Ms. Hamlin noted, ``in the blink of an eye,
they developed a cult following among those who have an innate
fondness for British eccentrics.'' American Public Television also
distributes ``Two Fat Women'' to stations all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Food Network is planning a two-hour tribute to Ms. Paterson,
who is survived by an uncle and two brothers, on Sunday night at 9.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dickson Wright told the BBC that she had last seen Ms.
Paterson 10 days ago, although they had spoken each day on the
telephone. She had intended to visit her Wednesday to drop off a
tin of caviar, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't see the point of flowers,'' Ms. Dickson Wright
said. ``She'd rather have caviar.''

WHEN THE SPICE OF CHOICE WAS SIN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 J. Hoberman is senior film critic for The Village Voice.  
 By J. HOBERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I wish to join the Legion of Decency, which condemns vile and
unwholesome moving pictures. I unite with all who protest against
them as a grave menace to youth, to home life, to country and to
religion.'' So began a pledge written in the spring of 1934 by the
Archbishop of Cincinnati, John T. McNicholas.
</P>
<P>
   Distributed in Roman Catholic churches across America, the
petition garnered some four million signatures within a month.
</P>
<P>
   Racy and insolent, populated by dynamic, street-smart criminals
and glamorous ``fallen women'' in scanty lingerie, set in Art Deco
penthouses and skid row dives, predicated on breezy wisecracks and
slangy double-entendres that confounded censors and offended less
cosmopolitan audiences, the Hollywood movies of the early 1930s
were a different world. Or were they?
</P>
<P>
   ``I condemn absolutely those salacious motion pictures which,
with other degrading agencies, are corrupting public morals and
promoting sex mania in our land,'' the Legion of Decency pledge
continued.
</P>
<P>
   Adopted four years before the legion began its crusade, the
Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America Production
Code had proscribed undue exposure, indecent dancing, lustful
kissing, obscenity and explicit adultery, seduction or rape, not to
mention ``sex perversion,'' ``white slavery'' and
``miscegenation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Code was not truly in force, having gone into effect
just as the movie industry was stunned by two surprise
developments, one technological, the other economic. Movies became
``talkies'' even as hard times battered a business previously
imagined depression-proof.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the stock market crash, Warner Brothers and Fox
were suffering heavy losses. Universal had discharged hundreds of
its employees. RKO was already in receivership. Paramount, which
would declare bankruptcy the following year, was selling off its
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Weekly movie attendance was 60 percent of what it had been
before the Depression began. By the summer of 1932, a third of
American moviehouses had gone dark, and exhibitors were
experimenting with exploitation angles ranging from double bills to
dish giveaways to bingo games. Producers were desperate and, as
demonstrated by ``The Joy of Pre-Code: Sex, Booze and Red Hot Jazz,
1930-33,'' a 44-film series starting on Friday at Film Forum 2,
they pushed the weakly enforced Code to its limits and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone brought up on the movies of the 1940s and 1950s,
those of the early '30s can be a revelation. Sinners escape
punishment and virtue is not necessarily rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Crime sometimes pays and marriage vows are frequently flouted.
Self-interest is a near-universal principle. Fast-talking,
tough-acting James Cagney became Warner Brothers' top star by
hustling his way up from the streets, but he was scarcely the only
tiger in the urban jungle. The now-forgotten Warren William,
oiliest of alpha males and caddish personification of ruthless
capitalism, abused the men and seduced the women lucky enough to be
working but unfortunate enough to be working for him.
</P>
<P>
   Women acted out as well. If the former factory worker Joan
Crawford was kept by the Park Avenue lawyer Clark Gable in MGM's
enormously successful ``Possessed'' (1931), the more proactive Jean
Harlow wrecked her boss' home, then married and betrayed him in the
1932 comedy ``Red-Headed Woman.'' In ``Female'' (1933), Warner
Brothers' biggest female star, Ruth Chatterton, ran an automobile
plant and satisfied her sex drive with a succession of handsome
young employees.
</P>
<P>
   Marlene Dietrich sold her body to support her sick husband in
``Blonde Venus'' (1932). That movie lost money for Paramount, but
the studio struck gold with Mae West _ even if Will Hays, the
mostly ineffectual head of the producers' and directors' Code, did
manage to keep them from titling her second vehicle ``It Ain't No
Sin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby Face'' (1933), which opens the series on a bill with the
luridly expressionist Edward G. Robinson vehicle ``Two Seconds''
(1932), is a crude, still-powerful morality play in which Barbara
Stanwyck systematically sleeps her way to the pinnacle of economic
power. Dreamed up by the Warner production boss Darryl Zanuck in
the wake of MGM's ``Red-Headed Woman,'' the movie single-mindedly
tracks Stanwyck's climb from a gritty Pennsylvania steel town,
where she is pimped by her father in his speakeasy, to control of a
New York bank.
</P>
<P>
   Each new conquest celebrated by a honkytonk chorus from ``St.
Louis Blues,'' Stanwyck is a femme fatal as inexorable as the
Depression itself: her discarded men lose their jobs, their
fortunes and, in two cases, their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Goldstein, the director of repertory programming at Film
Forum 2, calls ``Baby Face'' the quintessential pre-Code movie,
although he singles out the moment in the 1932 ``Call Her Savage''
when an amorous Great Dane jumps Clara Bow as ``the most
astonishing pre-Code shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein organized his first pre-Code series 11 years ago. ``I
don't think anyone had ever done one before,'' he says. ``The
period was completely overlooked. They never showed these films on
television when I was growing up. Not one of them is a `classic'
and that's why it was a discovery for most people.'' Film Forum's
``Hollywood Before the Code'' not only clicked at the box office
but also received national publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Within the year, Goldstein said, revival houses in Boston,
Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco ran similar programs, while
MGM Home Video issued a collection of pre-Code movies. The
forthcoming series is Film Forum's fourth, and interest in the
period continues to grow. Two books are scheduled for publication
this fall, Thomas Doherty's scholarly history, ``Pre-Code
Hollywood: Sex, Immorality and Insurrection in American Cinema,
1930-34'' (Columbia University), and Mark A. Vieira's lavish
coffee-table volume, ``Sin in Soft Focus'' (Abrams).
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the pre-Code movies were attacked for their amoral
violence. The 1931-32 gangster cycle drew most of the heat _ even
Al Capone professed to disapprove, telling reporters that movies
like ``Public Enemy'' and ``Little Caesar'' were ``doing nothing
but harm to the younger element of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1932, the studios were cranking out ``bad girl'' movies.
Variety, which attributed their popularity to the female audience,
would estimate that 80 percent of the 440 pictures released during
the 1932-33 season had some sort of ``sex slant.'' Nevertheless,
some movies were more scarlet than others, and ``Red-Headed Woman''
in particular sent studios stampeding down the primrose path.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An Irving Thalberg project, written by Anita Loos to relaunch
Harlow at her new studio, ``Red-Headed Woman'' was as much
throwback as innovation. The irresistible vamp who haunted the
American screen 15 years earlier in the exotic form of Theda Bara
was resurrected as a gum-chewing stenographer.
</P>
<P>
   Sound brought silent movies down to earth, and Harlow embodied
the triumph of the vulgar, seducing her married prey on his living
room sofa with his photograph pinned to her garter. As comic as she
is steamy, Harlow's two-timing golddigger maintains audience
sympathy even when she petulantly shoots her estranged husband. Nor
does the movie see fit to punish her. The bad girl winds up in
Paris, mistress to a marquis, with a handsome chauffeur in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red-Headed Woman'' inspired Warner Brothers to make ``Baby
Face'' and Fox to adapt Tiffany Thayer's risque ``Call Her Savage''
as the comeback vehicle for the erstwhile ``It Girl,'' Clara Bow,
after sound and scandal short-circuited her career. (Plodding as
cinema and racist in its implications, this sordid saga of a half
American Indian vixen is best known today for its often
anthologized scene of two men dressed as French maids entertaining
the patrons of a Greenwich Village speakeasy.)
</P>
<P>
   Paramount adapted William Faulkner's sensational ``Sanctuary''
in 1933 for the ``The Story of Temple Drake'' (thrill-seeking
Southern belle slips into degradation after she is raped by a
gangster and dumped in a New Orleans brothel), while embarking on a
protracted struggle to bring Broadway's bawdy sensation, Mae West,
to Hollywood. Hays managed to delay West's screen debut but failed
to prevent it. Released in early 1933, ``She Done Him Wrong''
grossed $2 million in less than two months, returning 10 times its
production costs in North America alone.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, pre-Code advertising promised more sex than the
movies themselves delivered. (For ``Baby Face'' _ ``She Had IT and
Made IT Pay.'') The strategy ultimately backfired. It was a movie
billboard that so offended Denis Cardinal Dougherty of Philadelphia
that he called for a boycott of all movies. The first selective
boycotts had been organized by the Detroit diocese during the
summer of 1933.
</P>
<P>
   With the Legion of Decency pledge promoted from the pulpit and
Mae West pilloried in the Hearst press, the crusade gathered
momentum over the next 10 months. ``Hollywood is in the most
serious crisis of its history,'' The Los Angeles Times reported in
June 1934. With the creation of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's
National Recovery Administration, which sought to regulate film
exhibition practices, the studios were worried that the federal
government might then try to police movie content as well.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Bank of America's chairman, A.H. Giannini, threatened
to link continued financing to Production Code Administration
approval, the industry buckled.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, Hays had appointed the hard-nosed and
well-connected Catholic journalist Joseph Breen to enforce the
Code. (As Doherty points out, pre-Code is a misnomer; the correct
term should be pre-Breen.) From then on, as the screenwriter Herman
Mankiewicz paraphrased the Code for his peers, the hero and heroine
have to be virgins, while the villain can have sex with anybody he
wants, ``cheating and stealing, getting rich and whipping the
servants.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``But you have to shoot him in the end.'' By 1935,
Hollywood had passed from inspired disorder into the golden age of
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Code improve American movies as well as morals? Doherty
concludes his detailed and fascinating study by stating the
``inconvenient truth'' that Hollywood's ``most vivid and compelling
motion pictures'' were produced ``under the most severe and
narrow-minded censorship.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet the early, free-wheeling '30s churned up a remarkable
number of enduring celluloid archetypes, ranging from gangsters and
gold diggers through Dracula and King Kong, to such pop icons as
W.C. Fields, Mae West, the Marx Brothers, Betty Boop and even
Mickey Mouse. Moreover, individual filmmakers as distinguished as
Ernst Lubitsch, Josef von Sternberg and Busby Berkeley produced
their finest work during the pre-Code period.
</P>
<P>
   There is something to be said for crisis as a stimulus to
popular art. Similarly, the transformation of movies to talkies
served to break existing rules for narrative filmmaking, even as
the Depression pushed producers towards wild experimentation. Taken
as a whole, the movies of the early '30s constitute a distinctive
American idiom.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest pre-Code movies are as rowdy, pungent and oddball
as the Sunday funnies or the country blues. Tawdry gems like the
electric-chair flashback ``Two Seconds,'' the declasse daisy-chain
``Blood Money'' _ a madam loves a bail bondsman who loves a
masochistic debutante who loves a bank robber _ or the tropical,
``No Exit''-like nightmare ``Safe in Hell'' are hard-boiled beyond
belief and almost kabuki in their economy of means.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to their Depression-induced frugality and the exigencies
of the double feature, pre-Code movies are admirably terse. Perhaps
even more wondrous than their convoluted, down-and-dirty narratives
is the seemingly lost art of squeezing such shenanigans into a
highly satisfying 70 minutes.

LAZIO SUSPENDS SENATE CAMPAIGN; LEAVES FIELD CLEAR FOR GIULIANI 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bowing to an emerging consensus among state
Republican Party leaders, Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island has
decided to suspend his primary campaign for the U.S. Senate,
clearing the way for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to become the party's
uncontested choice for 2000, party officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who has scheduled a news conference Wednesday to announce
his plans, reached his decision reluctantly and after a secluded
weekend of consultation with supporters and advisers, an aide to
Lazio said. He decided to suspend his campaign only after Gov.
George Pataki _ who had been tacitly nudging him to challenge
Giuliani _ announced on Friday that he thought Giuliani was the
best candidate the Republicans had to send up against Hillary
Rodham Clinton, and urged Lazio to defer an announcement tour he
had scheduled for next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio and his aides did not return telephone calls seeking
comment Tuesday. His press secretary, Mollie Conkey, said Lazio
would detail his decision at a news conference on Long Island
today. She declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, neither Giuliani nor Mrs. Clinton, who was
campaigning in New York again Tuesday, meeting with political
leaders in Queens and the Bronx and holding a forum with union
members in Queens, has formally announced a Senate candidacy. But
with each passing day, both have given increasingly stronger
indications that they are in the race to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's reported agreement to back off would produce a highly
unusual scenario for New York politics: a contest for an open seat
in the U.S. Senate between two candidates who have been spared the
rigors and expense of a party primary. That dynamic, assuming it
holds up, means that Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton will be able to
focus without distraction on a general election campaign that seems
likely be a constant presence in New York between now and November
2000.
</P>
<P>
   A primary between Lazio and Giuliani would have been a
particular problem for the mayor, because it probably would have
forced him to stress some of his more conservative positions in an
effort to counter Lazio with a Republican primary electorate. That
would have inevitably complicated a general election campaign
against Mrs. Clinton, assuming he won the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Lazio's advisers described him as unhappy with Pataki
and startled by the governor's announcement on Friday. They said
that he had given serious consideration over the weekend to
following the advice of some associates, notably Michael Long, the
state Conservative Party leader, and staying in the race.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, Lazio reportedly concluded that it would be
impossible to stage a realistic run with explicit opposition from
Pataki and Alfonse D'Amato, the former senator and Pataki's
political ally.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Pataki and D'Amato to support Giuliani, no
matter how reluctantly, would have complicated Lazio's candidacy
every step of the way: from raising money to finding party leaders
to host political events. Most important, it would have made it
nearly impossible to win enough organized support from the state
party, 25 percent of the votes at the party convention, to
guarantee him a spot on a primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how he had any choice,'' said an associate to
Pataki, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In deferring his plans rather than dropping out entirely, Lazio
was following the script suggested by Pataki. That would allow
Lazio to enter the race if Giuliani ended up deciding to skip it,
an unlikely though not impossible occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   In making that suggestion, Pataki called on Giuliani to firm up
his political plans quickly to allow the party to prepare for the
contest to replace Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democrat who is
retiring. At City Hall, Giuliani, asked about Lazio's decision,
seemed in no hurry to rush his own schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have got my own decisions to make, campaign to put together,
money to raise, political support to gather,'' Giuliani said, ``and
you know I am not going to pay attention to anybody else's campaign
until sometime a year from now when this election really gets
started. Everybody has escalated this election way too fast. People
are going to be really bored with it in about three months if we
don't slow it down a little.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, appearing at another ``listening forum,'' this one
with union members in Queens, also declined to comment on
developments among her prospective opponents. ``I try not to think
about issues that I have no control over,'' she said. ``And you
know what the other party decides to do is strictly their
business.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the evolution of a contest in which both major party
candidates for statewide office might win their party's support
without a nomination battle _ an almost unprecedented event in
modern New York politics _ is the latest sign of just how
profoundly the prospective candidacy of a first lady has changed
the dynamics of the race.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Democrats, other prospective candidates
cleared the field as soon as Mrs. Clinton said she was interested.
In the case of Republicans, party leaders across the nation had
been urging the state party to back Giuliani as the strongest
candidate the party could offer to assure the removal of the
Clintons from public life after President Clinton leaves the White
House in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, Lazio's prospective exit from the race was good,
if less than surprising, news for Giuliani. Given the importance
the national party had attached to the race, most Republicans had
assumed that Pataki would eventually advise Lazio to pull out and
allow Giuliani to proceed unencumbered.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are political complications ahead for Giuliani
involving the state's Conservative Party, which typically
cross-endorses Republican candidates for statewide office. Long,
the Conservative Party leader, said that Giuliani called him on
Saturday morning and asked for a meeting to discuss the possibility
of winning a spot on the Conservative Party line.
</P>
<P>
   Long has left little question both about his inclination to
support Lazio and his suspicions about Giuliani's ideological
credentials. He said Tuesday that he could not imagine the
Conservative Party supporting Giuliani unless the mayor made two
major concessions: abandoning his connection to the Liberal Party,
which endorsed him in his race for mayor, and dropping his
opposition to measures to ban a form of late-term abortion, which
opponents describe as partial-birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look to run a candidate on our line,'' Long said. ``We
weren't formed just to pick winners. I don't need to send someone
to Washington who winds up voting against cutting taxes, or not to
shrink the size of government, or sending someone to Washington who
doesn't want to vote to stop partial-birth abortions.''

TAX COURT SAYS UPS INFLATED DEDUCTIONS AND MUST BE PENALIZED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)   (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A judge has ruled that United Parcel Service took inflated tax
deductions in 1984 and must pay taxes, penalties and interest that
the company said may total nearly $300 million for that year.
</P>
<P>
   But its ultimate tax liability could be much larger _ perhaps
growing into one of the biggest corporate tax cases ever _ because
the Tax Court decision, issued Monday, covers only the first year
of a business practice that has continued ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The 114-page decision, and its withering dissection of testimony
by UPS executives, was a rare victory for the IRS in its efforts to
prevent companies from taking tax deductions when they move money
to subsidiaries overseas for the sole purpose of avoiding taxes.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, United Parcel Service would not estimate its
potential liability. But previously, the company disclosed that for
the years 1985 through 1990, it could owe $259 million in taxes
alone.
</P>
<P>
   UPS has continued to claim deductions since 1990 on the same
theory that the Tax Court denied, said Kenneth Sternad, the chief
spokesman for the Atlanta-based company. Projecting these figures
to the present, the total in taxes, interest and penalties could
easily surpass a billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the IRS has challenged the company's tax returns each
year through 1990, and UPS _ though it will appeal Monday's
decision to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta _
expects the agency to contest its tax payments for the subsequent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will not affect plans, announced by the company in
July, to sell shares to the public for the first time, Sternad
said.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the civil tax case were deductions that UPS took for
the costs of insuring against damaged or lost parcels worth more
than $100.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS claimed that UPS charged customers three times the
actual cost of the insurance in a scheme to funnel money to an
insurance company it created in 1984 in Bermuda, thereby inflating
its tax deductions. UPS charged customers 25 cents per $100 for
``extra value coverage'' in 1984. It then paid the money over to
National Union Fire Insurance of Pittsburgh and took a deduction
for the expense.
</P>
<P>
   But the transaction was a sham, wrote Judge Robert Ruwe in his
ruling. National Union was merely acting as a front, he said,
because after taking a small fee, it sent the money on to Overseas
Partners Ltd., a Bermuda insurance company owned and controlled by
UPS.
</P>
<P>
   United Parcel argued that its insurance fees were reasonable,
but the judge held that the rates were as much as three times what
UPS would have paid had it bought the insurance in the open market,
instead of through its own insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas Partners counted at least 63 cents of each dollar it
received as profit, Ruwe wrote _ in some years as much as 78 cents
on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   In funneling business to the Bermuda insurer, the judge ruled,
UPS was motivated only to reduce its income taxes in the United
States, and not by any legitimate business purpose. It is legal to
organize business activities in ways that reduce taxes _ but it is
illegal to engage in transactions whose sole purpose is to avoid
taxes, Ruwe noted.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted at length the testimony of Neil Doherty, an expert
witness hired by the company for the Tax Court proceedings. At
trial, an IRS lawyer asked Doherty if the 25-cent-per-$100 fee
would have made sense for UPS if the money were not being paid to
an insurer it controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a rather strange business decision to basically
give off that profit to an outsider,'' testified Doherty, a
professor of insurance and risk management at the Wharton School of
the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The inflated insurance charges allowed UPS to take nearly $65
million in improper deductions, the judge held, while inflating the
profits of Overseas Partners, which is not required to pay United
States income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The judge upheld the IRS's finding that the company owed $64.9
million in tax, a $3.2 million penalty for negligence, an
additional $11.3 million penalty for substantial underpayment of a
tax liability and interest at 50 percent above the usual rates on
$45 million of the underpayment.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to 1984, the judge wrote, UPS collected fees to cover
damage or loss to packages worth more than $100 and treated that
money as part of its regular revenue stream, paying taxes on its
profits.
</P>
<P>
   The company argued that it had created the Bermuda insurance
company not to avoid taxes, but to avoid running afoul of state
insurance regulators, some of which had questioned car rental
companies about charges they added to customer bills to cover
potential damage to vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Johnson, at the time the company's chief insurance
official, acknowledged in his testimony in the case that no state
insurance official had challenged UPS and that he had never asked
any state or federal official if the company was acting improperly
in charging the fees.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also noted that UPS had letters from each state
authorizing its earlier practice of adding charges for high-value
packages.
</P>
<P>
   As a major company, Ruwe wrote, he would have expected UPS to
investigate any such risks and to produce documents showing its
legal and economic analysis of the issue. But during the period it
was considering setting up the Bermuda insurer, he added, UPS
``produced no documentation, such as corporate minutes'' indicating
that it ``had motives other than tax reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   Sternad, the company spokesman, said UPS believed the judge was
wrong and that its insurance charges were reasonable. He said the
company was not considering making refunds to customers. The IRS
has fought an uphill battle against a range of practices by
corporations intended to reduce their income taxes in the United
States by taking profits in countries that charge little or no
corporate income tax, such as Bermuda, Luxembourg and the Cayman
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   There are many legitimate reasons for companies to move funds
overseas, tax experts note, so the IRS must prove the sole motive
for the transaction was tax avoidance.
</P>
<P>
   In insurance arrangements like that set up by UPS, it has been
nearly impossible for the IRS ``to draw a bright line around which
payments to captive insurance companies are proper and which are
not,'' said Andrew Pike, a former Treasury official who teaches tax
law at American University in Washington.

ADVERTISING: SIGNS OF STRAIN BETWEEN AGENCIES AND CLIENTS
CONTINUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Relations between agencies and advertisers are
showing signs of strain for a second consecutive year, according to
an annual survey.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the survey, which asked executives at agencies
and client companies to assess the nature of their dealings with
each other, indicate that efforts to narrow the gap between them
have fallen short, as they did last year. The two years of
deterioration follow surveys in 1996 and 1997 that had indicated
improvement in relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an industry, we're not doing great,'' said Nancy L. Salz,
president of Nancy L. Salz Consulting in New York, who offered a
preview of the findings of the 1999 Salz Survey of
Advertiser-Agency Relations. ``Our numbers are absolutely
confirming what the AAF found.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salz's reference was to a much-publicized survey released in
June by the American Advertising Federation. That study showed
surprising skepticism among top corporate executives about the
effectiveness of advertising in helping their companies grow as
well as a reluctance to declare themselves more than merely
satisfied with advertising on behalf of their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers who responded to the Salz Consulting survey also
judged advertising to be less important to their sales growth than
before.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when asked how much sales could improve if their
agencies were always able to do the best possible work, the mean
figure the respondents gave was 21.4 percent. That was the lowest
since a mean of 21.1 percent in the recession year of 1991 and a
sharp decline from 31.4 percent as recently as 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And when asked to rate the quality of work from their agencies
on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 highest, the mean rating from
advertisers for 1999 was 7.0. That was the lowest since the same
rating in 1992 and 1993 and a significant decrease from 7.5 as
recently as 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about accountability,'' Ms. Salz said.
``Advertising as a tool has got to be accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't `Show me the money,''' she added. ``It's `Show me the
results.'''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, this year's answers to the survey, which has
been conducted for the last 14 years, point to a results-oriented
way to dissipate tensions between Madison Avenue and clients: the
practice known as performance-based compensation. That's when
clients switch from traditional methods of paying their agencies,
like a 15 percent commission or a flat fee, to basing payments on
predetermined, measurable goals like increases in sales of
products. Among the well-known marketers using or experimenting
with performance-based compensation is the Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Performance-based compensation has an effect for the good,''
Ms. Salz said, reviewing survey tables showing that advertisers
using it reported smoother relationships with their agencies than
those that did not: more teamwork, more respect, more focus on the
work.
</P>
<P>
   Performance-based compensation is no cure-all, Ms. Salz
acknowledged; otherwise ``you'd see more people using it'' than the
39 percent of advertisers who reported they did. Agency executives
who responded said that 22.9 percent of their clients were
compensating them based on performance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Salz said, performance-based compensation ``offers a
foundation for better advertising,'' primarily because it
encourages agencies and clients to collaborate more, by ``focusing
on common goals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's putting agencies in the same boat as clients,'' she
added. ``They are rowing or not rowing together.''
</P>
<P>
   For agencies, the survey indicated a potential bump in the road
to more performance-based compensation: clients using it said they
were likely to go beyond their agency rosters in assigning tasks in
realms like strategy and marketing. Of course, the struggle to keep
clients from seeking advice elsewhere has been one of the most
pressing recent concerns among agency leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The three reasons most often cited by advertisers for delegating
tasks were expertise, wanting a new perspective and cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``With more on the line under performance-based compensation,''
Ms. Salz said, ``advertisers are paying a lot more attention to how
they're spending their money.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted in March and May for Salz Consulting by
Thurm Marketing and Consulting Inc. in Princeton, N.J. Salz
Consulting sponsors training seminars in agency relations and
advertising development for marketers like Clorox, GTE and
Hewlett-Packard.

JAZZ EXECUTIVE WILL BE KNICKS' NEW GENERAL MANAGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saying it was time to grow up and blaze his own
trail, Scott Layden, the longtime executive of the Utah Jazz,
announced Tuesday that he will become the next general manager of
the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks will officially announce the hiring at a news
conference Wednesday at Madison Square Garden. Dave Checketts,
Madison Square Garden president, was not available for comment
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Layden, who made his announcement at a news conference at the
Delta Center, worked for the Jazz for the past 18 years. He joined
the franchise as an assistant coach in 1981 while his father,
Frank, now the president of the Jazz, was the team's head coach. He
has been Utah's vice president of basketball operations since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   To come to New York, Layden, 42, will receive a multiyear
contract believed to be worth more than $1.5 million annually from
the Knicks. He was paid less than $400,000 last season by the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes as a really tough decision to move on, but it just
feels like the right thing to do,'' said Layden, who has also
served as Utah's head scout and director of player personnel. ``I
need to move on and grow up a little bit. I've really felt like
I've been on the coat tails of some brilliant people _ coaches,
players, owners and the people who work in this organization.''
While Layden has no family ties to the Knicks, he does have more
than a working relationship with Checketts, who was a member of
Utah's front office from 1983 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping build the Jazz into a Western Conference
contender, Checketts and Layden became close friends. Though
Layden's credentials are impressive, his strong relationship with
Checketts is believed to have been a major factor in his hiring.
Despite giving Jeff Van Gundy a two-year, $10 million contract
extension last month, tension still exists between Checketts and
the Knicks' head coach because of Checketts' awkward courtship of
Phil Jackson near the end of last season, according to people
within the Knicks organization. Realizing that he and Van Gundy
could butt heads in the future, Checketts wanted to bring an ally
into the organization, which is why he is willing to give Layden a
contract worth nearly twice as much as that of his predecessor,
Ernie Grunfeld, who made $800,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy, who is scheduled to return Wednesday from a vacation
in California, could not be reached for comment, but his agent, Rob
Ades, said his client would not be paranoid about the hiring of
Layden. ``I am happy for Frank Layden that his son got the job
because Frank is my friend and I've known him for 35 years,'' Ades
said. ``I am sorry that Ed Tapscott did not get the job because he
is my friend and I've known him for 20 years. I've never met Scott,
but if he's anything like his father, he's a great guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tapscott, the Knicks' vice president of player personnel for the
past two seasons, had been serving as the club's interim general
manager since Grunfeld was unceremoniously removed from that post
on April 21.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The prevailing assumption for months was that Tapscott, who has
more than enough qualifications to fill the position, would receive
the job. Tapscott has been with the Knicks since 1991 and refused
to comment when reached Tuesday by telephone. Had Tapscott been
promoted, he would have become only the fifth African-American
general manager in the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed as an outstanding judge of talent, Layden has been the
key decision-maker concerning Utah's player personnel moves since
1992. While the future Hall of Famers, Karl Malone and John
Stockton, were already playing for the Jazz, Layden put together
the complementary cast that helped Utah reach the NBA Finals in
1997 and 1998. In 1994, he orchestrated a trade that brought the
shooting guard, Jeff Hornacek, to the Jazz, and a year later, he
discovered the now reputable backup point guard, Howard Eisley, in
the Continental Basketball Association. Some of Layden's finest
work was accomplished in the draft, where plucked two gems late in
the second round. In 1993, he used the 45th pick to select Bryon
Russell, who has developed into a solid small forward, and three
years later, he acquired the versatile Shandon Anderson with the
54th pick. ``He has picked some outstanding players in the second
round,'' said Wally Walker, the Seattle Sonics general manager.
``That's a team that has been good for a long time, and he's done a
great job despite always having a low position in the draft.''
Though New York will provide a much different atmosphere than Salt
Lake City, Layden will not be totally out of his element. His
father grew up in Brooklyn, and Scott developed into a top-notch
high school athlete in upstate New York. After playing collegiate
basketball at St. Francis of Pennsylvania, he landed his first
coaching job at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey. At
Tuesday's farewell conference in Utah, Layden added that one of his
main reasons for making the move was that his wife, Marsha, and
four daughters are excited about tackling New York City. ``He said
his family really liked New York,'' said Evan Silverman, a Jazz
spokesman. ``And that they thought it was time to move on, time to
make a change.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly all the operators of commercial nuclear
reactors in the country have told the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
that their systems might not work as required in an emergency, an
analysis of government data by a nuclear safety group showed on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The group, Critical Mass, based its analysis on reports over the
last three years made by operators who found that plant equipment
or procedures differed from what engineers specified in the safety
analyses required for the plants to be licensed.
</P>
<P>
   Of 111 reactors licensed for operation from October 1996 to May
1999, 102 reported over 500 instances of operating outside their
``design basis,'' or the conditions on which they were licensed,
the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The utility reports varied from ones about a fire door failing
to close during a test to others about the discovery of wiring
problems that would have prevented a safety system from working.
Many of the reports were made when a system broke down, though the
system was often the second of two redundant systems, which
nonetheless required that the plant be shut down.
</P>
<P>
   In one case employees at a Connecticut plant, Millstone 1, near
New London, pointed out that the company was moving hot nuclear
fuel faster than its license allowed. The Nuclear Regulatory
Commission ordered all reactors to examine their licenses, their
equipment and their operations, and report back on whether the
three matched.
</P>
<P>
   The report's author, James P. Riccio, wrote that the lapses had
created situations where ``a single event or condition could have
prevented the functioning of safety systems needed to shut down the
reactor.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry's trade
association, took the opposite tack. ``One has to note you do have
defense in depth built into the facility,'' a spokesman, Steve
Kerekes, said. ``That's the whole engineering principle.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, William F. Kane, the
associate director for inspection and programs, said all such
reports were carefully analyzed by the commission staff. He said
that there were more such reports in the last few years but that it
could be ``a function of how hard things are being looked at''
after the discovery of discrepancies at Millstone 1.

SILICON GRAPHICS EXPECTS LAYOFFS AND REVAMPING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Minn., Wis.)   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Silicon Graphics Inc., which has been mired in
losses and dwindling market share for much of the last four years,
plans to lay off 1,000 to 1,500 people, or up to 15 percent of its
work force, and sell or spin off several businesses, including the
Cray Research line of supercomputers.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said Tuesday that it would record a charge of
$100 million to $200 million in connection with the revamping.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Belluzzo, who became Silicon Graphics' chairman and
chief executive 18 months ago, has been working to turn the company
around. And, Silicon Graphics did surprise analysts with a profit
for its fourth quarter, which ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Tuesday's announcement indicates that the company
still faces major strategic and structural problems, which may or
may not be solved by this latest effort to sharpen its focus.
</P>
<P>
   Best known for building the computers used to create such
memorable special effects as the dinosaurs in the movies ``Jurassic
Park'' and ``The Lost World,'' Silicon Graphics enjoyed phenomenal
growth through the late 1980s and early 1990s. But growth slowed
late in 1995, and management has erred and new products have
fumbled, hurting the company's financial performance ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Silicon Graphics, which is based in Mountain View,
Calif., fell $3.75, or 23 percent, to $12.4375, on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Graphics said that it had formed a separate business
unit for Cray, which is based in Chippewa Falls, Wis., and Eagan,
Minn., and that it was in discussions with several companies
regarding a possible sale or partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it would spin off its Media Base media
streaming application, engineering team and technology to a newly
formed company with venture capital backing. It has previously
discussed finding a buyer for its Wavefront and Alias software
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Graphics also said it had reached a preliminary
understanding with a potential joint venture partner to take over
its Visual Workstation line of products based on Intel
microprocessors and Microsoft's Windows NT operating system.
Executives said terms of the deal had not been finalized and it is
not clear if Silicon Graphics would retain a major stake in the
joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced amid great fanfare in January, the NT machines were
supposed to broaden the company's reach to the low end of the
graphics market, but they were late to market, and have been
further plagued by production problems.
</P>
<P>
   If every aspect of the revamping is carried out, Silicon
Graphics will emerge as a smaller company focused primarily on
midsize high performance servers aimed at the Internet market. The
company will continue to produce its graphics work stations, which
use its own Irix version of the Unix operating system and MIPS
microprocessors, and will also develop products using the Linux
variant of Unix.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it is not clear Silicon Graphics would find buyers
or viable partners for the pieces of the business it wants to sell,
and noted that the entire company had effectively been for sale for
some time without takers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has been on the block for two years and nobody has
done anything,'' said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Belluzzo said that Silicon Graphics expected a loss from the
Windows NT work station business in its first fiscal quarter, but
that the other parts of the business remained profitable, and the
company should report a profit over all in the second quarter.

CLEMENS PITCHES SCORELESS GAME FOR 5 INNINGS, THEN ... OAKLAND WINS
6-1  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ At the moment Roger Clemens knew he was going
to be relieved Tuesday, when he saw Manager Joe Torre headed toward
the mound, Clemens stared downward. His catcher Jorge Posada walked
up and reassuringly tapped his glove on Clemens' side, and so did
first baseman Tino Martinez. But Clemens only glanced up a couple
of times before departing.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens wants to do better. He knows more is expected of him. He
knows he is expected to be the staff leader, the ace, the guy who
makes everybody else feel as if there is absolutely no chance the
Yankees will lose on the day he pitches. He knows he's not meeting
those expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Engaged in a scoreless game Tuesday, Clemens pitched himself
into trouble in the sixth inning, allowed four runs and the Yankees
went on to lose to the Athletics, 6-1. Omar Olivares, one of the
pitchers acquired by Oakland before the trade deadline 10 days ago,
pitched into the seventh inning and allowed just one run.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had won six straight games and 17 of their last 23;
they are playing better and building momentum during the last third
of the regular season. But Clemens - the most crucial Yankees'
puzzle in need of solving - remains an enigma. He allowed nine
hits, five walks and five runs in 6 1/3 innings Tuesday, raising
his ERA to 4.92. His record is 10-5, but Torre is sure Clemens'
desire to pitch better chafes at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a lot tougher if Roger is not pitching the
way Roger can pitch, and we need him very desperately, and I think
sometimes he is a little too analytical and he puts a little bit
too much on himself,'' said Torre, ``as opposed to going out there
and letting it happen. He may try to make it happen a little too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure Clemens places on himself, Torre said, ``is going
to relax here sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it is,'' the manager added. ``It gets to a point where
he's going to find it.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said he thought that maybe Clemens had found himself in
the last four innings of work in Seattle last week, when he shut
out the Mariners. But Clemens was unable to develop a second pitch
Tuesday to complement his fastball - a decent split-fingered
fastball or a consistent breaking ball.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite possible for a pitcher to win a game throwing just
one type of pitch for strikes; Clemens probably has done so dozen
of times in his career. To offset the lack of a secondary pitch,
Clemens needed to throw strikes early in the ball-strike count.
With a count of no balls and one strike, or 1-2, a hitter cannot
anticipate just one particular pitch; he must be on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens fell behind in the count over and over Tuesday. He
pitched himself into situations in which he needed to throw
strikes, and the Oakland hitters were well aware of the fact that
Clemens' fastball was really the only pitch he could rely on. When
Clemens fell behind in the count, he might as well have shouted to
the world that he was going to throw a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw hard today,'' said Torre, ``but the darn count got
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all great pitchers, Clemens managed to escape a few times.
The Athletics had two runners on and one out in the first and did
not score; they had runners at first and third and two out in the
third and did not score; they had a runner at second and one out in
the fifth and did not score.
</P>
<P>
   Twice the Athletics hit into double plays; Clemens has generated
a total of 12 double-play grounders this year, half coming in his
last four starts.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the sixth inning that Clemens' one-dimensional
stuff finally hurt him. Randy Velarde reached a 3-ball, 2-strike
count leading off. With the game scoreless and the middle of the
Oakland lineup ready to follow Velarde, Clemens had to throw a
strike; he had to throw his fastball. Velarde lined a single to
right field.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens walked Jason Giambi on seven pitches. First and second
and nobody out. Clemens tried to vary his pattern, throwing a
first-pitch slider to Matt Stairs, but it spun low for ball one.
Clemens threw ball two, and Stairs, assuming Clemens had to throw
fastballs, began to swing like a slugger in a lumberjack's
slow-pitch softball league. He fouled off one pitch, then hit into
a forceout.
</P>
<P>
   One out, first and third.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens threw three straight balls to Scott Spiezio, then a
strike, before he fouled off two pitches. Clemens had to throw a
strike. He had to throw a fastball. Spiezio was ready: He drove a
liner over the head of Bernie Williams in center, scoring Velarde,
and because Stairs quickly realized Williams could not catch the
ball, he scored, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Grieve followed, and again, Clemens pitched himself into a
corner, throwing three straight balls. He fired a strike, and
Grieve, too, correctly anticipated Clemens would throw a fastball.
When he did, Grieve crushed it, maybe 12-15 rows deep in the right
field stands. Oakland led, 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt tremendous out there today,'' said Clemens. ``I made
two mistakes, and both mistakes they hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens wants to be better. He wants to get on that Clemens-type
roll, and he's got about 8 or 9 starts left before the playoffs to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter has always been known as an inside-out hitter,
driving inside pitches and swatting them to right field for
singles. But in his current slump - his average has dropped from
.376 on July 20 to .350 - he has been pulling the ball to the left
side. Jeter has not made an out to the right side of the field
since his first at-bat in a game against Toronto Aug. 2, and
opposing pitchers have taken to pounding him with inside
fastballs... Outfielder Chad Curtis left the Yankees team to be
with Candace Curtis, his wife, for the birth of their third child. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the nation's latest inexplicable act of
violence, a balding, white, middle-aged man walked into a Jewish
community center in a middle-class suburb Tuesday morning and fired
as many as 30 shots, wounding five people, including three young
boys at a day camp, and then fled.
</P>
<P>
   A 3{-year-old boy who said he was just a few feet away from the
shooting _ his mother would only give his name as Eric _ said the
man said nothing before fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad monster ran away,'' said the boy, who clung to his
mother and asked her if any of the wounded children had done
anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   One of the victims, a 8-year-old boy, who had been shot in the
abdomen, was in critical but stable condition after surgery, while
Fire Department officials said the other four were in stable
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Police with dogs cordoned off the area around the North Valley
Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills to search for the suspect,
described as about 40 years old, but by Tuesday evening they had
not found him and believed he was no longer in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they had no idea who he was or why he opened fire
and that none of the people who saw the shooter at the center
recognized him.
</P>
<P>
   Officials asked residents of the neighborhood to remain indoors
as they conducted their search, but police lines quickly became
jammed with parents waiting anxiously to hear about their children.
</P>
<P>
   Within a half-hour after the shooting occurred at 10:45 a.m.,
helicopter crews from local television stations broadcast images of
police officers leading children out of the center by hand, in
strings of five, six and seven. Firefighters and paramedics at the
scene said the children had been orderly, though upset.
</P>
<P>
   The images of fleeing children, anxious parents and armed
officers searching alleys, sheds and homes in the area were
broadcast for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents who were reunited with their children in the street
then stayed in the area, hugging their children, chatting with
friends and other parents, apparently so stunned by the violence
that they seemed unconcerned that the shooter could still be in the
neighborhood. Around midday, the Fire Department brought a cooler
of drinks for parents, many who were still waiting for word on the
whereabouts of their children.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Shalometh Golden was quoted by the City News Service as
saying that her mother, Isabelle Shalometh, a receptionist at the
center, had been wounded lightly in the arm and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said a young man, a ruffian, she saw him coming at her and
I guess he just started open firing,'' Ms. Golden said, ``and she
knew enough to quickly duck down and she did.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire Department Capt. Steve Ruda said that in addition to Ms.
Shalometh, who he said was 65, a 16-year-old girl was shot in the
right thigh and shin, a 6-year-old boy was wounded in the left foot
and another 6-year-old boy was shot in the left leg and hip. The
most seriously sounded was the 8-year-old boy hit in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the shooter was between 5 feet 8 and 5 feet 10,
about 170 pounds, and was dressed in green clothing. He fired as
many as 30 shots from a 9-millimeter handgun, then apparently fled
on foot, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the police said that two young men had been
responsible, but later attributed that description to confusion by
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms sent
agents to the residential area, in the San Fernando Valley about 30
miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, to assist local police.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, the police were sifting through a number of
clues, whose relation remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. Police Cmdr. David Kalish said they had searched a red van
with Washington state license plates, in an area not far from the
shooting and had found ``an incredible amount of ammunition,'' a
bulletproof vest and ``substantial other evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Police also said that about noon there had been a carjacking in
which a white male who generally matched the description of the
shooter had stolen a dark green 1999 Toyota Corolla. The police
later said that the van's driver was the same man who had stolen
the car at gunpoint, and that they had been led to the van while
investigating the car theft.
</P>
<P>
   Because the incident followed a string of school shootings in
recent months, and comes in the middle of an intense debate over
the availability of firearms, it was followed closely by officials
across the state and in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said, ``Once again our nation has been shaken
and our hearts torn'' by what he called ``another senseless act of
gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   California Gov. Gray Davis said, ``Once again, we have been
shocked, saddened and outraged by an act of vicious gun violence
aimed against defenseless children and innocent adults.'' He
offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The North Valley Jewish Community Center is an educational and
recreation facility where the elderly come to play cards, parents
drop their toddlers off for pre-school, singles play tennis and
children learned to swim in the pool.
</P>
<P>
   There are after-school enrichment classes on gymnastics, karate,
cooking and celebrating the Sabbath. Children learned to make
traditional braided challah bread and how to celebrate the Jewish
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The ``little red schoolhouse,'' a small facility behind the main
building, houses the pre-school for children aged 2 and 3. The
pre-school's security rules required that parents sign children in
and out each day.
</P>
<P>
   Although the neighborhood is generally quiet, several residents
said there have been growing racial tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Trombley, 18, who graduated last year from the local high
school, said Granada Hills is largely white, with a mix of blue
collar and white collar families. But, he said, it borders on one
side a largely Asian neighborhood, and on another side a Latino
neighborhood, and there have been sporadic racial tensions, with
fights involving teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of life around here,'' he said. ``You just accept
it.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Far fewer students are being expelled for bringing
guns to school, the U.S. Department of Education reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a new state-by-state survey comparing the academic year
1997-1998 to the previous year, the department found that
expulsions for carrying firearms onto school property dropped by
nearly a third, from 5,724 students to 3,930.
</P>
<P>
   The study is the second examination of how schools around the
country are implementing the Gun-Free School Act, a federal law
passed in 1994 requiring that school districts expel any student
who brings a weapon to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot compromise the safety of the millions of students
who do obey the rules by allowing those who do not to remain in the
same classrooms,'' said Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley at
a news conference here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Based on reports submitted by the states, the survey found that
62 percent of the expulsions were for handguns; 31 percent for
other types of firearms, including bombs, grenades and starter
pistols; and 7 percent for rifles or shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than half the cases were at high schools.
Thirty-three percent were at junior high schools and 10 percent at
elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   California and Texas reported the most incidents, with more than
300 expulsions, though the number declined for both states, by 47
percent and 20 percent, respectively. New York state registered
about a 30 percent drop, from 128 to 91. Wyoming has not expelled
any students for firearm violations in the two years surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the overall percentage declined, 20 states reported
increases, including Oklahoma (0 to 17), Delaware (7 to 29) and
Tennessee (98 to 192).
</P>
<P>
   The quality of data collection varied widely, researchers
warned, with some states making no distinction for type of weapon
or for school level. Researchers also cautioned that the data does
not provide insight into how many students carry guns to school,
but rather whether they are being disciplined for violations.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are in line with other youth violence studies. The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a study released
last week, found that violence committed by teen-agers has declined
this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of high school students carrying a weapon dropped
from 26 percent in 1991 to 19 percent in 1997, according to that
report, published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new and promising data, coupled with last week's findings
from the Centers for Disease Control, shows that fewer young people
are carrying guns or taking them into schools,'' Riley said. ``This
is good news coupled with the fact that the overall rate of school
violence is down. But communities need to continue to use
comprehensive approaches to keeping schools, students and educators
safe.''

   ASUNCION, Paraguay _ When Martin Almada asked a judge for
records of his arrest under the dictatorship of General Alfredo
Stroessner, he hoped merely to learn more about his own private
tragedy: nearly four years of captivity, during which police
telephoned his wife so she would hear his screams under torture.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Almada, a one-time school teacher, and the judge
unearthed a mountain of records detailing repression among
U.S.-backed military regimes throughout South America during the
Cold War. From floor to ceiling, five tons of reports and photos
detailed the arrest, interrogation and disappearance of thousands
of political prisoners during Stroessner's 35-year dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   The documents trace the creation and work of Operation Condor, a
secret plan among security forces in six countries to crush
left-wing political dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Paraguayans quickly nicknamed the files the ``archives of
terror.'' Though discovered in 1992, the files have gained new
prominence throughout Latin America with the arrest of Chile's
former dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, in London last October. To
this day, they remain the only extensive collection of public
records of a project by the region's military rulers that succeeded
in exterminating thousands of political opponents, many of whom had
sought sanctuary in one another's countries.
</P>
<P>
   The files have given a kind of vindication to survivors, their
families and the families of those dead and missing, by delivering
concrete proof of a secretive era that might otherwise be lost in
the ether of memory and denial.
</P>
<P>
   The archives have also provided fodder for the developing case
against Pinochet, the only one of the region's dictators to face
the prospect of trial. Stroessner remains a fugitive in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Baltazar Garzon, the Spanish magistrate seeking the extradition
of Pinochet from England, has collected more than 1,500 pages of
evidence from the archives. Last December, he requested records on
Bolivia's current President, Hugo Banzer, who ran the military
regime there from 1971 to 1978, and on Stroessner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This documentation might exist in other countries as well, but
it's hidden, while in Paraguay they didn't manage to hide it all,''
Juan Garces, the lawyer who brought the suit against Pinochet, said
in a telephone interview from Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It proves that there was an organization with a structure and
discipline that didn't only exchange information but committed
criminal acts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence sharing between Washington's allies in South
America did not begin with Operation Condor, but the plan
formalized and deepened cooperation among police and military
forces that had taken power in six countries _ Brazil, Argentina,
Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   After Gen. Manuel Contreras of Chile invited security chiefs to
create ``the basis of an excellent coordination and improved
action'' at a meeting in November 1975, police from member
countries began to operate in each others' jurisdictions. Their new
ties allowed security officials to participate in joint
interrogations, to pursue nationals across borders and to order
surveillance on citizens who sought asylum in other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Trained during the Cold War at the School of the Americas in
Panama, the officials viewed their enemy as Communism, backed by
Moscow in a subversive war without frontiers. To prevail,
governments, too, would have to work across borders, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The security threats were not entirely imagined. Armed rebels
like the Montoneros in Argentina did aim to destabilize some
governments. But in other countries there were no rebel movements,
and military regimes used the club of anti-Communism to snuff out
any calls for democracy or labor rights.
</P>
<P>
   In Chile, Pinochet had overthrown the democratically elected
president, Salvador Allende Gossens, a Socialist, and hunted down
his Cabinet officials and supporters. Among them was Orlando
Letelier, the Chilean ambassador to the United States who was
killed when his car exploded on a street in Washington; his
American aide, Ronni Moffitt, also was killed.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1979 Senate Foreign Relations Report, which
remains classified, the killings in Argentina of Gen. Carlos Prats
of Chile and Gen. Juan Jose Torres of Bolivia were also reportedly
the work of Operation Condor, as was the attempted assassination of
a Chilean senator, Bernardo Leighton, in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In Paraguay, the targets of Stroessner included members of a
rival faction in the governing Colorado Party, doctors who refused
to cover up torture and Almada, who had criticized the educational
system in his doctoral dissertation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I was an intellectual terrorist,'' Almada said. He
blames Paraguayan police for the death of his 33-year-old wife, who
suffered a heart attack and died after hearing his screams over the
telephone.

SECURITY TIGHTENED AT L.A. DAY-CARE CENTERS, PARKS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Just moments after the shooting at the day camp
in Los Angeles' north San Fernando Valley, frantic parents deluged
day-care centers across the San Fernando Valley with calls while
the centers locked their doors and arranged to send children home.
</P>
<P>
   City park and recreation programs near the shooting also took
emergency measures to ensure the safety of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some lunatic is loose, who knows if somebody could come
here,'' said Sandy Tandler as she picked up her daughter Tuesday at
the Bernard Milken Jewish Community Center in the West Hills
community. ``We have no idea what this guy could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Rouss, executive vice president of Jewish Community Centers
of Los Angeles, said officials have stepped up security at their
other 12 sites in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Unsure whether the gunman was targeting Jewish centers, the
Bernard Milken campus, a sister faclity of the North Hills Jewish
Community Center, asked the Los Angeles police to send officers and
called parents to pick up children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are horrified. We are saddened by this,'' said Jack Mayer,
executive director of The Jewish Federation/Valley Alliance in West
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   At Children's Wonderland in the Warner Center in the Woodland
Hills community of the Valley, a secular day-care center, officials
canceled parent tours of the facility, locked all doors that led
onto the street and kept children indoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not allowing anybody inside the premises who doesn't
belong here,'' said Mary Willoughby, assistant director of the
center, which received dozens of calls from alarmed parents.
</P>
<P>
   Willoughby said it will take a long time to recover from the
emotional fallout. ``The teachers are a little uneasy; the parents
are uneasy; we're all emotionally upset,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Soboroff, president of the city's Recreation and Parks
Commission, said all nearby parks and recreation centers
immediately went into an emergency operation after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it's no in-no out,'' Soboroff said. ``Any kids who
are in a program are immediately taken care of, and we don't let
any people in the buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Steve Tucker of Temple Ramat Zion in Northridge said
children in day care were moved to a locked area and parents called
to take them home.
</P>
<P>
   At Temple B'Nai Hayim Children's Center in Sherman Oaks,
officials hustled their 20 charges indoors as soon as they heard
the news. ``We took children inside right away, and we stayed away
from the windows,'' said Tatyana Ingel, head teacher of the
temple's preschool.
</P>
<P>
   At Temple Beth Hillel, a reform congregation in North Hollywood,
officials considered hiring a security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish temples and preschools in the Simi Valley and Thousand
Oaks areas north of Los Angeles opted to stay open following
Tuesday's shooting.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer was stationed at Congregation B'Nai Emet in
Simi Valley until the 18 children at the Reform temple's summer day
camp went home for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no threat, no reason to believe there will be any
problems,'' police Sgt. Bob Gardner ``They were just feeling a
little uncomfortable.''

 ASUNCION, Paraguay: the telephone. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Two of the thousands of cases contained in the archives are
those of Gladys Sannemann and Augustin Goiburu, physicians in
Asuncion who refused to falsify an autopsy to show that a man
beaten to death under police custody in 1958 had died of natural
causes. Instead, Sannemann took the cadaver to her medical school
in Asuncion and performed a proper autopsy before her students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practically from that moment it began,'' said Sannemann, an
immunologist who is now 69 and practicing here in Asuncion. The
challenge marked her out for the Stroessner regime.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking safety, Sannemann and her husband, Rodolfo Jorge, fled
to Brazil in 1963, a year before the military seized power there,
and then moved to Argentina. But in March 1976, the military took
power in Argentina as well, making Sannemann and other exiles
targets of the new regime.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the coup, Argentine police abducted Sannemann and
tortured her at the Escuela Mecanica in Buenos Aires. Sannemann
said she was bound and plunged into a bathtub of vomit and
excrement, in a torture nicknamed ``the submarine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They accused me of killing a patient in my office,'' Sannemann
said, calling the charge ``a total lie.'' Then police falsely
accused her of selling drugs, she recalled. ``They said anything
that occurred to them,'' she said. A week later, Sannemann's
husband was abducted and tortured as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sannemann landed at the Emboscada camp for political prisoners
in Paraguay, where she treated more than 400 fellow prisoners from
several South American countries, including widows whose husbands
had been executed _ to silence them _ and their children .
</P>
<P>
   Sannemann and her husband were eventually given asylum in
Germany in 1997, after the German government pressured Argentina
for their release.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Goiburu, who also refused to whitewash torture,
remained a mystery until the archives were opened. In 1977, Goiburu
was kidnapped from a street in Missiones, an Argentine town where
he had gone to escape the Stroessner regime. The government
steadily denied any knowledge of Goiburu's disappearance to his
wife, ElbaElisa Benitez de Goiburu.
</P>
<P>
   The archives, however, contained surveillance reports and photos
of the doctor's house and office, and showed that eliminating him
had become a priority for Stroessner. In a bitterly comic twist,
one effort to kidnap Goiburu collapsed after the Paraguayans balked
at the price Argentine agents demanded for the job, according to
documents in the archive.
</P>
<P>
   Stroessner declined repeated requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Goiburu said she has no doubt that it was Condor that had
swooped down to persecute her family and eventually to take her
husband's life, though he has never been found.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The archives do not detail Washington's role in Cold War
repression here. Along with documents surfacing elsewhere, however,
they suggest U.S. officials backed Condor nations not only with
military aid, but with information. Last month, the United States
declassified 20,000 pages of documents from the Cold War era,
mostly involving Chile. Some of them have made their way to Garzon.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The archives here show that a U.S. military official, Col.
Robert Thierry, apparently helped design the apparatus of the
police state, as he trained police for the Technical Section soon
after Stroessner seized power here in 1954. A relative, Margaret
Van Skike, located in Galveston, Texas, said that Thierry died
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the FBI released a document confirming that
it had provided the Pinochet regime with information about Jorge
Isaac Fuentes de Alarcon, the leader of a leftist movement in Chile
who, the archives here show, was first seized and interrogated by
Paraguayan agents. FBI officers checked addresses in the United
States found in Fuentes' personal phone book, and gave the results
and information on Fuentes' questioning in Paraguay to the Pinochet
regime. Fuentes later disappeared under Chilean custody.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The archives here include friendly letters, law enforcement
magazines and books from the FBI to Paraguayan police officials
whose human rights records had come under fire even then.
</P>
<P>
   In one letter, FBI Director Clarence Kelley wishes Pastor
Coronel, the long-time head of the Department of Investigations who
is now serving a 25-year sentence for torture, ``a truly joyous
Christmas and a New Year filled with all the good things you so
richly deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley died two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The archives also shed light on the killing of Letelier, the
ambassador, in Washington. Two weeks before the assassination,
Contreras, the Chilean colonel, requested $600,000 from the
Pinochet government for ``the neutralization of the governing
junta's principal adversaries overseas, especially in Mexico,
Argentina, Costa Rica, the United States, France and Italy'' in a
memo.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the FBI defended the information sharing with
Chile as standard practice among law enforcement agencies of
governments friendly to Washington. A State Department spokesman
declined to comment on the record of U.S. cooperation with the
South American dictatorships, saying it was ``ancient history.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the archives in 1992, coming as Paraguayans
tackled their first democratic presidential elections, brought
euphoria at first.
</P>
<P>
   As news of the trove spread, victims of the dictatorship flocked
to the police station at Lambare, some 15 miles outside the
capital. Mrs. Goiburu sought word about her husband. Sannemann came
in disbelief. Gloria Estrago, a former political prisoner, felt as
if she had stumbled onto ``the Vatican's secret treasures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like finding our comrades alive again, like
something from science fiction,'' said Ms. Estrago, who is now a
judge.
</P>
<P>
   When she saw the files, Ms. Estrago said she imagined an old
friend who had vanished in police custody, Mario Sher Prono,
calling out to her now, saying, ``Here's proof of what happened to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many activists, early exhilaration has given way to
disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   Upon discovery of the archives, they complain, journalists,
police, and even victims like Almada hauled away cartons of
records. Key documents published in newspapers days after their
discovery vanished from the archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt they have been sanitized,'' Ms. Palau said.
</P>
<P>
   The archives, at least now, contain no direct accounts of
tortures or deaths, only of prisoners who police arrested but never
released, and formulaic confessions that say nothing about the
methods used to obtain them. Gaps in the sequences of numbered
letters from the FBI suggest missing correspondence. And the
archives do not address the military's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Only five officials here have been convicted for torturing and
killing Paraguayans who challenged the Stroessner dictatorship.
None have apologized for their acts or broken the security forces'
code of silence. Nobody has said where the bodies are buried.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Goiburu said the present government has pressured her to
drop efforts to find her husband's killer, as well as a lawsuit
against Stroessner for her husband's disappearance. Recently,
Paraguay's new president, Luis Gonzalez Macchi, dismissed her from
her job representing the Ministry of Education and Culture in a
national professional association, and Mrs. Goiburu said she has
been warned not to challenge the move.
</P>
<P>
   The dictatorship is over, the widow said, but the reflexes of
terror linger on.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the fractious world of Off Off Broadway, it was
bound to happen. The Fringe has developed a fringe.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Wednesday, the downtown theater scene will be witness
to the opening of two simultaneous festivals, each based on the
Lower East Side and each purporting to represent the rich variety
among the city's littlest and least-known theater troupes.
</P>
<P>
   This year's newcomer is the Pure Pop Theater Festival, which
will kick off just hours after the first show of the New York
International Fringe Festival, now in its third summer.
</P>
<P>
   Pure Pop's organizers promise to match the Fringe quirk for
quirk, with programming that includes a rarely seen temperance play
(``Ten Nights in a Barroom'' by William Pratt), an 18th-century
Japanese epic (``The Battles of Coxinga'' by Chikamatsu Monzaemon)
and several shows with titles not suitable for a family newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Pure Pop promises to stage nearly 60 productions
over seven weeks (through Oct. 3), at sites ranging from the Queens
Theater in the Park to Theater 4S, a 15-seater in an East Village
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Fringe will present some 150 productions in 12
days, through Aug. 29, an ambitious schedule that includes theater,
dance and performance art. Here, too, some of the titles suggest a
deep immersion in the odd: ``Urinetown,'' an original musical, and
``Jinkies,'' a series of Scooby Doo episodes based on the
television cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a revival of the Robert Wilson-Tom Waits-William
S. Burroughs rock opera ``The Black Rider,'' which was staged at
the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Does downtown really need all this? Aaron Beall, the founder of
Pure Pop, answers: ``Nobody's saying to Lincoln Center, `Hey, too
many festivals, guys! Too much creativity! You've got to stop it!
Why do you need the Mozart? You just did Schubert! Enough with the
Mendelssohn!'''
</P>
<P>
   Pure Pop and the Fringe have a shared history. Beall (pronounced
Bell) was a founder of the Fringe, but earlier this year he had a
falling out with a co-founder, John Clancy, and left to start Pure
Pop. ( Beall is also the founder of Todo Con Nada, a storefront
theater on Ludlow Street, and Clancy is also the artistic director
of the downtown theater group Present Company).
</P>
<P>
   Beall's departure led to rumors _ and news reports _ of a
vitriolic crisis in the heart of the city's Off Off Broadway
community. But Clancy and Beall, who are both 35, say there is
little animus between them. They ascribe the fight to personality
differences and some grumbling over dividing box office receipts.
Each man's company lost money on the two previous Fringe festivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When times are tight, a little bit of money gets to be very
important,'' Clancy said at the Theatorium, the Fringe's
headquarters and mainstage on Stanton Street. ``But Aaron and I are
getting along.''
</P>
<P>
   What the two men can also agree on is that their festivals
represent only a part of what is going on Off Off Broadway, which
many on the scene say is in the midst of a period of remarkable
popularity, economic growth and structural change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's an influx of extraordinary people working in
the scene right now,'' said the playwright Mac Wellman, a stalwart
of downtown theater. ``And a lot of them don't want to make it in
the traditional way.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many in the new generation of theater artists and
downtown producers have begun to exhibit the professional trappings
of larger institutions: press agents, marketing plans and
six-figure annual budgets.
</P>
<P>
   The Fringe and Pure Pop are no exception: the Fringe has a
budget of $180,000; Pure Pop about a third of that. Beall, in
particular, is something of a media hound, talking up his festival
with the showy optimism of a circus barker. ``It's the beginning of
festival season,'' he said recently, smiling over a plate of sushi
near Todo Con Nada. ``You got to make the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   While Beall was with the Fringe, he aggressively promoted the
festival in radio and television interviews; with Pure Pop, he has
taken to dyeing his hair _ blue, most recently _ for effect. He is
also pushing Pure Pop in interviews and on the Internet as the
first season in a ``99-year plan'' to save Off Off Broadway from
what he complains is invasive real estate development.
</P>
<P>
   Beall's fears aside, much of downtown theater is blooming
Critical praise has begun to follow young companies like Elevator
Repair Service and playwrights like Richard Maxwell, the author of
``House.'' That play toured Europe this summer after good reviews
in New York; Elevator Repair Service's ``Total Fictional Lie'' will
tour five American cities this fall and winter.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Target Margin's acclaimed 1998 production of ``Mamba's
Daughters'' was the headliner at the Spoleto Festival in
Charleston, S.C., in May. The chamber musical ``Running Man,'' a
March production at HERE in SoHo, was a finalist for the Pulitzer
Prize, while the winner, ``Wit,'' had its New York premiere at the
99-seat MCC Theater on West 28th Street.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Commercial success stories have been more hit and miss. Downtown
shows like ``Shakespeare's R&AMP;J,'' which began at the tiny Expanded
Arts theater on Ludlow Street, had a long commercial Off Broadway
run, as did ``Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,''
which began Off Off Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, last season's commercial transfers of the
Adobe Theater Company's ``Duet!'' and Premium Bob's ``Manhunt''
were not successful in larger auditoriums.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown theater isn't even always downtown anymore. ``Three
Virgins,'' developed by the experimental company Collapsable
Giraffe, reclaimed Show World, a former sex superstore on Eighth
Avenue near 42d Street, as a theatrical space.
</P>
<P>
   Such activity has jumped the rivers, too, spreading to hot
neighborhoods like Dumbo in Brooklyn, where the experimental troupe
Gale Gates et al. has its own 40,000-square-foot performance space.
An additional large performance space and gallery, Smack Mellon,
has opened in an old spice factory.
</P>
<P>
   While the technical definition of Off Off Broadway is any
theater with less than 100 seats, the term is also emblematic of
the artistic standards of a movement that was born in the early
1960s. Those criteria _ being noncommercial, experimental and, in
the words of the director Richard Caliban, ``off the radar'' _ are
still embraced by a majority of downtown theater artists. But the
term has also had its less flattering associations.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, when I started, it seemed Off Off Broadway was
synonymous with bad,'' said Jeremy Dobrish, the artistic director
of the Adobe Theater. ``It was like, `I'm going to go, it's going
to be hot, it's going to be cramped, the people won't know what
they're doing, it will be pretentious and alienating, and I'm not
going to have a good time.'' But, he said, downtown theater in New
York is ``different now,'' more like ``the independent film
scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with some 20 downtown theater artists supported
the notion that changes were afoot, though some said the reasons
might be more personal than professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were all just sick of playing for our friends,''
said Jim Findlay, the co-artistic director of Collapsable Giraffe.
``I'd rather have an audience of 25 people I don't know than 40
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that has had an effect is dwindling government
support. ``This generation of artists came up not expecting to get
a grant,'' said Mark Russell, the executive director of Performance
Space 122 in the East Village. ``All these guys came of age after
the N.E.A. Four and the Karen Finley episode. You say Karen Finley,
and they have a blank look on their faces. It's like Kennedy
getting shot. They don't remember it.''
</P>
<P>
   (In 1990, Ms. Finley and three other performance artists had
their federal grants revoked by the National Endowment for the Arts
after conservative Congressmen objected to using government money
for what was deemed by some to be obscene art.)
</P>
<P>
   The new climate, Clancy said, has made Off Off Broadway more
self-sufficient: ``The 1990s are really a time when people started
thinking in a businesslike fashion _ if you're going to keep your
doors open, you're going to have to earn money. And part of that is
understanding that you're in the service industry. and that that
goes not only for the art but also the conditions.'' In short,
cramped basements and creaky folding chairs are out;
air-conditioning and comfortable seating are in.
</P>
<P>
   But does all this spit and polish mean that downtown theater has
lost its edge? One elder statesman said he had found indications of
trouble. ``I haven't seen anyone walking out angrily like they did
from my work,'' said Richard Foreman, the experimental director.
``That's a bad sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Young downtown types scoff at the thought that they have gone
soft. And, to be sure, gratuitous nudity, violence and simulated
kinky sex can still be found in a number of shows. Some say,
though, that the content of downtown theater work has become more
populist _ more easily accessible and less cynical. But part of
that, said David Latham of the Premium Bob troupe, has to do with
``shock fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who hasn't seen someone urinate onstage?'' asked Latham.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a Finley-style controversy, directors agree that
government grants for small companies have diminished during the
1990s, while private support has improved and corporate support has
dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   David Herskovits, the artistic director of Target Margin, said
the losses in corporate support have been ``particularly
disgraceful,'' considering the money being made in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But what of the boom? Has there been a trickle down?
</P>
<P>
   Off Off Broadway producers are divided. Some say that New York's
economic resurgence has caused nothing but headaches, raising rents
and production costs. Dixon Place, a performance space on the
Bowery, recently announced it would have to move because its rent
had been increased; other theater spaces and companies are still
operating hand-to-mouth.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``What Off Off Broadway means,'' said Jeff Sugg, a lighting
designer, ``is you still (italics)ask(end italics) if you're
getting paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say the boom has made downtown fashionable and safe
again, a comfortable place for monied audiences and producers to
seek out new work.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the peripheral benefits. ``There are literally
175 new condos being built next door to us and they were
(italics)expensive,''(end italics) said Michelle Stern, a
co-founder of Gale Gates. ``So we have an audience literally right
next door that walks by every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The influx of young people into the city is also being felt.
``Broadway is always talking about trying to get a young audience,
but I go to see one of these shows at HERE, or the Ontological, or
the Flea, and I feel like I'm clubbing,'' said Stephen Nunns, a
director and an editor for American Theater magazine. ``It's the
most beautiful audience I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The roster of popular downtown theater spaces has expanded in
the last few years. Newer ones like Access Theater in TriBeCa and
the Present Company's Theatorium on the Lower East Side are home to
a steady stream of work of their own as well as that of renters.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of theaters like HERE, the SoHo Rep and the
Workhouse Theater (now known as the Flea Theater). Of the older
performance spaces, P.S. 122 on First Avenue and Ninth Street, the
Ontological at St. Mark's Church and Second Avenue, the Ohio
Theater and the Performing Garage, both on Wooster Street in SoHo,
are still vibrant breeding grounds for young artists.
</P>
<P>
   And look at them come. ``More and more training schools churn
out more and more actors who arrive in New York City,'' said Beall
of the Pure Pop Festival. ``And it becomes harder and harder for
younger theater artists to carve out a spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is where, ironically, the Fringe Festival comes in. The
Fringe's role is to ``provide access and opportunity to talent
without reputation and without resources and without cash and
without experience,'' said Clancy. But some larger companies, he
added, have also begun to look at the Fringe as a place to present
work in its early stages.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clancy acknowledged, most of the
better-established companies have little motivation to perform at
his festival, where several companies share the same theater and
where turnaround time between different shows can be as little as
15 minutes. ``For a company like Elevator Repair Service,'' he
said, ``is this going to serve them? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   John Collins, the artistic director of Elevator Repair Service,
said: ``All these festivals are working at the very basic level,
and though I probably shouldn't say this, some of it can be really
awful stuff. But that's a great kind of evidence that companies are
still generating raw material, and the festivals keep trying to
give the work a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, those involved in downtown theater seem to
respect the Fringe. ``I asked someone about the Fringe and they
said, `It's cheap, and we get a venue for our play,''' Herskovits
said. ``And I said, ``Fantastic. That's all you need.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not, of course, that they don't have a few suggestions: more
international programming for one, and oh, yes, more good stuff.
Clancy said he's working on it.
</P>

once filled his ears in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perplexing,'' is the way the manager puts it.
</P>
<P>
   The fans jeered bad pitching during the three losses, starting
Saturday night when the bullpen blew a lead and the Mets could not
deliver the tying run from third base with nobody out in the ninth.
The players are aware of the quick booing, Manager Bobby Valentine
said, ``particularly if it's the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``No one likes it, to be certain.''
</P>
<P>
   In such an environment, even the totally defensible tactic of
using a position player like Matt Franco to pitch an inning in a
blowout, as Valentine did Sunday, suddenly becomes suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to do it, but it just makes sense to save your
staff,'' said the manager, perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   In much of the world _ even the hangin'-jury world of baseball
fans _ three losses would constitute a vexing but normal little
slump. In New York, it brings out the werewolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans are great,'' Valentine said Tuesday night, ``but
sometimes you get a vocal minority that gives a bad name to the
majority.''
</P>
<P>
   All this negativity comes from otherwise sweet and positive New
Yorkers who Hillary Clinton wants to join. The amazing thing is
that the Mets had been rolling since Valentine suggested he had
only 55 games to turn the team around or he would be gone. He is
still here, his team in contention for the playoffs, and his mental
gears are still whirring away, quite often productively.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the manager even took a shot from Tom Seaver, no
less, for using Franco in the ninth inning of a 14-3 horror show.
Some of the reaction after the game was as if Valentine were doing
something totally ludicrous and demeaning that had never been done
before.
</P>
<P>
   After Valentine used Franco (for the second time this season)
the other day, I thumbed through a record book and came up with a
highly unofficial and probably incomplete list of more than 100
players who have pitched a game or three, either as a late-season
lark or, more recently in this age of specialization and pitch
counts, to save a weary pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Among the recognizable players who have made cameo appearances
as pitchers were: Cap Anson, Wade Boggs, Hal Chase, Ty Cobb, Rocky
Colavito, Dave Concepcion, Jose Canseco, Rick Cerone, Chili Davis,
Jimmie Foxx, Terry Francona, Mickey Hatcher, Jim Hickman, Harry
Hooper, Tom Hutton, Dave Kingman, Vance Law, Pepper Martin, Gene
Michael, Terry Moore, Stan Musial, Jeff Newman, Paul O'Neill, Jose
Oquendo, Bill Pecota, Tris Speaker, Honus Wagner, Tim Wallach, Mark
Whiten and Glenn Wilson _ as well as the Mets' third-base coach,
Cookie Rojas, who pitched an inning for Gene Mauch in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same situation,'' Rojas was saying Tuesday night. ``We were
losing a doubleheader, and we wanted to save pitchers for the next
game. It made sense to use me for an inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas, who pitched in high school, did not give up a run in his
inning, but his evaluation Tuesday night of his repertory was,
``Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gene Mauch made the move in 1967, it was sound baseball.
When Ralph Houk used his shortstop, Gene Michael, and the aging
strong-armed slugger Rocky Colavito one day in 1968 _ Colavito was
the winning pitcher; you could look it up _ it was a stroke of
genius. When Valentine does it, he is defiling the great game of
baseball. Perplexing, as the man said.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, the Mets' pitching staff is running low, what
with injuries and weariness. Valentine does not absolve himself
from the strain on the staff.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night he brought in the 37-year-old relief pitcher
Billy Taylor, who promptly gave up a home run. Valentine took the
blame, saying he should have been aware that Taylor has been a
closer with Oakland, not used to warming up three and four times
during a game. On Sunday, Rick Reed had to leave the game with a
strained finger, and Masato Yoshii, normally a starter, promptly
gave up a three-run homer to a pitcher, Darren Dreifort. On Monday,
Orel Hershiser, who has been solid, was bombed early.
</P>
<P>
   The fans were right on everybody's case, more capricious than
the tide, but just as relentless. Perplexing.

   DENVER _ Brian Rohrbough remembers the promise he and other
anxious parents made on April 20 as they stood outside Columbine
High School waiting to see if their children had made it out alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were saying, `if my child is OK, he or she will never
set foot in that school again,''' Rohrbough said. Although his
15-year-old son, Daniel, was among the 13 killed in the school that
day, he wants other parents to make good on that promise. ``It's
amazing that people have already forgotten the terror,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To Rohrbough and many others who recently attended ``Education
Options,'' a seminar here sponsored by local home-school groups,
public schools no longer represent a safe haven for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you going to trust these people who let Eric Harris make
videotapes that showed how he would shoot up the school?''
Rohrbough said, referring to one of the shooters. ``Is that the
type of environment you want your kids in?''
</P>
<P>
   Such thoughts may have been on the minds of parents across the
state in the weeks after the shooting, when inquiries to groups
that work with home-schoolers swelled.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Department of Education, which usually gets about
40 calls a month, saw a 60 percent increase, said Suzy Parker, the
department's home-schooling consultant. ``Some people specifically
mentioned Columbine as their reason for wanting to home-school. One
woman said her son was physically ill at the idea of returning to
school.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Home Educators of Colorado said calls to its small
office quadrupled after the killings, to about 75 a day, and the
Jefferson County school district, where Columbine is located, saw a
flurry as well.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects these inquiries to translate into perceptible
enrollment declines at schools this September, even at Columbine,
which like many schools has yet to complete fall enrollment.
``We're not seeing a great mass exodus from Columbine,'' said Jane
Hammond, the superintendent of schools for Jefferson County.
</P>
<P>
   But by most accounts, fear and safety have become new factors
for those considering schooling at home.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Ray, president of the National Home Education Research
Institute in Salem, Ore., said, ``Traditionally, people chose to
home-school for four reasons: to strengthen family relationships,
to pass on particular beliefs and values, strong academics and
guided social interactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it's too early to have hard data on how many families
are home-schooling because of violence,'' he added, ``in the past
couple of years we are seeing more parents concerned with safety at
school, whether it's physical violence or illegal drugs or
psychological and emotional safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of school-age children being taught at home is
estimated at 700,000 to 1.5 million. In Colorado, 8,827 students
were registered to be schooled at home in the fall of 1998, with
699,135 enrolled in public schools. In Jefferson County, 874
children were being taught at home and 88,654 at public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, individuals who put their children in the public
schools seemed to take the `Lake Wobegon' average _ that fictitious
place from the radio show where all the men are strong, the women
are beautiful and the children are above average,'' Ray said. ``But
when something dramatic happens, they think, `this could be us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Experienced home-schoolers are quick to point out that keeping
children out of school is no guarantee of safety. ``I think people
get the wrong perspective that they will stay in their own home all
day long,'' said Janice Quitmeyer of the Christian Home Educators
of Colorado. ``My kids go where I go during the day _ to the post
office, the grocery store. Look at the number of violent crimes,
and a very minor number of those take place in schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while shootings like those at Columbine incite a sense
that the nation's schools are under siege, studies show that youth
violence has been declining for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Sherie Ferguson has decided to pull her 16-year-old
daughter, Brandi, out of Bear Creek High School this fall. ``If you
had told me five months ago that I would be facing this, I would
have shook my head,'' said Ms. Ferguson, a single mother in
Lakewood, also in Jefferson County. ``I had total blind faith in
the schools, but I am not going to play Russian roulette with her
life. I just can't do it. She thinks about where she'd run and how
she'd get out of her school if it happened to her. How do you study
and concentrate like that?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferguson talks with pride about the ``school'' she and
Brandi have set up in their kitchen _ a computer with a printer and
scanner, a science laboratory with a microscope and an anatomically
correct human model, complete with internal organs. Educational
requirements vary from state to state for home schooling, which has
been legal in all 50 states for the past 15 years; Colorado
requires four hours of teaching a day, 172 days a year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferguson admits: ``We're pretty nervous _ this is new to us.
I'm only going to teach the courses I'm comfortable with, like
Spanish and literature, and then she will also do correspondence
and college courses.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandi, who told her mother that she was too afraid to return to
school, said she would stay in touch with friends from school. ``I
will miss the prom and the senior yearbook, but I can still call my
friends,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Kramer is also still deciding how best to educate her
daughter, Jess, 13, so she and her husband attended the seminar
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Jess, a student at Summit Middle School, remembers sitting at a
school lunch table planning escape routes. ``At lunch we would talk
about what we would do if it happened to us _ would we go out this
door and stuff like that,'' she said. ``The idea of someone coming
in with a bomb made us really, really scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kramer said she was horrified at the idea of a group of
eighth graders facing such issues. ``You never know how kids are
going to react to one another, and kids can be cruel,'' she said.
``I don't think any child should have to walk through the doors of
an educational system and think about fear.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Jon DeStefano, the Jefferson County school
board president, met with the school district's safety task force
at its last gathering before school resumes. The district will add
extra video cameras and campus supervisors as and will require
students and staff members to wear visible identification tags.
</P>
<P>
   In thanking the committee for the summer's work, DeStefano
concluded, ``It's going to take some time, as parents and as a
community, to feel safe again.''

LYCOS WON'T RENEW JEWS FOR JESUS AD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SARA NEUFELD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a case pitting free expression against user protest in the
new world of on-line advertising, Lycos Inc., a major Internet
search engine, will not renew an advertisement placed by Jews for
Jesus, after a flood of complaints from the Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   Jews for Jesus paid $1,700 for a banner to appear at the top of
computer screens of the first 40,000 people who type in the word
``Jewish'' as a search term, said Jews for Jesus spokeswoman Susan
Perlman.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which began in the early 1970s, has about 70,000
followers nationwide who, it says, practice Judaism while believing
that Jesus is the Messiah. The banner that Lycos has run advertises
a book by the group's executive director promoting that ideology.
</P>
<P>
   The contract for the advertisement is scheduled to expire within
a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Controversial advertising is bad for business,'' said Jeffrey
Snider, general counsel for Lycos. He said the decision not to
renew had nothing to do with the content of the advertisement, but
emphasized that the company does not want Jews to boycott Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Perlman said Tuesday she had not been informed of Lycos's
decision, and argued that the Internet, by its nature, is a forum
to express a variety of viewpoints and therefore is inherently
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may as well find another planet to operate from if they
don't want controversy,'' she said. ``We're saddened that they have
succumbed to pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Jews for Jesus, which typically has spread its message through
fliers and leaflets, placed the advertisement through a sales
representative in Lycos's San Francisco office, Snider said. To
reach a targeted audience, customers pay Lycos to link their ads
with search terms.
</P>
<P>
   Perlman said Jews for Jesus chose to have its name attached to
the search term ``Jewish'' under the assumption that many Jews
would see it.
</P>
<P>
   They were right.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ad started running July 6, executives at Lycos's
national headquarters in Waltham, Mass. said they were not aware of
it until they received several angry e-mail messages from Jews
beginning on July 29. The company would not discuss the content of
the messages or say how many it received.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are not Jews and are ignorant about Judiasm,''
said one message, written by a woman who identified herself as
Patricia Heil. ``They have involved you in false advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   The flashing advertisement, about 1 inch high and 3 inches wide,
shows the Jews for Jesus logo, with the Star of David replacing the
``o'' in the word ``for.''
</P>
<P>
   It reads: ``The end of the world is no time to finally realize
Jesus is the Messiah. (It's all in the book.) Click for free
copy!''
</P>
<P>
   When users click on the advertisement, a Web page appears from
the Jews for Jesus site, with an order form for the book. The page
also included a reference to Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, Lycos executives pulled the ad on July 30,
arguing that it gave the appearance that the company endorsed Jews
for Jesus, Snider said. Within days, the reference was removed from
the page and the ad reappeared a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Though Lycos is legally obliged to carry out the contract, the
company does not have to renew it, Snider said.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Kolb, associate director of the Anti-Defamation League's
Boston office, said her group, which fights anti-Semitism, is a
strong proponent of the First Amendment. But, she said, ``Jews
can't be for Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her group urged Lycos to discontinue the ad because she
believes the message is misleading _ and blasphemous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very seductive material for a lot of Jews,'' Kolb said.
``If I'm a Jew struggling with my identity living in this Christian
society, I could believe in Jesus, then I could have Christmas and
I wouldn't have to be different from everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of cozy, but it's offering people an option that
isn't available, and that's what we have a problem with.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, talk show host Joan Rivers, who is Jewish, lashed
out at the group on the air after they advertised the book ``Future
Hope'' during her show.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Hassan, an authority on cults and brainwashing, said
that though he does not like the message of Jews for Jesus, he has
found no evidence that the group is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're essentially Baptists who are putting up money to
recruit Jews, saying you can be a Jew and a Christian
simultaneously,'' said Hassan, who runs the Resource Center for
Freedom of Mind, in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Perlman insisted that Jews can legitimately believe in
Jesus, calling her group ``a small minority of a minority.'' She
said that Jews should be free to decide for themselves what they
want to read and analyze.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that there are people who want to block our
message and prevent people from thinking for themselves,'' Perlman
said. ``The Web is supposed to be a marketplace for all kinds of
ideas, and people can click on them or pass them by.''

CONTROVERSIAL HOUSING ACTIVIST SEALS $3B LOAN DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rebel of affordable housing has done it again.
</P>
<P>
   In a watershed deal that transforms his radical low-income
mortgage program into a national model, self-styled Boston housing
guerrilla Bruce Marks sealed a deal Tuesday for the nation's
largest bank to funnel $3 billion in loans through his
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Under the arrangement, Bank of America will channel the funds
through Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of America, a nonprofit group
that has put thousands of low-income and minority buyers in homes
but drawn criticism for its easy-credit policies.
</P>
<P>
   The eye-opening accord with the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank is
the single largest affordable home loan program ever, and has major
implications for the nation's low-income housing market.
</P>
<P>
   For Marks, an in-your-face activist under new attacks from
skeptics, the 10-year arrangement is nothing short of a coup. The
deal may spur other banks, notably Fleet Financial Group, to
rethink doubts about working with NACA in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found NACA able to produce incredible results,'' said
Bank of America's community development director, Cathy Bessant, in
a statement. She was referring to the bank's first exposure to NACA
through a $500 million loan program launched four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In dramatically expanding the reach of its no-downpayment loan
philosophy, NACA's newest deal underscores a striking
transformation in how banks view high-risk borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   It is a change that is intimately part of NACA's history.
</P>
<P>
   In a decade, NACA has gone from an obscure community group to
the nation's biggest housing services outfit. Created by Marks in
1988 as a housing trust fund for Boston hotel workers, NACA now has
more than 20 offices in 17 states. Known for wringing deals out of
banks after slamming their lending practices, NACA now has banks
knocking at its door.
</P>
<P>
   NACA disburses money provided by banks and other financial
companies to low-income, inner-city and minority home loan
borrowers. Under Tuesday's deal, Bank of America will channel
30,000 no-downpayment mortgages through NACA to borrowers across
the country. NACA has already funneled 5,000 affordable mortgages
through similar arrangements with other banks.
</P>
<P>
   NACA is unique in that it requires little or no downpayment, no
closing costs, and no application fee from borrowers. It accepts
poor or no credit history and counsels applicants on budgets and
the buying process. In doing so, it has challenged the strict
credit requirements and rigid appliction procedures of traditional
lenders.
</P>
<P>
   NACA also charges affordable interest rates _ with Bank of
America, 7.5 percent a year. Most high-risk borrowers have been
limited to nonbank lenders charging rates nearly twice as much _ a
feature Marks says locks poor borrowers out of the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   Far from everyone has praise for NACA and its feisty leader, a
former Federal Reserve staffer and an ex-union activist who grew up
in upper-middle class community of Scarsdale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Some housing activists argue that Marks encourages borrowers to
take on more than they can handle. High-risk borrowers not used to
making monthly mortgage payments can fall behind schedule or
default outright. By spurring foreclosures that destabilize urban
neighborhoods, skeptics argue, no-downpayment loans subvert Marks'
goal of creating stable communities
</P>
<P>
   John Anderson, a real estate analyst and housing activist in
Boston's Dorchester neighborhood, received his mortgage from NACA
but questions the nonprofit's ability to do substantial good.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask _ when is the medicine worse than the cure?''
Anderson said, referring to partial data that he says indicates
high foreclosure rates in neighborhoods like Dorchester, Roxbury,
and Mattapan, where NACA has programs with Fleet and BankBoston.
The worry, Anderson said, is that once the booming economy slows
down, high-risk borrowers could be left without jobs and fail to
make mortgage payments, resulting in a wave of NACA foreclosures.
</P>
<P>
   Another Marks critic, Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas,
recently labeled Marks an extortionist. Gramm, chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee, wants to scale back the Community
Reinvestment Act _ the 1977 federal law that requires banks to lend
to the poorer areas they serve.
</P>
<P>
   The CRA law gives banks credit for making affordable loans _ but
does not track the loans' foreclosure and delinquency rates.
</P>
<P>
   That, said Anderson, is one reason why some banks are now
running to Marks. ``The banks just want to generate the volume,''
Anderson said, faulting industry regulators for not scrutinizing
banks' low-income lending records.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the hard-knuckled activist, Marks, 44, deflected the
criticism. Calling Gramm ``the best thing to happen to NACA since
Terry Murray''_ the Fleet chief executive that Marks hounded
earlier this decade over allegedly usurious lending practices _
Marks vowed to expand his fight against ``predatory lenders.'' (He
no longer counts Fleet in that group.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Confrontational tactics are standard operating procedure for
NACA, and they will only get stronger,'' said Marks, who recently
launched a national television campaign against Gramm.
</P>
<P>
   NACA refuses to provide delinquency rates _ a standard barometer
of a success _ for its programs. ``They aren't relevent,'' Marks
said, adding that ``99.75 percent'' of NACA clients are ``in their
homes and making payments'' _ late or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   A bank executive said Tuesday that industry officials believe
NACA's deliquency rates top 10 percent _ above the 7 percent Fleet
sees for its non-NACA housing loans, and far above the 2 to 3
percent common for traditional loans.
</P>
<P>
   Marks is not alone in refusing to provide data on a program that
now has a national scope.
</P>
<P>
   Housing activists like Dorchester's Ada Focer complained that
Fleet and BankBoston, along with community groups like the
Association for Community Reform Now, or ACORN, and the
Massachusetts Affordable Housing Alliance, also refuse to disclose
deliquency and foreclosure rates. ``If these programs are good,
then they should prove it,'' Focer said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Bank of America was concerned about measuring
NACA's success, a company spokeswoman, Lisa Lester, said, ``We just
know that we like what we've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   NACA prides itself on offering counseling and advice to
borrowers, rather than throwing money at them and leaving them to
sink or swim. In a world of second mortgage scams and predatory
lenders, Marks said, the advice is invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   But the nonprofit has unusual conditions for applicants.
</P>
<P>
   It requires borrowers to contribute $50 a month to a
``stabilization fund.'' Those unable to make monthly mortgage
payments can tap into the pool _ a practice that keeps many
borrowers from confronting their financial problems, Focer said.
</P>
<P>
   NACA also requires borrowers to participate in five ``community
activities'' a year _ code for protests and rallies. At a recent
public hearing for Fleet's proposed acquisition of BankBoston,
hundreds of NACA troops stormed the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston,
wearing yellow T-shirts that read ``Stop the Loan Sharks!''
</P>
<P>
   Marks and supporters once showed up uninvited to a Harvard
business breakfast hosted by Fleet's Murray to protest Fleet's
allegedly questionable lending practices. Badgered by Marks and
dogged by lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny of its mortgage lending
unit, Fleet signed a watershed deal with NACA in 1994 to disburse
$140 million in affordable housing loans through the group. That
benchmark deal, now expired, launched NACA's mortgage program and
led several other beleaguered banks, including First Union, to seal
similar arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's deal was different. In a reflection of how eager banks
have become to tap the nonprofit's ability to locate low-income and
minority customers, NACA did not have to hound Bank of America into
a deal. ``Bank of America gets it, and they came to us,'' Marks
said. The bank, with 30 million customers, has a $350 billion
community lending plan, the biggest of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   In a unique arrangement, Fleet paid NACA about $3.85 million for
administrative costs. NACA's newest deal will be even heftier _
Bank of America will pay the nonprofit up to $2,000 for every loan
it processes, or up to $60 million for the entire project. Marks
paid himself $72,308 in 1997, the last year for which data was
available.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet said earlier this year that New England's largest bank
would not renew its no-downpayment program with Marks after it
absorbs BankBoston. But Fleet spokesman James Mahoney said Tuesday
that after NACA finishes disbursing $100 million left over from
previous agreements with the banks, Fleet would consider working
with NACA again. ``We'll wait and see,'' Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after he launched his affordable lending program by
holding Fleet's feet to the fire, Marks sees sweet justice in that
prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did our first deal with Fleet, Fleet's attitude was,
`We'll give you just enough rope to hang yourself,' '' Marks said.
``But we just grew. We got bigger, stronger, and meaner.''

BUSINESS TRAVEL: FREQUENT-FLIER MILES; ELECTRONIC CONVENIENCE;
BARGAIN FARES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: Also moving in `t' category) 
(yn) 
 By EDWIN MCDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A week after American Airlines all but eliminated the expiration
date for its frequent-flier miles, United Airlines did much the
same Tuesday. But in a departure from American, United will also
reinstate expired miles from 1998 for members who register and who,
by the end of this year, take either two paid domestic round trips
or one paid international round trip on flights operated by United,
United Shuttle or United Express.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are great moves for frequent fliers,'' said Randy
Petersen, the editor of Inside Flyer magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen said that United and American probably wanted to bring
their frequent-flier programs more in line with those of their
airline code-sharing or alliance partners, whose miles generally do
not expire (Continental Airlines, Northwest Airlines and US
Airways) or expire only after several years of member inactivity
(Delta Air Lines and Trans World Airlines).
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Northwest got a jump on American and United early this
year when, soon after joining an alliance with Continental, it
replaced frequent-flier miles that expire with nonexpiring miles.
</P>
<P>
   Under their new programs, United and American require that
members earn or redeem miles at least every 36 months. But they can
do that by paying for purchases with the airline's affinity credit
card, by making long-distance calls with its telecommunications
partners, by staying at a partner hotel, by renting a car from a
rental partner and so on.
</P>
<P>
   To reinstate 1998 miles on United, however, members must
register and make the specified flights by Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Also under the United program, all miles in a member's account
for 1999 will be valid until Dec. 31, 2002, after which they will
expire unless the member earns or redeems miles between Jan. 1,
2000, and Dec. 31, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Convenience
</P>
<P>
   Airlines may have done little in recent years to enhance
passenger comfort, but they have made substantial improvements in
some other aspects of the air travel experience. For example, code
sharing and alliances, whatever their actual or potential
drawbacks, have made it more convenient for passengers to buy one
ticket for travel on two or more airlines, to check baggage through
to their final, distant destination and to earn free tickets faster
on the partner airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Now another air travel improvement will soon be in the works.
IBM and the International Air Transport Association are scheduled
to announce Wednesday that they plan to develop a service linking
the electronic ticketing systems of their 266-member airlines and
other interested carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The service is expected to begin in the middle of next year and
allow passengers to buy an electronic ticket on one carrier that
will also be valid for other carriers' connecting flights.
</P>
<P>
   Bargain Fares
</P>
<P>
   Friday the 13th is a lucky day for bargain hunters. Most
airlines have extended until this Friday their sale fares valid for
travel this fall and winter. These are the fares that include an
additional 10 percent discount if purchased through an airline's
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Friday is also the last day to purchase discount flights on
Japan Airlines for travel beginning by Sept. 20 and ending no later
than Dec. 16. For example, round-trip fares start at $648 for
travel between Los Angeles or San Francisco and Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia; $945 between Chicago and Beijing; $748 between New York
and Taipei, Taiwan, and $798 between Las Vegas, Nev., and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Air New Zealand is offering more than 25 percent off round-trip
fares this fall from New York, Chicago and Los Angeles to New
Zealand for tickets purchased by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Those who buy tickets by Aug. 31 can fly round trip on Korean
Air Lines to Hong Kong or Beijing from the West Coast from $600, or
from New York, Chicago, Dallas and other cities from $700. Flights
to Bangkok and Singapore start at $620. Travel must be completed by
Sept. 30.

SNAFUS AT TEXAS AGENCY THREATEN SERVICES FOR MENTALLY ILL 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A surprising $30 million shortfall in the coming
year's state mental-health budget threatens to slash services by
Sept. 1 for at least 2,000 mentally ill people statewide, officials
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   State auditors are probing the financial woes plaguing the Texas
Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation and might have
answers by Friday to avoid or minimize a cutback in services.
</P>
<P>
   Key legislators and agency officials began scrambling for
solutions this week after widespread protests followed the
mental-health board's Friday vote to cut programs for the mentally
ill to make up for mistakes in budgetary planning.
</P>
<P>
   The board wants to cut $5 million from $27 million in new state
spending for a ``new generation'' of more effective anti-psychotic
drugs. Even more troubling to some legislators, the board also
slashed $7.2 million from current levels of community services for
the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does have some fairly significant implications at the
community level in terms of services that may not be available,''
said Dr. Steven Schnee, executive director of the Harris County
Mental Health Mental Retardation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that 1,700 psychotic individuals statewide
suffering from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression
would not get the new drugs as legislators had intended.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks at Houston mental-health centers could weaken case
management, outpatient counseling, housing, employment services and
other supports that help stabilize the mentally ill, said Spencer
McClure, executive director of the Texas Council of Community MHMR
Centers Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 19,000 mentally ill people receive services from the
Harris County community center along with about 3,500 mentally
retarded individuals, according to the state MHMR agency. Harris
County includes most of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many will be affected statewide and locally by cuts
to the community centers is unclear, but estimates easily exceed
2,000, considering the impact on the drug treatments alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's adult mental-health services that are particularly being
reduced,'' McClure said. ``Without these services and support they
(the mentally ill) would end up either in the streets, the jails or
back in the state institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Also among the scheduled cuts are $2.3 million in services for
those receiving the new drug therapies; a $2.4 million reduction in
state hospital beds, reducing the number by 60; and more than $4
million in administrative spending and information technology
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The problems would presumably be repeated in the fiscal year
2001 as well, meaning that the total shortfall for the two-year
funding cycle could reach $60 million, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Key legislators, frustrated that the agency did not reveal the
funding problem last spring when lawmakers could have fixed it,
asked the agency not to make any cuts while a solution is explored.
MHMR Commissioner Karen Hale said plans for the cuts are in effect
but ``on pause'' for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that it would change. I hope that the funding would go
back into the community centers and in the new generations drugs
and services,'' said Lynn Lasky, public policy director for the
National Alliance for the Mentally Ill of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Lasky added that it is particularly ironic for the agency to cut
funding from the new drug program, which includes support services
for the patients receiving them, since it originally asked for more
than twice that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got about half of what they asked for, and now they're
saying we can do this for less,'' she said. ``When you come back to
the next session how do you knock on the door again and say we need
more money?''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Rep. Rob Junell of San Angelo, chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, said the audit will be key in
understanding the funding problem _ when it developed, why it
wasn't reported and what to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's money they are in the hole, money they
have to pay back for this fiscal year, bills they've got now,''
Junell said. ``If they really went and spent money they're not
going to have, we don't know it, and I'm not sure they know.''
</P>
<P>
   Junell said he doubts Commissioner Hale knew the full extent of
the problem, which she now attributes to a smaller surplus in
federal funds to carry over from previous years and fewer federally
insured Medicaid and Medicare patients at state hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's because they didn't have a clue. That's better
than they intentionally withheld the information. You don't get $60
million behind in just a few months,'' Junell said.
</P>
<P>
   Hale said Tuesday that the agency became aware of the full
extent of the shortfall by the session's end but simply failed to
communicate the problem effectively to legislators. She and the
agency's chief financial officer, Bill Campbell, who came on board
in April, contend that legislators were aware the agency was
expecting $15 million less in surplus money from federal accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Junell said, the current estimated shortfall for the next
two years is four times that. He said committee members thought
that problem had been solved by allowing for an emergency
appropriation if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did everything we could first to try to close the gap
without affecting services,'' Campbell said. ``Then we got down to
the really hard decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   He said cuts to the community centers represent a 3.2 percent
reduction in services statewide, but plans to allow the centers
flexibility in the use of their money might help.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston, a legislative champion of the
mentally ill, said the budget snafu is particularly troubling
because the state of Texas has never come close to meeting the
critical needs of the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I'm real concerned is we don't make a lot of
progress in this area,'' he said. ``When the Legislature has no
confidence in the agency, that hurts programs that the agency is
carrying out.''

LYCOS WON'T RENEW JEWS FOR JESUS AD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SARA NEUFELD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a case pitting free expression against user protest in the
new world of on-line advertising, Lycos Inc., a major Internet
search engine, will not renew an advertisement placed by Jews for
Jesus, after a flood of complaints from the Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   Jews for Jesus paid $1,700 for a banner to appear at the top of
computer screens of the first 40,000 people who type in the word
``Jewish'' as a search term, said Jews for Jesus spokeswoman Susan
Perlman.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which began in the early 1970s, has about 70,000
followers nationwide who, it says, practice Judaism while believing
that Jesus is the Messiah. The banner that Lycos has run advertises
a book by the group's executive director promoting that ideology.
</P>
<P>
   The contract for the advertisement is scheduled to expire within
a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Controversial advertising is bad for business,'' said Jeffrey
Snider, general counsel for Lycos. He said the decision not to
renew had nothing to do with the content of the advertisement, but
emphasized that the company does not want Jews to boycott Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Perlman said Tuesday she had not been informed of Lycos's
decision, and argued that the Internet, by its nature, is a forum
to express a variety of viewpoints and therefore is inherently
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may as well find another planet to operate from if they
don't want controversy,'' she said. ``We're saddened that they have
succumbed to pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Jews for Jesus, which typically has spread its message through
fliers and leaflets, placed the advertisement through a sales
representative in Lycos's San Francisco office, Snider said. To
reach a targeted audience, customers pay Lycos to link their ads
with search terms.
</P>
<P>
   Perlman said Jews for Jesus chose to have its name attached to
the search term ``Jewish'' under the assumption that many Jews
would see it.
</P>
<P>
   They were right.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ad started running July 6, executives at Lycos's
national headquarters in Waltham, Mass. said they were not aware of
it until they received several angry e-mail messages from Jews
beginning on July 29. The company would not discuss the content of
the messages or say how many it received.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are not Jews and are ignorant about Judiasm,''
said one message, written by a woman who identified herself as
Patricia Heil. ``They have involved you in false advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   The flashing advertisement, about 1 inch high and 3 inches wide,
shows the Jews for Jesus logo, with the Star of David replacing the
``o'' in the word ``for.''
</P>
<P>
   It reads: ``The end of the world is no time to finally realize
Jesus is the Messiah. (It's all in the book.) Click for free
copy!''
</P>
<P>
   When users click on the advertisement, a Web page appears from
the Jews for Jesus site, with an order form for the book. The page
also included a reference to Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, Lycos executives pulled the ad on July 30,
arguing that it gave the appearance that the company endorsed Jews
for Jesus, Snider said. Within days, the reference was removed from
the page and the ad reappeared a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Though Lycos is legally obliged to carry out the contract, the
company does not have to renew it, Snider said.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Kolb, associate director of the Anti-Defamation League's
Boston office, said her group, which fights anti-Semitism, is a
strong proponent of the First Amendment. But, she said, ``Jews
can't be for Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her group urged Lycos to discontinue the ad because she
believes the message is misleading _ and blasphemous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very seductive material for a lot of Jews,'' Kolb said.
``If I'm a Jew struggling with my identity living in this Christian
society, I could believe in Jesus, then I could have Christmas and
I wouldn't have to be different from everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of cozy, but it's offering people an option that
isn't available, and that's what we have a problem with.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, talk show host Joan Rivers, who is Jewish, lashed
out at the group on the air after they advertised the book ``Future
Hope'' during her show.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Hassan, an authority on cults and brainwashing, said
that though he does not like the message of Jews for Jesus, he has
found no evidence that the group is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're essentially Baptists who are putting up money to
recruit Jews, saying you can be a Jew and a Christian
simultaneously,'' said Hassan, who runs the Resource Center for
Freedom of Mind, in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Perlman insisted that Jews can legitimately believe in
Jesus, calling her group ``a small minority of a minority.'' She
said that Jews should be free to decide for themselves what they
want to read and analyze.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that there are people who want to block our
message and prevent people from thinking for themselves,'' Perlman
said. ``The Web is supposed to be a marketplace for all kinds of
ideas, and people can click on them or pass them by.''

 &HT;    Paxson looking to take on partner, CEO says
 &HT;    By Stephanie Smith
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Paxson Communications is interested in
finding a partner, not selling off stations, company Chief
Executive Jeff Sagansky said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson Communications' plans have been the subject of
speculation since a federal ruling last week that allows
broadcasters to own two stations in the same large market. The
Federal Communications Commission decision also allows the company
to sell as much as 32.5 percent of its stock to a TV network.
</P>
<P>
   The company has hired Salomon Smith Barney to explore its
options.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear that (Chairman Lowell ``Bud'' Paxson) is
looking to do a number of deals,'' said Christopher Dixon, an
analyst with PaineWebber in New York. ``He can basically sell off a
number of stations and use the cash to buy programming or enter a
joint venture with CBS or another one of the networks that could
provide content.''
</P>
<P>
   Sagansky ruled out selling any of its large-market stations,
though some small-market stations might be sold.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that West Palm Beach-based Paxson Communications
has been looking for a financial alliance. The company has
established itself, but could use a financial boost, Sagansky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would help us to get a bigger company behind us,'' Sagansky
said. ``If we find a strategic partner, they would inject money and
probably other kinds of expertise. It would help us continue the
way we are going, but get there faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Roness, an analyst with JWGenesis Capital Markets in Boca
Raton, said he doubts an alliance with a network will mean Paxson
will veer from its format.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Bud Paxson has his foot in it, it has to have a
certain type of programming,'' said Roness. ``Second, if it's a
national network, what would be the point of having the same
programming on two channels.''
</P>
<P>
   Content has been a problem for Pax TV. It has been struggling to
find an audience for its family-friendly fare, often attracting
less than 1 million of the 100 million households with television
sets.
</P>
<P>
   The network has scheduled more original programs this fall, but
past offerings consisted mostly of network reruns. Some of its
highest rated shows have been repeats of ``Bonanza.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts struggled to put a price on what a buyer would have to
pay for 32.5 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Cheen, an analyst at First Union Capital Markets in
Charlotte, N.C., said the Paxson network was worth $2.5 billion
before the federal rule change. Sagansky said he estimates the
ruling has made the company worth as much as 25 percent more.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Paxson Communications (Amex: PAX) finished at $15.75
Tuesday, up 63 cents on the day. The company now has a market
capitalization of more than $963 million.Stephanie Smith writes for
the Palm Beach Post, West Palm Beach, Fla.

<P>
   I spent the day with two blond icons, women whose faces and
first names are instantly recognizable around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Both paired off in rocky romances with sex-addled young
presidents. And both were painted variously as vulnerable and
stubborn, accomplished and self-defeating, smart and dumb. Misfits,
both, neither quite believable as a Yankees fan or a wannabe Jewish
girl.
</P>
<P>
   One is Camelot, the other Castle Grande. One is Cecil Beaton;
the other Kaki Hockersmith. One is champagne, the other tea and
cookies. One is marabou, the other Miramax.
</P>
<P>
   One is most famous for standing on a New York subway grate in a
billowing white pleated dress; the other is still trying to get her
New York subway lines straight. One lost a famous husband because
she refused to duck into his shadow; the other keeps her famous
husband even as she tries to bolt from his shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary in Queens. Marilyn at Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrity-drenched culture that dawned in the glamorous aura
of Marilyn Monroe, JFK and Jackie has now reached nauseating new
depths. We're always wallowing in celebrity lifestyle and
deathstyle.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of her therapy session with Talk magazine, Hillary
Rodham Clinton was trying to shift back to listening. At a union
hall in Queens Tuesday morning, she expressed her ``concern'' about
the problem of too much money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I'm out there raising money, I'm a zealot about
campaign finance reform,'' she told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Could this be the same Hillary who helped turn the White House
into a pajama party for fat-cat donors? Is this the same political
right hand who urged the return of Dick Morris, the man who fueled
the obscene money race in '96 with phony issue ads?
</P>
<P>
   It's jarring to hear the would-be senator offer beliefs that
ignore the reality of the last eight years of aiding and abetting
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's bid is still rooted in her status as celebrity
and victim. That's a cocktail that Marilyn would have understood
perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   The display of Marilyn's personal property that will be
auctioned by Christie's in October is much like Hillary's Talk
interview _ invasive and inviting at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hillary, Marilyn's troubles are what keep her so
compelling. As the actress said in ``Some Like It Hot,'' she always
got stuck with the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
</P>
<P>
   The Christie's galleries were chock-a-block with Ferragamo
stilettos, Maximillian furs, Pucci silks, Norell beaded gowns, lace
bustiers, see-through nighties and marabou capelets and mules.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Marilyn stuff, bequeathed by the star to her acting
teacher, Lee Strasberg, and sold by his widow, Anna, is glamorous.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the gilt lighters from Frank Sinatra's Cal-Neva Lodge,
the gold sandals she wore to entertain the troops in Korea, and the
dog license of the small white pooch the singer gave her. Here are
her scripts with penciled notes to herself, like the scene in
``Some Like It Hot'' when she tells herself to act ``delighted''
when she gets on the yacht with Tony Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   Her ambitious library gets its own room _ Thomas Mann, D.H.
Lawrence, Tennessee Williams, Colette, a first edition of Kerouac's
``On the Road,'' a book on mixing cocktails signed by Dean Martin,
who wrote the introduction, the works of Freud. Stuck inside her
copy of ``The Joy of Cooking'' is a typed diet starting at 8 a.m.
with stewed prunes and ending at 11 p.m. with eggnog.
</P>
<P>
   The ``nudest dress,'' as the designer Jean Louis called it _
that skin-tight, flesh-tone, rhinestone-dotted gown that Marilyn
wore to sing ``Happy Birthday'' to JFK _ is reverently displayed in
a room by itself, lit from above as though it were the Pieta or the
David.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wore no undergarments,'' said an awestruck matron with a
heavy Queens accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost $12,000!'' her friend chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   But a B-flat mood prevailed. Marilyn's Mexican sombreros, her
certificate of conversion to Judaism when she married Arthur
Miller, her platinum-and-diamond ``eternity band'' from Joe
DiMaggio, her heart-shaped cookie cutters, her poem entitled ``A
Sorry Song'' were sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be alive, they say I'm lucky to be alive,'' she
wrote in pencil, ``it's hard to figure out when everything I feel _
hurts!''

SEC IS EXPECTED TO LIMIT WAYS EARNINGS REPORTS ARE FINESSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Securities and Exchange Commission is expected
to issue accounting rules in the near future that are aimed at
limiting companies' ability to finesse their earnings results.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have been allowed to play down or ignore adjustments
to liabilities, revenues and other accounts as long as the amount
of the problem was insignificant, or in the word used by
accountants ``immaterial.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, the SEC would consider what might have
prompted companies to not make the necessary adjustments to their
financial books. For example, regulators may question the accuracy
of a company's financial statements if executives had dismissed
needed accounting changes after they realized that those
adjustments would cause the company to miss the earnings estimates
of Wall Street analysts or to miss a financial target that would
award lucrative executive bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer from the SEC described the regulators' proposed
guidelines, which are expected to be issued in the coming weeks,
during a panel discussion at the American Bar Association's annual
meeting in Atlanta on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Young, a lawyer at the New York firm of Willkie Farr &AMP;
Gallagher, who also sat on Monday's panel, said the new rules would
prevent companies from automatically dismissing adjustments to the
financial books that were less than 5 percent of earnings. Now,
financial executives and outside auditors often use the 5 percent
limit when they are considering whether adjustments should be made
to the books. If the adjustment is less than 5 percent of earnings,
the auditors often agree that it is not significant, or not
``material.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The SEC is telling the financial community that adherence to
traditional materiality thresholds is not going to be enough,''
Young said. ``They're saying, `Come on, guys, you have to try to
get it right.'''
</P>
<P>
   SEC officials said they could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, securities regulators have repeatedly warned
companies that they should not manage their earnings just to meet
Wall Street's expectations. Regulators have said that the practice
has become almost routine among public companies.
</P>
<P>
   According to Young, other factors that regulators say they will
consider when determining whether companies have incorrectly
dismissed small accounting adjustments include whether the
adjustment would have converted a loss into a profit or whether it
helped conceal an illegal transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules will be issued as a staff accounting bulletin, a
paper that includes the guidelines that commission employees follow
when regulating public companies.
</P>
<P>
   Young said regulators were reacting to the emphasis on earnings
numbers in the stock market Tuesday. Investors often pummel a stock
price when a company misses its expected earnings by just a few
pennies a share. In such a volatile market, Young said, regulators
have decided that even the smallest adjustments to the bottom line
can be important.

   He also must repay Lexington Place Healthcare Center $20,752,
the amount he stole between Oct. 20, 1997, and Oct. 20, 1998, said
prosecutor Terry Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was remorseful, and he was very embarrassed for his son,''
Jennings said after sentencing. ``Obviously, his father's problems
cannot be held against Ricky Williams in any way. If anything, it
shows what he had to overcome to get where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Toby D. Boyer did not return calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings said Errick Williams, who was working as housekeeping
supervisor at the nursing home, created phony documents and
timeslips that showed his wife worked with him. She did not, but
Jennings said Williams collected her checks and cashed them.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence that Williams' wife, Patricia Maria
Williams, was involved, and she was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Williams, Ricky's mother, raised him alone after
divorcing his dad in 1983, raising allegations of child abuse,
according to the May 18 issue of Sports Illustrated. The story also
says Errick Williams denied abusing his children and that he and
his son have become friends in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings said Errick Williams was placed on probation in a
federal court in 1978 in California on a misdemeanor theft charge.
He successfully completed that probation.
</P>
<P>
   If he follows the rules in this case, Ellis will continue to
withhold a finding of guilt and no conviction will be on Errick
Williams' record.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the nation's latest inexplicable act of
violence, a balding, white, middle-aged man walked into a Jewish
community center in a middle-class suburb Tuesday morning and fired
as many as 30 shots, wounding five people, including three young
boys at a day camp, and then fled.
</P>
<P>
   A 3{-year-old boy who said he was just a few feet away from the
shooting _ his mother would only give his name as Eric _ said the
man said nothing before fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad monster ran away,'' said the boy, who clung to his
mother and asked her if any of the wounded children had done
anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   One of the victims, a 8-year-old boy, who had been shot in the
abdomen, was in critical but stable condition after surgery, while
Fire Department officials said the other four were in stable
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Police with dogs cordoned off the area around the North Valley
Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills to search for the suspect,
described as about 40 years old, but by Tuesday evening they had
not found him and believed he was no longer in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they had no idea who he was or why he opened fire
and that none of the people who saw the shooter at the center
recognized him.
</P>
<P>
   Officials asked residents of the neighborhood to remain indoors
as they conducted their search, but police lines quickly became
jammed with parents waiting anxiously to hear about their children.
</P>
<P>
   Within a half-hour after the shooting occurred at 10:45 a.m.,
helicopter crews from local television stations broadcast images of
police officers leading children out of the center by hand, in
strings of five, six and seven. Firefighters and paramedics at the
scene said the children had been orderly, though upset.
</P>
<P>
   The images of fleeing children, anxious parents and armed
officers searching alleys, sheds and homes in the area were
broadcast for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents who were reunited with their children in the street
then stayed in the area, hugging their children, chatting with
friends and other parents, apparently so stunned by the violence
that they seemed unconcerned that the shooter could still be in the
neighborhood. Around midday, the Fire Department brought a cooler
of drinks for parents, many who were still waiting for word on the
whereabouts of their children.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Shalometh Golden was quoted by the City News Service as
saying that her mother, Isabelle Shalometh, a receptionist at the
center, had been wounded lightly in the arm and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said a young man, a ruffian, she saw him coming at her and
I guess he just started open firing,'' Ms. Golden said, ``and she
knew enough to quickly duck down and she did.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire Department Capt. Steve Ruda said that in addition to Ms.
Shalometh, who he said was 65, a 16-year-old girl was shot in the
right thigh and shin, a 6-year-old boy was wounded in the left foot
and another 6-year-old boy was shot in the left leg and hip. The
most seriously sounded was the 8-year-old boy hit in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the shooter was between 5 feet 8 and 5 feet 10,
about 170 pounds, and was dressed in green clothing. He fired as
many as 30 shots from a 9-millimeter handgun, then apparently fled
on foot, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the police said that two young men had been
responsible, but later attributed that description to confusion by
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms sent
agents to the residential area, in the San Fernando Valley about 30
miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, to assist local police.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, the police were sifting through a number of
clues, whose relation remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. Police Cmdr. David Kalish said they had searched a red van
with Washington state license plates, in an area not far from the
shooting and had found ``an incredible amount of ammunition,'' a
bulletproof vest and ``substantial other evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Police also said that about noon there had been a carjacking in
which a white male who generally matched the description of the
shooter had stolen a dark green 1999 Toyota Corolla. The police
later said that the van's driver was the same man who had stolen
the car at gunpoint, and that they had been led to the van while
investigating the car theft. Later, police found the Toyota several
miles away at a hotel that they barricaded and surrounded.
</P>
<P>
   Because the incident followed a string of school shootings in
recent months, and comes in the middle of an intense debate over
the availability of firearms, it was followed closely by officials
across the state and in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said, ``Once again our nation has been shaken
and our hearts torn'' by what he called ``another senseless act of
gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   California Gov. Gray Davis said, ``Once again, we have been
shocked, saddened and outraged by an act of vicious gun violence
aimed against defenseless children and innocent adults.'' He
offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The North Valley Jewish Community Center is an educational and
recreation facility where the elderly come to play cards, parents
drop their toddlers off for pre-school, singles play tennis and
children learned to swim in the pool.
</P>
<P>
   There are after-school enrichment classes on gymnastics, karate,
cooking and celebrating the Sabbath. Children learned to make
traditional braided challah bread and how to celebrate the Jewish
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The ``little red schoolhouse,'' a small facility behind the main
building, houses the pre-school for children aged 2 and 3. The
pre-school's security rules required that parents sign children in
and out each day.
</P>
<P>
   Although the neighborhood is generally quiet, several residents
said there have been growing racial tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Trombley, 18, who graduated last year from the local high
school, said Granada Hills is largely white, with a mix of blue
collar and white collar families. But, he said, it borders on one
side a largely Asian neighborhood, and on another side a Latino
neighborhood, and there have been sporadic racial tensions, with
fights involving teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of life around here,'' he said. ``You just accept
it.''

CRACKDOWN ON HOUSING FOR MIGRANT WORKERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Rewritten 4th graf adds sentence describing crackdown, new
9th graf describes housing standards)   By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WENATCHEE, Wash. _ At the height of cherry-picking season, 12
men were making a patch of woods on Stemilt Hill into a home.
Plastic grocery bags hung from nails in the Ponderosa pine bark:
the pantry. A shard of mirror was wedged into a trunk of another
pine: the bathroom. The kitchen was a Sunbeam propane grill, the
bushes served as toilets, and six cheap tents formed the bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meat we have to buy every day, because it spoils,'' said
Nereo Sanchez, who like the others came from Pachuca, Mexico. Last
year, they stayed in an orchard, but this year the owner will no
longer allow it. They said they had looked for campgrounds, but
found no room. They stayed here on public land, until forest
rangers moved them along.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel bad,'' said his coworker Juan Sanchez. ``When we go
pick, we don't know if our tents will still be here'' at the end of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Of the state's 16,000 cherry pickers, said an adviser to Gov.
Gary Locke, 10,000 have not had adequate housing in the brief but
profitable couple of weeks that the fruit ripens. And in a recent
crackdown, the federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration displaced 2,000 more, said the adviser, Rich
Nafziger, after it threatened to close camps run by fruit growers
that did not meet federal health and safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with fines, many growers stopped letting workers camp in
the orchards.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the state health department created a temporary
licensing program for camps in the orchards with standards which
were supposed to meet federal requirements by next season. Workers
were allowed to stay in tents they bought on their own, which often
leaked and did not provide protection from insects and heat.
Growers had to provide water and toilets but not refrigerators.
Workers used ice-filled coolers to store their food.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hot weather the food ends up floating in water in the ice
chest,'' said Richard Terrill, northwest regional administrator for
the safety and health administration.``You have a lot of people in
close quarters, with the danger of communicable diseases. Some of
the camps didn't have an adequate number of toilets and showers.''
</P>
<P>
   The licensing provisions were intended to give growers an
incentive to supply better, more plentiful shelter for workers, but
they served only to justify the status quo instead of encouraging
growers to meet federal standards, Terrill said.
</P>
<P>
   Those standards include making living quarters at least 7 feet
high, with adequate ventilation and permanent floors to keep out
vermin and moisture. The camps also have to have water and
refrigeration.
</P>
<P>
   With growers showing little progress in meeting the tougher
federal standards, the government stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year when we made our objections known, there were
probably a few farmers who decided they wouldn't even provide what
they had provided before, and that probably meant _ I'll be honest
with you _ that several hundred more workers didn't have a place to
camp, he said. ``And I feel bad about that. I know that pinched
people, but hopefully the outcome will be good, so next year and in
the years after, there will be more housing and better housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Growers are not legally required to provide housing, said Dan
Kelly, assistant manager of the Washington Growers Clearing House
Association, a group of 2,800 tree fruit grower members. Most
growers say they cannot afford to build permanent housing for
pickers during a two-week harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Fox, owner of C&AMP;S Orchard in Wenatchee, had a camp on his
property three years ago, but decided to close it. He employs
between 150 and 600 workers, depending on the size of his harvest
on the arid, irrigated hills above the Columbia River.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was economically feasible, I'd love to have the camp,''
Fox said. But he said meeting licensing standards would cost
$400,000 to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unjustifiable expense,'' he said. ``Talk to any
banker, and a banker will laugh you out of the bank.'' He said
workers are better off in a grower's camp than on the roadside.
``It's safer, better, healthier, for everyone concerned,'' Fox
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Guadalupe Gamboa, the state director for the United
Farmworkers of America, is optimistic that the crackdown will
result in improved conditions.
</P>
<P>
   He said establishing state standards for licensing that were
lower than federal requirements was ``a huge subsidy to the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   If growers want to rely on a migrant work force, he said,
``They've got to find a place for migrants to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Farm worker advocates point out that growers are willing to make
other large investments in a quick crop, like orchard warming
machines that cost $26,000 just to transport, while showers for the
workers are more likely to be considered a luxury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole issue about short seasons kind of bothers me,'' said
Terrill. ``If you're a grower and you grow a short-season crop, you
still invest in chemicals, tractors, and other equipment. I think
that argument is specious.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherry picking requires special timing and skills; the fruit
must be picked just as soon as it is ripe, and workers must be
careful not to separate the stems from the fruit or damage the
branches where next year's buds will form.
</P>
<P>
   Working from 4 a.m. til noon, when heat can damage the fruit,
pickers can make $4 for filling a 40-pound box, or up to $80 a day.
Many travel for weeks at a time following the ripening from
California to Oregon, then from Washington to Montana. Workers say
living conditions in other states are better, with trailers
available in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   A few solutions are being tried in Washington. About 300 people
found shelter this season through the state's Rent-a-Tent program,
which leased 26 six-person tents for $200 per tent a month to 8
growers during the harvest, with the hope that if enough growers
participate statewide, the tents can move with the workers along
the trail of ripening cherries. In Mattawa, a town on the Columbia,
the state has developed the Esperanza migrant center, a village of
temporary shelters created out of shipping containers. Each
8-by-40-foot structure sleeps six and has windows, air conditioning
and a bathroom with shower.
</P>
<P>
   But such accommodations reach only a small percentage of the
work force. Many of the rest made do in the woods outside of town.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Padilla, 36, of Yakima, Wash., was camping with seven
other people, including three of her six children. Their dinner was
frying on a propane stove. They drink untreated water from a nearby
creek and have no access to indoor plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like a house or a cabin so we could wash dishes and
shower,'' she said. She and her husband, Lupe Padilla, 39, figured
they each were making $40 a day, not enough to support their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not very good,'' Padilla said, surveying the four tents
pitched near the road. ``But what can we do?''

WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE KIDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHIL DAVIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ First the gunshots. Now the questions.
</P>
<P>
   What do you say to a wide-eyed child who wants to know why a
grown-up would gun down children at a day camp, a place that's
supposed to be safe and fun?
</P>
<P>
   It's a question parents across America are facing today. And
it's an even more difficult question for suburban San Fernando
Valley parents because this time the bullets hit close to home.
Tuesday's shooting rampage at a day camp at the North Valley Jewish
Community Center in the Granada Hills area of Los Angeles left
three children, a teen-ager and an adult wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Even the experts shudder at the thought of explaining this to
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm almost at a loss,'' said Dr. Leslie Waxman, a child
psychiatrist who works with Kaiser Permanente Medical Centers in
the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no magic word to reassure your child about something
like this. All you can do is explain to kids that there are some
things we don't have explanations for, but we're going to do our
very best to make sure that they're safe and that they're taken
care of.''
</P>
<P>
   As police hunted the gunman, crisis counselors and clergy
converged on area hospitals and the church near the community
center to treat the psychological wounds of the injured, their
families and about 20 other children at the day camp.
</P>
<P>
   But parents and children across the nation continued to be
assaulted with non-stop television images that included a wounded
boy being wheeled to a waiting emergency helicopter and frightened
children being led to safety by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Feinberg, a child psychiatrist at the University of
California, Los Angeles, said children will react differently to
the shooting, but all benefit from talking about it. It's best to
be honest and direct.
</P>
<P>
   Parents must assess just how much their child can understand.
For example, children can't grasp the concept of death _ that it's
universal, inevitable and irreversible _ until they're 9 or 10
years old.
</P>
<P>
   For the younger children, simplify the situation: ``Some people
get really upset and they don't know what to do when they're upset
so they hurt people and that's terrible,'' Feinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Older children can handle more information, and it's a good
chance to use the incident as an opportunity to talk about violence
and death.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, it's also crucial to point out there's nothing
normal about the violence. Children need to feel safe. ``When you
look at the statistics, violence hasn't increased but the media
coverage of it sure has,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And parents should feel comfortable expressing their own
emotions about what happened. ``You can't expect parents to be
superhuman,'' said Waxman. ``I think it's important to be calm, to
try not to be hysterical, but letting your kids know that you're
sad or that something bad has happened is natural and normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts offer these tips to help children cope with violence:
</P>
<P>
   _ Talk about it. Encourage children to say how they feel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sometimes drawing pictures can help a child express feelings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be honest. It's OK to be sad. It's OK not to understand
everything that happens in the world. And it's OK to tell that to
your child.
</P>
<P>
   _ Turn off the television. Experts disagree on this point, but
all agree that it's best to tailor the information kids get to
their level of understanding.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be alert to any changes in your child's everyday behavior.
Some children may need to do more than simply talk about what
happened.

SOME GOP CANDIDATES BECOMING MORE ACCOMMODATING TO GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for political wire)  (bl) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prominent Republican presidential candidates are
creating an atmosphere that is subtly but fundamentally more
inviting to gay and lesbian voters than party leaders have been in
recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Sen. John McCain and Elizabeth Dole _
who combined have the lion's share of support among Republicans in
early polls _ have signaled an openness to gay supporters,
including a willingness to appoint them to positions like
ambassadorships.
</P>
<P>
   The new receptivity toward homosexuality follows a similar
soft-pedaling by leading Republicans on abortion. While they still
oppose abortion and are by no means converts on other gay rights
issues like same-sex marriage, the most prominent candidates are
offering a lower-key, more inclusive approach designed to appeal
beyond the conservative base of the party to independent and
Democratic voters in a general election. It also reflects the
continued growing political influence of gay donors and gay voters
across party lines.
</P>
<P>
   The new message on gay supporters is a far cry from 1996, when
Republican nominee Bob Dole returned a $1,000 donation from the Log
Cabin Republicans, a group of gay party members, and from 1992,
when the dominant voice on the issue from Republicans was that of
Patrick Buchanan, whose declaration of a ``culture war'' was aimed
squarely at homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan and other conservative candidates have not changed
their views, and even Bush, McCain and Mrs. Dole have not embraced
a broader gay agenda that also includes adoptions by gays and a
less punitive approach toward gays in the military. But gay
political leaders say the difference in attitude is striking
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tone has totally changed,'' said Rich Tafel, executive
director of the Log Cabin Republicans. ``What I hear is gay
Republicans enthusiastic about the tone being set by the leading
candidates. It looks like Republicans for the first time are
saying, `This is a community I'm not going to alienate and maybe I
want to reach out to it.' That's kind of a shocking revelation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Democrats, of course, have courted gay voters for years, and
this year both Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley,
the two rivals for the Democratic nomination, are competing for
their support. Both campaigns have fund-raisers working expressly
with gay donors, who tend to be generous financially and active
politically.
</P>
<P>
   So intense is the Gore-Bradley rivalry for gay support that the
two candidates even appeared recently at the same gay and lesbian
community center in Los Angeles within a week of each other.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, though, this rapprochement is new. Bush,
so far the run-away favorite in the Republican field, has said he
would have no qualms about hiring gays. ``If someone can do a job,
and a job that he's qualified for, that person ought to be allowed
to do his job,'' he said earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has appointed Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona, the only
openly gay Republican in the House, to his national steering
committee, has similarly said he would hire on merit alone. He has
supported anti-hate-crimes legislation that would protect victims
of crime not only because of their race but their ``sexual
orientation.'' He has said that someday he could envision a gay
president.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole has said she would appoint to her administration
anyone who was qualified, emphasizing in an NBC interview in July
that ``all people are welcome'' and adding: ``I'm inclusive.'' Of
the contribution that her husband spurned in 1996, Mrs. Dole said
that if she received a check from the same group, ``I would not
turn it away.''
</P>
<P>
   William Kristol, who was chief of staff to Vice President Dan
Quayle and now is editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, said
that the mainstream Republican candidates this year were clearly
unhappy under the banner of strident, anti-gay language.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican establishment does not want to fight the
conservative culture war,'' Kristol said, ``partly because they
think it's a losing fight, but more importantly, they don't believe
in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the party establishment, Buchanan and other
conservatives remain adamant. His spokesman, Bob Adams, said
Buchanan ``has certainly not abandoned the culture war.'' Some,
like Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes, make their rejection of
homosexuality a major plank of their platforms. Bauer said recently
that when he heard McCain say the party should be ``a big tent that
admits everybody,'' the phrase sounded to him ``like fingernails on
a chalkboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the wealthy publisher and candidate, flatly
opposes any concessions to gay voters. He frequently says he wants
``equal rights for all, special rights for none.'' Asked if Forbes
would appoint an openly gay person to his administration, his
campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, said: ``If the person is qualified
for the job, that's fine as long as it is not a statement on a life
style or promoting a life style.'' As for gay adoptions, Dal Col
said: ``There are plenty of heterosexual couples out there,'' and
existing laws against hate crimes are enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Louis Sheldon, a staunch conservative who heads a
national group called the Traditional Values Coalition and who has
denounced homosexuals often in his career, denied that there was a
trend among Republicans to reach out to gay voters.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the Republican presidential candidates oppose
homosexuals in the military and same-sex marriages, Sheldon said
that ``there aren't that many Log Cabin voters out there.'' He
added: ``There is nothing immutable about sexual behavior _ it is
chosen.''

 &HT;    Andruw Jones: King of the wall
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the typewritten play-by-play that the Braves hand
out in the press box after every game, it wasn't even highlighted
as The Catch. ``Astros 3rd,'' the fifth paragraph reads, ``Biggio
singled to center. Spiers flied out to AJones.''
</P>
<P>
   But a day after Andruw Jones updated his personal highlight film
with an over-the-shoulder, leaping, cleats-in-the-outfield-padding
catch of Bill Spiers' drive to center field, Atlanta was still
abuzz.
</P>
<P>
   It was still the talk of Turner Field, where fans bowed to Jones
Monday night as if royalty were returning to the home dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best catch I've ever seen,'' Spiers said. He wouldn't go
as far as to say he was robbed of an extra-base hit. ``No, I
expected him to make it. He makes a lot of good plays. He has a
chance to be as good a center fielder ever in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many times we've seen Andruw top his previous
catch,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said, ``but this time I think
he's done it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Otis Nixon, whose historic leap against the Pirates
in 1992 had been the most famous catch in recent Braves history
until Jones showed up, had a flashback watching Jones Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminded me of that, but he's been doing it all season,''
Nixon said. ``That's probably one of the best he's made since I've
been here. The others? Where do you want me to start, the one over
in the gap, the one over there, which one? He's been making quite a
few this season. He's the best center fielder in the game right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he would rank the catch up there among his three
best. The others: 1998, against Steve Finley of San Diego, and one
this year, he doesn't recall against whom, when he hit his head on
the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finley hit the ball off (Tom) Glavine and I made the catch on
a similar play,'' Jones said. ``Those are two that I hang on the
wall. You're off balance, you're in the air and you're catching a
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   He was proud of his effort Monday night, mainly because the
Astros did not score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a great catch, especially to save a run,''
Jones said. ``If the ball hit the wall and I didn't try to jump on
the wall, I think Craig Biggio could have scored. Most of the
catches that I think are good are when I save a run, that's what I
think is a great catch. When there's nobody on base and you make a
good catch, it's just a good catch. For me, it's great when you
keep a run from scoring or throw somebody out at home plate. Those
are the good plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday's game against Houston, Jones went out to the
center field wall to inspect his cleat marks in the padding. He
knows the sacrifice he makes when he goes after a ball at the wall.
He knows what it's going to feel like the morning after.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to hurt the back of your ankles and most of the
time you hurt your knee, too,'' Jones said. ``I feel those pains,
but sometimes I just tell myself don't put it in your mind. Just
leave it there. If you don't jump right you can get stuck (in the
padding) and hurt yourself. You never know what's going to happen
when you do stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the men who play with Jones and against him have a pretty
good idea. They recognize his speed, that he plays shallow because
he can chase down balls. The most common word heard at Turner
Tuesday about Andruw Jones was ``incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Truthfully, he's in a defensive class by himself,'' said Carl
Everett, the Astros center fielder. ``I don't see any outfielder
that can actually do what he does. Of all the centerfielders in
baseball, no one would have caught it except him. He has great
wheels and great instincts. But he throws people out because he
takes those chances of playing in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect him to make those plays now,'' said left fielder
Ryan Klesko. ``He makes diving catches and plays that most
centerfielders would never get to. He's awesome, he gets a good
read on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was weak,'' right fielder Brian Jordan said, teasingly.
``Honestly, this guy is amazing. He puts it out there on the line,
he doesn't worry about injury. He makes one great play after
another. He's still learning the game. He's just playing on raw
talent right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Keven McGlintchy saw Jones' play from the bullpen
Monday night and watched in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how in the world he caught that ball,''
McGlintchy said. ``His concentration is amazing. He's just
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Jones is a pitcher's best insurance policy. ``It's good
to know that if we make a bad pitch and they hit it in the gaps,
there's always a chance Andruw will make a nice play,'' McGlintchy
said. ``To him it looks very easy.''

 WASHINGTON: is chosen.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Still, anti-gay sentiment is less strident this year. Many
Republicans avoid the matter entirely. Brian Kennedy, the national
political director for former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, said:
``He neither brings up those issues in his stump speech nor do we
ever recall him being asked about it. It doesn't seem to be on the
radar screen for the '99 cycle.'' Adams, Buchanan's spokesman,
agreed. ``It hasn't come up, and we haven't been making it an
issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Quayle, a social conservative who has aggressively promoted
``family values,'' has shown moderation toward homosexuals. Asked
on a radio program last month what he would do if one of his
children were homosexual, he said he would support them ``whatever
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   While he avoided answering specific questions about gays in the
military and gay adoptions, Quayle also said: ``Life-style
orientation really makes no difference to me at all. Believe me, I
don't inquire what one's sexual preference may or may not be.'' He
repeated his view that homosexuality is a choice but did not say,
as he did in 1992, that it was ``a wrong choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristol said that most Republicans were still being careful in
their statements because they did not want to alienate the
grass-roots conservatives who believe homosexuality is a sin. But
the candidates' tempered tone, he said, poses a dilemma for
conservative voters. ``The question is, do conservatives want to
win so badly that they will accept this kind of establishment
leadership?'' he asked. ``Or have they, too, given up on the
culture war? Do they want a political champion for their views?''
</P>
<P>
   Since gays emerged several years ago as a significant voting
bloc, Republicans ceded them to the Democrats. About 5 percent of
voters in 1996 identified themselves in polls of people leaving
voting booths as gay _ ``about the same percentage as Hispanics and
larger than the Jewish vote,'' said Elizabeth Birch, executive
director of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and
lesbian lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   Tafel, who is organizing gay Republican voters this week to
participate in the Iowa straw poll and is seeking a slot for an
openly gay speaker at the Republican national convention next year,
said that the party was finally recognizing the influence of the
gay electorate. ``It's the first time we haven't been take for
granted'' as likely Democrats, he said. His group has yet to make
an endorsement or give any money to any of the presidential
candidates, but it plans to do so closer to next year's convention.
</P>
<P>
   Also making the gay vote more available to Republicans this year
is the fact that liberal Democrats have not been entirely happy
with the Clinton administration's record on gay issues. They have
complained of a lack of financing for the treatment of AIDS, the
opposition to gay marriage and the murky ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy that has allowed a record number of anti-gay discharges from
the military. Such discharges increased 86 percent over the last
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Alert to the potential appeal of Republicans who refrain from
broad cultural attacks, Democrats are warning that the Republicans
are not as tolerant as they may appear. Pat Ewing, a senior adviser
at the Democratic National Committee, said of Bush: ``He is
purposefully vague, not moderate. Bush denied Texans protection
from hate crimes and let it be known that he opposed any provision
to protect gays and lesbians from these crimes. His platitudes are
meant to obscure.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, a spokeswoman for Bush, said he objected to the
hate-crimes legislation because ``all violent crime is motivated by
hate'' and Texas already has a law that covers such crimes. But,
she said, he also did not believe that sexual orientation should be
singled out for special rights. ``He doesn't believe in granting
legal rights based on sexual orientation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has made an extra effort to appeal to homosexuals. In one
of his rare departures from Clinton orthodoxy, he has called for a
more ``compassionate'' _ though unspecific _ approach to
homosexuals in the military.
</P>
<P>
   In California, which is likely to face a ballot initiative next
year that outlaws same-sex marriage, Gore said he favored legal
protections for same-sex partners, like health benefits and
hospital visitation rights, but he opposed ``a change in the
institution of marriage as we now know it between men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   He would leave gay adoptions up to adoption professionals on an
individual basis, his spokesman, Chris Lahane, said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats acknowledge that Gore and Bradley have virtually
identical records on gay issues. Eric Hauser, a spokesman for
Bradley, said he supported a ``review'' of the ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy on gays in the military. He also supports gay
adoptions and extending legal rights, including health benefits and
hospital visitation, to same-sex partners as ``common sense''
measures.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley was in the Senate, he voted for the so-called
defense of marriage act, which said no state had to recognize the
same-sex laws of another state. Likewise, President Clinton signed
the bill into law, and Gore ``stood beside him'' in supporting it,
Ms. Birch said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore has been outspoken in favor of gay issues, he has
also been the target of gay demonstrators. AIDS activists have
cropped up, noisily, at several of his campaign events, accusing
him of siding with drug companies and trying to block South
Africa's access to cheaper generic drugs to fight HIV. His staff
says this is an international patent issue and is trying to work it
out.

 &HT;    NASCAR ousts crew pair for racial incident
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ NASCAR's image was tarnished Tuesday from a month-old
incident that resulted in the governing body suspending two white
race-team members for their part in a racial harassment incident in
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Two crew members knocked on the door of the motorcoach and one
put a pillowcase over his head in an apparent effort to mimic the
Ku Klux Klan in a prank on David Scott, a black crew member with
Jeremy Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two, Mike Culberson, was fired by Winston Cup driver
Derrike Cope. The other, Ray Labbe, was fired by Cup driver Terry
Labonte. Both were terminated within days of the July 8 incident
during practice sessions at the Jiffy Lube 300 in Loudon, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Both were motorcoach drivers, who transport the race cars to
tracks. Labbe also was a crew member for Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's added its ``indefinite suspension'' on Tuesday after
investigating the matter for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their actions were deplorable and will not be tolerated,''
said Kevin Triplett, NASCAR's director of operations. ``We have
zero tolerance for any harassment, whether it's gender, race or
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's actions haven't stopped the concerns of minorities, who
have contended that the organization is racist. The critics point
to limited representation and opportunities in the sport for
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has kept miniorities out of motor sports is actual racism
and perceived racism,'' said Charles Farrell, spokesman for the
Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. ``This incident supports the perceived
racism. Yet, we're very glad NASCAR took the steps to suspend the
two men. There's no room for this type of thing if NASCAR is
serious about bringing blacks into the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Cope and Labonte, two of the sport's top drivers, seemed
embarrassed by the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behavior like this simply cannot be tolerated in today's
society,'' Cope said. ``This is an example of a grievous behavior
that I do not condone. It was an ignorant act, and I took the only
course available to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte, brother of Terry, said during a Tuesday stop in
Atlanta that he was concerned about his brother and the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothered Terry; he was very, very upset and torn up about
it,'' Bobby Labonte said. ``It embarrassed him and put him in a bad
situation. It put me in a bad situation, too, because I'm his
brother and people are asking me about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Driver, who drives in the Modified Series and is the first
African-American to finish in the top five of a NASCAR touring
series, said he thinks it was a isolated incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR is already in a situation where they have been getting
beat up for a while here now on the issue of trying to get
minorities to come into the sport,'' Driver said. ``It can put a
dampening on things. You have to oversee two clowns like this and
just look at the positive and end it here, because NASCAR took care
of it immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope the sport isn't held accountable for the actions
of two individuals,'' NASCAR's Triplett said. ``When you have a
town of 60,000 people, you have a couple of individuals who make
gross errors. Is the town held accountable? It's similar to this
situation, with this organization involving 60,000 people.''

   UPS LOSES TAX RULING THAT COULD COST IT MILLIONS
</P>
<P>
   A judge has ruled that United Parcel Service took inflated
deductions in 1984 and must pay taxes, penalties and interest that
the company said might total nearly $300 million. Its ultimate tax
liability could be much larger because the ruling covers only the
first year of a practice that has continued ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a rare victory for the IRS in its efforts to
prevent companies from taking tax deductions when they move money
to subsidiaries overseas for the sole purpose of avoiding taxes.

NAVY MOVES TO RESUME TIES WITH TAILHOOK ASSOCIATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add 10 grafs at end)  
 (ATTN: Nev., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Navy took its first step Tuesday to restore
official ties with the Tailhook Association, eight years after
sexual assaults and drunken revelry at the group's annual
convention roiled the Navy and led to changes in the military's
treatment of women.
</P>
<P>
   While stopping short of fully embracing the association, the
Navy said it would resume its formal support once it received
assurances that the group's leaders would never again tolerate the
sort of behavior that made the name Tailhook shorthand for
disrespect and mistreatment of women in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The Tailhook Association, which is based in San Diego, has
10,500 members, including retired and active-duty pilots, and acts
as a sort of booster club for carrier-based aviation. Although the
group is private, its members and activities up until 1991 were
closely associated to the Navy and its officer corps, particularly
those who had flown from aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Tuesday to the group's president, Navy Secretary
Richard Danzig welcomed ``a number of constructive steps'' the
association had taken since ``the shameful events'' of the 1991
convention, where 83 women, some in the Navy, reported being
assaulted or harassed in a Las Vegas hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig said those steps, including the adoption of resolutions
condemning harassment and promoting equality, merited a
reconsideration of its pariah status. He announced he would send
three senior Navy and Marine Corps officials to monitor this year's
convention, which begins Aug. 19 in Sparks, Nev., and after that
make a final decision on restoring ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to assess the extent to which the association lives by
these principles and has the potential to reflect in its membership
the charge and profile of today's _ and the future's _ naval
aviation community,'' said Danzig.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tailhook president Lonny McClung, a retired Navy captain and
pilot, welcomed the decision. In a telephone interview Tuesday,
McClung said the association had worked hard in recent years to
regain official status, the loss of which hurt the prestige and
morale of the group and made it difficult to recruit new members
from the active fleet. The association is named for the steel hook
that enables jets to land on carriers. ``We are thrilled, to say
the least,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tailhook scandal had a profound impact on the Navy and the
Marine Corps. The Pentagon's inspector general implicated more than
100 officers in the assaults or other riotous behavior at the
group's 35th annual convention in September 1991. The worst of the
assaults came when a group of drunken pilots formed a gantlet in a
hotel corridor and molested women as they passed.
</P>
<P>
   To many, the assaults reflected a military culture that condoned
machismo and worse. The public uproar over the assaults ultimately
led to the resignation of Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett and the
early retirement of the chief of naval operations, Adm. Frank
Kelso, both of whom attended the convention, though they denied
witnessing the worst of the behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Tailhook's most lasting legacy may have been to focus attention
on the role of women in the military, which since 1991 has expanded
greatly, prompted, some have argued, by the furor over the scandal.
Women now make up 13.3 percent of Navy personnel and serve in
virtually every job, from commanding warships to flying fighter
jets off carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has been under pressure, from inside and outside the
service, to renew its ties to Tailhook. The influential chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a
former Navy pilot, led a campaign on behalf of the group, which was
founded in 1956. Tuesday's announcement _ essentially a half-step _
appeared designed in part to gauge public sentiment for restoring
ties.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Danzig cited three criteria he would use to
consider the association's status, including its attention to
professional development and education and its support ``in word
and deed of all the men and women in the carrier aviation
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Danzig wrote, ``the association must be committed to
preventing, and take all reasonable steps to prevent, the type of
misconduct that resulted in the removal of departmental support in
1991.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Navy never prohibited membership or attendance at
the conventions, most officers, especially senior officers, avoid
Tailhook like the plague. In a letter to Danzig in March, Warner
argued that bestowing official recognition would boost morale among
pilots and encourage them to stay in the service.
</P>
<P>
   McClung said the association had got past the scandal, shifting
the focus of the conventions from socializing to informational
seminars and moving the site from Las Vegas to the more subdued
surroundings of Sparks, which is near Reno. He also said the group
now encouraged wives and family members to attend by offering
seminars geared to their interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had color coordination seminars for the wives,'' McClung
said, describing some of the changes. ``We're really trying to
improve our image a bit.''

 &HT;    Garden.com delays its stock offering
 &HT;    By Lori Hawkins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Reacting to Wall Street's recent icy reception
to Internet initial public offerings, Garden.com Inc. delayed its
IPO on Tuesday, becoming the latest in a number of skittish
technology companies to put a stock issue on hold.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin company, which sells plants and gardening equipment
over its Web site, had hoped to raise more than $45 million in the
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Garden.com officials did not return calls, and the company's
attorney declined to comment. While about 30 IPOs were planned for
this week, many companies are delaying, cance ling or reducing the
size and price of their offerings after demand by investors began
fading last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty apparent the Internet market is tanking fast,''
said Stephen Lacy, managing editor of IPO Reporter, a New
York-based publication that tracks the IPO market.
</P>
<P>
   What's spooking Wall Street are concerns over a possible
interest rate increase, a recent battering in technology stocks _
the tech-heavy Nasdaq index is down about 13 percent from its
52-week high _ and lousy showing by recent tech IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, seven companies that went public watched their stock
fall below their offering prices. In reaction, on Friday, eight
companies that were scheduled to go public postponed their debuts.
</P>
<P>
   For companies such as Garden.com, it's better to postpone an
offering than move forward and bomb, financial analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing you want is to bring a company public when the
market itself is struggling,'' Lacy said. ``If the original
investors pay $10 and it opens at $9 and closes at $8 and a half,
nobody's happy.''
</P>
<P>
   HotJobs.com, the New York-based online recruiter, is a case in
point. The company initially planned to price its stock at $12 to
$14, but slashed it to $8 late Monday. The stock closed Tuesday in
its first day of trading at $7.62 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's two most recent IPOs are both trading below their
offering prices. Shares of Hoover's Inc., which provides business
information over the Web, have slid 37 percent since its debut. The
stock began trading at $14 when it went public July 21. Tuesday, it
closed at $8.81 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Perficient Inc., which provides software services to Internet
companies, started trading at $8 on July 29 and closed Tuesday at
$7.93 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts don't expect the market to warm toward Internet IPOs
until the Federal Reserve announces later this month whether it
will increase interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the market psychology right now it's going to be very
hard for Internet IPOs to put together a strong rally until the
fourth quarter,'' said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at
George K. Baum and Co., a Kansas City investment bank. ``Their poor
performance over the past seven or eight weeks is making investors
very skeptical.'' This isn't the first time the IPO market has
turned cold.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, overall market volatility prevented all but a handful
of deals from getting done between the end of August and
mid-October because investors pulled back from everything but the
safest securities.
</P>
<P>
   And not everyone is backing off. In a bold move, Red Hat
Software, the Durham, N.C., vendor of Linux software, upped the
price range of its IPO by about 18 percent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it will offer 6 million shares at $12 to $14,
up from $10 to $12, in its $83 million IPO set for today.

<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial on Wednesday, Aug. 11:
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of 13 farm workers in a vehicle crash in Five Points,
Calif., underscores the need for better enforcement of the laws
that protect farm laborers. The circumstances of Monday's accident
are shocking but not uncommon _ an unlicensed driver ferrying 15
people home just before dawn in an overloaded van. It defies common
sense that vans used for the express purpose of transporting such
laborers are not required to have seat belts. Farm workers often
have no alternative means of transportation to and from the fields.
</P>
<P>
   These accidents are yet another mark of a callous system that
exploits the migrant laborer, allowing growers to shirk
accountability by using farm labor contractors as middlemen to hire
and manage the workers. Although California has relatively tough
laws protecting farm laborers, there are loopholes that place them
at risk. The law requires that drivers of these vans be specially
licensed, but in practice many are not. California already assigns
officers to patrol the highway in the early morning hours to stop
vehicles that violate occupancy and licensing laws. But these and
other efforts to prevent violations need to be increased.
</P>
<P>
   Steps must also be taken to force growers to take more
responsibility for the general safety of their workers. Their
political muscle has allowed them to abuse the system for too long.

NASA REASSESSES CAUSE OF LAUNCH SHORT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New findings on Tuesday prompted NASA to change its mind about
the cause of the electrical short that occurred during last month's
launching of the shuttle Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The short that disrupted the computer-like controllers on two of
the shuttle's three rocket engines was likely caused by a blow to a
wire beneath the payload bay, said James Hartsfield, a NASA shuttle
program spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency said Monday that engineers had determined the
short occurred five seconds after liftoff because insulation from
the wire had been chafed away over time against a screw head.
</P>
<P>
   Experts, however, changed their mind Tuesday after reviewing the
results of an analysis with an electron microscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``From looking at it with the electron microscope the
indentations in the wire were a telltale sign that it was really an
impact type of damage,'' Hartsfield said. The short could have
developed at any time since Columbia was manufactured, he said,
adding, ``They really don't know when it could have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of the shuttle orbiters, Columbia first flew in April
1981. The latest mission launched July 22 carrying NASA's $1.55
billion Chandra X-ray telescope, with skipper Eileen Collins, the
first female spacecraft commander, and four others.
</P>
<P>
   Had backup engine controllers not taken over after the
electrical short, Collins and pilot Jeff Ashby would have been
forced to attempt an unprecedented emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Tuesday's finding it was unclear what impact the
electrical short would have on NASA's plans to launch Endeavour on
Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   But shuttle managers delayed for a second day the transport of
Endeavour from its processing hangar at the Kennedy Space Center to
the large assembly facility where it is to be mated with its fuel
tank and twin solid-fuel rocket boosters.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour's wiring cannot be inspected without removing a large
radar device from its payload bay that astronauts will use to map
much of the Earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more research we want to gather to determine if this
is something to be concerned about that would cause us concern
against flying Endeavour,'' Hartsfield said.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is focused on a review of the documents from previous
instances in which technicians had access to the same wiring on
Endeavour, the least flown of the four orbiters. The areas is
seldom accessed, the spokesman said.

EDITORIAL: NEW TENSIONS ON THE SUBCONTINENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial on Wednesday, Aug. 11: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month after India and Pakistan stepped back from a
military clash in the Himalayan foothills of Kashmir, a new crisis
has erupted in another tense border area. The latest episode
involves the shooting down of a Pakistani military aircraft by an
Indian jet fighter over the marshy region along India's western
boundary with Pakistan. Both countries assert that the plane was
flying in their own air space when it was downed and that the
wreckage is in their territory. The incident shows the urgent need
for the two nations to ease distrust and improve communications.
</P>
<P>
   Now that India and Pakistan have tested nuclear weapons, there
is little margin for miscalculation in their relationship. There is
no guarantee that the presence of nuclear weapons on both sides
will produce the kind of relatively stable balance of terror that
prevailed between the United States and the Soviet Union during the
Cold War. It is essential that India and Pakistan insure that minor
military clashes do not escalate into volatile confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   The Kashmir crisis came to a head this summer after Islamic
militants, backed by Pakistan, seized several Indian positions in
the mountains. Under pressure from the United States, Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan wisely arranged for the
withdrawal of these forces last month. But promises by India and
Pakistan to resume their dialogue have not been fulfilled. Indeed,
tensions remain high.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that India and Pakistan both genuinely believe
they are the aggrieved party in the airplane downing. That would be
all the more reason to take concrete steps to exchange information
on maneuvers, flights near the border and accidental airspace
violations. A hot line between senior military commanders was
established years ago, and India and Pakistan promised earlier this
year to upgrade it. The region, and the world, cannot afford to let
such incidents spin out of control.

WITH HIS 13TH VISIT, DALAI LAMA GOES FROM OBSCURITY TO CELEBRITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the Dalai Lama's first trip to New York in 1979,
he went to see the Statue of Liberty. He and his colleagues went to
Battery Park, and the Dalai Lama stood on the pier and gazed across
the water, apparently not even recognized by passers-by. He gave
talks at various churches and Buddhist centers to a total of 1,000
people, without security guards, police escorts or trailing
photographers.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, as the exiled political and spiritual leader of
Tibet begins his 13th visit to New York, his fame and his following
will draw a more traditional reaction to celebrity. His every move
has been mapped out by the State Department. City police officers
are blocking off and stationing guards along his itinerary.
Photographers, television camera operators and reporters from
around the world will be following him. And an estimated 40,000
people are expected at the four major talks he is giving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is here not only for the Tibetan people but for everyone in
the city,'' said Tsering Yangzon, 24, of Brooklyn, who was born in
Darjeeling, Tibet. But though Westerners may be familiar with the
Dalai Lama, they often do not understand his spiritual
significance, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the difference, being Tibetan,'' Ms. Yangzon said. ``He
is so sacred _ if you see his name in the newspaper, you do not
throw it away. He is not just a plaything. It is so politically
right to become Buddhist, like Hollywood does. There are Buddha
T-shirts as a fashion statement. It's not that that is negative.
But it's sad. The Dalai Lama is not a style that will fizzle out.
The Dalai Lama is so sacred to us.''
</P>
<P>
   However staunch or fickle his admirers, the city is full of
them, and the Dalai Lama's days of strolling the city's streets
unattended are long over, banished by the Nobel Peace Prize, the
Beastie Boys, Richard Gere and a host of magazine covers. His name
is invoked at rock concerts, his face stares down from billboards
and the book he wrote with Howard C. Cutler, ``The Art of
Happiness,'' (Riverhead Books, 1999) has been on the best-seller
list for 29 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his free lecture in Central Park at 11 a.m. on
Sunday, the Dalai Lama is making three other public appearances on
this trip, which is sponsored by the Gere Foundation. All three
appearances, at the Beacon Theater, have been sold out.
</P>
<P>
   The approximately 2,500 Tibetans living in the New York
metropolitan area are watching the rapidly growing adulation of
their leader with delight and bemusement.
</P>
<P>
   For people reared to revere the Dalai Lama as the enlightened
embodiment of compassion, the widespread admiration, Nobel Peace
Prize or no, is natural, proper and due. But they hope that the
admiration will spill over into political action that will help
free Tibet from Chinese occupation, bringing independence, or at
least a negotiated settlement that would allow the Tibetans more
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good that everybody knows the Dalai Lama,'' said Tenzing
Ukyab, owner of the two Tibet Arts and Crafts stores in downtown
Manhattan. ``He has compassion for everybody. He talks about peace
for the whole world, not just the Tibetan people. And it is good
that everybody knows the Tibet situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The bemusement among Tibetans stems in part from their deep
connection to their exiled leader. ``He is everything to
Tibetans,'' said Thupten Thokmey, head of the international Tibetan
Youth Congress, a group of 4,000 Tibetan students, and a student at
Baruch College. ``We sleep, we die, we eat, we are happy, we suffer
_ and we think of him.''

TAX COURT SAYS UPS INFLATED DEDUCTIONS AND MUST BE PENALIZED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 4th, 5th and 6th grafs for additional information and
rewriting; adds 2 new grafs at end)  
 (ATTN: Ga.)   (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A judge has ruled that United Parcel Service took inflated tax
deductions in 1984 and must pay taxes, penalties and interest that
the company said may total nearly $300 million for that year.
</P>
<P>
   But its ultimate tax liability could be much larger _ perhaps
growing into one of the biggest corporate tax cases ever _ because
the Tax Court decision, issued Monday, covers only the first year
of a business practice that has continued ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The 114-page decision, and its withering dissection of testimony
by UPS executives, was a rare victory for the IRS in its efforts to
prevent companies from taking tax deductions when they move money
to subsidiaries overseas for the sole purpose of avoiding taxes.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, United Parcel Service would not estimate its
potential liability. But previously, the company had disclosed that
it could owe $259 million in taxes alone for its returns covering
the years 1985 through 1990, which have been challenged by the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, UPS has continued to claim these deductions on the
same theory that the Tax Court denied, said Kenneth Sternad, the
chief spokesman for the company. It expects the IRS to contest its
tax payments for the subsequent years. Based on the company's past
estimates of tax liability, its total in taxes, interest and
penalties could easily surpass a billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   UPS may appeal Monday's decision, Sternad said. The case would
move to the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta, where
UPS is based.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will not affect plans, announced by the company in
July, to sell shares to the public for the first time, Sternad
said.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the civil tax case were deductions that UPS took for
the costs of insuring against damaged or lost parcels worth more
than $100.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS claimed that UPS charged customers three times the
actual cost of the insurance in a scheme to funnel money to an
insurance company it created in 1984 in Bermuda, thereby inflating
its tax deductions. UPS charged customers 25 cents per $100 for
``extra value coverage'' in 1984. It then paid the money over to
National Union Fire Insurance of Pittsburgh and took a deduction
for the expense.
</P>
<P>
   But the transaction was a sham, wrote Judge Robert Ruwe in his
ruling. National Union was merely acting as a front, he said,
because after taking a small fee, it sent the money on to Overseas
Partners Ltd., a Bermuda insurance company owned and controlled by
UPS.
</P>
<P>
   United Parcel argued that its insurance fees were reasonable,
but the judge held that the rates were as much as three times what
UPS would have paid had it bought the insurance in the open market,
instead of through its own insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas Partners counted at least 63 cents of each dollar it
received as profit, Ruwe wrote _ in some years as much as 78 cents
on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   In funneling business to the Bermuda insurer, the judge ruled,
UPS was motivated only to reduce its income taxes in the United
States, and not by any legitimate business purpose. It is legal to
organize business activities in ways that reduce taxes _ but it is
illegal to engage in transactions whose sole purpose is to avoid
taxes, Ruwe noted.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted at length the testimony of Neil Doherty, an expert
witness hired by the company for the Tax Court proceedings. At
trial, an IRS lawyer asked Doherty if the 25-cent-per-$100 fee
would have made sense for UPS if the money were not being paid to
an insurer it controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a rather strange business decision to basically
give off that profit to an outsider,'' testified Doherty, a
professor of insurance and risk management at the Wharton School of
the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The inflated insurance charges allowed UPS to take nearly $65
million in improper deductions, the judge held, while inflating the
profits of Overseas Partners, which is not required to pay United
States income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The judge upheld the IRS's finding that the company owed $64.9
million in tax, a $3.2 million penalty for negligence, an
additional $11.3 million penalty for substantial underpayment of a
tax liability and interest at 50 percent above the usual rates on
$45 million of the underpayment.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to 1984, the judge wrote, UPS collected fees to cover
damage or loss to packages worth more than $100 and treated that
money as part of its regular revenue stream, paying taxes on its
profits.
</P>
<P>
   The company argued that it had created the Bermuda insurance
company not to avoid taxes, but to avoid running afoul of state
insurance regulators, some of which had questioned car rental
companies about charges they added to customer bills to cover
potential damage to vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Johnson, at the time the company's chief insurance
official, acknowledged in his testimony in the case that no state
insurance official had challenged UPS and that he had never asked
any state or federal official if the company was acting improperly
in charging the fees.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also noted that UPS had letters from each state
authorizing its earlier practice of adding charges for high-value
packages.
</P>
<P>
   As a major company, Ruwe wrote, he would have expected UPS to
investigate any such risks and to produce documents showing its
legal and economic analysis of the issue. But during the period it
was considering setting up the Bermuda insurer, he added, UPS
``produced no documentation, such as corporate minutes'' indicating
that it ``had motives other than tax reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   Sternad, the company spokesman, said UPS believed the judge was
wrong and that its insurance charges were reasonable. He said the
company was not considering making refunds to customers. The IRS
has fought an uphill battle against a range of practices by
corporations intended to reduce their income taxes in the United
States by taking profits in countries that charge little or no
corporate income tax, such as Bermuda, Luxembourg and the Cayman
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   There are many legitimate reasons for companies to move funds
overseas, tax experts note, so the IRS must prove the sole motive
for the transaction was tax avoidance.
</P>
<P>
   In insurance arrangements like that set up by UPS, it has been
nearly impossible for the IRS ``to draw a bright line around which
payments to captive insurance companies are proper and which are
not,'' said Andrew Pike, a former Treasury official who teaches tax
law at American University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has lost cases involving captive insurance companies
owned by Gulf Oil; Sears, Roebuck; U-Haul; Humana; and others,
according to Lee Sheppard, a New York lawyer who writes for Tax
Notes magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the IRS lost a $180 million case against National
Westminster Bank PLC a big British bank, over how it allocated
interest expenses between its U.S. and overseas operations.  &QL;

   HOUSTON _ The shooting rampage at a Los Angeles Jewish community
center Tuesday was shocking to most of the world. But for 10
Israeli girls playing volleyball as part of the Maccabi Games in
Houston, news of violence is part of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really scary; it's more sad than scary,'' said Liat Adiv,
16. ``It's very sad to know that after so many years that people
still want to hurt us. We feel this all the time in Israel, but
it's hard to see that this happens all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Los Angeles continued searching Tuesday for a
gunman who entered a Jewish community center and fired 20 to 30
shots with what police said was a high-powered weapon with a large
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Five people were wounded, including three boys who were
attending camp at the community center, according to The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The motive was unknown, but police are not ruling out the
possibility it might be a hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County constables informed coaches and directors of the
Israeli team, who are among about 1,600 Jewish teen-agers
participating in the Houston portion of the Maccabi Games, about
the shootings while the group was playing against a team from
Detroit on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was made to keep the Israeli team members together
and step up security with police escorts to and from the venues of
the games, according to Jason Black, communications director for
the Jewish Community Center in southwest Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Cheek, a constable in Harris County, which includes most of
Houston, said more security officers might be added in the wake of
the Los Angeles shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real tragic situation,'' said Cheek, who had met
over a period of several months with Maccabi officials to arrange
security for the games. ``Obviously we'll be more alert, but for
right now we're going to stick with our plan. We'll meet throughout
the night to figure out if there is something more we need to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow, we may have the horse patrol out there for
visibility and to provide a sense of security.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli team captain Anat Matus, 16, was comforted by the extra
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all the time in Israel,'' Matus said. ``You go on a bus,
and you never know if it's going to blow or not. It's very scary;
at least now I know we'll be safe. It's very good to have the
escorts.''
</P>
<P>
   JCC officials in Houston released a statement saying their
thoughts and prayers would be with the families victimized by the
shooting in Los Angeles. Organizers declined to make any further
statements until the identity and motivation of the perpetrator was
identified.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bunny Radolff, part of public relations for the Houston JCC, was
unaware that security for the Israel volleyball team had been
increased and refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have absolutely no knowledge of the extra security,'' said
Radolff. ``I don't know anything about that and it's probably just
someone reacting to the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheek said her reaction wasn't unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediately on hearing the news we did bring in extra people
but I'm sure not everyone there was totally aware of that,'' said
Cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Adiv said the news of the shooting gives her volleyball team
motivation to finish the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes us believe that we have to win now,'' Adiv said.
``We have to show all the world that we exist and there is nothing
more they can do to us.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the latest in a string of seemingly
inexplicable shootings, a balding, white, middle-aged man walked
into a Jewish community center in a middle-class suburb Tuesday
morning and fired as many as 30 shots, wounding five people,
including three young boys at a day camp, and then fled.
</P>
<P>
   A 3{-year-old boy who said he was just a few feet from the
shooting _ his mother would only give his name as Eric _ said the
man said nothing before fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad monster ran away,'' said the boy, who clung to his
mother and asked her if any of the wounded children had done
anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   One of the victims, a 5-year-old boy, who had been shot in the
abdomen, was said to be in critical condition after undergoing
surgery, while the other victims were said to be in good condition
and were expected to be released soon from local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Police with dogs cordoned off the area around the North Valley
Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills to search for the gunman,
described as about 40 years old, but by Tuesday evening they had
not found him and believed he was no longer in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they had no idea who he was or why he had opened
fire and that none of the people who saw the shooter at the center
recognized him.
</P>
<P>
   Officials asked residents of the neighborhood to remain indoors
as they conducted their search, but police lines quickly became
jammed with parents waiting anxiously to hear about their children.
</P>
<P>
   Within 30 minutes after the shooting at 10:45 a.m., helicopter
crews from local television stations broadcast images of police
officers leading children out of the center by hand, in strings of
five, six and seven. Firefighters and paramedics at the scene said
the children had been orderly, though upset.
</P>
<P>
   The images of fleeing children, anxious parents and armed
officers searching alleys, sheds and homes in the area were
broadcast for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents who were reunited with their children in the street
then stayed in the area, hugging their children, chatting with
friends and other parents, apparently so stunned by the violence
that they seemed unconcerned that the shooter could still be in the
neighborhood. Around midday, the Fire Department brought a cooler
of drinks for parents, many who were still waiting for word on the
whereabouts of their children.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Shalometh Golden was quoted by the City News Service as
saying that her mother, Isabelle Shalometh, a receptionist at the
center, had been wounded lightly in the arm and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said a young man, a ruffian, she saw him coming at her and
I guess he just started open firing,'' Ms. Golden said, ``and she
knew enough to quickly duck down and she did.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire Department Capt. Steve Ruda said that in addition to Ms.
Shalometh, who he said was 68, a 16-year-old girl was shot in the
right thigh and shin, a 6-year-old boy was wounded in the left foot
and another 6-year-old boy was shot in the left leg and hip. The
most seriously sounded was the 5-year-old boy hit in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the shooter was between 5 feet 8 and 5 feet 10,
about 170 pounds, and was dressed in green clothing. He fired as
many as 30 shots from a 9-millimeter handgun, then apparently fled
on foot, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the police said that two young men had been
responsible, but later attributed that description to confusion by
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms sent
agents to the residential area, in the San Fernando Valley about 30
miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, to assist local police.
</P>
<P>
   Police were sifting through a number of clues, whose relation
remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. Police Cmdr. David Kalish said they had searched a red van
with Washington state license plates, in an area not far from the
shooting and had found ``an incredible amount of ammunition,'' a
bulletproof vest and ``substantial other evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Police also said that about noon there had been a carjacking in
which a white male who generally matched the description of the
shooter had stolen a dark green 1999 Toyota Corolla. The police
later said that the van's driver was the same man who had stolen
the car at gunpoint, and that they had been led to the van while
investigating the car theft. Later, police found the Toyota several
miles away at a hotel that they barricaded and surrounded.
</P>
<P>
   Because the incident followed a string of school shootings in
recent months, and comes in the middle of an intense debate over
the availability of firearms, it was followed closely by officials
across the state and in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said, ``Once again our nation has been shaken
and our hearts torn'' by what he called ``another senseless act of
gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   California Gov. Gray Davis said, ``Once again, we have been
shocked, saddened and outraged by an act of vicious gun violence
aimed against defenseless children and innocent adults.'' He
offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The North Valley Jewish Community Center is an educational and
recreation facility where the elderly come to play cards, parents
drop their toddlers off for pre-school, singles play tennis and
children learned to swim in the pool.
</P>
<P>
   There are after-school enrichment classes on gymnastics, karate,
cooking and celebrating the Sabbath. Children learned to make
traditional braided challah bread and how to celebrate the Jewish
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The ``little red schoolhouse,'' a small facility behind the main
building, houses the pre-school for children aged 2 and 3. The
pre-school's security rules required that parents sign children in
and out each day.
</P>
<P>
   Although the neighborhood is generally quiet, several residents
said there have been growing racial tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Trombley, 18, who graduated last year from the local high
school, said Granada Hills is largely white, with a mix of blue
collar and white collar families. But, he said, it borders on one
side a largely Asian neighborhood, and on another side a Latino
neighborhood, and there have been sporadic racial tensions, with
fights involving teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of life around here,'' he said. ``You just accept
it.''

 &HT;    'Oh God, not again!' Atlantans share pain
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After the shootings Tuesday in Los Angeles, cameras
caught a woman scooping up a girl in a pink tie-dyed skirt, hugging
her so tightly that the child's T-shirt rode up over her shoulder
blades and her sneakered feet kicked in midair.
</P>
<P>
   All over Atlanta, parents had the same visceral impulse: to grab
their children. To clutch them close. To feel that they could be
safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You send your child off to an allegedly safe place, a place
with nursery story characters painted on the wall, and something
like this happens,'' Carey Sipp, an Atlanta author and mother of
two, said in disbelief. ``I just don't know what we're going to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been less than two weeks since Mark O. Barton killed 12
people in Stockbridge and Buckhead, including his own two children,
wounded 13 and then ended his own life with a bullet to the head;
less than three months since Anthony ``T.J.'' Solomon shot into a
crowd of 200 Heritage High School students in suburban Rockdale
County, wounding six; and less than four months since Dylan Klebold
and Eric Harris killed a teacher, 12 students and themselves at
Columbine High School in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   In his office at Emory University, gun violence researcher and
father Arthur Kellerman read reports of the L.A. shooting on the
Web. ``Oh, God,'' he said. ``Not again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad enough it was another shooting, another inexplicable
outburst of rage, another attempted mass murder. Much worse that
most of the victims were young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``To hurt a child _ that's unthinkable for most of us,'' said
Nadine Kaslow, chief psychologist at Grady Memorial Hospital. ``But
for some small group of very troubled, very angry people, that
inhibition isn't there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Atlantans, reactions to the shootings were as poignant and
identifiable as headings on a counselor's chart: disbelief,
outrage, grief, fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that goes through your mind, no matter where
you are, is: Where are my kids?'' said Dr. Philip Shayne, an
emergency physician at Grady, who treated some of Barton's victims
and whose wife is pregnant with their second child.
</P>
<P>
   At the Hamilton Mill Child Development Center in Buford, Ga.,
where an 18-month-old was kidnapped at gunpoint by a parent four
months ago, administrator Faye Miles lamented the precautions she
has to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our world was much safer'' when she started in day care 37
years ago, she said. ``Our communities were much safer. We live in
a world of strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a jaded world as well, adults worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear about things you didn't used to,'' said Lee Leonard,
whose 4-year-old attends Atlanta Cooperative Preschool. ``I hope
I'm not becoming desensitized.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Hannah Miller, a college junior working during the summer
at Inman Park Cooperative Preschool: ``As much as we think we can
protect the children in our care, there are some things we can't
protect against.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is home to some of the country's top researchers into
violence. The idea that the L.A. shootings could be dismissed as
random troubled them almost as much as the shootings themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Columbine, after Heritage High School, after Buckhead,
you wonder what is it going to take for us as a society to get off
our backsides and try to tackle this problem,'' Kellerman said.
``What will it take for us to shake off the fatalistic sense that
there is nothing we can do about this?''
</P>
<P>
   Understanding and preventing violence is Rodney Hammond's
vocation. He is a psychologist who heads the Division of Violence
Prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and
he has a grown son.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The shootings) make me feel, at a very basic level, worried
about the safety of our communities, and desperately wanting to
know something I can do to predict situations where this kind of
event would affect me or my children,'' he said. ``What nags at you
is, what would deter an incident like this? It underlines that we
need to move the discussion to prevention, to understanding some of
the causes of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houghton family, leaving the Downtown Child Development
Center with their three sons, four hours after the shootings in
L.A., couldn't begin to understand. Both parents are Europeans,
John from England and Christine from Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't see this sort of things as regularly as here,''
John Houghton said. ``The gun part of this country is amazing.
Everyone, just everyone, seems to be allowed to get a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   And so few men have other outlets, his wife added. ``There
doesn't seem to be anyone who helps them resolve their problems.
It's quite sad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans were just as dismayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being pregnant, I wonder about the society I'm bringing a
child into,'' said Dr. Tammie Quest, a Grady emergency physician.
``There's such a depersonalization. We don't relate to each other
as humans anymore; it's as though people are targets or objects.''
</P>
<P>
   Or bargaining chits, Kaslow said. ``Children are our most
precious commodity. Society pays attention when they are harmed,''
she said. ``I really think that when people are angry and hostile
and hate the world, they know they'll be most heard by attacking
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The more these shootings are televised, the more appealing that
twisted logic may become, Emory's Kellerman contended. ``It would
be hard for anyone not to argue that there's a copycat phenomenon
going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The thought that the recent shootings will continue _ and that
children could be even more at risk _ frightens both parents and
children themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 6 or 7, I didn't have to think about this stuff,
but now I have to deal with it,'' said 13-year-old Brittany
Harrington Pool. ``All this makes me more aware and makes me more
worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Evie Weinreich, who teaches at a Jewish school, was watching TV
reports of the L.A. shootings when her two sons came in from
religious camp. Tzvi, 11, and David, almost 8, knew Allen Charles
Tenenbaum, one of Barton's victims; their mother had taught his
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your heart breaks,'' she said. ``It's a horrible reflection on
society. We have to find a way to do something, or we're going to
destroy ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son asked me, `Can I go outside and play?' '' she said,
``and I hesitated.''

EDITORIAL: THE $2 BILLION ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
   (yn) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Aug. 11:
</P>
<P>
   It is getting more and more expensive to influence politicians.
The Republican Party, looking ahead to next year's presidential and
Congressional elections, has recently established ``Team $1
Million.'' As Don Van Natta Jr. recently reported in The Times,
membership will cost donors a cool $1 million in campaign
contributions. But membership has its privileges. In return for the
money, among other things, donors will be given opportunities to
discuss their concerns with House Speaker Dennis Hastert, the
Senate majority leader, Trent Lott and other Congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   With fund-raising on that scale, the current political season
will almost certainly produce the first $2 billion election. The
amount of unregulated ``soft money'' from corporations, unions and
wealthy individuals is likely to double or even triple the $260
billion hauled in during the last presidential campaign, when
President Clinton opened the White House to sleepovers and coffees,
inviting such abuses as foreign contributions that later had to be
returned. More scandals and evidence of favors in return for
donations are bound to corrupt the system as fund-raising
accelerates in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   A fairly good example of the corruption of campaign money can be
found in the $792 billion tax cut recently approved by Congress.
Republicans know that Clinton will veto this bill. But they are
shopping it around during the August recess to the health care,
real estate, oil and gas, timber and securities industries, all of
which got special tax breaks in the legislation. The argument to
these industries is that they can make a donation now to ensure
that their special deal survives if there is a final tax cut accord
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder that Hastert and Lott will be fighting once again
to kill campaign finance reform. The latest maneuver occurred last
week, when the House speaker put forward a rule governing debate on
the issue next month. Hastert did keep his promise to Reps.
Christopher Shays of Connecticut and Martin Meehan of Massachusetts
to allow their bill to be considered. But in a tactic reminiscent
of those used last year, Hastert would allow the House first to
vote on a toothless substitute bill. If it passes, there would be
no vote on the Shays-Meehan bill itself. To defeat this maneuver,
House members will have to vote against a measure that
superficially looks attractive so they can vote for the
Shays-Meehan reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Most members are likely to see through the speaker's tactics. If
they do not, they will consign Americans to a system that strangles
democracy and deepens the cynicism of voters. The Shays-Meehan bill
would clean up the system by banning corporate and union donations
to parties and applying strict limits to donations by individuals
and political action committees. It would also extend these curbs
to money raised by independent groups running campaign ads within
60 days of an election.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom in Washington is that this legislation
cannot pass, even though it commands healthy majorities in the
House and Senate. In fact, the Shays-Meehan bill can be approved by
the House in September, and by the Senate in October, if lawmakers
respond to their constituents instead of party cash machines. The
August recess is a fine time for Americans to remind their senators
and congressmen that citizen interests, not special interests,
should rule in Washington.

FETUS IN LIFE-SUPPORT CASE APPARENTLY DIES 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A 17-week-old fetus at the center of a fight over
whether a comatose woman should be kept alive by artificial means
has apparently died, lawyers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors noticed Monday night that the fetus' heart had stopped
beating while preparing the mother, Tammy Martin, for a
tracheotomy, attorney Craig Smyser said during a court hearing
Tuesday. Smyser represents Memorial Hospital Northwest in north
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Smyser told Harris County Probate Judge Rory Olsen that a
radiologist performed sonogram tests, found no fetal movement and
confirmed Tuesday that the fetus had apparently died.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen ordered further tests of the fetus and Martin within 10
days by doctors unconnected to the hospital. Martin, 34, fell into
a coma from a blow to the head July 18, and until Tuesday hospital
officials had reported the fetus had a heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Law, 35, a Houston man who claims to be the biological
father of the child and the common-law husband of Martin, cried
after the hearing and was too distraught to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's destroyed his world. The baby meant everything to him,''
said Law's attorney, Jared Woodfill. ``He got into this battle
because he wanted the child to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Law sued the hospital July 23, claiming it was conspiring with
Martin's family to let her die and that he was being shut out of
the decision-making process. A judge that day ordered the hospital
to not withhold life-support treatment, and July 30 Law was
declared to be Martin's temporary guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's parents, J.D. and Joyce Cox of Bracketville in South
Texas, and her brother, Lonnie Martin of Splendora, have said that
the life support should be removed because doctors told them she is
brain-dead and the fetus had little, if any, chance of being born
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   They said they would fight to remove the life support even if
the fetus' heart kept beating, claiming Law is not Martin's
common-law husband and may not be the father of the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew in our hearts and in our souls the fetus would never
make it,'' Lonnie Martin said from his home after the hearing. ``We
had the feeling that God was going to do God's work. I do believe
God had delivered my sister's wish.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers involved said they expect the court-appointed
doctors to do the tests within 10 days and for another hearing to
held afterward. Olsen scheduled a hearing for Aug. 23 to determine
who should be Martin's guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Woodfill said the court-appointed doctors will not perform an
official test to determine whether Martin is brain-dead. He said
the test, called an apnea test, will presumably be ordered by the
court after the independent doctors report their findings. Apnea
tests measure the ability of the brain to stimulate a breathing
response after ventilators are turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Woodfill said that if Martin is declared brain-dead, he is not
sure Law would want to cut off life support. In court documents
filed last week, Law said he believes Martin is showing increasing
brain activity.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County sheriff's officials confirmed Tuesday that if
Martin is declared brain dead, they plan to ask prosecutors to
consider filing charges of criminally negligent homicide against
Law.
</P>
<P>
   Law, a concrete crew supervisor, has declined to discuss the
blow to Martin's head in detail because he knew he was being
investigated by law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   He has denied any wrongdoing, saying the door of a pickup hit
Martin's head when it jumped out of gear and that she had seemed OK
and went to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   He said she woke up hours later at their home, started throwing
up and fell unconscious. He said doctors told him there was no way
for him to know that a major blood vessel had ruptured.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's parents and brother believe Law was either negligent by
not calling for an ambulance sooner or that he may have assaulted
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will rest in peace until the story of what happened is
told,'' Lonnie Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Woodfill said Law was stunned by the reported death of the fetus
because doctors had been saying for more than a week that the
heartbeat was getting stronger and the organs were developing
normally.
</P>
<P>
   Woodfill said doctors noticed the heartbeat stopped after Martin
was moved to an operating room for the tracheotomy, a procedure to
enable her to be fed. He said he did not know if the move may have
injured the fetus because he hadn't seen hospital records.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's attorney, Smyser, said he did not know the
details of the fetus' apparent death. Hospital spokeswoman Patty
Riddlebarger said she did not know if doctors had a theory as to
what may have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was facing two years in prison for violating parole after
being convicted of injecting cocaine into the minor daughter of her
former boyfriend, Ben Bruce. Martin's family has described her as
an alcoholic and cocaine addict, and they say doctors told them if
the fetus was born it would likely be retarded or deformed because
of the mother's addictions.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce, who has said he planned to file a petition to be declared
Martin's common-law husband, said Tuesday he would not know until
further proceedings if he would still want to take such a step. He
declined to comment further.

CABLEVISION DEAL TO BUY METS IS `REAL CLOSE'
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The public's focus on the Mets this season has been
on their proximity to first place, but off the field they have
moved quietly and steadily closer to a deal for the team's
$400-million sale to Cablevision. How close?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're real close,'' the owner of another team said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting awfully close,'' said another owner, who also
requested anonymity, adding that they're so close ``they're sending
papers back and forth putting in the last details.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wilpon, one of the Mets' co-owners, declined to comment on
those observations. His silence is understandable considering that
George Steinbrenner's negotiations with Cablevision for the sale of
the Yankees collapsed after Steinbrenner talked publicly about a
possible deal. Charles Dolan, the No. 1 man at Cablevision,
conducts his business in total privacy and doesn't like anyone
talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   The other team owners said that under terms of the sale Wilpon
would operate the Mets while Nelson Doubleday, the other Mets
co-owner, would remain with the club in an executive capacity.
Wilson and Doubleday are each supposed to keep a 10 percent
interest in the team.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday, asked if a deal was close, said, ``I don't have a
signed piece of paper,'' adding that he had ``people sniffing
around'' to find out if a deal is close.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the business merger between the Yankees and the Nets
remains incomplete. One team owner said Tuesday that the Nets have
deposited the $225 million they will pay the Yankees to offset the
difference in the value of the two teams but that Steinbrenner
remained undecided on whether to go through with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner denied that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who would be starting that rumor,'' he said.
``There's no truth to that. It's moving along. We're waiting for
baseball's approval, and then NBA approval. That's all I know. We
have no other plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed transaction, unique in professional sports and also
very complex, has created a problem for Major League Baseball.
Commissioner Bud Selig must decide whether the deal creates a
control issue. If he concludes that it does, the deal would have to
go before the ownership committee.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner apparently has argued that there would be no change
in control so it should not have to be voted on by the ownership
committee. If Selig agrees, it would be up to him to approve it.

ATTICA: THE PAIN, LIKE THE LAWSUIT, PERSISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JAN HOFFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even now, 28 years later, as Frank B.B. Smith sits
talking with his wife, Pearl, on their porch in Queens Village, you
can sense why he had the respect of both the inmates and the guards
when he was doing time at Attica. He is blunt and funny, with a
hustler's charm. He is also intimidating: 6-foot-1, 230 pounds back
then, and his middle initials stand for Big Black. Call him Black,
please! he says warmly.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a former junkie and petty criminal who had been convicted
of holding up a dice game, was the inmates' football coach. The
warden gave him special privileges.
</P>
<P>
   And on that September morning when the rebellion over prison
conditions erupted, the inmates selected Smith to be chief of
security and protect negotiators. Five days later, when troopers
stormed the prison, wounding 88 men and killing 29 inmates and 10
hostages in six minutes, they reserved a vengeful torture for the
man everyone had trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in the latest chess move of a 25-year-old lawsuit, a
federal appeals court overturned the $4 million jury verdict
awarded Smith for what happened to him that endless day. While not
disputing the events, the court said the trial judge had made
significant errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about that decision,'' Smith says. ``I play the
Lotto. It might pop for me that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughter. Then he adds quietly, ``I'm a humorous-sounding
person, but inside I'm hurting. I am so sick of the law business.''
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 13, 1971: Guards and troopers made Smith lie naked on a
table, a football under his chin. If it fell, they warned, he would
be killed or castrated. (There was a rumor he had castrated a
guard, who had in fact been shot inadvertently by troopers.) For
several hours, they beat him around the head and testicles,
dropping lighted cigarettes and hot shell casings on his belly.
</P>
<P>
   Then, prodding with batons, they forced Smith, his legs
buckling, toward a corridor from which, witnesses testified, could
be heard the rhythmic thunder of clubs against a wall and voices
chanting, ``We're waiting for you, Frank!'' Barefoot, he stumbled
across the broken glass, strewn for the gantlet.
</P>
<P>
   That night he was dumped, nude and bleeding, wrists broken, in
an isolation cell. As he lay spread-eagled, guards taunted him with
a gun, playing Russian roulette.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has told this story many times, the retellings have
not worn down the rage and incredulity in his voice. Mrs. Smith
leans forward and says that, years later, ``He would have
flashbacks at night, and he'd be on the floor crying like a baby as
if he was reliving the rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Smith, 66, says: ``Attica was my downfall and my
lifesaver.'' For when he was released in 1973, he realized that
however easy it would be to commit more crimes, the last thing he
wanted was a return ticket to Attica. He became a leader for the
Attica Brothers Legal Defense, helping to raise more than $1
million to contest the indictments against himself and 61 others
stemming from the uprising.
</P>
<P>
   After his and most other cases were dismissed, Smith,
articulate, imposing, wrapped in the mantle of the Attica tragedy,
emerged as a sought-after presence at many left-wing events, as
well as at schools, community centers and colleges, where he
continues to speak about preventing future Atticas. He moved
comfortably among groups like the Black Panthers and the Black
Liberation Army: ``Angela Davis, she's my buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as he never sided with one gang, he never allied with
one organization. ``I believe in spreading around and not locking
myself in,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He was also struggling with a cocaine addiction, which had
dogged him since his younger days in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section
of Brooklyn. By 1986, he finally got clean. He became a substance
abuse counselor, and, like Pearl, whom he had married in 1983 and
who works in the Staten Island Family Court, took a special
interest in troubled adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   And though he had only an 11th-grade education, he apprenticed
himself as a paralegal with Elizabeth M. Fink, a lawyer who has
represented him since 1974 and who has pressed the civil suit since
1981. He free-lances for lawyers as a paralegal and an
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, now 320 pounds, places his hands over his belly, clearly
enjoying the grand joke in which he is working in the court system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to find people, ask questions, get statements,'' he
says. ``I know how to lie to the judge and get something done. The
cops wave and say, `How are you doing, Black?'''
</P>
<P>
   He is doing fine, even became born-again four years ago. It's
just that Attica is unfinished. ``Attica is 28 years of my life,''
he says. ``I sleep with it, I eat with it, it's everything to me.''
He is flabbergasted that the lawsuit which he and other inmates
filed in 1975 seeking reparations from the police shootings and
tortures is still unresolved, following last week's court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   He has been running his mouth for a while. Mrs. Smith again
leans forward. ``He's big and vocal, but underneath it all he's a
really good person,'' she says. She smiles fondly. ``He'll say:
`Pearl, do you have an idea of what you want to wear tomorrow? I'll
iron it for you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Smith looks a tad embarrassed. ``I worked in the laundry,'' he
says, ``when I was at Attica.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Laskowski, an international vice president of the United
Auto Workers who was in charge of negotiations with the
DaimlerChrysler Corporation, died Aug. 8 in Lewiston, Mich. He was
59 and lived in Canton, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, a spokesman for the union, Roger
Kerson, said.
</P>
<P>
   Laskowski and Tom Gallagher, DaimlerChrysler's negotiator, had
been holding talks this summer on wages and working conditions for
the 75,000 hourly union members employed by the auto maker. The
talks were focused on a national contract to replace one that
expires on Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Laskowski became vice president of the union in 1995 and was
elected one of its five international vice presidents in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He oversaw negotiations with the former Chrysler Corp. in the
last round of national bargaining in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Laskowski also served on the board of directors of Navistar Inc.
and Delta Dental of Michigan; he was attending a Delta Dental board
meeting when he was stricken.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Laskowski was born April 8, 1940, in Bay City, Mich., a son
of an auto worker. He attended Bay City Junior College and Alma
College. He joined the union in 1958 when he went to work on the
assembly line at the General Motors plant in Bay City.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Sally; three sons, Greg, of Los
Angeles, Tim, of Kalamazoo, Mich., and Mike, of Adrian, Mich.;
three brothers, Al, of Bay City, Tom, of Auburn, Mich., and Terry,
of Bay City, and two sisters, Germaine O'Daniel of Fort Wayne,
Ind., and Clara Strzelecki of Bay City.

JOHNNY VAN RYN, 94, SPECIALIST IN DOUBLES FOR U.S. DAVIS CUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Va., Texas, N.J.)   (bl)  
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Johnny Van Ryn, whose doubles partnership with Wilmer Allison
proved to be the anchoring force of the U.S. Davis Cup team from
1929 to 1936, died Aug. 7 in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Newport News, Va., in 1905, Van Ryn's doubles expertise
first attracted notice during his collegiate stint at Princeton,
where he won the U.S. tates intercollegiate doubles championship in
1927.
</P>
<P>
   Once he teamed up with the scrappy Allison, who won the
collegiate singles title that same year for his alma mater, Texas,
Van Ryn quickly distinguished himself on the Grand Slam front. He
and Allison captured the first of their four career Grand Slam
titles at Wimbledon in 1929, and successfully defended it in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   The duo also reached six U.S. finals, one short of Fred
Alexander and Harold Hackett's record seven, and they won the
national titles in 1931 and 1935.
</P>
<P>
   When Van Ryn paired with an alternate partner, George Lott, and
won the French Open and Wimbledon doubles crowns in 1931, he became
the only American man to prevail in Wimbledon's doubles
championship for three consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   Van Ryn also enjoyed a notable singles career, ranking among the
United States' top 10 from 1927 to 1932 and reaching the world top
10 in 1929 and 1931, but he got no closer to the singles title at
Forest Hills than the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   But it was on the international Davis Cup front where Van Ryn
left his greatest mark. His 14-2 record there alongside Allison was
not eclipsed until John McEnroe and Peter Fleming teamed up decades
later and accumulated a 14-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Van Ryn produced Davis Cup records of 7-1 in singles
and 22-2 in his specialty, doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Van Ryn was a prominent player in the controversial 1932 Davis
Cup showdown between France, the defending champion, and the
Americans. On a heavily watered clay court at Roland Garros, which
was intended to disturb the Americans and fortify the French, Van
Ryn and Allison defeated Henri Cochet and Jacques Brugnon to cut
France's lead to 2-1 in the five-match competition and set up a
pivotal duel between Allison and Jean Borotra.
</P>
<P>
   After losing his surprising two-set lead, Allison again nosed
ahead in the fifth set and, after squandering three match points,
began celebrating a 2-2 Davis Cup deadlock when Borotra served an
apparent double fault on the fourth match point.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the serve was ruled legal, Borotra went on to claim the
match and guarantee France its sixth straight Davis Cup
championship. Van Ryn and the rest of the dumbfounded U.S. squad
boycotted the official Davis Cup dinner that evening under orders
from Dwight Davis himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only ever heard him cuss once,'' Van Ryn said of Davis, who
inaugurated the Davis Cup competition in 1900, ``and it was then.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Ryn's Davis Cup career ended in 1936, and he was inducted
into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 62 years, Cornelia Drake Van Ryn.

UMPIRES WITHDRAW LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the umpires union shut down its lawsuit against the
National and American leagues, the union president opened the door
Tuesday for dissident umpires to return to the fight against
major-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the umpires had become splintered over the
union's mass-resignation strategy, Jerry Crawford, the union
president, appealed to the umpires in a letter asking that they
return to their solidarity position, in which they supported
``those members whose rights and jobs were attacked by baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two umpires, 13 in the National League and nine in the
American League, face the end of their careers three weeks from
Thursday, the effective date of the letters of resignation most of
them signed July 14, then rescinded July 27.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires withdrew their resignations after Judge Edmund
Ludwig of U.S. District Court in Philadelphia failed to grant them
an order protecting their jobs. The union subsequently filed unfair
labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board and
announced Tuesday that it had withdrawn the lawsuit on Monday so it
could focus on the labor board charges.
</P>
<P>
   The union announcement also said it withdrew the lawsuit because
the issues had changed since the suit was filed. The union acted
before the leagues filed a motion to dismiss the suit on the
grounds that the issues it raised belong before the labor board or
an arbitrator. The union held out the possibility that it could
refile a lawsuit next week dealing with different issues. But it is
also pressing its case before the labor board.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Phillips, the union chief, said that Susan Davis, the New
York lawyer handling the union's case, submitted a 12-page outline
of the union's case on Monday. ``We all feel that very compelling
arguments were set forth in that outline,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford set forth some strong arguments of his own in his
letter to the umpires, a copy of which was obtained by The New York
Times. As examples of union solidarity, the veteran NL umpire cited
cases involving John Hirschbeck and Joe Brinkman, the AL umpires
considered the leaders of the dissident faction, the 24 umpires who
didn't resign or rescinded their resignations in time to save their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Roberto Alomar spit on one of our members,'' Crawford
wrote, referring to Hirschbeck and a 1996 incident, ``this union
and its membership stood together in support.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Likewise, when baseball considered firing one of our members
last fall,'' Crawford continued, referring to Brinkman, ``we again
were all prepared to do what was necessary to back him.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford noted that Richie Garcia, one of the AL umpires who is
losing his job, ``said that he would walk for the guy's job.''
Later, when the AL took away Brinkman's crew-chief job, ``Garcia
vowed to give his back in support.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is ironic now,'' Crawford wrote, ``that some members who
have received the benefit of our support are now actively working
towards the destruction of this union.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford called major-league baseball ``cruel and
mean-spirited'' in its decision to accept the resignation of 22
umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an immediate purpose,'' he wrote. ``A commitment to
the 22 umpires who baseball has selectively hung out to dry. We
will not leave them hanging out to dry.''

ON BASEBALL: A NIGHT WHEN GWYNN WOULD NOT STEP UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tony Gwynn was tired. He limped from his locker to
the bathroom and back to his locker in the visitors' clubhouse at
Shea Stadium. Then Gwynn grabbed a soda and his cellular phone and
sought privacy and some reception in the third-base dugout. He
found neither.
</P>
<P>
   The phone did not work, so the chubby man with 3,004 hits sat
down. Rickey Henderson ambled across the field and hugged Gywnn,
and Gwynn told Henderson that he would be the next player to
eclipse 3,000. Bobby Valentine was a couple of steps behind
Henderson, and the Mets manager shook Gwynn's hand and then
actually reached down and kissed it.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after the usually affable Gwynn moved into a rarefied
position in baseball history, he arrived with the San Diego Padres
in the media capital of the world Tuesday. Gwynn obviously knew
that reporters would want to talk to him about his accomplishment,
and the Padres tentatively scheduled a news conference for 4:30
p.m. At 4:11, Gwynn balked. ``I've been talked out,'' Gwynn said.
``I hope you understand. I just need a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the reporters had to understand because two separate
attempts to speak with Gwynn were met with polite yet stern ``no
comments.'' Whatever Gwynn has thought about since getting 3,000
hits, whatever relief or euphoria he has experienced since reaching
what Henderson described as ``every hitter's dream'' and whatever
Gwynn felt about Jim Leyritz's recent criticism of him remained
unanswered. ``I'll do it all tomorrow,'' Gwynn said.
</P>
<P>
   That is unfortunate. Gwynn is one of the most eloquent and
cooperative players in the major leagues and it is too bad he
selected Tuesday to turn silent. Gwynn received a 60-second
standing ovation from Mets fans before he batted in the first
inning, and dozens of fans stood outside Shea four hours before the
first pitch in pursuit of his autograph. In addition, the New York
chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America selected
Gwynn as their Good Guy Award winner last year, the first time the
prestigious award was not won by a Met or a Yankee. Someone from
the Padres should have reminded Gwynn, who did not attend the
awards dinner, of that. But, instead, there was a major-league
official standing sentry near Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been interesting to hear what Gwynn thought about
Leyritz's remarks. The day before he was traded back to the Yankees
on July 31, Leyritz criticized the San Diego icon for not working
with younger players and for not staying with the team while he was
injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Tony, there have been good things and there have been bad
things,'' Leyritz told The San Diego Union-Tribune. ``As far as a
hitter, watching him day in and day out and the way he prepares
himself, it is fun to watch. But there are other things you look
for in a player. There may be intangibles that other players have
that I'd like to see in him.''
</P>
<P>
   When Leyritz was asked what sort of intangibles, he said: ``Don
Mattingly was an unselfish player. When he was on the disabled list
for a long time, he was always with the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn surmised that Leyritz was perturbed because Gwynn did not
stay with the Padres for a full game while he was disabled and they
were in Anaheim last month. The future Hall of Famer blamed the
remarks on the endless attention he received while the Padres
struggled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've kind of been sitting back waiting for somebody to say
something or do something out of frustration,'' Gwynn told the
newspaper. ``I didn't figure on him, but I'm not surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz slightly backpedaled from his comments Tuesday and said
he meant that, for him, comparing Gwynn to Don Mattingly was like
``comparing him to God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony knew how I felt about him not staying for games when he
was on the disabled list and not being around the team,'' Leyritz
said. ``To me, that didn't bother me. That's his personality. We
talked about it as a team. We didn't like it, but that's Tony's
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   The Union-Tribune quoted two players who did want their names
used as saying that Gwynn needed to listen to what Leyritz had
uttered and called Gwynn self-centered. Gwynn should be more upset
with them. At least the candid, though cocky, Leyritz spoke
publicly. But Leyritz's words were poisonous in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife has to go to the grocery store and the bank and all
she hears is: `Why does your husband hate Tony Gywnn? He says bad
things about Tony Gwynn. Why does he do that?''' Leyritz said. ``It
really made me look bad as far as taking a cheap shot going out the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, who played with Gwynn in 1996 and 1997 and who is 241
hits from 3,000, defended him as a ``good teammate'' and speculated
that Gwynn was not with the Padres when he was injured because he
was too frustrated. Before Gwynn made it to 3,000, he occasionally
felt awkward about the chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel like my teammates don't want to talk to me
because I'm locked into 3,000,'' Gwynn told The Union-Tribune.
``It's a feeling I don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   So Gwynn felt uncomfortable because someone did not want talk to
him? He should have remembered that feeling Tuesday.

EDITORIAL: CHESAPEAKE BAY'S VITAL SIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 11:
</P>
<P>
   Chesapeake Bay, one of America's most beleaguered estuaries, is
showing signs of better health this summer. Improved water quality
in some tributaries is allowing the regrowth of underwater grasses,
the striped bass have returned and the oyster population, as
recently reported in The New York Times, is on the upswing _ a big
gain for the bay because oysters act as a natural filter for
impurities in the water. Meanwhile last week an environmental group
and a timber company agreed to preserve 76,000 acres of Chesapeake
watershed lands that might otherwise have been developed.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a fragile body of water requiring constant care, and
one of the biggest threats to its health is only now being
addressed. That is the waste runoff from factory farms,
particularly the huge poultry operation in the Chesapeake
watershed. As The Washington Post noted in a series on the problem
last week, the runoff from these farms is devastating to the bay
because such waste is rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, which
encourage algae growth, choke underwater vegetation and rob aquatic
life of necessary oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive nutrients can also lead to outbreaks of toxic microbes
like pfiesteria piscicada, which in 1997 caused serious illness in
fish and humans. Agricultural runoff from the six states in the
Chesapeake Bay watershed is not a new problem, but the growth of
agribusiness has accelerated the flow of waste. The amount of
poultry manure spread over the fields adjacent to the bay in
Delaware, Maryland and Virginia as fertilizer is three times
greater than what the soil can absorb.
</P>
<P>
   The basic federal responsibility for this mess lies with the
Environmental Protection Agency. Last Friday the agency issued a
draft set of guidelines for livestock factory farms. This is a good
step, but the guidelines leave considerable authority to the
states, which vary widely in their eagerness to attack the problem.
Before the EPA puts its regulations into effect, it should devise a
set of minimum standards for phosphorus, nitrogen and other
pollutants to which all states must adhere.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is also seeking some way to fairly apportion the costs
of waste disposal and other anti-pollution programs among the major
players in the poultry industry. The big food processors have
dumped the problem on the farmers who raise the chickens. But the
farmers do not have the money to dispose of the byproducts
properly. The federal and state governments could help as well,
perhaps by underwriting new disposal techniques and by providing
subsidies to get the waste to other parts of the country where it
could be used more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration among scientists, private organizations and
the government to restore the oysters, as well as the land
acquisition agreement, could serve as models for the poultry
industry. Unless the farm runoff problem is solved, Chesapeake Bay
could take another step backward.

STRANDED FREIGHTER OFF NEW YORK FINALLY GETS ORDERS AND CARGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Ukrainian freighter that had floated in limbo in
New York Harbor for four months, without orders and at times almost
out of provisions, is scheduled to take on cargo Wednesday morning
and head off to the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The ship, the Banner of October, will pick up 260 used cars and
trucks at the Howland Hook Container Terminal on Staten Island and
then transport them to the Dominican Republic and Haiti, said
Vladimir Shamshin, U.S. representative for Azov Shipping
International, a state-owned company based in the Ukrainian port of
Mariupol.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard and the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey, which owns the Howland Hook terminal, confirmed the ship's
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The 458-foot, 3,900-ton vessel arrived in the area on April 13
after its last delivery of cars and trucks to the two countries, a
round trip it had been making every two weeks for two years,
company officials said. But the ship got caught in limbo without
pay and provisions for the 26-member crew because of the shipping
company's bureaucratic procedures and some canceled shipments.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the years I've been in business, I've never seen
something so disarrayed,'' said Louis Spano, owner of Bayway
Shipping International, an export company in Elizabeth, N.J., that
chartered the Banner of October for Wednesday's scheduled shipment.
``They're good people, just everything's got to go back to their
country. If they had a better communications system with their home
country, I think they'd be better off.''
</P>
<P>
   Bohdan Yaremenko, the Ukrainian consul in New York, conceded
that the company's rigid procedures might have contributed to the
ship's scheduling and supply problems. However, Yaremenko insisted
that the ship's problems were not symptomatic of any fundamental
financial problems with the shipping company or his government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to some financial regulations, all money that they receive
from the ship, they transfer to the Ukraine, and then the company
sends the money back, and so on and so on,'' Yaremenko said.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard inspectors who boarded the Banner of October on July
31 deemed it to be in good shape, with the crew in equally
satisfactory condition. But there was only two to three days' worth
of food on board, and the air-conditioning was not working in the
midst of a heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   A charitable group that works closely with the Coast Guard, the
Seamen's Church Institute in New York, was called upon to deliver
emergency provisions.
</P>
<P>
   But others say the ship and the company have long had trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jean R. Smith, managing director of the Seamen's Church
Institute, said Azov had left dozens of ships in dire straits
around the world. Ms. Smith said that she was satisfied that there
was a lasting supply of food on board but that she remain concerned
about the health of the crew's 23 men and three women and hoped to
board the ship Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Taras Szczur, commander of the Ukrainian-American Veterans Post
301 in Yonkers, which has sent hundreds of pounds of meat, rice and
other provisions to the ship since last week, said the post carried
out a similar mission for another Azov ship, the Mikhail Stenko, on
April 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the second time we've done that this year, the same
company, different ship,'' said Szczur, a former Marine Corps
sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Coast Guard, the Seamen's Church Institute and
the Ukrainian Consulate have begun monitoring another Azov ship,
the Viktor Talilikhin, which dropped anchor three miles off shore
on Aug. 2, after Shamshin said it returned from a delivery of cars
and trucks in the Caribbean. The ship has no orders at the moment,
he said. It received provisions on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Spano, the exporter, said he would make sure the Banner of
October was loaded and departed Wednesday. ``I'll pay the
overtime,'' he said. ``This ship has got to get out of here.''

 &HT;    Two Buckhead shooting victims out of hospital
 &HT;    By Stacy Shelton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two more Buckhead shooting victims were released from
the hospital Tuesday, and the last memorial service for one of the
nine killed has been scheduled Saturday outside St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Vancamp and Scott Manspeaker, both employees at All-Tech
Investment Group, went home Tuesday after spending 12 nights at St.
Joseph's Hospital. Four more victims remain in other hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial service is for Scott Webb, 30, a day trader who was
shot at Momentum Securities in Piedmont Center. His body was
cremated. The 2 p.m. Saturday service will be at St. Peter's
Episcopal Church in Ladue, Mo., preceded by visiting hours from 10
a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Ortman-Stipanovich Funeral Home in Creve
Coeur, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Vancamp, 38, lost her sight and will have to undergo about a
year's worth of plastic surgery, said family friend Roel Lopez. The
bullet caused entrance and exit wounds in her temple, and a second
gunshot to her chest damaged a lung and intestines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's going to have to go to school for vision impairment,
learn how to read Braille,'' Lopez said. Vancamp and her husband,
Michael Sovereign, will have to make changes to their home so she
can more easily get around.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants to go back to work but we don't know whether she'll
be able to go back to work,'' Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign and Lopez have set up a fund in Vancamp's name to help
pay costs for her rehabilitation and schooling. Donations can be
made to the Kathy Vancamp Vision Fund at NationsBank branches.
</P>
<P>
   Manspeaker, 27, is expected to fully recover. He was shot in the
abdomen and right forearm.

 &HT;    'Oh God, not again!' Atlantans share pain
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After the shootings Tuesday in Los Angeles, cameras
caught a woman scooping up a girl in a pink tie-dyed skirt, hugging
her so tightly that the child's T-shirt rode up over her shoulder
blades and her sneakered feet kicked in midair.
</P>
<P>
   All over Atlanta, parents had the same visceral impulse: to grab
their children. To clutch them close. To feel that they could be
safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You send your child off to an allegedly safe place, a place
with nursery story characters painted on the wall, and something
like this happens,'' Carey Sipp, an Atlanta author and mother of
two, said in disbelief. ``I just don't know what we're going to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been less than two weeks since Mark O. Barton killed 12
people in Stockbridge and Buckhead, including his own two children,
wounded 13 and then ended his own life with a bullet to the head;
less than three months since Anthony ``T.J.'' Solomon shot into a
crowd of 200 Heritage High School students in suburban Rockdale
County, wounding six; and less than four months since Dylan Klebold
and Eric Harris killed a teacher, 12 students and themselves at
Columbine High School in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   In his office at Emory University, gun violence researcher and
father Arthur Kellerman read reports of the L.A. shooting on the
Web. ``Oh, God,'' he said. ``Not again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad enough it was another shooting, another inexplicable
outburst of rage, another attempted mass murder. Much worse that
most of the victims were young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``To hurt a child _ that's unthinkable for most of us,'' said
Nadine Kaslow, chief psychologist at Grady Memorial Hospital. ``But
for some small group of very troubled, very angry people, that
inhibition isn't there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Atlantans, reactions to the shootings were as poignant and
identifiable as headings on a counselor's chart: disbelief,
outrage, grief, fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that goes through your mind, no matter where
you are, is: Where are my kids?'' said Dr. Philip Shayne, an
emergency physician at Grady, who treated some of Barton's victims
and whose wife is pregnant with their second child.
</P>
<P>
   At the Hamilton Mill Child Development Center in Buford, Ga.,
where an 18-month-old was kidnapped at gunpoint by a parent four
months ago, administrator Faye Miles lamented the precautions she
has to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our world was much safer'' when she started in day care 37
years ago, she said. ``Our communities were much safer. We live in
a world of strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a jaded world as well, adults worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear about things you didn't used to,'' said Lee Leonard,
whose 4-year-old attends Atlanta Cooperative Preschool. ``I hope
I'm not becoming desensitized.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Hannah Miller, a college junior working during the summer
at Inman Park Cooperative Preschool: ``As much as we think we can
protect the children in our care, there are some things we can't
protect against.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is home to some of the country's top researchers into
violence. The idea that the L.A. shootings could be dismissed as
random troubled them almost as much as the shootings themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Columbine, after Heritage High School, after Buckhead,
you wonder what is it going to take for us as a society to get off
our backsides and try to tackle this problem,'' Kellerman said.
``What will it take for us to shake off the fatalistic sense that
there is nothing we can do about this?''
</P>
<P>
   Understanding and preventing violence is Rodney Hammond's
vocation. He is a psychologist who heads the Division of Violence
Prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and
he has a grown son.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The shootings) make me feel, at a very basic level, worried
about the safety of our communities, and desperately wanting to
know something I can do to predict situations where this kind of
event would affect me or my children,'' he said. ``What nags at you
is, what would deter an incident like this? It underlines that we
need to move the discussion to prevention, to understanding some of
the causes of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houghton family, leaving the Downtown Child Development
Center with their three sons, four hours after the shootings in
L.A., couldn't begin to understand. Both parents are Europeans,
John from England and Christine from Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't see this sort of things as regularly as here,''
John Houghton said. ``The gun part of this country is amazing.
Everyone, just everyone, seems to be allowed to get a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   And so few men have other outlets, his wife added. ``There
doesn't seem to be anyone who helps them resolve their problems.
It's quite sad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans were just as dismayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being pregnant, I wonder about the society I'm bringing a
child into,'' said Dr. Tammie Quest, a Grady emergency physician.
``There's such a depersonalization. We don't relate to each other
as humans anymore; it's as though people are targets or objects.''
</P>
<P>
   Or bargaining chits, Kaslow said. ``Children are our most
precious commodity. Society pays attention when they are harmed,''
she said. ``I really think that when people are angry and hostile
and hate the world, they know they'll be most heard by attacking
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The more these shootings are televised, the more appealing that
twisted logic may become, Emory's Kellerman contended. ``It would
be hard for anyone not to argue that there's a copycat phenomenon
going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The thought that the recent shootings will continue _ and that
children could be even more at risk _ frightens both parents and
children themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 6 or 7, I didn't have to think about this stuff,
but now I have to deal with it,'' said 13-year-old Brittany
Harrington Pool. ``All this makes me more aware and makes me more
worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Evie Weinreich, who teaches at a Jewish school, was watching TV
reports of the L.A. shootings when her two sons came in from
religious camp. Tzvi, 11, and David, almost 8, knew Allen Charles
Tenenbaum, one of Barton's victims; their mother had taught his
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your heart breaks,'' she said. ``It's a horrible reflection on
society. We have to find a way to do something, or we're going to
destroy ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son asked me, `Can I go outside and play?' '' she said,
``and I hesitated.''

WILLIAM SLAYTON, 82, OFFICIAL WHO AIDED URBAN RENEWAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William L. Slayton, who moved against racial discrimination as
commissioner of urban renewal in the Kennedy and Johnson
administrations, died Saturday at Georgetown University Hospital in
Washington. He was 82 and lived in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Slayton, a Kansas-born Democrat, worked for the Housing and Home
Finance Agency and as an urban renewal expert for the Ford
Foundation before President John F. Kennedy chose him in 1961 to be
commissioner of the Urban Renewal Administration. It was part of
the Housing and Home Finance Agency, which was succeeded by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development. Slayton held the post
until 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Early in 1962 he issued a policy letter notifying 539 local
public agencies involved in urban renewal that all contracts with
private developers had to specifically include this clause:
</P>
<P>
   ``The redeveloper will comply with all state and local laws, in
effect from time to time, prohibiting discrimination or segregation
by reason of race, religion, color or national origin in the sale,
lease or occupancy of the property.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, 17 states and numerous cities had enacted measures
against discrimination in housing. But until then, local public
agencies had been required only to notify developers of the
existence of such laws and to warn them that violators would be
prohibited from further participation in urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Abrams, president of the National Committee Against
Discrimination in Housing, pointed out that the new policy did not
prevent discrimination by redevelopers in the South, where no
anti-discrimination laws existed, as long as no restrictive
covenants were employed. Slayton subsequently announced further
steps to combat racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1962, the Urban Renewal Administration announced stiffer
rules to ensure that families displaced by urban-renewal projects
were not left without decent housing. The National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People had asserted that, in eight
communities outside New York City, blacks had been displaced by
urban-renewal projects and had not been relocated satisfactorily.
</P>
<P>
   Slayton was something of a champion of the big cities. He said
in a 1964 speech that they might continue to lose people and
manufacturing to the suburbs, but they could still survive as major
cultural and entertainment areas, financial centers and special
marketing outlets.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 the Urban Renewal Administration announced that more
than 100,000 acres in 177 communities had been set aside for
recreational and scenic uses under the federal-state-local
open-space land program. Slayton said then that almost half of the
grants being issued had gone to metropolitan areas with populations
of more than 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the same year, The New York Times architecture critic Ada
Louise Huxtable wrote that recent urban-renewal and other
government-aided construction included ``some handsome buildings
and some well-planned projects, and the Urban Renewal
Administration, under its design-conscious head, William L.
Slayton, can point to some obvious, if occasionally partial,
successes.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As commissioner, Slayton was popular and widely regarded as an
able official. But he resigned in 1966, after being passed over for
two assistant secretary posts in the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, after it succeeded the Housing and Home Finance
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to become president of Urban America Inc., a
nonprofit organization in Washington concerned with the crisis in
the cities. The other posts he held in his later years included
deputy assistant secretary of state for foreign buildings.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Topeka, Kan., he received degrees in municipal
government and in public administration from the University of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include his wife of 58 years, the former Mary
Pritchard; two daughters, Betsy Slayton Campbell of Salt Lake City
and Barbara Jean Slayton Shelton of East Quogue, N.Y.; a brother,
Clarence H. Slayton Jr. of Mt. Airy, Va., and four grandchildren.

 &HT;    Boone's 4 RBIs fend off Astros
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the second consecutive game, the Braves found some
late-inning offense and another unlikely hero to beat the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on two Houston errors in the seventh inning, Bret
Boone hit a two-run double down the left field line to break a 4-4
tie. Boone, who sat out the previous game with offensive struggles,
hit a two-run homer in the first inning to help the Braves take a
3-0 lead and finished with four RBIs in the 6-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves used their fifth win in six games to keep first place
over the Mets for another day. The Braves moved to 5-1 against the
team with the best pitching numbers in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   They benefited from a pair of defensive breakdowns by the Astros
in the seventh. Shortstop Ricky Gutierrez let a Jose Hernandez
grounder scoot under his glove to start the inning. Hernandez stole
second and took third on an Ozzie Guillen sacrifice attempt. On
that play, third baseman Russ Johnson's throw to first sailed high,
giving the Braves runners at first and third with nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Boone's go-ahead hit made a winner out of Tom Glavine (10-9),
who got above .500 for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine spent the fifth inning wondering what's happening to him
this year. He had given up two singles to start the inning, then
got a double-play ball off the bat of Craig Biggio back to the
mound. But shortstop Jose Hernandez fielded his throw a few steps
from second base, failed to step on the bag and threw to first, but
the throw was late. So the bases were loaded, and Glavine proceeded
to give up three runs. Andruw Jones made another great catch on the
run to hold Derek Bell to a sacrifice fly, but the Astros had their
first lead, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine hadn't lost to the Astros since Aug. 21, 1995, going 6-0
with a 1.60 ERA in eight starts since, including his fourth win
this season on June 15 in Houston. He got a second chance when Ryan
Klesko homered off Reynolds in the bottom of the sixth inning.

 &HT;    Cowboys find positives among newcomers in OT defeat
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ If the choices are oral surgery or losing
a football game, Jerry Jones gladly will accept dental work.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Dallas Cowboys' owner flashed a hopeful smile after
Monday night's 20-17 overtime loss to the Cleveland Browns in the
Hall of Fame game. Jones saw a glimpse of the future, and some of
the players whom the Cowboys gambled on this year were better than
advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Jones singled out linebacker Dat Nguyen, receivers Wane McGarity
and MarTay Jenkins, offensive lineman Solomon Page and defensive
end Ebenezer Ekuban.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes to lose, of course, but I liked what I saw in our
first- and second-year players,'' said Jones, who takes a hands-on
approach to the draft. ``We liked what we saw in the offensive
line. Troy (Aikman) looked like he had all the time in the world to
throw the football.''
</P>
<P>
   McGarity, a former Texas Longhorn, and Jenkins have had good
summer camps, and they extended their progress to the team's first
preseason game. They combined for four catches, 80 yards and one
touchdown. Neither dropped a pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some good things that happened to this football
team (in the game),'' running back Emmitt Smith said. ``At the same
time, there were a lot of mistakes. Now that we have a game under
our belts, we can practice on correcting those mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman and backup Jason Garrett paced an offense that passed for
270 yards, but the Cowboys, who boast about offensive balance, had
only 87 yards on the ground. The only effective running back was
Chris Warren, who showed some burst while running for 21 yards on
four carries.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman showed as much rust as anybody. His early fumble set up
Cleveland's first touchdown. He later threw an interception in the
end zone to kill another drive. The Cowboys did not score when
Aikman was in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion Browns finished with 373 yards of total offense,
but most of those yards came after the starting unit left the game.
Rookie linemen Peppi Zellner and Ekuban rushed Cleveland passers Ty
Detmer and Tim Couch well at times. Nguyen, a former Texas A&AMP;M
standout who called defensive plays when he entered the game early,
had five tackles and sacked Couch with a vicious hit to the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Jones hopes this year's draft becomes a turning point for a
franchise that has been criticized for its draft in recent seasons.
Ekuban and Page, the first and second picks, were expected to do
well. But Jones said the Cowboys will receive a bonus if Nguyen,
McGarity, Zellner and Jenkins _ players taken after the second
round _ continue to make progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our division, Arizona and the (New York) Giants are going
to be better,'' Jones said, ``but I think we're going to be better,
too,'' Jones said of the NFC East, ``We had never swept the
division (8-0 record) until last season, and we feel we've improved
in some areas. We have a better pass rush, we're better in the
middle. The addition of (veteran defensive lineman) Alonzo Spellman
will help, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who return to training camp at 4 p.m. today, will
play their second preseason game Sunday afternoon in Oakland.

BAUER SAYS BUSH MOCKED TEXAS WOMAN WHO WAS PUT TO DEATH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
and R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer criticized Gov.
George W. Bush on Tuesday for making fun of an executed Texas woman
in an interview Bush gave to Talk magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is nothing short of unbelievable that the governor
of a major state running for president thought it was acceptable to
mock a woman he decided to put to death,'' Bauer said of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign aides said the Talk writer ``misread'' Bush and
said the governor never has taken the death penalty lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is portrayed in Talk as ridiculing pickax killer Karla Faye
Tucker of Houston for an interview she did with CNN broadcaster
Larry King shortly before she was executed last year. Just before
her execution date, Tucker appealed for clemency on the grounds
that she had become a born-again Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities, anti-death penalty activists and Christian
activists pressured Bush to ask the state Board of Pardons and
Paroles to grant Tucker clemency. Bush declined.
</P>
<P>
   In the Talk interview, Bush said he did not meet with any of the
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't meet with Larry King either when he came down for
it,'' Bush told the magazine. ``I watched his interview with
(Tucker), though. He asked her real difficult questions, like,
`What would you say to Governor Bush?'''
</P>
<P>
   The Talk reporter asked how she answered.
</P>
<P>
   ```Please,' Bush whimpers, his lips pursed in mock desperation,
`don't kill me,''' according to the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine went on to say no such exchange occurred between
King and Tucker in the interview that aired on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to call yourself a compassionate
conservative, you might want to look up the meaning of
compassion,'' Bauer said at a Des Moines, Iowa, news conference
four days before the Iowa straw poll of Republican presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said Bush's magazine comments were ``inappropriate,
disgusting and profoundly disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Tucker and her lover used a pickax to kill a male
acquaintance and a woman with whom he was in bed. Tucker told
police that she experienced sexual pleasure every time she drove
the ax into her victims.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Karen Hughes said Talk writer Tucker Carlson
``captured the fact that Governor Bush is a warm, down-to-earth and
engaging person, yet in several ways the writer also misread the
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Bush's decision in the Tucker case was ``difficult
and emotional.'' She said the writer ``must have misread'' Bush's
reaction to his question about Tucker's execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush did not and would not ever make fun of the
serious and difficult responsibility of enforcing the death
penalty,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer also criticized comments Bush made about abortion in the
Talk interview, which was conducted this spring and published this
month. The magazine asked Bush if the number of abortions was up or
down in Texas during his term as governor.
</P>
<P>
   ```I don't know,' he shrugs, sounding as though he genuinely
doesn't. `Probably down. Not because of anything we've done,
though. We haven't passed any laws.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, who has vowed to work for the outlawing of abortion if
elected, called Bush's comments ``cavalier,'' adding, ``I do not
believe he is serious about the sanctity of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Since granting the spring interview, Bush has signed legislation
requiring parents to be notified before their minor daughters can
receive an abortion. It takes effect Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Another unusual aspect of the Talk article is that Bush is twice
quoted as using the profanity ``f---'' in answering questions. A
third quote using the word is attributed to Bush, recounting an
exchange between him and former Texas Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, when asked about the governor's language, said: ``That's
between him and his mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said no one who was present for the interviews remembers
Bush using the foul language.

 2 Auditors Charged in Fraud Case  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday charged two former
auditors of California Micro Devices with failing to investigate
shady accounting practices by the Milpitas chipmaker.
<P>
   In an administrative action, the SEC said Michael Marrie and
Brian Berry, two auditors from the Phoenix office of the former
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand, ignored obvious irregularities in Cal Micro's
1994 financial statements, such as a write-off of about a third of
the company's accounts receivable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We allege they had red flags in front of them and didn't
respond with appropriate professional skepticism,'' said Helene
Morrison, the SEC's assistant district administrator in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Micro was the target of a series of civil and criminal legal
proceedings charging the company and several of its officers with
falsifying financial results. Last year, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Chan Desaigoudar and another executive were
convicted of securities fraud and sentenced to prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC is not accusing the auditors of being parties to the
fraud. Instead, the agency is bringing the case to reinforce the
point that auditors should act vigorously when they find evidence
of accounting irregularities, Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Perlis, a Los Angeles attorney representing Marrie and
Berry, said that the two acted appropriately, but that Cal Micro
provided them false information. ``My clients were victims of a
fraud,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The case will be heard by an SEC administrative law judge. The
two auditors, who no longer work for Coopers' successor company,
PricewaterhouseCoopers, could be censured or barred from practicing
before the SEC if they are found to have violated professional
standards.

 Salon.com Stock Plunges On News of Earnings Loss  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Salon.com, the San Francisco online magazine that went public in
June, saw its stock tumble more than 21 percent yesterday after
reporting a hefty loss in its first-ever quarterly earnings
statement.
<P>
   On a day when Internet and tech shares took a hammering almost
straight across the board, Salon's fall was particularly steep. The
company's stock closed $1.88 lower at $6.88.
</P>
<P>
   This is below Salon's initial price of $10.50 and well off its
high of $15.12.
</P>
<P>
   While the company's revenues doubled in the quarter ended June
30, it announced late Monday that losses before a special one-time
dividend payment more than tripled to $4.6 million from $1.4
million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're growing our infrastructure to be a significant content
player,'' said Todd Hagen, Salon's chief financial officer. ``It's
about us expanding our operations.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to a surge in traffic to the site, which hit 1.3
million visitors in the latest quarter, compared with 567,000 a
year earlier. Page views in the period more than doubled to 47
million.
</P>
<P>
   Salon's bruising in the market yesterday also may stem from a
perception that the company's business model, which relies heavily
on advertising for revenues, may not prove competitive in an
e-commerce-dominated world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great content isn't enough,'' said John Hannon, an analyst
with Security Capital Trading in New York. ``How are you going to
make your money?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very `nichey,' and everyone else is going mass
market,'' said Rob Martin, an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey
in Arlington, Va. ``It's all about branding, and I don't see that
Salon is branded as the go-to place on the Net for information.''
</P>
<P>
   Hold on there, countered Hagen. Although ads and sponsorship
deals accounted for about 60 percent of $1 million in quarterly
revenues, he noted that e-commerce transactions comprised 20
percent of sales, with the remainder coming from syndication,
subscription fees and book deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the foundation of this wonderful content, but we're
using it as a steppingstone stepping stone  &LR; to other revenue
sources,'' Hagen said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to discuss future earnings projections but noted
that spending will increase on marketing efforts. A TV campaign is
scheduled to debut in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Salon's total quarterly loss, including an IPO-related dividend
payment of $11.52 million ($7.20 a share) reached $16.1 million.
This may have contributed to investors' jittery feelings about the
stock, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as Salon's share price keeps heading south, some
believe the likelihood is increasing that the content-rich site
could be snapped up by a larger media enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought they make an attractive acquisition
target,'' said Friedman's Martin. ``That's still the case.''

 Linux Expo Draws Support from Intel, IBM  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Linux, the upstart free alternative to Microsoft's Windows
operating systems, continues to win endorsements from the giants of
business computing.
<P>
   At LinuxWorld Expo, a trade show and conference that opened
yesterday in San Jose, almost every major player this side of
Redmond, Wash. _ including erstwhile Microsoft allies Intel and IBM
_ pledged new support for Linux. The three-day show is expected to
draw 12,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Chairman Andy Grove put in a surprise appearance during
the conference's opening keynote, delivered by Sean Maloney, a
senior vice president at the chipmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney showed Linux running on a software simulation of Merced,
a powerful new microprocessor Intel is expected to start shipping
next year.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Intel will provide prototype Merced-based machines
so developers can write and test software for the new chip over the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   IBM said its Global Services division will offer a variety of
consulting and support programs for businesses that choose Linux.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company promised to adapt several widely used
network-management programs from its Tivoli Systems subsidiary to
run on Linux. It also said it will work to develop Linux software
with SAP, a German company that is a leading supplier of software
that corporations customize for their own applications.to develop
Linux software. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Corel, the Canadian company best known for its WordPerfect
program, previewed a new version of Linux that it plans to release
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Corel hopes to market its new version, which features easy
installation and a Windows-like user interface, for use on desktop
computers that now typically run Windows 95 or 98. So far, Linux
has succeeded mainly as an alternative to Windows NT or Unix
operating systems on large server computers.

   Oracle said it would ship WebDB 2.0 for Linux. The database
publishing program, previously available for other computer
systems, is designed for e-commerce operations and other sites that
display material stored in databases.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola Computer Group, a leader in marketing ``embedded''
computers to drive manufacturing and telecommunications systems,
unveiled a strategy under which it will offer an array of
Linux-based products and services to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Among dozens of other exhibitors, Penguin Computing, a San
Francisco company that sells hardware to run Linux, showed the
first Linux systems based on Advanced Micro Devices' Athlon, a new
high-performance microprocessor released just  &LR; this week. Penguin
demonstrated its systems running ``clustering'' software, a
technology that allows Web sites to combine multiple machines into
one large system that can keep functioning even if one of its
constituent computers fails.
</P>
<P>
   The show, held at the San Jose Convention Center, also had its
lighter notes. Images of penguins, the Linux symbol, were
everywhere, and one company, Magic Software, even showed a live and
clearly disoriented penguin at its booth every hour on the hour.
</P>
<P>
   A new nonprofit called the Linux Fund solicited customers for
its penguin-bedecked credit card, which it said is was  &LR; one of
several ways it aims to raise money to provide scholarships and
other support for open-source developers.
</P>
<P>
   Linux is distributed free online or at low cost by a variety of
companies and organizations under terms known as ``open source,''
where anyone can obtain and modify the underlying code. Last year,
it accounted for 17.2 percent of new licenses of operating software
for servers _ computers that run Web sites or provide data to
corporate networks _ according to preliminary figures from
International Data Corp.

DEVELOPERS FEEL `IMPACT' OF NEW SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By EDYTHE JENSEN  
 and KELLY PEARCE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona cities can make developers pay extra to support
construction of new schools, a judge ruled Tuesday in the first
round of a battle that could change school funding in the state.
</P>
<P>
   An official of Apache Junction, the victor in Tuesday's ruling,
immediately called upon other Arizona cities to start levying their
own school development fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for other cities to join us, to push forward so that
the larger community will benefit,'' City Manager Curtis Shook
said.
</P>
<P>
   But some civic leaders said they prefer to wait for higher court
decisions, and Peoria Mayor John Keegan _ husband of State School
Superintendent Lisa Graham-Keegan _ said it's inappropriate for
cities to levy school impact fees regardless of the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Graham-Keegan rankled school officials last month when she
testified as a witness for the home builders against Apache
Junction.
</P>
<P>
   Her spokeswoman, Laura Penny, said Keegan stands by her
testimony and has nothing more to add following Tuesday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In his 27-page decision, Pinal County Superior Court Judge James
Don wrote that schools are a ``proper public purpose'' under the
Arizona law that allows general impact fees.
</P>
<P>
   Previous legislative attempts to add school fees to state
statues have failed, and home builders argued the existing state
law prohibited them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Public schools are fundamental to a community,'' Don wrote.
``Any shortage of space for schools is ultimately a problem to the
whole community.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Skinner, whose daughter will be a first grader at Gold
Canyon Elementary School in Apache Junction, was savoring the
moment on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, she picketed the home builders outside the
courthouse in Florence. ``I'm glad he (the judge) saw the law this
way. It's refreshing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Don's decision is not the final word. Charles Herf, attorney for
the Home Builders Association of Central Arizona, is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case that is going all the way to the Arizona
Supreme Court,'' Herf said. ``The judge was well aware that the
party who did not prevail will appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   R.L. Brown, a marketing consultant for home builders, said he
was surprised and disappointed by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The developer is not going to lose one nickel out of his
pocket over this. Consumers will pay,'' Brown said. `` They'll
either pay more money for the same house or get less house for the
same money. Either way, they lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Apache Junction Mayor Douglas Coleman said without the fees,
existing residents would have to subsidize growth with higher
taxes, and that's not fair. He and Shook are hopeful the home
builders will tell Herf not to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're doing is short-sighted and against something
that's beneficial to the communities where they build houses,''
Shook said of the builders.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa resident Don Lux came to the Trend Homes development in
Apache Junction Tuesday to shop for a house in the $130,000 to
140,000 price range. He said the ruling might make him reconsider
Gilbert and Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the city's responsibility to manage their money better,''
Lux said. ``I shouldn't have to be penalized.''
</P>
<P>
   George LaRose, who bought a retirement home last week, said he
shouldn't have had to pay the school fees. ``Why should senior
citizens have to pay for someone else's kids?''
</P>
<P>
   If the home builders prevail, Apache Junction will have to
return the fees to homeowners under city law.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in Gilbert and Queen Creek said they're ready to start
looking at school development fees in light of Tuesday's ruling,
but may want to delay implementing them until the home builders'
appeals are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert, which has seen its population go from 5,000 in 1980 to
more than 100,000 today, could be a prime candidate for school
fees, Councilwoman Maggie Cathey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of education is definitely affected by growth,''
Cathey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense for us to begin looking at school impact fees
now,'' Queen Creek Councilman Scott Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Because evaluation of fees and required public hearings take
months, Queen Creek should start the process now to be ready to
implement school fees if the high courts rule in Apache Junction's
favor.
</P>
<P>
   William Farrell, attorney representing Apache Junction in the
school fee case, is also Queen Creek's municipal lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale is in the process of writing an ``adequate school
facilities'' law that could give school officials more say in the
number of developments coming into their districts.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale City Manager Marty Vanacour said Don's ruling is likely
to strengthen that city's legal position.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise Mayor Joan Shafer, whose city is in the fast-growing
Dysart School District, said, ``I've always said that if it is
declared legal to do it that we will look into it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dysart School Board publicly supported Apache Junction in
the lawsuit, and filed a ``friend of the court brief'' in Pinal
County.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first victory but we can't celebrate yet because
of strong likelihood that it will be appealed,'' Dysart
superintendent Margo Seck said.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache Junction fees, which took effect in March 1998, add
$1,368 to the cost of a new house, $366 to a new mobile home and
$276 to a new apartment unit. They bring the total city development
fees to $2,374 per house.
</P>
<P>
   That compares to Avondale's $5,495 per house, Gilbert's $4,803,
Chandler's $4,974 and Queen Creek's $7,300 per house. &QL;

 Milk Ruling May Not Lead to Watered-Down Prices  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Californians shouldn't hold their breaths waiting for milk prices
to drop, despite Monday's ruling that allows less-expensive milk to
be sold here, industry and consumer experts said yesterday.
<P>
   The state Court of Appeals in San Diego ruled Monday that
California must lift its long-standing ban on milk that fails to
meet strict state nutritional standards _ as long as the milk
complies with looser federal standards and is accurately labeled.
</P>
<P>
   California is the only state with higher standards for milk than
those mandated by the federal government. California law requires a
higher percentage of milk solids, which boosts the content of
protein and calcium. But the fortified milk also is pricier.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, if it stands, would allow both California-based and
out-of-state processors to sell cheaper, unenriched milk here, a
change that should lead to lower prices at retail.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision hardly is set in stone. The California
Department of Food and Agriculture, the defendant in the lawsuit,
is weighing an appeal to the California Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   If the high court were to accept an appeal, it easily could take
more than a year for the matter to be resolved. There is no appeal
process beyond the state Supreme Court, said Michael Vergara, the
lawyer for Shamrock Foods Co., the appellant.
</P>
<P>
   Processors are unlikely to rejigger their operations until the
legal maneuvering is completed, which means that current milk
prices and availability could remain in place for quite a while.
</P>
<P>
   But even if no appeal is made and Monday's ruling goes into
effect quickly, there is no certainty that prices will decline.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, California's muscular dairy lobby is expected to
push for legislation that would undo Monday's decision and
explicitly ban the sale of unfortified milk here.
</P>
<P>
   The California Legislature already has watered down two bills
introduced this session that would have facilitated the sale of
unenriched milk. ``We're not going to roll over easy on this one,''
said Bob Feenstra, head lobbyist for the Milk Producers Council,
which represents dairies.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is competition: It is not clear how many
out-of-state dairies are interested in entering California, the
largest milk-producing state.
</P>
<P>
   Shamrock of Phoenix, the biggest processor in Arizona, has been
fighting California regulators and processors for years. Shamrock
did business in California in the early 1990s, before it was kicked
out under an earlier court decision. But Shamrock sold milk mostly
to hotels and restaurants _ not to grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Shamrock isn't certain it could offer large
discounts because its transportation costs would be higher than
those of in-state processors, said Shamrock spokeswoman Ann Puelz
Ocana, the company's director of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers Union, an advocacy group at the forefront of the
milk-price wars, is dubious that Monday's decision will have much
of an impact on prices because milk sales continue to be dominated
by a few large supermarket chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historical and current data show most fluid milk is sold to
consumers in California at prices that are much higher than
competition would dictate,'' said Elisa Odabashian, senior policy
analyst at Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``When farm prices have gone up, retailers have raised it that
much or more. When farm prices go down, they have historically not
passed that along to consumers,'' said Odabashian.
</P>
<P>
   One change consumers can expect, if Monday's ruling remains in
effect, is a choice of both fortified and unfortified milk at
grocery stores _ a situation already enjoyed in the other 49
states.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear whether two tiers of milk would result in
lower prices. ``This opens up the possibility that supermarkets
could start charging even more for the milk we've had all along
because it provides more nutrition than the new stuff,'' said
Odabashian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think consumers are probably not going to have meaningful
gains from this, either financially or nutritionally,'' Odabashian
said. ``But I don't know, on the other hand, if they will be
greatly harmed, other than to be confused'' about the differences
between fortified and unfortified milk.

 Lucent to Buy Sunnyvale's INS For $3.6 Billion  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Lucent Technologies said yesterday that it has agreed to buy
Sunnyvale's International Networking Services for $3.6 billion in
stock, a move that will bolster Lucent's push into the growing
field of network consulting.
<P>
   INS advises companies on how to design, integrate and run
next-generation networks capable of handling voice, video and data
traffic. Buying INS will allow Lucent to move beyond selling gear
to companies and into helping businesses select, install and use
the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent of New Jersey will pay 0.8473 share, or about $54, for
each share of INS, about a 14 percent premium over Monday's closing
price.
</P>
<P>
   INS said no layoffs were planned for its 2,200 employees, about
700 of whom are in California. In fact, the company said it plans
to hire an additional 1,000 engineers.
</P>
<P>
   INS will become part of Lucent's NetCare division. NetCare,
which currently has 3,300 employees who provide support to Lucent
customers, will be based in Sunnyvale and headed by INS President
and Chief Executive Officer John Drew.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers said the acquisition will help Lucent as it
looks for ways to get a leg up on competitors such as Cisco Systems
and Nortel Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent and its competitors are in a race to provide gear to
companies that want to build state-of-the-art networks. Phone
companies, financial institutions and other businesses are looking
for ways to integrate their voice and data networks so that they
can offer new services and save money by routing traffic more
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Before doing this, however, many businesses look to companies
like INS for help designing, building and maintaining a network.
INS recommends what type of equipment to buy, how to deploy a
network and provides continuing support.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much new technology coming to market, and from the
customer's point of view, it's an incredibly difficult challenge in
being able to assess and identify the right products to give them
the solutions they need,'' said Michael Davies, an analyst with
Punk, Ziegel &AMP; Co. in New York. ``If Lucent's able to provide a
company with a road map, it gives Lucent an advantage over its
competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   INS, which has clients ranging from Microsoft to Compaq, also
will give Lucent access to a broad and lucrative customer base. The
network services industry is growing at a fast clip, and sales are
expected to reach $90 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the relationship between INS and Lucent may be a bit tricky
because INS recommends all types of gear to companies, not just
Lucent products.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, INS has had a strong relationship with Cisco, which
owns about 8 percent of INS.
</P>
<P>
   Drew of INS said the company's relationship with Cisco will
change significantly, but he added that the NetCare unit will be
``objective'' when recommending vendors and won't hesitate to
suggest Cisco products if that's the best route.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to continue to recommend the best network,
regardless of who makes the equipment,'' said Drew. ``Lucent
recognizes this and was bold enough to make this move.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew said a deal with Cisco didn't materialize because the San
Jose networking giant doesn't want an internal network support
group. Instead, Cisco farms out its network support to companies
like INS.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Cisco said it was investing $1 billion in KPMG, the
accounting firm, to offer more online and networking services to
businesses. Industry watchers said wind of Lucent's pending deal
with INS probably pushed Cisco to make the investment.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Russo, an executive vice president with Lucent, said Lucent
did a deal with INS because of the company's expertise in the
network services area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customer demand for this kind of capability has been
outstripping our ability to provide services,'' Russo said.
``Service and support is a core part of the value that we bring to
our customers, and you can't be a leader ... without a coherent
networking services strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Pyykkonen of CIBC World Markets, said INS, which has
expertise in a technology called Internet Protocol, also will help
Lucent with its recent acquisition of Nexabit Networks. IP is a
standard for moving voice, video and data in packets across
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Nexabit makes high-speed switches that move data traffic on
telecommunications networks. Lucent agreed to pay nearly $900
million in stock for Nexabit last June.

 SGI to Cut Jobs, Sell Cray Unit  
 By Tom Stein 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Silicon Graphics Inc., a foundering maker of computer
workstations, said yesterday that it will slash jobs, dramatically
restructure its business, sell off its Cray supercomputer unit and
enter a series of strategic alliances as part of a wide-ranging
recovery plan.
</P>
<P>
   SGI said it will redefine its focus to concentrate on high-end
servers to deliver rich content, such as video, over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   SGI employs about 9,000 workers, one-third of them at its
Mountain View headquarters. The company said it plans to cut
anywhere from 1,000 to 1,500 jobs and reassign an additional 1,500
employees as it spins off large chunks of its business and forms
new joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kelly, a senior vice president at SGI, said the layoffs
largely will come from sales, marketing and administrative areas.
He said SGI plans to cast a smaller geographical net as it focuses
almost exclusively on its 200 biggest customers.
</P>
<P>
   That will mean closing offices around the world and
consolidating the sales force. ``Today, we operate in 30-plus
countries,'' Kelly said. ``We don't need to be in all those
places.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said some SGI Mountain View employees also would be
targeted for downsizing. Restructuring has become a way of life at
SGI, which first began its turnaround efforts more than a year ago.
An industrywide slowdown in the supercomputer and server computer
markets have hampered past initiatives. SGI's stock has fallen
about 49 percent during the past five years, while the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index has almost tripled and the S&AMP;P computer index has
risen sixfold.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its current restructuring plans, SGI will:
</P>
<P>
   _Sell its Cray division, which makes supercomputers that are
used primarily by the scientific community. SGI purchased Cray in
1996 for $740 million, but analysts said the company was unable to
grow the operation.
</P>
<P>
   _Create a new business unit that will focus on making Internet
appliances that can deliver streaming media applications, such as
movies-on-demand, to the consumer market. SGI chief executive Rick
Belluzzo said more than 90 million households now have superfast
connections to the Internet and are waiting for systems that can
deliver complex video and voice files to their personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   _Form a new joint venture to manage SGI's line of lower-end
workstations that run on the Windows NT platform. Analysts said SGI
has failed to penetrate this market and is looking to a partner,
such as Dell Computer Corp., to assume responsibility for the
business and to rustle up new customers.
</P>
<P>
   _Move away from proprietary chips and operating systems for its
computer workstations. Instead of building these features itself,
SGI said future workstations will sport Intel chips and the Linux
operating system. SGI's workstations are famous for their roles in
the creation of such films as ``Jurassic Park,'' ``A Bug's Life''
and the recently released ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut.''
</P>
<P>
   SGI said both software developers and the world at large are
adopting Linux at record rates. By supporting Linux, SGI believes
that its computers will be much more attractive to potential
customers. There are 1 million new Linux users every month,
according to SGI.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are focused on building a strong foundation and putting the
company back on the path of profitability,'' said Belluzzo. After
seven consecutive losing quarters, SGI finally posted a net profit
of $158 million on revenue of $829 million for the fourth quarter
of fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The investment community, however, reacted negatively to the
news. SGI's stock fell 23 percent, to $12.44, in yesterday's
trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed the market reacted the way it did,'' said
SGI's Kelly. ``But that does not put into question the value of
what we are doing. We are not (restructuring) for the short-term
stock pop.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, analysts believe that SGI might be heading down the
right road. By spinning off Cray and its NT workstation divisions,
as well as phasing out its own chip and operating system
development efforts, the company can concentrate on the more
successful parts of its business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top line is that SGI wanted to be a competitive producer
of everything from supercomputers to high-end server to commodity
Intel workstations, and that didn't serve them well,'' said Matthew
Nordan, an analyst at Forrester Research. ``They've decided to
focus on core competency instead, and I think that will yield them
some long-term gains.''
</P>
<P>
   But some SGI employees worry that the latest round of layoffs
and restructuring may be a case of too little, too little.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the kind of painful decisions that should have been
made two or three years ago,'' said one SGI worker. ``I guess it's
better that it's being done now rather than never. We've really
been spread thin for a long time.''

BRADLEY BETTING ON `RACE UNITY' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LORI RODRIGUEZ 
and ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley told
blacks gathered Tuesday in Houston that he is banking his White
House chances on the belief that most Americans yearn to close the
racial divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Race unity is not a political position for me, it's who I am
and what I believe,'' the former New Jersey senator told the annual
conference of the National Urban League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm staking this presidential campaign on the conviction that
way over 50 to 60 percent of the American people, including white
Americans, want to move ahead to a brighter day when people are
seen not by the color of their skin or the shape of their eyes but
by who they are; that people yearn for the same racial harmony and
unity that I do.''
</P>
<P>
   In a low-keyed speech laced with personal accounts of his
childhood, Bradley criticized the Clinton administration for
failing to sufficiently move children, minorities and the homeless
out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``After seven years of a Democratic administration the
percentage of American children living in poverty has barely
blipped down,'' said Bradley, who is Vice President Al Gore's only
competition for their party's presidential nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year after the welfare reform bill, which I voted against,
there was a 29 percent increase of children living in deep poverty.
That's half the poverty level.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a former New York Knicks basketball star and Rhodes
scholar, was warmly introduced by league Executive Director Hugh B.
Price as ``a white guy who can jump and is a straight shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was the third candidate in as many days to troll for
votes among the 4,000 conferees meeting at the George R. Brown
Convention Center in Houston. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
front-runner for the Republican nomination, welcomed the group
Sunday night; Gore, the Democratic front-runner, addressed a Monday
luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley repeatedly jabbed at the Clinton-Gore
administration, the vice president in his speech deplored the same
litany of social ills, including the high number of uninsured
children, the dire need for better schools and persistent crimes of
hate.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did score with warm accounts of his childhood in Crystal
City, Mo., ``a small town of 3,492 people on the banks of the
Mississippi River.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a town that had 96 in my high school graduating class
and one stop light. It was a multiethnic, multiracial factory town;
a town where the Little League was integrated before the schools
were integrated,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a town where as a Little League baseball player in
regional playoffs, we stayed in third-rate motels because the
African-Americans on our team couldn't stay in the first-rate
hotels and the rest of us weren't going to leave our teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, Bradley said, he asked his father, who worked
his way up from a starting position at the small town bank to
majority shareholder of the bank, of what he was most proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said the proudest moment was that, throughout the Great
Depression, he never foreclosed on a single home,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other bit of wisdom he conveyed was that you could never
tell by a person's skin color how they were going to repay their
loans; that character was important and was found everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the future of white Americans is inextricably bound
to the future of the non-white Americans who will constitute a
majority of the work force in the new millennium, Bradley took
another poke at President Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why have our leaders waited just until recently to even use
the word `poverty,' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This I know for sure: Timid leadership and the silence of good
people have caused us to risk losing yet another generation; a
generation that won't participate or benefit from the new economy
that is emerging. ''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is morally unacceptable and economically perilous to
continue this course.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bradley campaigned to about 125 Houston Democrats at a
reception in the foyer of the Ensemble Theater near downtown.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is seeking the Democratic nomination ``in a little
different way'' by running a grass-roots operation and knocking on
voters' doors in key primary states such as Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds like a city council race in Houston, doesn't it?'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bradley was escorted to the event by Houston Councilman
Carroll Robinson, one of the first elected officials in the country
to endorse Bradley over Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Answering the audience's questions about policy issues, Bradley
said most of the federal budget surplus should be used to pay down
the federal debt. That would have a bigger impact on the national
economy than the tax cuts being favored by Republicans, he said. If
tax cuts are offered at all, they should go first to the poorest
taxpayers, he continued.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign staff billed the meeting as a conversation
with black preachers and minority leaders. But after the local
Democratic Party invited any and all of its supporters, the meeting
produced a mostly white audience. Several people said they came to
check out Bradley and decide if they will vote for him or Gore in
the March primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's remarks at the Urban League came a few hours after a
gunman opened fire in the lobby of a suburban Los Angeles Jewish
Community Center, wounding five people, including three young boys
attending day camp. That prompted a repeat of his pledge to ban the
sale of cheap guns known as ``Saturday night specials'' if elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time somebody stood up to the National Rifle
Association,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   The 89th annual league, which ends today, will hold a town
meeting this morning called ``The Police and People of Color: Can't
we all just get along?''
</P>
<P>
   Among those scheduled to participate is lawyer Johnnie Cochran,
who defended O.J. Simpson in his murder trial, activist Al Sharpton
and Mayor Lee Brown, a former police chief.

GROW A BUSINESS/PETER SINTON 
</HEADLINE>
 _ SF CHRON   Landing VC Cash for A Startup 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: I am developing an Internet business and am interested in
getting venture capital financing. But I have neither a startup
track record nor financial contacts. Can you provide some
suggestions?
<P>
   A: There are a number of books and Web sites that dispense
information on venture capital (private equity from institutional
investors) and angel capital (money from wealthy individuals).
Venture Capital Resource Library (www.vfinance.com) has news about
recent deals, links to dozens of venture capital firms and
information about their investments, areas of focus and partners.
</P>
<P>
   Another place to start is www.garage.com, which has practical
information about writing business plans and winning venture
capital as well as links to other sites.
</P>
<P>
   Articles and Web sites typically tout success stories and
virtues of venture capital. What they often don't say is how
incredibly difficult it is to win millions of dollars of venture
capital backing and ultimately graduate to the public markets with
a successful IPO.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Mayfield Fund of Menlo Park reviews approximately
4,000 startup ideas each year before funding 20 or 30. That means
only half a percent to three-quarters of 1 percent of applications
get accepted, which is a tougher admissions policy than Stanford or
Harvard. And only about half of those that win financing ever
graduate to the public markets or get acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Located on Sand Hill Road, the Wall Street of private equity
financing, Mayfield and its competitors are bombarded by business
plans. Mayfield General Partner Kevin Fong figures that he and 13
other partners go through 20 pitches a week, about double the
number they received three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He offers these pointers to those seeking VC dollars:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Executive summaries &LR; . Make the executive summary of your business
plan short and compelling, no more than two to 10 pages. Fong says
he and his colleagues take one to 15 minutes to decide whether an
idea makes the first cut. You will need to clearly define your
innovative product and its market potential, your management team,
key risk factors and what you need to do to create a success.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Think big &LR; . Blue-chip venture capital firms are interested in
paradigm shifts, killer apps and liquidity events (such as going
public). They want to stretch their invested time and millions of
dollars into billions. Me-too technology or ideas with limited
commercial potential are destined for the waste basket or delete
key.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested in innovation and large opportunities,'' says
Fong. Mayfield, whose investment portfolio includes 3Com, Compaq
and Genentech, recently closed its 10th venture capital fund with
$450 million from institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Connections &LR; . The venture capital community is not an old boys'
club. (There are a lot of young guys, too, and a few women.) But
connections do help. Fong says his firm's comfort level is higher
if entrepreneurs are referred by Mayfield's network of
entrepreneurs, portfolio companies, service firms and friends. More
than 90 percent of companies that win financing from Mayfield go
this route.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Making contact &LR; . Do homework to find out which firms and partners
deal with your product or technology. Write or e-mail your
executive summary, and then let a few days go by before calling to
set up a meeting. If you are smart and lucky, you might get in the
door.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the questions Fong and other VCs will be
asking:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Does the company have a strong management team in place or will
the investors have to do the job themselves while they look for key
managers?
</P>
<P>
   _What kind of business model does the company have? Is it a
known/proven model or one that has not been tried before?
</P>
<P>
   _Is the market the company is going to enter an existing market?
If so, is it growing or shrinking? If it is a new market, does it
have the potential to be large?
</P>
<P>
   _How much technology risk is associated with the success or
failure of the company?
</P>
<P>
   _How would you use the VC? What unique contribution will the VC
provide in terms of strategy, people and a network of possible
partners?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
VC FOR WOMEN: Springboard 2000, the first venture capital
conference for women entrepreneurs, is scheduled for Jan. 27, 2000,
at the Oracle Conference Center in Redwood City. Sponsored by the
National Women's Business Council and Forum for Women
Entrepreneurs, the event will let 25 West Coast female
entrepreneurs present their business plans to angel, venture and
corporate investors.
</P>
<P>
   The event seems well timed. Although women are starting
businesses at twice the rate of men, VentureOne says only 4 percent
of the information technology companies that receive VC financing
have a female CEO. For more information on the conference, call
(650) 357-0222 or call up www.springboard2000.org.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Startups Fetch Record Financing  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Kestrel Solutions, a Mountain View company named for an agile
falcon, landed the biggest venture capital investment of any Bay
Area company in the second quarter _ $55.5 million.
<P>
   Meanwhile Pets.com, a San Francisco online retailer of pet food
and other supplies, got its paws on $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The two were among 227 Bay Area companies that attracted more
than $2 billion in venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   Although the public's appetite for anything Internet may be
starting to slow, the financing of startups with a high-tech twist,
and perhaps a catchy name, still continues at a torrid pace.
Venture capital firms poured a record $6.8 billion into emerging
U.S. companies in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That was a whopping 46 percent more than VCs invested in the
first three months of 1999, according to VentureOne, a San
Francisco venture capital research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first six months of 1999, venture capital firms
invested $11.4 billion, or nearly 90 percent of the record $13
billion they invested during all of 1998,'' said Jean Yaremchuk,
vice president of research and technology at Venture One. ``And
last year was a record year.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Bay Area is the center of the venture capital
volcano. In the three months ended June 30, 227 local companies
received nearly double the $1.2 billion that 183 local startups
received in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The average investment jumped to nearly $9.4 million from $6.6
million as Internet and other companies required more capital to
grow quickly and build market share before competitors beat them to
it. Twenty-nine local companies received at least $20 million each
in venture financing, compared with 20 in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hottest Internet area is business-to-business services,''
said Mayfield Fund General Partner Kevin Fong. This includes making
communications connections, conducting financial transactions,
advertising, marketing, maintaining data files and tracking online
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Kestrel Solutions, a Mountain View fiber optic systems
developer, has raised more than $80 million over the past two
years, including $55.5 million during the past quarter from private
investors that included former Secretary of Defense Frank
Carlucci's Carlyle Group and BankAmerica Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Meldon Gafner said Kestrel Solutions' patented
technology allows it to pack 64 signals onto a single strand of
fiber optic cable instead of one. Kestrel's goal is to increase the
capacity of metropolitan communications networks without having to
dig up the streets to lay more cable.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies that raised major amounts of cash in the past
quarter include:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Pets.com  &LR; _ This San Francisco online provider of pet food,
supplies and information received $50 million in June from
Amazon.com, Bowman Capital and Hummer Winblad Venture Partners.
Pets.com CEO Julie Wainwright hopes to make her company the
Amazon.com of online pet supplies and is using the marketing
prowess of the No.1 Internet retailer, including Web page links and
e-mail access to its 10.7 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Although about 35 percent of its current sales are dog food and
25 percent are cat food, Pets.com picks, packs and ships 12,000
products, ranging from the $5.69 Ferret Spongie Jumper to the $4.99
Repti Cage Carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Competition in the online pet category is heating up. Another
San Francisco startup that is going after the $23 billion-a-year
U.S. pet food and supply business is Petopia.com. The company
received $66 million in July from two strategic partners _ a unit
of France's Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton and Petco, one of the
largest U.S. pet supply retailers.
</P>
<P>
   To wean customers from their neighborhood pet stores, both
Pets.com and Petopia are striving to establish online communities
where pet owners can chat and find information and free advice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Tavolo.  &LR; Formerly known as Digital Chef and located in St. Helena,
this online retailer of gourmet food and cooking products changed
its name to the Italian word for table last weekAug.4 &LR;  and migrated
to San Rafael. The online company, which was started last year to
provide everything for cooks, raised $35 million in the past
quarter. It stocks 5,000 items online as well as menus and other
information,
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Virtual Vineyards &LR; . This Palo Alto online retailer raised $30
million to establish a network of wholesalers and retailers to ship
wine legally to most U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Google Inc. &LR;  This next-generation Palo Alto Internet search engine
company raised $25 million from blue-chip VC firms that included
Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers and Sequoia Capital. Stanford
computer science graduates Sergey Brin and Larry Page started the
company last year and named it after the giant number ``googol,''
which is 1 followed by 100 zeros.
</P>
<P>
   Most venture capital investors hope to cash out of their
investments eventually when their offspring go public or get
acquired.
</P>
<P>
   According to Deloitte &AMP; Touche, 158 companies went public in the
second quarter of 1999, including a record 90 Internet-related
companies. The average seven-day price increase for these Internet
stocks from their offering price was an incredible 76 percent,
compared with just 18 percent for non-Internet IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   However, the tide seems to have turned, as many of the biggest
Internet stocks have taken major hits in the market since July.
Several recent Internet IPOs have performed poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Some, such as 1-800-Flowers.com, Quotesmith.com and Quokka
Sports, actually started trading below their offering prices. But
several other Internet-connected IPOs, including Chemdex, Packeteer
and Internet Capital Group (which invests in Internet startups),
still soared on their first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield Fund's Fong acknowledges that some Internet stocks may
have shot up simply because they had a ``dot com'' in their name.
But he believes that ``e-commerce is here to stay'' and sees some
market softening as a healthy sign. ``I want the public markets to
be more selective; it's not good if companies go out too early and
disappoint investors.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Just moments after the shooting at the day camp
in Los Angeles' north San Fernando Valley, frantic parents deluged
day-care centers across the San Fernando Valley with calls while
the centers locked their doors and arranged to send children home.
</P>
<P>
   City park and recreation programs near the shooting also took
emergency measures to ensure the safety of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some lunatic is loose, who knows if somebody could come
here,'' said a father as he picked up his daughter Tuesday at the
Bernard Milken Jewish Community Center in the West Hills community.
``We have no idea what this guy could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Rouss, executive vice president of Jewish Community Centers
of Los Angeles, said officials have stepped up security at their
other 12 sites in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Unsure whether the gunman was targeting Jewish centers, the
Bernard Milken campus, a sister faclity of the North Hills Jewish
Community Center, asked the Los Angeles police to send officers and
called parents to pick up children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are horrified. We are saddened by this,'' said Jack Mayer,
executive director of The Jewish Federation/Valley Alliance in West
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   At Children's Wonderland in the Warner Center in the Woodland
Hills community of the Valley, a secular day-care center, officials
canceled parent tours of the facility, locked all doors that led
onto the street and kept children indoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not allowing anybody inside the premises who doesn't
belong here,'' said Mary Willoughby, assistant director of the
center, which received dozens of calls from alarmed parents.
</P>
<P>
   Willoughby said it will take a long time to recover from the
emotional fallout. ``The teachers are a little uneasy; the parents
are uneasy; we're all emotionally upset,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Soboroff, president of the city's Recreation and Parks
Commission, said all nearby parks and recreation centers
immediately went into an emergency operation after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it's no in-no out,'' Soboroff said. ``Any kids who
are in a program are immediately taken care of, and we don't let
any people in the buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Steve Tucker of Temple Ramat Zion in Northridge said
children in day care were moved to a locked area and parents called
to take them home.
</P>
<P>
   At Temple B'Nai Hayim Children's Center in Sherman Oaks,
officials hustled their 20 charges indoors as soon as they heard
the news. ``We took children inside right away, and we stayed away
from the windows,'' said Tatyana Ingel, head teacher of the
temple's preschool.
</P>
<P>
   At Temple Beth Hillel, a reform congregation in North Hollywood,
officials considered hiring a security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish temples and preschools in the Simi Valley and Thousand
Oaks areas north of Los Angeles opted to stay open following
Tuesday's shooting.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer was stationed at Congregation B'Nai Emet in
Simi Valley until the 18 children at the Reform temple's summer day
camp went home for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no threat, no reason to believe there will be any
problems,'' police Sgt. Bob Gardner ``They were just feeling a
little uncomfortable.''

CISCO SYSTEMS' 50 PERCENT SALES GAIN HELPS IT TOP EARNINGS
ESTIMATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Cisco Systems Inc., the world's No. 1
beneficiary of the continuing Internet buildup, reported a nearly
50 percent gain in fourth-quarter sales and earnings Tuesday,
beating Wall Street estimates by a penny a share.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco executives said large corporate networks, its traditional
market, now accounted for slightly less than half of revenue.
Growth is coming from telecommunications service providers
upgrading their networks to offer combined voice and data lines, as
well as from small business customers adding Internet connections
and internal networking.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco reported its results after the close of the market, with
its shares settling at $58.75, down $1.0625, in NASDAQ trading.
Shares rose to $60.875 in after-hours trading. Analysts said the
results were essentially in line with expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco is now the No. 1 or 2 company in every market it sells in
and has been gaining market share from all its traditional
competitors, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   For its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended July 31, Cisco
reported pro forma earnings, excluding acquisition-related charges,
of $727 million, or 21 cents a diluted share, up 38 percent from
$525 million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 48
percent, to $3.55 billion, compared with $2.40 billion a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Cisco to report earnings of 20 cents a
share, not including one-time items, according to the First Call
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, Cisco completed the acquisition of Amteva
Technologies Inc., an Internet services company, for approximately
$159 million and took a one-time charge of $81 million. Cisco
completed the acquisition of Geotel Communications, a software
maker, and incurred related costs of approximately $16 million.
</P>
<P>
   Actual earnings, including these charges was $635 million, or 18
cents a diluted share, compared with $493 million, or 15 cents a
diluted share, in the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``By providing the systems that make the Internet work, Cisco is
playing a major role in helping customers thrive in the explosive
Internet economy,'' John Chambers, the president and chief
executive, said in a statement. ``As a result, we are growing
faster than all of our key competitors and have been the
fastest-growing and most profitable company in the history of the
computer industry.''
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Cisco had earnings of $2.10 billion, or 62 cents a
diluted share, compared with $1.35 billion, or 42 cents a share for
fiscal 1998.

DOLE MAKES HER CASE IN IOWA AS WOMAN IN PIONEERING ROLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST DES MOINES, Iowa _ When Elizabeth Dole walked into a
community center Tuesday, the Republican presidential candidate
immediately launched into her well-rehearsed routine.
</P>
<P>
   She talked about sexism at Harvard Law School when she attended
the Ivy League institution in the 1960s. One professor had a
designated ``ladies' day,'' she said, when female students were
grilled in front of their classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Dole then related how several years later she won her first case
against a male prosecutor who was first in her class at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   By offering up these autobiographical tidbits, Dole hoped to
reinforce her credentials as a pioneering woman who has been
successful in her many endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   And campaigning this week in Iowa, Dole is banking on a resume
that includes several Cabinet posts and a stint as head of the
American Red Cross to bolster her chances in the first presidential
test this Saturday in the straw poll in Ames.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have 30 years of service to the public,'' she told the
crowd. ``I am not a seat warmer.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the candidate has denied that her gender alone should
be the deciding factor, the female factor inevitably makes it into
her carefully crafted speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next president, whoever SHE may be ... '' she repeatedly
tells audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the novelty of her effort and her impressive
credentials, Dole's campaign does not appear to be taking off.
Polls indicate she is falling further and further behind
front-runner George W. Bush. She has suffered from lackluster
fund-raising and poor organization.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say she failed to capitalize on the initial burst of
publicity after her resignation from the Red Cross last winter. And
Dole was even undercut by her husband, former Senate Republican
leader and 1996 presidential nominee Bob Dole, who said earlier
this year he might contribute to the campaign of one of his wife's
rivals, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Dole also has predicted nothing
more encouraging for his wife than that there will be a Republican
president.
</P>
<P>
   While the former senator was back on the campaign trail last
week stumping for his wife, he may not have helped her cause. He
told one group his wife was not present because she was ``getting
her hair fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   While she draws large crowds, political observers are not clear
whether the many women who have come to hear her will participate
in the GOP primary rituals, including the straw poll in Ames this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Dole said she is not terribly concerned about the event's
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   While she dutifully asks her audiences to help her in Ames, she
also played down the significance of the straw poll, arguing that
its importance has been hyped by the media.
</P>
<P>
   Dole also said that her lackluster fund-raising is not a
disadvantage. ``The landscape is strewn with politicians with a lot
of money who didn't cross the finish line.''
</P>
<P>
   While she never mentioned Bush's impressive war chest, she noted
three other Texans who had a lot of money: Phil Gramm, Ross Perot
and John Connally, who never made it to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Dole first captivated the nation with her Oprah-style
performance during the 1996 Republican National Convention. And on
the campaign trail she has perfected a variation of that
much-watched performance. At each event, the perpetually smiling
candidate wanders out among her audience without notes and with a
microphone pinned to her blouse.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to specific issues, the candidate steers clear of
controversy and sticks to mainstream GOP positions, although
earlier in the campaign she staked out unique ground among GOP
candidates in calling for certain gun controls. She tells audience
that taxes need to be cut, wasteful spending eliminated and defense
spending increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pentagon has been reduced to a triangle. We have to build
it back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She called for a crackdown on drugs and for shipping federal
dollars back to the states for education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe you can manage schools by remote control from
Washington,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole shied away from the more controversial social issues that
have divided her party. Only in response to a specific question
does she reply that she opposes abortion except in the case of
rape, incest or if the pregnancy endangers the mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's candidacy clearly appeals to some women who believe that
gender makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time we have a woman president,'' said Christine
Holub, 23, who came to hear Dole at the West Des Moines Community
center.
</P>
<P>
   Holub said she was so excited about the candidate that she
dragged her mother to the forum.
</P>
<P>
   But Holub's mother, Pam Nelson, said she was not yet sold on
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid a woman cannot be elected president,'' said Nelson,
53, who added that she thinks Bush has a more realistic chance of
winning back the White House for the GOP.

SUMMER OF DISCONTENT FOR TOLEDO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bob Toledo recalls he was 12 years old when he
first cast a covetous eye on a career in coaching. By 17 he was
coaching a Pop Warner team in San Jose. He did it because it was
fun.
</P>
<P>
   Now Toledo is on the stout side of 50, warden of a rambunctious
UCLA football program, dealing with an increasingly complex college
sports world. And insisting the job remains fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always fun,'' he says over a lunch-time pasta. ``I still
have a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   To which one wants to reply: When, sir, did you realize you're a
masochist? Who but a glutton for punishment would consider this a
good time?
</P>
<P>
   Consider what passed for Toledo's summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   It's July and his only headache concerns the planning of his
daughter Alissa's wedding. Then the phone rings at his big new
house on a golf course in Westlake Village. UCLA athletic director
Peter Dalis is calling to say, ``We have this problem...''
</P>
<P>
   So begin weeks of embarrassment and disappointment _ Toledo's
words _ over the revelation that nine UCLA players used
handicapped-parking placards illegally.
</P>
<P>
   The infractions lead to suspensions. So that, as the Bruins
prepare to begin practice this week, Toledo faces opening games
against Boise State Sept. 4 and high-ranked Ohio State Sept. 11
without all three starting linebackers and the team's only two
veteran offensive linemen _ and faces the near-certainty that the
glories of 20 consecutive victories and two Pacific-10
championships in the past two seasons will not be relived anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
   To the parking mess, add the shock over
quarterback-of-the-future J.P. Losman's abrupt departure after 10
weeks at UCLA, and Toledo says ``it's probably the worst vacation I
ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   As if the work year wasn't rough enough, the 10-0 start and
national-championship contention having exploded in a hail of Miami
and Wisconsin touchdowns, an end-of-season collapse that was
followed by an FBI points-shaving probe centering on a few Bruins'
apparent association with an undesirable with the a.k.a. Donny
Shacks.
</P>
<P>
   At least, you imagine, people are understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. Before the suspensions were announced in the parking
case, Toledo heard from people who assumed he'd make sure the
players wouldn't miss the Ohio State game. And now, he hears from
people who figure he made sure the players !ital!would!off! miss
the Ohio State game to provide an excuse for losing.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it's an insult to his integrity, precisely the kind
of cynicism Toledo claims to detest.
</P>
<P>
   He prides himself on a (relatively) clean program, and believes
the summer scandal does more damage to UCLA's image than it might
do on a campus with a lesser reputation.
</P>
<P>
   He delivers a long sheet of dos and don'ts to his players each
season, including polite suggestions about whether to avoid bar
fights (do) and whether to park in the blue spaces (don't). He
posts newspaper accounts of other universities' misdeeds on the
locker room bulletin board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to remind them that they're not typical students, they're
high-profile people, and when they do something wrong, it's going
to hit the papers,'' said Toledo, who thinks of himself as a father
with three daughters and 105 sons. ``I constantly remind them not
to do anything to embarrass themselves and the program. It used to
be you could get in a fight and nobody cared. Things have
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   A cynic suggests it's easier to win if you do bend a few rules.
Toledo won't hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more upset at this than losing the Miami game.
Discipline and these principles mean more to me than winning a
football game,'' he insists. Besides, following the rules ``makes
for an easier atmosphere. It makes the job easier for the coach.
You don't have to go around playing cop and scolding people.''
</P>
<P>
   When Toledo was 17, coaching meant teaching. Today, with the
NCAA limits on practice time and contact with recruits, he feels
more like a corporate CEO than a mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have very little opportunity to coach the players. I coach
the (assistant) coaches,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He appears to be laughing, not complaining, when he says that.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, nobody wants to hear a man making $578,000 in the first
year of a seven-year contract complain. So Toledo talks about how
coaching is ``harder'' nowadays, but he won't admit it's not as
fun.
</P>
<P>
   He'll never convince us. But if he's lucky he'll convince
himself. &QL;

SOME VICTIMS RETURN HOME AS BOY FIGHTS FOR LIFE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The spray of bullets fired by the gunman inside
the Jewish Community Center left a 5-year-old boy fighting for his
life and wounded two other boys, a teen-age camp counselor and a
68-year-old receptionist, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Isabelle Shalometh, the center's receptionist from the North
Hills community in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, was the first
person to see the gunman as he walked through the lobby doors and
began firing. Yet she avoided serious injury with bullets grazing
her left arm and back, said her daughter, Lucille Shalometh Goldin.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's front and center, right there. She saw him coming at her
and he just started firing,'' said Shalometh Goldin, of Calabasas
on the western edge of the San Fernando Valley. ``She knew enough
to get down and crawl into the back office.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother was hospitalized in good condition and was released
in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to release the names of the other victims.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-year-old boy attending the center's day camp suffered
bullet wounds in the stomach and leg that left him in critical
condition. He underwent more than six hours of surgery in a
``minute-by-minute'' battle for his life and was later listed in
fair condition, said officials at Providence Holy Cross Medical
Center in Mission Hills in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had such extensive injuries. He's been very resilient,''
said Linda Coale, a hospital spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old camp counselor suffered two bullet wounds to her
right leg and was in stable condition at Kaiser Permanente Medical
Center in Woodland Hills, said spokeswoman Lisa Kort.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-year-old boy, flown by helicopter to Children's Hospital Los
Angeles, was in fair condition after doctors removed a bullet from
his left buttock and treated his lower leg for a fracture caused
when a bullet passed through his left calf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he was very lucky,'' said Dr. Calvin Lowe, attending
physician of the hospital's emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   A second 6-year-old boy was shot in the left foot. He was
admitted to Granada Hills Community Hospital, did not require
surgery and went home at 7 p.m. with his mother, said spokeswoman
Lori Kapper.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, who declined to identify herself or her son, said he
was in ``fine condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Physicians said the victims didn't say anything about what
happened, but they did express concern for the others wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbis met with parents and relatives at each of the hospitals
to offer support in response to calls from a regional board of
rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you say? There is no reason for this to have
happened,'' said Rabbi Gilbert Kolin, head of the Los Angeles Board
of Rabbis, who met with the parents at Children's Hospital Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get some madman with a gun who shoots children, and
there's nothing you can do. It just shows this can happen
anywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The North Valley Jewish Community Center has been a popular
family gathering spot for classes, programs and other activites for
decades. Shalometh Goldin recalled spending a lot of time there
when she was growing up and said the center is always packed with
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't go to the Jewish Center and be safe, where can
you go and be safe anymore? There's nowhere,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Shalometh Goldin said families were franctically trying to learn
whether family members were wounded in the shooting. She learned of
the shooting when her husband called her at work in Santa Monica.
They went to her mother's house and learned on a recorded telephone
message from the emergency room doctor that she had been shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's in good spirits. My mom's a tough lady,'' she said.

DODGERS' HOPES GO RIGHT DOWN WITH HUNDLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley has never struck fear
into pitchers when he batted from the right side, but he was never
as bad as he's been this season.
</P>
<P>
   It's to the point where he has more than four times more
strikeouts than hits, and it's obviously taking an extreme mental
toll on him.
</P>
<P>
   After striking out from the right side in a pivotal
eighth-inning at-bat in the Dodgers' 6-4 loss to Montreal on
Tuesday night, a frustrated Hundley said he may stop hitting from
the right side before the season ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about giving it up, to tell you the truth,''
Hundley said. ``I have to talk to the coaches and (manager) Davey
(Johnson) and see what they say. (The Giants') J.T. Snow did it and
he's swinging the bat well against left-handers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley hit his 17th homer to give the Dodgers a 1-0 lead in the
second inning, and like the previous 16 he's hit, it was from the
left side.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to a pivotal at-bat with two runners on and one
out in the eighth, Montreal manager Felipe Alou didn't fool around
with right-hander Anthony Telford. He summoned lefty Steve Kline to
turn Hundley around and make the switch-hitter bat right-handed. He
struck out on four pitches.
</P>
<P>
   He's hitting .100 from the right side, just 4 for 40 with no
extra-base hits, two RBI and 18 strikeouts. It's gotten to the
point where it's almost an automatic out when he bats righty, and
what bothers Hundley the most is he knows this.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, the ultimate workhorse, also has power to the opposite
field, and he says that's included in his contemplation. The homer
he hit off Montreal starter Mike Thurman was just inside the
left-field foul pole, like many others this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hit right-handed so you can see the ball coming into
you,'' Hundley said. ``I want the ball away, so I would still get
that facing left-handers. I know I'll at least put the ball in play
from the left side and give it a chance. I've been thinking about
it for a few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson didn't want to talk about Hundley possibly becoming
exclusively a left-handed hitter.
</P>
<P>
   But Hundley's thoughts have merit beyond just this season. Of
his 142 homers, 124 have come as a lefty. In 622 career at-bats
right-handed, he has 125 hits and is hitting .201.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley doesn't tip the average scales from the left side, but
it's not anemic. He's hitting .239 this season and is a .249 career
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough when you don't work on it every day,'' Hundley
said. ``You have to work on it and stay on top of it, and I haven't
been able to do that. It's frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that, particularly this season, can't be blamed fully on
Hundley. He was coming off the reconstructive right elbow surgery
and spent much of the summer re-learning throwing mechanics and
re-conditioning his body to catch.
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't doing that, he was taking swings in the cage from
the left side because that's why the Dodgers acquired him. They
wanted a left-handed power hitter, and Hundley was that. So the
Dodgers acquired Hundley and since released minor-league pitcher
Arnold Gooch for Charles Johnson and Roger Cedeno.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's hitting from the right side was neglected and it's
remained rusty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a little drop in his hands,'' Dodgers hitting coach
Rick Down said. ``There may be other things, but we're looking at
something because something isn't going right.''
</P>
<P>
   Some baseball personnel say Hundley will never be able to hit
from the right side because of holes in his swing, but there are
others who think otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious before you can control performance, you have to
be able to control yourself, emotionally and mentally,'' Down said.
``He's got to see the ball down and believe he can hit it that
way.''

POWER OF ONE HAUNTS VALDES AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ These moments come every game. It's the at-bat in
which the outcome rides, and too many times this season Dodgers
pitcher Ismael Valdes has finished on the wrong side of the
encounter.
</P>
<P>
   For Valdes to become an ace, those are the at-bats he must win.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched magnificently for 42/3 innings Tuesday in Montreal,
but when the showdown came it was Vladimir Guerrero who hit a
three-run homer to punctuate a four-run inning in the Expos' 6-4
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very frustrating,'' Valdes said. ``Tough luck. I just don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of Guerrero's two homers turned a 3-1 Dodgers lead
into a 4-3 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see... one bad pitch,'' Valdes said. ``That's my goal,
not to make that mistake every time you go out there and pitch.
When you think of that one pitch, that's how the game goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes (8-11) has lost four straight. But a more telling sign of
one pitch, or one at-bat, doing in Valdes is that in 17 of his 25
starts the outcome has been decided by one or two runs. The Dodgers
have lost 13 of those.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Valdes) pitched a good game. Basically, he made the one
mistake,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``He walked (Michael
Barrett) in front of Guerrero, and then threw one down the middle.
(Guerrero's) the best guy in the middle of the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Manicure appointment: Dodgers right-hander Kevin Brown, who left
his Monday start with a blister on his right middle finger, visited
a local manicure establishment to have his cracked fingernail filed
and straightened out. He said he's fine and will make his Friday
start.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who is 3-0 with a 0.85 ERA in his last four starts, has
allowed 25 balls hit out of the infield in that span. Twelve were
hits and 13 were fly ball outs.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching some thoughts: If the Dodgers were in a playoff race _
or if they somehow miraculously find themselves in one later on _
Johnson said he might go with a four-man rotation, given their
problems with fifth starters this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about it,'' Johnson said. ``Brownie, Chan Ho
(Park) could probably do it. Not sure about (Ismael) Valdes, but
again, (Darren) Dreifort is the one who takes two days off before
he throws (in the pen) again. To me, the four-man rotation, I'd use
that if I'm close to winning a pennant, or at this day and time,
even a wild-card spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he may skip the fifth starter's spot when the
Dodgers have a day off to give the four starters more chances to
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably will do that,'' Johnson said. ``I'm also looking at
the big picture, and to make good decisions so it will help us down
the line, give us experience and depth.''
</P>
<P>
   This and that: Right-hander Mike Judd joined the team in
Montreal from Triple-A Albuquerque to ready for his Thursday
start.... Eric Young is still on target to join the Dodgers at
Chavez Ravine when they open a three-game series with Atlanta on
Friday. To make room on the roster for the moves, the Dodgers will
likely ship Jeff Kubenka and Matt Herges back to Albuquerque.
