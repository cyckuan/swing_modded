<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Portugal to Sign Agreement on East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Portugal
will sign an agreement early next month on East Timor, ending long
years of hard negotiations, officials from both sides and the
United Nations announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, sitting at a press
conference between Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and his
Portuguese counterpart, Jaime Gama, said that the agreement has
been finalized and will be signed together with its annex in New
York on May 5.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers hailed the agreement as a step toward
restoring peace and stability in the island country, which has
been locked in internal conflicts in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
Gama on his part said that "the effectiveness of the agreement
we are going to sign on May 5 is crucial to restoring stability
and peace in the territory." Alatas said that he was pleased to
have achieved the agreement and two additional documents with his
Portuguese counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will address the need for autonomy in the former
Portuguese colony and the two additional documents will deal with
security arrangements and modality of consultations.
</P>
<P>
Either side was willing to give details so far.
</P>
<P>
As for the security matters, Alatas said that laying down arms
and ceasing hostilities by all parties concerned will be the first
step, which is to be followed by disarmament.
</P>
<P>
He refused to give a firm date for the implementation of the
consultation agreement, but he reaffirmed that his country is
willing to carry it out as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Under the auspices of the United Nations, the two foreign
ministers discussed for the first time this week the security
arrangements and modality of consultation. Alatas said that
although he sees no problem with the context, he has to seek final
approval from his government.
</P>
<P>
Asked if a U.N. presence is necessary for monitoring the
process, the Indonesian foreign minister gave a definite and
positive answer. But he ruled out the possibility of stationing
U.N. peacekeeping forces in the island country.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. presence will be there and this is precisely the
subject of the modality paper," Atalas said, adding "there are
many ways of U.N. presence" and foreign troops are not considered.
</P>
<P>
Pushed to comment on the proposed dispatching of U.N.
peacekeeping forces to East Timor, Atalas said that the issue has
never been on the table so far.
</P>
<P>
Jamsheed Marker, U.N. mediator on East Timor, confirmed that
the parties concerned will continue to work on what shape the U.N
presence should take.
</P>
<P>
Atalas stressed that the Indonesian military and police should
take the main responsibility of maintaining order and stability in
East Timor, while Marker echoed that diplomacy should be given
opportunity of success before considering sending in troops.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian foreign minister hailed the cease-fire accord
signed by all parties in East Timor Wednesday as a "very important
development" which, he hoped, would create a "conducive situation"
to the implementation of the agreements.
</P>
<P>
Under the cease-fire accord, the warring factions agreed to set
up a peace and stability commission, which will mainly take the
responsibility of collecting arms, according to Atalas.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief, who rushed to another meeting before the end of
the press conference, said that he is "grateful for the customary
spirit of cooperation and statesmanship displayed by the two
ministers, which has enabled us to make such progress."

<HEADLINE> Study: Computer Technique Could Cut Smear Test Errors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A semi-automated computer system
developed to analyze cervical smears could decrease numbers of
screening errors and improve productivity, according to a new
study published Friday.
</P>
<P>
The system, called PAPNET, uses artificial intelligence to
identify abnormal smears and check negative slides.
</P>
<P>
Reporting in the medical journal The Lancet, Professor Dulcie
Coleman and researchers, at Imperial College of Medicine in
London, described how the system performed when used to carry out
the first analysis of cervical smears not previously checked by
the human eye.
</P>
<P>
They analyzed 21,700 cervical smears from five centers in the
UK using PAPNET-assisted screening and conventional microscopic
screening to compare the two methods.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the two methods showed agreement in results for about
90 percent of all smears classified as adequate for reporting.
</P>
<P>
However, PAPNET-assisted screening was found significantly
better than conventional screening for correct identification of
negative smears.
</P>
<P>
And the time taken to screen and report the results of smears
was much shorter with PAPNET-assisted screening than with
conventional screening.
</P>
<P>
The researchers believed that use of PAPNET-assisted screening
could increase "quality and productivity" of primary screening.
</P>
<P>
"We recommend carefully organized and controlled development
projects for the introduction of PAPNET-assisted primary screening
of cervical smears," they said.

<HEADLINE> 1 SLA Militiaman Killed, 4 Wounded in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A member of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA) militia was killed and four others were wounded
Friday night by a roadside bomb in south Lebanon, the Voice of the
People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The injured included a high ranking SLA official who was in
serious condition and has been transported to Israel for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
The casualties were caused when a bomb exploded near the
convoy of those militiamen on a road in Jezzine, north of the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
claimed responsibility for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to drive Israeli forces out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The bombing followed an Israeli bombardment Friday afternoon
on a village just outside the zone, which wounded three Lebanese
civilians.

<HEADLINE> France Considers Yugoslav Proposal Insufficient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said Friday that the proposal by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic on a political solution to the conflict is "entirely
insufficient" but not useless.
</P>
<P>
During a press point in Washington where he was attending a
NATO summit marking the 50th anniversary of the alliance, Chirac
said that France supports the mission by former Russian Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"France always supports the involvement of Russia in search for
a political solution to the crisis, so we are happy about the
voyage (by Chernomyrdin)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Milosevic has made a six-point proposal
including an "international presence" in Kosovo under the guide of
the U.N. and with the participation of Russia, a possible
reduction of Serb troops and police force in Kosovo, and the
guarantee for a safe return of Kosovo refugees to their homes.
</P>
<P>
"What Mr. Milosevic said is entirely insufficient. I don't say
that it is useless at all, but that does not correspond to the
demands by the international community, such as those which have
been expressed by the Secretary General of the U.N.," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He called on Russia to continue its diplomatic efforts engaging
the Yugoslav authorities.

<HEADLINE> WFP Launches New Operation to Help Famine People in DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World
Food Program (WFP) had approved a new 260 million U.S. dollar
emergency operation to help feed for a year 8 million people hit
by famine in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), a
U.N. release said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new operation targets the largest number of people since
the WFP began fighting famine in the country in late 1995.
</P>
<P>
A nutritional survey last year showed that acute malnutrition
affected about 16 percent of children between the ages of six and
seven years while chronic malnutrition or stunting affected 62
percent, reflecting the impact of the long-term food shortage.
</P>
<P>
The new one-year emergency operation starts on July 1 and will
cost 260.34 million dollars. It is aimed at a total of 8,044,000
people, including 1,470,000 children from six months to four years
old in nurseries, 655,000 kindergarten children between five and
six, 1,362,000 primary school children between seven and 11 years,
1,947,000 secondary school children between the ages of 12 and 17
and 10,000 orphans up to 17.
</P>
<P>
In addition to children identified as the most vulnerable, the
operation also seeks to supply food to 120,000 hospital patients,
320,000 pregnant and nursing women, 1,650,000 people in the WFP's
"food for work" projects and their dependents and 500,000 people
over 60 years old.
</P>
<P>
It is the fifth consecutive emergency operation mounted in the
country by the WFP. The last operation, which began in April 1998
and ends on June 30 this year, was aimed at 6.7 million
beneficiaries with 602,972 metric tons of food at a total cost of
345 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> France Opposes Sea Blockade to Cut Oil Supply to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- France is opposed to a sea blockade
by NATO in the Adriatic Sea to cut oil supply to Yugoslavia, and
prefers to cut transport lines between Serbia and Montenegro,
which is Yugoslavia's only sea exit.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac said Friday that a sea blockade
against Yugoslavia does not have legal basis, and that it is more
efficient to impose an oil embargo on Yugoslavia by destroying the
bridges between Serbia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
Both NATO and the European Union have imposed an oil embargo on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the statement at the NATO summit in Washington
which opened Friday, said local media reports.
</P>
<P>
The French president again called on NATO to study his proposal
to air drop food and medicines to the displaced people in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the alliance to be "very careful" about its
relationship with Russia, and to watch closely the situation in
Montenegro, according to the reports.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Farmers, Suppliers Urged Not to Hoard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Ministry of
Trade and Industry Friday advised coffee producers, suppliers and
exporters in the country not to store coffee away.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister Brook Debebe told local press that hoarding
coffee cold result in significant loss for the producers and
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
"If coffee producers, suppliers and exporters hoard coffee in
the hope of making a profit through future changes in the value of
coffee, they are in for a disaster," the Ethiopian News Agency
quoted Brook as saying
</P>
<P>
The vice minister noted that the world price of coffee has
slumped down by 30 percent over the last eight months.
</P>
<P>
Farmers and suppliers supplied less than 79 percent of the
130,410 tons of coffee originally envisaged to reach the central
auction over the last nine months, he said.
</P>
<P>
The amount of coffee supplied during the first nine months of
1998/99 was 14 percent and 21 percent less than that of same
periods of 1997/98 and 1996/98 respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
Brook said that 170.8 million U.S. dollars were obtained from
the export of 60,000 tons of coffee over the last nine months.
</P>
<P>
He added that the money obtained from coffee export this year
was 38 percent and 21 percent less than that of the same periods
of 1997/98 and 1996/97 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister attributed the fluctuation in the price of
coffee and failure on the part of producers to supply the crop to
the central auction to the fall in the amount of coffee revenue.

<HEADLINE> NATO Statement Sets Conditions for End of Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- NATO would intensify its its
air strikes against Yugoslavia unless President Slobodan Milosevic
accepted its five conditions on the settlement of the Kosovo
crisis, a NATO statement said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued at the conclusion of a three-hour session
of the first day of the NATO 50th anniversary summit said: "There
can be no compromise on these conditions."
</P>
<P>
The conditions imposed by the Western alliance include
Yugoslavia's withdrawal from its sovereign territory of Kosovo
province and NATO's presence there for so-called peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
"NATO is prepared to suspend its air strikes once Belgrade has
unequivocally accepted the above mentioned conditions and
demonstrably begun to withdraw its forces from Kosovo according to
a precise and rapid timetable," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said NATO was "putting in place additional
measures to tighten the constraints" on Belgrade, including
economic sanctions and an oil embargo, and asked defense ministers
to seek ways of halting the delivery of war material, "including
by launching maritime operations."
</P>
<P>
The statement declared that "NATO is determined to prevail,"
but it makes no mention of a possible use of ground troops prior
to a peace agreement and shunned the ethnic Albanians' demand for
independence, reaffirming that they should "enjoy substantial
autonomy within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
The NATO leaders said in the statement that they would seek a
U.N. Security Council resolution "requiring the withdrawal of Serb
forces and the demilitarization of Kosovo and encompassing the
deployment of an international military force to safeguard the
swift return of all refugees and displaced persons."
</P>
<P>
That would likely set up a confrontation with Russia, which has
veto power in the Security Council and has strongly opposed the
NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
But they said they were still willing to seek to work
constructively with Russia, as Russia has "an important role to
play in a search for a solution to the conflict in Kosovo."

<HEADLINE> Fly Control by Spray Reduces Eye Disorder: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The major cause of preventable
blindness could be significantly reduced by an insecticide spray
to control the spread of flies, researchers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, led by Paul Emerson of the Medical Research
Council in The Gambia, have looked at links between flies and
trachoma, the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Trachoma, a bacterial infection of the upper eyelid, occurs
when eyes become infected with the bacterium Chlamydia
trachomatis, which is transmitted from one person to another by
flies landing on the face.
</P>
<P>
The disorder, most common in hotter countries, affects more
than 150 million people, mostly in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
In their research, Emerson and colleagues studied the effects
of fly control by insecticide spray deltamethrin on the prevalence
of trachoma and childhood diarrhoea in two villages in The Gambia.
</P>
<P>
The insecticide was sprayed for three months to control flies
in one village, while the other village acted as a control.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the medical journal The Lancet, the researchers
reported that after three months of fly control, there were 75
percent fewer new cases of trachoma in the villages in which
deltamethrin spray was used.
</P>
<P>
They also found that children in the sprayed villages had a 22
percent lower risk of diarrhoea than those in the control villages
in the wet season, and 26 percent lower risk of diarrhoea in the
dry season.
</P>
<P>
"Spraying would be a useful adjunct to trachoma-elimination
strategies, but further research on sustainable fly-control
methods is needed," the researchers concluded.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Peace Talks to be Resumed This Year: British </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- British Minister of State at the
Home Office Joyce Quin said Friday the aim of the international
community for Cyprus is to bring about negotiation later this
year.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the end of her two-day visit to
Cyprus, Quin said there is some common ground between the two
sides of the island.
</P>
<P>
However, she said she can not guarantee a push will come about
for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Quin said her visit was to demonstrate Britain's continuing
and active commitment to international efforts to help bring
about a comprehensive settlement on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
She said international community would like to see the
"substance of all aspects of the settlement addressed in depth
and without preconditions."
</P>
<P>
However, Quin emphasized that "ultimately, whether a solution
to Cyprus' problem can be agreed depends on Cypriots and their
leaders, no-one can impose a settlement from outside."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash opted out of the peace
talks in summer 1997 and later proposed to establish a
confederation of two equal states on the island, which is staunchly
opposed by international community.
</P>
<P>
Quin said that she has stressed in her talks here that if
either side insists on preconditions that are unacceptable to the
other, negotiations will not begin.
</P>
<P>
She reiterated Britain's support for U.N. resolutions, which
envisage reuniting the island by a bi-zonal, bi-communal
federation formula.
</P>
<P>
This is Quin's first visit to the island in her official
capacity, during which she had meetings with Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides, Rauf Denktash and other officials.

<HEADLINE> Russia Visit to Open New Chapter in Ties: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said Friday that his just-concluded visit to Russia will
begin a new chapter in Pakistan-Russia relations in the days
ahead.
</P>
<P>
"I have the understanding that a new chapter is opening. A new
leaf will be turned in Pak-Russian bilateral relations. And we
should expect better changes in the future," Sharif told reporters
upon arrival back from a four-day official visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the outcome of his visit, the first by a
Pakistani prime minister in 25 years, Sharif said its result could
be gauged by what has been stated by Russian President Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin described Sharif's visit as a "historic event," adding
that he was "fully satisfied" with his meeting with the Pakistani
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
During his 45-minute meeting with Sharif in the Kremlin on
Wednesday, Yeltsin said: "As of today, we leave our past behind
and buried and take a new step in our relations."
</P>
<P>
On the Jammu and Kashmir issue between Pakistan and India,
Sharif said "Russia had a good opportunity to understand
Pakistan's point of view" during his visit. "We have definitely
used this opportunity in a positive way. We have said this too,
that you (Russia) play a role in resolving the Kashmir problem."
</P>
<P>
"A great potential exists between Pakistan and Russia for
cooperation in various fields" and "both countries are ready for
it," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two countries agreed to give
most-favored-nation treatment to each other in the matter of
trade.
</P>
<P>
A trade agreement was signed between them on Tuesday to replace
a barter trade agreement inked in 1956.
</P>
<P>
Asked what was the viewpoint of Russia on nuclear and missile
tests by Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif said: "It was the same reaction or
point of view which they had expressed" earlier.
</P>
<P>
Russia had expressed its concern over the nuclear tests by
Pakistan in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan made it clear that it was forced to test nuclear
devices to protect its vital security interests and correct the
regional imbalance created by Indian blasts.
</P>
<P>
It also test-fired its Ghauri-II and Shaheen ballistic missiles
in response to the Indian test-firing of the Agni-II earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Russia, Sharif also held a meeting with
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.

<HEADLINE> Germany Responds Cautiously to Chernomyrdin Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- German officials Friday reacted with
reserve to Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin's mediating endeavor
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Vice government spokeswoman Charima Reinhardt said that the
details of Chernomyrdin's proposal were still unclear.
</P>
<P>
It remained a problem whether Belgrade would really accept an
international peacekeeping force, Reinhardt said, quoting the
Itar-Tass report that Yugoslavia President Slobodan Milosevic had
again rejected foreign soldiers being stationed in his country.
</P>
<P>
But Bonn welcomed any constructive bill for a political
solution to the Kosovo crisis, she said.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman stressed that Yugoslavia should withdraw
military and police forces from Kosovo before NATO stopped air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
Ministers of state for foreign affairs, Gunter Verheugen and
Ludger Volmer, also expressed thanks to Russia for its engagement.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Write off Mozambique's Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will write off eight
million U.S. dollars Mozambican debt, South African Financial
Minister Trevor Manuel said said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who is on a two-day visit to Mozambique, made
the announcement at a joint press conference with his Mozambican
counterpart Tomaz Salomao.
</P>
<P>
Manuel said that it is natural for South Africa to remit
Mozambique's debt, as both South Africa and Mozambique have been
urging creditor nations for further relief of debt. The relief,
though symbolic, can be taken as a signal to other creditor
nations, Salomao said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Mozambique's total foreign debt reaches as
much as 5.5 billion U.S. dollars. But as a candidate for the
"highly indebted poor country initiative", most of the country's
foreign debt will be relieved.
</P>
<P>
Salomao said that Mozambique is expected to have its debt
reduced to 1. 1 billion dollars after debt relief decision is
finalized in this May.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the two financial ministers will also
discuss issues concerning the development of an industrial
corridor, Panda gas field in Mozambique and the pipe designed from
Mozambique's gas field to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
They will also talk, among other issues, a joint agricultural
development program in northern Mozambique's Niassa Province,
which has been plagued with problems.

<HEADLINE> NATO Draft Declaration Sets Conditions for End of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- NATO would suspend its air
strikes against Yugoslavia only when President Slobodan Milosevic
accepted its five conditions on the settlement of the Kosovo
crisis, a European diplomat said Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO was drafting a declaration to be issued by NATO
leaders at their 50th anniversary summit in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The draft declaration would back German proposals by saying the
NATO leaders were "prepared to suspend the air strikes after a
clear agreement by Belgrade on the conditions and after the
beginning of a withdrawal" of Yugoslav troops from the province.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat quoted the draft declaration as saying NATO was
"determined to stop this campaign of terror" and bring about a
"democratic, multiethnic Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
The draft called for an intensification of the air strikes and
stronger economic sanctions against Yugoslavia, including an oil
embargo, but made no mention of the option of sending ground
troops into Kosovo before a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
It threated Milosevic with "serious consequences" by continuing
to resist NATO's demands.

<HEADLINE> PM: Turkey to Take Measures Against Missile Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said Friday that Turkey will take necessary measures to
prevent possible threat from the deployment of Russian-made
missiles on a Greek island.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit told reporters that "Turkey is in a position to take all
the necessary technical measures to prevent the possible threat
from the Greek deployment of the S-300 missiles on its Grete
Island."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after Greece confirmed Thursday that a
Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft system, which was originally
destined for Cyprus, has begun being assembled on the Greek island.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that the move of Greece will be detrimental to
itself.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Greek politicians regard Turkey as a danger and
are taking steps against Turkey, he said.
</P>
<P>
Greece and the Cypriot government decided last December to
deploy the S-300 missile system on Greece's Grete island, leaving
Turkey out of its range to avoid provocation.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli has
said that "the deployment of S-300 missiles on Crete will add a
new problem into the existing complicated relations between
Turkey and Greece."
</P>
<P>
"Thus it can't be accepted that this policy of Greeks and
Greek Cypriots is very accurate and rational," said Atacanli.
</P>
<P>
The delivery of the missiles had been put off several times
under Turkish and international pressure.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north after Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
island in 1974 in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.

ATHENS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Greece Friday welcomed the
initiative of Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, who said after
talks in Belgrade that he had won Yugoslavia's agreement to an
"international presence" in Kosovo under the United Nations'
auspices and with Russia's participation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman Nikos
Athanassakis described Chernomyrdin's initiative as "positive,"
saying that any international force sent to Kosovo to keep the
peace should be armed in order to ensure normality in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that Greece could participate in the
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed the need of promoting procedures for a
political settlement of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that Athens supported the withdrawal of Serb force from
Kosovo and the simultaneous cessation of NATO bombings on
Yugoslavia.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Demonstrators rallied in
Washington Friday to protest against NATO's bombing campaign in
Yugoslavia as NATO leaders opened the 50th anniversary summit.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of protesters organized by the fourth Freedom Forum held
a rally at the Washington Monument to oppose the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
"Our focus is the present nuclear dilemma facing the world,"
said Alisair Miller, director of the group's Washington office.
"NATO's nuclear weapons were introduced decades ago to counter a
perceived threat that no longer exists."
</P>
<P>
Miller said he feared that potential protesters were scared
away because of reports about the tight security imposed in
Washington because of the summit.
</P>
<P>
A local Serbian church organized a protest Saturday calling for
an end to the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
"We are protesting the bombing because we consider it illegal
and civilian people are being killed," said Zoran Hodjera,
congregation president of St. Luke Serbian Orthodox Church in
Washington, which is organizing the rally.
</P>
<P>
"Before the bombing, we had only minor problems," Hodjera said.
"We never had any true negotiations between the parties. That
avenue was never pursued properly."

<HEADLINE> Retrenchments Still High In S'pore: Union Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A Singapore union leader said
Friday that retrenchments were still high in his country although
there were signs of economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Heng Chee How, assistant secretary-general of the National
Trades Union Congress, said that a total of 1,527 workers from 47
companies had lost their jobs so far this year and three companies
planned to lay off 138 more shortly.
</P>
<P>
Heng also said the first quarter of this year saw a total of
1,179 retrenchments in the unionized sector, still higher than the
pre-economic crisis level.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there were 678 retrenchments in the
unionized sector in the first quarter of 1996, 568 in the same
period of 1997 and 4,309 in the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
Heng said the figure shows "the worst is not over."
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to be mindful of the state of the economy
which remains uncertain," he said.
</P>
<P>
Heng also noted that total wage increases (including bonus)
continue their downward trend.
</P>
<P>
The National Semiconductors Pte Ltd (NS) Thursday announced its
decision to lay off 165 employees, 10 percent of the company's
workforce.

<HEADLINE> NATO Widens Airstrikes Against Yugoslav Civilian Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) sea-launched cruise missiles struck two
electric power transformers in the Belgrade area overnight,
marking a further escalation of NATO's air campaign, the U.S.
Defense Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It is a new class of targets," Pentagon spokesman Kenneth
Bacon told a briefing at which he announced that allied warplanes
flew 434 missions Thursday despite bad weather.
</P>
<P>
The electric power transformers were struck by Tomahawk cruise
missiles, which use satellites for precise guidance.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said the electrical power sites also served residential
and business customers but were struck because they supply power
to military command and control facilities linked to the Yugoslav
army.
</P>
<P>
Bacon also announced that the Pentagon had decided not to add a
second aircraft carrier to the NATO naval force attacking
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The USS Theodore Roosevelt battle group is operating in the
NATO campaign, along with British and French carriers. Strike
aircraft from the Roosevelt attacked a column of seven Yugoslav
armored personnel carriers overnight and apparently inflicted
heavy damage, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
The month-long NATO air campaign had heavily damaged roads,
bridges and resupply depots, as well as important communications
systems and significant percentages of Serb weaponry, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has called NATO's plans to update
its ground invasion scenario "a wise and prudent course," but
stressed that NATO intended to stick with the air campaign and had
no intention of launching a ground offensive.

Kofi Annan Friday hailed an agreement on East Timor, saying that
he was looking forward to concluding this historic process.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached Friday morning between Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Atalas and his Portugal counterpart, Jaime
Gama, after productive and successful rounds of talks which were
brokered by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has been finalized and will be signed together
with its annex in New York on May 5, 1999.
</P>

concluding this historic process on the 5th May, when all these
agreements will be signed."
</P>
<P>
"I am grateful for the customary spirit of cooperation and
statesmanship displayed by the two ministers, which has enabled us
to make such progress," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the reaffirmation by the Indonesian government that
it will effectively carry out its responsibility for law and order
and the protection of civilians," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>

who signed an agreement this week to end the violence in East
Timor to fulfill their obligations without delay. Peace and
stability are vital in East Timor," he added.

<HEADLINE> Main Rebel Group Vows to Crush Regional Guerrilla </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The rebellious Congolese Rally
For Democracy (RCD) has vowed to fight guerrilla forces which are
threatening the security of is allies Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"The RCD leadership has laid out strategies to restore security
in the Great Lakes region," Joseph Mudumbi, the head of the
department of Interior was quoted as saying by a special report
reaching here from Rwanda News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Mudumbi declared in a statement that his rebel movement is
going to fight Rwandan Hutu extremist militias, the Burundi Hutu
rebels of the Front for the Defense of Democracy in Burundi (FDD)
and the Uganda rebels using northern and southern Kivu provinces
of eastern Congo as launching pads for their cross-border raids.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made Thursday in Bukavu, South Kivu,
following a meeting of the RCD leadership, the governors of the
provinces which fell to the rebels during the eight-month old
war.
</P>
<P>
The RCD has embarked on a program of sensitizing the local
Congolese, notably the Mai Mai tribal militia to dissociate
themselves from the guerrilla forces operating in the region. It
has also deployed police units in over 70 territories of the
provinces it conquered.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Congolese rebels have blasted the peace deal signed
by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Laurent Kabila, alleging
 that they had not been associated.

ATHENS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Greece's main opposition New

President Nikos Constantopoulos agreed during their talks Friday
that Greece should not become directly or indirectly involved in
any ground operations by NATO in Yugoslavia.

Both sides also called for the establishment of a foreign

On his part, Constantopoulos criticized NATO for its rejection
of the Russian initiative and the bombing of Serbian state
television, saying that these showed that NATO was blocking all
paths for finding a political solution and was trying to escalate
the conflict.

Meanwhile, the municipal council of the northern Greek port
city of Thessaloniki Friday voted unanimously against Greece
providing further facilities or logistical support for NATO forces

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Oil Price Hike May Fuel Philippines' Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corp.
joined the oil price increase bandwagon on Thursday night when it
raised its prices by an average of 43 centavos per liter.
</P>
<P>
Caltex and Petron, the other two of the three biggest oil
companies of the Philippines, have already adjusted its prices by
an average of 50 centavos and 47 centavos respectively.
</P>
<P>
Reynaldo Gamboa, vice president of Shell, said Thursday that
the price hike was mainly due to the movement of world crude
prices.
</P>
<P>
The oil firms hinted that there could be another round of
increases in the next few days, especially if the uptrend in crude
prices is sustained.
</P>
<P>
From about 10.50 U.S. dollars per barrel last February, crude
prices rose to an average of 12.45 U.S. dollars per barrel in
March and reached 15 U.S. dollars per barrel early this month
after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut down
production by 2.1 million barrels in a bid to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
As a rule of thumb, an increase or decrease by a dollar in
crude prices translates into an adjustment of 30 centavos per
liter in pump prices.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, oil prices either go up or down 10 centavos per liter
for every 1 peso gained or dropped versus the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Using this as the basis for computing the needed adjustment,
the oil price increase should be about 1.20 pesos per liter.
</P>
<P>
In response to the price hike, the Department of Trade and
Industry said President Joseph Estrada has ordered all relevant
agencies to take steps in protecting consumers from the expected
spiral effect of the oil price hike.
</P>
<P>
However, Trade Secretary Jose Pardo said the government cannot
stop oil firms from increasing prices, although they can be
reminded of their commitment to the public.
</P>
<P>
"The oil industry is now fully deregulated. As much as
possible, we allow market forces to govern, not wanting to
intervene, unless there is evidence of collusion or exploitation,"
Pardo said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, some economists are worrying that the new
increases in prices of petroleum products are bound to put
pressure on the prices of other consumer goods to also move up,
although a recovery in the agricultural sector could still bring
food prices-- and the overall inflation rate--down in April.
</P>
<P>
They said the direct impact of higher fuel prices on the
consumer price index (CPI) or inflation rate will be minimal. But
they are concerned more about the indirect impact of higher fuel
prices -- such as higher transportation cost -- on food prices.
</P>
<P>
"Still the direct impact of oil on the inflation basket is very
small, but the question is how do we quantify the indirect effect
of higher oil prices on food prices," said Bankers Association of
the Philippines chief economist Johnny Noe Ravallo.
</P>
<P>
Economists said food prices have a bigger impact on inflation,
but they are watching how the higher fuel costs will affect food
prices.
</P>
<P>
If the oil price hike triggers corresponding increases in
transport fares and prices of prime commodities, the inflation
rate for April might be higher than the predicted 8.3 percent
level, the economists said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The red-green coalition government
in Bonn presented Friday the year 1999's budget plan, the first
one since the cabinet took over the power last autumn.
</P>
<P>
The budget calls for a spending of 485.7 billion marks (264
billion U.S. dollars), 1.2 percent up from last year. The spending
rise is lower than the rate of 1.7 percent foreseen in the
original bill.
</P>
<P>
Allocation for social welfare will rise to 172.4 billion marks,
an increase of nearly 10 billion marks from 1998.
</P>
<P>
New state borrowing is to be restricted at 53.5 billion marks.
Originally it has been set at 56.2 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
Experts of the ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD) said part
of Bonn's spending, about 20 billion marks, should be covered by
privatizing the state's holdings to shape up Germany's finance.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was backed by the Greens Party, junior partner
that shares power with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's SPD.
</P>
<P>
The budget, finalized much later than normal due to government
changeover, will be sent to the parliament in early May.

<HEADLINE> NATO Summit Decides to Impose Oil Embargo on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) summit decided here Friday to tighten economic
sanctions against Yugoslavia by imposing an embargo on petroleum
products to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after they met for three hours to discuss
the crisis in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, leaders of the 19
NATO member countries stopped short of imposing a full naval
blockade on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
However, they asked their defense ministers to study ways to
halt through "maritime operations" the shipment of war supplies to
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
France opposed a full naval blockade on the grounds that NATO
would violate international law, a NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, the European Union (EU) formally adopted a
decision to impose a ban on deliveries of oil and oil products to
Yugoslavia by EU member nations.
</P>
<P>
NATO airstrikes have put Serbia's two oil refineries out of
operation in an effort to cut off fuel supplies to Serbian troops
in Kosovo. However, petroleum supplies have not been completely
cut off.

<HEADLINE> Economists Optimistic About Asian Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Five economics who read their
papers Friday at the Asia Forum 1999 all expressed optimism about
the economic outlook for Asia this year, forecasting economic
contraction will come to a stop this year.
</P>
<P>
The forum was jointly organized by Singapore's Institute of
Southeast Asian Study (ISEAS) and Japan's Nomura Research
Institute to discuss the prospect of Asian recovery and financial
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Jungho Yoo, vice president of the Development Institute of
South Korea, told the forum that given the trends in consumption
and investment in his country, it seems likely that South Korea's
economy will register about two percent growth in 1999 compared
with the 5.6 percent contraction in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Hitoshi Okuda, director of the Center for Knowledge Exchange
and Creation, Nomura Research Institute, said he forecasts his
country's economy will stop shrinking around the end of 1999 as
adjustments in domestic private-sector demand run their course.
</P>
<P>
As current improvement in the Japanese economy is basically
only temporary and the economy will require a more structural
adjustments, he forecasts a growth rate of minus 1.3 percent,
lower than the government's forecast of positive 0.5 percent
growth.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaoji, director-general of the Research Department of
Foreign Economic Relations of the Development Research Center of
the State Council of China, told the forum that the momentum of
China's economic development is quite good and China can realize
the target of seven percent growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
To support his view, Zhang expounded on China's policies on
expanding domestic demand and the reform of state-owned
enterprises as well as on measures to prevent financial risks and
keep the RMB's exchange rate stable.
</P>
<P>
Edward K Y Chen, president of Lingnan College, Hong Kong,
predicted Hong Kong's economy will achieve a growth rate of two
percent which is in striking contrast with the negative growth
forecast by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he made such a prediction partly because of
improvement in Hong Kong's internal economic fundamentals and in
the external economic environment, and partly because of
statistical effects. The dramatic fall in GDP in 1998 means a very
low base for 1999 to benchmark on, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Chao-cheng Mai, president of Chun-Hua Institution for Economic
Research in Taiwan, predicted Taiwan's economy will grow 4.97
percent in 1999, among the lowest growth rates in the history of
the development of the Taiwan economy.
</P>
<P>
Summing up, ISEAS Director Chia Siow Yue said Asian economies
have bottomed out.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Lacks Funds for Repatriation of Afghan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Officials from the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said here Friday that they are
facing financial problems repatriation of Afghan refugees from
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Despite the continued desire of substantial numbers of Afghan
refugees to return to their homes, the UNHCR suffered its
worst-ever funding crisis for its Afghanistan program during 1998,
and the outlook for 1999 is bleak, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to a U.N. refugee bulletin, funding for refugee
repatriation and reintegration had virtually dried up altogether
by October last year, even though Afghans were the largest
assisted returnee group anywhere in the world with 107,000
returnees going back with UNCHR assistance in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of funds has already damaged the momentum and
credibility of the new group repatriation scheme. And even more
seriously, some refugee groups, who went home earlier in 1998, are
threatening to return to Pakistan, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Susan Manuel, a spokesperson for the World Food
Program, said here Friday at a press briefing that about 20,000
Afghan refugees living in Pakistan will face starvation if the WFP
does not get funds.
</P>
<P>
The emergency aid would be terminated to the Afghan refugees on
April 30 unless the WFP gets new funds, she said.
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Bottoechi, a senior official from the UNHCR in
Islamabad, said 100,000 Afghan refugees had been returning
annually with the help of the UNHCR. But the process has slowed
down because of lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
"We have stopped all UNHCR assistance to individual refugees,"
he said, adding that assistance is now provided on a community
basis to make the refugees self-reliant.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNHCR, about 7,500 refugees have been
repatriated so far this year and the figure is expected to reach
10,000 by the end of June.

<HEADLINE> Oceanographer Says La Nina Will End This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese oceanographers agree that
the weather phenomenon of La Nina will end in the latter half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese State Oceanic Administration revealed this
conclusion in a news conference held today. Experts believe that
La Nina has passed its peak and will continuously decrease.
</P>
<P>
La Nina's literal meaning is 'girl' and is brought about by
colder than normal surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean which
greatly affects global weather patterns as much as its rival El
Nino.
</P>
<P>
The latest La Nina emerged last summer and is believed to have
had some effect on the great floods along China's Yangtze River
last summer.

BONN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
will visit Berlin Sunday evening to hold talks with political
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Annan is due to give a major speech on Europe's role in the
21st century for this year's Berlin Address, an annual forum at

<P>
The problems in the region can only be solved with the help of
an international peacekeeping force under the mandate of the U.N.
Security Council, he said.

<HEADLINE> Marine Disasters More Serious Than Last Year, Experts Predict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Oceanographers have
agreed that China's marine disasters in 1999 will be more serious
than last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the frequent occurrences of disastrous
storms along coastal areas will be higher than last year and the
level of the disasters will also be more serious.
</P>
<P>
There were only three disastrous storms in China in 1998,
considerably down on ten years ago, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
However, there will be four or five disastrous storms along
China's coastal areas between June and October and maybe one or
two between September and October, experts predict.
</P>
<P>
The State Oceanic Administration has required local governments
in coastal areas to be alert to these upcoming disasters and
reduce losses to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
Marine disasters caused direct economic loss to China of about
1 billion yuan last year.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Details Added Anti-China Resolution Doomed to Fail, FM Spokesman (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States was merely
playing "an anti-China melodrama" when proposing an anti-China
resolution on human rights and its move was doomed to fail, said
China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi here tonight.
</P>
<P>
Sun made the remarks after the adoption of a decision not to
review and vote on the U.S.-sponsored draft resolution on China's
human rights situation at the 55th session of the United Nations
Commission on Human Rights held in Geneva, Switzerland, this
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The UN commission voted in favor of a Chinese proposal to take
no action on the U.S. resolution with 22 votes in favor, 17
against and 14 in abstention at the session, according to the
latest report.
</P>
<P>
It was the eighth time that the United Nations Commission on
Human Rights turned down an anti-China resolution since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Sun expressed his admiration and gratitude to all the countries
that have upheld justice and rendered support to China in foiling
the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Sun described the U.S. as being in a "solitary position," when
tabling the resolution, saying the move would firmly be opposed by
China and a large number of developing countries. Even the
European Union and some western countries had not joined the U.S.
efforts this year, he added.

<HEADLINE> NATO Opens 50th Anniversary Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- NATO leaders of 19 member
countries Friday opened a 50th anniversary summit obsessed by
troubles of desperate air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The war engaged by NATO in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia,
has changed what was to have been a jubilant celebration into a
crisis summit on how best to force the Yugoslav forces to pull out
of the province.
</P>
<P>
After failure to drive the Yugoslav troops out of Kosovo by
five-week bombing, NATO was considering a possible invasion of the
province by sending ground troops there.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said in opening remarks to
the assembled leaders that Europe was "confronting a very serious
crisis."
</P>
<P>
NATO has obviously shifted its previous functions of taking
actions within its boundary and has now adopted what it called a
new concept: waging an outside-territorial war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the NATO summit, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic had signaled through a Russian diplomat a willingness to
allow some international presence in Kosovo, but Western leaders
insisted on having an armed peacekeeping force in the province.
</P>
<P>
Solana threatened that Milosevic must accept NATO's demand or
face continued bombings.
</P>
<P>
"Milosevic must know there is no place for his policies in
Europe on the eve of the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
The use of NATO ground troops is now taken into consideration
as NATO's air strikes have yielded no apparent results as NATO
leaders had expected.
</P>
<P>
The issue of sending ground troops is surely a topic to be
discussed by major NATO leaders even though a NATO official denied
it a formal subject "on the agenda."
</P>
<P>
NATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Wesley Clark was given
authority Wednesday to lead a study on how many troops it would
take to drive the Serbs from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Beside the issue of the Kosovo crisis, NATO leaders were also
expected to adopt decisions on other issues, including an update
of NATO's strategy for the 21st century, recognition of a greater
role for Europe within the alliance and a reaffirmation of NATO's
commitment to keep its door open to new members from Central and
Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting was under extraordinary security.
Washington's central downtown area was cordoned off for security
reasons. To minimize traffic gridlock for the summit, thousands of
federal employees were given the day off. Schools were closed, as
well as many businesses in the downtown security zone.

<HEADLINE> Six Hurt in Police Chase Shooting in England </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Six people were hurt Friday after
gunmen opened fire in Greater Manchester in middle England after a
failed robbery attempt.
</P>
<P>
Police said four people had been arrested at the end of a
"major incident" which began in Lancashire, according to a BBC
report.
</P>
<P>
The gang, who are believed to have carried out a failed robbery
in Chorley, Lancashire, abandoned their car in Bolton, Greater
Manchester, around lunch time.
</P>
<P>
They then hijacked a silver BMW car to Rochdale, 190 miles (305
km) northwest of London, where six people were injured in three
separate shootings.
</P>
<P>
At one point the gunmen, with several police Range Rovers in
pursuit, shot at a queue of people at a bus stop, hitting one man
in the head.
</P>
<P>
The gang were followed by police and the silver BMW car crashed
near Rochdale Town Hall, with two arrested on the spot.
</P>
<P>
A Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle and a pistol were later
recovered from the BMW.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Rochdale Infirmary said they were dealing with
five casualties -- one person had an arm injury, two had leg
wounds, one was suffering from severe shock and a fifth suffered
chest pains after being shot at.

According to Sun, the result again demonstrated that to
interfere in other countries' internal affairs and pursue
hegemonism and power politics under the pretext of human rights
could not win popular support. "Confrontation is not the way out,"
Sun pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has always attached importance to human
rights and made unswerving efforts to promote and improve China's
human rights situation," Sun said, adding that China had scored
noteworthy achievements in the regard.
</P>
<P>
"With consideration to its own domestic political needs and
partisan struggle, the United States, however, in total disregard
of the facts, again tabled an anti-China resolution in an attempt
to interfere in China's internal affairs under the pretext of
human rights and defame China's international image," Sun noted.
</P>
<P>
"Such move is not only in violation of the guidelines and
principles of the United Nations Charter, but also against the
current trend in the international human rights arena to advocate
dialog and oppose confrontation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sun pointed out that the Chinese government has consistently
advocated to carry out dialogs and exchanges on human rights on
the basis of equality and mutual respect in a bid to enhance
understanding and reduce differences.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to push forward the healthy development of
international human rights cause along with the international
community under the guidelines and principles of the United
Nations Charter," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Clinton Friday
announced a sum of 1.5 million dollars as financial assistance to
the victims of the Colorado school shooting.
</P>
<P>
The president said the money, which was drawn from the federal
Crime Victims' Fund, was an initial payment to help the students,
teachers and parents affected by the slaying on "their long
journey toward recovery. And we will do more."
</P>
<P>
"The images from Colorado have become painfully familiar: the
terrified children, the racing ambulances, the grieving families,"
Clinton said at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"Still, it is important to remember that the vast majority of
schools are safe," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reminded school officials across the country of federal
programs to help prevent violent eruptions of rage, such as the
two students unleashed inside Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore was traveling to Colorado to
attend memorial services of the killed in the most serious school
shooting in America's history. As many as 15 people, including the
two teenage gunmen, were killed in Tuesday's campus tragedy.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Tokyo's New Governor Must Be Cautious in Making Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The newly-inaugurated governor of
Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, after repeatedly making erroneous
statements detrimental to Sino-Japan friendship, is still
persisting in his anti-China stance, wantonly intervening in
China's internal affairs, and attacking China's policy on Taiwan
and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Since Friday is the first day of Ishihara's term as governor of
Tokyo, people are expecting him, an official who holds the most
important local government post in Japan, to make a fresh start,
refrain from making erroneous speeches which will hurt Chinese
people's feelings and shift to the position of maintaining Sino-
Japan friendship.
</P>
<P>
However, at a press conference following his inauguration
Friday, Ishihara continued his erroneous stance on the Tibet and
Taiwan issues, making groundless charges against China's central
government's policy toward Tibet and Taiwan and distorting China's
policy of peacefully reuniting the motherland with Taiwan, while
not ruling out the use of force.
</P>
<P>
As is known to all, China has long been a multi-national
country, and Tibet and Taiwan are inalienable parts of China's
sacred territory. Most countries, including Japan, have all
recognized and observe the "One China" policy, while respecting
China's principled stand related to national sovereignty. Under
the Japan-China Joint Statement and Japan-China Peace and
Friendship Treaty, the Japanese side confirmed principles of
mutual respect of sovereignty and territorial integrity, and all
the successive governments of Japan abided by the "one China"
policy.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka, in response to
Ishihara's anti-China speeches, pointed out on April 19 that Japan
would not change its policy toward China. He said Japan would
continue to carry out principles enshrined in the Japanese-China
Joint Statement and continue to develop good neighborly relations
with China, one of the major Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
As a newly inaugurated local official, Ishihara made
irresponsible statements on a major issue concerning China's
unification and sovereignty, completely in disregard of the
Japanese government's China policy.
</P>
<P>
As such anti-China statements by Ishihara have once again
seriously impaired the development of Sino-Japan relations, they
will undoubtedly cause indignation and alarm to the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
An out and out hawkish figure in the political circles of Japan
with ultra-rightist political leaning, Ishihara advocates the
revision of the Japanese Constitution of peace.
</P>
<P>
He stubbornly clung to the reactionary historical view, while
spouting odd opinions in respect to Japan's relations with China.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, Ishitara denied Japan's history of
aggression toward China. He also labeled the notorious 1937
Nanjing Massacre as a "lie fabricated by Chinese."
</P>
<P>
Even now, more than 50 years after the end of the Second World
War, he still addresses China by the name of "Sina," a derogatory
and discriminating name habitually used by the Japanese aggressor
troops during their war of aggression against China.
</P>
<P>
Ishitara's political statements and actions have been condemned
and despised by peace-loving Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
At this stage, it seems extraordinarily difficult for Ishihara
to change his political view. Since Ishihara is the current
governor of Japan's capital and a senior Japanese government
functionary, it is reasonable for him to comply with the Japanese
government's persistent policy on China, and keep his senses on
major issues relevant to the overall of China-Japan friendship.
</P>
<P>
We would like to advice Ishihara to earnestly study and adhere
to the principles and spirit set by the Sino-Japan Joint Statement
and the China-Japan Peace and Friendship Treaty, refrain from
releasing further statement that will hurt the Chinese people's
feeling or doing anything that will undermine the friendship for
generations to come between the Chinese and Japanese people.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's Antitrust Commission is likely to join in
a one billion shekels (about 250 million U.S. dollars)
class-action suit filed recently against several cable television
providers. The cable companies were charged of taking advantage
of their monopoly to set unfairly high fees for poor customer
service and inadequate channel offerings.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwaiti Minister of State for Housing Affairs
Jassem Al-Oun said Friday that about 11,000 new houses will be
ready for Kuwaiti applicants.
</P>
<P>
The Public Housing Authority has allocated contracts worth 40
million Kuwaiti dinars (about 132 million U.S. dollars) with
local companies to equip these residential units, Al-Oun said in
an interview with Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said that applicants for new houses have reached 50,000,
noting that the new houses will help ease growing demand for
housing by Kuwaiti families.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, which enforces a cradle-to-grave welfare policy,
provides free housing through different housing programs for
families and citizens covered by government housing care.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The slowdown in industry, construction, hotels,
transportation and communications continued into the first quarter
of 1999, said a poll of companies conducted by the Bank of
Israel. But trade companies reported stability and said they
expect increasing sales during the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The Lebanese government collected 187 billion pounds
(about 124 million U.S. dollars) from customs duties in March this
year, according to the country's customs authorities.
</P>
<P>
The March figure witnessed a 19 percent increase over that of
February and a 11 percent rise over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
But economists predicted that the revenues would fall from
April as the government imposed customs duties to up to 55 percent
on luxury items such as cheese, watches, alcohol and cigaretts.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Values Sino-Thai Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Both Thailand and China are ready
to work together to promote cooperation whether it is of
bilateral, multilateral or international level, Thai Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark during an interview with Chinese reporters
two days before he starts a visit to South Korea and China.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the 21st century is approaching, China and
Thailand has signed the Joint statement on a Plan of Action for
the 21st Century, which is the first agreement of its kind between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is an important step in promoting bilateral cooperation. We
will refer to it as a framework for our cooperation in the
future," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
China, the most populous country in the world, has a very
important role to play both in Asia and in the world at large, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Sino-Thai cooperation sends a signal to others so that
they can see the vision of both Thailand and China that we are two
countries that are ready to work together to promote development
whether it is of the bilateral, multilateral or international
level," Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
Chuan is expected to visit South Korea on Sunday before going
to China next Wednesday for a six-day official visit.

<HEADLINE> Ishihara Needs a China Trip: Leading Japanese Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A Leading Japanese newspaper, Asahi
Shimbun, published an editorial Friday advising new Tokyo Governor
Shintaro Ishihara to go to Beijing at an early date to better
understand China.
</P>
<P>
In response to Ishihara's remarks on the Taiwan issue, Asahi
Shimbun said that Ishihara should refrain from ignoring the "One
China" policy put forth in the 1972 Sino-China Joint Statement and
the 1978 China-Japan Peace and Friendship Treaty, and dampening
the friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The office of the Tokyo governor is not Ishihara's personal
property, the mass-circulated Japanese newspaper said, adding that
the damage done by Ishihara's imprudent statements would
eventually damage his ability to govern Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara, a ultra-rightist Japanese politician and writer,
flagrantly attacked the Chinese government and its policies on
Tibet and Taiwan in an interview with Japanese media after he was
elected Tokyo governor last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara, who once said he thought the notorious 1937 Rape of
Nanjing was a Chinese fabrication, said after the election that he
didn't mean it was a lie, but meant that he just did not believe
the number of people killed, the daily noted. The number of
people killed in the Rape of Nanjing, also known as the Nanjing
Massacre, has been estimated at 300,000.
</P>
<P>
In that case, why not go all the way to Nanjing, the daily
asked, adding that seeing the scene of the crime with an author's
eye for collecting historical proof would also help Ishihara
fulfill his duties as a governor.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara needs an early visit to Beijing as a governor to
frankly exchange opinions with Chinese, the daily said, adding
that whatever he might say will be not persuasive as long as he
keeps saying he does not want to visit China.

<HEADLINE> France Intercepts Yugoslav Registered Civilian Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A French Mirage warplane
intercepted Thursday in French air space a Yugoslav registered
civilian aircraft rented by a Greek company, said the official
Direction Generale de L'Aviation Civil (DGAC) Friday.
</P>
<P>
A Dutch made Fokker aircraft registered in Montenegro was
intercepted during its flight from Athens to Lyon with 75
passengers on board, said the DGAC.
</P>
<P>
The plane, rented by the Greek tourism company Princess, was
forced to land in Lyon after being intercepted, said officials.
</P>
<P>
The plane left Lyon Friday morning for Athens, and all its
passengers, most of them French from the region of Lyon on a trip
organized by an unidentified company, left the plane in a normal
way, they added.
</P>
<P>
The Montenegran newspaper Vijesti said Friday that two French
Mirage warplanes intercepted the Fokker because it carried the
inscription "YU."
</P>
<P>
The plane was flying to Paris, instead of Lyon, said the
newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Thanks China for Purchasing Farm Produce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
on Friday thanked China for purchasing agricultural products from
his country which faces difficulties.
</P>
<P>
This is not simply a trade matter and it reflects China's firm
friendship toward Thailand, Chuan said in an interview with
Chinese reporters in Bangkok two days before he starts a visit to
South Korea and China.
</P>
<P>
"This is something which Thai farmers and the Thai government
will always acknowledge," he said.
</P>
<P>
China has recently agreed to purchase 200,000 tons of rice,
100,000 tons of rubber and 200,000 tons of tapioca from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
As for economic cooperation between the two countries, Chuan
said what is important to economic cooperation is trade and
investment, in which bilateral cooperation has progressed well.
</P>
<P>
"Since the day we established diplomatic relations, the number
of Thai projects invested in China has increased from one to one
thousand. I believe further expansion will be seen in the
increasing cooperation in the field of investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said the trade volume between Thailand and China has
continued to increase over the years, which shows the potential
for trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the economic crisis began to hit the region, China has
been playing an important role in maintaining and promoting
stability of the region by not devaluating its currency, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said he believed there will be more areas of trade in
which the two countries can increase cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chuan is expected to leave on Sunday for Seoul for a three-day
visit to South Korea before going to Shanghai next Wednesday to
start a six-day official visit to China.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China's support for cooperation
among member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) has helped promote security in the region, Thai
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
China has played a very important role in various multilateral
or international organizations such as APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation) and ASEAN, of which China is a dialogue partner.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and China have enjoyed good cooperation and maintained
a good working relationship in such organizations, Chuan said in
an interview with Chinese reporters in Bangkok prior to his visit
to China next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
China has helped promote security in the region, which can be
seen from the assistance China extended when Asia faced the
financial crisis, Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
"Also, China has supportive cooperation within the framework of
ASEAN and within Asia. This is a good signal of cooperation, which
we are trying to promote as we approach the 21st century," he
said.
</P>
<P>
All the nine ASEAN countries are trading partners of China and
there is a very high volume of trade between China and ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
"Whether the Chinese economy improves will affect the (ASEAN)
countries economically. Therefore, we have to support the economic
cooperation between China and ASEAN," Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand also supports China's initiative to hold a meeting of
deputy finance ministers and deputy central bankers of Asia so
that they will be able to cooperate and exchange information as
well as help resolve and prevent the financial crisis from
happening again in the future, Chuan added.
</P>
<P>
"China itself has a very strong economy, and her international
reserves are huge. Therefore, any crisis or event (that) happens
will not affect China as much as it affected us," the prime
minister said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Police Brutality Sparks Controversy in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A BBC documentary on
incidents of South African police brutality has caused controversy
across the country.
</P>
<P>
The documentary, aired by the BBC on Monday night, showed
police officers punching, kicking, rifle-butting and setting dogs
on arrested suspects. Part of the documentary was screened by
South African television stations on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
While the violence was officially condemned and six officers
involved were suspended, ordinary citizens tend to look at the
other side of the story.
</P>
<P>
Riaan Smit was the original victim of one of the car hijacking
incidents filmed by the BBC.
</P>
<P>
Smit was hijacked on January 24 in downtown Johannesburg. He
was approached by an armed man when he stopped his car that night
to make a U- turn.
</P>
<P>
"I got out of the car, and he swore at me and told me not to
move. So I did what he said. He stood in front of me, aimed the
gun at my head and squeezed the trigger.
</P>
<P>
"Then he looked at the gun in surprise when it jammed, shook it
a bit, pointed it into my face and pulled the trigger again, and
still nothing happened," Smit recalled with horror.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker was then joined by an accomplice and fled with
Smit's white BMW. Smit phoned the anti-hijacking flying squad and
within 30 minutes his car was spotted.
</P>
<P>
In a car chase, the stolen car crashed. The BBC footage showed
police officers punching one unconscious hijacker, who was trapped
behind the steering wheel, and hitting another with rifle butt as
he lay next to the stolen car. A gun was found inside the car.
</P>
<P>
One of the suspects died in hospital. However, it is unknown
whether he died of the crash or the assault.
</P>
<P>
"Where was the camera when the guy pointed a gun in my face and
squeezed the trigger?" Smit asked.
</P>
<P>
"I am not saying that what the police did was right, but they
acted so quickly when they spotted my car, and after the arrest
they took my cellphone, ID book and personal items, and had them
returned to me. How bad can they be?"
</P>
<P>
Smit's attitude was not alone in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Citizen newspaper Thursday carried an article by its
well-known writer Brian Stuart, asking the frequently asked
question: why criminals' human rights are better protected than
those of law-abiding citizens?
</P>
<P>
Stuart could not hide his anger at the current criminal justice
system. He asked: "Why is an injured criminal treated in hospital
at state expense, but not the person he injured? Why is a rapist
entitled to legal defense, but not his victim?
</P>
<P>
"Why is he able to lay a charge of assault against any person
who dares defend themselves against him. Why is he not required to
recompense the person for the damage done?"
</P>
<P>
"All the privileges and safeguards are those accorded to the
violators of our human rights," he commented.
</P>
<P>
Most readers' letters carried by newspapers reflect the idea
that police brutality should not be condoned but certain acts are
understandable under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, the overwhelming majority of phone
calls to TV and radio stations showed sympathy with the police,
whom they believe work under extremely high level of stress.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a total of 223 policemen were killed while on duty
and more than 1,000 officers lost their lives since 1994.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has the world's highest rape rate and its murder
rate is only next to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, there is, on average, one
murder or attempted murder every 12 minutes and a rape every 26
seconds.
</P>
<P>
As pictures of the BBC footage could be easily compared to
scenes of apartheid-era police brutality, the authorities were
quick to condemn the incidents.
</P>
<P>
National Police Commissioner George Fivaz described the
incidents as " unacceptable and contrary to departmental
directives, our prevention of torture policy and our code of
conduct".
</P>
<P>
Gauteng provincial police commissioner, Sharma Maharaj, said
the scenes were "despicable acts of lawlessness, making a mockery
of our police service".
</P>
<P>
The officers involved have been suspended, the elite Brixton
anti- hijacking flying squad has been disbanded. An investigation
into the incidents has been launched.
</P>
<P>
However, as experts has pointed out, the problem lies with this
country' s criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
"To suspend six policemen is a simplistic solution. You need to
tackle the root cause of the problem, which lies in the criminal
justice system.
</P>
<P>
"Look at the impact of trauma and multiple exposure to so much
violence and crime, combined with the daily threat to life, and
balance that with the resulting behavior," said Mary Robertson, a
psychologist at the trauma clinic of the Center for the Study of
Violence and Reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Researcher at the center, David Bruce, said: "The police live
in a world of their own and daily come face-to-face with crime in
all its brutality, viciousness and violence. And they lack
confidence in the justice system and feel there is a lack of
seriousness from the government when it comes to tackling crime."
</P>
<P>
"The guys are left feeling that 'if we don't do something about
the problem, no one else will'."
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress government has refused to restore
the death penalty despite the fact that the majority of South
Africans favor the return of capital punishment. Nor it agrees to
hold a referendum on the issue.
</P>
<P>
It argues that such a move is against the constitution, which
states that everyone has the right to life, and that the death
penalty is not a deterrent to crime.
</P>
<P>
The death penalty was abolished shortly before the first
democratic elections in 1994.

<HEADLINE> IMF, World Bank to Strengthen HIPC Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and World Bank will take actions to strengthen the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, a senior IMF
official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tony Boote, in charge of the initiative at the IMF, said the
debt relief program for the world's most debt-ridden countries has
failed to live up to expectations and needs much work.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC Initiative, launched in the fall of 1996, represented
a major departure from past practice in dealing with debt problems
of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
It focused on achieving overall external debt-sustainability
with comprehensive participation by all external creditors for the
most heavily indebted countries with good track record.
</P>
<P>
The program initially promised debt relief to 23 countries,
with proposals to broaden it to 41 countries with total debt of
$200 billion.
</P>
<P>
However, just two countries, Bolivia and Uganda, have received
funds from the plan while only seven more have qualified for
debt-relief packages.

Critics said the tough criteria have excluded many countries,
slowed the process for years and failed to ensure debt relief.
</P>
<P>
"That is why we are trying to strengthen the initiative now and
that is why the international community is trying to work a more
effective program out," Boote said.
</P>
<P>
The program will be discussed next week at the annual spring
meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
In addition, five G-7 countries have made proposals for
changes to the program and it is expected to be discussed at the
G-7 Cologne Summit in June.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Russian FMs Hold Talks on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of Egypt and
Russia began talks here Friday evening on the latest developments
in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported that Amr Moussa and
Igor Ivanov are expected to focus their discussion on the peace
talks between the Palestinians and Israel, and the Palestinians'
possible declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he will declare an
independent Palestinian state on May 4 when the five-year interim
autonomy under the Oslo Accord signed with Israel in 1993 expires.
</P>
<P>
Russia, one of the co-sponsor of the peace process besides the
United States, supports Palestinians' right to self-determination
but has reportedly advised Arafat to postpone the declaration
until after Israel's elections on May 17 to avoid complicating the
peace-making march.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers will also tackle ways of promoting
bilateral relations in various domains, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Russia maintain close ties at both the political and
economic levels. Officials of the two countries often consult and
coordinate stances on international and regional issues of mutual
concern.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov arrived here earlier in the day as part a regional tour,
which has taken him to Israel and the Palestinian self-rule
areas. He will travel on to Syria and Lebanon after wrapping up
visit here.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON April 23 (Xinhua) - Weak opening on Wall Street sent
leaeding European markets to close mainly lower Friday despite
gains on telecommunication stocks boosted by hopes of further
mega-mergers in the sector.
</P>
<P>
UK blue chips were left with light gains at the close, as
positive sentiment from Wall Street's record close the day before
evaporated throughout the session.
</P>
<P>
An early bout of profit-taking on Wall Street accentuated the
drift, although the FTSE 100 did not appear in danger of slipping
into the red.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index closed 14.4 points higher at 6428.0, a gain
of 0.2 percent. The index remained in the black for the whole
session and saw a 6469.2 session high at 9.16am.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt's electronically-traded Xetra Dax failed to maintain
its grasp on early gains amid morning weakness on Wall Street. The
index ended down 0.74 percent at 5187.89. The Dax was up 0.8
percent for the week.

In Paris shares were also in the red as slim gains on opening

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Foreign Minister on Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya
Godana condemned the air strikes on Kosovo by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) here Friday in an interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Godana pointed out the practice that a group of countries
decided to ignore the United Nations and took military actions
against a sovereign country "is very frightening to a small
country like us because it reminds us of the evil gunboat
diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
"It is Yugoslavia today, and could be any other country
tomorrow," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He added that any forcibly menace or any military action by a
group of states must be legitimatized through authorization by the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"We are in an international organization -- the United Nations
-- committed to the purpose of maintaining international peace and
security," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Since NATO was founded as a collective defensive alliance and
there was no aggression from Yugoslavia, it is not justified for
the NATO to launch military actions against Yugoslavia," Godana
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the air strikes were against "not just
military targets but increasingly non-military civilian projects,
finally broadcasting stations and bridges."

<HEADLINE> UK Set To Escape Economic Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain looks set to escape an
economic recession, but growth would be sluggish for some time,
official figures showed Friday.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product is estimated to have grown by 0.1
percent in the first three months of this year compared with the
previous quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics.
</P>
<P>
At an annual rate, the UK economy is growing by 0.7 percent -
under the government's forecast of growth of 1-1.5 percent for the
year.
</P>
<P>
The six interest rate cuts by the Bani of England appear to
have improved business and consumer confidence and reinvigorated
the business.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector is still suffering, but the service
sector, which now makes up three-quarters of the economy, grew by
0.4 percent, at an annual rate of 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Neil Parker, economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said:
"Although 0.1 percent growth is nothing to shout about, it is
likely to represent the slowest growth this year, since we expect
a consumer led recovery to lead to stronger growth later."

<HEADLINE> Four People Killed in Plane Crash in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Another person died in hospital,
bringing the death toll to four in a civilian plane crash in
Israel Saturday morning, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, which belongs to a sky diving school, crashed in
a hillside near a cooperative farm near the northern port city of
Haifa, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Ten people were aboard the plane, one pilot and nine sky
divers. The six injured are being treated in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Initial investigation found that there might be a mechanical
malfunction in the plane, according to the radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Before the crash, the plane diverted from its planned course
and it appeared that the pilot had attempted to make an emergency
landing on a coastal highway.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the diving school was quoted by the radio as
saying that the pilot is a veteran airman and the Swiss-made plane
was well-maintained and had been checked before the flight
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said there is no black box in the plane.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Coach: We Can Still Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Despite the almost landslide favors
for a Spanish win at the FIFA World YOuth Championship, Japan's
French coach Philippe Troussier still kept a high profile saying
that "we can still win."
</P>
<P>
"We respect Spain but, even so, we can still win, " Troussier
said just less than 20 hours before the final match between Japan
and Spain.
</P>
<P>
"The whole of Japan is happy .... and I am happy because I
never thought we would get this far in the competition," said the
"white witch doctor".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Spanish coach, Inaki Saez Ruiz, seems to share
Troussier' s feeling of leading his team to such a surprising
position, after seeing the kicks-out of such big names as Brazil,
Portugal, Argentina, Germany and England.
</P>
<P>
"Before the tournament, this was unthinkable," said Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
But with all its tradition and history in soccer, Spain seems
to be above Japan in many people's eyes when the two clash in
Lagos in hours.
</P>
<P>
"Playing a team like Japan increases our chances of winning,
admittedly, but we can't sell the bearskin before killing the bear,
" Ruiz said.
</P>
<P>
But while both sides are surprised to see each other in the
final, the two have earned their chance with a similar confidence
by distinct, vigorous playing styles.
</P>
<P>
After losing its opener to Cameroon 2-1, the Japanese haven't
lost since, beating the United States, England, Portugal (on
penalties), Mexico and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Spain, which is making its first appearance in the U-20 World
Cup final since losing the 1985 title game to Brazil, had a
similar march: losing 2-0 to Brazil, drawing with Zambia, before
beating Honduras, the United States, Ghana (on penalties) and Mali.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that "the pressure is on Spain, " Troussier said that
Japan "has already won by just getting to the final and knowing
that we at least have the silver."
</P>
<P>
Troussier, who had coached in Africa for many years, was
deprived of his job as the Nigerian team's coach last year after
Nigeria's "Super Eagle" performed "badly" to many Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
The "white witch doctor" won his fame back to some extend when
thousands of Nigerian fans chanted "we want Troussier" when his
Japanese boys beat Uruguay 2-1 at the semi-final.

<HEADLINE> China Deals Harshly with Abuse of Treasury Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Finance (MOF) and
the State Development Planning Commission (SDPC) are to stop
allocating any more treasury funds to east China's Jiangxi
Province because of alleged misuse of such funds.
</P>
<P>
During a recent investigation, the MOF discovered that a number
of regions in Jiangxi have defrauded the central government by
establishing projects which exist in name only.
</P>
<P>
Some regions have also diverted funds earmarked for special
projects without permission from the central government. In
addition, fake accounts and contracts were drawn up in order to
conceal the truth.
</P>
<P>
The MOF and SDPC decided to halt the allocation of funds for
projects apart from water conservancy and others that have high
level approval until these issues are cleared up.
</P>
<P>
They have urged the provincial government to severely punish
officials involved in the scams.
</P>
<P>
They have also demanded all other regions in the country learn
a lesson from these cases and strengthen their management and
supervision of state funds.
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Jiangxi province are currently investigating the
cases and will be recommending action.

<HEADLINE> Violence Erupts as Kenyan Opposition Supporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people were injured
Saturday in the fighting between supporters of two rival
opposition leaders in Ugenya district, Nyanza province in west
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Violence erupted just as Raila Odinga started a fund-raising
rally in the constituency of his rival member of parliament James
Orengo of Ford-Kenya. The rally was considered by the followers of
Orengo as a plot to undermine the political influence of Orengo.
</P>
<P>
The rally was disrupted by Orengo's supporters and deteriorated
into a fighting so turbulent that Kenyan police fired in the air
as to control the situation, according to reports reaching here
from the province.
</P>
<P>
One supporter of Orengo was admitted to hospital after being
beaten up. A policeman was also seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Orengo, a lawyer, is seen as a staunch critic of the
government, while Odinga serves as leader of the National
Development Party, which formed an informal alliance last year
with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi's ruling party KANU.
</P>
<P>
Both Odinga and Orengo command a high degree of respect in
Nyanza province with inhabitants of the Luo tribe, the second
biggest tribe in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Police had blocked Ugenya town to stop Orengo staging his own
parallel rally, which had been banned by a government decree.
</P>
<P>
The conflict between the two prominent political figures in
Kenya has been the front-page news stories of local newspapers
this week. The leading newspaper Daily Nation said Saturday that
this was a disgrace over Ugenya rally.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Supports Political Settlement for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Saturday that his country supports political
settlement for the Kosovo crisis in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting between President Hosni Mubarak and visiting
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, Moussa told reporters that
Egypt and Russia share stances on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
"We are all interested in a political settlement, the need to
respect the (Yugoslav) sovereignty and territorial integrity and
reject any policy of ethnic cleansing or the violation of the
basic rights of the people of Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovar refugees must safely return to their homes within
an acceptable formula in accordance with international law, he
added.
</P>
<P>
NATO has been bombing Yugoslav targets since March 24 to force
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept a peace plan
which will allow the alliance to deploy troops in the southern
Serbian province of Kosovo as peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians have fled Kosovo to
neighboring Albania and Macedonia after NATO launched the
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
During the hour-long talks, Mubarak also discussed with Ivanov
the latest developments in the Middle East peace process and ways
of promoting bilateral ties, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov arrived in Cairo Friday evening within a regional tour,
which has taken him to Israel and the Palestinian self-rule
areas. He will then travel to Syria and Lebanon after wrapping up
visit here.
</P>
<P>
"We have exchanged views on international issues and our
bilateral relations and the talks have clearly shown that Egypt
and Russia are linked in many ways," said the Russian minister.
</P>
<P>
"We build our relations on the agreements reached in 1997
during President Mubarak's visit in Moscow and the talks he held
with (Russian) President (Boris) Yeltsin," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister added that he briefed Mubarak on his
country's efforts to defuse the crisis in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
He called on all parties to show political determination to
reach a political settlement for the Kosovo crisis, saying that
Russia will exert efforts with other countries to seek a
solution.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Economic Situation Stabilized: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's economic situation
has stabilized and the signs of economic revival were quite
visible, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Dar said the first three
quarters of the current fiscal year ending on June 30, 1999 posted
encouraging results on different economic fronts.
</P>
<P>
The government retired domestic debt of 43 billion rupees (935
million U.S. dollars) in the first nine months of this year
against a bank borrowing of 41 billion rupees (891 million
dollars) in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
He also said monetary expansion in the first three quarters of
the current fiscal year was maintained at 3.3 percent in the wake
of tight monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Despite difficulties, he said, the revenue collection during
the first nine months of the current fiscal year amounted to 203.8
billion rupees (4.43 billion dollars), two percent higher than
last year's 199.7 billion rupees (4.34 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said the reduction in imports resulted in a decline of
revenue from import-related taxes such as custom duties, sales tax
and income tax.
</P>
<P>
Curtailment in development expenditure also resulted in lower
collection from direct and indirect taxes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the first three quarters as the most difficult
period in the country's history, he said Pakistan was subjected to
external shocks of unprecedented nature which created serious
economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"The export prices of major agricultural commodities and raw
materials have collapsed," Dar said. "Pakistan, being a part of
the global economy, cannot remain wholly immune to these
unfavorable development."
</P>
<P>
But he said the government's effective economic and financial
management had led the country out of the crisis in a relatively
shorter period of time compared with East Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Positive Signs of Economic Improvement Emerge in HK (1) By Tao Wenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Positive signs of improvement
in the economic situation in Hong Kong have been emerging recently,
including the falling interest rates, the rebound in stock and
property prices and the increasing inflow of foreign capital and
overseas visitors.
</P>
<P>
However, the unemployment rate remains high while the value of
external trade is still on a downtrend.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Association of Banks earlier this month announced
its sixth deposit rates cut since October last year. In the
meantime, Hong Kong's major banks also reduced their prime lending
rates by 0.25 percent to 8.5 percent, the lowest level in two
years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the rates cut is a boost to investor
confidence by way of lowering the cost for loans and would help
speed up Hong Kong's recovery process by pumping local money from
banks to the stock and property markets.
</P>
<P>
Specialists say there is still room for a further rate
reduction.
</P>
<P>
Share prices have seen sharp growth in the past weeks due to
heavy inflow of local and overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
Although the stocks failed to break the 13,000 point level at
the last minutes to the end of the week's trading session on
Friday, the share prices surged 3.32 percent in the week following
a leap of nearly 5 percent in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip Hang Seng Index hit its highest level since
October 20, 1997 at 13,364.42 during the morning session on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Daily turnover rose up to above 10 billion HK dollars (1.28
billion U.S. dollars) in the week except on Wednesday. On Monday
and Friday turnovers reached nearly 15 billion Hong Kong dollars (
1.92 billion U.S. dollars), the highest ones since August last
year.
</P>
<P>
China-related stocks also enjoyed strong growth this week, with
the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index and the China affiliated
enterprises index growing by 11.78 percent and 10.42 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The inflow of large amount of foreign as well as local money
into the stock market reflects the level of investor confidence in
the economic prospect of Hong Kong, a regional financial center
and a gateway for foreign investors to enter the market of China's
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Asian economies hit by the financial turmoil are expected to
begin to recover in 1999 and the pace of economic growth in
China's mainland remains very firm.
</P>
<P>
As overseas investors believe China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) will take place this year, they have good
reasons to seize business opportunities in Hong Kong, the first
step to do business with firms on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
However, some experts say Hong Kong's share prices have been
overvalued and that there are some bubbles in the stock market.
The market could be volatile around the current level for a period
of time before the complete recovery of Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the resumption of government land sales on April 20
was believed to be a boost to the local property market.
</P>
<P>
The land auction, conducted 10 months after the government
decided to suspend land sales in June 1998, achieved encouraging
results by raising 1.49 billion HK dollars (190 million U.S.
dollars) with a total of over 26,000 square meters of government
lots.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the better-than-expected prices demonstrate that
developers are confident of the development of the property market.
</P>
<P>
The sales gave an immediate push to property prices, with flat
owners raising asking prices in the second-hand market by 5 to 10
percent while developers rushed to put more homes on the market.
</P>
<P>
In the mean time, some developers said the prices were too high.
They fear that high property prices would dent HK's
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The government has promised to continue to provide sufficient
land supply to keep property prices stable.
</P>
<P>
The land sales were suspended at the end of June last year in
an effort to stabilize the sharply falling property prices which
had plunged by about 50 percent forced by the soaring interest
rates as a result of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
While the sharp fall in property prices might be good for home
buyers, it created problems for small and medium-sized enterprises,
accounting for more than 90 percent of firms in Hong Kong, who use
their properties as mortgages to get loans from banks.
</P>
<P>
The rebound in stock and property prices is usually faster than
the improvement of the unemployment and external trade situation.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate for January-March 1999 stood at 6.2
percent. The value of re-export and domestic export dropped by 10.
1 percent and 9.9 percent respectively in February compared with
the same month of last year while the value of import fell 24.9
percent.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Israel's Threat to Close Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Saturday condemned the Israeli
threat to close certain Palestinian offices in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Iran officially recognizes Palestinians' rights to hold
sovereignty on Jerusalem and castigates the Israeli policies and
measures in judaizing the holy city and removing identity of its
Islamic-Palestinian edifices, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Israeli measures would make the region
insecure and escalate regional crisis, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Citing Israel as the main cause of crisis in the region,
the spokesman called on international community and Muslim
countries to confront the aggressive policies of the Israeli
government.
</P>
<P>
The recent measures of the Israeli regime showed that
compromise talks and leniency towards the regime would make it
more greedy and would bring nothing but humiliation for the
Palestinian people, he added.

MANILA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- World Boxing Council (WBC)

<HEADLINE> Iran Dismisses Human Rights Resolution as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Saturday termed a
resolution of the U.N. Human Rights Commission on the country's
human rights status as "politically motivated and illegitimate."
</P>
<P>
The resolution is another proof that the Commission's reviewing
process of human rights situation in different countries is a
political move, the Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hamid Reza
Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Human Rights Commission at an annual session in
Geneva on Friday passed a motion proposed by the European Union
(EU), expressing concerns about human rights abuses in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran, upholding its Islamic and cultural values, tries to
promote human rights of its citizens, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Iran maintains that the resolution has no basis for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The resolution with pre-determined political objectives has
failed to reflect the realities of the dynamic society of the
Islamic Republic of Iran, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
As before, it is seeking to raise groundless allegations
against Iran, he said. And the initiators of the resolution
overtly and officially resorted to all political and economic
leverage to attract other countries' votes against Iran.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also expressed pleasure with the oppositive
voices of many countries, including member states of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), Non-Aligned Movement
(NAM) and several independent developing countries to the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
He said that these countries opposed the resolution and
welcomed a proposal to end monitoring human rights conditions in
Iran.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Positive Signs of Economic Improvement Emerge in HK (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the past months, foreign investors have shown great interest
in Hong Kong's telecommunication sector.
</P>
<P>
American software giant Microsoft announced last month in Hong
Kong its "strategic cooperation" with Hong Kong's major full-
service communications provider Hongkong Telecom in developing
high-speed broadband services that will allow Hong Kong to fully
experience the convergence of low-cost personal computer and
telecommunications technologies.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, during a visit to Hong Kong,
also expressed interest in participating in the planned Cyberport
project in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The 13 billion HK dollar (1.7 billion U.S. dollar) Cyberport
project was announced by Financial Secretary Donald Tsang in his
budget address on March 3 with an aim to boost the development of
Hong Kong's information industry.
</P>
<P>
World leading Internet media company Yahoo signed an agreement
this month with Hong Kong's SmarTone Mobile Communications to
provide content for SmarTone's soon-to-be-launched Internet
service.
</P>
<P>
Yahoo Chief Jerry Yang confirmed that the group's Greater China
headquarters would be located in Hong Kong, and expressed its
intention to be part of the Cyberport effort.
</P>
<P>
On April 8, the British Telecommunications (BT) announced that
it would buy 20 percent of the enlarged shares of SmarTone.
</P>
<P>
The move by BT, one of the largest telecommunication companies
in the world, represents a 3-billion-HK dollar (384.6 million U.S.
dollars) investment in SmarTone, which makes BT SmarTone's second
largest shareholder.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry is among the first in Hong Kong to walk
out of the shadow of the Asian financial turmoil. The total number
of visitors to Hong Kong was 861,347 in March this year, a 12.4
percent increase over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The fairs and exhibitions held recently in Hong Kong have also
been successful. There were a record 46,000 visitors to the
largest giftware trade fair in Asia -- the Hong Kong Gifts and
Houseware Fair '99 and the Hong Kong Premium Fair '99,
representing an increase of 18.3 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the Hong Kong Policy Research
Institute on Economic Confidence Index on April 19 and 20 showed
that average public confidence in Hong Kong's economic situation
or "Prospects of Hong Kong" rose 8.1 points compared with a
similar survey conducted in March.
</P>
<P>
The confidence index of "Improvement on Unemployment Situation'
was 29.9 points higher than in March amidst the public's upbeat
approach towards the economic prospects of Hong Kong, brought
about by the successful land auction, and especially Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji's recent successful visit to the United States
and progress in the negotiations over China's entry into the WTO.

<HEADLINE> Somali Kidnappers Set $100,000 Ransom for Italian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Somali gunmen demanded 100,000
U.S. dollars for the release of the kidnapped Italian aid worker
of the Terra Nuova, threatening that they "will take an emergency
decision unless something quick is done in the next 48 hours. "
</P>
<P>
Marwas Yareh Hassan, gunmen spokesman, made the threat in an
interview with Xinhua reporter through VHF radio, but he has
refused to elaborate what kind of decision they are likely to
take.
</P>
<P>
The Somali gunmen kidnapped Stefano Sotgia, an Italian
veterinarian aid worker for the Terra Nuova a week ago in the town
of Hagar, 165 kilometers northwest of the southern port city of
Kismayu .
</P>
<P>
The spokesman accused Terra Nuova for being responsible of the
death of over 2,500 heads of cattle in the past 46 days.
</P>
<P>
He said that Terra Nuova had sent a message to the region two
months ago that a large vaccination campaign would be launched in
the area and therefore all herds be collected in Hagar and
Qalawaley village for the vaccination.
</P>
<P>
"All of the nomads were notified of the chance and everyone had
brought their cattle to the designated vaccine sites," said
Hassan.
</P>
<P>
"But unfortunately, Terra Nuova did not show up and day after
day, week after week, the cows had begun dying in dozens for lack
of grazing and water accompanied by killer diseases," he added.
</P>
<P>
In finding a solution to the problem, Hassan said his men had
held a meeting and made the decision that Terra Nuova should pay
100,000 U.S. dollars for the safe release of the Italian aid
worker and the Somali officer of Hagar town.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman explained that 60,000 U.S. dollars will be for
the compensation of the dead cattle while the other 40,000 dollars
is a fine for the grave mistake Terra Nuova had committed against
what he called the impoverished innocent nomads.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen said the Terra Nuova office in Nairobi and elders
from the region had contacted them over the release of the men.
However, some misunderstanding had occurred which had further
complicated the situation after self-proclaimed delegates had
given out false information about their attitude regarding the
hostage taking.
</P>
<P>
The local elders said there's now quite a few chances in which
they can intervene into the situation.
</P>
<P>
The kidnapped Italian Sotgia told this reporter through the VHF
radio in Hagar Saturday afternoon that he is " so far being
treated well, being fed well and given enough water in a house. "
</P>
<P>
Sotgia said, with very serious and cautious voice, "I have no
medicine, but I am doing fine."
</P>
<P>
The Italian aid worker asked his organization, Terra Nuova, to
accelerate their efforts in securing his safe release.
</P>
<P>
"I just want my organization to find a solution to this
problem quickly, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Abshir Abdullahi Hassan, head of the Terra Nuova office in
Hagar, is also being kept as a hostage in the same place with his
superior, Dr Stefano Sotgia. Abshir is also being blamed for his
role in spreading false information about the expected activities
of Terra Nuova.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: European States, U.S. Remain Different on Future NATO Concept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States and its major
European allies in the 19-nation NATO, which also includes France,
remain divided on NATO's strategic concept for the future.
</P>
<P>
In addition to discussing the crisis in Yugoslavia, the NATO
Washington summit, which started on Friday and is being held in
Washington D.C., the U.S. capital, is dedicated to amending the
alliance's strategic concept for the next century.
</P>
<P>
At the insistence of France, NATO will reportedly keep the
spirit of its 1991 strategic concept, which stipulates that any
NATO action should be in conformity with the principles of the U.N.
Charter.
</P>
<P>
There are many signs to indicate that the United States and its
European allies differ in varying degrees on the strategic concept
of the U.S.-led Western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
The United States seemingly wants to turn NATO into a powerful
tool for safeguarding its global interests, but European countries
wish to insure more independent decision-making powers within NATO,
and to give it a "European identity of defense and security."
</P>
<P>
France and some other Western European countries are opposed to
turning NATO into a "world policeman" and into a "holy alliance"
entitled to act anywhere and everywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
If NATO becomes a world policeman, the United States would be
able to stage military operations anywhere with the support of its
strong military power and presence.
</P>
<P>
It will undoubtedly serve the interests of Washington to be
able to impose its policy of power over others since it is the
only remaining superpower to emerge following the end of the Cold
War era.
</P>
<P>
Although Europe shares the same values and common strategic
interests to a great extent with the United States, it is also
interested in seeing the world move toward a multipolarity instead
of a single polar, structure.
</P>
<P>
With the construction of European integrity, marked by the
birth of the single currency euro, Europe sees the need to develop
a stronger political and military identity.
</P>
<P>
The difference between European countries and the United States
is observable through NATO's on-going war against Yugoslavia. The
United States is using Yugoslavia to test its plan to turn NATO
into a global policeman with few or no restrictions or limitations,
including the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Although France and other European countries are following the
U.S. lead in the war against Yugoslavia, they regard NATO's action
as a strict exception to the rules of international relations.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting of the NATO ambassadors council in Brussels this
week, European countries expressed their opposition to an
abdication of the prerogatives of the United Nations Security
Council over NATO.
</P>
<P>
Before going to Washington to attend the NATO summit, which is
also marking the 50th anniversary of its founding, French
President Jacques Chirac called for an "acceleration of the
establishment of a European defense."
</P>
<P>
He said the Washington summit should be a new step toward the
building of a European defense, rather than a step back.
</P>
<P>
Even Britain, the closest ally of the U.S. in Europe, expressed
its support to the idea of building a European defense system at
the Franco-British summit last year in Saint Malo.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said recently that Europe
needs to speak with one voice and to establish its own decision-
making mechanism on security.
</P>
<P>
The differences existing between the allies on both sides of
the Atlantic over the future of NATO will surely exert a major
impact on the evolution of relations between the two sides in the
future, as well as the evolution of NATO itself.

Delegates said that the implementation of the law will provide
a legal framework within which doctors can work, guarantee their
rights and develop China's medical system.

loans for students, saying his cabinet had agreed not to make any
change to the policy of scholarships.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch ceremony of Singapore 21, a vision for
Singapore in the 21st century, Goh said he did not "favor the
replacement of scholarships with loans for our brighter students."
</P>
<P>
"The government will continue to give only scholarships for
courses of study in areas where the state thinks it needs talent
and expertise," Goh said. His remarks drew applause from
participants.
</P>
<P>
"Many parents and students would no doubt find tuition loans
attractive as they give students the freedom to decide on their
choice of university course," he said. "But the government should
not use public funds for an individual's self-fulfillment. They
should be used for national interests."
</P>
<P>
His comment came just days after Deputy Prime Minister and
Defense Minister Tony Tan made a suggestion that Singapore should
seriously consider scrapping government scholarships.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the United States last week, Tan suggested
study loans should replace scholarships with exceptions in the
Armed Forces and Administrative Services.
</P>
<P>
Tan reportedly said scholarships were "silly" because they
force employers to hold positions for scholars, who may not like
to join them after their studies or who may not turn out to be the
best people for the job.
</P>
<P>
Referring to loan funds, Tan said students can borrow funds to
go abroad to study and the arrangement allows both employers and
scholars to make a decision after a long course of study.
</P>
<P>
In his speech Saturday, Prime Minister Goh said Singapore 21, a
final report developed by the Singapore 21 Committee after
consultations with thousands of Singaporeans at different levels,
represents the ideas and views about the kind of future society
many Singaporeans want for themselves.
</P>
<P>
Singapore 21 identifies five apparent dilemmas or future
challenges Singaporeans will have to resolve, and also five key
ideas to resolve the dilemmas.
</P>
<P>
Goh said Singapore 21 is about forging new partnerships in
society. "The public sector creates conditions for the growth and
development of Singapore while the private sector creates wealth
for the country."
</P>
<P>
"In addition," he said, "there is the people sector, made up of
all the social, community and voluntary groups."
</P>
<P>
"This sector provides the avenues for Singaporeans to
contribute to bringing about the kind of Singapore they wish to
have for themselves and their children," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the new millennium, we need a strong public sector, a
vibrant private sector and a dynamic people sector working
together to secure the future of Singapore," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Russian Envoy Repeats Claim Over Yugoslav Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Balkans envoy Viktor
Chernomyrdin repeated Saturday Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's statement that he had agreed to "the deployment in
Kosovo of an international force with extensive participation of
Russia."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said the West doesn't understand what had been
discussed during his trip to Belgrade on Thursday and shouldn't be
so quick to dismiss the latest proposal.
</P>
<P>
Western leaders "don't know what Milosevic and I agreed upon.
When I meet with them, I will inform them and explain (Milosevic's)
position. And only then will we talk about their reaction," the
former Russian prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
But he sidestepped questions about a claim he made that
Milosevic had agreed to a military force.
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing to add or change what I said yesterday,"
Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
Those allegations have been denied by Yugoslavia. Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said Chernomyrdin and Milosevic
hadn't even talked about the possibility of an international
military presence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Valentin Sergeyev, a Chernomyrdin aide, said
Chernomyrdin hadn't been talking about an armed military force but
only about "people dressed in military uniforms" as part of an
otherwise civilian mission.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin's peace plan was also dismissed by western leaders
because it didn't mention the full withdrawal of Yugoslav forces
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister, who was appointed special Balkans
envoy earlier this month, ruled out Russia's military involvement
in the Yugoslav crisis and said he wanted to discuss with Western
leaders ways of ending the violence.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need to frighten people with warships. There is a
danger that we might slide into a third world war, and that would
be the last war," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Russia will convince the two sides to come to a peaceful
solution. Yugoslavia has already made compromises. Now I shall
talk with NATO."
</P>
<P>
Russia sent a reconnaissance ship to the Adriatic to monitor
the Yugoslav crisis, but President Boris Yeltsin has made clear he
will not be pushed into armed confrontation with the West.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, there must be wide autonomy for Kosovo, and
President Milosevic has also agreed with this. This is very
important," Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
"The main thing now is to organize the negotiating process
between the Yugoslav side and the ethnic Albanian leaders."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said Russia had a key role to play as mediator
between Yugoslavia, ethnic Albanians and NATO.
</P>
<P>
He said he was ready to fly to Washington, Bonn and other
Western capitals in the coming days to brief the leaders of NATO
countries on his talks with Milosevic.

<HEADLINE> Boom in Ashes Scattering on the Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Traditional funerals where
bodies are buried are becoming a thing of the past in China as
more and more people opt for scattering the ashes of their loved
ones in the sea.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau said that
increasing numbers of Beijingers are requesting permissions for
the sea-board farewell to the dead even years after they died.
</P>
<P>
For example, 83-year-old Wang Ruikun today scattered the ashes
of his wife who died three years ago and those of his second son
who passed away six year ago into the Bohai Sea just off Tianjin,
north China's largest port city.
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by his first son and granddaughter and other
relatives, the short frail man said without hesitation: "I've
decided to have my ashes treated this way, too."
</P>
<P>
Along with Wang today were also 237 Beijing residents, who made
the three-hour journey to the sea to participate in a collective
ashes-scattering ceremony. And thus it was that the ashes of 92
souls were cast into the sea accompanied by flower petals in the
ceremony, which took about an hour.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the bureau approved the scattering of the ashes of
529 souls into the Bohai Sea, up 53 percent over 1997. Every year
over 70,000 people die in the Chinese capital of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Anticipating further growth in the demand for this new trend,
the bureau plans to organise at least six collective ashes-
scattering trips this year," said Zhang Wanxing, head of the
bureau's funeral and internment section.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the bureau has organized 15 similar
events involving the ashes of 2,113 dead people.
</P>
<P>
The bureau conducts the sea trips purely for the benefit of
society and only charges each person traveling for transportation
and a lunch plus a token fee of 300 yuan (around 36 US dollars).
If no relatives are available to scatter the ashes, the bureau
clerks will do it under the jurisdiction of the notary office, for
a charge of 100 yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, the bureau is not the first to jump on this trendy
funeral bandwagon, for the privately-owned Beijing Peaceful Soul
Service Company started the craze with the city's first ashes-
scattering event in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Peaceful Soul commissioned Chinese composer Wang Xilin to
write a "Requiem" musical piece with Chinese characteristics.
Apart from inviting professional orchestras to play the music, the
company's elaborate ceremonies also include strewing the "
homeland's soil and water", letting pigeons loose in the sky and
burning firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the fees for transportation and a meal, the
company charges 1,000 yuan for each customer. However, because it
is hidden away at a corner of the Zhongshan Park at the west side
of the Tiananmen Rostrum, the company has failed to attract enough
customers to be profitable. It has been kept afloat by the 50-year-
old boss Zhang Kai's money-spinning efforts which include a
dismantling, packaging and transport business.
</P>
<P>
Bao Yuan, an expert on funerals and internment from the
Ministry of Civil Affairs, said that major coastal cities from
Guangzhou in the south to Dalian and Dandong in the north are also
leading torch-bearers in the emerging new custom.
</P>
<P>
He said that putting one's ashes in the trust of the sea is
actually the second revolution in China's history of funerals and
interment.
</P>
<P>
The first revolution broke out in 1956, when Mao Zedong and 150
other central and provincial government officials agreed to be
cremated, according to the expert.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the cremation rate in China is 39 percent with
Beijing's rate being a massive 98 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Explodes Near U.S., British Consulates in Russian City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A bomb exploded Saturday outside a
building housing the U.S. and British consulates in Yekaterinburg,
causing no casualties.
</P>
<P>
The blast, which occurred at about 6 a.m. (0000GMT), blew out
windows in the surrounding buildings, the local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was placed in a bag under a car parked 10 meters from
the consulates, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Police did not know if the explosion in Yekaterinburg -- about
1,500 kilometers east of Moscow -- was connected to U.S. and
British involvement in NATO airstrikes in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Anti-western sentiment has been on the rise around Russia since
NATO started airstrikes against Yugoslavia on March 24.
Demonstrations were held outside the U.S. embassy in central
Moscow in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, a gunman fired at the U.S. embassy in protest
against the air raids on Yugoslavia, but no one was injured.

<HEADLINE> French Troops Begin Re-Deployment South of Tirana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- French troops stationed in the
airport of the Albanian capital Tirana began to re-deploy toward
the south on Saturday in preparation for NATO's "Allied Shelter"
humanitarian mission for Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted officers of the French Army
in Albania as saying that the first group of about 50 French
soldiers had moved to Elbasan, 55 kilometers south of Tirana,
where the base of the Task Force South is located, one of the four
NATO contingents for "Allied Shelter."
</P>
<P>
France has already sent 300 soldiers to the airport of Rinas in
Tirana over the past few week, and will send 450 soldiers to
reinforce the "Allied Shelter" mission next week.
</P>
<P>
Some French tanks will also arrive next Tuesday at the port of
Durres, southern Albania, said the AFP.
</P>
<P>
Task Force South is under the commander of France and will have
a total of 1,300 soldiers from France, Denmark, Greece and the
United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
NATO said that the "Allied Shelter" will have two other bases --
one in northern Albania, and another in the Durres region, to
serve as a transit point for NATO soldiers and equipment.
</P>
<P>
A total of 7,000 NATO soldiers are participating in the "Allied
Shelter" operation.

<HEADLINE> France, U.S. Reach Agreement on Legality of Future NATO Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- France and the United States have
reached an agreement that future NATO actions should be performed
in conformity with the principles of the United Nations, according
to a report by Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The AFP quoted unidentified U.S. and NATO sources as saying on
Saturday in Washington that the agreement, reached by President
Jacques Chirac and President Bill Clinton Friday night, is not far
from the last (NATO) strategic concept of 1991, which stresses
that the alliance should act in conformity with U.N. principles.
</P>
<P>
The 1991 NATO strategic concept says that it is the "
fundamental tasks" of NATO to "safeguard the freedom and security
of all its members by political and military means, in conformity
with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
No further details about the agreement can be obtained
immediately, said the AFP.
</P>
<P>
The NATO Washington summit, which opened on Friday, is expected
to adopt a new strategic concept.

<HEADLINE> China Manufactures CFC Substitute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China's first production line of R-
134a, a freezing agent substitute for the environmentally damaging
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), went into operation here today.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that 200 tons of R-134a will be produced every
year and a second phase of the project will produce 5,000 tons
when completed.
</P>
<P>
It has been unequivocally proved that CFC, used widely in the
world's cooling industry, is gradually destroying the planet's
ozone layer, leading to "greenhouse effects".
</P>
<P>
According to international agreements, the world's developed
countries ceased producing and using ozone-depleting materials in
1996, and the deadline for developing countries is 2010.
</P>
<P>
China has announced that it would stop producing this kind of
product by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The new substitute, which is being produced by the Xi'an-Jinzu
Modern Chemical Industry Co. Ltd., is expected to contribute to
China's realization of that goal.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Shed Loss-Making Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China's largest industrial city
of Shanghai is determined to reduce by 15 percent the number of
big and medium-sized loss-making enterprises by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
 At present, about 35 percent of the state-owned or state-
holding companies in the city are in the red, according to the
municipal government.
</P>
<P>
 Once the 15 percent target is realized, about 400 enterprises
would free themselves from the current difficulties.
</P>
<P>
 To provide a better external environment for the enterprises,
the government has set up a special unit to coordinate policies
and the allocation of resources.
</P>
<P>
 Shanghai has every confidence it can meet this target, a city
official said, and there has appeared a favorable deficit-cutting
trend in the city since last year.
</P>
<P>
 In the first two months of the year, the city's industrial
enterprises recorded 2.2 billion yuan (260 million U.S. dollars)
profit, up 31.3 percent over the same period of last year, the
official said.

WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The sports marketing firm

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Political Solution to Afghan Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Saturday called for an end to the
fighting in Afghanistan and for a political solution to the
Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
Asefi voiced Tehran's concerns over the escalation of conflicts
in Afghanistan and expressed regret that the Afghan Taliban
militia refused to continue peace talks with the opposition
Northern Alliance, led by the ousted Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored Afghan peace talks were held in Ashkhabad,
Turkmenistan in February and March, but the Taliban did not take
part in the follow-up negotiations on April 12.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that Taliban militia clashed with
the Northern Alliance in the past week in the Bamian region, the
main center for the Afghan Shiite Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Resorting to force and refusing to hold peace talks will bring
nothing, the Iranian spokesman said, stressing the need for
resumption of peace talks between the Afghan groups to form a
broad-based government in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Voicing support for efforts of the United Nations to bring
peace to Afghanistan, he also highlighted the need to implement
the resolutions of the U.N. Security Council, the U.N. General
Assembly and the "6 plus 2" formed by Afghanistan's six neighbors
as well as Russia and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The resolutions called for peaceful settlement of the Afghan
civil war and the establishment of a broad-based government in
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Italian Aid Worker Kidnapped in Somalia "Treated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Italian veterinarian aid
worker, Dr Stefano Sotgia kidnapped by Somali gunmen in the town
of Hagar a week ago, said he is "so far being treated well," and
urged for a quick release.
</P>
<P>
Sotgia told this reporter through the VHF radio in Hagar 165
kilometers northwest of the southern port city of Kismayu this
afternoon that he is " so far being treated well, being fed well
and given enough water in a house. "
</P>
<P>
Sotgia said, with very serious and cautious voice, "I have no
medicine, but I am doing fine."
</P>
<P>
The Italian aid worker asked his organization, Terra Nuova, to
accelerate their efforts in securing his safe release.
</P>
<P>
"I just want my organization to find a solution to this
problem quickly, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Abshir Abdullahi Hassan, head of the Terra Nuova office in
Hagar, is also being kept as a hostage in the same place with his
superior, Dr Stefano Sotgia. Abshir is also being blamed for his
role in spreading false information about the expected activities
of Terra Nuova.
</P>
<P>
Marwas Yareh Hassan, spokesman for the gunmen holding the Terra
Nuova staff members has threatened, on VHF radio contact with this
reporter, that they will take an emergency decision unless
something quick is done in the next 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman has refused to elaborate what kind of
decision they are likely to take. Speculations are that they may
loose patience in the treatment of their captives.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Terms Peace as Right Choice in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
Saturday reiterated that choice of peace is the right way to solve
problems in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech marking Israel's 1982 return of Sinai to
Egypt, Mubarak said that "most certainly, just peace is the right
option, or rather the only one, which all peoples in the region,
including the Israelis, side with."
</P>
<P>
He called on Arabs and Israelis to set aside their differences
and work toward realizing the Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
"The peace march will not be derailed no matter what hurdles it
faces," said Mubarak, calling for a "historic reconciliation"
between the Arabs and the Israelis to end their conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Those who call for war are a minority who have strayed from
the path of peace, and their fate is that they will be forgotten,
no matter how loud their voices are," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel have faltered
repeatedly since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took
office in May 1996. The two sides have argued over numerous
issues, including security for Israel and Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel. The 1979 Camp David accords paved the way for the return
of Sinai to Egypt, which was captured by Israel during the 1967
Arab-Israeli war.

<P>

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:

<HEADLINE> Iranian Minister Facing Impeachment Defies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Despite the impeachment threat
against him, Iran's moderate Minister of Culture and Islamic
Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani vowed to continue his open-minded
policies on press and cultural affairs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here Saturday, Mohajerani said
his ministry's policies would not change, even if he would be
removed by the impeachment motion of conservative Majlis
(parliament).
</P>
<P>
He noted that all the policies in his ministry have been
confirmed by President Mohammad Khatami and he would not change
the policies under impeachment pressures.
</P>
<P>
"We observed no changes in the Interior Ministry after former
Interior Minister (Abdollah Nouri) was impeached by the Majlis
(last June)," said Mohajerani, also spokesman of Khatami's
government.
</P>
<P>
A group of 31 conservative Majlis deputies on Wednesday tabled
a motion against Mohajerani, accusing him of failing to uphold
Islamic and revolutionary values by adopting a liberal policy on
the press, book publishing and the arts.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers also charged him of misappropriating public funds
for minor Hajj rituals.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani immediately announced his readiness to attend the
Majlis session to face an impeachment trial. The Majlis decided to
debate the motion next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani told reporters said that the impeachment has long
been planned. "Some Majlis deputies called for impeachment against
me even one month after I received a vote of confidence from the
Majlis to be the minister of culture and Islamic guidance in
1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister termed the impeachment motion as "a factional
political move" against the moderates. "The impeachment has been
on the table, it only needs some pretexts," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the motion was aimed at a major change in the
ministry and its policy.
</P>
<P>
The minister, a close ally and strong supporter of Khatami,
underlined that the motion against him would fail and he would
succeed in gaining a vote of confidence from the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani is the second minister of Khatami's cabinet
targeted by the powerful conservatives, who still dominate the
country's most important organs, such as the judiciary, the
Majlis and armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Since former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri was sacked by the
Majlis, Mohajerani has come under fire. The conservatives vowed to
elbow the moderates or Khatami's supporters out of the Iranian
political arena.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with local daily Iran News published on
Thursday, Mohajerani said the impeachment motion against him was
politically motivated and would backfire. "Experience has shown
that such moves will backfire and only add to the popularity of
the person put under pressure," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami named Nouri as vice president as after he was impeached
in a move of defiance.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani vowed to continue his political activities "with
better planning" even if the impeachment succeeds in removing him
from office.
</P>
<P>
"I may run as a candidate in the sixth Majlis elections (next
year), I am not the type of person to buckle under pressure and I
will continue to fulfill my political and social duties," he
said.

JAKARTA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Southeast Maluku town
of Tual was still rocked by small scale clashes through Friday
night, chief of regional military command Maj. Gen. Suaidi

<HEADLINE> Donors Pledge to Continue Aid to Bangladesh: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's donors have pledged to
continue assistance to the country's economic development, Finance
Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the donor community discussed with the
Bangladeshi delegation the situation in the country, including
such issues as the opposition's role and hartals, at the two-day
Bangladesh Development Forum in Paris on Monday and Tuesday,
Kibria told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"What the donors desired is development in Bangladesh," he
said, adding that there was no difference between the aims of the
donors and the Bangladeshi government.
</P>
<P>
On donors' aid pledge to Bangladesh, the minister said the
"donors found the country's projection is realistic," shunning a
direct answer whether they had made any definitive commitments of
aid this year.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh was seeking 2.04 billion U.S. dollars from the
donors at the forum, previously known as the Bangladesh Aid Group
Meeting.
</P>
<P>
The donors' aid flow would be more in the next fiscal
(beginning July 1, 1999) than the amount sought at the Paris
meeting if utilization could be increased and on-going financial
reforms accelerated, according to the finance minister.
</P>
<P>
The donors, "not fully happy" over the pace of reforms,
suggested accelerating the reforms, particularly in the banking
and financial sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
At a video press conference on Tuesday, Kibria told reporters
from Paris that he had received "general assurance" from the
donors about continuing the normal flow of assistance. "We have
requested for certain amount of assistance... we have received
general assurance," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, which had earlier said that there would be "no
pledging session" this year, said in a statement that "the
development partners noted that the (Bangladeshi) government has
projected new aid commitments of 2.04 billion dollars for fiscal
year 2000" and "this projection is realistic in the context of
accelerated reforms."

<HEADLINE> Iran Says Religious Group Responsible for Aborted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official said
Saturday that a new Iranian religious group called "Mahdaviyat"
was responsible for the assassination attempt against an Iranian
judicial official in January.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier General Mohammad Ali Jaafari, commander of the ground
forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), said that
the leader and some of the members of the group had been arrested,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Jaafari made the remark after some Iranian newspapers claimed
that the IRGC was behind the failed assassination against head of
Tehran Justice Department Ali Razini, who was wounded in the leg,
abdomen and chest by a bomb attached to his car.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC commander said that a member of the group, who had
served in a bomb defusing squad during the Iran-Iraq war
(1980-88), made the remote-control bomb.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 30-member group had intellectual links with a
clergyman named only as Milani, the grandson of Ayatollah Seyed
Mohammad Hadi Milani, a prominent Iranian religious leader who
died before the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
However, Jaafari said that the group had no connection with
the recent assassination of Brigadier General Ali Sayyad Shirazi,
deputy chief of the Joint Staff of the Iranian armed forces, who
was shot dead in front of his house earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Jaafari said the military had also confiscated 100 guns stolen
by the group.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that no member of the group is associated with any
military or security agency and that one of them had been
officially recruited by IRGC, but was later expelled.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's port of Xiamen
is playing a bigger role in direct shipping between the mainland
and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
 Statistics showed that the port handled 187,374 containers in
the first quarter of this year, up 20.8 percent over the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
 Direct shipments to Taiwan amounted to 74,290 containers, up
62.03 percent over the first quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
 Owing to restrictions imposed by Taiwan, there has been no
direct shipping links between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits
for decades.
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1997, a pilot program for direct shipping was
introduced. By the end of March this year, there had been 2,239
direct shipments between the two sides, involving a total of 345,
000 containers.
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to its proximity to Taiwan, the port has had a bigger
part to play in the new shipping schedules with the island.
</P>
<P>
 Xiamen's direct shipments to Taiwan involved 75.99 percent of
the total shipments of the mainland to Taiwan in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Reaffirms Compliance with OPEC Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has reaffirmed its full
compliance with OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries) production cuts and promised to decrease148,000 barrels
per day (bpd), bringing its daily output to 1,885,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
National Planning Minister Chief Rasheed Gbadamosi said Friday
in capital Abuja that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
has already directed local oil producing firms to cut their daily
output by five to seven percent, the Guardian newspapers reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The production cuts was agreed by OPEC members at its 107th
meeting in Vienna last March, explained the minister who led
Nigeria's delegation to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
As the oil price at international markets rose to 16.50 U.S.
Dollars per barrel on Friday, the Nigerian minister predicted that
it is feasible the price go up to 18-19 Dollars at the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, an OPEC member and the sixth largest oil exporting
country in the world, is expected to reap a windfall from crude
oil sale as the government based this year's budget on the average
price of nine Dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Gbadamosi told reporters that "indeed, the average selling
price has now hit 15 Dollars per barrel and by the end of this
year, the prospects for 18- 19 Dollars look feasible."
</P>
<P>
Given the prospect from the rising crude oil price, he noted,
this year' s budget will have to be re-engineered to reflect the
new development with more proceeds going into deficit financing of
the budget.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out "if we are able to hold our finances
and control deficit, we will be able to get debt rescheduling from
creditors."
</P>
<P>
"Once the macro economic stability remains stable, we will get
core investors and the economy will expand," he added.

<HEADLINE> News analysis: Indian Politicians Face Hard Choices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Indian politicians now face
hard choices concerning government formation following failure of
the largest opposition party, the Congress, to get support of at
least 272 members of parliament out of the total number of 543.
</P>
<P>
The Congress's bid to form a minority government with outside
support of other opposition parties was virtually derailed Friday
when Samajawadi (socialist) Party (SP), which has 20 seats in Lok
Sabha (lower house of parliament), announced its opposition to a
Congress-led government.
</P>
<P>
Another two parties of the opposition camp, Revolutionary
Socialist Party (RSP) and All Indian Forward Block (AIFB), which
together have 7 seats in Lok Sabha, also rejected the idea of a
Congress-led government.
</P>
<P>
Congress leader Sonia Gandhi met President Kocheril Raman
Narayanan Friday, the second time in two days, and handed over a
list of only 233 members of parliament who have pledged support
for her party, 39 short of the least margin of majority in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the president asked her to continue consultations with
other parties and try to form an alternative government, saying he
would not take a "hasty decision" on government formation.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued late Friday night from the presidential
palace said that the president would take into account past
precedents as well as "new circumstances, some of which are
altogether without earlier paradigms in India."
</P>
<P>
The current political crisis arose on Saturday last week when
the coalition government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
was voted down in Lok Sabha.
</P>
<P>
Before and after the fall of the BJP-led government, Sonia
Gandhi insisted on formation of a Congress-led government with
outside support of other parties in the opposition camp and she
had promised two days ago when she met the president to produce a
list of 272 MPs backing her party.
</P>
<P>
With refusal of support by SP, RSP and AIFB, the Congress can
not manage to get the least majority of 272 in parliament and the
choices facing the biggest opposition is either to agree to a
coalition with, possibly, a prime minister from other party, or a
mid-term election which both the BJP and its allies and most
parties in the opposition have tried to avoid.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the BJP has managed to gather support of some 270
MPs and claimed the right of reinstallation of the coalition ever
since its fall a week ago.
</P>
<P>
What has been agreed among the opposition is to prevent the
reinstallation of the BJP government with Atal Behari Vajpayee as
its prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Following the announcement by SP, RSP and AIFB, Congress
leaders indicated that a coalition government could not be ruled
out, but the shape of a future government has not been decided.
</P>
<P>
For smaller opposition parties, each has its own interests to
consider, pulling down the Vajpayee government is one thing,
formatting a new one is another.
</P>
<P>
The ball is now in the court of the president, who has been
reportedly seriously considering various options to install "a
viable and stable government" including the hardest choice of
bring back Vajpayee as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Narayanan, too, would be averse to a mid-term poll, according
to Lok Sabha speaker G. M. C. Galayogi, who met the president
Friday.
</P>
<P>
For several days, Narayanan has been busy meeting various party
and state leaders to solicit their views on government formation.
</P>
<P>
Some who met the president on Friday left with the impression
that Narayanan would prefer to go through the motion of inviting
the so-called third front leaders, who belong to parties with a
number of members of parliament, to form a government after Sonia
Gandhi reported success or failure in her efforts.
</P>
<P>
Another choice for Indian politicians is to kick the ball to
parliament and let it decide the formation of a government or the
fate of the Congress, BJP and others.
</P>
<P>
Any way, what Indians and most of the political parties want to
see is a quick solution to the political crisis and a future
government which is stable and efficient as the unstable political
environment has already brought adverse effects to their daily
life socially and economically.

settlement of the Kosovo crisis, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>

diplomatic solution to settle the crisis and the ethnical
cleansing in Kosovo and expressed hope that his visit to Europe

<HEADLINE> NATO Bombings Hit Three Serbian Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Powerful bombings hit three
Serbian towns of Nis, Novi Sad and Kraljevo early Saturday as NATO
air strikes against Yugoslavia entered the 32nd day.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's official Tanjug news agency reported that NATO
aircraft dropped 26 powerful bombs just after midnight on Nis,
some 220 kilometers south of Belgrade, hitting factories, schools
and residential areas and damaging water and electricity supply
facilities.
</P>
<P>
At 2:45 a.m. local time, NATO bombings smashed a fuel depot and
a section of highway in Kraljevo, 150 kilometers south of Belgrade.
Half an hour later, NATO warplanes launched another attack on the
oil refinery in Novi Sad in northern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
In Belgrade, people experienced a relatively quiet night with
no sounds of flying planes, blasts or anti-aircraft fires, except
for sirens at 10:15 p.m. local time Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several thousand volunteers from Belgrade,
Montenegro, Bosnia, Greece, Macedonia, Ukraine, Russia, Italy and
some Arab countries continued to stand as "human shields" on three
bridges across the Sava and Danube rivers, chanting songs in
protest against NATO's raids on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Reports say that thousands of Belgraders are going to rally at
the central square in the Yugoslav capital at midday Saturday to
mourn for those killed by NATO bombings at the Serbian state radio
and television building early Friday. The Tanjug reported that at
least 10 people were killed and 18 injured in the attack.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (50) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 50 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Will the Government of the Macao Special Administrative Region
protect the scenic spots and historical sites in Macao?
</P>
<P>
The infusion of the Chinese and Western cultures has left many
unique sites of historical interest, scenic spots and other
tourist attractions in Macao, such as the serene and picturesque
Temple of the Goddess A-Ma, the grand and imposing St. Paul's
Facade, the interconnected Puji Peaceful Seclusion for meditation,
the Dong Wang Yang Soughing Lighthouse, the fascinating Luyuan
Garden with winding corridors, and the Dragon Ring Exhibition of
houses of the unique Portuguese Style.
</P>
<P>
They are not only the testimony to the cultural heritage of
Macao, but also famous tourist attractions. Article 125 of the
Basic Law provides that after the return of Macao, the Government
of the Macao Special Administrative Region shall protect by law
scenic spots, historical sites and other historical relics as well
as the lawful rights and interests of the owners of antiques. (

<HEADLINE> Warning to Computer Users Against Virus Posted in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A computer emergency response
team at Carnegie Mellon University on Friday posted a warning to
computer users against a malicious computer virus set to strike
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new virus was called the Chernobyl virus because it is
timed to go off on the anniversary of the Russian nuclear accident,
one of technology's worst disasters.
</P>
<P>
The most common version of the Chernobyl virus, also known as "
CIH", was programmed to activate on computers using Windows 95 and
Windows 98 on Monday, the 13th anniversary of the nuclear disaster
in Ukraine, computer experts said.
</P>
<P>
They added that the Chernobyl virus can erase a computer's hard-
drive and prevent the equipment from restarting.
</P>
<P>
Carey Nachenberg, chief researcher at Symantec's Antivirus
Research Center, said one big risk, that stems from a potential
infection on a company's computer net work, could then spread to
individual computers.
</P>
<P>
"If it gets on a corporate network and the volumes are not
protected, it could spread very, very rapidly," Nachenberg said.
</P>
<P>
The warning could be read on the web site at http://www.cert.
org.

MANILA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Department of
Finance (DOF) vowed to ban the importation of luxury vehicles by
foreign consultants hired by the Philippine government for its
various infrastructure projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo B. Espiritu said Friday that foreign
consultants were found to have abused the privilege accorded to
them by the government by importing luxury cars for their personal
interests.
</P>
<P>
He also said that foreign consultants were allowed to bring in
cars tax-free for their personal use while doing their consultancy
jobs in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
However, the DOF discovered that these consultants had brought
in luxury cars which they later dispose for profits.
</P>
<P>
Under the DOF policy, only service vehicles should be brought
in as part of their convenience during the duration of their stay
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Lifts Ban on Sale of Fish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has lifted
the month-long ban on the sale of fish nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Fisheries Fred Mukisa announced the
decision here Friday that the ban was lifted after verifying that
fish poisoning had substantially reduced in the 10 districts on
the Lake Victoria shores.
</P>
<P>
Local communities, particularly those on Victoria islands, had
been lacking food due to the fish ban, Saturday's New Vision
daily quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
To punish the offenders, local authorities recommended that
anybody caught using poison to catch fish should be imprisoned
according to laws that will be set by local authorities.
</P>
<P>
Mukisa said persons involved in fisheries will have to register
their residences, fishing boats, types of gear and types of fish
they catch. Identity cards are to be issued to this effect.
</P>
<P>
The newly formed fish inspection services are now in place and
committees with powers to set bylaws and to arrest offenders have
been set up, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The fish ban was imposed a month ago following massive fish
poisoning on Lake Victoria, the world's second largest fresh water
lake. Poisoned fish cost at least four lives in the capital area.
The European Union subsequently also banned fish exports from East
Africa. The ban made Uganda lose some one million dollars.

Bellamy, who has just completed her China visit at the
invitation of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC), said that UNICEF is keen to expand mutual
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a Xinhua interview Friday Bellamy said it seemed to her that
the Chinese government has attached importance to the work of
women and children and achieved most of the goals set out in its
children's development program.
</P>
<P>
She referred to the fact that China has been polio free for
several years, and that the iodine deficiency disease has been
reduced dramatically.
</P>
<P>
"China now has a lot of primary infant hospitals which has
helped reduce the death rate of infants," she added.
</P>
<P>
She praised China's achievements in pushing forward compulsory
education, which enables school-aged children to have the
opportunity to study and described China's Hope Project as "
successful".
</P>
<P>
But she also said that the rate of girl school drop-outs is
still high, and trafficking in women and children still happens
now and then because of China's economic disparity and the
remnants of old traditions.

<HEADLINE> Former Lebanese Official Indicted on Embezzlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's former Director-General
of Antiquities Camille Asmar and three associates have been
formally charged with embezzlement, the Daily Star reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
State Prosecutor for Financial Fraud Ahmad Taqieddine Friday
filed charges against Asmar and the other suspects after
investigators discovered that the directorate's 3.3 million
U.S. dollars had gone missing during Asmar's tenure.
</P>
<P>
The missing funds are believed to have been squandered through
the payment of forged and fictitious bills.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some 5 million dollars in foreign grants which
the directorate had received before Asmar was fired by the
Cabinet in January have apparently also gone into private pockets,
the paper quoted judicial sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The suspect's files were referred to Beirut Investigative
Magistrate Raymond Oueidat. If convicted, they could face up to
three years' imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Asmar, who served the department for 36 consecutive years that
included the 1975-1990 civil war, became the second highest
ranking Lebanese official to be indicted on a corruption charge
since President Emile Lahoud took office last November.
</P>
<P>
The president vowed to eradicate rampant corruption and take
back all public funds stolen by officials of former government of
Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
The first to be charged was former Oil Minister Shahe
Barsoumian, who faces an embezzlement charge of 800 million
dollars in shady fuel deals during his three-year tenure that
ended last November.

<HEADLINE> Aid Agencies Pull Out from W. Uganda After Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- International aid agencies have
withdrawn from western Uganda due to increased violence in the
region by Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a major rebel group
having been active there since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Their pulling out did not mean that they would suspend their
activities there. They were waiting to see how the situation
would develop, Saturday' s Monitor daily quoted U.N. World Food
Program (WFP) country representative in Uganda, Michael Jones, as
saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The WFP's move came after ADF rebels entered Bundibugyo town
Monday night and began shooting, killing at least two civilians
and wounding an unknown number of others.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were reportedly targeting the Picfare Hotel in the
town, a popular joint for army commanders in the area.
</P>
<P>
Rebel activities have increased since the start of the year and
at least 80 people have died in raids, including 30 killed last
week in attacks on Bundibugyo and the neighboring Kabarole
district.
</P>
<P>
Aid agencies based in Uganda estimated that between 50,000 and
70,000 people there have been displaced by the rebel violence in
the region alone.
</P>
<P>
The ADF rebels currently operate out of camps in the Rwenzori
Mountains straddling the common border with the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).

<HEADLINE> Manila Urges Traders to Refrain From Exploiting Oil Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada appealed to businessmen Saturday not to exploit the recent
round of oil price hikes by increasing the prices of their
products and services.
</P>
<P>
The president said Saturday morning in his weekly Radio--TV
program that he has ordered all government agencies concerned to
closely monitor the prices of basic commodities.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that businessmen would not take advantage of this oil
price hike by also raising the prices of their goods," he said.
</P>
<P>
Caltex Philippines, Pilipinas Shell and Petron, the three
biggest oil companies of the country, have raised prices of fuel
products this week by an average of 43 centavos (1.075 cents) to
50 centavos (1.25 cents) per liter.
</P>
<P>
Estrada explained that government is not in a position to stop
the recent round of oil price hikes, because the prices of
petroleum products largely depend on the cost of crude oil in the
world market.
</P>
<P>
The oil industry in the Philippines has also become fully
deregulated, with market forces playing the key role in
determining petroleum prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
The only option available to the government, the president
said, is to have the Energy Regulatory Board monitor oil prices
and make sure the price hikes are reasonable.
</P>
<P>
He said the Department of Justice would file appropriate
charges against firms found making unreasonable price increases.
</P>
<P>
The president said he has ordered Secretary Jose Pardo of the
Department of Trade and Industry to keep tabs on business firms as
well.
</P>
<P>
He said he has also ordered Pardo and Secretary Bienvenido
Laguesma of the Department of Labor and Employment to study a new
package of benefits for workers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said the government
is studying ways to prevent inflation and help workers cope with
current living standards.

<HEADLINE> NATO Summit Issues "Washington Declaration" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- NATO leaders signed and issued
"The Washington Declaration" here Friday, reaffirming their
commitment to enhanced collective defense and continued expansion
of membership as the key to achieve "peace and stability" in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
"The world has changed dramatically over the last half century,
but our common values and security interests remain the same,"
said the declaration by the 19 heads of NATO member states who are
attending the current three-day summit beginning here Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
"We are charting NATO's course as we enter the 21st century: an
Alliance committed to collective defense, capable of addressing
current and future risks to our security, strengthened by and open
to new members and working together with other institutions,
Partners and Mediterranean Dialogue countries in a mutually
reinforcing way to enhance Euro-Atlantic security and stability,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that collective defense remains "the core purpose of
NATO," the document stressed the need for "political solidarity"
and strengthened military forces among NATO members so as to meet
the security challenges in the next century.
</P>
<P>
"We pledge to improve our defense capabilities to fulfill the
full range of the Alliance's 21st century missions. We will
continue to build confidence and security through arms control,
disarmament and non-proliferation measures. We reiterate our
condemnation of terrorism and our determination to protect
ourselves against this scourge," it added.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said NATO would keep open to all European
nations, regardless of their geographical locations, so long as
they were willing and able to meet the responsibility of
membership.
</P>
<P>
"NATO is an essential pillar of a wider community of shared
values and shared responsibility," it said.
</P>
<P>
The document also called for the reinforcement of trans-
Atlantic relations in NATO. The destinies of North America and
Europe remain inseparable, it said, adding that "when we act
together, we safeguard our freedom and security and enhance
stability more effectively than any of us could alone."
</P>
<P>
NATO, which has kept pummeling Yugoslavia with air bombs and
cruise missiles in the past month, said in the declaration that it
wants to "live in peace with all nations, and settle any
international dispute by peaceful means." Those high-flight words
have been seen by some media here as "tongue in cheek," showing
nothing but hypocrisy on the part of the Atlantic Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The NATO leaders, who gathered here at the Reagan International
Trade Center Friday afternoon to celebrate the 50th anniversary of
the Alliance, made brief speeches one by one before signing the
declaration.

<HEADLINE> Urban Migration Increasing Fast in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Urban migration in Bangladesh has
been increasing at a faster rate than ever before due to swelling
landlessness and poor avenues of employment in the rural areas, an
English daily newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 1.2 million households are located in the
urban slums comprising 24 percent of the total urban population of
over 25 million in the country, and of the total slum dwellers,
more than 0.6 million families are either squatters or homeless,
the Bangladesh Observer quoted a survey recently conducted by the
Center for Urban Studies (CUS) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The picture of slums in the capital city Dhaka is alarming, and
now there are 3,007 slums in Dhaka with 220,920 slum dwelling
households, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Of these slums in Dhaka, 2,328 are located on private lands
while 679 on government lands, and the density of slum population
in the city is 1,065 person per acre, it stated, adding that the
number of slum dwellers in Dhaka is estimated at around 1.5
million.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of landless households in this South Asian
country increased to 28.3 percent in 1998 from 24.1 percent in
1997, according to the recently published Urban Poverty Monitoring
Survey conducted by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Presently, the number of Bangladesh's completely landless
households is 2.10 million which was only 1.2 million in 1984 in
the rural areas, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
According to a study of the United Nations Development Program,
there will be accelerated migration of rural people to the capital
city from the year 2015 when the city population will stand at
19.5 million surpassing the population of other mega-cities like
New York, Calcutta and Karachi.
</P>
<P>
Fifty percent of the migrants have been coming to Dhaka from
the rural areas as they were rendered completely landless by river
erosion and frequent floods while the rest for new job
opportunities, said Rita Afsar, a researcher at the Bangladesh
Institute of Development Studies.
</P>
<P>
Natural disasters like drought, floods and river bank erosion
have been endangering the existence of people in the rural areas
and forcing the landless people to migrate to the urban areas as
their last means for survival, explained Anu Muhammed, associate
professor of economics of Jahangirnagar University.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Major Millers Close Down as Maize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Most major milling companies in
Zimbabwe were closed Friday because of lack of maize supply.
</P>
<P>
Kumbirayi Katsande, president of the Confederation of Zimbabwe
Industries, confirmed the closures Friday, the daily Herald
reported.
</P>
<P>
"For the past three weeks, supplies of raw maize to milling
companies in the country have been well below the level required
to maintain maize meal products in free supply in the market,"
Katsande said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said the Grain Marketing Board had indicated that supplies
were in transit and production could resume this weekend, provided
the supplies reached the millers soon.
</P>
<P>
He said the industry was concerned that there was confusion in
the country regarding the price at which maize meal products were
being traded.
</P>
<P>
"We want to confirm that there has been no change to the
controlled wholesale and retail maize meal prices that apply in
the market or in the price at which the marketing board is
committed to supplying the industry with maize," he said.
</P>
<P>
The board has increased the price of maize by 63 percent
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There were fears that millers could increase the price of maize
meal or shut down their operations.
</P>
<P>
However, the price was reduced following government
intervention.
</P>
<P>
Because of the controlled price situation, the Grain Marketing
Board was expected to remain the only supplier of raw maize to the
millers who were in no position to buy maize for the production of
maize meal from other sources at higher prices, Katsande said.

Godana pointed out the practice that a group of countries

against a sovereign country "is very frightening to a small

</P>
<P>
"It is Yugoslavia today, and could be any other country
tomorrow," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He added that any forcibly menace or any military action by a

"We are in an international organization -- the United Nations

"Since NATO was founded as a collective defensive alliance and
there was no aggression from Yugoslavia, it is not justified for
the NATO to launch military actions against Yugoslavia," Godana

<HEADLINE> UN Willing to Resume Humanitarian Aid to Angolan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Humanitarian
Assistance Coordination (UNHAC) said here Friday that it is
willing to resume humanitarian assistance to the Angolan refugees
as long as the Angolan government can provide necessary security.
</P>
<P>
Francesco Stripolli, coordinator of the UNHAC, said this as he
was meeting with Angolan Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Toko
Serao.
</P>
<P>
Stripolli noted that "it is very necessary to add emergency
humanitarian assistance to the provinces of Malanje, Bie and
Huambo." But he pointed out that security is not guaranteed
there.
</P>
<P>
Because the routes leading to these provinces have been cut off
by the rebel troops of the National Union for the Independence of
Angola (UNITA) and most of the airports are within the range of
the UNITA fire, the UNHAC was forced to suspend its relief flights
to the Angolan refugees.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official said that the humanitarian assistance would
be resumed at any time as long as the Angolan government can
guarantee security of the relief actions.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics released by the World Food
Program, the total number of the Angolan refugees has amounted to
1.7 million and the humanitarian situation in the southern African
country is "serious".
</P>
<P>
Local government officials in Angola said recently that the
150,000 refugees besieged in central town of Kuito, capital of Bie
Province, are living in dire conditions and some of them are dying
from hunger or diseases.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Police Brutality Sparks Controversy in S.Africa  (By Shang Xuqian) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A BBC documentary on
incidents of South African police brutality has caused controversy
across the country.
</P>
<P>
The documentary, aired by the BBC on Monday night, showed
police officers punching, kicking, rifle-butting and setting dogs
on arrested suspects. Part of the documentary was screened by
South African television stations on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
While the violence was officially condemned and six officers
involved were suspended, ordinary citizens tend to look at the
other side of the story.
</P>
<P>
Riaan Smit was the original victim of one of the car hijacking
incidents filmed by the BBC.
</P>
<P>
Smit was hijacked on January 24 in downtown Johannesburg. He
was approached by an armed man when he stopped his car that night
to make a U- turn.
</P>
<P>
"I got out of the car, and he swore at me and told me not to
move. So I did what he said. He stood in front of me, aimed the
gun at my head and squeezed the trigger.
</P>
<P>
"Then he looked at the gun in surprise when it jammed, shook it
a bit, pointed it into my face and pulled the trigger again, and
still nothing happened," Smit recalled with horror.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker was then joined by an accomplice and fled with
Smit's white BMW. Smit phoned the anti-hijacking flying squad and
within 30 minutes his car was spotted.
</P>
<P>
In a car chase, the stolen car crashed. The BBC footage showed
police officers punching one unconscious hijacker, who was trapped
behind the steering wheel, and hitting another with rifle butt as
he lay next to the stolen car. A gun was found inside the car.
</P>
<P>
One of the suspects died in hospital. However, it is unknown
whether he died of the crash or the assault.
</P>
<P>
"Where was the camera when the guy pointed a gun in my face and
squeezed the trigger?" Smit asked.
</P>
<P>
"I am not saying that what the police did was right, but they
acted so quickly when they spotted my car, and after the arrest
they took my cellphone, ID book and personal items, and had them
returned to me. How bad can they be?"
</P>
<P>
Smit's attitude was not alone in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Citizen newspaper Thursday carried an article by its
well-known writer Brian Stuart, asking the frequently asked
question: why criminals' human rights are better protected than
those of law-abiding citizens?
</P>
<P>
Stuart could not hide his anger at the current criminal justice
system. He asked: "Why is an injured criminal treated in hospital
at state expense, but not the person he injured? Why is a rapist
entitled to legal defense, but not his victim?
</P>
<P>
"Why is he able to lay a charge of assault against any person
who dares defend themselves against him. Why is he not required to
recompense the person for the damage done?"
</P>
<P>
"All the privileges and safeguards are those accorded to the
violators of our human rights," he commented.
</P>
<P>
Most readers' letters carried by newspapers reflect the idea
that police brutality should not be condoned but certain acts are
understandable under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, the overwhelming majority of phone
calls to TV and radio stations showed sympathy with the police,
whom they believe work under extremely high level of stress.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a total of 223 policemen were killed while on duty
and more than 1,000 officers lost their lives since 1994.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has the world's highest rape rate and its murder
rate is only next to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, there is, on average, one
murder or attempted murder every 12 minutes and a rape every 26
seconds.
</P>
<P>
As pictures of the BBC footage could be easily compared to
scenes of apartheid-era police brutality, the authorities were
quick to condemn the incidents.
</P>
<P>
National Police Commissioner George Fivaz described the
incidents as " unacceptable and contrary to departmental
directives, our prevention of torture policy and our code of
conduct".
</P>
<P>
Gauteng provincial police commissioner, Sharma Maharaj, said
the scenes were "despicable acts of lawlessness, making a mockery
of our police service".
</P>
<P>
The officers involved have been suspended, the elite Brixton
anti- hijacking flying squad has been disbanded. An investigation
into the incidents has been launched.
</P>
<P>
However, as experts has pointed out, the problem lies with this
country' s criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
"To suspend six policemen is a simplistic solution. You need to
tackle the root cause of the problem, which lies in the criminal
justice system.
</P>
<P>
"Look at the impact of trauma and multiple exposure to so much
violence and crime, combined with the daily threat to life, and
balance that with the resulting behavior," said Mary Robertson, a
psychologist at the trauma clinic of the Center for the Study of
Violence and Reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Researcher at the center, David Bruce, said: "The police live
in a world of their own and daily come face-to-face with crime in
all its brutality, viciousness and violence. And they lack
confidence in the justice system and feel there is a lack of
seriousness from the government when it comes to tackling crime."
</P>
<P>
"The guys are left feeling that 'if we don't do something about
the problem, no one else will'."
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress government has refused to restore
the death penalty despite the fact that the majority of South
Africans favor the return of capital punishment. Nor it agrees to
hold a referendum on the issue.
</P>
<P>
It argues that such a move is against the constitution, which
states that everyone has the right to life, and that the death
penalty is not a deterrent to crime.
</P>
<P>
The death penalty was abolished shortly before the first
democratic elections in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Explodes Near British, U.S. Consulates in Central Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A home-made explosive device
blasted in the small hours Saturday near a building housing the
British and U.S. consulates in downtown Ekaterinburg in Russia's
central Urals region, ITAR-TASS reported.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, occurring at a parking lot, blew out windows in
the surrounding buildings but caused no casualties, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Security agents soon arrived at the scene to investigate the
incident, seen by many as a retaliation to NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The explosion is the second of its kind after a gun-shooting
attack at the U.S. embassy in central Moscow on March 28.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (49) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) - Following is part 49 of a question
and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Will the Macao Special Administrative Region introduce a
compulsory education system?
</P>
<P>
Compulsory education is an important criterion in determining
the level of educational development of a country or a region.
</P>
<P>
According to the provisions of the General Law of the
Educational System of Macao promulgated in 1991, the Portuguese
Macao Government should provide free education for children at the
government-run and privately sponsored pre-school centers, primary
and junior middle schools.
</P>
<P>
They are exempt from tuition fees or any other fees related to
enrollment, education or certificates. Pupils from the non-
sponsored private schools are entitled to subsidies for tuition
fees.
</P>
<P>
The details of the free education system were to be provided
for by a separate law. However, owing to various reasons, the
Governor of Macao did not issue an act on free education until
1995.
</P>
<P>
That free education act provides that pupils of the seven
grades from the pre-school class to grade 6 class of the primary
schools shall enjoy free education starting from the 1995-1996
school year, provided that they are from the government-funded
schools or non-profit-seeking private schools.
</P>
<P>
But compulsory education is different from free education. In
addition to offering education free, it stresses the right of
every school-age child to receive education and the obligation of
the government and parents to create conditions for children to
receive education. Apparently, compulsory education is not yet
practiced in Macao.
</P>
<P>
In the course of drafting the Basic Law, the drafting
committee gave careful consideration to the demand of the Macao
residents for replacing free education with compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that without adequate financial resources, it
will be difficult to introduce compulsory education. It is
therefore stipulated in Article 121 of the Basic Law that the
Government of the Macao Special Administrative Region shall, in
accordance with law, gradually institute a compulsory educational
system.
</P>
<P>
This provision places both the Government of the Macao Special
Administrative Region under a legal obligation to pursue
compulsory education and to take into account the interests of all
sections of society.
</P>
<P>
It makes it possible for compulsory education to gradually
develop and improve in Macao under rule of law.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Parliament: Uphold Non-alignment Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian parliament on Thursday
strongly criticized NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia and urged
the authorities to uphold the position of non-alignment.
</P>
<P>
NATO's attempt to expand its military action to territories
outside its members without authorization from the U.N. Security
Council was "very dangerous," added the parliament in a resolution
passed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The parliament urged the president to strengthen his mediation
efforts over the Balkan conflict and the U.N. to hold an
international peace and security meeting on the issue in the city
of Kiev.
</P>
<P>
It also asked all parliamentary councils and government
departments to stick to the non-alignment policy and firmly
safeguard national interests under the constitution. Ukraine could
cooperate with global and regional security systems, but not join
any military and political alliance, it said.
</P>
<P>
Since NATO's actions were "aggressive in nature," it demanded,
Ukraine's relations with NATO should be re-examined.
</P>
<P>
Regarding European integrity as its strategic diplomatic target,
Ukraine has expanded cooperation with NATO since they forged a
special partnership in 1996. But their relationship was impaired
lately by NATO's savage bombing against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> South Asia Film Festival to be Held in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Film Festival, the first of its kind,
will be held in Sri Lanka in September this year to boost
interaction within the region.
</P>
<P>
The two-week festival, based on a concept of Sri Lankan
President Chandrika Kumaratunga, will be held in Colombo and will
screen films produced after January 1, 1996 from all the SAARC
nations, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They said these films with English subtitles will not be
screened on a competitive basis and will provide a much needed
boost to films in countries such as Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan
and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
However, there is strong possibility that these films will be
held on a competitive basis in the years to come in the lines of
the Khan Film Festival in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The festival will screen both feature films and documentaries
as well as short films. It will carry on annually in other SAARC
capitals.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga has directed the Ministry of Posts,
Telecommunications and the Media to coordinate the preliminary
arrangements with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the SAARC
Secretariat and the Colombo-based Asian Film Center.
</P>
<P>
A high powered eight-member committee headed by Secretary to
the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and the Media K.C.
Logeswaran, has been appointed to coordinate the arrangements
leading to the festival.

WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World
Bank will take actions to strengthen the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative, a senior IMF official said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tony Boote, in charge of the initiative at the IMF, said the
debt relief program for the world's most debt-ridden countries has
failed to live up to expectations and needs much work.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC Initiative, launched in the fall of 1996, represented
a major departure from past practice in dealing with debt problems
of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
It focused on achieving overall external debt-sustainability
with comprehensive participation by all external creditors for the
most heavily indebted countries with good track record.
</P>
<P>
The program initially promised debt relief to 23 countries,
with proposals to broaden it to 41 countries with total debt of $
200 billion. (US-IMF-HIPC)

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Reaffirms Rejection to Deployment of Foreign Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivorad
Jovanovic on Friday reiterated the opposition to the deployment of
international forces in Kosovo, according to the Itar-Tass news
agency.
</P>
<P>
Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin and Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic did not talk about the issue of "international
military presence" in Kosovo during their meeting on Wednesday, a
senior Yugoslav diplomat, on behalf of Jovanovic, told the
Belgrade bureau of Itar-Tass. They just discussed the possibility
of sending civil staff to Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat also expressed his dissatisfaction over some media
reports saying that "Yugoslavia has agreed to the deployment of
'international presence' under the U.N. flag and with the
participation of Russia."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin flew to Belgrade Thursday for talks with Milosevic
on seeking a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis. According to
Itar-Tass, the envoy unveiled Thursday night before departure that
Russia and Yugoslavia were preparing to sign a joint document on
the idea of accepting "international presence" in Kosovo. The
details on the nature and makeup of the international presence
needed further discussion, Chernomyrdin was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Chernomyrdin reaffirmed Yugoslavia's concession of
allowing the deployment of foreign "military troops" in Kosovo but
meanwhile stressed the formation of those troops "should be agreed
by Yugoslavia," reported the Itar-Tass.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Washington, where NATO summit is
being held to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the alliance, U.S.
president Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair on
the same day rejected the reported concession of Milosevic as
insufficient and claimed to continue military attacks against his
country.

<HEADLINE> Al-Qathafi's Son Meets Philippines' MILF Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A son of Libyan leader Omar
Al-Qathafi met Friday with Philippines' Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) leader Hashim Salamat in a jungle camp of the MILF in
an effort to jump-start peace talks between the rebel organization
and the Philippine government, the Philippine Star reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, Saif al-Islam al-Qathafi was
accompanied by the Libyan ambassador and two close aides of
Philippine President Joseph Estrada during the visit to a main
training base of the MILF outside the southern city of Cotabato.
</P>
<P>
"Qathafi asked Salamat to hasten the peace talks with Manila,"
MILF spokesman Mohacquer Iqbal was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"On our side, there is no problem because we are sincere.
There's a saying that it takes two to tango so we need sincerity
on the part of the government," he added.
</P>
<P>
The younger Qathafi stayed in the MILF's camp for about three
hours and attended weekly prayers.
</P>
<P>
Another MILF spokesman, Shariff Julabbi, said committee-level
talks to set the agenda for formal peace negotiations were now to
be held on May 8-9 in Cotabato instead of the last week in April.
</P>
<P>
It will be the final meeting of the technical committees from
both sides. Formal peace negotiations to seek a political solution
to the 21-year-old hostilities between MILF and the government are
set to open later in May, Julabbi said.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-strong MILF was left out in a peace treaty that
Manila signed with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in
1996, which ended that group's 24-year armed struggle for an
independent Muslim state in the main southern island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Libya and the Organization of the Islamic Conference played key
roles in the successful peace negotiations between the Philippine
government and the MNLF.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Album On Work Of American Agronomist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- An album of the life of William
Hinton, an American agronomist who worked in China, has just been
released by a Hong Kong publisher.
</P>
<P>
"Hinton: An Old Friend of the Chinese People" has seven
chapters and more than 200 photos of Hinton's life and work in
China. It was compiled by the Communist Party Committee of the
city of Changzhi in Shanxi Province where Hinton spent a year in
1948 with a group of university teachers studying land reforms in
a local village.
</P>
<P>
Hinton was born in Chicago in 1919 and came to China as a
volunteer in 1947 to train China's first group of people using
farm machinery. He later went to teach English at Northern
University in the southeastern part of Shanxi Province. He
returned to the U.S. in 1953.
</P>
<P>
In 1966, Hinton, who is best known in China by the name "Han
Ding", began writing books based on his experiences to explain
China's revolution and development to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Hinton will turn 80 this year. He had met Chinese leaders of
the past like Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping, who spoke
highly of his outstanding contributions to Sino-U.S. friendship.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
government "will not close the door to dialogues" with the
National Liberation Army (ELN) which still holds hostages taken in
an air hijack, Colombia's High Commissioner for Peace Victor
Ricardo said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo said this is not the time to aggravate the disputes
between the government and the ELN.
</P>
<P>
He said if the ELN releases all the hostages, the government
will keep the proposals it made in the negotiations in February.

Earlier this month the ELN hijacked a commercial passenger
plane, forcing it to land in a swamp-and-jungle region with all
passengers aboard taken hostage. Thirty-two people are estimated
to be kept in custody.

The government and the ELN representatives held two rounds of
talks on February 5 and 15 about the conditions to be offered by
the government for a national meeting.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Works out New Policies for Industrial Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government is making
efforts to help its industrial zones (IZs) succeed by working out
new policies on domestic and overseas investment in the zone.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's 63 IZs need 20-25 billion U.S. dollars to widen their
operations, but the Vietnamese authorities feel that this is
beyond the country's economic capabilities. They therefore hope to
reap 70-80 percent of this sum from foreign direct investment,
according to a report of Vietnam's English newspaper Vietnam News
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government has focused on adjusting policies in
response to investors' complaints about the investment environment
and overly complicated procedures, the paper quoted an official of
the Vietnam Industrial Zone Management board as saying.
</P>
<P>
In addition, local authorities have adjusted some regulations
to make the IZs more attractive, especially by reducing taxes on
rented land. IZs in Hai Phong, Hanoi and Binh Duong Province are
among those that have cut such taxes by 40-50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Businesses in the IZs have also received extensions on their
State turnover tax payments to boost production and ease problems
of investment forms and cash flow.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, IZ-based businesses have had their import tax on
accessories and technological equipment waived or reduced.
</P>
<P>
The IZs have also been allowed access to the domestic market
and simplified customs procedures.
</P>
<P>
The government, relevant ministries and bodies, local
authorities and investors must coordinate their efforts to help
IZs succeed, the paper added.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan oil basket prices
increased this week by 0.98 dollars to 14.07 per barrel, the
Energy and Mines Ministry announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the rise to NATO's bombing in
Yugoslavia, a cut in world production caused by operational
problems in the North Sea and the explosion of a gas pipeline in
Venezuela's Monagas state.
</P>
<P>
Problems in the U.S. refineries were another factor for the
price rise.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan oil basket average price was 10.57 dollars per
barrel at the close of 1998, far below the 16.32 dollars average
registered in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The average price has had a noticeable recovery so far this
month to 13.35 dollars per barrel, against 8.43 dollars registered
February.
</P>
<P>
The oil basket price dropped 5.75 dollars per barrel in 1998,
causing a reduction of 43.5 percent (six billion dollars) in the
government income.

PANAMA CITY, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian Foreign Minister
Jorge Eduardo Ritter said on Friday that Panama and Colombia
agreed to reinforce surveillance along their shared borders.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came amid press reports that armed
confrontations have occurred in the border area between the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas, the
Colombian Army and paramilitary forces.
</P>
<P>
Panama could hardly agree on the creation of a joint military
force, because it has no army since the old Defense Force was
dismantled in 1989.
</P>
<P>
"So far we do not intend, nor will (we) intend to establish
joint forces," Ritter said after the closing of the Ninth Meeting
of the Colombia-Panama Neighborhood Commission.
</P>
<P>
Another agreement reached at the meeting is concerning the
establishment of a mechanism to handle emergency situations in the
border area.
</P>
<P>
"We need the good will of the two countries to solve the
problems that could emerge at the border," said Colombian Foreign
Minister Guillermo Fernandez de Soto, who also attended the

MANILA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has ordered the labor and trade and industry departments
to study the possibility of implementing wage increases in view of

</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the president as saying that the concerned
cabinet members were already studying the effect of oil price
increases in the citizenry especially those who belong to the
low-income bracket.
</P>
<P>
He said he has ordered the Energy Regulatory Board and the

petroleum products to ensure that oil firms do not "abuse their
right to unilaterally raise their prices."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the militant labor federation Kilusang Mayo Uno said
it would petition for a nationally-legislated 100 pesos (about 2.5
U.S. dollars) increase in the minimum wage, calling it a "just and
urgent demand" for the continued survival of workers' families.

biggest oil companies of the country, have raised prices of fuel
products this week by an average of 43 centavos (1.075 U.S. cents)

</P>
<P>
The oil firms said they raised the prices only after the

<HEADLINE> Situation Back Under Control in Tual, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian security agencies have
regained control over the situation in Tual, capital of southeast
Maluku district, after a fresh riot erupted in the region on
Friday, according to reports reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Slamet Basuki, commander of the Southeast Maluku
military district, said the unrest in Tual claimed three lives and
injured several others.
</P>
<P>
However, some reports put the death toll to at least seven.
</P>
<P>
Although tension in the region had subsided, security forces
were still closely guarding certain locations in Tual to prevent
another incident from happening.
</P>
<P>
"I have given orders to my sub-ordinates to shoot on sight
anyone trying to cross forbidden lines," Basuki added.
</P>
<P>
The riot was the latest outburst of religious unrest in Maluku
province, where more than 300 people have died this year. Dozens
of churches and mosques have been burned.
</P>
<P>
Maluku was known during the Dutch colonial period as the Spice
Islands. Tual is 2,800 kilometers east of Jakarta. Most of
Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims, but Maluku province
has a large Christian population.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Coordinating Minister for Political and Security
Affairs Feisal Tanjung Friday said that Maluku will also be
divided into two provinces, together with the division of Irian
Jaya into three provinces.
</P>

BRAZZAVILLE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- African soccer clubs can cash
in big money from their Clubs Champions competitions while the
other two soccer tournaments have only modest bonuses at stake.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued by the African Football Federation,
the African clubs can receive 6 million African francs (some 10,
000 US dollars) from every win, 3.5 million francs (some 6,000
dollars) from every draw and 600,000 francs (1,000 dollars) from a
single goal in the Champions tournament.
</P>
<P>
All the bonus were provided by the African Football Federation.

However, the Cup Winners' Cup and the Cup of the Confederation
of the African Football, were in short of the cash and the African
clubs can seldom balance their accounts in the competitions, the

Last year, Mimosas of Abidjan won the Clubs Championship for a

<HEADLINE> NATO to Provide Bulgaria With Security: Solana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- NATO will respond to possible
challenge coming from Yugoslavia to Bulgaria's security, which may
be triggered by its use of Bulgarian airspace.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by NATO Secretary General Javier Solana quoted
by the government Information Service Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter conveyed to Prime Minister Ivan Kostov by Deputy
Foreign Minister Konstantin Dimitrov, who negotiated on NATO's use
of Bulgarian sky, Solana said this is a follow-up of the position
voiced in his letter to Bulgarian President Peter Stoyanov on
April 20.
</P>
<P>
He said the security of NATO members is closely connected with
that of all partner-countries in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Since the security of the partner-countries is an immediate and
major concern of NATO, a threat by Yugoslavia to Bulgaria's
territorial integrity, political independence and security would
be unacceptable, he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government Closes Two More Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government Friday
closed down two joint-venture banks and took over Bank Niaga in
its final round of restructuring measures for the ailing banking
industry.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia Governor Sjahril Sabirin said that joint-venture
Bank Indovest and Bank LTCB Central Asia would be closed down
because their owners failed to recapitalize the banks by the April
21 deadline.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's bank recapitalization program, designed to
lift banks capital adequacy ratio (CAR) to the minimum 4 percent
level, joint-venture banks are not entitled to any government
funding facility, unlike domestic private banks which receive up
to 80 percent of their recapitalization funding requirement from
the government.
</P>
<P>
CAR is the ratio between equity capital and risk-weighted
assets.
</P>
<P>
On March 13, the government undertook some major measures to
improve the monetary system by closing down 38 banks, taking over
seven others and to recapitalize nine private banks.
</P>
<P>
The nine private banks joining the government recapitalization
program have to provide their 20 percent recapitalization funding
portion in cash, but joint-venture banks have to provide the full
recapitalization funding without government help.
</P>
<P>
Based on the 1998 due diligence audit, out of 32 joint-venture
banks in the country, 15 banks posted a CAR level equal or more
than 4 percent, and 17 banks had a CAR level below 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Only Bank Indovest and Bank LTCB had failed to meet the
recapitalization requirements, Sabirin was quoted by national
newspapers Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Publicly listed Bank Indovest is a joint-venture between
state-owned Bank Dagang Negara (51 percent), Japan's Bank of Tokyo
Mitsubishi (18.14 percent), Nikko Merchant Bank (17.43 percent)
and the public (13.43 percent).
</P>
<P>
Bank LTCB is a joint-venture between Japanese Long Term Credit
Bank (75 percent) and Bank Central Asia (25 percent).
</P>
<P>
Sabirin said the government decided to take over Bank Niaga,
which had originally qualified for the government-sponsored
recapitalization program, because the owners had declined to
provide the 20 percent funding requirement by the April 21
deadline.
</P>
<P>
He said several foreign investors were still in the negotiation
process with Bank Niaga shareholders to provide the 20 percent
recapitalization funding requirement.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin said except for Bank Niaga, all eight private banks had
deposited their recapitalization funding requirement.

<HEADLINE> Russia Accuses NATO of Human Rights Violations in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia has lodged a protest with
NATO countries over human rights violations committed by NATO
forces in Yugoslavia, a Russian foreign ministry statement said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said NATO's bombing against Yugoslavia was a
blatant violation of universally recognized norms and laws
governing international affairs, adding that Russia considered
NATO's act as an aggression in which NATO must be held responsible
for all consequences arising therefrom.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that it was NATO's military actions that caused
such a huge wave of refugees and tension in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
NATO's call to overthrow the legitimately-elected leader of
Yugoslavia and intensify its military actions was even more
worrisome, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
It urged NATO to make an assessment of civilian casualties and
economic losses caused by the military actions in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
It also said Russia hoped to know when and with what measures
NATO is going to stop or correct its act of human rights
violations and how it is going to compensate for the economic
losses to Yugoslavia and its people.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva
rejected a Russia-backed motion calling for an immediate end to
hostilities and human rights violations throughout Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> First Badminton Simulation Held in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- In the first simulation held here
Friday night, Indonesian women's shuttler Mia Audina proved she
was still in form, despite controversy surrounding her marriage to
Surinamese Tylio Lobman, the Jakarta Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ranked eighth in the world, Mia defeated Lidya Djaelawidjaja 13-
12, 9-11, 11-9 in a close match in about 80 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Mia, who skipped training for about three weeks after her
wedding ceremony in the Netherlands, relied on her high technical
skills and experience after her left thigh was injured in the
third set.
</P>
<P>
"It was an old injury, but I forced myself to win. I will force
myself harder in the Sudirman Cup if I still am injured. It really
hurt," she said.
</P>
<P>
Coach Liang Chiusia said Mia had performed better than expected.
</P>
<P>
"She only trained for a week but she still won. She was too
slow and her footwork was really awful. However, she's still the
best. We have two weeks to improve her physical condition. I'm
optimistic she will reach her (optimum) standard.
</P>
<P>
"If she can't reach it, then we must expel her from the team,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Lidya, ranked 12th in the world, said she was unable to
withhold the pressure in the decider.
</P>
<P>
"She took control in the third set and I started to be doubtful.
I was afraid to make mistakes but finally I did", she said.
</P>
<P>
Badminton Association of Indonesia training center director
Christian Hadinata was critical of Lidya's game, saying she failed
to take advantage of Mia's weakened condition.
</P>
<P>
"With one leg injured, Mia could still win the match. It means
she's the best we have," he said.
</P>
<P>
In another women's singles match, Cindana beat Ellen Angelina,
who holds the 20th spot in the world rankings, 11-7, 11-7. Cindana
will most likely meet Mia in the second simulation match here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the men's singles, Taufik Hidayat, ranked 12th in the world,
defeated world number 9 Hendrawan 15-10, 15-12. World number three
Budi Santoso crushed Hariyanto Arbi 15-10, 15-10.
</P>
<P>
In the men's doubles, Tony Gunawan and Candra Wijaya beat Denny
Kantono and Antonius 15-6, 15-10 while Olympic champion Ricky
Subagja and Rexy Mainaki lost to Flandy Limpele and Eng Hian 15-8,
8-15,12-15.
</P>
<P>
Women's pair Indarti Issoliana and Carmelita lost to men's duo
Tri Cahyo and Yan Peter 12-15, 4-15 while mixed doubles Bambang
Suprianto and Minarti Timur beat Tri Kushayanto and Zelin Resiana
15-10, 15-1.

<HEADLINE> Central Intelligence Unit Set up in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Customs Department
has set up a Central Intelligence Unit (CIU) to nab local and
international racketeers who use the country as a safe haven and a
transit hub for smuggling, the official Daily news reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The CIU introduced a 24-hour public information hot-line to
receive information and two customs officers are in charge of the
hot-line to transmit intelligence immediately to the relevant
sections.
</P>
<P>
The CIU has formed intelligence networks with foreign customs
in order to strengthen detection of international smuggling
through the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the informants were rather hesitant because a proper
channel to reach the correct person in time was not available and
they had to contact a friend or someone to prove the authenticity
of the information, customs officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, in the new unit there will be a round-the-clock
answering service and a team on call to pursue the "leads".
</P>
<P>
The CIU also plans to recruit informants on a permanent basis
to assist in the detection, the officials told the paper Friday.
</P>
<P>
About 40 percent of the annual detection by the Sri Lankan
Customs are made on public information in Sri Lanka.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The oceanic disasters last year
caused more than two billion yuan (about 241 million U.S. dollars)
of losses in China's coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
These disasters were mainly typhoons, tidal waves, ice and red
tides, said Wang Fei, director of the environmental protection
department under the State Oceanic Administration.
</P>
<P>
Seven big typhoons occurred along the coast over the past year,
three of which caused huge damages and about one billion yuan of
direct economic losses.
</P>
<P>
About 22 red tides appeared in 1998, affecting not only the
coastal sea areas but also some outer seas.
</P>
<P>
The duration of the red tides last year was much longer than
ever before, Wang said. The biggest red tide ever recorded in the
Bohai Sea took place last fall, lasting over 40 days and affecting
an area of 5,000 square kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Romania Suffers Economic Losses by NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 23 (Xinhua) -- NATO's month-long bombing of
Yugoslavia has caused a loss of 700.3 million U.S. dollars to the
Romanian economy, Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile announced on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
 He said his government has handed over a report on the loss
situation to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The news media here quoted the IMF as saying that the Romanian
gross domestic product of this year may drop two percentage points
due to the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
Experts of the World Economic Institute in Bucharest believe
that the Kosovo crisis will inflict both short-term and long-term
losses on Romanian economy.
</P>
<P>
As for short-term losses, they noted that the cooperation
between Romania and Yugoslavia that was resumed following an end
to the sanctions against Yugoslavia not long ago will have to be
stopped. The suspension of traffic on the Danube River raised the
costs of Romanian exports to western Europe, therefore forcing
many of its products to quit this profitable market.
</P>
<P>
The long-term impact is even worse, they said. International
investors will lose confidence and sense of security in the
turbulent Balkan region, which therefore may dampen Romanian
efforts to reinvigorate its economy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that during international sanctions against
Yugoslavia from 1992 to 1995, Romania suffered a total loss of 30
billion dollars, including over seven billion dollars of immediate
losses.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The increasing frequency of
blue skies and white clouds in Guangzhou, the bustling capital of
south China's Guangdong Province, has resulted in fewer complaints
about urban pollution.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the municipal environment monitoring
center show that the air quality was good or equal to second-
degree national standards for 14 weeks last year.
</P>
<P>
The improving air quality has been attributed to the city
government's incessant efforts to curb urban pollution. Guangzhou
was one of the first group of Chinese cities to introduce weekly
air quality reports. The city also banned the use of leaded
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou is working diligently to become a model Chinese city
using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and environmentally-friendly
fuel. The city has allocated two million yuan to construct two LPG
fueling stations and replace old shuttle buses with new units
equipped for LPG.
</P>
<P>
A number of industrial pollutant indices, including sulfur
dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide, has dropped owing to
the fact that 93 percent of industrial plants have either improved
waste gas treatment facilities or otherwise moved out of the urban
area.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The doping hearing against woman
sprinter Susanthika Jayasinghe of Sri Lanka has been adjourned
until July, the track and field's world governing body IAAF said
in Monte Carlo, Monaco on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe, 24, was tested positive for the steroid nandrolone
in a random doping test in last April, and would face a two-year
ban.
</P>
<P>
IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said Jayasinghe, flanked by a
large Sri Lankan contingent, appeared in the hearing on Thursday,
presented new evidence that forced the three-member doping panel
to adjourn the case to a date in July.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe, who won a silver medal in the 200 meters at the
1997 world championships in Athens, left Sri Lanka for training in
the United States after the Asian Games in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
However, Jayasinghe, even if being found guilty and banned for
two years, could still compete at the Sydney 2000 Olympics as the
bans are usually considered to take effect from the date that the
athlete was caught.
</P>
<P>
Reineri said Jayasinghe was entitled to keep competing because
she was cleared by her federation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China is to provide a vast stable
market for foreign investment in the infrastructure construction
sector, according to Song Mi, a senior official with the State
Development Planning Commission (SDPC).
</P>
<P>
Song, who is in charge of the development of basic industries,
said that more importance will be attached to the energy and
transportation sectors this year and that more foreign investment
is welcome.
</P>
<P>
"Existing foreign investment agreements and contracts will be
honored until they expire," Song said, adding that any
infringements will be severely punished.
</P>
<P>
"However, preferential policies aimed at promoting
infrastructure construction may vary according to the actual
market conditions," she said.
</P>
<P>
Song also gave a list of key industries which will undergo a
structural readjustment, including power generation, coal,
petroleum and natural gas, liquefied natural gas, railways and
highways.
</P>
<P>
China has stepped up input in infrastructure construction last
year in an effort to stimulate domestic demand. Investment in the
coal, electricity, petroleum, communications and
telecommunications sectors totaled 878 billion yuan (about 106
billion U.S.dollars), surging 29 percent year on year.

WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon said on Friday it
would deploy more than 2,000 extra troops to the Balkans and more
equipment to strengthen the air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon spokesman told reporters that the troops will come
from U.S. bases in Europe and the United States to augment the
Apache strike helicopters joining the NATO force.
</P>

The Apache helicopters arrived in Tirana, the capital of
Albania, earlier this week and have not been used in any combat
operation.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon also said that the troops will help protect the
Apaches while they are on the ground, but will not accompany the
Apaches on missions inside Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- In a major effort to accelerate
the application of laboratory results to agriculture, the Chinese
government has kicked off a new project called "Crossing Program"
backed with an annual funding of 50 million yuan (six million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The project was launched by the ministries of agriculture and
finance to meet farmers urgent needs for new technology to help
them boost production and income, today's "China Daily" says.
</P>
<P>
Chinese farmers have been complaining that while agro-science
and research achievements are reported in the media, they remain
either in laboratories or small pilot farms - beyond the reach of
those working in the fields.
</P>
<P>
Now this "Crossing Program" is designed to bring these new
technologies to the farms as soon as possible, ministry officials
said.
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture production has benefited more and more from
science in past few years, but the country has yet to speed up
conversion of research into productivity, and improve science's
contribution to agricultural output," Vice-Minister of Agriculture
Lu Ming was quoted by the paper as saying yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the channel for the implementation of agro-science
and new technologies is somewhat "obstructed", the vice-minister
said at a ceremony in Beijing launching the "Crossing Program".
</P>
<P>
The "Crossing Program" makes sure that the country's "Bumper
Harvest Plan" will have sufficient practical and advanced
technological tools to apply, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, the new program will contribute to the
sustainable development of agriculture in a country that is
striving to ensure security of food supply. It also pursues the
strategy of "revitalizing the nation through science and education,
" he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Badminton Physical Trainer Defends Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian physical trainer Tahir
Djide defended his program, despite protests from shuttlers
attending his demanding workouts for the Sudirman Cup and World
Championships next month.
</P>
<P>
"With limited time, I can only train them to be able to move
and use their energy as efficiently as possible within their
capabilities," Tahir was quoted by The Jakarta Post Saturday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Our national shuttlers still lack physical fitness. We can see
it from their VO2 max (oxygen capacity in blood) which is only, on
average, 55 points. For a major event like the Sudirman Cup, we
want them to reach at least 67 points," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tahir, who has in the past handled national shuttlers training
for the Thomas and Uber Cups championships, said he could only
increase the athletes' VO2 max by three to four points.
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible to boost their physical condition in such a
short time. All I can do is motivate them to fight harder. I also
told coaches to change their training programs as required (to
meet the needs of athletes). But it's hard to do, because in just
three days many athletes have complained about the tough training,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
Several men's singles players have complained about the severe
measures during the two-week training program. Some said they were
afraid they would sustain injuries.
</P>
<P>
But Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) vice chairman
Agus Wirahadikusumah defended the program, saying Tahir was an
expert in physical training. Agus criticized the national
shuttler's poor physical condition and fighting spirit.
</P>
<P>
PBSI training center director Christian Hadinata acknowledged
that, in general, Indonesian shuttlers were in poor physical
condition.
</P>
<P>
"Physical training can't be conducted in a short time. It needs
time," he said.
</P>

Indonesia will compete in the Sudirman Cup and World

<HEADLINE> Sabonis Voted Greatest International Player in NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- NBA fans picked up Portland's
Arvydas Sabonis as the international player who has had the
biggest worldwide impact in the modern era, making him the winner
of NBA. com's International Week poll.
</P>
<P>
Sabonis received 26.2 percent of the vote, outdistancing the
late Drazen Petroic (17.9 percent), three-time NBA champion Toni
Kukoc (14 percent) and Hawks' great Dikembe Mutombo (12.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
Sabonis traveled the globe for a dozen years, building a
reputation as one of the top big men in the world, before joining
the Portland Trail Blazers in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers drafted Sabonis in 1986, but the Lithuanian
was unable to leave the Soviet Union for a basketball career in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers had to wait nine years for Sabonis, and there
were some questions surrounding the 31-year-old rookie with
chronic Achilles tendon problems.
</P>
<P>
Four years later he has proved worth the wait. He is averaging
12.3 points and 8.3 rebounds for the Blazers, currently battling
the Utah Jazz for the top record in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
His best statistical year so far was 1997-98, when he averaged
16 points and 10 rebounds, but Portland's roster is deeper this
year, with more players sharing minutes and scoring.
</P>
<P>
Before coming to the NBA, Sabonis won an Olympic gold medal
with the Soviet Union in 1988 and a bronze medal with Lithuania in
1992.
</P>
<P>
He was named European Player of the Year four times while
playing for teams in the Soviet Union and Spanish League.
</P>
<P>
Other candidates for top international player of the modern era
were Vlade Divac, Andrew Gaze, Luc Longley, Sarunas Marciulionis,
Oscar Schmidt and Detlef Schrempf.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Produces Over 50,000 Tons of Sugar in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar produced 51,791 tons of
sugar in 1998, according to the latest Economic Indicators
published by the country's Central Statistical Organization.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar cultivates over 100,000 hectares of sugarcane with an
output of over 5 million tons annually.
</P>
<P>
Sugar production of the country remained steady for the past
three years, maintaining at over 50,000 tons annually.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation has adopted
some measures to increase sugar production by disbursing loan and
granting advanced payment to sugarcane growers.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the Myanmar government has
been allowing the private sector to reclaim vacant, virgin, fallow
and wetlands for cultivation of industrial raw material crops
including sugarcane, jute, cotton, Virginia tobacco and coffee.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state-run Myanmar Sugarcane Enterprise (MSE) has
 been building ten more sugar mills in recent years in the areas
of Paukkaung, Pyay and Aunglan in Bago and Magway divisions where
there are enough sugarcane resources.
</P>
<P>
Some of these on-going sugar mill projects are implemented by
companies from China and Thailand under contracts signed with the
MSE in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar exports over 35,000 tons of sugar annually.

<HEADLINE> UEFA Denies "Fourth Berth" Rumours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- European football's governing body
UEFA has denied rumours that a fourth European place will be
available to English clubs in next season's Champions' League if
Manchester United win this year's final.
</P>
<P>
UEFA spokesman Frits Ahlstrom had been quoted by local media as
saying that England would gain an extra place if United become
European champions.
</P>
<P>
But UEFA has now insisted that Ahlstrom's words were
misinterpreted and that a fourth place would be up for grabs only
if United beat Bayern Munich next month - and finishes outside the
Premiership top three.
</P>
<P>
A statement from European football's governing body said: "The
number of participating clubs from England depends upon Manchester
United's final position in the Premier League.
</P>
<P>
"If Manchester United win the Champions' League final and also
finish in first, second or third place in the Premier League, then
three clubs from England would participate in the competition.
</P>
<P>
"The League champions and runners-up would enter the first
group stage directly and the third-placed team would play in the
third qualifying round.
</P>
<P>
"However, if Manchester United win the final, but were to
finish below third place in the Premier League, then four English
clubs would qualify automatically in next season's Champions'
League."
</P>
<P>
That would require a remarkable slump by Alex Ferguson's men in
their last six league matches as they are currently eight points
clear of fourth-placed Leeds and also have a game in hand.
</P>
<P>
Leeds are currently seven points clear of fifth-placed Aston
Villa which have played one game less and were thought to be in
line for a tilt at the Champions' League.
</P>
<P>
The only good news for English clubs is the confirmation that
England are in contention to win an additional Fair Play place in
the UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
England are currently second in the UEFA Fair Play rankings,
sandwiched between leaders Scotland and Norway.

<HEADLINE> Suspension Confirmed for Man United Duo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United players Roy
Keane and Paul Scholes have had their hopes of a Champions' Cup
reprieve quashed by European football governing body UEFA.
</P>
<P>
They were booked in the semi-final victory over Juventus and
the resulting bans rule them out of the final next month.
</P>
<P>
United had hoped they may be spared, but Uefa president,
Lennart Johansson, said Friday: "Although the English public might
want them to play, it would not be fair on the German team and the
bookings must stand."
</P>
<P>
United have been given some good news, however, after UEFA
spokesman Frits Ahlstrom announced that the club may receive more
tickets for the final.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that United and Bayern would receive only 25,
000 tickets each for the clash, despite the Nou Camp having a
capacity in excess of 110,000.
</P>
<P>
But Ahlstrom said: "The priority will be to benefit the two
teams that have qualified for a match in a stadium which will have
a capacity of 98,000 for this game."

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Manager: Our Season is Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League football
club Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli has admitted his side are now
likely to end the season empty handed after they failed to reach
the final of the Cup Winners' Cup.
</P>
<P>
The Blues, who won the trophy against Stuttgart in Stockholm
last year, were defeated 2-1 on aggregate by a single strike from
Real Mallorca's Argentinian star Leo Biagini on Thursday,
according to Friday's local reports.
</P>
<P>
Vialli was quoted as saying: "The future is bright for us
despite this disappointment.
</P>
<P>
"We probably won't win anything this season now but we are
still in a good position in the league and have reached the semi-
final in Europe. It is not a bad record and we are improving all
the time.
</P>
<P>
"You learn in life as you go along and if we want to become a
great side we must live with defeats like this as well as the
victories we are more used to.
</P>
<P>
"On another day we will have that luck and every side needs
that even when they are the best," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea are now trailing third in the Premiership behind
Manchester United and Arsenal after last Sunday's 2-2 home draw
with Leicester in which they threw away a two goal lead.

<HEADLINE> Maloney Supports Cardiff Bid for Boxing Bout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Welsh Rugby Union is stepping
up its campaign to stage the Lennox Lewis-Evander Holyfield
rematch at the new Millennium Stadium in Cardiff - and it has the
backing of Lewis' manager Frank Maloney.
</P>
<P>
Although Las Vegas and New York are hot favourites to host the
heavyweight unification battle, pencilled in for November, Maloney
is keen to see the bout go ahead in the city where his man
defeated Frank Bruno back in 1993.
</P>
<P>
He was in Wales to inspect the site in the company of WRU
chairman Glanmor Griffiths and insisted that Cardiff would be his
personal choice.
</P>
<P>
Maloney said that if the money was available American promoter
Don King would agree too.
</P>
<P>
"I'll be sending Don a presentation pack about the new stadium
and inviting him to come and see it for himself," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure he'd be as impressed as I was, "added Maloney. "From
what I've seen, it's going to be a great place. It's intimidating,
which is fantastic, and with the roof there'll be no problem about
a 4am start."
</P>
<P>
WRU chief Griffiths stressed that the capacity of 72,500 would
make it the largest covered arena in the world and he said
November 13 - one of the dates suggested by American cable network
Home Box Office - would be perfect for the bout.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls After Three Day Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
fell Friday as investors took profits after a three day rally.
</P>
<P>
The Dow closed down 37.51 at 10,689.67. The blue chip stocks
rose 286.65 points in the past three days and investors sell
stocks today to lock in their gains.
</P>
<P>
Investors' concerns about AT&AMP;T's future also gave negative
impact on the Dow index. The telecommunication giant, a Dow
component, made a bid Thursday to buy MediaOne Group for about 58
billion U.S dollars after completing its acquisition of cable
company Tele-Communications Inc. last month.
</P>
<P>
Investors worried that the new bid could hurt AT&AMP;T's earnings
and that worries helped to pull the index down.
</P>
<P>
But the technology heavy Nasdaq index rose 29.08 to 2,590.69 as
Gateway 2000 reported strong earnings. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index rose 1.97 to 1,356.85.

The NYSE composite index fell 1.67 to 639.30. But the American

<HEADLINE> Health Situation of Kosovo Refugees Under Control: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Health Minister Leonard
Soli said Friday that the health situation of the Kosovo refugees
in Albania is under control.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that the problems of food,
accommodation, water and other items all have contributed to
health problems among the refugees, the number of which has risen
to 362,500 by Friday.
</P>
<P>
But thanks to measures adopted by the Albanian government, Soli
said, it is now under control.
</P>
<P>
The health sector in the country has paid a special attention
to the health problems among the Kosovo refugees and a doctor is
posted at each refugee camp to take care of the refugees, the
health minister said.
</P>
<P>
Non-governmental organizations have helped in coordinating,
controlling and planning the delivery of humanitarian aid from the
international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at a refugee center in Tirana said that the most
serious problem is the shortage of medicines.
</P>
<P>
About 300 refugees fell ill on Wednesday in the center and most
of them suffered from cold and diarrhoea, the doctors said.
</P>
<P>
In the meanwhile, Kosovo refugees continued to enter Albania
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Information Minister Musa Ulqini said that 175 Kosovo
refugees crossed the border from the Morina point and 700 others
from the Hani Hotit point by 15:00 local time (1300 GMT) Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Referring to the situation on the northern border of Albania,
it has been calm today until 3 p.m. with no provocation or
incident reported, " Ulqini said.
