<HEADLINE> Toyota Opens New Car Plant in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Japanese auto-maker Toyota has
invested 7 billion baht (about 280 million us dollars) to build a
new plant in East Thailand, which officially opened today.
</P>
<P>
The plant, located in Chachoengsao province, about 80
kilometers east of Bangkok, is equipped with the most advanced car
manufacturing technology ever used in Southeast Asia, the company
claims.
</P>
<P>
The plant, which will produce Toyota passenger cars and spare
parts, will serve as a base for the production of automobiles for
export to neighboring countries as well as for the local market in
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The plant's production capacity is expected to reach 100,000
units by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
In the press workshop where steel is cut and molded into
automobile bodies, three robots are used to assist in the
sheet-feeding and loading processes.
</P>
<P>
At a time of economic slowdown in Thailand, Thai government
officials welcomed the plant, seeing it as the company's
confidence in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Princess Sirindhorn presided over the opening ceremony which
took place today.

<HEADLINE> UK Farmers More Concerned Over EU Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- British farmers are becoming
increasingly worried over the European Union's (EU) ban on British
beef exports after the EU Commission expressed deep doubt over
British proposals on relaxing the global trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
The BBC television reported this morning that it had received a
copy of a letter which two EU commissioners had written to British
Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg casting serious doubts over the
British scheme.
</P>
<P>
In February, the London government proposed that it would
establish a "certified herd scheme" to identify cows from BSE-free
herds which could then be exported.
</P>
<P>
However, EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler and
Consumer Affairs Commissioner Emma Bonino questioned in the letter
whether British farmers' records could be trusted to prove that
some cows were BSE-free.
</P>
<P>
They also said that a new central computerized system of
keeping track of healthy cows had been set up too recently and it
could not be considered as reliable.
</P>
<P>
Sir David Naish, president of the England and Wales National
Farmers' Union, said in a statement issued this afternoon, "I am
very concerned and disappointed at what has apparently been
written in the letter."
</P>
<P>
"We must see real progress and I shall be seeking further
discussions to see how real progress can be made," Naish said.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the worldwide ban on British beef exports last
March when the British government admitted possible links between
mad cow disease and its human equivalent Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive arm of the 15-nation
bloc, has repeatedly ruled out any early easing of the ban, saying
more veterinary inspections were needed to examine whether Britain
had complied fully with last year's Florence agreement which
provided a framework under which the ban might be lifted.

<HEADLINE> Israel To File Complaint Over Hezbollah Shelling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel is to file another
complaint to the Cease-fire Monitoring Committee on South Lebanon
over today's heavy cross-border shelling by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli soldiers were lightly wounded early this morning
when the fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, fired Katyusha
rockets and mortar shells at Israeli targets in the Israeli
self-proclaimed "Security Zone" in south Lebanon, and some
long-range artillery shells even flew across the border and landed
in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the security strip on the Lebanese territory in
1985 to curb cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas over
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Today's shelling lasted for about two hours, during which
Israeli troops returned fire in retaliation. The situation was
stabilized quickly following the shelling.
</P>
<P>
Amiram Levine, Commander of Israeli army's northern command,
said today's attack was a serious violation of the cease-fire
understanding reached last April after Israel's Operation of
Grapes of Wrath.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire agreement forbids shelling of civilian targets
and using civilian cover in military attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel has already lodged a complaint to the Cease-fire
Monitoring Committee for Hezbollah attacks against Israeli
targets and the pro-Israeli militia, South Lebanon Army (SLA). Two
SLA soldiers were killed in the past days of attacks including
shelling and roadside bombings.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-backed SLA patrols in the 1,000-square-kilometer
buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Levine said Israel would file another complaint over
Hezbollah's violation of the cease-fire agreement to the
committee, which comprises representatives from France, Israel,
Lebanon, Syria and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Bronze Statue of Senna Set up at Imola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, Arpil 25 (Xinhua) -- A bronze statue of auto racing
legend Ayrton Senna was set up on Friday at the corner of the San
Marino Grand Prix course where he was killed, according to a
report reaching here from Imola, Italy.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian, a three-time winner of the San Marino Grand
Prix, died of head injuries on May 1, 1994, after his
Williams-Renault rushed out of the course at the Tamburello corner
and rammed into a concrete wall during the eighth lap of the race.
</P>
<P>
The bronze, created by local artist Stefano Pierotti, features
life-size Senna sitting with his arms folded.
</P>
<P>
No family members attended the ceremony. Neither did any
drivers, who were busy with free practice sessions Friday.

<P>
KATHMANDU, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States Government
has agreed to provide a total of nearly 30 million dollars of
grant assistance to Nepal's agricultural and health sectors, the
Nepali Finance Ministry announced today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. grant will be used for promoting sustainable
production of forest and agricultural products and improving
maternal and child health in the country, according to the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Two separate agreements on the grant were signed here today
between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
Under the first agreement, 25 million dollars of the grant will
be earmarked for a five-year program aimed at enhancing local
people's income through increased sustainable production of forest
and high-valued agricultural products, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Another agreement is related to a U.S.-supported health program
which is expected to help reduce the rates of fertility and child
mortality in Nepal and prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS-related
diseases, it added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Eliminate Child Illiteracy by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has made
a resolve, as the centerpiece of its anti-illiteracy campaign, to
bring all school-age kids back into classrooms by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The government agenda, said Vietnamese media reports today,
also calls for reducing the illiteracy rate in other age groups,
so as to meet its national standards for illiteracy elimination.
</P>
<P>
For now, official count indicates that 91 out of every 100
adult Vietnamese are able to read and write.
</P>
<P>
Among the rest of them, about 220,000 to 280,000 Vietnamese
attend literacy classes each year, and 1.8 million people were
brought out of illiteracy in the past six years.
</P>
<P>
However, there remain 1.4 million kids staying outside schools
nationwide, with 70 percent of them in mountainous or coastal
provinces and districts and the Mekong River Delta.
</P>
<P>
To bring them back and reverse the increasing drop-outs, the
government has made universal primary education a national goal,
which has already been achieved by 77 percent of provinces and
districts.

<HEADLINE> OECD Reports on Norwegian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) today warned Norway against
granting too generous wage increases which could lead to higher
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian economy is nearing boiling point, the OECD warned in
its annual report. "It's too early to say that a red light is
starting to blink, but in some sectors of the economy it has
changed from green to amber."
</P>
<P>
It advised the Norwegian government to pursue a restrictive
financial and monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Despite the warnings, the organization admitted that the
economic growth in Norway has been remarkable.
</P>
<P>
Export potential is also promising, due to accelerating
economic growth in Norway's main European markets, it said.
</P>
<P>
Both investments and demand in the Nordic country will remain
at a high level, though somewhat below the level of the past two
years, it added.
</P>
<P>
According to OECD, Norway's economic growth will also slow down
compared to the extremely high growth of 5 percent in the gross
domestic product (GDP) that was registered in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Big Merger of Two US Phone Firms Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The 22 billion U.S. dollar
merger of Bell Atlantic and Nynex, two phone companies in the
eastern United States, was approved by the Justice Department of
the Federal government Thursday after an intensive nine-month
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department's anti-trust division said in a
statement that after thorough investigation and analysis, it
concluded that the putting together of two neighboring Bell
telephone companies "doest not violate the anti-trust laws."
</P>
<P>
The department's decision removes the last major hurdle to the
mergering deal that would create a mammoth new company called Bell
Atlantic, only next to the AT&AMP;T, the No. One telephone company in
the country, the New York Times said in a report today.
</P>
<P>
The combined company, which will be based in New York City,
will serve 39 million customers in 13 states and the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
The merger, which was announced almost one year ago, has yet
to be finally approved by the Federal Communications Commission.
Regulatory experts predicted that the commission's approval would
be fairly routine, now that the Justice Department had signed off
on it.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Navy Chief Mansurul Haq Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of Pakistan's
Ministry of Defense said here today the government has retired
Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Mansurul Haq, with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
Details of resignation of the navy chief were not immediately
available.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said today that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
asked Admiral Mansurul Haq to resign Thursday in the wake of
widespread accusation of alleged corruption leveled against him.
</P>
<P>
Mansurul Haq called on the prime minister yesterday, and he was
asked to resign immediately since he was facing accusation of
alleged corruption, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Mansurul Haq had sought earlier retirement almost six and a
half months before the completion of his three-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
Government sources said today that the decision was taken by
Nawaz Sharif after giving due consideration to reports that the
reputation of the navy chief was bringing a bad name to the entire
naval force.
</P>
<P>
Haq, who was appointed navy chief in October 1994, just a week
before his retirement, told the local media recently that "I have
nothing to hide, as I have done nothing wrong."
</P>
<P>
Under the constitutional arrangement, restored by the 13th
Amendment Bill, power to appoint or remove services chiefs now
rests with the prime minister.

<HEADLINE> UK Economy Grows 3 Pct Annually in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain's economy grew by a
stronger-than-expected 1 percent in the first quarter of this
year, leaving the annual growth rate at 3 percent and raising the
likelihood of a rise in interest rates, showed official figures
today.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics said today the figures were
above economists' forecast of a growth rate of 0.9 percent and 2.9
percent respectively and were also higher than the 2.6 percent
year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, this was the economy's strongest rate of quarterly
growth since the third quarter of 1994 and its highest annual rate
since the first quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, figures continued to show a split between booming
services and retail and subdued manufacturing, with the former up
3.9 percent annually, roughly twice as fast as the production
industries.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the figures showed that the economy
remained buoyant during the first quarter and supported the case
for a post-election rise in interest or tax rates to clamp down on
the threat of inflation.

The industrial park will include, among others, export processing
zones and small to medium-scale enterprise cubicles.
</P>
<P>
The industrial park project, to be built over an area of
1,600 hectares, is estimated to cost more than 1.27 billion US
dollars, and is expected to create over 30,000 jobs and earn in
excess of 91 million dollars in the first five years, Ndudzo
said. enditem

<HEADLINE> U.N. Objective Attitude Toward Cyprus Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Northern Cyprus leader Rauf
Denktas called today on the U.N. Security Council to adopt a
"realistic and objective attitude" toward the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the Security Council will feel the need to take
up the conflict from a new perspective, thus they will tell the
Greek Cypriot side that it can not be the legitimate government in
Cyprus," said he at a meeting held to discuss the latest
developments on the divided island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He made this call after talks with the U.N. Secretary General's
Deputy Special Envoy for Cyprus Gustave Feissel, and before the
Security Council meets in the coming days to discuss what to do
with this problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed on the island to protect the northern third of Cyprus in
the wake of an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 35,000 Turkish troops are stationed in the
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which is only recognized by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Cyprus Flag Radio TV Wednesday, Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel said that the destiny of Turkey and
northern Cyprus were "one and the same."
</P>
<P>
He said that there were two different administrations between
the two sides on the island, and that neither side should claim
precedence over the other.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president pointed out that any solution must be
based on the "realities and justice," and "this can be achieved
only by the free will of both communities and negotiations
between the two sides on the island."
</P>
<P>
He added that "A bi-zonal, bi-communal, politically equal
society with Turkey as guarantor is indispensable for a
solution."

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 359 kilomatres of land along
Zimbabwe's north-eastern border areas infested with an estimated one
million landmines will be demined under a European Union-sponsored
project later this year.
</P>
<P>
The mine fields, constantly posing a risk to people and livestock,
are still active years after the war which brought Zimbabwe's
independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
EU technical advisor Alejandro Montalban said here today, ''When
we launch the tender in July, we will give four months for the
companies to submit their documents which will be opened by the
commission and the government.''
</P>
<P>
He said that the mine clearance, to cost over 11.5 million US
dollars, was expected to be completed by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
''It is a question of a meticuluous operation because it is not an
easy area as there is a lot of vegetation and a large number of
mines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Between 1974 and 1977, the Rhodesian army is said to have laid
seven minefields at various locations along the country's border with
Mozambique and Zambia to limit incursions by nationalist
forces entering from enighbouring countries. enditem

<HEADLINE> WHO on Worrying Health Situation in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Cholera and other diseases are
gripping Zaire with around 1000 people struck and some 100 lives
taken by cholera by the end of mid-April, according to the World
Health Organization (WHO) today.
</P>
<P>
In Kasese refugee camp in Kisangani, the cumulative number of
cholera cases reached 550 at the end of the week of April 19, with
67 deaths. Three cholera cases, including two deaths, have also
been recorded among the local population in Biaro, 40 kilometers
from Kisangani. In Mbandaka, on the Zaire river, a cholera
epidemic continues and has already caused 302 cases and 19 deaths.
</P>
<P>
In the Zairian capital of Kinshasa, where cases of cholera have
been signaled without interruption since the beginning of the
year, a substantial increase in the number of recorded cases
occurred in the first weeks of April. The situation in the capital
appears to have improved recently but it remains pre-occupying,
considering the lack of organized health systems.
</P>
<P>
Other endemic diseases such as bloody diarrhoea, meningitis,
malaria and measles are re-emerging in areas around Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
WHO has reinforced its epidemiological surveillance stations in
Kisangani, Lubumbashi and Mbandaka to combat the risk of
epidemics.
</P>
<P>
A WHO team comprising, notably, two epidemiologists, is
scheduled to arrive in Kisangani on April 29, and cholera kits for
the treatment of 3,000 people will be flown in from Entebbe,
Uganda, where they are currently stored.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Helicopters Fly Pilgrims Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi helicopters which flew to
the Iraqi-Saudi borders earlier this week has begun  transporting
Iraqi pilgrims home, the Iraqi news agency (INA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said that at least one helicopter had
taken off from the Iraqi border city of Ar'ar and was flying a
batch of pilgrims to Mosul, about 400 kilometers north of the
capital Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The transport home of the elderly and sick pilgrims, who went
to the Saudi holy city of Mecca for the Hajj, will last for
several days, according to the unidentified spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government sent eight military helicopters on Monday
and Tuesday to Ar'ar to pick up about 100 elderly and sick Iraqi
pilgrims, defying a U.S.-led air blockade over northern and
southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims went to Mecca on board an Iraqi passenger plane on
April 9, which marked the first overseas flight conducted by Iraq
since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The helicopters taking back the pilgrims home flew across the
no-fly zone imposed over southern Iraq by the United States,
Britain and France, and landed safely at the Iraqi-Saudi border
area, some 350 kilometers southwest of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has expressed deep concern and great anger
over the Iraqi challenge, saying that Baghdad should have asked
for the U.N. permission in advance to fly over the no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
Washington initiated a motion at the U.N. Security Council to
condemn Iraq immediately after the April 9 flight, but it was
rejected by other council members.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iraqi government argued that it had exercised its
legitimate right to fly pilgrims for the hajj and had violated no
U.N. resolution.

<HEADLINE> Russian Officials, Press Hail Jiang's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian officials and the press
hailed the ongoing visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in
Russia, making positive comments and giving extensive coverage on
the event.
</P>
<P>
Both political and media circles highly praised the
Sino-Russian Joint Statement on Multipolarization of the World and
the Establishment of New International Order, signed by Jiang and
his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin on April 23.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Aeleznev, speaker of the Russian State Duma, the lower
house of parliament, expressed his full support to the statement.
He said the Duma had always been striving for the ideal carried in
the statement.
</P>
<P>
A commentary in the Russian newspaper Red Star said that the
statement reflected the two countries' determination to abandon
the "Cold War" mentality and jointly push the world toward
multipolarization.
</P>
<P>
Officials and the press also welcomed the agreement on mutual
reduction of military forces in border areas signed Thursday by
Jiang and his counterparts of Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Duma's International Affairs
Committee, hailed the agreement as "a breakthrough in arms
reduction in Asia."
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, the situation along the lengthy border
between China and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
will be improved, which is particularly important when the CIS'
other border areas are unstable.
</P>
<P>
A commentator for Itar-Tass news agency said in an article that
the five-nation accord showed the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) members and those who are eager to join the
bloc that "national security can be achieved through strengthening
trust instead of resorting to the eastward expansion."
</P>
<P>
The Red Star newspaper commented that China and the four CIS
countries set up a "non-alliance security model," which signified
that trust between the five countries in the military security
field has reached a "brand new level."
</P>
<P>
Another newspaper The News acclaimed the compromise that the
five countries made in agreeing to mutual reduction of military
forces along border areas, saying it is "unique on the Asian
continent, where border disputes are piling up."
</P>
<P>
The Commercialist Daily highlighted in an article the
obligations assigned in the accord not to resort to armed forces
or threat to use armed forces, saying it is more important than
the reduction of military forces in border areas.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that Russian will have nothing to worry about
the eastern section of its borders in the coming years.

the maneuver because possible threat may come from these two
points.
</P>

"Path to Jerusalem" held on Qeshm Island near the strait of
Hormuz. Qeshm is the largest island in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>

designed warfare gadgets at the last stage of the maneuvers and
IRGC fighters proved their combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
New armored vehicles, carriers and flotillas designed by
self-sufficiency units of IRGC underwent stern tests during the
war games, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that over 40,000
forces were deployed for the landing operation on the strategic

<HEADLINE> Africa Needs Peace: Says Kenyan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi today warned that economic development in the African
continent would not bear fruit unless there is peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
"The economic development strategies we have formulated remain
vulnerable so long as the social, political and economic future
of neighboring countries is still uncertain," said Moi when he
officially opened the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair in the in
Zimbabwe's city of Bulawayo.
</P>
<P>
"It is my hope that a lasting solution for peace is reached in
Zaire and the entire Great Lakes region to enable the citizens of
this region to direct their energies on nation-building," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan president added that many lives have been lost and
ordinary people displaced from their homes is a matter that
"should prick the conscience of every person of goodwill."
</P>
<P>
Moi said Kenya and Zimbabwe should strive to implement
strategies for the industrialization of sub-Saharan Africa by the
beginning of the next century.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, he said, have made great strides towards
strengthening economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the signing of a bilateral trade agreement and
establishment of the Joint Permanent Commission for Economic,
Scientific and Technical Cooperation last year formed the basis
of sound economic and cultural relations between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: No Worry About Chinese-Russian Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
today that he will not worry about a treaty, signed by the
Chinese and Russian presidents in Moscow on their friendship
partnership, so long as it is in consistent with what he said is
positive partnership.
</P>
<P>
At a photo session before his talks with Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, Clinton said, "The United States
should have a partnership over the long run for stability in the
Asia-Pacific region that includes our long-standing alliance with
Japan and a positive relationship with both Russia and with
China."
</P>
<P>
"As long as any agreement they make is consistent with that
kind of positive partnership and is not directed in any negative
way toward their neighbors, I think that we don't have anything to
worry about."
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, who arrived in Washington Thursday, echoed Clinton's
remarks, saying, "That was a splendid answer to the question."
</P>
<P>
In his first visit to the United States as the prime minister,
Hashimoto is expected to discuss with Clinton bilateral relations
as well as regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Hashimoto and Clinton are expected to discuss a
longer-term review of U.S.-Japanese defense cooperation guidelines
that is slated to be completed by fall.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders might discuss a U.S.-South Korean proposal for
four-party peace talks on the Korean Peninsula. The Democratic
People's Republic of Korea is going to give an answer if it will
participate in the four-party talks, which include both Koreas,
the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
The trade issue is also expected on the agenda as the U.S.
trade deficit with Japan, though narrowed last year, is likely to
widen again due largely to a weak yen and a strong dollar.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has urged Hashimoto in a letter to stabilize Japan's
financial system and reduce the trade deficit with the United
States.

NICOSIA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has
decided to cancel a planned trip by hundreds of Greek Cypriots to
the Monastery of Saint Andreas in northern Cyprus this Sunday to
mark the Greek Orthodox holiday of Easter.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today by Commissioner to the President for
Humanitarian Affairs Takis Christopoulos after failing to reach an
agreement with the Turkish Cypriot north on the matter.
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement:"The decision to cancel the pilgrimage
was taken after the occupation regime insisted to set conditions
as to the list of persons who would visit the Monastery, which the
government of the Republic categorically dismisses."
</P>
<P>
However, he didn't specify what conditions the Turkish Cypriots
have set.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, some 450 Turkish Cypriots crossed the Green
Line to the Greek Cypriot south for a pilgrimage to Hala Sultan
Tekke Mosque near the coastal town of Larnaca on the occasion of
the Muslim religious feast of "Kurban Bayram."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side had promised, as a good-will gesture
on its part, to allow Greek Cypriots to visit Monastery of
Apostolos Andreas at the tip of the Karpass Peninsula in northern
Cyprus on Greek Orthodox Easter, which falls on April 27.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Humanitarian Affairs Commissioner
Christopoulos had received over 2,000 applications for the
visit. But the United Nations said the Turkish Cypriot side will
be prepared to accommodate 600 people.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his regret, Christopoulos assured that his office
will continue its efforts to facilitate such humanitarian events
"without any conditions or restrictions."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Waldemar Rokoszewski, spokesman of the U.N. Forces
in Cyprus (UNFICYP), said today that "it is regretful that things
developed in this way," noting that such contacts "would be
beneficial and helpful in a broader sense."
</P>
<P>
He described as "impressive" the number of 600 Greek Cypriots
who were arranged to visit the Saint Andreas Monastery upon
insistence of the Turkish Cypriot north since it was the first
from a series of events planned.
</P>
<P>
"UNFICYP hopes for more willingness in order to bring them to
successful end," the spokesman said, adding that "there are more
projects in the pipeline."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government welcomed earlier this week contacts of
this nature between Greek and Turkish Cypriots as a good way to
"break the ice" between the two communities on the island, as they
encourage rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot south and
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops landed and
took control of 37 percent of the island in the wake of a coup
seeking union with Greece.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Popular Movement for
the Liberation of Angola (PMLA) today expressed optimism toward
the country's peace process cemented by the establishment of its
government of national unity and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Dino Matross, member of PMLA's central organ, the political
bureau, said here today that the ruling and opposition parties
are seeking solutions to the remaining issues including building
an united army and local authorities in the post-war era.
</P>
<P>
The solution to these two key problems would facilitate free
and safe movement of goods and persons around the country,
recovery of national economy, and finally, improvement of living
standard of the ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
Matross said peace, above all, is the founding element to
national reconstruction and economic development of the
southern African country.

<HEADLINE> France, Cuba Sign Agreement on Investment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Brushing aside a protest from the
United States, France and Cuba signed here today an agreement on
reciprocal investment protection, which is mainly aimed at
protecting French enterprises investing in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by French Minister of Industry Frank
Borotra and Cuban Minister of Foreign Investment Ibrahim Ferradaz
Garcia, said that foreign investors will be entitled to the same
treatment as Cuban investors in France.
</P>
<P>
It limits the possibility of expropriation by Cuba of
properties of foreign enterprises, and lays out terms for their
compensation if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which has been maintaining a trade embargo
upon Cuba for 37 years, protested Thursday against France's plan
to sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Borotra hailed France's signing of the agreement today, saying
that France has become the 19th country to sign such a kind of
agreement with Cuba since the Caribbean nation opened itself to
foreign investments in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"In Europe, Germany, the Great Britain, Italy, Spain and
Switzerland have already done the same thing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French businessmen investing in Cuba today described
the signing of the agreement as a "very good thing," according to
the Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
Michel Villand, vice-president of a Franco-Cuban bakery-pastry
joint venture which was inaugurated by President Fidel Castro last
week in Havana, expressed his wish that the agreement will bring
more French enterprises to Cuba.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization (ILO) will start to set up 2,000 mini-enterprises in
Bie Province, Angola from May this year to help settle soldiers
of the former warring sides.
</P>
<P>
ILO expert Tito Balboa said in Bie's provincial capital Kuito
today that the project, with 10 million U.S. Dollars funded by
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the governments
of Switzerland and Holland, will enable more than 600 disbanded
soldiers from the Angolan government army and the former rebel
UNITA movement to be settled.
</P>
<P>
The 30-month project will provide the disbanded soldiers with
technical training and vocational education in agriculture and
animal husbandry, fishery, electrical engineering, mechanics,
sawing, piping maintenance and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
The ILO experts are discussing with local authorities over
ways to implement the project with some concerned agencies in Bie
Province, which is one of the provinces most severely damaged by
the civil war.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the province will receive 2,606 soldiers
and their nearly 30,000 dependents, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Air Algeria Resumes Algiers-Paris Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Algeria's national carrier Air
Algeria today resumed its flight between Algiers and the
Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport of Paris after two years of its
suspension of direct flight between the two capitals.
</P>
<P>
Air Algeria, which is the only air company flying direct
flights between Algiers and Paris, suspended its flight in June
1995 after it refused to transfer its terminal from Orly-Sud
airport of Paris to Roissy airport, as was requested by France.
</P>
<P>
Air Algeria thought the French request, based on security
reasons, as "discriminatory."
</P>
<P>
The dispute also hurt the relations between France and Algeria,
and an agreement on the resumption of the flight was agreed upon
in March after numerous talks were held by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
An Air Algeria Boeing 767 passenger jumbo plane took off for
Algiers from Roissy airport at 17:05 this afternoon, 35 minutes
late of schedule.

<HEADLINE> Sales of Existing Homes in US Down in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Sales of existing homes in the
U.S. declined by 2.8 percent in March resulting from adverse
weather and rising mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Association of Realtors said today that sales
of single-family homes slipped to a seasonally adjusted 4.11
million annual rate but they were still considered healthy.
</P>
<P>
The association also revised the February rate down to 4.23
million from an initial estimate of 4.26 million and the pace
remained second only to the record 4.28 million last May.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales of the previously owned homes rose by 1.6
percent in the Northeast and were unchanged in the South.
</P>
<P>
But sales plunged by 8.3 percent in the Midwest because of the
flooding and fell by 5.1 percent in the West.
</P>
<P>
The national median price of an existing home was 120,000
dollars in March, up 3.7 percent from 115,700 dollars a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the bad weather had resulted in the decline
of the existing homes sales in March. But the National Association
of Realtors also attributed the slowdown last month to rising
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.9 percent in March,
up from 7.65 percent in February and 7.62 percent in March 1996,
according to the U.S. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
</P>
<P>
Economists have said that the continuing strength in home sales
reflects a robust economy in the U.S. and many analysts believe it
will lead to another interest-rate increase in May to prevent any
acceleration of inflation.

<HEADLINE> Venue for Mobutu-Kabila Talks Remains Undecided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators were making
progress on a venue and date for the long-awaited peace talks
between Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader
Laurent Kabila, United Nations special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun said
in Cape Town tonight.
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun made the remarks following the day-long consultations
between himself, South African Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister
Aziz Pahad and other concerned role-players in the Zairean
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South African Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman
Pieter Swanepoel said the negotiators were "working on
suggestions" which will be conveyed to Mobutu and Kabila, who
will have to make the final decision.
</P>
<P>
No venue has yet been agreed upon for the first ever
face-to-face talks between Mobutu and Kabila since the breakout
of the civil war in Zaire last October, said an informed source
close to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
A firm proposal had reportedly been made to Mobutu and Kabila,
but they had not yet responded formally, said the source. All
negotiators, however, declined to give any details about the
issue so far.
</P>
<P>
A unconfirmed source earlier today quoted Mobutu's spokesman
in Kinshasa as saying that the 66-year-old ailing president is
prepared to meet Kabila in Libreville, capital of Gabon.
</P>
<P>
Other proposed venues for the talks also included Brazzaville
of Congo, Luanda of Angola, all within less than an hour's trip
from Kinshasa, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Last week, South African President Nelson Mandela extended a
formal invitation to Mobutu, offering to host the first direct
peace talks in South Africa, but Mobutu reportedly indicated that
he could not travel to the country for the talks because of his
ill health despite of his willingness to do so.

<HEADLINE> Flights Between Algeria, France Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Air Algeria, the national
carrier of Algeria, resumed its flights to Paris today after
nearly two years of suspension, informed sources of the Algerian
airline said here.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three flights will be operated by the airline per week
from the Algerian capital Algiers and other cities in the country
to Paris, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Flights were suspended in the summer of 1995, months after the
Hijacking of an Air France passenger plane by Muslim militants waging
an insurgency in the African state since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Three passengers were killed in the hijacking plus four
hijackers who forced the plane to fly to Marseille from Algiers on
the Christmas Eve in 1994. A French squad stormed the plane and
ended the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
The current move came following dispute between the Algerian
company and the Air France that lasted a year and a half on the
use of Charles de Gaulle Airport.
</P>
<P>
In end end the both sides agreed that Air Algeria now arrives and
departs from Charles de Gaulle airport, north of Paris, rather
than Orly airport to the south, its previous base.
</P>
<P>
Algeria initially considered the measures as "racist" because of
extra security precautions, which include an isolated departure
area for the Algerian flights.

JOHANNESBURG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's leading arms
manufacturer Denel has signed an agreement with its French-German
counterpart, Eurocopter, to co-produce and develop its Rooivalk
attack helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Denel said in a statement today that a strategic alliance to

The agreement provided for engineering interchanges and joint
procurement, enabling Denel's aerospace and defense industries to
enhance their technological know-how.
</P>
<P>
It would also pave the way for more joint ventures,
particularly with regard to a light utility helicopter
replacement project in the South African air force.
</P>
<P>
"Both Denel and Eurocopter are convinced that joint
cooperation will significantly enhance their position in today's
highly competitive global market," added the statement.

<HEADLINE> New York City Sued by Government on Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The New York City was sued
Thursday by the Justice Department of the Federal Government for
its failure to build an infiltration plant to clean drinking water
from its most polluted reservoirs, the New York Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The affected reservoirs, in the city's Croton watershed, still
produce potable water, about 10 percent of the city's supply, but
have been tainted with wast water from sewage treatment plants,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Since June 1993, the city has been in violation of the Federal
Safe Drinking Water Act, for failing to filter the Croton water,
but it had been granted a series of extensions by the
Environmental Protection Agency and New York state health
officials as it explored sites and technical options for a
filtration plant.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the E.P.A. defended the decision to sue, saying
that the filtration plant was needed to protect public health.
Although in theory the city could be fined of more than 27 million
U.S. dollars, E.PA. officials said that their main goal was to
force the city to build a plant that has been planned for 20 years
but delayed by the cost and disputes over where it will be built.
The city has 20 days to respond to the court action.

<HEADLINE> British Minister Hints EMU Need Not Be Irrevocable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) - British Finance Minister Kenneth
Clarke said today the European economic and monetary union (EMU),
which is set to be launched in January 1999, need not be
irrevocable.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC television, Clarke said the intention
of going into monetary union would be that "this is intended to be
permanent in the foreseeable future."
</P>
<P>
However, Clarke said some previous monetary unions had
ultimately ended, including one in southern Europe and another
between Britain and the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
"We were in monetary union with the Irish Republic for about 50
years. They pulled out of that in the 1970s. So these things can
be disentangled. But no one should go into it believing it was
anything other than a lasting situation.," he added.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, there is never a 'never' in politics," he said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks seems to be at odds with the Maastricht Treaty,
which states that the exchange rates of participating countries
will be irrevocably fixed and that they will then be replaced by a
single currency.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has since decided that the new currency will
be known as the euro. Euro notes and coins are due to be
introduced by 2002.
</P>
<P>
But Clarke also played down with the worry that if Britain
joined a single currency, it would hand power over its economic
affairs to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't affect our tax, It wouldn't affect our public
spending. It wouldn't stop a British chancellor giving a budget
and it wouldn't damage our national sovereignty," he said.
</P>
<P>
There is a strong suspicion to the single currency among the
British people who fear the monetary union would strip them of
their sovereignty and independence.
</P>
<P>
"The idea that all our reserves get given to the Europeans, or
-- as a constituent said to me the other day -- get given to the
Bundesbank, that is completely untrue," the financial minister
said.

<HEADLINE> Algerian President Meets UN special envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Liamine
Zeroual met here today with James Baker, the U.N. Secretary
General's special envoy to parties to the Western Sahara dispute.
</P>
<P>
The meeting focused on the Western Sahara peace process and the
obstacles obstructing the implementation of the UN plan to hold a
referendum on the Western Sahara's future, informed Algerian
sources said.
</P>
<P>
James Baker, former U.S. secretary of state, told reporters after
the meeting that he is still on a fact-finding mission aimed at
settling the longstanding dispute between Morocco and the
Algerian-backed Polisario Front.
</P>
<P>
The two sides were locked in a 15-year-old warfare before the
U.N. proposed in 1992 that a referendum would be held to determine the
fate of the former Spanish colony.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. initiative has stalled due to differences
over who should have the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
Baker described his meeting with President Zeroual as "very
good", adding he would submit a new assessment report on the
situation in the Western Sahara to the U.N. Chief.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bankrupt State Firms' Workers First Priority: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Top priority should be given to
relocate the employees of bankrupt state enterprises, and the
money obtained from the sale of the firms' land-use right must
first be used to help the workers find jobs and pay for their
pensions.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made in Beijing today by Chen Qingtai,
Vice-Minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission, in
response to questions after his speech on China's state enterprise
reform during the two-day international symposium "Into the 21st
Century -- China's Economic Reform and Liberalization of
Accountancy Services".
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that such spending can by no means cause
losses of state assets, since the state owes state firm employees
a social security system that the country has never provided.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister attributed the situation to the long-time
absence of a social security system in China.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that if the sum from selling the land-use right is
too low to pay for the relocation and pension costs, money from
the sale of other assets of the state enterprises should be used
first for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
The senior official also answered questions about the
arrangements that would be made for retirees and the re-employment
of laid-off workers in the state sector.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, all retirees from the state firms are supported by
their former employers, he said, noting that the country is now
working to reform the old system and set up a socialized pension
plan which places all retirees under the care of society, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reemployment centers have been set up in many cities
to provide new job opportunities to the laid-off workers from
state companies, but the center will stop aiding those workers who
turn down two job offers within two years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister said that the key to restructuring state
enterprises is to speed up the flow of state assets and employees
of state firms.

<HEADLINE> HK Experts Urge H-Share Firms To Improve Financial Disclosure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Two accounting experts from Hong
Kong suggested here today that Chinese firms listed in overseas
stock markets should attach greater importance to financial
disclosure so as to meet the needs of investors.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Edgar Cheng, chairman of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and
Francis Leung, managing director of Hong Kong-based Peregrine
Investments Holdings Ltd., made the suggestion at an international
seminar entitled "Into the 21st Century -- China's Economic Reform
and Liberalization of Accountancy Services."
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, 26 Chinese firms have issued H-shares
in Hong Kong since 1993, nine of which also are listed in New York
or London.
</P>
<P>
Some of the firms have scored notable achievements in meeting
the requirements of the capital market in terms of financial
disclosure and other factors, they said, noting that Shanghai
Petrochemical has received "Best Disclosure" and "Best Management"
awards by the Hong Kong exchange.
</P>
<P>
However, they said, some of the H-share companies have been
criticized by investors for various lapses in financial
disclosure, such as failure to follow their business development
pledge and changing investment strategy.
</P>
<P>
As a result, some 60 percent of the listed companies' share
price are still trading below the issue price, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The situation is gradually changing as the Chinese firms have
become more and more familiar with the capital market and means of
operation, they said.
</P>
<P>
The experts said it's a sign of success that the Chinese
government plans to list another 38 companies overseas.

<HEADLINE> Samsonov Humiliates Waldner in Table Tennis Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Belarus' world No. 4
Vladimir Samsonov stunned table tennis all-time great Jan-Ove
Waldner in the men's team competition of the 44th World
Championships here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov, a player willing to rally until his rival leaves an
opening, changed the tactics and took initiative in attacking,
winning the second rubber against Sweden's world No. 2 21-6, 21-7
in 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Belarussian, tipped as a favorite for the men's
singles championship, outlasted Jorgen Persson in his second
outing before Waldner completed Sweden's 3-2 win and third
straight victory in the group by beating Evgueni Chtchetinine
21-16, 21-18.
</P>
<P>
Waldner, the only male player who has won a Grand Slam of the
Olympic, world championships and World Cup titles, wilted under
the barrages and showed justifiable signs of nerves when Samsonov
put up a very aggressive game.
</P>
<P>
"I am a slow starter and I will play better in later games,"
said the 31-year-old Waldner, who lost a set to lowly ranked
Austrian Qian Qianli on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was Samsonov's first win over Waldner since he upset the
Swede 3-1 in the Swedish Open final in December, 1995. Waldner
edged out Samsonov 3-2 in the World Cup last year and got the
better of the Belarussian again in the Qatar Open in February.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov showed his composure beyond years in the fourth game
against 1991 world champion Persson, who won Sweden's first point
by nipping Belarus' defensive player Chtchetinine.
</P>
<P>
With one set down, Samsonov used his top spins and solid
defence to win two sets in a row. The score was 18-21, 21-19,
21-14.
</P>
<P>
Thomas von Scheele snatched the third game against Vitali
Nekhvedovitch, winning 21-10, 21-18.
</P>
<P>
Sweden has entered seven world championship finals since the
1980s and won four, in 1983, 1989, 1991 and 1993.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Meets Algerian President on West Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations envoy for West
Sahara, James Baker, held talks here today with Algerian President
Liamine Zeroual on the situation in West Sahara, where the
Algerian government supports the pro-independence Polisario Front.
</P>
<P>
Baker, the former U.S. secretary of state who is now on a
fact-finding mission in North Africa, said his visit is aimed at
making a preliminary exploration of the situation in West Sahara.
</P>
<P>
Baker was nominated in March by United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan as his envoy for West Sahara, after
the world body failed to arrange a self-determination referendum
initially scheduled for 1992 in the former Spanish colony.
</P>
<P>
He has met Moroccan King Hassan II in Rabat and will meet
Polisario leader Mohammed Abdelaziz in Tindouf, an Algerian border
town bordering Morocco, before going to Mauritania on the last leg
of his tour.
</P>
<P>
Baker, who knows King Hassan and other Arab leaders well
because of his diplomatic missions during the 1991 Gulf War as
U.S. secretary of state under President George Bush, said he is
working on a report on the situation of West Sahara to be
presented to the U.N. chief.
</P>
<P>
Morocco annexed West Sahara in 1976 one year after Spain
granted the largely desert region independence.
</P>
<P>
Morocco and the Polisario are disputing over the criteria of
registering for voting in the U.N.-sponsored referendum in West
Sahara, as Morocco insists on letting Moroccan immigrants to
participate in the vote while excluding tens of thousands Saharian
refugees living in exile in Algeria.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A moderate earthquake with a
magnitude of 5.0 struck Southern California early Saturday
morning, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or
property damage.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Geological Survey says the quake was an aftershock of
a massive temblor measuring 6.7 that shook exactly the same spot
of North Ridge, California, in January 1994, killing 60 people and
causing some 30 million dollars in property damage.
</P>
<P>
The USGS says the latest quake was followed by a magnitude 4.0
jolt just three minutes later. Several smaller aftershocks have
been reported since then, with dwindling size and strength.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report said residents from West Los Angeles
to Pasadena reported feeling the quake and area firefighters were
put on alert status.

<HEADLINE> Promotion of Defense Industry, Army Building Called for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese military leader
has called for further development of the defense industry and
more progress in building of the army based on hard work and
pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqing, vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission,
made the call during an inspection of research and manufacturing

When visiting Yanliang District in the provincial capital of
Xi'an, known as west China's "Aircraft City," Liu said that China
has made great achievements in developing aircraft manufacturing
technology over the past decades.
</P>
<P>
"With new technological revolutions progressing rapidly around
the world, China should focus on promoting further development of
its defense industry to help maintain world peace and national
security," said Liu, who is also a Standing Committee member of
the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China.
</P>
<P>
He said the state will render full support to the development
of new aircraft, adding that both a pioneering spirit based on
hard work, which is a legacy from war times, and scientific
approach are key to achieving a rapid and healthy growth of
China's aircraft manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
Liu stressed a correct ideological line, development of more
advanced weapons and learning of new technology as crucial to the
building of the army.
</P>
<P>
He called on the army to learn from advanced technology and
draw on the experiences of other countries, saying that "only by
doing so can our army shoulder the heavy task of defending the
socialist modernization, accomplishing national reunification, and
maintaining world peace."
</P>
<P>
Liu added the army must follow the leadership of the Party, and
its devotion to the country and its duty should not change no
matter how much the equipment is improved.
</P>
<P>
In meeting with local leaders, Liu said that Shaanxi has
consistently supported the army despite limited funds, and he
hoped the province will make new progress in this respect.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak held talks here today with Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah and senior government officials on ways to
promote bilateral relations and the stalled Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed some regional and international
issues of mutual concern, especially way of getting the stalled
peace march moving again.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak arrived here earlier today on a short visit to Kuwait
within the framework of a regional tour that will also take him
to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. This is Mubarak's
4th visit to Kuwait since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Mubarak was greeted at the airport by Amir
Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, acting Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, Kuwaiti defense
minister, finance minister and other top government officials.
</P>
<P>
The talks came within the framework of continuos consultations
between the Kuwaiti and Egyptian leaders on matters of mutual
concern.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the Amir's palace said the high-level talks
were "cordial," which covered bilateral relations and a number
of issues of Arab concern, including the latest developments of
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
But the statement did not give details as to whether the
two leaders had agreed upon a special common stand on the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said in a televised interview Friday in Cairo that he
was not in favor of holding an Arab summit for the time being for
fear it world only complicate the already-deadlocked Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We (Arab leaders) can meet when there is a defined issue to
discuss, but holding it (an Arab summit) at (for) the time being
is meaningless," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his readiness to hold a mini-summit grouping
Syria, Jordan, the Palestinian National Authority and Egypt to
work out a strategy parallel to an Israeli initiative to promote
peace.
</P>
<P>
Israel's go-ahead on the construction of 6,500 housing units
for Jewish settlers in East Jerusalem last month triggered
Arab and world anger and brought the peace process to a
sudden halt.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's last visit to Kuwait was on May 10, 1993.

<HEADLINE> Toilet/Greenhouse Comes More Sanitary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Hou Deying, a farmer in
northeast China's Liaoning Province, has built a toilet in his
greenhouse to create a multi-purpose recycling system.
</P>
<P>
On the left side of the greenhouse, Hou planted some green
vegetables. Over to the right, he built a toilet alongside his
pigpens. Beneath the toilet and pens is a methane-generating pit,
where the manure of both men and animals can ferment and emit gas
to be used for lighting and cooking in his house.
</P>
<P>
And what's left in the bottom of the pit is good fertilizer for
his vegetables, Hou said.
</P>
<P>
More than 400,000 people in 112,000 rural households in the
province have begun to use the new-style toilets, rather than the
former versions which were simply a pit, two bricks to stand on
and corn stalks for walls.
</P>
<P>
The new toilets are far more sanitary than their predecessors,
said officials with the provincial committee of Patriotic Hygiene
Movement.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted in recent years shows that the incidence
rate of infectious intestinal disease is 28 percent lower among
farmers who use the new toilets than those who prefer the old ones.
</P>
<P>
The local governments have also recommended another five types
of sanitary toilets to farmers, with a plan that 40 percent of the
rural households will use sanitary toilets by the end of the year
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
New houses without sanitary toilets will not be allowed to be
built in rural areas, while in some areas, such as Jinzhou city,
the governments will provide farmers with construction material
for new toilets.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Industry and Trade
Minister Yalim Erez resigned here today soon after Health
Minister Yildirim Aktuna announced his resignation as the
coalition government of pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) and
center-right True Path Party (DYP) is approaching the verge of
collapse.
</P>
<P>
After submitting the letter of his resignation to pro-Islamic
Welfare Party (RP) leader and Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan,
Erez, a DYP member, told the press that the government is under
threat and his resignation serves his duty to the nation and to
his party.
</P>
<P>
Before his resignation, Aktuna, also a DYP member, said
that he had seen that the 54th government led by Erbakan
destroy the the basic quality of the Constitution of Turkey,
adding that for this reason, he could no longer work as cabinet
member in the government.
</P>
<P>
A dozen of DYP deputies in the parliament have urged the DYP
withdrawal from the government led by Erbakan as the RP is
opposing secularism advocated by Mustafa Kemal, founder of
the Republic of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
According to local newspaper Daily News Friday, a poll of
1,557 voters conducted in large cities showed that 72.3 percent
of the participants wanted an end to the RP-DYP government and
60.5 percent saw anti-secular activities as a greater threat to
the country than the illegal Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Turkey's National Security Council, the highest decision-making
body of national defense, is now holding a meeting at the
presidential palace under the chairmanship of President Suleyman
Demirel to decide the destiny of the coalition government.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 26 (Xinhua) -- French Frigate "George
Leygues" arrived here today to take part in a multi-national
exercise with Kuwaiti, U.S. and British vessels, according to the
French Embassy in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The embassy issued a press release saying that the ship would
also be here for a five-day normal call at Kuwait's Shuwaikh port.
</P>
<P>
It added that the French frigate "is pleased to come to
Kuwait to reinforce the good relationship between the French
navy and the Kuwaiti navy."
</P>
<P>
During the visit, captain of the ship Jean-Pierre Miquel will
meet with Kuwaiti civilian and military officials on board,

Britain and France after the Gulf War in 1991 when the
U.S.-led allied forces liberated Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation,
Kuwaiti official sources said.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first such war games to be conducted by
the four countries in the Gulf since the start of this
year.

<HEADLINE> Police Head Calls for Intensified Efforts in Crime Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, April (Xinhua) -- The head of China's police force has
called for public security bodies nationwide to intensify crime
prevention efforts and bring the country's crime rate down further.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Public Security Tao Siju issued the order at a
recent national conference here on the work of police substations.
</P>
<P>
"Curbing crime and improving public order has always been one
of the major political issues of great concern to the Central
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party," Tao stated in his
speech.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that police organizations take effective measures
appropriate to their localities in their fight against crime.
</P>
<P>
All grassroots police substations should devote themselves to
building their community safety network and beefing up efforts in
preventing robberies in urban areas, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Control over migrant rural laborers in cities, houses to rent
and places linking rural and urban areas must be reinforced, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Places which easily induce and create crime must be wiped
out," Tao said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that more work should be done to educate
minors and reduce the rate of juvenile delinquency.
</P>
<P>
After a year of its "strike hard" campaign against crime, China
witnessed an unprecedented five percent drop in its crime rate in
1996.

<HEADLINE> UN Asked to Stop US Intervention in Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Has accused the United
States of deliberately hampering the approval of food and
medicine contracts it signed with foreign companies in line with
U.N. resolutions, the Iraqi News Agency ( INA) reported
here today.
</P>
<P>
In an letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Friday, Iraqi
Foreign Minister Mohammed Sa'eed Al-Sahaf called on Annan to stop
U.S. intervention and speed up the approval process.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that over the past few days, the U.S. has been
"purposefully and unjustifiably" holding up the ratification of
l50 contracts, including 40 medicine contracts, signed by Iraq
and foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
On April 21, 22 and 23, the secretariat of the U.N. Sanctions
Committee informed Iraq's permanent U.N. mission in New York that
the U.S. was withholding the approval of 40 medicine contracts,
according to INA.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahaf drew Annan's attention to the fact that should the
delays persist, the oil-for-food memo reached last May by Iraq
and U.N. would not be implemented as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister held the U.S. government "fully
responsible for the deliberate delays" in implementing the memo.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. held many contracts submitted to the
U.N. Sanctions Committee with "groundless and unjustifiable"
objections, which suggests that the U.S. government is using the
committee as a "tool" to carry out its own "reckless policy"
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
INA said that the U.N. chief was in favor of taking
"appropriate measures" to ensure smooth delivery of goods to
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to consider an Iraqi proposal on increasing
from three to five or six the number of experts entrusted with
reviewing the contracts.
</P>
<P>
Iraq complained that it has submitted several hundred medicine
contracts, but only a few of them were approved by the Sanctions
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Foodstuffs bought under the memo have started piling up in
Iraq since last month, but no medicine has arrived yet. The memo
allows Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil for food
and medicine badly needed in the country over six months.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N.-imposed sanctions since it invaded
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The world Health Organization (WHO ) said in February that
Iraq's health system was close to collapse and urged the
Sanctions Committee to speed up the approval process to facilitate
medical supplies.

BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A new labor and personnel system

<HEADLINE> Turkish Minister Resignation Threatens Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Health Minister Yildirim
Aktuna resigned here today, showing growing speculation that the
coalition government by pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) and
center-right True Path Party (DYP) is on the verge of breaking
up.
</P>
<P>
Aktuna submitted the letter of his resignation to RP leader
and Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, saying that the 54th
government led by Erbakan were detrimental to the Republic of
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Aktuna, a DYP member, said that he had seen that the government
destroys the basic quality of the Constitution of Turkey, adding
that for this reason, he can not work as cabinet member in the
government any more.
</P>
<P>
According to informed sources here, the Industrial and Trade
minister Yalim Erez, also a DYP member, is to tender his
resignation later, creating more presure on the government.
</P>
<P>
A dozen of DYP deputies in the parliament have urged DYP
withdrawal from the government led by Erbakan as the RP is
opposing secularism advocated by Mustafa Kemal, the founder of
the Republic of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Ankara Esenboga Airport on his return from a visit
abroad Friday, Chief of General Staff Ismail Hakki Karadayi said that
there are some sensitive developments happening in Turkey which
create disturbance in the public as well as in the Turkish
military and "no one can remain silent about those developments."
</P>
<P>
Karadayi made remarks amid speculations that the Islamist-led
coalition government would be asked to tender its resignation at
today's National Security Council (NSC) meeting.
</P>
<P>
The council, highest decision-making body of national defense,
is led by president Suleyman Demirel and comprises members from
the military chiefs and civilian leaders. In its last meeting in
February, recommendations were made to the government to curb the
increasing fundamentalist activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government, formed on June 28, 1996, won a vote
of confidence in parliament on July 8, 1996. But the government
received its first heavy blow with the NSC meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to local newspaper Daily News Friday, a poll of
1,557 voters conducted in big cities, showed that 72.3 percent of
the participants wanted an end to the RP-DYP government and 60.5
percent see anti-secular activities as a greater threat than the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).

<P>
SHENZHEN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The working group on the rules

Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) discussed the PLC
committee structure here today.
</P>
<P>
A number of committees will operate in parallel under the PLC,
said Selina Chow, convener of the 12-member ad hoc team on the
rules of procedure, who hosted a closed-door meeting on committee
structure today in Shenzhen, the Chinese city bordering Hong Kong.
</P>

committees, such as a Members' Interest Committee, a Bill
Committee and a Panels Committee, are on the drawing board.

At a news briefing after the group meeting, Chow said the Bill
Committee and the Panels Committee are expected to report first to
the already established House Committee, which is made up of all
the 59 PLC members except President Rita Fan.

"It is appropriate for the Bill Committee and the Panels
Committee to report first to the House Committee, which plays the

<HEADLINE> Macao Photo Show Marks Declaration Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 pictures on events
around the singing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration were
put on display here today as part of the activities to mark the
10th anniversary of the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
They depict the historical background, the process of
negotiations between governments of the two countries and the
grand signing ceremony, with the one showing Deng Xiaoping shaking
hands with the Portuguese premier topping all.
</P>
<P>
Signed on April 13, 1987, the joint declaration stipulates that
China will resume its exercise of sovereignty over Macao as of
December 20, 1999, and that Macao's capitalist system and basic
lifestyle will remain unchanged for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
A series of activities have been launched this month to
commemorate the 10th anniversary of the historic document. Chinese
officials stationed in Macao and Macao celebrities have again
praised the document as "a model for the whole world in handling
disputes left over from the past between different nations."
</P>
<P>
Aside from those about the signing of the declaration, the
photos on display also show the changes brought about by the joint
declaration over the past 10 years. Newspapers, books and models
of the theme are also part of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
The photo exhibition, jointly sponsored by the Macao Basic Law
Promotion Association, the Macao Association of the Press and the
Macao Foundation, will last until next Monday. Officials of both
China and Portugal attended today's opening ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Respiratory Disease Expert Calls For Active Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A noted Chinese scientist is
urging that greater attention should be paid to research and
prevention of respiratory disease -- the number one cause of death
in China.
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't underestimate the danger posed to people's health
by respiratory disease," said Prof. Weng Xinzhi of the Beijing
Respiratory Disease Research Center, adding that research of
disease control should be expanded and anti-smoking efforts
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
"Research institutes for respiratory diseases should be set up
gradually in all provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities," the Beijing-based "Health News" quoted Prof. Weng
as telling a recent symposium on respiratory disease.
</P>
<P>
Weng's research center will be upgraded within the year into
China's first province-level research institute for respiratory
illness, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas of China, where 900 million people live, chronic
respiratory ailments remain the major health killer. They are the
third most common cause of death among urban Chinese, after
cardiovascular disease and cancer.
</P>
<P>
Lung cancer has become the deadliest cancer in Chinese cities,
killing about 35 out of every 100,000 people in 1994, compared
with 29 people per every 100,000 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Weng blamed rapid rises of both incidence and mortality
rate of lung cancer and chronic lung disease on smoking, the
deterioration of the environment and the public's ignorance about
the diseases.

<HEADLINE> Circular Issued on Tax Reduction, Exemption for Poor Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration of
Taxation has issued a circular that requires tax departments in
China to ensure tax reduction or exemption for poor farmers.
</P>
<P>
The circular urges tax departments to strictly follow state
policies on reduction or exemption of agricultural taxes and those
for farming specialities.
</P>
<P>
It requires the departments to more closely review the
distribution of the poverty-stricken population in their areas, to
make sure that all those farmers eligible for the cuts or
exemptions receive them.
</P>
<P>
Due to differences in incomes of farmers in poor areas, the
departments should implement tax changes in line with the actual
conditions of the taxpayers, says the circular.
</P>
<P>
It stipulates that farmers without enough to eat and wear
should apply to local taxation departments for tax reduction or
exemption, and the departments in turn should verify the
information on the applications before sending them to county
governments for approval.
</P>
<P>
The taxpayers should be notified as to whether their
applications have been approved before the date for tax
collection, approved tax rebates should be given back to each
individual taxpayer, and no unit or individual should for any
reason divert the money for other use, the circular stresses.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows 1.07 Million Nigerians Blind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- At least one of every 100 Nigerians is
blind, which means a blind population of 1.07 million or 1.2 percent
of the country's 1991 national population census, according to a
recent study.
</P>
<P>
The 1991 census, whose final result was made known at the end of
February this year, puts Nigeria's total population at 88,992,220,
including 44,529,608 males and 44,462,612 females.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Committee for the Prevention of Blindness
(NCPB), an estimated 200,000 more Nigerians become blind yearly, and
three million others have impaired sight which are not good enough to
be engaged in productive employment.
</P>
<P>
Many Nigerians are already blind from cataract causes while an
additional 100,000 become blind from the same cause each year, said
A.O. Mahamoud, NCPB's secretary and coordinator.
</P>
<P>
NCPB is an organ of the Federal Ministry of Health for overseeing
all issues of prevention of blindness in the country. Its long-term
objective is to reduce the prevalence of blindness in all states in
the country to 0.5 percent or one percent in any one community by the
year 2000.

<HEADLINE> China To Beef up Financial Supervision: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China will eliminate illegally
operating financial institutions in a bid to step up financial
supervision and reduce financial risks, a senior central bank
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"To beef up financial supervision and cut financial risks is a
focal point of our financial work in the Ninth Five-Year Plan
period (1996-2000), especially for this year," Shang Fulin, deputy
governor of the People's Bank of China, said at an international
seminar on China's economic reform and its liberalization of the
accounting market.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to follow a moderately tight monetary
policy, increase financial supervision, standardize the financial
order, cut financial risks and improve the operation of its
financial institutions, Shang said of China's effort to reform and
develop its financial sector in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
"To step up financial supervision and reduce financial risks,
we must resolutely and completely eradicate all illegal financial
institutions, prevent bank funds from entering the stock market,
continue to investigate financial rule violations and unlawful
fund accounts, strengthen the management of cash, and take
measures to stop the increase in bad loans," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official also said that China will accelerate the
construction of basic facilities for enhancing financial
supervision and institute a more developed legal system for
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
A personal responsibility system and an electronic information
system will be established to improve supervision, according to
Shang, who also said that the qualifications of senior financial
management personnel will be closely examined.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a moderately tight monetary policy calls for an
effective control on the money supply, a shift to indirect
financial regulation leverages, and increased financial
supervision.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should also be made to improve the efficiency and
management of the state-owned commercial banks and to standardize
the development of other banks and non-banking financial
institutions, the official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Regional banks should be developed and the construction of 100
urban cooperative banks should be accelerated, he said, adding
that rural cooperative banks should be set up on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
Shang also said that the central bank will take measures to
maintain and increase the value of the country's huge foreign
exchange reserves, which were at 105 billion US dollars at the end
of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Management and supervision over capital inflow and outflow and
over foreign debt will be stepped up, he told the participants of
the two-day seminar, which was co-sponsored by the Chinese
Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Hong Kong
Society of Accountants.

<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The murder of a 40-year-old Indian man by four Brazilian
youths from "good families" in Brasilia has aroused a wave of
protest in Brazil. Galdino Jesus dos Santos, who is one of the
300 survivors of the Pataxo Indian tribe, was burnt alive on

"scare away a beggar by burning his feet."

Zaire, while Kabila only agrees to go to South Africa or Zambia
for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The refusal by the first secretary of the French Socialist
Party Lionel Jospin to join a four-party television debate with
Prime Minister Alain Juppe has triggered criticism from the ruling
majority, which accuses Jospin of "fleeing the debate" during the
campaign for the legislative elections by all political parties.
</P>
<P>
-- According to a poll made in Britain, 66 percent of the
British citizens hope that the monarchy will stay, while 34

HANOI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese authorities have ensured
that all returnees are given amnesty for their illegal departure,
the Vietnam News today quoted an official of the United Nations
High Commissioners for Refugees (UNHCR) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Assistance high commissioner Sergio Vieira de Mello said,
"there were no instances of persecution of returnees reported by
UNHCR monitoring teams, demonstrating that Vietnam fully adhered
to the commitments provided in a memorandum of understanding it
signed with the UNHCR in 1988."
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR representative believed that the saga of Vietnamese
boat people, one of the most tragic examples of human suffering in
the region's recent history, was finally coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of some 2,600 persons in Hong Kong were
expected to return to Vietnam in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
According to Vietnam News, Vietnam wants to try and repatriate
the last Vietnamese boat people from Hong Kong by the end of next
month. But it is concerned that the identification screening
process will be too slow if it does not receive due support from
Hong Kong authorities.
</P>
<P>
A number of people, when they left the country, gave false
names and addresses, which will make it impossible to repatriate
them to their villages of origin, as stipulated in the 1988
memorandum of understanding.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, a total of 109,199 screened-out Vietnamese boat
people, who had been determined to be illegal migrants and not
refugees, have returned to Vietnam from camps or detention centers
in ASEAN countries, Hong Kong and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR has spent some 59 million U.S. dollars in Vietnam to
facilitate the reception and reintegration of returnees within the
comprehensive plan of action for Indo-Chinese refugees, the
Voluntary Repatriation Program, and the Orderly Return Program.
</P>
<P>
Of the money, 33 million U.S. dollars was distributed to the
returnees as a reintegration cash grant, and 11.5 million
U.S. dollars spent on construction or repair of schools,
dispensaries, bridges and roads for the communities receiving
returnees.

<HEADLINE> PNA Hails Strong UN Move on Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian delegate to the United
Nations Nasser Qidwa today hailed the resolution just adopted by
U.N. General Assembly as a very strong reaction to the Israeli
settlement operations.
</P>
<P>
"It is one of the strongest resolutions by the General Assembly
demanding an immediate halt to Israel's construction of a new
settlement in East Jerusalem," Qidwa told the Egyptian Voice of
Arab radio on telephone.
</P>
<P>
The resolution passed in an overwhelming vote of 134-3, with 11
abstention, at an emergency special session Thursday, urged an end
to all forms of assistance and support for illegal Israeli
activities in the occupied territories, particularly settlement
activities.
</P>
<P>
Qidwa said that the resolution also called for setting up a
mechanism to report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan within
two months the latest developments in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The resolution reiterated that the 185-member General
Assembly, if necessary, may meet once again on the Israeli
settlement activities," Qidwa added.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the Arab states to move effectively if Israel
insisted on going ahead with "political confrontation."
</P>
<P>
Qidwa thanked the Arab and non-aligned states for backing the
Palestinian cause and their hard-pushing to convene such an
emergency meeting after the U.S. vetoed twice the Security Council
draft resolutions denouncing Israel's settlement construction.
</P>
<P>
The resolution of the General Assembly, approved despite
negative votes from the U.S., Israel and Micronesia, demanded
"immediate and full cessation of the construction... and of all
other Israeli settlement activities."
</P>
<P>
Israel began the Har Homa construction on March 18, despite
strong Palestinian protests and international pressure. The peace
process has since grounded to a halt, leading to violent clashes
between stone-throwing Palestinian protesters and Israeli soldiers
across the Palestinian territories.

<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Up to 100 forest and grassland
fires have occurred in Mongolia so far this spring, with six of
them still raging.
</P>
<P>
The country's civil defense committee reported today that of
the six raging fires, two are in the northern province of Hovsgol,
three in the northeastern province of Hentii and one in the
north-central province of Arhangai.
</P>
<P>
The committee said the fires in the eastern province bordering
China have been put off.
</P>
<P>
Forest and grassland fires have been reported in 11 provinces,
covering over three million hectares of land. Most of the fires
were caused by residents' carelessness.
</P>
<P>
Spring is a fire-prone season in the country. Last spring,
forest and grassland fires raged on an unprecedented scale,
affecting 16 of the country's 21 provinces. A total of 10.5
million hectares of forests and grassland were destroyed,
resulting in a combined ecological and economic loss of about two
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> US Asked to Open Markets for African Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 26 (Xinhua) -- African countries have asked
the United States to open its markets for products from Africa.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here on Friday, Minister for
Industries and Trade William Shija said African countries had
plenty to offer to American markets.
</P>
<P>
He said the current American policy on importation does not give
prominence to African goods.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that a recent meeting of Southern African
Development Community (SADC) ministers of trade and industries with
the American leadership has helped to iron out some bottle-neckes in
the trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held between April 17 to 19 this year. It was
attended by US Secretary of Trade William Daley and
representatives from Angola, Botswana, Malawi, South Africa,
Swaziland, Zambia, Lesotho, Mauritius, Zimbabwe, Tanzania,
Namibia and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the meeting also discussed various areas which the
SADC countries could exploit in revamping trade links with the US.
</P>
<P>
While in the US, Minister Shija attended a meeting on African
economic situation and the place of American private sector investment
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held in Chattil of the US between April 20 and
22, was sponsored by the Washington based "the Corporate Council on
African".
</P>
<P>
The minister said the African leaders had time to share
experiences with their American counterparts and assured them of
conducive business climate.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by President Joachim Chissano of
Mozambique, South African Vice-President Thabo Mbeki, Ugandan Prime
Minister Kintu Musoke.

<HEADLINE> Bank Robberies Beat Hijacking, Housebreaking in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Hijackings and housebreaking in
Gauteng Province have fallen off significantly this year as bank
robberies skyrocket, the local daily Saturday Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
In Johannesburg, a large commercial city in the province, violent
robberies in homes had dropped 12.4 percent in the first three months
of this year compared with the same period in 1996 -- and by 22 percent
in March alone while car hijackings decreased six percent.
</P>
<P>
But there has been an unprecedented spate of bank robberies in
Gauteng Province, with 48 cases since January, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A task force has been set up to trace the bank
robbers operating in this province, a police source was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Since the task force was formed on March 13, it has arrested 21
suspects, many of them for multiple robberies and murder. One of the
suspects is believed to be a policeman, the source said, adding that a
large number of robbers were illegal immigrants. enditem

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Draft Budget Sees 10.56 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti 1997-98 fiscal
year draft budget recently approved by the government projects
revenues at 3.2 billion Kuwait dinars (10.56 billion
U.S. dollars), a government report said today.
</P>
<P>
The report said, the revenue is about 200 million dinars (about
660 million dollars) higher than that estimated in the current year.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget envisages a 25 percent drop in military
spending, the first time Kuwait expects to cut military
expenditure since the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait had decided to spend 12 billion U.S. dollars in military
reconstruction in a period of 10 years after the war.
</P>
<P>
The budget did not give specific figures of the military
expenditure, believed to be major item in the budget.
</P>
<P>
The report put oil revenues, which accounts for more than 80
percent of the state income, for 1997-98 fiscal year starting July
1 at 2.555 billion dinars (84.32 billion U.S. dollars), just 3
million dinars (about 9.9 million dollars) less then estimates in
the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti government adopts oil prices at 13 U.S. dollars a
barrel as the basis for calculating revenues. Kuwait, sits on
about 10 percent of the world proven oil reserves, exports
about 2 million barrels of crude oil daily.
</P>
<P>
The budget also proposed to increase non-oil revenues by
more than 40 percent during the coming fiscal year, generating
as much as 645 million dinars (2.128 billion U.S. dollars)
from non-oil sources, mainly increase and imposition of charges
and fees on public services.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil revenues in the current fiscal year, which ends
June 30, are estimated at 442 million dinars (1.459 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Two month ago, Kuwaiti Cabinet approved a draft law calling
on the National Assembly to allow ministries to impose new
charges and increase the existing ones on public services. The
parliament is expected to discuss the proposal with the draft
budget, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The 1997-98 draft budget also projects expenditures to reach
4.37 billion dinars (14.42 billion U.S. dollars), 160 million
dinars (528 million U.S. dollars) higher than estimates in the
current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit is projected at 1.169 billion dinars
(3.86 billion U.S. dollars), just 40 million dinars (132
million U.S. dollars) less than estimates this year.
</P>
<P>
But the gross budget deficit is projected to reach 1.49
billion dinars (4.92 billion U.S. dollars) after deduction of
10 percent of overall revenues to be added to the Reserve
Fund for Future Generations earmarked for the post-oil age
funds, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The deduction is normally added to the budget deficit in
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The budget needs the endorsement of the parliament to
become a law.

countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the five nations, China, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan, will reduce their military
forces in the border areas.
</P>
<P>
The accord was a unique document for the five countries, for
the Asia-Pacific region and even for the whole world, Kazakh
Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev said.
</P>
<P>
The Panorama weekly today quoted the minister as saying that
the agreement ruled out the possibility of military conflicts in
the border areas.
</P>

"The agreement is of political significance to Kazakhstan in
terms of national security," Tokayev said.
</P>

confidence-building in border areas signed by the five presidents
in Shanghai, China, last year.

more than 7,000 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 27 in Hotel Fire in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-seven people, including
seven Philippine government employees, were killed, and 10 others
injured in a big fire which razed down a hotel in the Southern
Philippine city of Cotabato at dawn today, the Philippine News
Agency said this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In its earlier report, the agency said that at least seven
people were killed in the Imperial Hotel fire but the fate of the
seven employees of the Department of Agriculture was unknown.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the fire of still unknown origin gutted
the upper three floors of the six-story hotel around 1 a.m. (17:00
GMT Friday), killing at least 27 of the establishment's occupants
and wounding 10 others.
</P>
<P>
Firemen were able to contain the fire by 4 a.m., it said.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that as of mid-afternoon today, only 19 of the
27 victims have been identified by authorities as all the victims
were charred beyond recognition.

The seven government employees were in the city to evaluate a
project and they were checked in at Rooms 414 and 417 when the
fire broke out, it said.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted firemen as saying that the seven failed to
come out of their rooms as they were suffocated by the thick smoke
caused by the fire.
</P>
<P>
Inspector Edsrafil Dilawangan described the fire incident as
the worst in the history of the city.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that the fire damage was pegged at some 30

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Religious leader Condemns Algerian Slaughters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese Muslim religious leader
has denounced recent massacres in Algeria in which more than 150
civilians were slaughtered, saying that the events "have nothing to
do with Islam."
</P>
<P>
Sunni Mufty Mohammed Rashid Qabbani was quoted by the Lebanese
newspaper Daily Star as saying that the slaughters "should be
ascribed to individuals, not to Islam."
</P>
<P>
More than 60,000 people have been killed since Islamic
extremists rebelled against the Algerian government in 1992.
</P>
<P>
He called on Arabs and Muslims to put an end to the bloodshed
in Algeria and prevent its negative effects on Islam's "tolerant
message."
</P>
<P>
Qabbani's comments came at the end of a bloody week in Algeria
which culminated in the bombing of a train Friday killing at least
21 people.
</P>
<P>
In the week's first massacre, which took place Tuesday in a
village only 25 kilometers south of Algiers, 93 people were hacked
to death, the highest death toll in single raid in more than five
years.
</P>
<P>
Some 42 people were killed in another raid on Omaria village
some 50 kilometers south of the capital only 24 hours
later.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Women Oppose Polygamy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A traditional association of the Tonga
people in southern Zambia is campaigning against polygamy.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the Southern Province Tonga Traditional
Association, Dickson Namanza, said the association is urging women to
shun married men.
</P>
<P>
Africa Information Afrique quoted Namanza as saying that "we want
to promote the 'one man one women' motto in our country as we believe
that this will go a long way towards helping to reduce the nummbers of
HIV and AIDS cases as it will encourage the development of a
monogamous society."
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the men in the province have more than one wife
and it is feared that the practice leads to the spread of HIV and
AIDS. Nationally 18 percent of marriages are polygamous.
</P>
<P>
Of the total population of nine million in Zambia, two million are
the Tonga. Tonga men usually marry more than one wife to get help in
cultivating fields as well as looking after large herds of cattle.
</P>
<P>
The campaign has the support of traditional leaders. Headman
Simalumba said "most of us traditional rulers or leaders are advising
our people to stick to one partner and not to go into polygamy because
by doing so they increase the risk of contracting HIV and AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
Women rights activists in the country have come out in support of
the campaign. Former National Women Lobby Group Chairwoman, Gladys
Mutukwa said "if women say no to married men, polygamy will die a
natural death in Zambia."
</P>
<P>
She said Zambian women have been brainwashed into thinking that
their identity lies in being allied to a man. "Some women are linking
up with married men just because they are afraid of remaining single."
</P>
<P>
Edwidge Mutale, of the gender and development division social
action group in Lusaka, blamed the Zambian society for putting too
great an emphasis on marriage. She said society does not respect
single women, thus forcing women to go even for men who
already have wivies.
</P>
<P>
Some women are deceived into polygamous marriages by married men
who pretend to be single, according Africa Information Afrique.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rejects UN Resolution on Har Homa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy rejected the United Nations General Assembly's resolution
that demanded Israel to halt immediately the Har Homa Jewish
settlement construction in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was passed by the Assembly in a overwhelming
vote of 134-3, with 11 abstentions after two-day debate. It
demanded that Israel halt the Har Homa construction and called
for suspension of any assistance to Israel's settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
In his response, Levy was quoted by Israel Radio as saying that
Israel would not accept such resolution which would not advance
the peace process. He stressed that the differences between Israel
and the Palestinian National Authority should only be resolved by
direct negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Levy added that there was no justification of the U.N.'s
debate on Har Homa issue while the international agenda was
laid with many more serious problems that required its
attention.
</P>
<P>
This is the second resolution passed by the Assembly demanding
Israel to halt the Har Homa project, which caused the current
deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
The United States vetoed two U.N. Security Council resolution
drafts which demanded Israel to stop the Har Homa construction,
insisting that the issue should be only resolved through
Israeli-Palestinian direct negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israel began the Har Homa construction on March 18, despite
strong Palestinian protests and international pressure. The peace
process has since grounded to a halt, leading to violent clashes
between stone-throwing Palestinian protesters and Israeli
soldiers across the Palestinian territories.

<HEADLINE> Special Fish Pond --"Greenhouse" In Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli farmers have developed
a "greenhouse" covering for fish breeding ponds designed to
substantially cut the time and cost of pond construction.
</P>
<P>
According to the Israel Export Institute, a farm using this
system and producing 200 tonnes a year of Tilapia, has been
operating for over a year at Kibbutz Gonen in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
The greenhouse, similar in appearance to a circus tent, consists
of a UV-protected, pre-stressed PVC cover anchored by cables to
the walls and supported by a central pole in the middle of the pond.
</P>
<P>
The pole too, is supported by guy wires. The greenhouse
helps retain heat at night. To release heat during the day, the
top can be opened and the sides rolled up. The ponds (optimal
size 550 square meters) are made of prefabricated, pre-stressed
concrete panels, and designed to withstand winds of up to 140
kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
The bottom and walls are lined with reinforced Atim Elva, a
special pond liner. Erection of a greenhouse takes only one day
and since the central pole is the only metal part in the
construction, the greenhouse is highly price competitive, as well
as being suitable for sea-water fish ponds.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Import More Sugar in 1996-97 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Sugar and Food
Industries Corporation plans to import 250,000 tons of sugar to
meet the country's requirement and to keep the sugar price stable
on the market.
</P>
<P>
With the sugar production in the 1996-97 crushing season fell
by 70,000 tons against the target due to non-availability of
required sugarcane for mills, an increased quantity of sugar will
be imported by July this year, related sources said.
</P>
<P>
During the previous fiscal year from July 1, 1995 to June 30,
1996, about 120,000 tons of sugar was imported by this
corporation.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the total production of Bangladesh's
15 sugar mills this year was targeted at 215,000 tons while the
production was only recorded at 135,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bangladesh requires about 350,000 tons of sugar per
year and the deficit has to be covered through import of sugar,
the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Nissan Insurance Ordered to Suspend Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Finance Ministry
ordered the Nissan Mutual Life Insurance Co. on Friday to shut
down its operations in the face of Japan's first insurance
bankruptcy in five decades, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's suspension order came after the insurance
company, Japan's 16th largest with a work force of 4,700 people,
suffered snowballing debts. Nissan was forced to seek the
cooperation of other insurance companies to take over its millions
of insurance contracts.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that such an order has been given to a
life insurance company, indicating a fiercer survival competition
among Japan's financial institutions before the "Big Bang" of a
financial system deregulation.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka reportedly stressed
that all efforts would be made to protect Nissan Mutual
policy-holders.
</P>
<P>
Mitsuzuka said the main reason for the insurer's fall was its
failures in asset investment.
</P>
<P>
A plan to protect Nissan's policy-holders would be introduced
in accordance with the insurance sector's special fund designed to
deal with such problems.
</P>
<P>
Under the rescue plan, the Finance Ministry would provide up to
200 billion yen (about 1.6 billion dollars) to insurance companies
that take over insurance contracts from a folding insurer. The
program has never been used since it was introduced in April 1996
under Japan's New Insurance Business Law.

<HEADLINE> Siemens to Double Investment in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- German conglomerate Siemens Ag
has invested 700 million German Marks (408 million US dollars) in
China and plans to double that amount by 2001, reported today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The 408 million US dollars has gone toward creating three
wholly owned companies, 35 joint ventures and 10 representative
offices in China, Siemens Ltd China President Hermann Koelle said.
</P>
<P>
He envisaged by 2000, business volume in China will account for
more than half of Siemens' total sales in the Asia Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
More joint ventures are planned including one in Zhuzhou, Hunan
Province, producing locomotives for high-speed trains and another
in Deyang, Sichuan Province, making generating units for
coal-fired power plants, Koelle said.
</P>
<P>
Siemens has recently signed a contract to supply 40 three-phase
locomotives with the Chinese Ministry of Railways and part of the
order will be placed with the Zhuzhou venture now under
feasibility study.
</P>
<P>
The locomotive, employing state-of-the-art technology and in
service in many European countries, boasts an average speed of 120
kilometers per hour for freight trains and 200 kilometers per hour
for passengers and can convert brake force into electricity.
</P>
<P>

per hour and with its Eurotrain technology, cut the time needed
for the 1,300-kilometer rail ride between Beijing and Shanghai
from 17 hours to less than seven.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of Crude
palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week mixed.
</P>
<P>
This week the CPO physicals market extended its firm
performance after it breached through the 1,300 ringgit (about 520
U.S. dollars) level in early April.
</P>
<P>
The April South was traded at 1,352.50 ringgit (about 541
dollars) per ton compared with 1,325 ringgit (about 530 dollars)
last week.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals are anticipated to continue trending upward
on interest for May shipment, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The bullish export estimates for the April 1-25 period by a
cargo surveyor is expected to spur buying sentiment and strengthen
the cash market.
</P>
<P>
Societe Generale de Surveillance (M) Sdn Bhd (SGS) estimated
exports for April 1-25 at 549,976 tons compared with 501,908 tons
for March 1-25.
</P>
<P>
However, the uncertainty on the Kuala Lumpur Commodity
Exchange's direction next week, is expected to limit gains.
</P>
<P>
This week, the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) started on a
bullish note as buyers covered their positions after a long
holiday due to the Aidil Adha celebrations coupled with the firm
ringgit.
</P>
<P>
However, tin was pressured towards late week trading following
the softer London Metal Exchange (LME) and the unfavorable ringgit
in the local front.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the week, tin closed lower at 14.08 ringgit per
kg but was higher three sen against the previous Thursday of 14.05
ringgit.
</P>
<P>
Turnover rose to 498 tons from 443 tons as Japanese buyers, who
were absent last week, added to the European and local buyers in
bulk of the transactions.
</P>
<P>
The premium between the KLTM and of the LME broadened to 65
dollars per ton from 60 dollars per ton previously.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated strong ringgit on the foreign exchange next
week is expected to spur interest on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market
(KLTM).
</P>
<P>
A dealer said if the local unit's performance improved on the
forex, players are most likely to favor the metal as it is
relatively cheap.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Malaysian rubber market which was idle last week
closed the week lower with May RSS One ending the week 10 sen
lower to 277.50 sen (about 111 U.S. cents) per kg from 287.50 sen
(about 115 U.S. cents) per kg last week, and SMR 20 slipping seven
sen to 263.50 sen (about 105.4 U.S. cents) per kg from 270.50 sen
(about 108 U.S. cents) per kg last week.
</P>
<P>
The local rubber market is anticipated to continue its
downtrend next week as major consumers sideline themselves
awaiting better prices, a Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing
Board (MRELB) official said.
</P>
<P>
He said the market was lacking fundamentals to support prices,
while consumers were well-stocked.
</P>
<P>
The official said bargain hunting was expected to depress
rubber prices further as consumers have easy access to the
commodity and thus were waiting for cheaper prices from producing
countries.

<HEADLINE> Inspections Stabilize Firms' Product Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Quality of products manufactured
by large Chinese enterprises remains stable, with the standard
rate of sample products inspected in the first quarter hitting
93.1 percent, according to a report in today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The gap between large enterprises and medium-sized ones in
product quality is being narrowed, the newspaper quoted an
official in charge of quality inspection under the State Bureau of
Technical Supervision (SBTS) as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The smaller enterprises are giving more attention to quality
control by establishing serial quality examination systems and
introducing advanced foreign technology," the official, Xuan
Xiang, announced at a news conference Friday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said the standard rate of sample products taken from
medium-sized factories reached 89.1 percent, while the rate from
small factories was only 68.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter this year, technical inspectors checked a
total of 1,742 kinds of products made by 1,343 manufacturers and
the average standard rate reached 79.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a step to improve the effectiveness of official supervision
and promote quality control, more than 20 managers of state-owned
factories have been dismissed from their posts for failure in
producing standard products, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
China introduced the quarterly product quality inspection 11
years ago and the inspection has become a main means of
supervision and administration of the country's product quality by
the government.
</P>
<P>
The inspection covers important industrial and consumer goods
closely related to people's health and the safety of goods.

<HEADLINE> Nutrition Experts Issue Health Guidelines For Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese nutrition experts have
urged their countrymen to take milk and bean food daily and do
physical exercise in order to build a strong physique.
</P>
<P>
They issued healthy-eating guidelines Friday in Beijing,
attempting to provide a reference tool for citizens preparing
meals, as well as for governments preparing agricultural
production and food processing, according to a report in today's
"China Daily".
</P>
<P>
They come in response to the United Nations' call for an
improvement in global nutrition and may play a part in making
Chinese residents live longer and healthier, the newspaper quoted
Ge Keyou, council director of the Chinese Nutriology Society, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines advise all Chinese citizens above two years to
drink milk and eat bean food daily, try a greater variety of grain
food, eat more vegetables, fruits as well as eggs, fish and lean
meat.
</P>
<P>
People should take moderate physical exercise to prevent
becoming overweight and reduce the incidence of chronic illnesses,
the guidelines suggested, adding that greater importance should be
attached to food hygiene, avoiding infectious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines were developed by the Nutrition and Food Hygiene
Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicines
and the Chinese Nutriology Society, with support from the Ministry
of Public Health, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Data from the ministry indicate that most Chinese have enough
to eat, but malnutrition still exists, it said.
</P>
<P>
Some children suffered from malnutrition-related ailments, such
as rickets and anemia, which could impair their physical health
and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
The malnutrition rate for adults is nine percent in cities and
eight percent in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Overweight adults increased from almost 10 to 15 percent in
rural areas during the 1982-1992 period.
</P>
<P>
Chronic diseases resulting from improper diets have become a
major cause of death in the country. Some 13,000 people die of
such ailments amounting to 70 percent of the death toll annually.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Health has scheduled massive publicity
drives to get Chinese informed of the guidelines and encourage
them to eat accordingly, the newspaper quoted Kan Xuegui,
department director in charge of health supervision in the
ministry, as saying.

<HEADLINE> Elsie Leung Explains Consultation Document to HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, China, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The rush legislation of
Societies Ordinance (SO) and Public Order Ordinance (POO) for the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is to avoid a
possible legal vacuum after the handover on July 1, a senior
official of the HKSAR Chief Executive's Office said here today.
</P>
<P>
Elsie Leung Oi-sie, Secretary of Justice of the future HKSAR,
made these remarks when she explained to the members of the HKSAR
Provisional Legislative Council the Consultation Document on Civil
Liberties and Social Order. The consultation, which started on
April 9 through 30, aims to invite public comments on proposals to
amend the two ordinances.
</P>
<P>
In February, the Standing Committee of China's National
People's Congress passed a resolution to the effect that three
sections of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and the major
amendments to the Societies Ordinance (SO) and the Public Order
Ordinance (POO) introduced in 1992 and 1995 respectively shall not
be adopted for the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Leung reiterated today three guiding principles in reviewing
the two ordinances. Firstly, the amendments must be consistent
with the Basic Law and the International Convention on Civil and
Political Rights (ICCPR); secondly, Hong Kong should remain a
free, peaceful, orderly and responsible society, in which
individual rights and interests should be protected; and thirdly,
Hong Kong should stick to the principle of territorial integrity
and political independence.
</P>
<P>
"In legislation, we need to see our way clear to the sort of
community we want. We want a peaceful and orderly society and we
do not want to wait for incidents to happen before we take
remedial actions," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We need the law in place so that all our community officers,
commissioners and police can take actions when necessary," she
continued.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to introduce the concept of national security,
which means territorial integrity and political independence,
according to Leung.
</P>
<P>
"For example, if someone asks Hong Kong to become an
independent state, that would definitely go against the principle
of territorial integrity," Leung said. "And also we want political
independence of the state being protected from foreign influence."
</P>
<P>
As for the rush legislation, it is because of the fear of a
vacuum in legislation. "Otherwise, after July 1, there would be
no laws for us to abide by," she said.

But by that time the Asian nation's population will still be
growing whereas the Italian population will fall marginally, the
Bank said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the first decade of the next century, the number
of Italians over 60 will have risen from 22 to 27 percent of its
population, while Japan's aging population over 60 will have risen
from 20 to 29 percent, said the bank.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the bank show that during the period
between 1995 to 2010, Italy's population can be expected to
decrease by 0.1 percent a year, compared with an increase of 0.1
percent in 1980-95.
</P>
<P>
This means that the country's population in 2010 will be about
the same as the 56 million found in the 1980 census.
</P>
<P>
Germany's population over 60 will account for 25 percent of the
total from the present 20 percent while the aging population in
France and Spain will rise from 20 to 30 percent.

<HEADLINE> Fertility, Mortality Rates Fall in Bangladesh: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is heading toward a
dramatic demographic transition with a sharp fall in fertility and
mortality rates, said a recent Asian Development Bank (ADB)
report.
</P>
<P>
Lauding the role of Bangladesh's efficient family planning
program, the report said Bangladesh has attracted wide attention
by achieving remarkable success beating unfavorable factors
including poverty and a low level of urbanization and non-farm
employment.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh belongs to the category of very few developing
countries in the world that are experiencing declining fertility,
it added.
</P>
<P>
"The country has now attained a total fertility rate of less
than four children per child-bearing woman on average, with at
least 40 percent of married couples practicing contraception," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Giving a brief account of Bangladesh's intense family welfare
endeavors, the report said, "The institution of family planning
program that offers a wide range of services, often at the
doorstep, and secures wide demand for modern contraceptives has
been the critical element in Bangladesh's success with fertility
transition."
</P>
<P>
The report, Asian Development Outlook 1997 and 1998, the latest
annual survey of economic progress in developing member countries
of the ADB, said that besides family welfare efforts, significant
economic and social changes have come into play to help lift
Bangladesh from its biggest problem.
</P>
<P>
The complex influences of the changes including breaking of the
intellectual and social isolation of the villages, expansion of
education and elimination of female seclusion by make-work schemes
and the expansion of textile and garment industries have
contributed to the fertility decline, the report added.

<HEADLINE> India Favors Thai Proposal for Economic Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- India favors Thailand's
proposal for a four-nation economic group comprising Thailand,
India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The proposed group, along with the recently formed Sub-Regional
Economic Cooperation (SREC) initiative involving India, Bhutan,
Nepal and Bangladesh, could be a right step toward "globalization"
in accordance with Prime Minister I. K. Gujral's "look east"
policy.
</P>
<P>
The Thai proposal, which is nearly four years old, aims to
establish a growth quadrangle with a view to promoting trade and
industrial collaboration. The proposal, originally made by the
Asian Development Bank (ADB), was for establishing trilateral
economic cooperation among Thailand, India and Sri Lanka, but
later Bangladesh became interested in it.
</P>
<P>
Officials here have said that since his days as the minister of
external affairs, Gujral has been strongly advocating a "look
east" policy, which is aimed at optimizing opportunities available
for economic cooperation in India's immediate and intermediate
neighborhood in East and Southeast Asian countries by establishing
proper synergy.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange (KLSE) closed lower this week due to lack of buying
support from institutions after a technical rebound on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the rebound on Monday was seen as a selling
opportunity for many.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Index slipped 15.13 points to end the week at
1,089.45 compared with 1,104.58 last week while the Emas Index
eased 3.64 points to 314.61, the Industrial Index fell 56.71
points to 2,027.14 and the Second Board Index was down 0.47 points
to 566.65.
</P>
<P>
The five-day Main Board turnover dropped to 962.251 billion
shares valued at 5.708 billion ringgit (over 2.28 billion U.S.
dollars) compared with 1.177 billion shares valued at 7.021
billion ringgit (over 2.8 billion dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
Second Board volume declined to 163.596 million shares valued
at 1.851 billion ringgit (over 740 million dollars), from 189.277
million shares worth 1.907 billion ringgit (over 762 million
dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
However, direct business deals increased to 262.170 million
shares valued at 1.823 billion ringgit (about 750 million
dollars), compared with 141.959 million shares valued at 1.192
billion ringgit (about 477 million dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
The top 10 active counters this week included Berjaya
Industries with a turnover of 37.952 million shares, Ekran rights
30.017 million shares, Aokam Perdana 25.629 million shares, Kuala
Lumpur Industries 23.484 million shares and Rahman Hydraulics
22.152 million shares.
</P>
<P>
On a sectoral basis, consumer products accounted for 93.896
million shares traded on the Main Board, industrial products
159.03 million, construction 91.388 million, trading/services
132.851 million, infrastructure 2.525 million, finance 107.239

plantation 24.122 million, mining 28.538 million, trusts 1.165
million, closed end funds 14.207 million, loans 20.831 million,
TSR/warrants 89.567 million and loans 30.899 million.
</P>
<P>
The KLSE is expected to fall further next week on lack of
domestic leads as local and foreign institutions will be
sidelined, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Index is expected to fall below 1,050 points next
week. At this level, it is expected to see some support, but if
that support is not strong enough, "then we may see the market
momentarily going below the 1,000 level next week," he said.
</P>
<P>
If that happens, it could spark a big rebound as investors pick
up cheap stocks, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody says they are waiting for the market to fall further
before coming in," said another dealer.
</P>
<P>
However, more optimistic investors said if market fell below
1,050, there would be support as the market was already oversold.

<HEADLINE> Italian Graduates Wait Long for Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Average Italian university graduates
can get jobs only 25 months after graduation, the country's
National Statistics Institute said today.
</P>
<P>
The other unemployed, who lack university education, have to
wait for 28 or 32 months before they get jobs, the institute said
in a report entitled The Labor Force in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Among the 2.763 million jobless people (the 1996 figure) in the
country, more than half were located in Mezzogiorno, south of
Rome, which has about 33 percent of the national population.
</P>
<P>
However, in northeastern Italy, such as the Veneto region and
the Lazio region, the employment is far more better with merely
261,000 jobless in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The statistics institute said there has been a fundamental
change in Italy's labor market these years due to the decline of
traditional job-providers including engineering and agriculture,
and as a result, many people have been forced into self-employment
in various service sectors.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that at the end of last year the Italian work
force was steadily moving into tertiary industries.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Urges Indonesians to Buy More Local Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
called on people again to buy local products, saying there was no
reason to prefer foreign products because local ones were just as
good and cheaper.
</P>
<P>
"The use of local goods should be made a national drive. Love
for our own products is part of nationalism," Soeharto said Friday
in Karawang, West Java, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
He said increased use of domestic products would enable local
industries to grow and strengthen Indonesia's economic foundation.
</P>
<P>
At present, Indonesia imports roughly 12 billion U.S. dollars
worth of capital goods and the same amount of raw materials a
year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia would continue to pursue industrialization by
improving human resource quality, optimizing the use of natural
resources and raising technological capabilities, noted the
president.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is committed to free market under the ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Free Trade Area in 2003
and under the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in 2020.

<HEADLINE> Local Election Campaigns Gain Momentum in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Nepali political parties'
campaigns for the forthcoming local elections gained momentum as
leaders of two ruling partners hinted an alliance between them.
</P>
<P>
Major ruling partner the Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) has authorized its local units to
decide whether to join hands with Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur
Chand's National Democratic Party (RPP), party sources here said.
</P>
<P>
There is possibility of alliance between the two ruling
partners at local levels for the elections, a CPN-UML spokesman
was quoted by local newspapers as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Nepali voters will elect chief officers and members of nearly
4,000 local administration bodies throughout the country at the
village, municipality and district levels from May 17.
</P>
<P>
RPP president Surya Bahadur Thapa, while announcing his party's
election manifesto Friday, also hinted a possible alliance with
the CPN-UML, which is the biggest party in the RPP-led three-party
ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
The RPP in its manifesto pledged to make the villages a focal
point for development and promised to provide local people with
education, drinking water, health, employment and infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the CPN-UML and main opposition the Nepali Congress
(NC) party, the country's two largest parties, declared their
election manifestoes, both stressing the local development and the
empowerment of local bodies and people.
</P>
<P>
NC President Girija Prasad Koirala has been traveling around
the country since last week to ensure solidarity among party
workers and garner voters' support for his party.
</P>
<P>
The NC party currently holds most of the local bodies in the
country while the CPN-UML and the RPP want to gain more control of
local authorities through next month's elections.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chand, a RPP leader, also made a tour of the
country recently as part of his party's campaign for the local
elections.

<HEADLINE> UNIDO Chief Calls for Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Mauricio de Maria y Campos,
General Director of the U.N. industrial Development Organization
(UNIDO) today called on industrialized nations to give their
support for the agency which faces a shaky future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of a week-long conference aimed at
reshaping the agency, he said that the continued existence of
UNIDO is highly necessary and is the wish of most developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
But because of the reservations of Germany and Britain, the
conference failed to reach a consensus on the future of the
agency, he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Australia have served notice that they plan to
withdraw from UNIDO, and Germany is reconsidering its
membership. The United States quit in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Major developed countries make up more than 70 percent of
the agency's budget.
</P>
<P>
UNIDO, established in 1967 and joined the U.N.in 1985,
specializes in promoting industrialization in developing countries
and coordinating U.N. industrial activities.
</P>
<P>
The agency has been plagued by overstaff and inefficiency in
recent years. It began reforms in 1993 to refocus its program and
cut nearly half of it headquarters personnel.
</P>
<P>
But a combination of budget constraints and questions whether
the U.N. should be involved at all in the development programs has
put the agency's future in doubt.
</P>
<P>
There have been proposals to merge UNIDO with other agencies,
and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan is expected to make a final
decision in June when the agency's 53-country board meets.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- India's new Prime Minister I.K.
Gujral has said that his government could not focus only on the 30
percent of Indians who were comfortable.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with local newspaper The Times of
India here Friday, which was published today, the prime minister
said that it had to pay attention to the 70 percent who were
deprived as well, "or else we will be sitting on a powder keg."
</P>
<P>
He said that the new government, which came to power on April
21 this year, would pay attention to the directive principles of
the Constitution, so that social justice and gender equality could
be promoted.
</P>
<P>
On economic policy in general, Gujral indicated that he would
strive for a middle path between those in favor of total opening
up of the economy to foreign companies and those seeking to retain
benefits for domestic industry.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that he would "preserve, safeguard and
protect" domestic industry. He stressed, however, that this did
not mean a return to protectionism. "We need to place ourselves in
the world economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister refuted the charge that the Gujral doctrine
(of having good relations with its neighbors) meant giving
concessions at the expense of Indian interests.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the "new mood of hope" in India-Pakistan
relations that was substantiated, for example, by the purchase by
Pakistan of 50,000 tons of Indian sugar.
</P>
<P>
He said that both India and its neighbors would benefit from
the Gujral doctrine, which was firmly based on the policy of
enlightened self-interest.
</P>
<P>
Turning to superpower relations, Gujral said, "If unipolar
means hegemonism, then it is not right and India will not endorse
it."

</P>
<P>
"We were able to restructure successfully the Andean Community
after Peru's withdrawal from the bloc," Burelli said.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the presidents of Venezuela, Bolivia, Colombia
and Ecuador, the four Andean Group member countries, discussed the
issues on the change of the group's name to the Andean Community
and peru's withdrawal from the organization after other member
countries refused to grant Peru tariff reductions.
</P>
<P>
He said that the positive results of the meeting will pave the
way for the Andean Community to negotiate its association with the
Southern Common Market (Mercosur) and to tighten cooperation and
trade relations with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Minister Burelli said that the Caribbean area is fundamental
for Venezuela's foreign policy because of its proximity with
the Caribbean islands and the importance they have on the
international level.
</P>
<P>
The relations with Asia and Europe are very important for
Venezuela, which will diversify its international markets and seek
new sources of investment and technology to promote the
industrial, social and economic developments in the country.

<P>
Dhaka, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The tribal rebels of Bangladesh's
southern Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) have suggested deferring the
ongoing peace talks with the government to May 11, official
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Parbattya Chattagram Janasanghati Samity (PCJSS), the
political wing of the so-called Shanti Bahini insurgents, in a
recent letter to the government suggested the new date for the
fifth round of peace talks, which was scheduled to resume on April
30.
</P>
<P>
The PCJSS has also suggested that the talks take place in
Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, peace talks between the Awami (people's) League
government and the Buddhist rebels for ending the decades-old bush
war in the CHT ended inconclusively on March 13.
</P>
<P>
In earlier talks, disagreement between the two sides persisted
on the key issues of expelling non-tribal settlers from the three
hill districts, withdrawal of government forces, land rights to
the tribes people and an autonomous regional council.
</P>
<P>
However, both sides in the last peace talks agreed to meet
again and extended the current ceasefire to June 30.

BANGKOK, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is planning to launch a
pilot project to increase its capacity to produce value-added
products, like mannitol and sorbital, to prop its sugar industry
as world sugar prices are expected to drop next year.

the hydrogenation process, are used as sweeteners in various
things ranging from medicine to bubble gum and toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
Thailand currently exports about 4.5 million tons of sugar each
year, accounting for 80 percent of its domestic production.
However, it consumes about 30 tons of mannitol and sorbital
annually, nearly all of them imported.
</P>
<P>
The new plant is expected to meet Thailand's domestic demand
for mannitol and sorbital. It also will enable Thailand to export
the products to other Asian countries.

TEGUCIGALPA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The armies of Honduras, El
Salvador and Nicaragua are to jointly patrol the Gulf of Fonseca in
the Pacific coast of Central America to prevent fishing incidents
or of any other nature, a Honduran military spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate when the operation will start, but said it
will begin very soon.

BANGKOK, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Supreme Court has

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad will visit the African continent next week to
boost South-South cooperation, according to official sources
today.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir will first visit Malawi on May 1-3 followed by

At present, there are no Malaysian investments in Botswana
which is the world's largest producer of diamonds by value.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's trade with Bostwana in 1996 increased to 1.35
million ringgit (about 0.54 million U.S. dollars) from 0.54
million ringgit (about 0.2 million U.S. dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir will be in South Africa on May 7 where he will receive
the Order of Good Hope, South Africa's highest award, from

<HEADLINE> Feature: Law Starts to Rule in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- For eight years, government
officials in China attempted unsuccessfully to settle a dispute
between parties over territorial rights by means of administrative
decrees.
</P>
<P>
Finally acknowledging that their orders had been ignored,
officials turned to the country's recently-established rule by law
and cleared up the matter in just four months.
</P>
<P>
In March last year, China decided to set up a system of rule by
law, the effectiveness of which can be found in the case of the
Hengshan Fishing Harbor in south China's Guangdong Province, long
a favorite hangout for fisherman taking shelter from the elements
or looking to sell their fish.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, an increasing number of farmers came to the
channel to raise oysters, ultimately clashing with the fisherman
over who should occupy the waterway.
</P>
<P>
To resolve the matter, the township government issued orders
year after year calling on farmers to clear the channel of
oysters. But the farmers didn't comply.
</P>
<P>
In August of last year, when a nationwide campaign to promote
the rule by law had finally trickled down from the top echelons to
the village level, the local officials turned to the law for help.
</P>
<P>
The Hengshan government studied the provisions on channel
management, the law on sea traffic safety, regulations on managing
fishing harbors and other laws that were useful, then spread the
information and spelled out specific penalties for violators.
</P>
<P>
Four months later, the channel was cleared.
</P>
<P>
"We have tasted the sweet flavor of administering according to
law. We are now faced with fewer obstacles, and our work
efficiency has improved," said You Fuqiang, head of the Hengshan
Town Government.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that some government departments used to collect
fees from oyster raisers, "which was wrong." He says the practice
will not continue, as the government heads themselves must follow
the rule by law.
</P>
<P>
There have been many similar incidents in China, which show
that the law is becoming more powerful than government decrees.
</P>
<P>
In another situation, the government of Pingshi Town of Lechang
City, Guangdong, appointed three village heads at the end of last
year. The township people's congress ruled this unlawful, based on
the organizational law on village committees which says that
village heads must be elected, not appointed.
</P>
<P>
Finally, elections were held in February to name three
officials, and the governmental appointment orders became invalid
and were regarded as "wastepaper."

Elsewhere, in Zhaoqing City of Guangdong, a government
department proposed earlier this year to stop service of the
telephone number listed in illegal false advertisements for phony
medical cures posted in streets as a punishment for the
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
After studying the Administrative Punishment Law, the city
government decided such action was also in violation of the law,
and later adopted other measures mandated by the statute.
</P>
<P>
The public is even more enthusiastic about the rule by law.
Liu Sanmei, a farmer in Gaoyao City of Guangdong, said that the
most obvious effects of the rule by law have been the improvement
of public security, better behavior of village officials and
closer ties between officials and citizens.
</P>
<P>
"Things are now being done in line with the law, not out of
officials' personal decisions, as they used to be," she said.
</P>
<P>
Despite such progress, many officials and the public still
claim that China has a long way to go to reach its goal of
effective rule by law.
</P>
<P>
"Some officials are still using their personal clout to
influence the compliance of law, or abusing their power for
personal interests, and the public awareness of law, including
that of officials, has yet to be further promoted," an official
with the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress said.
</P>
<P>
"However, for a country accustomed to abiding by the rule of
man for thousands of years, the progress in the rule by law is
truly encouraging," an NPC official said.
</P>
<P>
Since the reform and opening up initiated in the late 1970s,
China's top legislature has drafted more than 300 pieces of
legislation and local legislatures have also made their own laws
and regulations which are in keeping with local characteristics.
</P>
<P>
"The country now has laws governing all aspects of its
political, economical and social lives, while the chaotic era with
no rules to follow has become bygone," the NPC official said.

</P>
<P>
Question: How to understand the executive departments being

members of the Council, and obtaining approval from the Council
for taxation and public expenditure.
</P>
<P>

Against Corruption?
</P>
<P>
Answer: After 1997, the Commission Against Corruption will
continue to exist in the Hong Kong SAR. It will work independently
and be responsible to the Chief Executive.

<HEADLINE> Chinese City Turns Industrial Waste Into Building Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Luoyang, in central China's
Henan Province, has found a way to use industrial waste to make
building materials, which are being used on 90 percent of the
city's new construction projects.
</P>
<P>
The city has lost 133 hectares of farmland to piles of
industrial waste from brick making. The city has eight
coal-burning power plants which discharge 1.89 million tons of
waste, seriously polluting the environment.
</P>
<P>
It also has 434 factories producing solid clay bricks, on 666.7
hectares of land, which destroy 73 hectares of farmland each year
for brick production.
</P>
<P>
To halt this process, the city, whose per capita available
farmland is below the national average, set up a special office to
control production of clay bricks and to look for ways to turn
useless coal ash into useful building materials.
</P>
<P>
The city now has 42 factories that produce new building
materials using industrial waste as the chief ingredient,
producing 370 million bricks in more than a dozen types each year.
</P>
<P>
The bricks are tested for hardness, weight, temperature
changes, and sound-proof characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The new building materials have had various benefits by saving
energy and farmland, and improving the environment, say local
officials.
</P>
<P>
The city was cited by four central government departments for
outstanding achievements in 1996.

SAN JOSE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Central America will seek
closer political and economic ties with the United States at a
meeting between leaders of the Central American nations and US
President Bill Clinton, Costa Rican Foreign Relations Minister
Fernando Naranjo said today.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, to arrive in San Jose on May 7, is expected to meet
the presidents of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras,
Guatemala and the Dominican Republic, and the prime minister of

United States, Canada and Mexico, and the Mercosur consisting of
Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, propose different
strategies to form the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by
the year 2005, agreed by 34 countries in the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
NAFTA suggests that tariff reduction take effect in 2005, while
the Mercosur countries said they need more time to adapt their
economies to the challenge of integration.
</P>
<P>
Naranjo said the agenda of the summit scheduled for May 8 would
give priority to the formation of the FTAA, consolidation of the
new Central American regimes and the new U.S. immigration law
which threatens thousands of Central Americans living in the
United States.
</P>

He added that the meeting would also discuss "human investment"
in health and education as well as environmental protection.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Three Parties Reject Campaign Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Indonesia's three
political parties, which will take part in the May 29 general
election, have expressed their rejection to campaign unrest,
official sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
Party leaders, government officials and religious figures
joined in prayers Friday here for a successful 27-day-long
campaign which begins Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the campaigning period, each party will receive a
seven-day turn.
</P>
<P>
The United Development Party (PPP), the ruling party of Golkar
and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) will vie for 425 seat in
the House of Representatives in the forthcoming election, the
sixth since the new order administration led by President
Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Golkar Chairman Harmoko called on all parties to develop
positive attitudes as they entered the campaign to maintain
national unity.
</P>
<P>
PPP chief Ismail Hasan Metareum expected the chairman of the
Indonesian Election Committee to remind local authorities that
they must not add clauses to their campaigning permits.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to difficulties faced by his party in East and
Central Java in obtaining police permits for their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
PDI leader Soerjadi said that his party's regional officials
face constraints similar to PPP's.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that his party would not solely rely on its
campaign to win votes. Soerjadi did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Yogie S. Memet said on the occasion that
the government will respond to any report related to difficulties
faced by political parties during the campaigning.
</P>
<P>
Memet, concurrently chairman of the Election Committee, said
the government is well prepared to face public unrest. "We will
try to avoid all potential disturbances," he added.
</P>
<P>
More than 124 million Indonesians are eligible to vote in this
year's election.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Take Steps to Ease Traffic Jams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Facing worsening urban traffic
congestion, the Chinese capital yesterday announced a series of
new measures to regulate traffic on the city's main streets,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The measures reflect one of Beijing's efforts to improve its
image this year, said Chen Zenmin, director of the Municipal
Public Security Traffic Administration (MPSTA).
</P>
<P>
The new measures, ranging from prescribing more one-way roads
and parking spaces for motor vehicles to improving traffic
management and infrastructure, will be put into practice in the
following months.
</P>
<P>
These include setting aside a special traffic lane for public
buses, which now serve more than one-third of Beijing's urban
passengers. The special bus lanes will first be provided along
Chang'an Avenue, the capital's No.1 downtown artery, before July
1, according to Yu Chunquan, deputy-director of the MPSTA.
</P>
<P>
Within this year, three other such bus traffic lanes are to be
opened on Chongwenmenwai, Fuchengmenwai as well as Chaoyangmenwai
avenues, three of the city's busiest roads suffering from massive
traffic jams for years, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Citing public complaints about the city's chaotic traffic
situation, the officials blamed it on the drastic increase in the
number of of automobiles in the city, which has hit a record 1.16
million to date -- up 30 percent from 1995 -- while overall road
space remains nearly the same.
</P>
<P>
Also, various traffic violations have not been effectively
controlled while the city's overall plan of traffic administration
and management have lagged far behind economic development.
</P>
<P>
The marked bus lanes will narrow the city's traffic lanes. As a
result, the new rule should force vehicles to make way for buses
on the city's several busiest downtown roads, prevent them from
hindering buses near crowded bus stops and make it more convenient
for millions of bus commuters during rush hours.

UNITED NATIONS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin ratified on April 7 the Convention on the Prohibition of the
Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons
and on Their Destruction (CWC).
</P>
<P>
The President ratified the Convention in accordance with a
decision of the Twenty-Third Session of the Standing Committee of
the Eighth National People's Congress. The CWC was opened for
signature in Paris on January 13, 1993.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen issued on the
same day a statement, stressing that the purposes, objectives and
principles of CWC should be strictly observed.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed that any country which has abandoned chemical
weapons on the territory of another country should effectively
implement the relevant CWC provisions, undertake the obligations
to destroy those chemical weapons. The whole statement is as
the following:
</P>
<P>
1. China has always stood for complete prohibition and thorough
destruction of chemical weapons. As CWC has laid an international
legal foundation for the realization of this goal, China supports
the purposes, objectives and principles of CWC.
</P>
<P>
2. China calls on the countries with chemical weapons arsenals
to ratify CWC without delay with a view to attaining its purposes
and objectives at an early date.
</P>
<P>
3. The purposes, objectives and principles of CWC should be
strictly observed. The provisions concerning challenge inspection
shall not be abused and the national security interests of state
parties not related to chemical weapons shall not be compromised.
China is firmly opposed to any act of abusing the verification
which endangers its sovereignty and security.
</P>
<P>
4. Any country which has abandoned chemical weapons on the
territory of another country should effectively implement the
relevant CWC provision, undertake the obligations to destroy those
chemical weapons and ensure the earliest complete destruction of
all the chemical weapons it has abandoned on another state's
territory.
</P>
<P>
5. CWC should play a sound role in promoting international
trade, scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation for
peaceful purposes in the field of chemical industry. It should
become the effective legal basis for regulating trade, cooperation
and exchange among the state parties in the field of chemical
industry.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations Qin
Huasun on Friday presented the instrument of ratification and the
statement to the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is the
depositary of the CWC.

<HEADLINE> U.S.,Japan Agree to Avoid Trade Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Japan on
Friday agreed that they must be careful to avoid a resurgence of
Japan's trade surplus to avoid U.S.-Japanese trade frictions,
which eased over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference at the White House after he held
discussion with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro, President Bill
Clinton said: "I told Prime Minister Hashimoto we need to build
on this success, to create new opportunities. We both want to
promote strong domestic, demand-led growth in Japan and to avoid a
significant increase in Japan's external surplus."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Clinton sent a personal letter to
Hashimoto, urging him to stabilize Japan's financial system and
reduce trade deficit with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto told reporters that Japan supports "the common
objective of avoiding a significant increase in Japan's external
surplus by promoting strong domestic, demand-led growth in Japan."

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Speeding up Use of Natural Gas Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Tarim, Jungar, and Turfan-Hami
oilfields in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region
have natural gas treatment equipment and long-distance pipelines
to move the gas to petrochemical stations at Krola, Karamay and
Urumqi.
</P>
<P>
The pipelines have been in use since last autumn and have a
yearly transport capacity of two billion cubic meters of natural
gas.
</P>
<P>
Yang Ajin, an engineer in charge of installing the equipment,
says that about 120,000 US dollars worth of natural gas and
liquefied petroleum gas have been sent daily.
</P>
<P>
The Turfan-Hami field in east Xinjiang opened China's largest
natural gas treatment facility in March. This year, five oil and
gas fields in the Turfan-Hami field with an annual production of
2.93 million tons of crude oil and 900 million cubic meters of
natural gas have the idea of adding 300,000 tons of crude oil and
400 million cubic meters of natural gas to their production this
year.
</P>
<P>
The central government has spent over 1.2 billion US dollars on
utilizing the natural gas resources to develop the chemical
fertilizer industry, making the area China's largest nitrogenous
fertilizer production base.
</P>
<P>
The capital, Urumqi, has obtained carbamide production
equipment that will be in operation in June. By 2000, Xinjiang's
carbamide production capacity will reach 3.16 million tons, up
from 630,000 tons in 1996, and accounting for 20 percent of
China's total carbamide production.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that by the year 2000, Xinjiang will need 1.4
million tons of nitrogenous fertilizer annually. In addition to
meeting its own needs, Xinjiang can supply over one million tons
of nitrogenous fertilizer to other regions.
</P>
<P>
By 1996, Xinjiang had proven natural gas reserves of 356.7
billion cubic meters. Natural gas production will reach 6.9
billion cubic meters by the end of this century.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Shijiazhuang, the capital
city of north China's Hebei Province, has been designated as a
pilot city for China's scientific water management in 21st century
by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
Experts from the UNDP inspected the management of the city's
water resources.
</P>
<P>
The experts will focus their studies on building an efficient
water management system for Chinese cities to ease the country's
urban water crisis.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP will provide technological aids to solve the problem,
which is caused by increasing consumption of water in cities due
to the rapid development of the urban economy.
</P>
<P>
The Shijiazhuang has put the project at the top of the agenda
for the next few years, and organized a task force for the
project, which they regard as the "project of life".

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japanese Leaders Holds Wide-range Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Friday held
wide-range talks on Asia-Pacific issues, including relationship
with China, bilateral security cooperations and issues of the
Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference at the White House after
their discussions, Clinton told reporters that both Hashimoto and
he himself believed in the importance of positive relationship
with China.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister and I agreed on the critical importance of
cooperative relations with China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto made the similar remarks, saying: "The president and
I agreed on the special significance of establishing constructive
cooperative relations with China."
</P>
<P>
As regards to a friendship treaty signed this week by China's
President Jiang Zeming and Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
Clinton said "a good cooperative partnership" between China and
Russia "is part of a larger balance of forces working toward
security, open trade and genuine respect for borders."
</P>
<P>
"I think that's a positive thing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Before his talks with Hashimoto, Clinton told reporters "as
long as any agreement China and Russia make is consistent with
positive partnership... I think we don't have anything to worry
about."
</P>
<P>
When asked about the U.S. military presence in japan, Clinton
said the United States would take measures to reduce the burden on
Japan of U.S. military bases there.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is very aware that our presence... has
imposed burdens on the people of Okinawa," he said. He promised to
implement a series of steps agreed to last year to make the U.S.
military presence on Okinawa less burdensome.
</P>
<P>
After three U.S. servicemen raped a Japanese schoolgirl on
Okinawa in 1995, U.S. troops kept low profile and the Pentagon has
taken measure to move some troops to other bases as a way to quiet
down outrages of Okinawan residents who demanded the U.S. bases
there be removed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also appealed the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) to enter peace talks with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
DPRK's willingness to talks with South Korea will "resolve all
their differences"... that will permit the rest of us not only to
give emergency food aid... but to work with them in restructuring
their entire economy," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese World No. 4 Lost in Team Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Japanese tested the
nerves of Chinese teenagers as they won a game in their 1-3 loss
to defending champions at the women's team competition of the
World Table Tennis Championships here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Keiko Okazaki beat China's world fourth-ranked Yang Ying at
the third game, forcing world No. 1 Deng Yaping to round off the
match.
</P>
<P>
The 75th-ranked Japanese played a desperately aggressive game,
won 21-13, 23-21 over the 19-year-old penholder, who became more
and more impatient as her forehand attacks failed to make a kill.
</P>
<P>
"This loss shows Yang is still young and she has a long way to
go to catch up with Deng," said Chinese head coach Lu Yuansheng.
</P>
<P>
"A defeat in group matches did more good than bad to Yang and
she will be ready for tougher games," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Deng, who has clinched 15 world championship
and World Cup titles in her 11-year-long career, easily won the
fourth game against Rika Matsuoka despite suffering serious ankle
and back injuries.
</P>
<P>
Deng, who has also collected four Olympic gold medals, had put
China ahead as she routed Ai Sakata 21-7, 21-11 in less than 20
minutes at the opening game.
</P>
<P>
Wang Nan, 18, the youngest player on the Chinese team, made it
2-0 with a 21-12, 21-15 victory over Rika.
</P>
<P>
Japan benched top player Koyama Chire in a move that the
Chinese coach called a show of cowardice.
</P>
<P>
"Chire shunned this match because she didn't have confidence
to beat Deng Yaping," said Lu.
</P>
<P>
Chire, who won a world singles title in her Chinese name of He
Zhili in 1987, joined the Japanese squad after marrying a
Japanese coach. She hasn't met Deng since the upset victory over
the world No. 1 in the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan.
</P>
<P>
China is to play its last group match against Belgium on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Germany clinched two five-set matches to move closer to the
quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Jie Schoepp clinched a dream sequence of seven points to win
the deciding game, anchoring the German women to a cliff-hanging
victory over the Democratic People's Republic of Korea early
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Germany later outlasted Hong Kong 3-2 in their second-to-last
group match.
</P>
<P>
In the men's competition, defending champion China nipped
Italy 3-0. Sweden also had a clean sheet in its match against
Austria.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Chief Says Chinese Economy Growing Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James
Wolfensohn today praised the World Bank-financed projects in China
and the Chinese economy which took a soft landing after heated
growth two years ago.
</P>
<P>
While addressing a press conference at the World Bank-IMF joint
spring meetings, Wolfensohn said the Chinese economy was growing
well, but the international financial institutions still had an
important role to play there.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank leader also stressed that huge distortions still
existed in the Chinese economy which the Bank could tackle in an
effort to make the country more attractive to foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"We have plenty of business in China," Wolfensohn said. "We can
bring expertise in areas like poverty alleviation."
</P>
<P>
He noted that although China has already absorbed in a
disproportionate share of global capital, the World Bank would
continue to look for ways to make China still more attractive to

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said earlier this week in
its latest World Economic Outlook that it expected China's economy
to grow 9.5 percent in 1997, down slightly from 9.7 percent in
1996, still one of the highest growth rates. Meanwhile, the report
said China's retail price inflation slowed further to 6 percent,
down from 22 percent in 1994. The soft landing has set the stage
for continued expansion.

Wolfensohn also told reporters the World Bank was kicking off a
debt-relief plan for the world's poorest countries. Uganda is
selected to be the first beneficiary of the initiative, called the
Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs), starting next April. Two
months later, he added, Bolivia, Burkina Faso and Cote d'Ivoire
will also benefit. Other countries on the list are mainly African
countries which are expected to benefit from the package include
Benin, Mali, Togo and Guyana.

<HEADLINE> Britain Issues Guidelines in Case of Election Disruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain issued guidelines for
election officials today on how to react to any terrorist attempt
to disrupt the May 1 election.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Home Office (interior ministry) said the security
guidelines had been issued in response to requests from election
officials rather than as a direct result of travel chaos that
happened earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines include advance searches of polling venues and
even searches of some voters' bags, officials said.
</P>
<P>
"We have no reason to believe there will be an attack on the
poll or the count," a spokesman said. "The reason we issued the
guidelines was in response to a number of requests from returning
officers about what to do if there is disruption."
</P>
<P>
There have been several explosions and bomb threats on major
motorway and rail stations since the election campaign started in
mid-March, causing chaos and losses of millions of pounds. The
Irish Republican Army (IRA), fighting British rule of Northern
Ireland, are believed to be behind the disruption.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines said police would aim to "enable the electoral
process to continue uninterrupted unless that would pose a clear
risk to public safety." Voting could even be adjourned to the
following day if disruption to the election was severe, the
document said.
</P>
<P>
"Should a bomb threat be received, the police will assess its
credibility and consider, in the light of the security measures in
place, what level of response is appropriate," the document said.
</P>
<P>
It also warned that the counting of votes after polling ended
could also be disrupted by bomb warnings.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Rises Against Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rose sharply
against the mark and ended higher in other dealings Friday.
</P>
<P>
The market was largely affected by the remarks of the top
economist of Germany's biggest bank who predicted the U.S.
currency could rally to 1.8000 marks and 130 yen.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin also contributed to the
dollar's advance by reiterating his support for a strong U.S.
currency on the eve of the Group of Seven industrialized nation
summit in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Traders interpreted Rubin's remarks as a sign that Britain,
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States would
tolerate dollar's gradual ascent and aren't ready to intervene
yet.
</P>
<P>
In New York the dollar rose to 1.7270 marks, up from 1.7150
Thursday and the highest level in nearly two weeks. The dollar
cost 126.25 yen, up from 126.13. The pound cost 1.6231 U.S.
dollars, down from 1.6263 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday:
5.8270 French francs, up from 5.7850; 1.4695 Swiss francs, up from
1.4604; 1,717.00 Italian lira, up from 1,705.00; 1.3967 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.3920.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls on Resolving Prevlaka Issue Through Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The UN Security Council
today called Croatia and Yugoslavia to resolve the disputed issue
of Prevlaka through bilateral negotiations pursuant to the
Agreement on Normalization of Relations signed last August and in
the spirit of the UN Charter.
</P>
<P>
In a statement adopted today, the Security Council expressed
concern at continuing violations of the demilitarization regime,
including movements of heavy weapons and of special police of
Croatia and the entry by a navy missile boat of Yugoslavia into
the demilitarized zone.
</P>
<P>
The council called upon the parties to refrain from provocative
actions of all kinds, to cease violations of the militarized zone
and to cooperate fully with the UN military observers.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also reiterated its call upon both parties
to adopt the practical options for improvement of the safety and
security in the area proposed by the UN military observers, to
remove landmines from areas patrolled by the military observers
and stop their interference with the freedom of movement of the
military observers.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Move Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks pulled back
again today amid worries that new economic data will reveal more
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 53.38 to 6,738.87.
</P>
<P>
After gaining 173 points on Tuesday, the Dow has fallen for
three straight sessions, trimming the week's gain to just 35
points.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where the volume declined to 414.32
million from 485.41 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 5.81 to 765.37, and
the NYSE's composite index fell 3.24 to 400.38.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 18.81 to 1,209.29, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.12 to 542.83.
</P>
<P>
Broader measures also retreated as interest rates crept back
toward their highest levels since July in the bond market. The
biggest damage came in the technology-heavy Nasdaq market, which
gave back more than half of its gains from a three-day winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
Investors worry that any signs of robust economic growth may
spur the Fed to increase interest rates for a second time this year
when its policy-makers meet on May 20.

<HEADLINE> Development of Low Cost Housing Urged in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa today urged for the development of low-and-medium
cost housing for average urban dwellers in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa made the call during the inauguration ceremony of
Haidery Plaza in the city, an eight-story shopping center which
cost over seven million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"I want as many Tanzanians as possible to be home-owners. A
visit to any of our neighboring countries will show excellent
programs of good quality, clean and low-cost housing schemes,"
Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
"There are several obstacles to the development of good
low-and-medium cost housing in Tanzania, which include the
inexcusable lack of ideas among the people we have entrusted with
this task," he added.
</P>
<P>
Other obstacles include too much bureaucracy, corruption, lack
of adequate and affordable financial services for the housing
sector, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa advised the insurance companies, pension funds and
private investors to pioneer the development of such schemes.

</P>
<P>
The poll, by Ekos Research Associates, found that 50 percent of

with the Bloc Quebecois in Quebec province and well ahead of the
other parties in all other regions of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Compared with one taken in November, the current Ekos poll
indicated that the Liberals retained the bulk of their earlier
support.
</P>
<P>
In the new poll, 50.1 percent of decided voters said they would
vote Liberal, compared with 52.6 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
For the Progressive Conservatives, the support level was 14.7
percent, compared with 13.1.

<HEADLINE> House Speaker Gingrich to View Flooded Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Speaker Newt Gingrich of the
House of Representatives plans to fly over the flood-plagued
Minnesota-North Dakota border to get a first-hand look at damage
caused by the swollen Red River.
</P>
<P>
Congress must approve the 788 million dollars in federal aid
that U.S. President Bill Clinton is seeking to provide for flood
victims.
</P>
<P>
The Red River crested at Grand Forks, North Dakota, at more
than 54 feet -- 26 feet over flood stage earlier this week. The
water has receded about four feet since then, but is expected to
remain high for several more days.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich is scheduled to arrive a Grand Forks Air Force base
late Friday afternoon to join Minnesota Governor Arne Carlson and
Representative Collin Peterson on an aerial tour of the flood
plain.
</P>
<P>
Reports said officials are allowing more residents of Grand
Forks, North Dakota, and East Grand Forks, Minnesota, to return to
their homes to retrieve valuables and assess the damage. But it
will be weeks before they are able to go home for good.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Commerce Department Corrects Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) - The U.S. Commerce Department
today released corrected figures showing a 10.4 billion U.S.
dollar deficit in February.
</P>
<P>
The corrected one is 1.2 billion dollars less than the 11.6
billion dollars figure originally reported one week ago. The
January figure also was revised down, to 12.3 billion dollars from
12.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The error occurred in oil import figures and was blamed on a
miscommunication between the Customs Service, an agency of the
Treasury Department that collects data at ports, border
checkpoints and airports, and the Census Bureau, the agency of the
Commerce Department that files the trade report.
</P>
<P>
Commerce originally reported that America's foreign oil bill
rose 14 percent in February to 5.7 billion dollars on a seasonally
adjusted basis. Actually, it decreased 2.3 percent to 4.6 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the total of all goods and services imported into
the country was 83.9 billion dollars instead of the 85.1 billion
dollars originally reported.
