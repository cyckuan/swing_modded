<HEADLINE> Two rare engine failures reported on Continental jets at Newark  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - In only 25 instances from 1985-99 have
aircraft engine parts ripped through the engine covering. Two such
incidents have occurred at Newark International Airport this year,
both involving Continental Airlines DC-10s.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt in the Newark incidents. The 25 ''uncontained
engine failures'' accounted for two deaths and 16 injuries,
according to records of the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're a little unusual,'' said William D. Waldock, a
professor of aeronautical science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical
University in Prescott, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The engines are designed to eject parts out the rear, which
poses less of a threat to the aircraft and its occupants, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most common causes are metal failure or when birds are
sucked into the engine. An unbalanced turbine blade can also cause
such a failure, but that is usually detected during routine
maintenance, Waldock said.
</P>
<P>
   The GE engines are reliable, but require more attention as they
log more miles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real key is the maintenance. If it's maintained properly,
you can keep running them almost indefinitely,'' Waldock said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Newark incidents, on Tuesday and April 25, involved
different aircraft, but both were Flight 60, from Newark to
Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are isolated, separate instances of engine failure,''
Continental spokesman David Messing said from the airline's Houston
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   All engines on Continental's 24 DC-10s are made by General
Electric Co., Messing said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We use them, the manufacturer, exclusively for all
overhauls,'' he said. Messing could not say when the most recent
maintenance was performed on the engines that failed.
</P>
<P>
   GE Aircraft Engines, based in Cincinnati, performs overhauls
every few years, but routine maintenance is done by the airline, GE
spokesman Rick Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   He could not immediately provide the date of the last overhaul
for either of the engines involved, which he said were about 20 to
25 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The engine model, CF6-50, has a good service record and is the
best-selling engine for large aircraft, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The early indications are that both engines suffered a failure
toward the rear of the engine, not the heart, he said. As a result,
neither lost all power.
</P>
<P>
   The DC-10 is used by more than 60 airlines and has an excellent
service record, Messing said. Continental, which has more than 500
aircraft, is replacing its DC-10s with Boeing 767s over the next
two years.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating both
incidents at Newark, which is a Continental hub.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Flight 60's takeoff was aborted about 7:20 p.m.
after sparks and debris were seen coming from the center engine.
Airport workers found turbine blades and metal debris on the runway
afterward, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jim Peters
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 237 passengers safely exited the plane on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said the engine will be taken
apart by agency personnel, along with FAA and GE representatives.
He could not say when that would happen or when a cause would be
determined.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Flight 60 returned to Newark 34 minutes after takeoff
with two of its three engines failing, blown tires and ruptured
hydraulic lines, the NTSB said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has not issued its conclusions on that incident.
</P>
<P>
   The Newark incidents are the latest problem for Continental
involving a DC-10. French investigators announced Monday that a
stray length of metal that gashed a tire of a supersonic Concorde,
leading to a fuel tank fire and dooming the flight, probably came
from a Continental Airlines plane that took off on the same runway
four minutes earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Continental officials are cooperating with that investigation,
but have not said that the metal part was from one of their DC-10s.

<HEADLINE> United Pilots'OKs Contract For Vote  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A tentative contract agreement between United
Airlines and its pilots is a step closer to final approval after
the ruling council of the pilots' union endorsed it Friday.
</P>
<P>
   United's executive council of the Air Line Pilots Association
voted 29-0 to approve the offer and recommended it to members,
union spokeswoman Kathy White said.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement clears United's 10,500 pilots to vote on the
pact. The voting will be by mail and final results are not expected
for about six weeks, White said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which would give the pilots industry-leading pay,
is already having an effect at other airlines, where pilots are now
seeking better terms.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots' deal has helped United get its operations back in
order after a nightmarish summer of cancellations and flight
delays. But it still must settle a labor standoff with 44,000
mechanics, ramp workers and reservations workers of the
International Association of Machinists. The talks went to federal
mediation this week.

<HEADLINE> French Fuel Still Scarce  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA DOLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France (AP) -- In car after car, impatient drivers smoked,
read the paper or bickered with line-jumpers Friday as they waited
to fill their tanks at the only gas station open for regular
business in France's third-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been waiting three hours,'' said Philippe Le Roi, a
salesman who has had to stop visiting clients because his car is
nearly empty.
</P>
<P>
   Five days after truckers across France began a blockade of oil
refineries and depots to protest high fuel prices, Lyon is one of
the worst-hit cities, with flights canceled and almost every drop
of gasoline reserved for emergency vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, motorists nationwide had new hope the pumps might
soon reopen when a leading truckers' union called for lifting the
blockades. But a smaller union refused to back down, and farmers,
ambulances and even tow-truck drivers continued to demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the National Federation of Agricultural
Workers, one of the largest farm unions in France, said the
government had made a promising offer and that he would ask the
union to call off its protest.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Luc Duval, head of the National Center of Young Farmers,
also said he would also ask members of his organization to end
their protest.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the government offered farmers a 30 percent
decrease in gasoline taxes for the year 2000, Guyau said after
meeting with Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such steps are headed in the right direction even if we have
not abandoned the idea of the complete withdrawal of the tax in the
coming years,'' Guyau said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday, the protesters have drawn international attention
to the difficulties they face as world fuel prices soar. They say
France's gasoline taxes -- the second-highest in the 15-member
European Union -- aggravate the problem.
</P>
<P>
   At Lyon's Lyon-Saint-Exupery airport, 18 flights were canceled
Friday because the airport has been unable to refuel planes.
</P>
<P>
   Rental car agencies had vehicles to offer, but little gasoline.
It was nearly impossible to find a cab for hire because most of the
city's taxi drivers have joined the protest. Still other cab
drivers had no fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Some travelers arriving at the international airport were
baffled.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the French government is very weak to allow this to
happen,'' said Gareth Bevan, a Londoner who flew in to Lyon for a
wedding, along with 17 others. ''We were very worried we wouldn't
be able to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   Many French motorists have sympathized with the plight of those
whose livelihood depends on gasoline. In France, a gallon of diesel
fuel costs $2.84, nearly twice the price in the United States.
Unleaded gasoline averages $3.81 a gallon, and about 75 percent of
that is tax. Fuel prices have jumped about 40 percent in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   On the outskirts of Lyon, farmers and truckers blockading the
Feyzin refinery have slept in their trucks for days. Still, they
managed to keep up their spirits, lunching on baguettes, jugs of
wine and freshly picked apples under a huge white party tent.
Someone brought along an enormous brown cow to keep the protesters
company.
</P>
<P>
   But the county fair atmosphere belied serious concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have to abandon our professions if the
government doesn't do something,'' said 60-year-old Marcel Damien,
whose ancestors have been farmers for eight generations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being a farmer is difficult enough, but with fuel prices up
...'' he said, shaking his head as his voice trailed off.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Gonnet, who owns a transport company, said the protests
were forcing the government to pay attention to the fuel price
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''Normally, 800 trucks a day take fuel out of here,'' said
Gonnet, a member of the UNOSTRA union, the one truckers' group that
has not called an end to the protests. ''Not today.''
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, Transportation Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, Glavany
and Budget Secretary Florence Parly met with Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin on Friday afternoon to address the crisis. No details were
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the leftist government offered to give truckers a
tax refund of 19 cents per gallon this year, followed by a 6-cent
per gallon refund next year. One of the three protesting unions
accepted the offer on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   The two others held out, however. On Friday, after an overnight
meeting with Gayssot, the largest union, the National Federation of
Road Transport, accepted the deal and called for a lifting of the
barricades.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the group, known as FNTR, was not likely to put
an immediate end to the tense situation, with 112 refineries and
depots sealed off throughout France and 160 blockades in place,
according to the National Center for Road Information.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the FNTR, in disagreement with national leaders,
kept their barricades in place.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Football Player Dies Post Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRELLS, N.C. (AP) -- A high school football player died Friday
night after collapsing during a game.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar William Johnson, 17, a junior at Harrells Academy, was
pronounced dead at Sampson County Regional Medical Center sometime
after 8 p.m., said hospital spokeswoman Ann Butler.
</P>
<P>
   The school's headmaster, Jackie Parrish, said Johnson collapsed
after making a routine tackle during Harrells' game against Wake
Christian Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish said Johnson started to come off the field following the
play, spoke briefly to coach Bron Thompson and collapsed. A doctor
and medics at the game were unsuccessful in attempts to revive him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just an outstanding young man,'' Parrish said. ''He
worked hard in the weight room and did everything to make himself
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was called off after Johnson collapsed near the end of
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Harrells Academy is a private school with an enrollment of 340.
The school plays eight-man football.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches said Johnson, who was from Rose Hill, transferred to
Harrells Academy this year after attending Wallace-Rose Hill High
School the previous two years.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Reliever Carted Off Field  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Red Sox reliever Bryce Florie was struck in the
face with a sharp line drive, carted off the field with blood
streaming down and taken to a hospital Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The club wasn't expected to have a report on his condition until
Saturday, but team spokesman Kevin Shea said Florie appeared to be
hit under the right eye.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't look good,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Florie, hit by Ryan Thompson's liner in the ninth inning of the
New York Yankees' 4-0 win over Boston, never appeared to lose
consciousness and was taken to the Massachusetts Eye &AMP; Ear
Infirmary, a few miles from Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never seen someone hit that hard in the head,'' said
Boston catcher Jason Varitek, who rushed to the mound. ''It shifts
you away from worrying about the loss to worrying about our friend
and our teammate.''
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed Florie started lifting his glove but was struck
squarely with two outs in the inning. He immediately dropped to the
ground as the ball ricocheted to third baseman Lou Merloni, who
threw out Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Usually, when you hit a ball, you just take off,'' Thompson
said, ''but when I hit that one, I paused.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher lay face down, moving his outstretched legs in an
up-and-down motion as Boston manager Jimy Williams, trainer Jim
Rowe and several players from both teams surrounded him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never seen that, something like that, up close,'' Merloni
said in Boston's subdued clubhouse. ''To hear the sound I heard
from third base, it wasn't a good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   After about a minute, Florie sat up as the fans at Fenway Park
cheered. His right cheek, nose and upper lip were covered with
blood as he wiped it with a towel. At one point, Florie touched his
upper lip with his hand, apparently checking for damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was absolutely horrible,'' New York's Derek Jeter said.
''When you see something like that, you think it could be a
life-or-death situation, but it's part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   New York manager Joe Torre recalled the 1957 game in which
Yankees' infielder Gil McDougald hit a liner off the cheekbone of
Cleveland's Herb Score, the AL Rookie of the Year in 1955. Many
believe the accident shortened Score's career.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tonight, the first thing I remember was the horrible sound,''
Torre said. ''Then I saw Thompson coming to the dugout. I asked
him, 'What are you doing here?' And he pointed out to the field. It
was really ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Florie, 0-4 this season, entered the game with one out in the
ninth and runners at first and third. He got Clay Bellinger to hit
into a forceout at home, then walked Jose Vizcaino and allowed a
two-run single to Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who stayed in the game after pinch running for Paul
O'Neill in the eighth, then hit his wicked liner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the years I've seen guys get hit, but not like that, not
like that,'' Boston pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 8, Dodgers 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Todd Helton had three hits and scored three runs,
raising his batting average to .386 as the Colorado Rockies roughed
up Kevin Brown and the Los Angeles Dodgers 8-5 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield hit his 41st home run, breaking Mike Piazza's
1997 record for the most homers by a Los Angeles player. The
Dodgers' franchise mark is 43 by Brooklyn's Duke Snider in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Shumpert hit a two-run homer and Jeffrey Hammonds and Todd
Walker each had two hits and two RBIs for the Rockies. Los Angeles
lost its fourth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bohanon (9-9) allowed two earned runs and six hits in
seven innings. He is 4-1 in his last six starts.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (12-6), who had been 2-0 with an 0.56 ERA in two starts
against the Rockies this season, gave up five runs -- four earned --
and nine hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, Mark Grudzielanek and Dave Hansen hit solo home runs
for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds had an RBI double and Walker hit a two-run double in
the seventh, giving the Rockies an 8-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Beltre had a sacrifice fly in the Dodgers eighth and
Hansen homered in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield led off the fourth with a home run, tying it at 2.
Colorado regained the lead at 3-2 on Juan Pierre's two-out single
past Brown in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Shumpert extended the Rockies' lead to 5-2, homering into the
Dodgers bullpen in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: RHP Luke Prokopec will join the Dodgers rotation in Arizona
series which begins on Monday. ... Los Angeles committed its
NL-leading 122nd error. ... Rockies OF Larry Walker had a bone spur
and a piece of cartilage removed from his right elbow on Friday. He
is expected to be ready when the Rockies report for spring training
in February. ... Helton finished 3-for-5.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 7, Reds 3  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Alex Ramirez's two-run triple broke up a
scoreless game in the sixth inning and the Pittsburgh Pirates ran
their winning streak to eight, beating the Cincinnati Reds 3-1
Friday night to sweep a doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kendall doubled in two runs and Alex Hernandez hit his
first major league homer as the Pirates won the first game 7-3
behind Todd Ritchie's effective pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates had lost 31 of 46 and were 26 games below .500 with
the majors' worst record until starting their longest winning
streak since they won eight in a row Aug. 16-27, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, who have not been shut out in 142 games this season,
trailed 3-0 before Pokey Reese's two-out RBI single in the eighth
off rookie Matt Skrmetta, the fourth of the Pirates' five pitchers.
The Reds then pulled off their second double steal of the game, but
pinch-hitter Chris Stynes grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Villone (9-9) took a three-hit shutout into the sixth in
only his third start since July 22, only to get in trouble by
walking pinch-hitter Adrian Brown and hitting Pat Meares with a
pitch with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique Wilson struck out before Ramirez, acquired from
Cleveland with Wilson in the Wil Cordero trade, tripled to score
both runners. Keith Osik then fouled off a half-dozen pitches while
running the count to 3-2 before hitting a double that made it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates rookie Bronson Arroyo (3-5), ineffective in relief after
going 2-4 with a 6.55 ERA as a starter, pitched five shutout
innings in his first start since Aug. 6. He struck out four and
overcame three walks, striking out Villone with the bases loaded to
strand three runners in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Wilkins also was in trouble with runners on second and
third in the sixth, but Villone grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Williams, the Pirates' seventh pitcher, got the final out
for his 19th save in 24 chances.
</P>
<P>
   The doubleheader was the first between the two in Three Rivers
since Aug. 22, 1975, when the Pirates swept a Reds team that led
the NL West by 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie (8-7), one of the majors' best pitchers last September
with a 3-1 record and 2.93 ERA, won his second in a row this month
in the opener despite allowing Sean Casey's two-run homer. Ritchie
gave up three runs and five hits in six innings, leaving after
throwing 117 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kendall was in a 5-for-23 slump before getting hits in his
first three at-bats, including run-scoring doubles in the third and
fourth. The double in the fourth followed Hernandez's leadoff homer
to center that put the Pirates back in front, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds had tied it at 2 in the top of the fourth on Ken
Griffey Jr.'s leadoff single and Casey's 13th homer. Casey also
tripled with one out in the eighth and Pittsburgh up 4-3, but
reliever Scott Sauerbeck got Dmitri Young on a grounder and
pinch-hitter Mike Bell to pop up. The Pirates then scored three
runs against reliever John Riedling on Adrian Brown's double and
John Vander Wal's two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates, who had lost seven of eight before sweeping a
six-game California road trip, took a 1-0 lead in the second on
Scott Williamson's major league-leading 21st wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson (5-8), making his first since Aug. 23 because of
lower back spasms, pitched 3 2-3 innings, yielding four runs --
three earned -- and six hits while walking four. The Pirates' first
two runs resulted from walks by Williamson.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Pirates are 8-0 this month. They last had a winning
September in 1992. ... The doubleheader was the Reds' first of the
season. ... The Pirates have moved from last place to a third-place
tie with Milwaukee in the NL Central during their winning streak.
... The Pirates had split eight doubleheaders since sweeping the
Giants on Sept. 15, 1996. ... The Reds were swept for the second
time in their last 14 doubleheaders, with the other sweep coming
May 19, 1998, against the New York Mets. ... Pirates outfielder
Adam Hyzdu, an 11-year minor league veteran, singled in his first
major league at-bat in the second game. His number was retired this
week by Double-A Altoona. ... Reds reliever Mark Wohlers, who
walked four of six batters in his previous outing, retired the four
batters he faced in the second game.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Killed in Vegas Shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A tourist was killed Friday by a stray bullet
in a busy Las Vegas casino as security officers struggled with a
robbery suspect who opened fire, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The robbery suspect shot a guard in the stomach as officers
tried to handcuff him and fired another round that went through a
guard's pant leg and into the back of the victim, Heather M.
Vitarelli, 29, of Maui, authorities said. She had been standing
about 35 feet from the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Stephen Mullen, 32, and Michael Frimmel, 31.
They are being held on murder charges. The 43-year-old security
officer is hospitalized in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   Officers stopped the two men in Harrah's casino because they
matched the description of men who had stolen a customer's purse,
Police Lt. Wayne Petersen said. Mullen is accused of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The gun was stolen in Virginia and both men have prior arrest
records involving thefts and drugs, Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities did not provide the name for an attorney for Mullen
and Frimmel, and the two, who remain jailed at the Clark County
Detention Center, could not be reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Jenkin, senior vice president and general manager of
Harrah's Las Vegas hotel-casino, said ''we are deeply saddened by
this senseless tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second fatal shooting in a Las Vegas Strip casino
this year. In February, three shots were fired in the Stardust
hotel-casino's sports book. Philip M. Greenspan, 56, was shot in
the chest allegedly by an acquaintance and later died.

<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A man who described himself as a leftist
guerrilla prisoner hijacked a plane carrying 21 people Friday,
later freeing his captives unharmed when the plane touched down and
left him in rebel territory, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Three guards were escorting the prisoner from Bogota to the
southwest city of Florencia when he pulled a handgun and commandeer
the plane, said police director Gen. Ernesto Gilibert.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes into the flight after a refueling stop, the
prisoner went to the bathroom, emerged with a gun and headed for
the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said it was a hijacking, that it was to obtain his freedom
and that he was a guerrilla,'' said Jose Orlando Ossa, one of the
passengers aboard the Dash 230 turboprop run by the small Colombian
carrier Aires.
</P>
<P>
   Ossa spoke to reporters late Friday at the airport in Neiva, the
southwestern provincial city where the plane refueled and to which
it returned after its brief foray into guerrilla territory.
</P>
<P>
   Ossa said the hijacker identified himself as a member of
Colombia's largest guerrilla army, the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   Once on the ground at the FARC-held airport in the southern town
of San Vicente del Caguan, Ossa said the hijacker stepped off the
plane and a uniformed FARC member came aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC rebel ''asked for our forgiveness, saying that he had
no knowledge of this (the hijacking) and that we would all be able
to go free,'' Ossa added.
</P>
<P>
   Gilibert, the police chief, said the hijacker is a FARC rebel
who was serving a jail sentence in Bogota for killing a police
officer. The prisoner was being transferred from Bogota to
Florencia for a judicial proceeding, he added.
</P>
<P>
   A FARC spokesman confirmed the plane landed at the San Vicente
del Caguan airport, just south of Neiva, but denied the hijacker is
a member of the guerrilla organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a common criminal,'' FARC spokesman Andres Paris told
Colombia's RCN television station. ''This is not a guerrilla
action. This is not a FARC action.''
</P>
<P>
   Paris said the rebels had apprehended the hijacker, although it
was unclear whether they planned to turn him over to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacking could upset fragile peace talks between the FARC
and President Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
   San Vicente del Caguan is part of a a five-township southern
region that has been ceded to the FARC as part of the negotiations.
Troops and police are not allowed to enter the territory, about
twice the size of New Jersey, which military officials charge has
become a haven for criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's hijacking was the second this year by a prisoner being
escorted on a flight by federal prison guards.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a convicted murderer being transferred from one
prison to another hijacked at knife point a flight with 17
passengers aboard. In the bizarre incident, the man forced the
plane to land in a northern region rife with right-wing
paramilitary squads and was killed hours later by the militias.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Teams to Meet on Debates  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Advisers to George W. Bush and Al Gore are
ready to meet next week for the first time to negotiate details of
a fall series of televised debates between the presidential rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush late Friday dropped his insistence that the first encounter
be held Tuesday on a special 60-minute evening edition of NBC's
''Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   He told his campaign chairman, Don Evans, to contact the
Commission on Presidential Debates to tell it they were ready to
talk.
</P>
<P>
   That broke an impasse in the ''debate on the debates'' between
the two camps -- and all but assured there would be at least two
commission-sponsored confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   It came as Republican Bush, trying to stem a Gore advance in the
polls, worked to put his campaign back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush wants there to be debates, and believes the
American people are best served by having debates,'' said Bush's
communications director, Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are pleased that the Bush campaign has agreed to meet with
the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. We look forward
to that meeting.'' William Daley, Gore's campaign chairman, said
late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Brown, executive director of the commission, said in a
statement that the Bush campaign had accepted its invitation to
meet. ''We are working to schedule a meeting with Bush and Gore
campaigns representatives next week,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which has overseen all presidential debates
since 1988, recommended a series of three 90-minute prime-time
sessions, all in October.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had agreed to only one of those debates, but said he was
willing to do two other 60-minute encounters on individual network
interview shows -- next week on ''Meet the Press'' and later on
CNN's ''Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign balked, saying they would only go on those
shows if Bush agreed to the full set of commission debates.
</P>
<P>
   Because Gore had previously said he would debate Bush ''anytime,
anywhere,'' Bush attempted to portray the Democratic vice
president, an experienced debater, as seeking to duck the debates.
</P>
<P>
   However, some top Republicans saw that strategy as backfiring,
making Bush look like the reluctant debater.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, who campaigned with Bush on Friday
in Pittsburgh, told reporters Bush ''has made his point'' in
tweaking Gore on the debate, but that it now was time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been anxious to get the talk about debate negotiations
off center stage. Republicans concerned about Gore's surge in the
polls have complained the topic has been a distraction for the
campaign and for voters Bush is trying to reach.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility being discussed at Bush's Austin campaign
headquarters was accepting two commission-sponsored debates while
trying to secure a less formal, non-commission session to start off
the series.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hughes said the prospect of a debate next week was no
longer likely, nor did she believe there could be one before the
mid-September start of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, President Clinton and Republican challenger Bob Dole
held two debates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was spending the weekend on his central Texas ranch,
bringing with him a thick briefing book to help him prepare for the
eventual debates, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   He campaigns Monday and Tuesday in Florida and Missouri before
embarking on a West Coast swing.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bush exhibited a promised change in gears in his
campaign, spending more time with individuals and less in formal
settings.
</P>
<P>
   He shared coffee and spent more than an hour in face-to-face
politicking at a telecommunications-equipment factory near
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what I'm good at,'' Bush declared. ''I like meeting
people, my fellow citizens. I like interfacing with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he told supporters in Springfield, Mo., ''I look forward
to taking my case directly to the people of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   He had promised on Thursday to do more people-to-people
appearances in the face of criticism from some top Republicans that
he had not been energetic enough in countering Gore's rise in the
polls.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers Advice To Candidates  </HEADLINE>
By CLAUDE R. MARX
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The next time Rep. Ron Klink, D-Pa., airs
advertisements asking people to send him to the Senate, the unseen
hand of President Clinton will be there.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told me how to boil down issues for public consumption. On
Medicare, he told me to emphasize the impact on individuals,'' said
Klink, who is challenging first-term Republican Sen. Rick Santorum
in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking at a July reception here that netted the
four-term congressman $500,000, the president stayed at the hotel
for an extra 25 minutes to give Klink a tutorial in retail
politics, Clinton style.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Clinton gave Las Vegas lawyer Ed Bernstein a similar
lesson during a limousine ride. Bernstein, who has never sought
elective office before, is running for an open Senate seat against
former Rep. John Ensign, R-Nev.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told me 'Eddie, keep talking about the differences between
you and John Ensign. If you do that you'll win,' ''Bernstein said.
''After he gives speeches, he'll point out certain phrases he think
will be helpful in framing issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The advice has not given Bernstein the lead and the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee still does not rate the race as one
of the party's best opportunities to win.
</P>
<P>
   With no campaign of his own to worry about, Clinton has found a
new role for himself this year as political guru and strategist.
</P>
<P>
   While his top congressional priority is electing first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton to the Senate from New York, he has been
involved in races in California, Florida, Nevada and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who often edited and rewrote his own campaign ads, has
not limited himself to helping candidates craft their message. He
has tapped his knowledge of turnout trends to help candidates get
out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   He has spoken with Bill Nelson, the Democratic nominee for
Senate in Florida, about ways to encourage more Hispanics to vote,
according to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, the state insurance commissioner, is running for an open
seat against Republican Rep. Bill McCollum. Nelson leads in the
most recent Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel poll by 11 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   The president draws on his experience in running two winning
national campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ''He remembers how he did in many areas and told me how I can do
as well,'' said Klink. ''It kind of blew me away when he went
precinct by precinct and county by county and discussed how they
voted. That's why he has been intimately involved in campaign
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pittsburgh Tribune-Review poll released Friday showed Klink
trailing by 13 percentage points, but that's an improvement over
the 20 percentage-point gap in the Keystone Poll, released in July
by Millersville University.
</P>
<P>
   Klink predicts that the gap will narrow when he goes on the air
and takes some of Clinton's suggestions. He declined to discuss his
advertising strategy or timetable.
</P>
<P>
   University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato doubts
that Clinton's political skills are transferable.
</P>
<P>
   ''He knows politics as well or better than anyone, but his
skills are better suited for someone of his talents for others,''
Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato, who has written several books on campaign strategy, said
that because much of the public mistrusts Clinton, candidates could
suffer if they are too closely identified with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he has advice to give, he should do it in the wee hours
when no one is watching,'' Sabato added.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his new avocation as a campaign consultant, Clinton
devotes lots of time to raising money for candidates. He averages
about 12 events per month.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is our most effective fund-raiser; there is no Clinton
fatigue among donors,'' said Democratic National Chairman Ed
Rendell.

<HEADLINE> Government, Academics Mull Carnivore  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While the Justice Department decides which
group will perform an independent review of the much-criticized
''Carnivore'' e-mail surveillance system, Attorney General Janet
Reno says she wants to change the name of the tool to something a
little less threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The review, offered by the department as a way to calm privacy
concerns from the public and Congress, which has had several
hearings on the tool, will be performed by a group chosen by the
government, based on applications. The deadline for applications
expired Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But several prominent universities have denounced the review as
a rubber stamping, not an independent verification.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Perrine, manager of security technologies at the University
of California at San Diego's Supercomputer Center, said the
government reserves veto power over who is on the review team,
controls when and where the review will be issued and has the
ability to direct the contractor to make changes in the report.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be honest, we were pretty surprised by the restrictions,''
he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Perrine and his center has been joined by the University of
Michigan, Purdue University and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in shunning the review process.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials refused to specify what
organizations submitted an application, citing federal law that
prohibits revealing that information before a decision is made.
Spokeswoman Chris Watney would say only that there were multiple
submissions.
</P>
<P>
   Perrine also considered reviewing Carnivore under the ''Open
Carnivore'' project, a group of security professionals and
academics. He said his group was willing to review Carnivore for
free.
</P>
<P>
   But after looking at all the restrictions, he and his colleagues
decided against it. He said no one in the group -- which includes
representatives from AT&AMP;T, the University of California at
Berkeley, and Tsutomu Shimomura, who tracked down hacker Kevin
Mitnick -- showed any interest.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the application process, Perrine said he expects the
final choice, which does not have to be a university, to be a
Defense Department contractor. Then, he said, the review would be
highly suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his feelings, Perrine said he and his group don't think
the FBI is misusing Carnivore at all. He primarily wants to make
sure that the tool isn't vulnerable to outside manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of us really saw any ulterior motive in Carnivore. Every
single person in our group has dealt with law enforcement in the
past,'' he said. ''Law enforcement does have some legitimate access
to digital wiretaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnivore looks like a desktop computer, but contains tracking
software. In cases where authorities believe a suspect is using
e-mail, it is installed at the suspect's Internet service provider
where it scans through all incoming and outgoing messages. It
captures only e-mails going to or from the subject. It can also
scan other means of Internet communications, like Web browsing or
chat.
</P>
<P>
   Critics call Carnivore a ''black box'' whose technology is a
mystery to the public and to Internet service providers. The
Justice Department and the FBI, which says it has used the tool
about 25 times, say it has many safeguards to protect the privacy
of the provider's other customers.
</P>
<P>
   The government has resisted efforts by civil liberties groups to
make Carnivore's inner workings public, saying that would allow
criminals to circumvent the tool.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who has repeatedly showed her annoyance with the ominous
name, said during her weekly news conference Thursday that
Carnivore's name will be different after the review is finished.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the feeling is that we want to get the report, and see
what, if anything, needs to be done, and go to a second stage with
a new name,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Naseem Javed of ABC Namebank in New York, who helps corporations
come up with names and has published two books on the subject,
suggests a name with more empathy.
</P>
<P>
   His pick: ''Big Sister.''

Colombia Passenger Plane Hijacked
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A man described as a leftist guerrilla prisoner
hijacked a plane carrying 21 people Friday, later freeing his captives unharmed
when the plane dropped him in rebel territory, police said. Three guards were
escorting the prisoner from Bogota to the southwest city of Florencia when he
managed to pull a handgun and commandeer the plane, police director Gen. Ernesto
Gilibert said. He said it wasn't clear how the hijacker got a hold of a weapon.
The hijacking occurred when the Dash 230 turboprop was making a refueling stop
at the airport in Neiva, a provincial city southwest of Bogota. It was on a
flight from Bogota to the city of Florencia.

Five days after truckers across France began a blockade of oil refineries and

than usual. Measurements of ozone depletion vary from year-to-year, making it
difficult for scientists to determine the long-term environmental impact of
changes in the ozone layer. Still, this year's hole caught atmospheric experts
off-guard. That was the biggest ever, beating the previous record of 10.5

<HEADLINE> Chief Defends Missile Defense  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon's chief of missile defense says
he sees ''no technical reason'' why an effective defense against
ballistic missile attack on the United States cannot be built.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Lt. Gen. Ronald Kadish, director of the Ballistic
Missile Defense Organization, told a House panel Friday he was
optimistic that further testing of missile defense will show it can
be made to work.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke publicly on the subject for the first time since
President Clinton announced a week earlier that he decided to put
off deployment of missile defenses, in part because of doubts about
the technical feasibility.
</P>
<P>
   Kadish said his office provided technical information about the
project's status and prospects as part of the Pentagon's input to
Clinton's decision, but it made no recommendation on whether to
proceed or to defer deployment.
</P>
<P>
   The president said Sept. 1 he would leave a deployment decision
to his successor because he was not convinced the technology is at
hand to build a reliable anti-missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should not move forward until we have absolute confidence
that the system will work,'' Clinton said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was an emerging threat of long-range missile
attack on the United States, but he did not believe the benefits of
extra security from a missile shield would outweigh diplomatic
difficulties with countries like Russia and China, which oppose the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Kadish, in his appearance before the House Government Reform
subcommittee on national security, did not comment directly on his
view of Clinton's decision. But in his written testimony he made
clear he believes some critics of national missile defense are
underestimating the Pentagon's technical prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no technical reason at this point, validated by
independent review teams, indicating that we could not develop an
effective NMD (national missile defense) system,'' Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
   The three-star general addressed one of the major criticisms of
the system now under development -- that it cannot cope with the
kinds of decoys and other countermeasures that hostile nations
might use to overcome it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given our extensive toolbox and the 40 years of experience the
United States has with offensive and defensive weapon systems, we
know how to play the countermeasures/counter-countermeasures
game,'' Kadish said. ''And we know how to win.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that despite setbacks and delays in the development and
testing of a national missile defense, 93 percent of the system's
''critical engagement functions'' have been demonstrated to work
properly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had planned to be at about 94 percent at this stage, so we
are very nearly where we expected to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The last two major tests, in which prototype interceptor rockets
failed to hit their target in space, were disappointments, Kadish
said, but they are not evidence of insurmountable technological
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problems are fixable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The next test was scheduled for November, but the Pentagon said
earlier this week that it probably would be delayed until January
because analysis of the results from July's failed test is still
under way.
</P>
<P>
   Also at Friday's hearing, the Pentagon's head watchdog on
weapons testing submitted a schedule chart, dated September 2000,
which said the next test would not happen until March 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Coyle, the Defense Department's director of operational
test and evaluation, said the tests need to be made more realistic
in order to show that the system would work reliably.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such a capability is yet to be shown to be practicable for
NMD,'' Coyle said, explaining later under questioning that by
''practicable'' he meant ''that you could count on it'' in an
actual missile attack.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- South Korea's president has disputed reports of
growing anti-American sentiment in his country, but warned of that
possibility if the two governments don't quickly update a U.S.
armed forces agreement and deal with other military-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a Korea Society dinner at the conclusion of the U.N.
Millennium Summit, President Kim Dae-jung said a key complaint was
the lack of progress in negotiations to revise the armed forces
pact -- called the Status of Forces Agreement, or SOFA -- to make it
equal to those with Japan and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said other issues were recent claims of U.S. troops killing
a large number of civilians during the Korean War as well as a
pollution scandal involving the American military.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is frustration and criticism over the slow progress in
the work of revising the agreement, the reported killing of No Gun
Ri villagers during the Korean War and environmental pollution at
some U.S. military installations,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I fear is that if the problems are left to fester, they
could be exploited by the very few who are against the United
States to expand their influence. Lest that happen, we must bring
these issues to a very prompt and convincing resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   About 37,000 American troops are stationed in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries began talks last month on updating the
1960s-era SOFA pact, a key element being a Korean demand for
immediate legal custody of American service personnel accused of
crimes. At present the U.S. command keeps custody until a
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials point out that Status of Forces pacts in
Germany and Japan give local judicial systems this right, and
consider it discriminatory that Korea's does not. The United States
traditionally resists subjecting its personnel to foreign judicial
systems that do not contain the same protections as American laws.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said he believed the call for a change in the South Korean
SOFA was ''reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is criticism and a demand, not an expression of
anti-Americanism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ''absolute majority of the Korean people'' share his
appreciation for the ''abiding friendship and support'' of the
United States, said the 74-year-old Kim, a one-time political
dissident who was imprisoned by South Korea's authoritarian
governments in the early 1980s and spent part of two years under a
death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and South Korean governments are investigating claims,
first reported by The Associated Press last year, that Korean
civilians had been killed by U.S. troops at No Gun Ri in July 1950,
in the early days of the Korean War. Former soldiers spoke of 100,
200 or simply hundreds dead. The South Koreans say up to 300 were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The pollution controversy stems from a U.S. base's dumping of a
formaldehyde solution into Seoul's Han river through a sewage
conduit.

<HEADLINE> Harry Potter Translations Sought  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- It doesn't take any magic to conjure up the latest
book about Harry Potter in a store just about anywhere these days.
Fans of the young wizard are clamoring to get their hands on it in
countries around the world -- even before it's translated.
</P>
<P>
   Potter-mania has struck from Denmark to Thailand, sending
''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' flying off the shelves. The
English version even made it to No. 1 on German online bookstore
buecher.de.
</P>
<P>
   Some German fans got a bit overeager waiting for the translation
that hits the market here next month. One fan Web site proposed a
translation contest from English of the fourth book in the series,
drawing threats of legal action by the Potter books' German
publishers, Hamburg-based Carlsen.
</P>
<P>
   But even the English versions are hot items. In the Dussmann
bookstore in central Berlin, the English-language version of
''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' is the only
foreign-language book to be showcased in the children's section.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've read the first three books in German already and I'm
thinking about reading the new one if my English is good enough,''
said one Potter fan, Susanne Volkmuth, 39, of Mainz, who was
perusing the aisles at Dussmann.
</P>
<P>
   In Denmark, where a Danish translation will be released in the
fall, the English version of the book is also moving fast.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been selling thousands of copies of the English
version both to young and old people,'' said Kjeld Bonderup, head
of Gad, Denmark's largest chain of booksellers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the greatest children's book success in recent years,''
he said, but refused to give an exact sales figure because of
company policy.
</P>
<P>
   At Finland's largest bookstore, Academic Bookstore in Helsinki,
managers ordered several hundred copies of the English version but
only 100 arrived -- all of which sold out immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The English versions of the fourth ''Harry Potter'' book also
sold well in Thailand, helping the translated copy of the first
book to make it to No. 1 on the best-seller list within two weeks
of its release last month.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomsbury Publishing in London, publisher of the U.K. editions,
did not respond to repeated queries about sales figures for the
English-language version in non-English-speaking countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the German publisher Carlsen said it's sold more than 2
million copies of the German-language Harry Potter books since the
first one went on sale in fall 1998 -- with a boost coming most
recently when the fourth book came out in English.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Cornelia Berger said that while on tour with author
J.K. Rowling through Germany in March, at least 10 to 20 percent of
books Potter fans asked the author to sign were English versions.
</P>
<P>
   Educators in the western German state of Saarland have even said
they would stock the English version in school libraries to help
students learn the language. But they won't be able to take the
book home: Because of the novel's popularity, readers will only be
allowed to read it during library hours.

<HEADLINE> Angels 2, Orioles 1  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Ramon Ortiz pitched out of his recent
slump with 7 2-3 strong innings, and Benji Gil homered Friday night
as the Anaheim Angels downed the Baltimore Orioles 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz (5-5) held the Orioles to one run on three hits. The
rookie struck out five and walked four in winning for the first
time in six starts dating back to Aug. 8, when he beat Boston and
Pedro Martinez 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival pitched the ninth for his 27th in 36 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Gil's solo shot to right-center field in the sixth inning off
Pat Rapp (7-11) provided the go-ahead run. His opposite-field homer
was his sixth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Richard had drawn the Orioles even in the fifth with his
eighth homer, a one-out drive over the fence in center on a 3-1
pitch from Ortiz.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim took its first lead in the second. Bengie Molina singled
with one out and moved up on Adam Kennedy's single, his first of
three for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Molina then scored when Darin Erstad's grounder up the middle
skipped just past the outstretched glove of diving second baseman
Jerry Hairston for a single.
</P>
<P>
   After his spectacular win over Boston, Ortiz lost three of his
next six starts. He was rocked for nine runs on eight hits in his
last previous outing, although he got no decision in the Angels'
13-12 loss to the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Holtz relieved with a runner on second and two outs in the
eighth and ended the inning by getting Brady Anderson on a pop fly.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp gave up two runs on six hits in six innings. He struck out
two, walked three and hit a batter as he lost for the fifth time in
his last seven starts.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a victory at Cleveland last Sunday, he was trying to
win consecutive starts for the first time since April.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles again were without slugger Albert Belle, who was
examined by doctors in Baltimore on Wednesday and is listed as
day-to-day with inflammation in his right hip.
</P>
<P>
   Belle has missed four games because of the injury. He is batting
just .215 in his last 39 games and has only four homers in his past
59 games.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Angels announced they have agreed to terms with RHP
Chris Bootcheck, who was the team's second pick in the first round
of the 2000 free agent draft, the 28th player taken. He had a 9-2
record and 3.76 ERA for Auburn last season. His father, Dan, played
in the Detroit Tigers' organization from 1966-73. ... When RHP Luis
Rivera makes his Orioles debut, he will be their 50th player of the
year, a club high. He also will be their 22nd pitcher of the
season, which is tied for the second most in club history. ... The
Angels' Mo Vaughn was back at first base after being the DH in the
two previous games because of a sore left ankle. He went 1-for-4.

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Subsiding in Montana  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN GALLAGHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARBY, Mont. (AP) -- Montana's summer of fire is winding down,
but it will be a long time until Charlotte Zikan can resume life as
she knew it before flames reduced the house where she lived for 25
years to charred rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Foresters have told Zikan it will be a year and a half before
she'll know whether the hillside behind the rubble is stable enough
for her to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a waiting game,'' Zikan, 62, said this week as she picked
through the blackened bed frames, pieces of pottery, and nails
among the debris of her house in southwestern Montana's Bitterroot
Valley. Now, she is staying with friends.
</P>
<P>
   As firefighters move out of Montana and on to other
wildfire-ravaged Western states, there is no shipping out and no
immediate forecast of normalcy for Zikan and hundreds of others
whose lives were thrown into disarray.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross says recovering from the fire catastrophe
will be different from the aftermath of other natural disasters,
because people are having to keep their lives on hold longer.
</P>
<P>
   ''A tornado comes and a tornado goes,'' said Bob Howard, Red
Cross spokesman in Missoula. ''People know the extent of the damage
and what they have to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many unknowns in the aftermath of the Montana
wildfires, which began in July and had blackened 935,700 acres as
of Friday. Hit hardest was the Bitterroot area, where 64 homes were
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Blazes that ripped through trees and other protective cover on
slopes, may have left unstable land behind. The health effects of
prolonged exposure to smoke for residents with respiratory problems
will not be known for months. And with several weeks remaining in
the fire season, there is a risk new blazes will erupt or the
ongoing fires will flare up.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been hard on a lot of people, physically and
emotionally,'' said Gretchen Serwacki, who was evacuated for a full
month.
</P>
<P>
   Serwacki and her husband were allowed to return home when the
last of the Bitterroot evacuation orders ended on Tuesday. But
their homecoming was delayed when they learned their place had
septic-tank problems, apparently caused by the removal of trees.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think we're blessed that we still have our house,'' said
Serwacki, who has been living in a campground motorhome.
</P>
<P>
   Foresters, soil scientists, fire experts and others are
assessing the intensity of the fires from one place to another.
Measures to rehabilitate the land will vary with severity of the
burning, said Jack Kendley, a Forest Service spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The study of the fires' intensity will provide information for
managers of public lands and for private landowners like Zikan.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Zikan's pine trees died in the fire, as did her small
fruit orchard. Some blackened apples still hang on branches and
others are scattered about the ground, like charcoal briquettes
dumped from a barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   The backyard fruit is replaceable, but so many other things are
not: Zikan's baby book, her late father's billfold. ''I don't think
I have any record of my mother's handwriting,'' she said. ''You
don't think about things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   When the fire hit her house on Aug. 6, Zikan was at a wedding.
She had removed two carloads of belongings, after being told the
house was in harm's way, yet she still thought it would still be
intact when she came back.
</P>
<P>
   ''What fireplace is not left standing?'' she said Wednesday as
she paused amid the rubble, where only the living room fireplace
remained.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Zikan is optimistic about her prospects of picking
up the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two years from now, this will be nice and green.''

<HEADLINE> 100 Injured After China Explosion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with hospitals receiving
casualties, witness comment; CORRECT time of explosion. No pickup.
BEIJING (AP) -- A truck carrying explosives blew up in China's
restive Muslim northwest, killing or injuring 100 people and
scorching nearby vehicles and homes, officials and state media said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Xinhua News Agency reported 100 casualties in the explosion
Friday night in Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang region, but it gave
no breakdown of the dead and injured. Officials with the city
police and government refused to comment either on the casualties
or the explosion's cause.
</P>
<P>
   Police and paramilitary units cleared the wreckage through the
night, sending the injured to at least four area hospitals,
government and medical officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coal Mining Hospital received three dead and was treating 90
injured, some of whom were permanently blinded or crippled by the
explosion, said an emergency room administrator who only gave his
surname, Chen.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion occurred around 5:30 p.m. on a major artery in the
sprawling industrial city's western suburbs that was crowded with
residents leaving work. Xinhua said the truck was taking the
explosives for disposal when they detonated. It added that more
than 20 vehicles and homes were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a boom and saw black smoke in the sky,'' said an
employee at the Materials Transport Co., also surnamed Chen. He ran
more than a mile from his office to the site.
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw dead and injured people, too numerous to count,
lying on the road and sidewalk. He also said the truck that
apparently carried the explosives was a military vehicle, although
government officials refused to confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   Explosives are widely available for construction in fast-growing
China and accidents are common. But Xinjiang is also the scene of
the most violent internal threat faced by China's communist
government.
</P>
<P>
   Uighurs, Turkic Muslims who are the region's largest ethnic
group, have long resisted Chinese rule. Since the mid-1990s,
militant Uighurs have waged a campaign of bombings and
assassinations against Chinese and suspected collaborators. China
launched a crackdown in 1996 that has failed to quell the unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Urumqi, a largely Chinese city, has seen few separatist attacks.
But in one of the most coordinated acts of violent protest,
militants exploded bombs nearly simultaneously on three buses in
the city in 1997, killing nine and injuring 68.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Rebels Won't Free Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels backed out on a
promise to free on Friday all six European hostages they have held
for months in the Philippine jungle, making a partial offer that
forced the government to cancel the entire release, an official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf rebel leader Ghalib ''Robot'' Andang informed a
mediator that he would only free three of the Europeans,
negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   Two go-betweens on their way to meet with the Muslim rebels were
ambushed Saturday, officials said. Five of their bodyguards were
injured and one was killed, they said. The go-betweens were
believed to be carrying a large ransom for the Europeans' release.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred about three miles from where the hostages
are being held, military reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials blamed the attack on another Abu Sayyaf rebel
faction. Authorities have reported growing tensions within the Abu
Sayyaf over the sharing of millions of dollars in ransom they have
reportedly received for previous hostage releases.
</P>
<P>
   Chief government hostage negotiator Robert Aventajado said the
two go-betweens were not injured and were trying to secure the
release of the hostages. He warned the military not to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are still on top of the situation and there is no need for
military action,'' Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado said he attempted to convince Andang that an attack
was unlikely as long as the rebels are holding another group of 12
Filipino Christian evangelists.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how long a delay would result from the latest
setbacks. A mediator headed to the jungle carried with him a new
satellite phone to replace one the rebel leader broke in a fit of
anger Friday, a member of the negotiating panel said. The phone is
used for contacts between Andang and Aventajado.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels are still holding two Finns, a French and
a German kidnapped April 23 from a Malaysian diving resort. They
are also holding two French television journalists and 12 Filipino
Christian evangelists who visited their camp in early July.
</P>
<P>
   On southern Jolo island, where the hostages are being held, a
junior Abu Sayyaf officer said the real reason for the failure of
Friday's release was that Andang was not ready to let go of his
foreign hostages, apparently because of fears of a military attack
once he does.
</P>
<P>
   A shortage of ransom money may also have contributed to the
delay, an official close to the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   A separate faction is holding an American, Jeffrey Schilling,
who was kidnapped early last week.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, 24, a Muslim convert from Oakland, California, was
seized Aug. 28 when he visited an Abu Sayyaf camp with his Filipino
Muslim wife, Ivi Osani. Osani, who is Sabaya's second cousin, was
not abducted.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have not announced their demands for Schilling's
release, although Sabaya has privately demanded $10 million,
negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels say they believe Schilling was spying on them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't believe this guy is a Muslim because he does many
things we can't accept as Muslims,'' Sabaya said in an interview
with the Radio Mindanao Network. ''For example, when he prays he
does not wash his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabaya reiterated the group's threat to kill Schilling if the
Philippine government does not respond favorably to its demands.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Concerts Aim For $7M  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Al Gore, looking ahead to a $7 million week of
fund raising with the stars, tried to stir campaign contributors
with a warning: ''The other side has pulled out all the stops.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential nominee beseeched donors at a
reception Friday night to help him even the financial score with
rival George W. Bush and the Republican Party, which have raised
record amounts for this election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you could just help us remain in the same ballpark, even
close, then that's what we need,'' Gore told about 250 people who
paid $1,000 apiece to see him in an over-air-conditioned hotel
ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   All year, the Democratic National Committee has trailed the
Republican National Committee in fund raising and Bush has raised a
staggering $100 million. The GOP nominee spent a record $93 million
through the end of July -- more than double Gore's expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other side has pulled out all the stops and just gone way
beyond what anybody ever thought would happen in the post-Watergate
reform era,'' Gore said at the Atlanta reception.
</P>
<P>
   Before returning to Washington for a weekend off at home, Gore
asked contributors at a $750,000 dinner to spread the word. ''I
want you to also encourage others to get on this cause and help us
push it forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Through June 30, the GOP had $21.1 million in hard cash in the
bank, compared with $9.3 million for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, both parties have spent millions on an unusually
early and aggressive TV ad war.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will help the DNC replenish its coffers next week -- in
between campaign stops focused on education -- with a trifecta of
benefit concerts that one member of his campaign entourage has
dubbed ''Moolah-palooza.''
</P>
<P>
   Singers Cher and Michael Bolton star at Tuesday's $800,000 gig
in Philadelphia. On Wednesday, it's singer James Taylor in Boston
to raise $1 million. The Thursday finale, at New York's Radio City
Music Hall, employs the likes of Bette Midler, Jon Bon Jovi, Paul
Simon and Julia Roberts to bag the week's biggest tally -- $5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, will separately do
his part with a $1.5 million marathon of four fund raisers Monday
in Bush's Texas.

Bush, Gore Teams to Meet on Debates
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Advisers to George W. Bush and Al Gore are ready to
meet next week for the first time to negotiate details of a fall series of
televised debates between the presidential rivals. Bush late Friday dropped his
insistence that the first encounter be held Tuesday on a special 60-minute
evening edition of NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' That broke an impasse in the
''debate on the debates'' between the two camps -- and all but assured there
would be at least two commission-sponsored confrontations.

Colombia Passenger Plane Hijacked
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A man described as a leftist guerrilla prisoner
hijacked a plane carrying 21 people Friday, later freeing his captives unharmed
when the plane dropped him in rebel territory, police said. Three guards were
escorting the prisoner from Bogota to the southwest city of Florencia when he
managed to pull a handgun and commandeer the plane, police director Gen. Ernesto
Gilibert said. He said it wasn't clear how the hijacker got a hold of a weapon.
The hijacking occurred when the Dash 230 turboprop was making a refueling stop
at the airport in Neiva, a provincial city southwest of Bogota. It was on a
flight from Bogota to the city of Florencia.

tried to handcuff him and fired another round that went through a guard's pant
leg and into the back of the victim, Heather M. Vitarelli, 29, of Maui,
authorities said. Police arrested Stephen Mullen, 32, and Michael Frimmel, 31.
They are being held on murder charges. The 43-year-old security officer is

French Fuel Still Scarce
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LYON, France (AP) -- In car after car, impatient drivers smoked, read the
paper or bickered with line-jumpers Friday as they waited to fill their tanks at
the only gas station open for regular business in France's third-largest city.
Five days after truckers across France began a blockade of oil refineries and
depots to protest high fuel prices, Lyon is one of the worst-hit cities, with
flights canceled and almost every drop of gasoline reserved for emergency
vehicles. Since Monday, the protesters have drawn international attention to the
difficulties they face as world fuel prices soar.

U.N.: Ozone Hole Opening Up Quickly
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The hole in the ozone layer is now three times larger than the
United States -- its biggest size ever, scientists at NASA said Friday. U.N.
weather experts said the hole over the Antarctic is growing earlier in the year
than usual. Measurements of ozone depletion vary from year-to-year, making it
difficult for scientists to determine the long-term environmental impact of
changes in the ozone layer. Still, this year's hole caught atmospheric experts
off-guard. That was the biggest ever, beating the previous record of 10.5
million square miles on Sept. 19, 1998.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Summit Closes With Resolution  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With a bang of a gavel and a round of
applause, more than 150 world leaders wrapped up their Millennium
Summit with promises to send every child to school and deliver
hundreds of millions of people from destitution by the year 2015.
</P>
<P>
   The historic summit to launch the United Nations in the third
millennium ended at 8:01 p.m. Friday with significantly less
fanfare than it began, as many of the presidents and prime
ministers had already headed home to rest after three days of
intensive speech-making and diplomatic shoulder-rubbing.
</P>
<P>
   But the anticlimax was almost appropriate as the summit closed
with a stern warning from Secretary-General Kofi Annan that the
promises the leaders made in an eight-page Millennium Declaration
not remain words on paper.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have sketched out clear directions for adapting this
organization to its role in the new century,'' Annan said. ''But
ultimately you are yourselves the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It lies in your power, and therefore it is your responsibility
to reach the goals that you have defined.''
</P>
<P>
   In the declaration, the world leaders made a commitment to a new
agenda for the 21st century -- with a lofty goal of promoting
democracy, strengthening human rights, ending wars and ensuring
that all 6 billion inhabitants of planet Earth share in its wealth
and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   One goal though -- peace -- eluded Israel and the Palestinians
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak had a brief encounter Friday
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, urging him to reach a peace
agreement before time runs out.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was unresponsive, Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   ''No good,'' the Israeli leader told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   But the United Nations itself sought to make peace with irate
New Yorkers, who endured three days of traffic jams and street
closings to accommodate the largest ever gathering of world leaders
-- and the accompanying protests they brought.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank You NY,'' will be spelled out using office lights on
both sides of the glass-encased U.N. headquarters building on
Sunday and Monday evenings ''for all that New Yorkers have put up
with this week,'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The secretary-general is aware that there was a great deal of
disruption in the lives of ordinary citizens, but he hopes that
they are proud of this reaffirmation that their city, and ours, is
truly the capital of the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He would like to thank the people of New York for their
courtesy, understanding and support,'' Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   In the summit declaration, the leaders promise major changes and
set tough targets -- to cut in half the proportion of people living
on less than $1 a day, and the number of people who do not have
safe drinking water, by the year 2015.
</P>
<P>
   By that date, they also pledged that boys and girls everywhere
will be able to complete primary school, and that the spread of
HIV/AIDS and the scourge of malaria and other major diseases should
be halted and reversed.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration commits world leaders to improve the lives of at
least 100 million slum dwellers by 2020, and to close the so-called
digital divide by working to make the fruits of globalization
available to the poor as well as the rich.
</P>
<P>
   There were some parts of the declaration that did not please the
United States, though they were included in the final document.
Among them was a provision calling upon the world's wealthy
countries to cancel all the official debts of the poorest countries
and to adopt policies of duty-free and quota-free access for
exports from the least developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also expressed reservations about several
other aspects, including a call to convene an international
conference ''to identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers'' and
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Annan praised the leaders for committing themselves to such
concrete pledges.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am struck by the remarkable convergence of views on the
challenge that faces us,'' Annan said. ''And by the urgency of your
call to action.''

<HEADLINE> Jamaican PM Touts Anti-Crime Plan  </HEADLINE>
By IAN JAMES
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jamaica's prime minister is seeking to reassure
business leaders and government officials that his country will
handle a rising tide of violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Friday at the Americas Society, Prime Minister P.J.
Patterson outlined his government's new plan aimed at easing
violence and stemming the flow of drugs and guns. More than 600
people have been murdered this year on the Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have reason to be concerned,'' Patterson said. ''We are
determined to ensure that our beautiful country is a safe place.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister, who visited New York this week to attend the
U.N. Millennium Summit, told an audience of about 100 people that
the centerpiece of his new anti-crime plan is ''the creation of an
elite strike force, led and manned by the best of our security
forces.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that freedom from fear of violence contributes
meaningfully to an environment that is conducive to investment and
higher levels of economic growth,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamaican economy has shrunk 4.2 percent since 1996, and
although unemployment is officially running at 16.3 percent, the
true figure is estimated to be between 20 percent and 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both local and foreign businesses have complained recently about
Jamaica's high crime rate. The island's leading entrepreneur,
Gordon Stewart, who owns Sandals Resorts International chain and
Air Jamaica, recently said he might leave the country if the crime
situation doesn't improve.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech, Patterson outlined what he said were economic
improvements during his tenure and said the country is seeking
investment to boost growth.
</P>
<P>
   But he also expressed concern about the increasing globalization
of the world economy, describing it as a ''brand new ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Its advent has not produced equal benefits to all the nations
of the Earth, and in several instances has so far only served to
entrench age-old interests and widen previous disparities,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other representatives of small nations expressed similar worries
in New York this week.
</P>
<P>
   Haitian President Rene Preval on Thursday spoke of ''a new
source of inequality and divisions among nations'' and warned that
a widening gap between the rich and the poor could lead to a
''social explosion.''

<HEADLINE> E. Timor Sends Four To Olympics  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- They will stand out because of where
they march and what they wear, all in white and identified only as
international athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, where it's no longer possible or even safe to train,
the people of East Timor will know who they are and where they come
from. And every step taken by these four competitors from the
world's newest nation will be followed like a marching band on the
Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   ''These four athletes are seen as big heroes,'' said Frank
Fowlie, the leader of the team without a country about to make a
historic debut on the world's biggest stage.
</P>
<P>
   Marathon runners Aguida Amaral and Calisto Da Costa,
weightlifter Martinho De Araujo and boxer Victor Ramos will march
into Sydney's Olympic Stadium in Friday's opening ceremony as
anonymous as can be. Because East Timor lacks a national Olympic
committee, it can't send a team to the games.
</P>
<P>
   But in recognition of the bravery and sacrifices the athletes
made through last year's unrest following East Timor's independence
vote, the International Olympic Committee agreed to allow a small
group from the island north of Australia to compete in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes, accompanied by four coaches, will march ahead of
the host nation under the Olympic flag, a white banner with five
interlocked rings. Their uniforms will be all white, and their
affiliation will be officially listed as IOA -- International
Olympic Athlete.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second time this has happened. In 1992, the IOC made
similar provisions for athletes from Yugoslavia, then banned from
most international activities because of the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Fowlie said Saturday that officials were trying to complete a TV
deal so people in Dili, the East Timor capital, could watch the
ceremony and some of the Olympic action.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's probably going to viewed as the biggest story of
the last 14 months there,'' he said. ''The athletes are going to be
seen as doing something that is very, very important and happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Olympic Association has played host to the East
Timorese in Darwin for the past two months, where they have trained
away from the dangers at home. East Timor has calmed down under
United Nations protection, while violence involving militias
opposed to independence from Indonesia has moved to West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Fowlie said the athletes probably know little of what is going
on back home, since there is no news media in Australia that works
in their language.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are here to compete,'' he said. ''They are here as
individual athletes at the games.''

<HEADLINE> Indiana Investigating Knight Again  </HEADLINE>
By REX W. HUPPKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- ''Honk If You Love Coach Knight.''
</P>
<P>
   As the latest Bob Knight controversy settled across the Indiana
University campus Friday, two students hung that sign outside their
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   There was much honking, even though the heavily scrutinized
basketball coach was accused of forcefully grabbing a 19-year-old
freshman by the arm and cursing him.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation, which occurred Thursday, was the first
involving Knight since he was issued a zero-tolerance warning back
in May. The coach says the claims are inaccurate, that he just gave
the teen-ager a lecture about manners while holding his arm.
</P>
<P>
   The question university officials face is whether Knight's
conduct -- be it grabbing the arm or holding it -- constitutes
''inappropriate physical contact,'' an action the zero-tolerance
policy says will be cause for immediate termination.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have to be an absolute moron -- an absolute moron --
with the things that have been laid on me to grab a kid in public,
or curse at a kid in public, as apparently it's been said that I
did,'' Knight said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Shaw, the stepfather of 19-year-old freshman Kent Harvey,
claims Knight confronted his stepson Thursday at Assembly Hall.
After the teen greeted him with, ''Hey, what's up, Knight?'' Shaw,
a former Bloomington radio talk-show host and vocal critic of
Knight, said the coach took the freshman by the arm and whirled him
around.
</P>
<P>
   He said Knight grabbed the teen so hard that the coach's
fingernails broke the skin of Harvey's arm.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a freshman in his 10th day of classes, he didn't deserve
this,'' Shaw said. ''Even the most ardent Knight supporter is going
to have a tough time with this one.''
</P>
<P>
   But Knight and assistant basketball coach Mike Davis described
the encounter much differently.
</P>
<P>
   Knight said he and the student crossed through a doorway going
into Assembly Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'Son, my name is not Knight to you. It's Coach Knight
or it's Mr. Knight. I don't call people by their last name, and
neither should you,''' Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought he was teaching Harvey some manners, and his
voice never rose.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is what happened and that's entirely what happened and
any deviation from that is absolutely inaccurate -- completely
inaccurate,'' Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   He also called it an ''interesting coincidence'' that the
student was a stepson ''of a guy who over the years has probably
been the most vitriolic critic I've had.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 fans who gathered outside during the news
conference erupted into cheers as the coach walked out.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey said he addressed Knight ''on the spur of a moment'' as
they were passing each other.
</P>
<P>
   ''I called him by his last name and he blew up,'' he said in an
interview with Indianapolis television station WRTV. ''I froze. I
didn't know what to say. I didn't know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   With Kent Harvey were two brothers -- Kyle and Kevin Harvey -- and
two friends.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Harvey told the television station he first thought Knight
was joking with his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ''But he was serious and he was in Kent's face,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who saw the confrontation, said there was no violence and
no profanity from Knight. ''He never said a curse word, he never
raised his voice,'' the assistant said.
</P>
<P>
   University police said Kent Harvey and witnesses to the incident
were interviewed Friday, and IU spokesman Christopher Simpson said
the university considers the matter ''extraordinarily serious.''
</P>
<P>
   When university president Myles Brand detailed the
zero-tolerance policy in May, he said, ''any verified,
inappropriate physical contact with players, members of the
university community or others in connection with the coach's
employment at IU will be cause for immediate termination.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They (the police) are continuing the investigation,'' Simpson
said late Friday. ''As soon as it's complete, we'll get the results
and we'll move on from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Following a series of accusations earlier this year that Knight
verbally and sometimes physically abused players, the university
suspended him for three games and fined him $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   The school also said the coach has to follow a supervised code
of conduct, which it has yet to fully detail.

<HEADLINE> Barrett Shoots Course-Record 63  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUTZTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Tina Barrett has a lot of things on her
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just moved about two weeks ago, and then the Solheim Cup,
and also we are starting to think about having a family, so there
is a lot going on,'' Barrett said after breaking the course record
to take a first-round lead Friday in the First Union Betsy King
Classic. ''I kind of feel that I am in the crossroads right now in
my life. This year has been a struggle. I think I shot 64 three
times last year, and this year, my lowest score so far has been 68,
so I needed to go low.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett shot a 9-under-par 63 to take a 3-stroke lead over Jean
Bartholomew, breaking the Berkleigh record of 65 held by Laura
Davies, Dale Eggling and Kelly Robbins. Barrett had nine birdies
and hit all 18 greens in regulation in the lowest score of her
career.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really believed in myself today and I played great,'' she
said. ''I suppose when you birdie half of the holes out there, it
is hard to complain too much.''
</P>
<P>
   She played the back nine in 5-under 30.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got more aggressive as the day went on, and I really started
to feel good about myself,'' said Barrett, who won the 1989 Ocean
State Open for her lone title in 12 years on the LPGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Bartholomew, second with a 66, was coming off a season-best
sixth-place finish in the Rail Classic, played in foggy morning
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was really stiff out there this morning when I started
because it was a little cold out,'' Bartholomew said. ''I was able
to hit the ball good off the tee and keep it in play.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't see my tee shots this morning because of the fog on
the first two holes.''
</P>
<P>
   She made five birdies in a front-nine 31, holing a 30-foot putt
on the ninth hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that the hard work is just beginning to pay off,''
Bartholomew said. ''Things haven't been too bad lately. I know that
I have missed a few cuts, but it has only been by a few shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Meg Mallon and Sara Sanders opened with 67s, and defending
champion Hy Yung Kim was another stroke back, along with Kristi
Albers, Michele Redman and Maggie Will.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Heatherington, the 1998 winner, shot a 71, and tournament
host Betsy King opened with a 72.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Benz had a hole-in-one on the 143-yard 16th hole. She also
finished with a 72.

<HEADLINE> Australia Denies Olympic Officials  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- In a rebuff to the IOC, the Australian
government will not reconsider its decision to bar two Asian
Olympic officials linked to alleged criminal activity from entering
the country for the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''The paramount consideration is for safety and the security of
the Australian community,'' Prime Minister John Howard said Friday.
''It's quite consistent with the letter of the understanding
concluded when Sydney won the bid a few years ago. That's the end
of the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian immigration officials cited ''serious issues of
character'' in denying entry to the two officials, one accused of
ties to organized crime in the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan
and the other with reputed links to criminal gangs in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee said denying entry to the
two men -- Gafur Rakhimov of Uzbekistan and Carl Ching of Hong Kong
-- violated agreements on the entry of accredited personnel for the
Olympics and sought an explanation from Howard.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a matter of most serious concern for the Olympic
Movement,'' IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said in a letter
to Howard.
</P>
<P>
   IOC director general Francois Carrard said Saturday (Friday
night EDT) that the IOC was still awaiting a response.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us, it's an issue of political principle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   IOC executive board member Jacques Rogge said there was
''absolutely no dispute'' with the Australian government.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they (the two officials) are not allowed, they are not
allowed,'' he said. ''We are not going to wage a war. We are not
going to insist they be let in. If this is the government's
decision, we want to know why.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard and Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said it was a
matter for Australia and not the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that the IOC has to make the sorts of inquiries
that we would ordinarily make to deal with its affairs,'' Ruddock
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carrard said the Olympic Charter states that an identity and
accreditation card serves as a visa for the games. He said the
Australian government had previously given a ''clear and
unequivocal commitment'' to honor the charter, and the provision
was also part of the host city contract signed after Sydney was
awarded the games in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''In general, you're supposed to let everyone in,'' IOC vice
president Dick Pound said. ''We had the games in the U.S. and they
had to let in the Libyan shooting team. It's part of the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rakhimov is a senior executive of the International Amateur
Boxing Association, vice president of the Uzbek Boxing Federation
and vice president of the Olympic Council of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent book that quotes FBI and Russian police files,
Rakhimov is described as an organized crime boss in Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   Ching is president of the Asian Basketball Confederation and
vice president of the international basketball federation.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong media reports said Ching, 60, had been under police
surveillance on suspicion of being linked with China's crime
syndicates known as ''triads.''
</P>
<P>
   The South China Morning Post said Ching had arrived in Sydney on
a Cathay Pacific flight Friday and was sent home on the next
flight.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Ching was barred from attending an international
basketball tournament in Canada for national security reasons, the
Morning Post said.
</P>
<P>
   A full chapter is devoted to Rakhimov in the book ''The Great
Olympic Swindle'' by British author and journalist Andrew Jennings,
a longtime IOC critic. The material was serialized in Australian
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach a representative of the Uzbek delegation at
the athletes' village in Sydney were unsuccessful. An operator said
he was instructed not to put through calls.
</P>
<P>
   The Jennings book describes Rakhimov as a wealthy businessman
and quotes from a story in Britain's Observer newspaper labeling
him as ''the Godfather of Tashkent ... a major figure in
Uzbekistan's booming heroin trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The book says the FBI office in Miami opened a file on Rakhimov
in 1995 under the heading ''Russian Organized Crime/Racketeering''
and listing him as a top figure of the new ''Eastern Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   The book also cites a dossier on Rakhimov in the Moscow office
of the Chief Directorate for Fighting Economic Crime.
</P>
<P>
   Rakhimov was also named as one of Uzbekistan's top three
organized crime bosses by the Paris-based Geopolitical Drugs Watch
in its 1997 report on world narcotics distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Rakhimov visited IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, in
1998 as part of the Uzbek Olympic delegation, according to the
book.
</P>
<P>
   Rakhimov, 49, is chairman of the board of the Uzbek-Swiss joint
trade venture Vita. He is one of the most influential entrepreneurs
in Uzbekistan and is a major sponsor of the boxing federation.
Uzbek officials said he has no criminal record, except one case in
his youth when he was charged with hooliganism.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to bar Rakhimov was the second matter in two days
involving an Olympic official from Uzbekistan. On Thursday, customs
officers at the Sydney airport found vials they suspect to be human
growth hormone -- a banned drug -- in the luggage of an Uzbek coach.

<HEADLINE> Waite Leading At Canadian Open  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKVILLE, Ontario (AP) -- The shot caused such a buzz that even
Grant Waite, the leader after two rounds of the Canadian Open, was
talking about how Tiger Woods could hit a 60-degree wedge into a
par 5 for his second shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all can't learn to hit 380 on the last hole and sand wedge
in there,'' Waite said.
</P>
<P>
   No, but the 36-year-old Waite, from New Zealand, believes he can
be like Woods in other ways. This weekend would be a good time to
start.
</P>
<P>
   With a 7-iron from the rough within 15 feet for eagle on the
last hole Friday, Waite shot past Greg Chalmers and into a 1-stroke
lead with an 8-under 64, the best score of a damp day at Glen
Abbey.
</P>
<P>
   Waite, at 11-under 133, now has his second chance in as many
weeks in Canada to post his first PGA Tour victory since the 1993
Kemper Open. He was second last week in Vancouver, a tournament he
called a ''building block.''
</P>
<P>
   At this stage in his career, it's all about eliminating the
doubts that he can win, something that Woods never worries about.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's taken away any self-doubts or lack of commitment,'' Waite
said. ''He's has an incredible faith and trust in his ability. What
we see on the golf course is a man in full flight, with nothing
stopping him.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, Waite, Chalmers and the rest of the field
have their work cut out for them when the final 36-hole stretch
begins Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The massive drive and sand wedge into 6 feet for eagle was the
final piece of an amazing blitz by Woods, who went from 1 over and
in danger of missing the cut to 5 under and only two strokes off
the lead, all in a stretch of four holes.
</P>
<P>
   Woods finished with a 7-under 65 and was just four strokes out
of the lead as he tries to finish off a fabulous summer by becoming
the only player besides Lee Trevino in 1971 to win the U.S. Open,
British Open and Canadian Open in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   In his eight victories this year, Woods has been the 36-hole
leader in seven of them. But he's not too shabby at comebacks,
either, considering he made up seven strokes in the final seven
holes to win the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, could be up for grabs until the back nine on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Chalmers, the 26-year-old lefty from Australia, birdied all the
par 5s for the second day in a row for a 65 that left him one
stroke out of the lead. Another stroke back was Brian Watts, in
contention for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   Watts is Canadian-born, even though he left Montreal before he
could even walk. Still, he would love the crowd to adopt him as one
of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Those top three can only hope they're not a warm-up act for the
headliners. Sergio Garcia, playing with the youthful energy of a
20-year-old, had a 69 and was among those at 136, just three
strokes out of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   And then came Woods, along with Davis Love III, who had a 69.
</P>
<P>
   Love has lost four head-to-head battles with Woods and will be
paired with him again on Saturday. And even though both were four
strokes back, Love figured anything better than Woods would be
somewhere around the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the No. 1 player in the world and we all want to beat
him,'' Love said.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that might slow Woods is his health -- he is
coping with the lingering effects of the flu from his hard summer
drive -- or missing his tee time.
</P>
<P>
   It could have happened Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and caddie Steve Williams thought they went off at 8:57
a.m., not 7:57 a.m. So, while Woods was lounging in the clubhouse
waiting for the chef to make an omelet, his playing partners were
grinding away on the practice range.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got here early to eat some breakfast, and the lady came up
to me and says, 'Well, you have 15 minutes until your tee time,'''
Woods said. ''So I ran down there and got on the range. Actually,
it was probably a blessing in disguise because I'm not really
feeling my best physically. It was nice to not wear myself out on
the range.''
</P>
<P>
   While Woods said the hurried start to his day wasn't a factor,
it sure looked like it. He had to save par with a delicate bunker
shot to a green sloping away from him, then took bogey on the par-3
12th when he badly missed a 4-foot putt.
</P>
<P>
   He had to work for every par and appeared to be going through
the motions at 1 over through five holes, in danger of missing the
cut for the first and only time since the 1997 Canadian Open at
Royal Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, he was back in the hunt. It began with a pure
swing on the par-3 15th, an 8-iron into 4 feet that Woods called
his best swing of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just tried to keep the same feeling I had on that one shot
for the rest of the day,'' Woods said. ''I hit some beautiful
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   He reached the par-5 16th with a 9-iron into 3 feet, hit a
6-iron from the bunker on No. 17 into 4 feet and then turned the
18th into a short par 4.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Woods is tied for seventh, he is clearly on
everyone's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''The less I think about it, the better off I'll be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to notice Woods these days.

<HEADLINE> Runner Withdraws From Olympics  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) -- A recurring respiratory problem has
knocked America's top medal contender out of the women's 1,500
meters at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Jacobs said Friday she had problems breathing since
racing in a meet in Zurich, Switzerland, Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a result, I was feeling very fatigued and sluggish,''
Jacobs, 37, said in a statement released by Nike.
</P>
<P>
   While her condition appeared to be improving until Tuesday, ''I
had a relapse and couldn't even complete my workout.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had hoped to get it under control before Sydney, but we
seemed to have run out of time. Further, Tom (husband/coach Tom
Craig) and I felt that competing at Sydney could put me at risk of
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, I'm very disappointed and wish I could be competing
in Sydney. These things happen and now I just have to focus on the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said she would be in Sydney to support the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Her agent, Emmanuel Hudson, also expressed disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very sorry to get the call from Regina yesterday,'' he
said. ''She was a favorite for a medal and it's a very unfortunate
situation for her. It's a big loss for U.S. track and field and the
Olympic team.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. women's coach Karen Dennis said a replacement had not been
picked, but the top candidate would be Shayne Culpepper, the
fourth-place finisher at the U.S. Olympic trials in July at
Sacramento, Calif. Culpepper's husband, Alan, is a member of the
10,000-meter team.
</P>
<P>
   The other members of the 1,500 team are Suzy Favor Hamilton and
Marla Runyan.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs won the 1,500 at the trials and set the U.S. record in
the 5,000 meters. She withdrew from the Olympic 5,000 to
concentrate on the 1,500, in which she won the world indoor title
in 1995 and was the world outdoor silver medalist in 1997 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This would have been Jacobs' fourth Olympics. In 1988 and 1992,
she failed to make the 1,500 final and in 1996 she finished 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs has won the U.S. 1,500 outdoor title eight times,
including last year when she also doubled in the 1,500 and 5,000,
and was a bronze medallist in the 3,000 at the 1999 world indoor
championships.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Rails Against Critics  </HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe on
Friday railed against critics of his land reform plan and said he
will not back down from a campaign to take away farms from
descendants of white British colonialists and give them to
impoverished blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our conscience is clear. We will not go back. We shall
continue to effect economic and social justice for all our people
without fear or favor,'' he said in a speech to the U.N. Millennium
Summit of world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has come under fire for his land reform plan and for
supporting violent mobs that have occupied more than 1,600
white-owned farms since February. The unrest has been led by
veterans of the war that ended white rule in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe used the international forum to defend his policies and
blast critics.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 whites own one-third of the fertile farmland, where
2 million farm workers and their family members live. About 7.5
million people live on the other two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have sought to redress this inequity through a fast track
land reform and resettlement program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My country, my government, my party and my person are labeled
'land grabbers', demonized, reviled and threatened with sanctions
in the face of accusations of reverse-racism,'' he told the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate is considering a bill to force Zimbabwe to pay
off its debt to the United States and suspend U.S. aid unless law
and order is restored and property that was held before January is
returned.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, addressing a mostly black audience of nearly 1,000
at Harlem's Mount Olivet Baptist Church, Mugabe said that because
blacks received no payment for their land, neither will whites.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will die clinging to our land,'' he said. ''We shall take
the land and pay no compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   While in New York for the summit, Mugabe was served with a civil
lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court alleging that he orchestrated
a campaign of violence to keep his political party in office, The
Washington Post reported in its Saturday edition.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, who filed the case under a 211-year-old U.S. law
that allows foreigners to sue for violations of international law,
include relatives of three people slain and a political opponent
who claims she was attacked. The lawsuit seeks about $400 million
in damages, the Post reported.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Rebels Release Four Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels freed four Europeans on
Saturday after holding them for more than four months in a southern
Philippine jungle, negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels turned over the four hostages to
go-betweens who visited their camp on southern Jolo island, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado said the four
Europeans would be lifted out by helicopter and taken to nearby
Zamboanga city, where they will be presented to their ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels had been holding six Europeans in their jungle camp.
Two French television journalists were not released Saturday,
Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
   The release was threatened earlier Saturday by an ambush of the
two go-betweens as they traveled to the rebels' camp to arrange the
release.
</P>
<P>
   One of their bodyguards was killed and five others were wounded,
government negotiators said. Many civilians also were injured, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   The go-betweens, who were not injured, were being escorted by
Ghalib ''Robot'' Andang, the leader of the rebel faction holding
the hostages, when they were attacked by another guerrilla faction,
Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
   Gunfire continued for several hours after the attack began.
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado would not comment on the motive, but the go-betweens
were believed to be carrying a large ransom for the European
hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have reported growing tensions within the Abu Sayyaf
over the sharing of millions of dollars in ransom they have
reportedly received for previous hostage releases.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred about three miles from where the hostages
were being held, military reports said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of a passenger jeep, Abdul Majin Kasim, said he saw a
convoy of about five vans fired upon by men along a main road.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were so many shots. I dove out of my jeep,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, unconfirmed military reports had said the ambush was
directed at Andang and another leader of his faction.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages released Saturday were two Finns, a French citizen
and a German, all kidnapped April 23 from Malaysia's Sipadan diving
resort.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Andang had backed out of a promise to free all the
Europeans, instead offering only three. Government negotiators
refused, canceling the release.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf say they are seeking an independent Islamic state
in the mostly Roman Catholic Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado said Andang had been worried about a military assault
if all the foreign hostages are freed. The government negotiator
said he told Andang an attack was unlikely as long as the rebels
were holding another group of 12 Filipino Christian evangelists.
</P>
<P>
   The evangelists and the two French journalists were both seized
in early July when they visited the rebels' camp.
</P>
<P>
   A separate Abu Sayyaf faction is holding an American, Jeffrey
Schilling, who was kidnapped in late August.
</P>
<P>
   Libyan officials, who are helping negotiate for the European
hostages, prepared only $4 million in ransom, enough to pay for
just four hostages, an official close to the negotiating panel
said. Libya has resisted paying for the two journalists, saying
their company should be responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Libya reportedly paid $6 million for the release of
six other Westerners from the Sipadan group. It insists the money
will go for development projects, not directly to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, 24, a Muslim convert from Oakland, Calif., was seized
Aug. 28 when he visited a rebel camp with his Filipino Muslim wife,
Ivi Osani. Osani, who is the second cousin of rebel spokesman Abu
Sabaya, was not abducted.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have not announced their demands for Schilling's
release, although Sabaya has privately demanded $10 million,
negotiators said.

<HEADLINE> Village Divided Over School Sidewalk  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO, N.Y. (AP) -- Michael Havens thought he had a great idea
for his students to raise money: Sell bricks to members of the
community and allow personal messages to be etched on them, then
use the bricks to repave the sidewalk in front of the high school.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was beautiful,'' said Havens, who saw the same thing during
a trip to Idaho a couple of years ago. ''We have a beautiful
Georgian building, and changing the blacktopped front entranceway
to nicely, personally engraved bricks seemed like a nice idea.''
</P>
<P>
   But when a few brick buyers wanted their religious sentiments
inscribed, tempers flared in this village of 1,500 about 30 miles
north of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Now the school district is being sued in a battle of
constitutional issues -- freedom of speech vs. the separation of
church and state -- and Havens, the former superintendent, is long
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Three residents -- two of them reverends -- filed suit Thursday in
U.S. District Court in Albany, charging the district with violating
their free speech and equal protection rights. The case is expected
to go to trial in the spring, said Steven H. Aden of the Rutherford
Institute, the Virginia-based legal aid society for conservative
religious causes that is representing the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the litigants, the Rev. Ronald Russell, pastor of the
Church of God, helped ignite the dispute when he bought a handful
of bricks for his son Joshua's graduating class of 1999. Russell
had two Christian messages etched on them: ''Jesus Saves'' and
''Jesus Christ is the Lord of this School.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was a great idea, tremendous,'' said Russell.
''They were a great fund-raiser and really enhanced the school's
look.''
</P>
<P>
   But Betsy Passer, who is Jewish, didn't like what she saw on the
sidewalk in front of Mexico Academy and Central School and
challenged district officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't against the bricks,'' said Passer, whose husband
teaches math at the school. ''I was for some guidelines. They were
allowing people to put whatever they wanted on them. So we went
over, walked the walk, wrote down the ones we had objections to and
tried to talk with them about it. We tried to discuss this with
them for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, district officials moved the bricks in question under
a bush. Then, after some legal advice, they placed a metal plaque
on the brick path: ''The messages on this walk are the personal
expressions and contributions of the individuals of Mexico Academy
and Central School Community.''
</P>
<P>
   Passer was not placated, so she bought her own brick in February
and had ''Keep Abortion Legal'' inscribed on it. ''I feel very
strongly about a woman's right to control her body,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   School officials blocked her purchase, then removed the bricks
inscribed with Jesus and revised the rules to prohibit such
references.
</P>
<P>
   Havens, who had been a fixture in the 2,800-student district for
24 years before leaving for another district in April, said the
district lawyer advised that the bricks inappropriately promoted
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to, but I had to put them in a position where
they could see that a plaque from them saying these are
contributions to the Mexico Academy and Central School community
was not enough,'' said Passer, who is Jewish. ''We are not of that
belief system. This is a public school. If you want private values,
you go to private schools.''
</P>
<P>
   That prompted an outcry in a community which has eight churches,
four of them within 100 feet of one another, on Church Street.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Russell erected a big wooden cross on a hill next to
his church with this message tacked across the front: ''Welcome to
Mexico! A Town Where Jesus Christ Is Not Welcomed in the Schools.''
He removed the sign after about 10 days
</P>
<P>
   ''We made a statement with it,'' Russell said. ''There's no
doubt everybody takes sides on an issue like this, and that's a
shame because it wasn't meant to be provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   Hadwen Hinman, a former mayor and graduate of the school system,
expressed his own views with a sign in his front yard: ''Jesus
Christ is Still Lord of This School.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a disciple of Jesus Christ, first of all,'' said Hinman,
72. ''Secondly, the Constitution was written by the principles of
the Bible, and to deny people the right to put a brick in that says
'Jesus Saves' or 'Jesus is Christ' is against my right in the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Five churches launched a campaign, distributing pins, signs and
bumper stickers printed with the message ''Jesus is Lord.'' Several
businesses along Main Street joined them, posting ''Jesus Is Lord''
signs in their windows.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bricks were like a final straw of a continuation of the
policy of zero access and freedom of gathering, freedom of
speech,'' said 43-year-old Paul Anderson, one of the litigants and
assistant pastor at Believers Chapel. ''It was the catalyst for a
bunch of pastors to get together.''
</P>
<P>
   Duane Comes, who graduated from the high school in June, said a
lot of people were tired of the whole ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people are getting annoyed with it now,'' Comes said.
''They think that it should be over. But I keep telling everybody,
'What if it was you, what if it was your brick, your opinion or
your belief?' You're not going to want it taken it away.'''
</P>
<P>
   But interim superintendent Robert DiFlorio said the looming
legal battle is something taxpayers cannot afford to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''This district is poor,'' DiFlorio said. ''If this is a form of
punishment, it's not a very Christian attitude.''

<HEADLINE> Jesse Jackson urges Peru president to free U.S. woman  </HEADLINE>
By CARMEN VALDIVIESO HULBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The Rev. Jesse Jackson appeared unexpectedly at
a luncheon for Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori on Friday,
urging the leader to release an American woman who has spent nearly
five years in jail in Peru for treason.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the release of New York-native Lori Berenson would
help improve U.S. relations with Peru, which has been criticized
for a ragged human rights record and alleged irregularities in
Fujimori's recent election to a third straight term in office.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met, meanwhile, with
Fujimori and urged him to implement a plan for democratic reform
proposed by the Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   He responded that he intended to carry out the reforms, which
include restoring the country's disbanded constitutional court, a
senior U.S. official said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Albright told reporters she raised the Berenson case with the
Peruvian president and that she was hopeful it would be resolved
fairly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that somewhere the system can find the capacity to
forgive her and free her,'' said Jackson, who made his comments as
the Peruvian leader was taking questions from people at the
luncheon. ''Such a humane gesture would be of benefit to everyone
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fujimori, who was one of about 150 leaders attending the
U.N. Millennium Summit in New York, responded it was Peru's
judiciary's job to decide her fate not his.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a delicate issue for Peruvians,'' Fujimori later told
reporters, referring to Peru's war against the Tupac Amaru and
Shining Path guerrillas, which left 25,000 dead and devastated the
economy since it began in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a veteran civil rights activist, said he planned to
visit Peru to make a ''mercy plea'' for her release, but that the
date of the trip had not been set.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who showed up uninvited to the event, added that he
thought she did not receive a fair trial when a secret military
court sentenced her to life in prison in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson, 30, was convicted by a military tribunal for helping
leftist Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement rebels plan an attack on
Peru's Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's highest military court announced last week that it had
overturned that conviction, paving the way for a new trial in a
civilian court, a longtime demand of U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   But state prosecutors have predicted Berenson will likely
receive a minimum 20-year sentence in the civilian trial.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori largely stamped out the groups in the early 1990s using
tough tactics and summary military courts to imprison suspected
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not making any accusation against Lori Berenson, but she
was detained with a group that was going to assault congress,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asking for understanding from Americans he said: ''The United
States has known terrorism with the attacks on the World Trade
Center and in Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, Fujimori proposed to world leaders at the summit
that the bank accounts and other properties of drug traffickers be
seized and the money used to help ease extreme poverty in
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that mechanisms be created to ''permit these evilly
obtained resources to be confiscated for the benefit of poor
countries,'' which he said are harmed most by drug production and
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the world's cocaine is produced in Peru, which also
suffers from widespread poverty.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Urged To Disarm Militias  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With pro-Indonesia groups who terrorized
East Timor last year again wreaking havoc, U.S. Ambassador Richard
Holbrooke said it was time to review whether an international war
crimes tribunal is needed to prosecute militia leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's comments, echoed by East Timor's independence
leaders, came before the Security Council unanimously adopted a
resolution Friday insisting Indonesia immediately disarm and
disband the militias that slaughtered three U.N. aid workers in
West Timor and reportedly killed another 20 civilians Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He also announced the council was sending a mission to Indonesia
and East Timor to investigate the resurgence of militia activity
against U.N. workers and civilians on both sides of Timor. The date
for the mission's departure hasn't been set.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have ample evidence that the threat is increasing,''
Holbrooke said. ''We must face facts. The Indonesian military, or
to be more precise, elements within the Indonesian military, are
directly or indirectly responsible for these outrages.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. workers fled West Timor after a militia-led mob stormed an
office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in the town of
Atambua on Wednesday, killing three U.N. workers and three
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The militias are the same groups that, with backing from
elements in the Indonesian military, wreaked destruction in East
Timor after residents there voted for independence in an August
1999 referendum. The anti-independence militiamen were pushed into
the western part of Timor island when U.N. peacekeepers took
control in the east.
</P>
<P>
   UNHCR has been caring for the tens of thousands of East Timorese
who fled to West Timor during the violence that followed the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In its resolution, the council condemned the deaths of the three
UNHCR workers as ''outrageous and contemptible'' and insisted
Indonesia immediately disarm militias, bring those responsible to
justice, restore law and order and prevent militia members from
crossing into East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   East Timorese independence leaders Jose ''Xanana'' Gusmao and
Jose Ramos-Horta, who attended the Security Council vote, welcomed
the resolution, which also hinted at the possibility of U.N.
participation in the prosecution of militia members.
</P>
<P>
   The council in February accepted Indonesia's pledge to conduct
its own inquiry into the crimes surrounding the independence vote
and prosecute those responsible, despite a recommendation from a
U.N. commission that it create a war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   But when Indonesian prosecutors last week announced their
suspects, the list did not include the former military chief
accused of bearing ultimate responsibility for the violence, or a
prominent milita leader.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said in light of the attacks and the prosecutors'
exclusion of key suspects, the February decision not to establish
an international tribunal or a joint U.N.-Indonesian tribunal
''must also now be reviewed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said recent moves by the United States to restore
military-to-military relations with Indonesia -- severed after last
year's violence in East Timor -- also need to be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   This week's attacks led to heated criticism at the United
Nations of Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid, in town for the
U.N. Millennium Summit, which opened and closed its historic
session with a minute of silence for the slain aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid tried to assure world leaders that Indonesia was in
control of the situation, announcing that two battalions had been
deployed to West Timor and that suspects were already in custody.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything is under control,'' Wahid said Friday. ''The
situation now is going very well.''
</P>
<P>
   But the council said Indonesia had to do more to disarm the
militias that have been terrorizing East Timorese in the West Timor
refugee camps and are blamed for the deaths of two U.N.
peacekeepers in East Timor this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos-Horta, who shared the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize with Roman
Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, said the East Timorese still had
respect and faith in Indonesia's intention to go after the militia
leaders. But he said council consideration of a possible war crimes
tribunal would ''strengthen the hand'' of prosecutors, even if one
weren't created.

<HEADLINE> Police say 11-year-old is serial burglar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - An alleged 11-year-old burglar admitted to five
Brooklyn break-ins over the past five weeks, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-foot-9 boy allegedly netted a collection of green cards,
ATM cards, jewelry and petty cash from the crime spree in the
Flatbush section, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, who was not identified because of his age, was arrested
late Thursday when police spotted him climbing a fire escape,
apparently looking for an open window.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the tiny thief broke in to an apartment on Aug. 26,
and the following night stole some jewelry from a second home. On
Aug. 29, he allegedly grabbed a purse from another apartment, and
stole jewelry from a fourth apartment two days later.
</P>
<P>
   The last burglary happened on Sept. 1, when he stole documents
from a fifth apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The case was referred to Family Court and the boy was released
into his parents' custody.

<HEADLINE> 100 Injured After China Explosion  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HUTZLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A truck taking explosives to be disposed of blew
up in China's restive Muslim northwest, killing 60 people, injuring
309 others and scorching houses and vehicles, officials and state
media said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Xinhua News Agency reported the casualty count in the
explosion Friday evening in Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang
region, and officials with the city police and government confirmed
the account. But they provided few details.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the explosion was an accident, although
they have not ruled out terrorism, said a Xinjiang official, who
only gave his surname, Zhang.
</P>
<P>
   Police and paramilitary units cleared the wreckage through the
night, sending the injured to at least four area hospitals,
government and medical officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some among the 90 injured taken to the Coal Mining Hospital were
permanently blinded or crippled by the explosion, said an emergency
room administrator, surnamed Chen.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion occurred around 5:30 p.m. on a major artery in the
sprawling industrial city's western suburbs that was crowded with
residents leaving work. Xinhua added that more than 20 vehicles and
homes were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a boom and saw black smoke in the sky,'' said an
employee at the Materials Transport Co., also surnamed Chen. He ran
more than a mile from his office to the explosion site.
</P>
<P>
   He said he counted at least 50 people dead and saw the injured,
too numerous to count, lying on the road and sidewalk. He said the
truck that apparently carried the explosives was a military
vehicle, although government officials refused to confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   Although police cordoned off the area for rescue work, the road
was opened to vehicles and pedestrians by daybreak Saturday,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Explosives are widely available for construction in rapidly
developing China and accidents are common. But Xinjiang also is the
scene of the most violent internal threat faced by China's
communist government.
</P>
<P>
   Uighurs, Turkic Muslims who are the region's largest ethnic
group, have long resisted Chinese rule. Since the mid-1990s,
militant separatists have waged a campaign of bombings and
assassinations against Chinese and suspected collaborators. China
launched a crackdown in 1996 that has failed to quell the unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Urumqi, a largely Chinese city, has seen few separatist attacks.
But in one of the most coordinated acts of violent protest,
militants set off bombs nearly simultaneously on three buses in
Urumqi in February 1997, killing nine and injuring 68. A month
later they blew up a bus in Beijing, injuring ten.

<HEADLINE> Castro tells U.S. supporters he was pleased by Clinton handshake  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A church full of admiring American supporters in
Harlem erupted in applause early Saturday when Cuban leader Fidel
Castro told them how pleased he was to shake hands earlier in the
week with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel satisfied by my respectful and civilized behavior with
the president of the country that had been host of the summit,''
Castro told the invitation-only crowd at towering Riverside Church.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Castro had publicly mentioned the
much-discussed encounter between the two leaders at the end of a
luncheon of the U.N. Millennium Summit, a gathering of about 160
world leaders. The news was especially encouraging to Americans who
support the normalization of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his olive green uniform after spending a week in the
black suits he favors for presidential gatherings, Castro told the
crowd at the end of a far-ranging address about how he encountered
Clinton face-to-face for the first time on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he found himself in a line of leaders being greeted by
the American president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't run away to prevent passing by that point,'' Castro
said, growing animated at his speech, which early on was punctuated
by the crowd's shouts of ''Fidel! Fidel! Fidel!''
</P>
<P>
   ''With all dignity and courtesy I greeted him,'' the Cuban
president said. ''He did the same, and I moved ahead in line. It
would have been extravagant and rude to do any other thing. The
whole thing lasted less than 20 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 people attended the 8 p.m. event organized by
Cuban solidarity groups, with many of the invited guests lining up
outside the church as early as 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Castro was clearly moved by the affection shown him by the
Americans who surrounded him, especially when they sang ''Happy
Birthday'' in belated recognition of his turning 74 in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dear brothers and sisters,'' he told them, hugging several
children who gave him a plastic-wrapped bouquet of flowers. ''You
have been extremely generous and kind with us.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is only because of miracles that I have survived all these
years,'' alluding to the many assassination attempts against the
communist leader during his 41 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came to Harlem because I knew it was here that I would find
my best friends,'' he added. Among those in the church were U.S.
Rep. Maxine Waters of Los Angeles and U.S. Rep. Jose Serrano of New
York, and the Rev. Dr. Lucius Walker Jr. of Pastors for Peace, all
longtime opponents of the 38-year-old U.S. embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Other guests included the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, the former
head of the National Council of Churches, who campaigned vigorously
for the repatriation of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father in
Cuba, even bringing the boy's grandmothers to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Riverside Church is an institution in Harlem, where it
played a major organizing role in the civil rights movement of the
1960s. It was from this pulpit that the late Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. first spoke out against the Vietnam War and is where South
African leader Nelson Mandela first appeared in America after his
release from prison a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the church wore pins or stickers that said ''Free
Mumia,'' a reference to death row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal who was
convicted in the killing of a Philadelphia police officer. His
supporters maintain he did not receive a fair trial and have
launched an international campaign for a new one.
</P>
<P>
   A sign carried by one supporter read: ''Hail Castro, Jail
Giuliani,'' a reference to New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who
snubbed Castro during the summit and in the days before described
the Cuban leader as a ''murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro has great fondness for Harlem and black Americans in
general, having first visited the neighborhood during a 1960 trip
to the United Nations for that year's General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Refused from a midtown hotel, the delegation of bearded
guerrillas who had recently assumed power on the island moved to
Harlem's Hotel Theresa. Thousands of Harlem residents crowded the
streets to cheer them.
</P>
<P>
   There, Castro met with black leader Malcolm X, and met
separately with then-Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Gamal Abdel
Nassar of the United Arab Republic also paid his respects to Castro
at the hotel, which has since been torn down.
</P>
<P>
   Castro returned to Harlem during his last visit to New York in
1995, when he addressed the General Assembly. On that trip, he met
with more than 2,000 American supporters at the Abyssinian Baptist
Church and also visited the Bronx.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Junta Accuses Opposition  </HEADLINE>
By AYE AYE WIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- A senior member of Myanmar's military
government accused the pro-democracy opposition of conspiring with
Western countries to undermine the education system.
</P>
<P>
   ''A group of destructive elements ... is conspiring with
nationals from Western nations to create disturbance and jeopardize
the present peaceful pursuit of education,'' Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt
said in remarks published in all three government-owned daily
newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Myanmar's state-run press on Friday had accused opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi of being power-hungry and blamed her for
pushing the country toward ''utter devastation.'' For the past few
weeks, it has kept up a drumbeat of criticism of Suu Kyi's movement
and its foreign supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The military government launched a new crackdown on Suu Kyi's
National League for Democracy on Sept. 2, following a nine-day
confrontation in which authorities blocked her from traveling to
the countryside to engage in political activities.
</P>
<P>
   The NLD headquarters have been closed and senior party officials
confined to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her
nonviolent pro-democracy work, has long been a target of the
state-controlled press. News media echo the military government's
claim that she and her party are impeding progress toward democracy
and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Khin Nyunt, Secretary-One of the ruling State Peace and
Development Council, made his accusations at an International
Literacy Day ceremony Friday in Yangon.
</P>
<P>
   Khin Nyunt claimed NLD leaders and youth members, along with 15
foreigners, held a discussion on education at the party's
headquarters last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''This trumped-up discussion was videotaped and distributed to
other countries to dampen the enthusiasm and spirit of the students
and jeopardize the continuing education,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Myanmar's universities and colleges, hotbeds of activism since
the days of British colonial rule, were reopened in July after
being closed in 1996 following student demonstrations in Yangon.
</P>
<P>
   They had been open only 30 months since 1988, when the
government crushed an uprising against a quarter-century of
military rule.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-democracy leaders and foreign human rights organizations
have cited the closing of schools as one of many human rights
abuses inflicted by the military on the population in Myanmar,
which is also known as Burma.
</P>
<P>
   A commentary in the Kyemon newspaper Saturday accused Western
nations of meddling in the internal affairs of the country by
criticizing the restrictions imposed on NLD leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a matter between the ruling government and a political
party. it is our internal affair and not the concern of others and
they are meddling in our internal affairs,'' the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Myanmar's government has kept the NLD on a tight leash since
1988, when Suu Kyi helped lead pro-democracy demonstrations. The
military allowed national elections in 1990 but refused to honor
the results when the NLD achieved a landslide victory.

<HEADLINE> Russia Military Attache Leaves Japan  </HEADLINE>
By GARY SCHAEFER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A Russian Embassy official suspected of spying on
Japan left the country Saturday, a day after the arrest of a
Japanese naval officer who allegedly gave him classified documents.
</P>
<P>
   Television news showed Victor Bogatenkov, a 44-year-old military
attache, pushing his way through a crowd of reporters at Tokyo's
main international airport to board an Aeroflot flight to Moscow.
He was accompanied by several bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe Bogatenkov bought military secrets from a
Japanese naval officer working as a researcher in the country's
National Institute for Defense Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The naval officer, 38-year-old Lt. Cmdr. Shigehiro Hagisaki, was
taken into custody Thursday night when police found him at a Tokyo
restaurant with Bogatenkov.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian attache refused to be questioned by police, citing
his diplomatic immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, which is
investigating the case, and Japan's Defense Agency both declined to
say whether Bogatenkov had been asked to leave by the Japanese
government. Telephone calls to Japan's Foreign Ministry went
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Losyukov told the
Interfax news agency that Bogatenkov had been scheduled to return
home because his term in Japan was ending.
</P>
<P>
   Losyukov said it was not clear if Russia would respond by
expelling a Japanese diplomat, adding that the Russian government
would act ''very carefully -- consider all the circumstances and
adopt a balanced decision, taking into account the context of
Russian-Japanese relations, among other things.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Japanese media reports, police suspect Bogatenkov
was a Russian intelligence officer who wined and dined the Japanese
naval officer in an attempt to gain information about the
activities of U.S. naval units stationed in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Kerik reportedly preparing to move 300 officers to patrol duty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Police commissioner Bernard Kerik is planning to
move at least 300 officers from quality-of-life enforcement to
street patrols as part of a larger reassignment that will also beef
up the city's detective squads, The New York Times reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik laid out his plans for the redeployment of about 500
officers during a meeting of senior patrol commanders on Thursday,
according to unnamed police officials cited by The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik told the city's eight patrol borough commanders that he
wanted more officers and detectives in the streets, and that he
wanted to let rank-and-file officers know that hard work would lead
to promotion, the officials told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik said he would move 300 to 450 officers out of so-called
tracer units, which focus on quality-of-life violations like public
drinking, urination and vandalism, the officials said. The purpose
of these units, which include 900 officers, is to stabilize
troubled neighborhoods and maintain the gains won through narcotics
crackdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The unit officers selected to return to patrol will be selected
from those who have made the least arrests and shown the least
initiative, The Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik also asked the commanders to select the highest achiever
in each of the 76 precincts and in Housing and Transit Bureau
commands to work in detective squads, which have long been
understaffed. Once in the squads, the officers would be on the
traditional 18-month track to promotion to a detective's position,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, 70 detectives from narcotics and 10 from the
218-member Street Crime Unit are to be assigned to precinct
detective commands, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Scotto, the president of the detectives union, the
Detectives Endowment Association, praised the moves. Scotto told
the newspaper that, citywide, squads have been short 400 detectives
for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 7,300 detectives in the department, only about 1,100 are
assigned to the precinct units, which investigate serious crimes,
including murder and robbery, The Times said.

<HEADLINE> 160 Killed in China Explosion  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HUTZLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A truck carrying explosives blew up in China's
restive Muslim northwest, killing 60 people, injuring 173 others
and scorching nearby vehicles and homes, officials and state media
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Xinhua News Agency reported the casualty count in the
explosion Friday evening in Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang region,
and officials with the city police and government confirmed the
account. But they provided few details.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the explosion was an accident, although
they have not ruled out terrorism, said an official with Xinjiang's
foreign propaganda office, who gave only his surname, Zhang.
</P>
<P>
   Police and paramilitary units cleared the wreckage through the
night, sending the injured to at least four area hospitals,
government and medical officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some among the 90 injured taken to the Coal Mining Hospital were
permanently blinded or crippled by the explosion, said an emergency
room administrator, surnamed Chen.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion occurred around 5:30 p.m. on a major artery in the
sprawling industrial city's western suburbs that was crowded with
residents leaving work. Xinhua said the truck was taking the
explosives for disposal when they detonated. It added that more
than 20 vehicles and homes were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a boom and saw black smoke in the sky,'' said an
employee at the Materials Transport Co., also surnamed Chen. He ran
a mile from his office to the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   He counted at least 50 people dead and saw the injured, too
numerous to count, lying on the road and sidewalk. He said the
truck that apparently carried the explosives was a military
vehicle, although government officials refused to confirm the
description.
</P>
<P>
   Although police cordoned off the area for rescue work, the road
was opened to vehicles and pedestrians by midmorning Saturday,
Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 hours after the blast, Xinhua reported that 309 people
were injured but later, citing local officials, revised the figure
to 173. It gave no further reason for the discrepancy and did not
say how many were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Explosives are widely available for construction in rapidly
developing China and accidents are common. But Xinjiang is also the
scene of the most violent internal threat faced by China's
communist government.
</P>
<P>
   Uighurs, Turkic Muslims who are the region's largest ethnic
group, have long resisted Chinese rule. Since the mid-1990s,
militant separatists have waged a campaign of bombings and
assassinations against Chinese and suspected collaborators. China
launched a crackdown in 1996 that has failed to quell the unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Urumqi, a largely Chinese city, has seen few separatist attacks.
But in one of the most coordinated acts of violent protest,
militants set off bombs nearly simultaneously on three buses in
Urumqi in February 1997, killing nine and injuring 68. A month
later they blew up a bus in Beijing, injuring ten.

<HEADLINE> Vatican Aide's Book Makes Claims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A top aide to Pope John Paul II claims primacy for
the Roman Catholic faith in an upcoming book that says the church
hopes that Jews will embrace Christianity, a German magazine
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The book by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the powerful Vatican
official who oversees Roman Catholic doctrine, says ''Catholics
don't want to impose Christ on the Jews, but they are waiting for
the moment when Israel too says yes to Christ,'' according to the
Focus weekly.
</P>
<P>
   On relations with Protestant churches, Ratzinger said the goal
was to unite Christianity in a single faith with Catholics taking
the lead. ''We as Catholics are convinced that such a single church
exists in its basic form in the Catholic church,'' Focus quoted
from the book, due to be published next month.
</P>
<P>
   The reported excerpts were in line with a declaration this month
by the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, headed
by Ratzinger, that questioned what it said were attempts to portray
all religions as equal.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II has made reaching out to non-Catholics a focus
of his 22-year papacy. But Ratzinger, a German, appears to be
setting limits on such attempts to improve interfaith relations.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Security Foils Attack  </HEADLINE>
By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukraine's security service thwarted a plan
to kill one of the former Soviet republics' presidents during last
month's summit, the head of the service said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Leonid Derkach, head of the security service, said four people
from the breakaway Russian republic of Chechnya and several from
Middle East countries, were detained in connection with the plan,
according to the news agency Interfax.
</P>
<P>
   Derkach did not name the intended target of the attack, but the
reported Chechen involvement raised speculation that it was Russian
President Vladimir Putin, who was among eight presidents from the
Commonwealth of Independent States to attend the summit in the
Crimean city of Yalta.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is waging a war in Chechnya against separatist rebels,
whom it claims are backed by Muslim extremists from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's press service and the Russian Federal Security Service
declined to comment on the report Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Putin, the presidents of Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Kazakstan, Tajikistan and Ukraine also
participated in the Aug. 18-19 summit.
</P>
<P>
   Derkach spoke after a closed-door meeting of security services'
chiefs from the former Soviet republics in Kiev, the Ukrainian
capital. Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma met Saturday with the
officials, whose discussions focused on ways to combat
international terrorism and crime, Kuchma's press service said.
</P>
<P>
   The head of Russia's Federal Security Service, Nikolai
Patrushev, said a long-planned anti-terrorist center that would be
jointly operated by the former Soviet republics was close to
realization.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the countries are facing international terrorism. For
Russia, it is Chechnya and Central Asia,'' Patrushev said. ''Our
task is to prevent terrorism from unfolding in Central Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia is wary of the spread of radical Islam in Central Asia,
where Muslim insurgents believed backed by Afghanistan's Taliban
regime are skirmishing with government troops in Uzbekistan,
Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.

<HEADLINE> Castro Pleased by Handshake  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A church full of admiring American supporters in
Harlem erupted in applause early Saturday when Cuban leader Fidel
Castro told them how pleased he was to shake hands earlier in the
week with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel satisfied by my respectful and civilized behavior with
the president of the country that had been host of the summit,''
Castro told the invitation-only crowd at towering Riverside Church.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Castro had publicly mentioned the
much-discussed encounter between the two leaders at the end of a
luncheon of the U.N. Millennium Summit, a gathering of about 160
world leaders. The news was especially encouraging to Americans who
support the normalization of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his olive green uniform after spending a week in the
black suits he favors for presidential gatherings, Castro told the
crowd at the end of a far-ranging address about how he encountered
Clinton face-to-face for the first time on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he found himself in a line of leaders being greeted by
the American president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't run away to prevent passing by that point,'' Castro
said, growing animated at his speech, which early on was punctuated
by the crowd's shouts of ''Fidel! Fidel! Fidel!''
</P>
<P>
   ''With all dignity and courtesy I greeted him,'' the Cuban
president said. ''He did the same, and I moved ahead in line. It
would have been extravagant and rude to do any other thing. The
whole thing lasted less than 20 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 people attended the 8 p.m. event organized by
Cuban solidarity groups, with many of the invited guests lining up
outside the church as early as 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban leader evidently went straight to the airport shortly
after the gathering wound up.
</P>
<P>
   Castro's plane landed at 8:47 a.m. EDT in Havana, where he was
greeted at the airport by other top officials, including Vice
President Carlos Lage, Cuba's Radio Reloj reported.
</P>
<P>
   Castro was clearly moved by the affection shown him by the
Americans who surrounded him, especially when they sang ''Happy
Birthday'' in belated recognition of his turning 74 in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dear brothers and sisters,'' he told them, hugging several
children who gave him a plastic-wrapped bouquet of flowers. ''You
have been extremely generous and kind with us.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is only because of miracles that I have survived all these
years,'' alluding to the many assassination attempts against the
communist leader during his 41 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came to Harlem because I knew it was here that I would find
my best friends,'' he added. Among those in the church were U.S.
Rep. Maxine Waters of Los Angeles and U.S. Rep. Jose Serrano of New
York, and the Rev. Dr. Lucius Walker Jr. of Pastors for Peace, all
longtime opponents of the 38-year-old U.S. embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Other guests included the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, the former
head of the National Council of Churches, who campaigned vigorously
for the repatriation of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father in
Cuba, even bringing the boy's grandmothers to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Riverside Church is an institution in Harlem, where it
played a major organizing role in the civil rights movement of the
1960s. It was from this pulpit that the late Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. spoke out against the Vietnam War and was one of South
African leader Nelson Mandela first stops in America after his
release from prison a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the church wore pins or stickers that said ''Free
Mumia,'' a reference to death row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal who was
convicted in the killing of a Philadelphia police officer. His
supporters maintain he did not receive a fair trial and have
launched an international campaign for a new one.
</P>
<P>
   A sign carried by one supporter read: ''Hail Castro, Jail
Giuliani,'' a reference to New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who
snubbed Castro during the summit and in the days before described
the Cuban leader as a ''murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro has great fondness for Harlem and black Americans in
general, having first visited the neighborhood during a 1960 trip
to the United Nations for that year's General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Refused at the Shelburne Hotel in midtown, the delegation of
bearded guerrillas who had recently assumed power on the island
moved to Harlem's Hotel Theresa. Thousands of Harlem residents
crowded the streets to cheer them.
</P>
<P>
   There, Castro met with black leader Malcolm X, and met
separately with then-Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Gamal Abdel
Nassar of the United Arab Republic also paid his respects to Castro
at the hotel, which has since been torn down.
</P>
<P>
   Castro returned to Harlem during his last visit to New York in
1995, when he addressed the General Assembly. On that trip, he met
with more than 2,000 American supporters at the Abyssinian Baptist
Church and also visited the Bronx.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Votes For Lawmakers  </HEADLINE>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- The economy is showing double-digit growth but
Hong Kong residents are as unhappy as they have ever been with
their leader -- which analysts say could hurt pro-government
candidates in Sunday's legislative election.
</P>
<P>
   The plunging popularity of Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa -- and fallout from two recent scandals -- also could create
apathy among the territory's 3 million voters, causing many to skip
the ballot altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes people more cynical about our politicians and more
alienated from politics,'' said Lau Siu-kai, an analyst at Chinese
University.
</P>
<P>
   Among Hong Kong people who plan to vote, 62 percent are
dissatisfied with Tung's performance -- a new low for the former
shipping tycoon, according to a survey released this week by the
Hong Kong Transition Project 2000. The poll, conducted by local
academics, had a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong residents give far higher marks to the performances of
mainland China's communist leaders, President Jiang Zemin and
Premier Zhu Rongji, the pollsters say.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates spent Saturday pressing the flesh and talking to
local media in their last chance to woo votes in Hong Kong's second
legislative election since it reverted from British to Chinese
sovereignty three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong will fill all 60 seats of its Legislative Council on
Sunday, with voters selecting 24 lawmakers, special interests
choosing 30 and a committee selecting six. The council is often
attacked as having too little power.
</P>
<P>
   Tung's popularity has plummeted to new lows after a series of
administrative blunders and controversial changes in housing and
education programs, and in many ways it has hung over the election.
</P>
<P>
   With two years left in office, it's unclear whether Tung will
seek another term. He has served as Hong Kong's leader since the
July 1997 handover.
</P>
<P>
   But political scientist Michael DeGolyer at the Hong Kong
Baptist University said Tung must polish his image if expects to
run again. The 60 new legislators will be members of the 800-strong
committee that chooses the next chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got to get his public support if he goes for a second
term, or there's going to be trouble,'' DeGolyer said.
</P>
<P>
   An investigative panel at the University of Hong Kong recently
examined charges that a political pollster was pressured to stop
taking surveys of Tung's low popularity. The pollster, Robert
Chung, said he was warned that Tung was unhappy with the surveys.
</P>
<P>
   The panel found that two academics had pressured Chung, after a
top Tung aide raised questions about the polls, and called the
aide, Andrew Lo, a ''poor and untruthful witness.''
</P>
<P>
   The academics stepped down Wednesday, but Tung has defended Lo.
Opposition lawmakers are demanding the next legislature launch a
more thorough inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Another blow came when the major pro-Beijing party seen as being
aligned with Tung's government -- the Democratic Alliance for the
Betterment of Hong Kong -- ran into trouble when a newspaper
reported its vice chairman had leaked confidential government
documents to a client of his public relations firm.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Cheng stepped down from his party post, but his name
appears atop a slate of DAB candidates on Sunday and analysts
predict the party will lose some of its previously fast-growing
support.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Test Comes in the Field  </HEADLINE>
By TIM SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- When the speeches are over at the
Millennium Summit, when the world's leaders have gone home and the
limousine-clogged streets around the United Nations are clear, it
will be in places far from Manhattan's sleek East Side where their
grandiose promises will be tested.
</P>
<P>
   It will be in countries like Congo, where months of effort to
get a U.N. force mobilized across the sprawling nation has yielded
little more than a few dozen monitors in isolated pockets. And in
Sierra Leone, where the world's largest peacekeeping force faces
attacks by a rebel movement whose brutality strains belief. And in
country after country ravaged by poverty, illiteracy and disease.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the promises come.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will spare no effort to free our peoples from the scourge
of war,'' U.N. members pledged Friday in one segment of the
eight-page declaration that capped off the three-day summit of
presidents, prime ministers and kings, with some 150 countries
committing themselves to a slew of good intentions from poverty
eradication to reversing the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Money, manpower, decades of experience. The United Nations has
all that and more to wage war with the world's ills. But the
challenges are often even greater.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the talk at the summit was about Africa; its wars, its
poverty, its battle with AIDS. It is in Africa where the world
body's resolve will face the greatest test and an entire section of
the concluding Millennium Declaration was devoted to ''meeting the
special needs of Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a dismal record of failure in Africa on the part of
developed world that shocks and shames our civilization,'' British
Prime Minister Tony Blair said in his U.N. address.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of sub-Saharan Africa can seem intractable. Glossy
U.N. reports open up to a depressing statistical litany of
sub-Saharan life: more than one in six children die before age
five, the per capita gross national product is less than $2 a day
and just over half the adult population is literate.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting those troubles is an army of U.N. employees, from
paper-shuffling bureaucrats to medical staff who venture deep into
the Sahara to machine-gun carrying soldiers who nervously watch
over the road leading into Freetown, the capital of war-ravaged
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, these U.N. missions face everything from official
stonewalling to lack of funds to international squabbling over
their role and their performance.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the challenges can be far worse. In the Indonesian
territory of West Timor, a mob stormed a U.N. office earlier this
week, slaughtering three foreign relief workers and three other
people.
</P>
<P>
   But even when the United Nations faces up to its challenges, it
seldom gets much credit.
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, the last four months have seen the United
Nations go from an embarrassing debacle where nearly 500 of its
peacekeepers were taken captive by the brutal Revolutionary United
Front Rebels to a comparatively aggressive series of confrontations
with the country's armed groups.
</P>
<P>
   But few in Freetown are impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.N. peacekeepers, in the face of the escalating violence,
now look like helpless spectators,'' sneered Umara Fofana, a
48-year-old businessman in Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations can be easy to ridicule. It can be wasteful,
its bureaucracy is slow-moving and its dramatic failures are
replayed over and over by the world's media.
</P>
<P>
   But the world body is simply a reflection of its members, an
international agglomeration of wildly divergent views, demands and
capabilities. Making any decision can be a serious challenge. Even
the eight-page Millennium Declaration -- essentially a compendium of
calls for a better world -- took weeks of negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   It's a system that encourages rhetoric, and has become
accustomed to seeing that rhetoric overwhelmed by reality.
</P>
<P>
   In Congo, a plan to send a 5,500-strong observer mission has
been stalled for months by repeated government stonewalling and a
sometimes-virulent campaign in the Congolese press to discredit the
United Nation's work. Instead, the two-year civil war continues to
flare, and the country remains divided among various rebel factions
and the government.
</P>
<P>
   When unarmed observers did deploy to the rebel-held city of
Kisangani, they quickly found themselves retreating under fire as
soldiers from Rwanda and Uganda -- which support competing rebel
groups -- waged a bloody battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been frustrating so far,'' acknowledged Theophilus
Biriyai, a 32-year-old Nigerian U.N. human rights officer based in
Kinshasa, the Congolese capital. ''I should be monitoring human
rights violations in the entire country and I could not deploy.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's because of staff like Biriyai that the United Nations
wins some of its battles -- successful peacekeeping deployments in
Mozambique and Namibia, for example, and a dramatic fight against
polio -- even if the New York rhetoric is largely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the United Nation's bureaucratic and waste
problems are replicated in the field, there are also thousands of
U.N. employees who keep working despite constant roadblocks. Many,
like Biriyai, forgo the normalcy of homes and families. In
Kinshasa, much of the U.N. staff are relegated to lives of
four-star drudgery, desperately hoping to be deployed but stuck in
the city's garish hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Biriyai doesn't tell her relatives back in Nigeria much about
her life, she doesn't want to worry them. But she sees a reason to
keep trying.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have the feeling I am doing something noble.''

By DILSHIKA JAYAMAHA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANDARAWELA, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Overlooking vast tea gardens and
flower farms, a tin-roofed building on a small hill echoes with the
laughter of boys playing an unusual game of charades.
</P>
<P>
   One gestures as if plowing a rice field.
</P>
<P>
   Another playmate hazards a guess: ''He is digging a mass
grave.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No,'' says another. ''He is bayoneting a half-dead soldier,''
</P>
<P>
   The boys are former Tamil Tiger child soldiers who have either
surrendered or been captured in the civil war that has savaged
parts of Sri Lanka for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   To an Associated Press reporter and photographer who were
allowed by the Sri Lankan military to visit the rehabilitation
camp, the youngsters tell of being lured into action by videos
depicting Tamil heroism, of planting mines and of going on
reconnaissance missions. One boy speaks of missing his mother's
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Once freed from detention, they are caught in a limbo. They can
try to live in the Sinhalese-dominated south as Tamil outsiders
under constant suspicion, or move back to the Tamil north and risk
punishment for abandoning the fight for a Tamil homeland on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   According to the United Nations, more than 300,000 girls and
boys aged under 18 are involved in fighting in more than 30
countries, and their plight will be highlighted at a weeklong
conference beginning Sunday in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian government agencies are playing host to the
International Conference on War-Affected Children. Of the 50
children coming to the conference, 25 are from countries involved
in wars: Sierra Leone, Angola, Rwanda, Colombia, Sri Lanka,
Cambodia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Israel and Burma.
</P>
<P>
   In Sri Lanka, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have admitted
only once to using child fighters. During a 1998 visit by Olara
Otunnu, U.N. representative for Children in Armed Conflict, they
said they would stop recruiting fighters aged under 16.
</P>
<P>
   But the independent University Teachers for Human Rights, a
group of Tamil intellectuals, accused the rebels in July of forcing
boys and girls as young as 10 to serve as fighters and of torturing
those who refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Why children? Because children make good soldiers, says Henrik
Haggstrom of the Swedish chapter of Save the Children, who has
worked for more than 10 years with militias that use children.
</P>
<P>
   Modern lightweight weapons enable kids as young as 10 to be
efficient killers. They can carry bombs and infiltrate enemy lines.
Adult soldiers are reluctant to shoot children.
</P>
<P>
   There is no credible estimate of how many child fighters are
with the Tamil rebels. But the Sri Lankan military says it often
finds one or two bodies of children among 10 to 15 rebel corpses
after a battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamil Tigers are outlawed in Sri Lanka. Their office in
London asked that questions be faxed but did not reply to them.
</P>
<P>
   In the rehabilitation center, among tea and farms growing
marigolds and roses, are 34 former child fighters, now aged 14 to
20.
</P>
<P>
   ''Smile. Sad faces are only good for begging,'' says a poster
hanging on a wall at the center.
</P>
<P>
   The charades were organized by James Thompson, a British drama
lecturer who runs trauma counseling workshops in Sri Lanka. He
didn't mention war, just asked the boys to act out whatever they
pleased.
</P>
<P>
   The Sri Lankan military gave the AP access to all the boys, but
only two would talk, and they would give only a first name.
</P>
<P>
   Jeyashanthan, a slim young man in a T-shirt, pants and slippers,
stood under a mango tree and spoke haltingly of his recruitment,
occasionally trying to change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was 14 in 1994 when ''annas,'' or big brothers, as he
called the rebel recruiters, came to his village in Achchuveli in
the northern Jaffna peninsula. They put on a video show of
modern-day battlefield exploits and epics about the invasion of Sri
Lanka by India's Tamil kings centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made up my mind and told my mother,'' said Jeyashanthan. ''I
was picked up by another group of 'big brothers' and taken to a
training camp where I found 300 others like me.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw his parents and 10 brothers and sisters only once
more over the following six years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I missed the tasty rice and curry my mother cooked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the camp, we had to wake up at 4:30 a.m.,'' he said. ''At
daybreak we had to assemble and pledge allegiance to Vellupillai
Prabhakaran, honesty and the cause of Tamil Eelam.'' Prabhakaran is
the Tamil Tigers' leader. Eelam means homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first few weeks were terrible. Many of us could not stand
the physical training. But the 'big brothers' told us pain will
bring liberation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no freedom in the movement. No music, no commercial
films, no swearing or smoking,'' said Jeyashanthan. Drugs and sex
were also banned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Later they gave us training with weapons and use of land
mines,'' he said. ''The commander- 'big brother' would stand in
front of a blackboard and write down the do's and don'ts. They made
dummies using straw and would tell us to use them as targets.''
</P>
<P>
   After three months of training, Jeyashanthan said, he got his
first assignment, to join half a dozen other kids reconnoitering
military camps.
</P>
<P>
   In late August 1998, Jeyashanthan said, he reconnoitered the
town of Kilinochchi. A month later the rebels attacked it. About
900 soldiers and guerrillas died during the two-day battle.
</P>
<P>
   Jeyashanthan insisted he never shot or killed anyone. ''I wasn't
involved in direct shootouts,'' he said. But he would not say
whether the mines he planted killed anyone.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1999, Sri Lankan troops raided a rebel camp near
Kilinochchi and captured him.
</P>
<P>
   He was brought to the rehabilitation center in Bandarawela, a
town of 60,000 people 120 miles east of Colombo, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one knows I am here,'' said Jeyashanthan. The rebels, he
said, ''will shoot me, kill me, if I go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bhavan, slim and tall and looking older than his 19 years, said
he was one of three brothers and was given to the guerrillas by his
family at age 16. ''The rebels asked each family to give one child
toward the cause. So I joined.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was captured by the army last December as he tried to
get his family out of rebel territory. They were separated and he
does not know their fate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was never bothered by the hard life or fear of death when I
was with the 'big brothers.' But what I missed was my lonely
mother,'' Bhavan said. His father, a farmer, died when he was 10.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he received a letter from his mother asking him to
come home to help the family financially, as the rice crop had
failed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I debated whether to tell the 'big brothers' about this, or
just flee. I was worried they might not believe me, so I escaped
during an operation,'' Bhavan said. He hid in a thicket and when
his group advanced to attack, he turned back and ran.
</P>
<P>
   The army caught him. ''I was questioned and occasionally beaten
for 2 1/2 months, when I was in army custody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know why, but one day the questioning stopped and they
brought me here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bhavan said he has studied carpentry. The boys stay up to one
year at the center and leave with papers explaining their
background, said an officer, Capt. K. Abeyratne.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they are sometimes arrested at military checkpoints by
soldiers who believe the documents are fake.
</P>
<P>
   Bhavan said he has no idea where he will go when he leaves the
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be no end to the whole thing until both sides talk
peace and come to a settlement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he added: ''What's the point in living?''

<HEADLINE> Three more birds, 7 mosquito more pools test positive for West Nile virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Three more birds and seven more mosquito pools
have tested positive for the West Nile virus, a city health
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the birds were found in Queens and a third was discovered
in the Bronx, Deputy Commissioner of Health Benjamin Mojica said at
a news conference with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Of the mosquito
pools which tested positive, four were in Brooklyn and the rest
were in Staten Island, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the recent findings, more spraying has been
scheduled against the virus-carrying mosquitos.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Queens are scheduled to be sprayed starting at 10 p.m.
Saturday, and spraying is to be done in Queens, Brooklyn and the
Bronx on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the mosquito season continues, New Yorkers should continue
to take personal protection measures against mosquitos, including
wearing protective clothing, using mosquito repellent containing
DEET, and making sure that window screens fit tightly to keep
mosquitos from entering people's homes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, eight city residents have been struck by the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly and those with weakened immune systems have the
greatest risk of infection. Symptoms include a fever, headaches and
body aches, although severe infections can result in encephalitis,
an inflammation of the brain, or meningitis, an inflammation of the
brain's lining and the spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, seven people in the metropolitan area died from
virus-related symptoms and scores more were hospitalized.

<HEADLINE> French Fuel Still Scarce  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French truckers began lifting nationwide blockades
at oil refineries and fuel depots Saturday after union leaders
unanimously called for an end to a six-day protest that has
strangled fuel supplies, causing airport delays and chaos at gas
stations.
</P>
<P>
   With a majority of France's gas stations still dry, however, the
removal of blockades was not expected to ease immediately the
plight of motorists, who have had to line up bumper-to-bumper to
fill their tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry said 30 oil refineries and fuel depots
were still blocked as of Saturday evening, compared with more than
100 earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   French trucker group UNOSTRA called on members Saturday to
remove blockades, saying union leaders had accepted a deal offered
by the French government to cut taxes on fuel.
</P>
<P>
   UNOSTRA, the nation's second-largest trucker group, was the last
of the three unions leading the protests to call for an end to the
action.
</P>
<P>
   ''The administration of UNOSTRA, together with myself, decided
to lift our blockades,'' union president Daniel Chevalier said. He
added that regional union leaders would immediately begin work to
disperse rank and file members from blockades around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after the National Federation of Road
Transport, the country's largest trucker union, accepted the
government's deal late Friday. A third and smaller union had
accepted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   France's leftist government offered Wednesday to give truckers a
5-cent reimbursement per liter of fuel this year, and a 3.5-cent
refund per liter on gasoline taxes next year. Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin, under pressure from Green Party members of his coalition,
vowed that no further concessions would be made.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday, the protests by France's three main trucking
groups have drawn international attention to the difficulties they
face as world fuel prices soar. They say France's gasoline taxes --
the second-highest in the 15-member European Union -- aggravate the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Many French motorists have sympathized with the plight of those
whose livelihood depends on gasoline. One liter of diesel fuel in
France costs $2.84 per gallon, nearly twice the price of such fuel
in the United States. Fuel prices here have jumped about 40 percent
in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Truckers were joined in protests by farmers, ambulance drivers,
taxi drivers and several other groups that rely on fuel to do their
job.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture unions urged members on Friday to end their protests
after leaders emerged from late-night negotiations with Agriculture
Minister Jean Glavany saying they were satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the government offered farmers a 30 percent
decrease in gasoline taxes for the year 2000, said Luc Guyau,
president of the National Federation of Agricultural Workers, known
as FNSEA.
</P>
<P>
   Following Saturday's call to end remaining protests, truck
drivers and farmers in the Rhone region and in the north near the
France-Belgian border were among the first to clear blockades at
oil refineries and fuel depots. In the south, blockades in the
Alpes-Maritime region were also lifted.
</P>
<P>
   In the western Brittany region, however, hardline truckers
maintained protests at five fuel depots. Militant truckers have
clung to early demands for a higher tax-cut than the government
offered.
</P>
<P>
   The protest was still being felt across France, with some
airports canceling flights because of lack of fuel.

<HEADLINE> Some Connecticut doctors willing to assist suicide  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Some Connecticut doctors are complying with requests
by patients
to write lethal prescriptions, while many more would consider
writing deadly prescriptions if they were legalized, a study found.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The study, published in the July issue of the state medical
society journal, Connecticut Medicine, found that 83 state-licensed
doctors admitted they had written at least one lethal prescription
over their careers. Of some 160 Connecticut doctors asked by
patients to write lethal prescriptions in the preceding year, two
dozen said they complied with at least one request, the Journal
Inquirer in Manchester reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If deadly prescriptions were legalized, nearly 900 physicians
would consider writing one, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on a survey mailed in September 1998 to
7,228 physicians licensed as of 1997 to practice in Connecticut.
Physicians were asked about medical interventions they believed
they should be permitted to perform if requested by a competent,
terminally ill patient.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 2,805 physicians who responded, 91 percent agreed that a
physician should be permitted to withhold or withdraw
life-sustaining medical treatment. More than a third agreed that a
physician should have the authority to write a prescription for
medication providing the means to end a patient's life, while a
quarter agreed with permitting a physician to administer a
medication for ending a patient's life.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the respondents said the most important
consideration in determining the appropriateness of assisted
suicide were the patient's pain, quality of life, and, to a lesser
extent, life expectancy. Nearly half said the risk of undetected
depression also was of great importance.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, more than 40 percent of the physicians
participating in the study were ''very concerned'' that
physician-assisted suicide ''might be used with certain
disadvantaged groups.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was authored by three people associated with the
Braceland Center for Mental Health and Aging at Hartford Hospital's
Institute for Living: Leslie Curry, its director; Cindy Gruman, its
associate director; and Dr. Karen Blank, a senior research
psychiatrist; and by Dr. Harold M. Schwartz, psychiatrist-in-chief
and vice president of behavorial health at Hartford Hospital.

<HEADLINE> Public Safety commissioner seeks to increase visibility of state police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIDDLETOWN, Conn. (AP) - State police supervisors will be
marking their unmarked cars while heading to and from work in an
effort to curb speeding and reckless driving on Connecticut's
highways during rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   Public Safety Commissioner Arthur Spada plans to distribute
magnetic signs marked ''State Police'' to about 100 upper-level
state police supervisors. The signs will be affixed to their
unmarked Ford Crown Victoria cruisers when they drive to and from
work, Spada said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has a tranquilizing effect,'' Spada said. ''It would give
us 100 extra troopers on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Spada has said he plans to make highway safety a top priority in
his administration. He already has ordered more speed traps, told
his personal driver to pull over speeders, and said he plans to ask
the legislature for more state troopers on busy highways.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Greg Senick said he has been on his way to work in his tan
cruiser when drivers in a rush inch up behind him and flash their
brights in an effort to get past him. He said he gets out of the
way and lets them pass. They have no idea he is a state police
officer until he pulls them over.
</P>
<P>
   Senick and several other supervisors who have been testing
prototypes of the signs notice that motorists rapidly adopt good
manners when they spot the marked cruisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I found was, by driving at the normal speed limits,
people did not pass me or tailgate me and drove around me more
safely,'' said Senick, executive officer for field operations.
''And that is what we are trying to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Ben Pagoni, who is in charge of the sign project, said the
department will also experiment with signs that hook onto the rear
trunk. The signs have to be removable since officers take their
cars home with them and are allowed to use them off duty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our intent is not to write tickets all day long, but to get
(drivers) to voluntarily comply,'' said Pagoni, commanding officer
of research and planning for the state police.

<HEADLINE> Stretch of Farmington Avenue has a Brighton Beach flair  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Just across the Hartford city line,
along a 1&AMP;frac12;-mile stretch of Farmington Avenue lies a passport to
eastern Europe: Russian is spoken as often as English, shops sell
smoked white fish and rye bread and rent Hollywood films translated
into Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Even the sign next to the entrance of Walgreen's bears the
Russian word for pharmacy, ''Apteka,'' printed in Cyrillic letters.
</P>
<P>
   It's where Israel Kaganovich says he feels at home while sitting
in the courtyard outside Alfred Plant Senior Citizens Housing, more
than 4,500 miles from his native Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the 97 units at Alfred Plant are occupied by Russian
speakers like Kaganovich, who emigrated from Kiev seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They are refugees mostly from Ukraine and Belarus who settled
here in the last decade through a Jewish Family Service of Greater
Hartford relocation program.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 12 years, JFS has resettled 1,731 individuals (or
662 families) in the greater Hartford area, with the majority
making West Hartford their first American home.
</P>
<P>
   More than 380,000 immigrants have come to America from the
former Soviet Union in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pleased with this home,'' Kaganovich, an 85-year-old
retired engineer, said in Russian.
</P>
<P>
   ''One night when I couldn't sleep, I didn't want to wake my
wife, so I came out here and there was another man in the same
predicament,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the neighbors, Kaganovich visits with his
daughter and her husband, and his wife's family, who all live
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very loving atmosphere,'' he said. ''We live here as
friends, peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, 86-year-old Charna Beyder leaves Alfred
Plant with her home aide, Ludmila Sedun. Sedun - who immigrated
from Odessa, Russia, seven years ago - takes Beyder, who came from
Ukraine around the same time, to visit her son's grave.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really like it here,'' Beyder says in Russian. ''But I am
sad,'' she weeps, ''because my son is dead. He had cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same block of Farmington Avenue, ''Globus,'' a store with
a Cyrillic sign, sells Russian language books, cassettes and
compact disks and offers video rentals of eastern European films
and other movies translated into Russian.
</P>
<P>
   ''We needed a Russian bookstore,'' said Yuri Fridkin, who opened
the business two years ago after leaving his job as an engineer at
firearms maker Colt's Manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   In the adjacent storefront, Fridkin runs Golden Rain Jewelry
Inc. where he sells, designs and repairs fine jewelry. Shelves on
the walls behind cases displaying gold bracelets and watches hold
''Matrushkas,'' the popular Russian nesting dolls.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, a Russian-speaking man goes to see Ada
Ustjanauskas, owner of Cosmos International Imported and Gourmet
Food, which now caters mostly to university students seeking
Pakistani and Arab groceries.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to trade in $4 worth of pennies but can't ask an
English-speaking clerk or bank teller.
</P>
<P>
   ''They come to me with their concerns,'' Ustjanauskas said.
</P>
<P>
   Ustjanauskas, who immigrated from Lithuania after World War II,
speaks several languages including Russian and Ukrainian. For years
she has mailed packages to the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In the same plaza, Delicacy, offering traditional Russian,
Ukrainian and Byelorussian foods along with staples of other
European cuisines, also sells Russian-language papers.
</P>
<P>
   The owner, Lilya Ladz, was a college professor in her native
Ukraine. When she immigrated here 10 years ago, she did not speak
enough English to get a teaching job.
</P>
<P>
   ''Opening a business was easier,'' said Ladz. A Baptist, she
adds: ''We came here for religious freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Connecticut, there are pockets of Russian-speaking
immigrants who seek to preserve their traditions and culture,
though the Brighton Beach flair of Farmington Avenue is unique.
</P>
<P>
   Some who fled the communist rule of the former Soviet Union have
left their mark in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation pioneer Igor Sikorsky, considered the father of the
helicopter industry, in 1929 moved his company, which is now a a
subsidiary of United Technologies Corp., to Stratford.
</P>
<P>
   A mile-long stretch of what is now Route 9 in New Britain is
named after Ukraine's 19th-century bard Taras Shevchenko, though
the poet never visited the city.
</P>
<P>
   Calculating an estimate of the number of immigrants from the
former Soviet Union - including Jews, ethnic Russians, Ukrainians,
Belorussians and others - is difficult without a careful analysis
of each area where settlements occurred over the century.
</P>
<P>
   Yale University Russian History Prof. Paul Bushkovitch said that
between 85 to 90 percent of immigrants from the Soviet Union before
the Russian Revolution in 1917 were Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Russian Orthodox and Ukrainian Uniat
Christians, also settled in industrial cities like Bridgeport and
New Haven. Many ethnic Russians, Ukrainians and Belorussians who
survived WWII came to America from displaced persons' camps in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In one New Haven neighborhood, for example, the population of an
old synagogue resettled to Woodbridge, said Bushkovitch. There was
also a Uniat church and a Russian Orthodox church, but the
population has since moved to other areas including Stratford and
Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to break down the ethnic populations would be to
track all the synagogues and churches in those areas to determine
what groups lived where and when, said Bushkovitch.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Russians, Ukrainians and Jews were all in this sort of
area,'' said Bushkovitch. ''None of these populations were huge.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Kaganovich living in the small, tight-knit community
here seems cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a great community center,'' at Alfred Plant where he
enjoys playing cards with other residents, he said. ''We call it
Carnegie Hall.''

<HEADLINE> Arab-Americans Criticize U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gift shop owner Anwar Mohamed of Orlando,
Fla., alleges that on a trip to Israel two years ago, he was
falsely arrested, tortured, then released without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   He still is pressing the State Department to explain why U.S.
officials did little to help him. He contends it is because he is
of Arab descent, and they do not want to ruffle relations with
Israeli allies.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed, 28, said consular officials visited him twice during
his 40 days in a Jerusalem jail. ''I begged them,'' he said. ''I
showed them my hands swollen from torture. ... I told them I was
innocent. ... I told them I needed help.''
</P>
<P>
   He and three other Arab-Americans with similar stories are to
meet with State Department officials and about a dozen senators
this week to protest what they say is unfair treatment by the U.S.
and Israeli governments. They also are seeking the release of 10
Arab-Americans they say remain imprisoned in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Fox, a spokesman at the Israeli embassy in Washington,
said he was not familiar with the case of the four men. But, he
added, ''We have a Supreme Court ruling in Israel which forbids all
kinds of torture, and that is being strictly followed.''
</P>
<P>
   That decision, in September 1999, said the Shin Bet security
service cannot use physical force as an interrogation tool, as had
been done in questioning thousands of Palestinians detained over
the years on suspicion of anti-Israeli activities.
</P>
<P>
   Partners for Peace, a private group that monitors treatment of
Palestinian-Americans, says 16 Arab-Americans were arrested and
tortured in Israel in the past 18 months. Some were released later
without charges, the organization said, but some were sentenced to
prison without trials.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis contend arrests were for various security-related
crimes, such as spying or terrorist links, Partners for Peace
president Jerri Bird said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The State Department has a foreign service manual that details
what's to be done when an American citizen is detained in a foreign
country, and in no case -- no case that I have looked at -- have the
requirements been followed,'' Bird said.
</P>
<P>
   In Tel Aviv, U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz said Saturday
that consular officials ''have had access to all American prisoners
in Israeli custody, and the issue of the mistreatment of American
citizens was raised by American officials at very high levels with
the Israeli government.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz added that the embassy knows of no torture cases since
the 1999 Supreme Court ruling on torture.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's World Wide Web site posts a travel
advisory to U.S. citizens that if arrested in Israel for alleged
security violations, they ''may be prevented from communicating
with lawyers, family members or consular members for lengthy
periods of time, ... subject to mistreatment during the
interrogation period, ... detained for up to six months at a time
without charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird, wife of a retired foreign service employee once posted to
Israel, has pressed the department on the Arab issue for two years
and brought Mohamed and others to the department a year ago to give
statements on their ordeals.
</P>
<P>
   She identified others coming this week as Yousif Marei, manager
of an Islamic center in Chicago; Bashir Saidi, an engineer from
Inkster, Mich.; and Mike Mansour, deputy sheriff of Albuquerque,
N.M., when he was tortured for 21 days in 1984. All, like Mohamed,
say they were visiting relatives in Israel when they were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the very minimum there should be protest, a public
statement of disapproval,'' Bird said.

<HEADLINE> Acting Hartford fire chief received improper cash payments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - City officials say the acting fire chief
and other firefighters received improper cash payments while
overseeing out-of-town authorities during exercises at a fire
training building.
</P>
<P>
   City Manager Saundra Kee Borges ordered an internal
investigation on Friday, saying Acting Fire Chief Charles A. Teale
Sr. and other firefighters were wrong to take the money.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Teale and the others accepted $40-per-hour fees
for acting as ''burn masters'' at the multistory, concrete training
building, where fires are set for exercises. City rules prohibit
the fees from being paid directly to supervising firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Teale said he did not know the practice, which has gone on for
at least nine years, was wrong. He offered Friday to repay the
money that he and the other firefighters received, estimating the
total at thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't think they were doing anything wrong,'' Teale
said. ''They saw it as a past practice. Their intentions were
honorable. Members wanted to help improve training in other
departments.''
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money the firefighters collected was unclear.
Officials said the violations occurred at least 20 times.
</P>
<P>
   Kee Borges said city employees are not supposed to accept
private payments.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot use public facilities for private gain,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kee Borges said she will not consider disciplinary action until
after the investigation is finished.
</P>
<P>
   Teale, 45, is an 18-year department veteran who was expected to
be named as the permanent fire chief.
</P>
<P>
   ''He made a mistake, but I don't think it will impact his
chances to be the permanent chief,'' Kee Borges said. ''We have to
look at the sum total of his career and the good things he has done
since he has been acting chief.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the payments surprised other city officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes he goofed, obviously,'' said Councilman Steven M. Harris,
chairman of the public safety committee and a retired fire
department captain. He said he never heard of such payments during
his time in the department.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to review the investigation, but my sense, knowing
Chief Teale, is that it wasn't something done maliciously for his
own gain,'' Harris added.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Michael P. Peters, a retired city firefighter, would not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Teale said firefighters who took the payments did not receive
overtime or regular pay from the city during the training
exercises.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Army Seen Breaking Down  </HEADLINE>
By SLOBODAN LEKIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- This week's unchecked rampage by
militiamen in West Timor is being seen as the strongest evidence to
date that the chain of command in Indonesia's once monolithic army
has broken down.
</P>
<P>
   And now, diplomats and others warn that the violence is a threat
to keeping the nation united as it builds a new democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia soldiers have done nothing to stop attacks by
militiamen that began last Wednesday with the fatal stabbing and
beating of three United Nations workers whose bodies were burned in
the street.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fragmentation of the Indonesian military has reached the
point that they have difficulty controlling the situation in Timor
and elsewhere,'' Harold Crouch, an expert on the Indonesian armed
forces at the Australian National University in Canberra, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign diplomats speculated that the murders of the U.N.
workers was orchestrated by army hard-liners to humiliate reformist
President Abdurrahman Wahid and persuade Western governments to
withdraw their support for his increasingly ineffectual
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. workers were slain just hours before the opening of the
U.N. Millennium Summit, a major global summit in New York, where
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, President Clinton and other leaders
criticized Indonesia -- in the presence of Wahid -- for not
preventing the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, whose embarrassment was evident, has often accused
elements of the military of instigating violence to destabilize his
11-month old government as it struggles to keep Indonesia together.
</P>
<P>
   Since Wahid assumed power, the land of 17,000 islands and
hundreds of ethnic groups stretching across an area the length of
the United States has been wracked by repeated outbreaks of mayhem.
Thousands have been killed in Aceh, Sulawesi, the Maluku islands,
West Papua and West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's army formed the main pillar of former President
Suharto's 32-year dictatorship, which collapsed in 1998 amid public
unrest over the country's economic slump.
</P>
<P>
   During Suharto's reign, the army exercised tight control,
repressing all opposition and using force to ensure the unity of
the ethnically, religiously and racially disparate archipelago. It
committed extensive human rights abuses and earned lasting enmity
from large sections of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, himself an army general, rewarded the army's loyalty by
appointing senior officers to key government posts and the
rubber-stamp legislature. Retired generals became provincial
governors, ambassadors and managers of state enterprises. The
army's 14 regional commanders enjoyed autonomy, controlling an
extensive network of lucrative businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But the fortunes of the army, which accounts for about
two-thirds of Indonesia's 300,000 military personnel, weakened
after Wahid's election last October.
</P>
<P>
   He moved quickly to rein in the army by appointing navy admirals
and air force generals to top command positions and abolishing the
doctrine of ''dwifungsi'' -- or dual function, which allowed the top
brass to meddle in the workings of the government.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Wahid fired the powerful security minister, Gen.
Wiranto, after he was accused of being responsible for the
destruction wreaked by Timorese militiamen on East Timor after that
province voted for independence a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, a faction of Suharto loyalists within the
military has been gradually reclaiming some of the lost political
clout.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the parliament surprised many by passing a
constitutional amendment granting blanket amnesty for past human
rights abuses and another extending special legislative seats for
the military until 2009.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-liners also have been able to weed out reformist army
generals appointed by Wahid to top positions, replacing them with
more compliant commanders.
</P>
<P>
   The International Crisis Group, a nonprofit group based in
Brussels, Belgium, devoted to finding peaceful way to resolve
conflicts, said in a report last week that regional commanders in
Indonesia often ignore orders from the central government in
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some retired officers continue to influence serving officers
to carry out activities, including aggravation of social conflict,
to undermine the stability of civilian government,'' it said.

<HEADLINE> Student activities on hold as district and union officials negotiate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - School and teachers' union officials
bargained over a contract Saturday as student games and practices
were canceled for the weekend following a teachers' strike.
</P>
<P>
   The school board met around 9:30 a.m. Saturday to begin the
negotiations. Four hours later, spokesman Andrew Maddigan would not
discuss details of the talks. ''But we're optimistic and hopeful we
will be able to come close to an agreement this weekend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The strike took place Thursday, and was called less than an hour
before the start of school, forcing the cancellation of what would
have been the second day of classes for 47,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of children and their parents were already headed to
school and work and parents were left scrambling to find child
care.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's 3,800 teachers reported to class Friday after union
leaders asked them to show a ''sign of good will'' following a
pre-dawn meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But Superintendent Marion Canedo had already told students to
stay home because of uncertainty over the teachers' plans, so
teachers spent the day cleaning classrooms and developing lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday afternoon, Buffalo Teachers Federation president
Philip Rumore told reporters that state mediator Adam Kaufman, from
the Public Employment Relations Board, had directed the sides to
bargain around-the-clock and to refrain from speaking to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Maddigan said Friday that the talks had shifted from each side
submitting a new offer to be digested by the other side. Instead,
the ''subtle nuances'' of some of the key issues are being
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Rumore has said that teachers would not bend on their demand for
pay raises of 3.5 percent in four out of five years.
</P>
<P>
   The district's latest offer reported Friday contained
across-the-board yearly raises of 2 percent in three out of four
years.
</P>
<P>
   The strike violates the state's Taylor Law which forbids public
employees from striking. Teachers could face fines of two days' pay
for every day off the job.
</P>
<P>
   The union also face additional penalties for violating an order
issued Wednesday by state Supreme Court Justice Kevin Dillon
barring the union and four of its officers from engaging in a
strike or other illegal job actions.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers' latest contract expired in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   If school is to be closed again Monday, the district will let
parents know today, Maddigan said.

<HEADLINE> Russian TV Network Cancels Broadcast  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Tensions over the battle for control of Russia's
only nationwide television network escalated Saturday as the
network canceled the broadcast of its influential and controversial
political commentator Sergei Dorenko.
</P>
<P>
   The ORT network, whose initials stand for ''Public Russian
Television,'' has been gripped over the past week in a feud between
tycoon Boris Berezovsky, who controls 49 percent of ORT's shares,
and the Kremlin, which owns the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, who is believed to exert considerable influence over
ORT's programming, has been increasingly in conflict with President
Vladimir Putin's government in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   He accuses the Russian government of trying to pressure him into
surrendering his holdings in ORT and says government officials were
moving against him and threatening possible reprisals because of
critical coverage of the government in his media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he announced he would transfer control over the
shares to 14 people, mainly journalists including Dorenko, in what
he said was an attempt to keep the shares out of government hands.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement reported by Russian news agencies, ORT general
director Konstantin Ernst said he ordered the Saturday broadcast of
Dorenko's weekly program off the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the increasingly complex situation, I made the request to
anchor Sergei Dorenko to refrain from commentary in today's edition
of his program on the theme of the conflict between the state and
private shareholders ... Sergei Leonidovich did not agree with
me,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Interfax news agency quoted Dorenko as saying that
''there was no kind of appeal to me from the side of Konstantin
Ernst regarding my program.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I connect the decision to take my program off the air
exclusively with Vladimir Putin,'' he was quoted as saying. It was
unclear when broadcasts of the program would resume.
</P>
<P>
   ORT once had given blanket, favorable coverage to Putin.
Dorenko's program was seen as a major contributor to the collapse
of the presidential ambitions of former Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, whom many had seen as potentially Putin's strongest
challenger, and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   However, Berezovsky apparently has lost the insider influence in
the Kremlin that he cultivated under former President Boris Yeltsin
and he has become increasingly critical of Putin. He resigned his
seat in the lower house of parliament, saying he was protesting
what he called Putin's attempt to impose authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics allege that Putin is cracking down on press
freedoms. The issue got much attention this summer when tycoon
Vladimir Gusinsky, whose media holdings have reported critically on
the Kremlin, was jailed on charges of defrauding the state --
charges that later were dropped.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Barak Meet in New York  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- With Mideast peace talks deadlocked, President
Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak met Saturday to
discuss whether the negotiations can be salvaged.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just kind of a friendly meeting,'' Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   The president gave a thumbs-up sign but did not comment when
reporters shouted to him about the meeting, which lasted about an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Both U.S. Israeli officials played down the meeting's
significance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was really informal. ... It was not terribly substantive,''
said White House deputy press secretary Jake Siewert, adding that
Clinton wanted to say goodbye to Barak. Both leaders had come to
New York for the U.N. Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, a senior Israeli official said he had low expectations
of reaching a deal with the Palestinians in the coming weeks and
did not believe that Clinton was bringing new proposals to Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went to Barak's hotel on Central Park for the midmorning
meeting, in deference to the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   Barak on Friday summed up peace efforts with the Palestinians in
two words Friday: ''No good.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak told The Associated Press he made a last-ditch approach to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat before Arafat left for Gaza, and
urged him to reach an accord in the little time remaining before
next week's self-imposed deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was not responsive, Barak said with evident
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are hung up mostly over Jerusalem. Arafat is
unyielding in his demand for sovereignty over the eastern part of
the city and has resisted compromises offered by Clinton and
pleadings by Barak that the Palestinian was missing an opportunity
to gain statehood.
</P>
<P>
   In Gaza City, the Palestine Liberation Organization's Central
Council was to meet Saturday to consider whether to move forward
with a unilateral declaration of statehood Wednesday as Arafat has
indicated he would do absent an overall settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other U.S. officials
have cautioned Arafat they would not support such a state.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday is the deadline that Barak and Arafat set last year
for overall agreement. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart has
called that deadline ''artificial'' and says Clinton is prepared to
keep working past it for an accord.

<HEADLINE> State Assembly fixture faces stiff opposition in primary  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Crystal Peoples rides her ''Peoples
Express'' bus through Buffalo's neediest neighborhoods with the
hope it will eventually take her to Albany, straight to the state
Assembly seat now occupied by Arthur Eve.
</P>
<P>
   After 34 years, Eve has no intention of giving up that seat.
</P>
<P>
   And so the candidates - she the majority leader of the Erie
County Legislature, he the deputy speaker of the Assembly and its
longest-serving member - do battle in the streets for the right to
represent this piece of New York virtually untouched by the
economic prosperity evident elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Eve is one of several legislative veterans facing
harder-than-usual challenges in Tuesday's primary prelude to
November's elections. Other well-known names also campaigning hard
to beat back intraparty challengers include Democratic Assemblymen
Clarence Norman and Roger Green, both of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's three-way Democratic primary in the 141st Assembly
District, Eve points proudly to his 17 terms and the housing,
education and affirmative action programs he has helped deliver to
the largely African-American district.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're running on a record which our opponent cannot run on,''
he said. ''Seniority is very important. And I'm part of the
leadership in Albany, that's very important. We've been very
effective in delivering for the city and for the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no argument over Eve's record from Peoples. After
coming of age during the civil rights movement, his social agenda
was right on target, she says. But times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is no disrespect to the gentleman,'' Peoples, 48, said.
''It's just that ideas get old and sometimes they need to be
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The agenda that Mr. Eve has concentrated on for the last 34
years has been one that's based on social needs,'' she said, ''and
I think that was appropriate for the '60s and '70s and maybe even
the early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I think at some point we should have switched that to an
economic agenda,'' she said, ''one that focused on creating wealth,
creating access to jobs and creating opportunities to create
business.''
</P>
<P>
   High-level Democrats have been lining up behind the 67-year-old
Eve, including Buffalo Mayor Anthony Masiello, Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Herman Farrell of
Manhattan and Assemblyman Paul Tokasz of Cheektowaga.
</P>
<P>
   Absent big-name supporters, Peoples, who has been in the county
Legislature for five years, is campaigning vigorously in the
streets, delivering her message one-on-one to voters.
</P>
<P>
   While Eve, too, has campaigned door-to-door, he also has taken
to the airwaves with his first television ads since taking office.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no better way to communicate 34 years of
accomplishment than through television. It's just the most
effective media,'' explained Eric Eve, a Democratic strategist who
is running his father's campaign. ''And Buffalo's media market is
one of the least expensive in the country. It didn't make sense not
to.''
</P>
<P>
   While Eve has been endorsed by the city's largest newspaper, The
Buffalo News, Peoples gained momentum in the black community with
an endorsement by the Challenger, an influential newspaper Eve
helped establish 37 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Peoples lost by a wide margin to Republican Jack Quinn
in a bid for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Herbert is the third Democrat in the Assembly race.
</P>
<P>
   In other competitive primary contests Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   -In Manhattan, Democrats in the 68th Assembly District will
choose between incumbent Nelson Antonio Denis, Adam Clayton Powell
4th and two other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Denis is seeking his third term in the Assembly while the
38-year-old Powell, the son of the former Harlem congressman, is
seeking to get back into politics for the first time since 1997.
That year, Powell resigned his seat on the New York City Council
and ran unsuccessfully for Manhattan borough president.
</P>
<P>
   -Former state Sen. Pedro Espada Jr. is in a rematch with the
Democrat who took his job in 1996 in the Senate's 32nd District,
David Rosado. Rosado beat Espada by 745 votes in the 1998
Democratic primary. The district is in the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   -Norman is one of the more influential members of the Assembly,
both because of his nine terms of tenure and his position as
Brooklyn's Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   But he won by only 677 votes in a 1998 primary against James E.
Davis, and Davis is challenging Norman again this year for the
Democratic nomination in the 43rd Assembly district.
</P>
<P>
   Norman says he was distracted by other races last time and is
focusing on his own primary this time. Davis is a police officer
and a minister.
</P>
<P>
   -In the 57th Assembly District in Brooklyn, incumbent Democrat
Green was campaigning hard in his contest against Hakeem Jeffries.
</P>
<P>
   -In the 127th Assembly District, in the state's Finger Lakes
region, incumbent Republican George Winner was facing a primary
rematch - from 1978. Chemung County legislator Sidney Graubard has
been the only Republican to challenge Winner, who serves as the
floor leader of the Republican minority in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   -On Staten Island, borough Democratic leader John Lavelle is
being opposed by a Democratic district leader for the 59th Assembly
District seat being given up this year by the retiring Democrat
Elizabeth Connelly.
</P>
<P>
   -In Buffalo, incumbent Assemblyman Sam Hoyt, who first backed
former Majority Leader Michael Bragman's coup attempt against
Silver and then switched back to Silver's side, is being challenged
by Antoinette Guercio.
</P>
<P>
   -State Sen. Alfred Coppola is being challenged by Byron Brown, a
veteran of the Buffalo Common Council in the Senate's 57th
District. Brown has previously held staff positions in the Erie
County Legislature and the Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Lazio faces complaints that he may be too laid-back  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton's Republican opponent
in New York's U.S. Senate race, Rep. Rick Lazio, is under pressure
from top-level supporters to buckle down after a summer in which he
came across to some as a bit too laid back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did say to him, 'Look, I really think you've got to pick up
the pace a little bit,''' said Michael Long, chairman of the
state's small, but politically important Conservative Party which
has endorsed Lazio. ''He said he had no problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar advice on stepping up campaign efforts has come from
Republican Gov. George Pataki, according to GOP sources.
</P>
<P>
   Long's heart-to-heart with Lazio came as the congressman joined
the party leader at a Queens beach club last Sunday to shake hands
with some potential voters, ending a four-day, pre-Labor Day family
vacation in the posh Hamptons on the east end of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the vacation, a fund-raising letter from the
congressman had surfaced in which he made a pointed plea to
potential donors.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we are to reach every possible voter, I need to concentrate
my personal efforts on campaigning rather than fund raising. I must
attend rallies, shake hands with voters and make speeches to as
many groups as possible,'' the congressman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Lazio headed off on vacation, not to be spotted on
the campaign trail again until five days later when he showed up at
the beach club with Long.
</P>
<P>
   After that Lazio paid a Labor Day visit to the State Fair in
Syracuse and began a full schedule that saw appearances around the
state and out-of-state fund-raisers before heading to Washington
for congressional business. His aides have said all along that the
plan was to hit the campaign trail hard after Labor Day and
Republican leaders are hoping the pace keeps up.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also taken what were billed as vacations this summer
with her husband, sometimes joined by daughter Chelsea. But they
have been more like working vacations with well publicized
fund-raisers and public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at the State Fair in Syracuse if it felt like being on
vacation, the first lady raised her eyebrows and said: ''Sort of.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lazio was taking it too easy, it was left to Long to deliver
the message.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was with him Sunday campaigning and I thought he did very
well,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio and his aides say the candidate has been busy raising
money, putting together a staff and doing all the other things
needed to get a campaign up and running.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's in pretty good shape - not pretty good - I think
he's in good shape considering he's been at this around 91 or 92
days, not a year and a half like she has been,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He planted his trees. The trouble is he's got to get his trees
to grow faster than hers ... The biggest factor is that he didn't
have time to develop what you would call deep roots,'' the party
leader said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio campaign manager Bill Dal Col said the four-day Lazio
vacation wasn't really just vacation, given that the congressman
and first lady have their first debate coming up on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He spent two of those days in full debate prep and the other
two days with his family,'' said Dal Col, who ran millionaire
publisher Steve Forbes two unsuccessful bids for the GOP
presidential nomination. ''Believe me, with the time he's had on
the road and back in Congress voting, I am never going to begrudge
him any time with his family.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Every campaign is different,'' Pataki said when asked about
Lazio's work ethic. ''There's a big difference between public
appearances and public schedule and whether or not you're actually
working on the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got a good campaign team,'' said Pataki, who has lent
some of his own aides to the Lazio campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his late start, and complaints about his diligence,
Lazio has been running almost even with the first lady in most
statewide polls. Also, during July and August, he collected $10.8
million to her $3.3 million. Entering the final two months of the
campaign, he had $10.2 million on hand to her $7.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The value of that fund-raising work can't be overestimated, Dal
Col said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't have the resources to take on the onslaught that
she's put together, we'd get buried,'' the Lazio adviser said.

<HEADLINE> Family court decision sparks debate on behavior-modifying drugs  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN BREZOSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERNE, N.Y. (AP) - Kyle Carroll was past his twos and still not
talking. Or rather, he was speaking, but in a language that seemed
all his own. It was the first hint Jill and Michael Carroll had
that something was different about their son.
</P>
<P>
   In kindergarten, it became clear Kyle wasn't about to focus in
the classroom. A pediatrician diagnosed Kyle with Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder and prescribed a trial run of Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   That trial has lasted three years now, in the Carroll's view
long enough. But at the end of a torturous yearlong battle with the
Berne-Knox-Westerlo school district, they learned they don't have
the choice of stopping it, despite their arguments the drug is
wiping out sectors of their son's personality and turning him into
a sickly, staring, insomniac.
</P>
<P>
   Under a consent order signed by Albany County Family Court Judge
Gerald Maney in May, the couple must continue administering
medications prescribed by a physician meeting court approval. That
means unless they find a doctor who recommends taking their child
off medication, and they haven't yet, they must continue giving
Kyle Ritalin or risk losing him on grounds of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the order landmark is that Ritalin is a different
kind of medicine, part of an emerging class of pills that treat
behavior rather than disease. The Carroll's case is believed to be
the first in which the state has mandated a chemical change in
personality in a child who's not deemed homicidal or suicidal. It
raises a national question - whose decision is it to administer
behavior-modifying drugs?
</P>
<P>
   To Dr. Peter Breggin, consultant in a class-action suit accusing
the American Psychiatric Association (APA) of conspiring with
Novartis (the pharmaceutical company that makes Ritalin) to sell as
much of the drug as possible - the ruling speaks of the loss of the
most basic of constitutional rights, of mind control, of Big
Brother. Only now, he says, Big Brother is Big Business. And by
introducing youths to the notion there are biological defects in
their brains and capitalizing on the idea of a quick-fix cure,
Breggin says, the drug companies are no better than the cigarette
manufacturers now paying out millions for encouraging addiction to
their product.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side is the possibility raised by Ritalin's many
defendants - that millions of children are part of the first
generation of humans to have a medicine that allows them to focus
and succeed, both in the classroom and the schoolyard, the
microcosms of the professional world and society. Stimulant
medications can then seem as progressive as insulin or penicillin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the staunchest proponents of stimulant medications such
as Ritalin, the APA is one proponent, express surprise at Maney's
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an unusual case up there,'' said Dr. Richard Harding,
professor of clinical sociology and pediatrics at the University of
South Carolina and president-elect of the APA. Ideally, Harding
said, the decision will be made jointly between parents and
doctors, never forced.
</P>
<P>
   Breggin, author of several books on the subject, crusades
against psychotropic drugs as a whole, and calls Attention Deficit
Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ''a
fabrication.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The diagnosis is if the kid squirms in his chair, interrupts,
is sloppy - a list of things that annoy teachers and make it hard
to teach,'' he said. There's no real diagnostic evidence of ADD, he
says, none of the different colored brain clusters one sees in
cases of Alzheimer's Disease or strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Schaler, a psychologist who teaches at American
University's School of Public Affairs, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no deficiency that Ritalin is fixing,'' he says,
''what it's doing is changing a behavior so the child complies with
expectations and behaviors expected of him. You drug the child and
get him to comply by drugging.''
</P>
<P>
   Albany County Family Court, Schaler says, has invaded the
Carroll's privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he sees the decision as a fearsome precedent, an
entry into a new gray area socially, with consequences no one can
even guess at.
</P>
<P>
   ''Psychologists and psychiatrists are going back over history
saying just about every great person, every person who had some
great contribution to society had some sort of mental problem. If
you gave all those people drugs would that have stopped?'' Shaler
asks.
</P>
<P>
   Schaler, however, thinks it's wrong to blame the companies, who
are simply making a product, rather than the mindset of ''thou
shalt not have any difficulty in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is studying's hard work,'' he says. ''The
bottom line is you just have to focus and discipline yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an argument Jordan Lippman, a 22-year-old student at Union
College in Schenectady, has grown tired of.
</P>
<P>
   Until 11th grade, when he was diagnosed with dyslexia and ADD
and prescribed a cocktail of the stimulant Adderall and the
anti-depressant Welbutrin, Lippman was miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always knew I was different because I was always in
detention for forgetting my pens, forgetting my assignments,'' he
says. ''I knew I was intelligent, yet it didn't correspond to
anything. I knew the material but I couldn't make it translate into
anything like good grades.''
</P>
<P>
   Lippman's parents were well-off enough to send him to a private
high school near their home in Tenafly, N.J., where he received
plenty of one-on-one attention.
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of a personal interview and an award-winning
senior year project on Attention Deficit Disorder (the success he
says started his momentum), he was accepted to Union College, a
highly selective private college in Schenectady.
</P>
<P>
   When a test was pulled away from him before he could finish it,
Lippman realized he wasn't cutting it. He has since built a support
group for students with ADD and ADHD, and lobbied deans and the
college president. In effect, he has changed the campus climate for
those with ADD.
</P>
<P>
   His peers have been the hardest to convince. In a written debate
with Lippman that played out in the campus newspaper,
Concordiensis, a former suite mate wrote ''one of the aspects of
Union that makes it a desirable college, is that not everyone can
attend here. If a student cannot keep up with his or her peers in
the classroom, perhaps Union is not the ideal college for him or
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Lippman replied in part, ''you know that I work just as hard,
and three to four times as long as most other students here at
Union. My strengths are abstract verbal reasoning, but it is
extremely difficult for me to do the initial processing of written
language.''
</P>
<P>
   He says ADD is misnamed because it's not an attention disorder
but rather a control disorder, in which the part of the brain that
organizes and plans isn't working. He says his medication combined
with self-awareness and awareness on the part of the college has
helped him succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Lippman is now completing an internship with the New York
City-based International Dyslexic Association, boasting a 3.676
finish for the last term, and meeting with editors from the
Princeton Review to modify listings of services for the disabled
listed by colleges.
</P>
<P>
   He's impressed faculty and developed mentors, including Dr. Rudy
Nydegger, a clinical psychologist who teaches management and
psychology at the college.
</P>
<P>
   In his own practice, Nydegger advocates a therapy that
frequently includes writing prescriptions for stimulant
medications.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't look at solving problems by throwing drugs at them,
but if we can get those kids calmed down and focused then we can
help them learn techniques for managing their behavior,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And he for one is convinced ADD and ADHD have long existed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We called it other things,'' he says. ''We called kids stupid,
underachievers.''

<HEADLINE> Former prison sergeant who claimed sex harassment awarded $150,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A tearful federal jury said the state
should pay $150,000 to a female prison guard who said co-workers
and supervisors sexually harassed her for four years.
</P>
<P>
   The decision against the Department of Correctional Services
followed a one-month trial in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Georgiann Alfano, 46, of Utica, worked as a sergeant at
Mid-State Correctional Facility in Marcy, Oneida County, for six
years, until she was fired in 1994 over allegations that she
mishandled an inmate. She claims the criticisms against her were
merely retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   The award was to compensate Alfano for mental anguish and
emotional distress, said her lawyer, Michael Sciotti.
</P>
<P>
   Sciotti said five of the seven jurors were crying when they read
the verdict around 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Alfano claimed she was sexually harassed repeatedly from 1990 to
1994.
</P>
<P>
   She said supervisors accused her of simulating oral sex with a
carrot. After that, she testified, a captain barred her from eating
carrots, bananas or hot dogs at work.
</P>
<P>
   Another sergeant testified that other lieutenants and captains
laughed about the incident and that he saw jokes and derogatory
remarks about Alfano posted at the prison.
</P>

<HEADLINE> British Director Frears Honored  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Stephen Frears was a natural choice when Toronto
International Film Festival planners decided they wanted to honor a
filmmaker for the event's 25th anniversary. The trouble was
convincing Frears to agree.
</P>
<P>
   Frears, a British television director whose career swung upward
after ''My Beautiful Laundrette'' proved a hit at the festival in
1985, was gun-shy about the attention and felt such tributes tend
to signal the end of a film career.
</P>
<P>
   When festival planners first contacted Frears, his reaction was
''one of horror,'' he said Saturday in an interview before the
tribute. ''People ask to do retrospectives and you think, oh, I
see, I'm virtually dead, and I always think I don't feel I've even
started.''
</P>
<P>
   Frears has had a far-ranging career that includes the unusual
horror flick ''Mary Reilly,'' the modern western ''The Hi-Lo
Country,'' a new take on film noir with ''The Grifters'' and the
costume epic ''Dangerous Liaisons.'' The latter two grabbed
multiple Oscar nominations.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the festival did a tribute was for Warren Beatty
in 1984. Since it was the 25th anniversary for the Toronto fest,
North America's top movie showcase, organizers decided to pay
respects to a filmmaker who had a long and successful relationship
with the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to honor someone who's not at the end of their
career but someone in the middle, who's got films ahead of him,''
said festival director Piers Handling. ''It helped that he had a
really great this year, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Frears' work this year included the hit ''High Fidelity,''
starring John Cusack, the live TV remake of ''Fail Safe,'' with
George Clooney, and his latest film ''Liam,'' the story of
working-class Irish immigrants in Liverpool in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm on a good roll,'' Frears said. ''It's been a good
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Those three films kind of sum up how wide his career has
been,'' Handling said. ''A BBC drama, an experiment in live TV and
a contemporary American slacker film.''
</P>
<P>
   Frears made ''My Beautiful Laundrette'' for British television,
never figuring it had potential for a theatrical release. The movie
was a sharp commentary on racial tensions and economics in Margaret
Thatcher's Britain, centering on a homosexual relationship between
a Pakistani laundry operator and the white punk buddy he hires to
help out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Would you think it had theatrical possibilities? It's about a
gay, Pakistani laundrette owner,'' Frears said.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie was acquired at the Toronto festival for
theatrical release and became an arthouse hit. That led Frears into
bigger budget films and ultimately to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I started making films for television, I never
particularly wanted to be a cinema director,'' Frears said. ''I
certainly never thought I'd get to America. I never thought I'd get
to Hollywood. It was just inconceivable. It was as if someone said,
do you want to go to the moon?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Liam'' is screening at this year's festival, along with a
retrospective of Frears' movies that includes ''Dangerous
Liaisons,'' ''The Grifters,'' ''Sammy and Rosie Get Laid'' and
''The Hit,'' his first film to play at Toronto, back in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's lineup for the Frears tribute included Cusack, John
Hurt, who starred in ''The Hit,'' Jack Black from ''High Fidelity''
and Roddy Doyle, whose Dublin novels ''The Snapper'' and ''The
Van'' were adapted for film by Frears.
</P>
<P>
   Frears said it was a nice homecoming to revisit Toronto because
of the positive reaction audiences there have given his films.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember being told that some critic in Toronto had written
the nicest thing anyone's ever said about a film of mine,'' for
''Dangerous Liaisons,'' Frears said. ''That it was like eating
chocolate in bed.''

<HEADLINE> Businesses, towns still struggling to rebuild after devastating floods </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOUND BROOK, N.J. (AP) - Jim D'Agostino sits in one of the
fluorescent-green booths he had put back in a deli that Raritan
River floodwaters destroyed and remembers what it looked like a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went ceiling to floor,'' he said. ''We were gone.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be one year on Sept. 16 since the remnants of Hurricane
Floyd dumped historic rainfall on this town, sending the Raritan 20
feet above flood stage in the middle of a drought, filling homes to
their top floors.
</P>
<P>
   The floods killed four people around the state, including an
elderly mother and her son who refused to be evacuated from their
ground-floor apartment in Bound Brook. Damages have been estimated
at close to $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, towns say they are still waiting on money from the
federal government, the state has not distributed nearly half of a
$50 million flood relief package, and a flood control project
planned for decades in Bound Brook and more than a dozen other
towns has not yet begun.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials say their flood preparedness has changed.
New computer software installed in every county shows people when
they need to evacuate, they say. Officials talk daily with the
National Weather Service during hurricane season and monitor the
rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all watch,'' says Joe Painting, chief of operational
planning for the state Office of Emergency Management. ''We all
lean forward in the foxhole here from the first of June to the 30th
of November.''
</P>
<P>
   In hardest-hit Bound Brook, D'Agostino spent more than $125,000
to make his business successful again, but he doesn't think Bound
Brook has come back with him. He looks out his window to see empty
storefronts, crumbling sidewalks and holes where lampposts once
stood on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   He is more concerned about the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers'
$331 million flood control plan, which is to begin this fall by
raising a bridge in Bound Brook and setting up floodwalls and
levees. He says it won't prevent another flood because it doesn't
involve river dredging.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to get water again,'' he says. ''It's a matter of
when and how much.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, Phyllis Pournaras lights a cigarette in the
restaurant she owns and says the flood control project will change
this town.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once that begins, forget it,'' said Pournaras. ''This will be
prime, prime property.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bound Brook initially lost nearly half its business
district when flooded merchants decided not to return, new stores
are slowly taking their place. An eclectic cafe has taken over the
space occupied by the former Palmyra Tea room. A Chinese
restaurant, a furniture store and a barber shop have moved in.
</P>
<P>
   One recent morning, Michael Jones had several people waiting in
line for haircuts at his new shop, Mirror Image, which he opened
here because space was cheap and available.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't really worried about the flood factor,'' Jones said.
He said his inventory can easily be moved in case heavy rains
threaten.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Biniek, who owns a shoe store he spent $175,000 to repair,
says his business is up 25 percent, largely because of publicity he
received from the flood.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been on Channel 12 10 times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Carzis, one of the biggest landlords in town, has spent
from $750,000 to $1 million buying up properties vacated by timid
business owners ''selling at, I think, irrational prices.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he's rented out the properties at a 40 percent to 50
percent profit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who can count should be investing in Bound Brook,''
Carzis said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents, businesspeople and government officials are strongly
at odds over Bound Brook's future. The city and a developer are
pushing a redevelopment plan that could bring a new train station,
a hotel-conference center and perhaps a satellite campus into town.
Mayor Frank Ryan says the city needs new businesses to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Forty percent of my stores are not back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A part of the plan, however, gives the city the right to condemn
homes that lie in the redevelopment zone if the homes can't be
sold. Residents who had just spent everything to restore their
homes balked.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need to clean out that river. They don't need to tear
down these houses,'' said resident Saul Valencia. ''For what? To
build an office building nobody's going to use?''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said nothing is decided - or likely will be for several
years.
</P>
<P>
   D'Agostino said overdevelopment in Bound Brook and surrounding
towns such as Bridgewater is what brought on the flooding in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   ''That river is not made to hold the runoff we're expecting it
to take,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Corps of Engineers will start taking bids on the first
of the flood control initiatives in Bound Brook next week,
beginning a decade-long project that is expected to protect three
counties and 14 towns from heavy flooding for at least a century.
</P>
<P>
   The state gave approval to the project three months before the
Floyd flooding. Officials said it took time to secure congressional
funding and local and county approvals.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, confusion reigns about the availability of flood aid
and how much has been received. The Federal Emergency Management
Agency says it has given out $82.4 million statewide, although
government officials say it could take years to properly account
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen County hasn't received $1.4 million of the $1.7 million
it asked for from FEMA, said spokesman Thom Ammirato, who
acknowledged the problem may be about paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last year, the Legislature passed a flood relief
package that included $50 million to offer relief to residents,
businesses and counties. Just $26.2 million of that money has been
distributed, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Human Services has given out $16.2
million of $20 million set aside for resident relief, to 6,001 New
Jerseyans who applied for aid, spokesman Ed Rogan said. The state
needed to extend its deadline several times and was still unable to
distribute all the money, although Rogan said 125 applications are
still being evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $10 million for hazard mitigation has not yet been
distributed because it addresses long-term prevention needs, said
Painting of the Office of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Community Affairs has distributed half of its
$20 million set aside for counties to distribute as they wished,
spokesman E.J. Miranda said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency initially awarded amounts ranging from $500,000 to $4
million for nine counties declared federal disasters, he said. It
then only distributed half of that amount to all the counties,
telling them they could come back for more if they needed it. Only
Somerset County came back for its full $4 million, Miranda said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We definitely want it,'' said Ammirato of Bergen County, which
had been awarded $4 million but collected $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ammirato said the county will double the grants it already gave
to about 76 businesses that applied for it, then give out checks to
the Lodi Boys Club and Felician College in Lodi, where floods
destroyed the university library.
</P>
<P>
   In Bound Brook, Pournaras stood in front of the sign outside her
Bill's II restaurant and pointed to the waterline that covers the
words ''Home Cooking'' on a sign halfway up her restaurant. She has
not touched it. She is thinking about buying a building in town and
says she is better prepared for the waters that may come.
</P>
<P>
   ''This time,'' she said, ''I have flood insurance.''

<HEADLINE> Whitman defends charter school record while critics call for more oversight </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The charter school movement in New Jersey
is a healthy one, despite the closure this year of two of the
innovative schools due to financial mismanagement and other
problems, according to Gov. Christie Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   But critics wonder whether the state is doing enough to monitor
the largely independent, publicly funded schools.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-four charter schools enrolling about 12,000 pupils remain
following the April closure of the REACH Charter High School in Egg
Harbor Township and the Sept. 1 shutdown of the Simon Bolivar
Charter High School in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a charter school is not going to meet the needs of the
children, we're not afraid to say they can't go forward because the
most important thing here is the children,'' the governor said last
week in touring a successful charter school in Red Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Despite closing two charter schools this year and putting four
others on probation, Whitman said the state has an ''overwhelming
record of success'' awarding charters and monitoring the new
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Harold R. Edwards Sr., chairman of Bolivar's Board of Trustees,
cares to differ.
</P>
<P>
   He complained that the state Department of Education was lax in
overseeing his one-year-old school's original founders, whom he
termed ''unscrupulous.'' Edwards took over as board president in
March, apparently too late to fix the school's shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel strongly that had the state done their job right from
day one, we would not have this problem in the first place,'' he
said after being told of the state's action.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Education Association also is dubious of the
state's claim.
</P>
<P>
   While the powerful teachers' union supported the 1997
legislation creating charter schools, it has since cooled to the
idea. In December, it released a report concluding that the quality
of education in some of the schools has been weakened by
profiteers, inadequate resources, high staff turnover and
ineffective state oversight.
</P>
<P>
   The closure of two schools in a year is a sign that the state
needs to better monitor the remaining schools, said NJEA
spokeswoman Lynn Maher.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have some real reservations about whether the state will
oversee them very closely,'' she said. ''They have no elected
school boards to do that, so it's the state responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The REACH school was the first to lose its charter. State
officials at the time said it had accumulated more than $1 million
in debt, employed uncertified teachers, lacked adequate education
plans for disabled students and violated a host of other minimum
state requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolivar school suffered from similar problems. State
officials said it had a debt of as much as $900,000, on an
operating budget of less than $2 million. It also had not secured a
new building for the 2000-2001 school year a week before the first
day of classes, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards denied both charges, and plans to appeal the state's
action.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she stands behind Education Commissioner David
Hespe's decision to close the school.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it was a tough one. They worked very, very hard with
that school to make sure it would be ready for opening day and it
just wasn't going to happen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been worse had the state allowed the school to
open as scheduled, then closed it weeks later and disrupted the
students' routine, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, more than 500,000 children attend 2,000-plus charter
schools operating in 33 states and the District of Columbia,
according to the Center for Education Reform, an education think
tank that advocates school choice.
</P>
<P>
   States have revoked about 40 charters, most of them for
financial reasons, according to Jim DeLaney, director of the
Charter School Research Center, an independent group that assists
New Jersey charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   While New Jersey regulations spell out various criteria that
must be met before a school's charter can be revoked, state
officials also use their best judgment before using that power,
said Assistant Education Commissioner Jeff Oskowski.
</P>
<P>
   Both the REACH and Bolivar schools were prime candidates for
closure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In both cases, we gave them every benefit of the doubt. We
gave them time and clear guidance on what the problems were,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivar's financial picture was so bleak that it could not
afford textbooks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers who want to start a new charter must submit a
comprehensive application detailing their mission statement,
financial plan, facility arrangements, curriculum, degree of
parental involvement and admissions policy.
</P>
<P>
   They must then prepare annual reports showing how they are
meeting their goals. State education officials also conduct onsite
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The state also investigates tips that children don't have books,
teachers' pensions are not being paid, or local building inspectors
are not granting school occupancy permits.
</P>
<P>
   Like four other schools, REACH and Bolivar were first placed on
probation. Unlike the four others - the Golden Door Charter School
in Jersey City, the Classical Academy in Clifton, the Jersey City
Community Charter School and the Englewood Charter School - they
failed to abide by the state's probationary requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Despite weeks of badgering by state officials to submit a plan
to clear up school debt, Bolivar officials waited until the last
day of probation and offered only a a one-page document outlining
vague plans to hold fund-raisers, Oskowski said. The school was
closed the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Oskowski said he sympathizes with Edwards that problems may have
predated his arrival on the school board, but that does not
diminish the urgency of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   DeLaney visited both the REACH and Bolivar schools to assess
troubles there during their probationary periods.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not surprised that the state revoked the Atlantic
County school's charter, as the situation there was ''very dire.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolivar had financial troubles almost from the start, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was also almost nomadic looking for sites. They had to move
around a lot. That caused a lot of problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State education officials did the best they could for both
schools, and do a good job monitoring all the charters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were also some people in the charter schools who did the
best they could, some really well-meaning, talented people, but it
just didn't work out,'' DeLaney said.
</P>
<P>
   Charter school founders are often teachers or parents who have
little, if any, experience creating a school from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   While a cottage industry of advocacy groups with their own Web
sites and publications detailing start-up tips has sprung up in
recent years, organizers still run into problems, Oskowski said.
Those commonly include finding affordable classroom space, managing
a budget and finding board members with the time to run the school.
</P>
<P>
   Successful ones overcome the obstacles by involving lots of
parents and hiring enthusiastic teachers with good attendance
rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It takes guts, perseverance, enthusiasm, luck to a certain
extent, and a collaborative effort. It's a tough job,'' agreed
DeLaney.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of the success of New Jersey charter schools is the
fact that there are 3,000 children on waiting lists, Oskowski said.

<HEADLINE> Unions Urge Strike Support at Emmys  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gold ribbons will be the big fashion
accessory at Sunday's Emmy Awards if striking commercial actors get
their wish.
</P>
<P>
   The Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television
and Radio Artists, which began a walkout May 1 against the
advertising industry, urged Emmy participants to don the ribbons in
a show of support.
</P>
<P>
   Stars joined in the call to action for colleagues who toil in
anonymity in radio and TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ''People tend to have the attitude that actors are buying second
homes in Malibu and living the high life, but the great majority of
actors ... are just trying to make the house payment and put the
kids through school like everyone else,'' said Jane Kaczmarek, an
Emmy nominee for ''Malcolm in the Middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaczmarek and three other Emmy contenders -- Martin Sheen of
''The West Wing,'' Tyne Daly of ''Judging Amy'' and Jerry Orbach of
''Law &AMP; Order'' -- sent out an Aug. 28 letter asking fellow nominees
to wear ribbons and publicly express support for the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the awards show takes place three days before
negotiators for the unions and the ad industry meet in New York,
the actors said the Emmys provide ''a tremendous opportunity to
demonstrate union solidarity at this critical point.''
</P>
<P>
   SAG and AFTRA want to protect residuals, or fees paid each time
a radio or television commercial is broadcast on a major network.
Advertisers want to replace residuals with flat-fee payments.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising industry representatives were unavailable for
comment Saturday. The American Association of Advertising Agencies
has held its ground, contending the industry's offer is fair and
broad and will restructure a contract that is based on outdated pay
methodology. The offer provides a substantial increase for most SAG
and AFTRA members, the association says.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of gold ribbons have been sent by the unions to actors
and their agents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope everyone in the auditorium wears a ribbon,'' David
Hyde Pierce of ''Frasier'' said. ''With this strike in its fifth
excruciating month, it really is time for it to end.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBC sitcom's cast also asked ABC, which is airing the Emmy
ceremony, to withhold commercials featuring non-union performers
during the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ABC declined to ban non-union ads, saying the dispute was
between the unions and advertising agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Actor-comedian Garry Shandling is the host of the 52nd Annual
Primetime Emmy Awards, which features a duel between the White
House and a fictitious New Jersey crime family.
</P>
<P>
   ''The West Wing,'' the NBC series set in the White House, and
HBO's ''The Sopranos'' are competing in six categories, including
best drama and best actor (Sheen for ''The West Wing,'' James
Gandolfini for ''The Sopranos'').

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mum on Russia Military Cutback  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The United States said Saturday it views a major
reduction in the size of Russia's military force as another among a
long series of domestic and economic reforms President Vladimir
Putin promised.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the cutback Friday to 850,000 troops from 1.2
million, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said in Moscow the military
was ''preparing suggestions for the president on how to carry it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a decision for Russia to make, but it is certainly
consistent with what we have done with our military in the
post-Cold War era,'' White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something that President Putin has indicated
previously was going to be one of his priorities. It's their
decision. It's not for us to say good, bad or indifferent.''
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, the cutback was seen as an implicit admission that
the resources-strapped government no longer can afford the size of
military organization that during the Soviet era led the Warsaw
Pact against NATO's trans-Atlantic force.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been a debate in Russia about the size of their
military and the available resources,'' Crowley said. ''This
(cutback) would be consistent with other steps they are taking with
regard to domestic and economic reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States still maintains a worldwide force of roughly
1.4 million troops.

<HEADLINE> Clinton blasts opponent's labor record; Lazio says he's proud of it. </HEADLINE>
By JUDIE GLAVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Democratic Senate candidate Hillary Rodham
Clinton criticized Republican Rep. Rick Lazio's record on labor
issues before marching in the city's belated Labor Day parade on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was not at the parade, although Grand Marshal Edward
Malloy - president of the New York Building &AMP; Construction Trades
Council - said he had been invited by a local affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio insisted Malloy was wrong. ''We did not get any
invitation.''
</P>
<P>
   At a pre-parade breakfast, Clinton said Lazio had a poor record
of voting on pro-labor and pro-family issues. Quoting an AFL-CIO
rating, she said Lazio's lifelong pro-labor voting record was 33
percent and that ''last year he outdid himself'' with only a 25
percent rating.
</P>
<P>
   ''He keeps telling people they should vote for him because of
where he was born, where he grew up, where he clammed, where he
went to school,'' Clinton said, as the friendly crowd hooted in
approval. ''Well, apparently he didn't learn very much about the
history and tradition of the progressive labor movement in his
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio disputed the charges, saying, ''I have a good labor
record.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've voted for the Family and Medical Leave (Act) in my first
term in office. I voted for a ban on striker replacements. I voted
for prevailing wage and I've been a strong supporter of ensuring
that New York has gotten its fair share on transportation
formulas,'' he said. ''In construction, we put thousands of Long
Islanders back to work on projects that I delivered back for the
district, so I'm proud of my labor record.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton marched in the Fifth Avenue parade - which could
probably win hands down honors for being the quietest in the city.
She was neither booed nor cheered but received several shouts of
''Yeah, Hillary,'' and some polite applause along the 25-block
route.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Day parade has traditionally been a showcase for
political wannabes looking for exposure. It was not surprising that
most Republicans were missing since the New York City Central Labor
Council, the local AFL-CIO affiliate, has already endorsed Clinton
for the U.S. Senate and the Al Gore/Joe Lieberman ticket for
president.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton campaigned in Manhattan, Lazio spent the day
greeting Queens shoppers in Howard Beach and attending a park fair
in the Richmond Hill section where he was endorsed by maverick
Democratic Assemblyman Tony Seminerio.
</P>
<P>
   Seminerio, who has ruffled party feathers before by endorsing
non-Democrats, did not give specific reasons for endorsing Lazio
but said he did it ''wholeheartedly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate also went to Commack, Long Island where
volunteers began handing out the first of 1 million pieces of
campaign flyers and newsletters to be distributed statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani also did not attend the
parade, although a bevy of Democratic officials looking to fill his
job next year were there. They included City Council Speaker Peter
Vallone, Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, City Controller
Alan Hevesi, and Public Advocate Mark Green.
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, who has expressed interest in
running for governor on the Democratic ticket, was also on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton later attended a post-parade union barbecue on the Upper
East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Parade organizers moved the parade to the weekend after Labor
Day after failing to spark interest from marchers or spectators.
</P>
<P>
   But in this presidential election year, thousands of marchers
turned out and the public crowd was the largest in recent years,
although their numbers still hovered in the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The largest concentration of spectators was only two deep around
St. Patrick's Cathedral where Clinton, marching with Malloy and
AFL-CIO National President John Sweeney, stopped to greet
Archbishop Edward Egan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here to support the working men and women,'' Egan told
Clinton. ''It's not about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what we're here for, too,'' she responded.
</P>
<P>
   Some along the parade route didn't have a clue what they were
watching. ''Who's that? Mrs. Clinton? They're giving her a parade?
How nice,'' said German tourist Myna Leifler.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- The political party linked to the armed ETA
Basque separatist group plans to leave the Basque parliament, its
leaders proposed Saturday at the party's Assembly in the northern
town of Durango.
</P>
<P>
   Euskal Herritarrok spokesman Arnaldo Otegi said Saturday that
the Basque parliament supports only the status quo of Basque
autonomy under the Spanish constitution rather than the party's
goal of working toward independence.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-seat Basque parliament, a regional legislature, has a
high degree of autonomy from the Spanish government.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not going to work in this parliament that mainly wants
to stabilize the territorial division,'' Otegi said adding that a
final decision is now in the hands of the militants of Euskal
Herritarrok, or EH, that will either ratify or reject the proposal
in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   The Basque president, Juan Jose Ibarretxe from the moderate
Basque Nationalist Party appealed for calm and said that EH's move,
which will strip him of a majority in parliament, ''won't represent
a problem for the government as we don't have agreements with the
radical coalition.''
</P>
<P>
   EH currently holds 14 seats the parliament and is strongly
represented in many Basque city and town councils.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea May Loan Food to N. Korea  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea plans to import a large
amount of grain from foreign countries and loan it to
hunger-stricken, communist North Korea, a top government official
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Unification Minister Park Jae-kyu told leaders of South Korea's
political parties that North Korea asked South Korea to loan it up
to 1 million tons of grain during high-level government talks in
Pyongyang late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Park said, however, that the South has yet to decide on the
timing and size of the grain shipments.
</P>
<P>
   ''The North wants to get as much grain as possible and also
wants it as soon as possible,'' said Chung Kam-kyu, a ministry
spokesman, relaying the minister's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   By importing cheaper foreign rice, South Korea could provide the
North with a larger amount of food, Chung said. Until now, South
Korea has provided North Korea with only domestic rice, which is
several times as expensive as rice produced in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Local news reports, quoting unidentified government sources,
said South Korea may buy Thai rice and Chinese corn.
</P>
<P>
   Park urged the political leaders to support food loans for North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's main opposition Grand National Party opposed any
massive grain loan for North Korea, accusing the communist regime
of diverting outside food aid to feed its 1.1 million-member
military, the world's fifth largest.
</P>
<P>
   It suggested that the government first provide 50,000 tons in
free humanitarian aid, linking further shipments to actions from
the North to ease tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea wants to open a military dialogue later this month
with North Korea to ease tension. It also wants North Korea to
allow more reunions of relatives separated by the 1950-53 Korean
War in October or November.
</P>
<P>
   The two Koreas held their first summit in June and agreed to
promote economic exchanges and political reconciliation after five
decades of enmity.
</P>
<P>
   For a sixth straight year, North Korea's farm industry was
damaged by bad weather this year, forcing the country to depend on
outside aid to feed its people. In past months, North Korea has
reported heat waves, drought and floods.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul officials said that North Korea will have a worse harvest
this year than last year.
</P>
<P>
   Severe flooding and high winds brought by a tropical storm left
42 people dead in North Korea and caused extensive damage to crops
last week, David Morton, the United Nations' coordinator for
humanitarian aid to North Korea, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea needs 4.7 million tons of grains to feed its 22
million people annually, but it usually produces less than 3.5
million tons, Seoul officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1990s, up to 2 million North Koreans have died of
starvation, according to U.S. officials.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Rules Out Pact Extension  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The Indonesian government has ruled
out extending a peace deal with separatist rebels in war-ravaged
Aceh province beyond December, news reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Mahfud M.D. accused rebels of using the
cease-fire, officially known as a humanitarian pause, to stockpile
thousands of weapons and strengthen its forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''The humanitarian pause is extended only until December. There
will be no extensions for the Free Aceh Movement,'' he was quoted
as saying by The Indonesian Observer daily.
</P>
<P>
   The Free Aceh Movement is a separatist group that has been
fighting for 25 years for an independent Islamic state in the
province, located on the northern tip of Indonesia's Sumatra
island.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels reacted to Mahfud's statement by threatening a return to
full-scale war in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the humanitarian pause is not extended we will take up arms
again to return the sovereignty of the Acehnese people,'' Abu
Sofyan Daud, a Free Aceh leader in northern Aceh, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In May, government officials and representatives for the
insurgents signed a three-month truce to make way for negotiations
on the future of the province, which is home to 4.1 million people.
It went into effect on June 2.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have since met on several occasions in Geneva,
Switzerland, but there has been no word of any progress made.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire was extended for an unspecified period.
</P>
<P>
   While the deal has stemmed the worst of the violence, at least
87 people have been killed since its implementation.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday and Friday, more fighting left 12 dead, including
three policemen.
</P>
<P>
   The official state news agency Antara reported that about 5,000
people in central Aceh were preparing to flee their homes after
being terrorized by an unidentified group of armed men.
</P>
<P>
   At least 5,000 people have been killed in the past decade in the
oil-and natural resource-rich region.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Film Wins Top Venice Prize  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENICE, Italy (AP) -- An Iranian film about the tough life women
face in that Islamic state took the top prize in the Venice Film
Festival on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Circle'' (''Dayereh''), which won the Golden Lion award,
was a popular favorite after it was screened at the festival, which
began on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   It is 40-year-old director Jafar Panahi's third feature film.
His 1995 ''The White Balloon'' (''Badkonake sefid'') and 1997 ''The
Mirror'' (''Ayneh'') have won several international awards.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Circle'' tells the story of eight Iranian women struggling
with the restrictions their society places on them because they are
women. The opening scene shows a woman giving birth to a child
unwanted because she is female.
</P>
<P>
   ''I come from Iran, an ancient country .... a country with
people who love life, persons who inspire my films,'' the director
said as he clutched a statuette of a golden lion prize.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier comments about the movie, Panahi said he decided to
make the movie after noticing a small newspaper article about a
woman who committed suicide after killing her two young daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The freedom of women in Iran, he has written in the past, ''is
limited to the point where it seems as if they are in a big
prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Another film well-received at Venice was an Italian work, ''100
Steps'' (''I Cento Passi''). The film tells the story of a young
Sicilian, Giuseppe Impastato, who boldly challenged a Mafia boss
and was slain. Director Marco Tullio Giordana paid tribute to the
young man's mother as he received the award Saturday night for best
screenplay.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Juliette Lewis, who plays a surrogate mom in her
new movie ''The Way of the Gun,'' wants to be a real-life mom some
day.
</P>
<P>
   Just not quite yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very inclined toward motherhood,'' Lewis, 27, said in
Saturday's editions of The New York Post. ''And in the last year
particularly, I think about it on a monthly basis. It's a really
wild feeling. I love children.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has two new movies in the offing and says she wants to
''build up a nest egg'' before starting a family with husband Steve
Berra, a championship skateboarder who she wed a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has appeared in 30 movies, including ''Natural Born
Killers,'' ''National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,'' and ''Cape
Fear,'' for which she won an Oscar nomination.

<HEADLINE> 'Spinal Tap' Star Targets Dog Shows  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Christopher Guest's satirical films have taken
on rock 'n' roll, the film industry and small-town theater.
</P>
<P>
   His latest target? Dog shows.
</P>
<P>
   Guest, co-writer and co-star of ''This Is Spinal Tap,'' said he
had never been to a dog show before he made ''Best in Show,''
scheduled for release Sept. 29. In preparation for it, he went to
Westminster last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is intense,'' Guest told Time Out New York in its Sept.
7-14 issue. ''When some dogs came out, it could have been Prince
coming onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   Guest, who is married to actress Jamie Lee Curtis, said the
common thread in all his movies has been ''a fanaticism that
crosses different boundaries in hobbies or professions.''
</P>
<P>
   A re-release of ''This Is Spinal Tap'' opened in theaters
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Habitat For Humanity marks 100th house in Paterson  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PATERSON, N.J. (AP) - Terry Jones and her two children finally
have a home of their own.
</P>
<P>
   All it took was 500 hours of banging nails, attaching siding and
painting walls, as well as the kindness of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' new home was the 100th house built in Paterson by Habitat
For Humanity, the Georgia-based nonprofit group that counts former
President Jimmy Carter among its volunteers. At a rate of 11 new
homes a year, the Paterson chapter is one of the most productive in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Jones brushed back tears as she accepted the keys to her
two-story townhouse on Halpine Street in one of this poor city's
most impoverished neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tears of joy, because this is what I've always dreamed
of,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones previously lived in a small Paterson apartment with her
children, Imani and Tyree.
</P>
<P>
   ''The space was too small,'' she said. ''There was no room to
move around. The kids needed a backyard to run around and play
in.''
</P>
<P>
   She works for a local bank that works with Habitat For Humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'Why not take a chance and see if I can do this?' ''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat homeowners get an interest-free mortgage that they have
20 years to repay. They have to do at least 500 hours of ''sweat
equity,'' a euphemism for rolling up their sleeves and helping
build their own house.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the help, they have to meet certain requirements,
such as earning about $23,000 a year and having the ability to
repay the mortgage. Once the mortgage is repaid, the money goes
back into a fund to build other new houses.
</P>
<P>
   The Paterson chapter began working 15 years ago in the city's
Northside neighborhood, an area so bad that a road bridge linking
it with the downtown area had been closed. Crime, drugs and poverty
were rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the neighborhood is still struggling: Liquor stores and
bars dot the corners of many residential streets, and trash still
lines the curbs. Across the street from the construction site, a
row of abandoned, burned-out garages contains tons of trash. The
average income in the neighborhood is about $18,000 a year,
according to Barbara Dunn, the Paterson chapter's executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   But now there is hope, justified by the sight of clean, new
houses that have risen from the rubble of vacant lots and
fire-scarred buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we started here, this was known as the worst neighborhood
in Paterson,'' Dunn said. ''We got most of our property donated
because people just walked away from their lots.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, even Northside land is worth something. Habitat
had to pay $140,000 for the Halpine Street site, where it is
building 16 new homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's an encouraging sign,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Local churches and businesses have been helping. United Parcel
Service funded the entire $66,000 cost of building Jones' home.
</P>
<P>
   Millard Fuller, who founded Habitat For Humanity in 1976 in
Americus, Ga., and recruited Carter in 1984, said the group will
soon dedicate its 100,000th house, one nearing completion in New
York City's Harlem neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   He started the group after a personal crisis led him to question
his values.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a lawyer and a businessman, but my life was falling
apart,'' he said. ''My wife was leaving me and I was hitting the
skids. I ended up in a small religious community outside Americus,
and it was there that we built our first house.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a desire to make my life count for something other than
just piling up money,'' Fuller said. ''Building housing ended up
being what I felt God was calling me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The group has 2,500 chapters worldwide, and is active in 1,569
U.S. cities.

<HEADLINE> Castro Visits Ends in Harlem, N.Y.  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Fidel Castro's first visit to New York in five
years ended Saturday in Harlem, with 2,000 Cuban solidarity
supporters cheering, chanting his name and singing ''Happy
Birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Dear brothers and sisters,'' he told the invitation-only event
at the historic Riverside Church, hugging several children who gave
him a plastic-wrapped bouquet of flowers. ''You have been extremely
generous and kind with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the event, which began Friday night at 8 p.m. and
ended in the wee hours Saturday, Castro flew home, where he was
greeted at the airport by other top officials, including Vice
President Carlos Lage, Cuba's Radio Reloj reported.
</P>
<P>
   The church full of admiring American supporters in Harlem
erupted in applause when Castro told them about his encounter with
President Clinton earlier in the week. In a much-discussed
encounter, the two leaders shook hands Wednesday at a luncheon of
the U.N. Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel satisfied by my respectful and civilized behavior with
the president of the country that had been host of the summit,''
Castro told the crowd to applause.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Castro had publicly mentioned the event at
the summit, a gathering of about 160 world leaders. The news was
especially encouraging to Americans who support the normalization
of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his olive green uniform after spending a week in the
black suits he favors for presidential gatherings, Castro told the
crowd at the end of a far-ranging address about the details of his
first face-to-face encounter with the American president.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he found himself in a line of leaders being greeted by
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't run away to prevent passing by that point,'' Castro
said, growing animated at his speech, which early on was punctuated
by the crowd's shouts of ''Fidel! Fidel! Fidel!''
</P>
<P>
   ''With all dignity and courtesy I greeted him,'' the Cuban
president said. ''He did the same, and I moved ahead in line. It
would have been extravagant and rude to do any other thing. The
whole thing lasted less than 20 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro was clearly moved by the affection shown him by the
Americans who surrounded him, especially when they sang ''Happy
Birthday'' in belated recognition of his turning 74 in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is only because of miracles that I have survived all these
years,'' he told the crowd, alluding to the many assassination
attempts against the communist leader during his 41 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came to Harlem because I knew it was here that I would find
my best friends,'' he added. Among those in the church were U.S.
Rep. Maxine Waters of Los Angeles and U.S. Rep. Jose Serrano of New
York, and the Rev. Dr. Lucius Walker Jr. of Pastors for Peace, all
longtime opponents of the 38-year-old U.S. embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Other guests included the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, the former
head of the National Council of Churches, who campaigned vigorously
for the repatriation of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father in
Cuba, even bringing the boy's grandmothers to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Riverside Church is an institution in Harlem, where it
played a major organizing role in the civil rights movement of the
1960s. It was from this pulpit that the late Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. spoke out against the Vietnam War and was one of South
African leader Nelson Mandela first stops in America after his
release from prison a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Castro has great fondness for Harlem and black Americans in
general, having first visited the neighborhood during a 1960 trip
to the United Nations for that year's General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Refused at the Shelburne Hotel in midtown, the delegation of
bearded guerrillas who had recently assumed power on the island
moved to Harlem's Hotel Theresa. Thousands of Harlem residents
crowded the streets to cheer them.
</P>
<P>
   There, Castro met with black leader Malcolm X, and met
separately with then-Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Gamal Abdel
Nassar of the United Arab Republic also paid his respects to Castro
at the hotel, which has since been torn down.
</P>
<P>
   Castro returned to Harlem during his last visit to New York in
1995, when he addressed the General Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Fogerty at Peace With Tribute Band  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Creedence Clearwater Revival frontman John
Fogerty used to bristle at the idea of a tribute band playing his
classic rock tunes.
</P>
<P>
   But Fogerty now insists he's no longer angry about the cover
group Creedence Clearwater Revisited, which features two original
members of CCR and a new singer who apes Fogerty's growling vocals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used to have stronger feelings about it. I thought I could
keep the name Creedence kind of virginal,'' Fogerty said. ''It's
more sadness than anything. But I can't do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fogerty and Creedence Clearwater Revival were favorites of the
late 1960s, known for such folksy hits as ''Proud Mary,'' ''Born on
the Bayou'' and ''Fortunate Son.'' The band split in 1972 at the
height of its fame.
</P>
<P>
   Fogerty is now touring with New Orleans soul queen Irma Thomas
and jazz-funk pianist Dr. John.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Rebels Release Four Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEBU, Philippines (AP) -- Military helicopters lifted four
European hostages from a southern Philippine jungle Saturday in a
dramatic end to their 140 days of captivity at the hands of
extremist Muslim rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Government negotiators called in the helicopters following a
bloody ambush of two go-betweens en route to remote Jolo island.
One of the go-betweens' bodyguards was killed and eight others were
wounded in the attack, negotiators said. Many civilians were also
injured, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a really very challenging day,'' said chief
negotiator Robert Aventajado. ''It was like going through the eye
of a needle. At least at the end of the day we ended up
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The tourists' flight to freedom came after they were released by
the Abu Sayyaf rebels, who say they are fighting for an independent
Islamic state in the mostly Roman Catholic Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf still have 16 other hostages, including two
French journalists, 13 Filipinos and an American, who was being
held by a separate faction of the same rebel group.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators said rising violence on Jolo and growing tensions
within the Abu Sayyaf over the sharing of millions of dollars in
ransom are likely to complicate efforts to gain the French
journalists' release.
</P>
<P>
   The gaunt, bearded former captives beamed Saturday as they
stepped down from their helicopters in Zamboanga city, where they
were presented to their ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest hostage, German Marc Wallert, 27, raised both arms
as he disembarked.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels great of course,'' said Wallert, whose mother and
father were released earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Wallert said his 20 weeks in captivity were ''hell'' and he had
doubted until the last minute that his release would happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''The day was indescribably dramatic,'' Wallert said in an
interview with Germany's ARD television shortly after his release.
When a car came to take him and three other European hostages to
freedom, ''I was expecting we were just being moved to a new
camp,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, Wallert's parents rejoiced when told of his release.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the happiest day of my life,'' his father, teacher
Werner Wallert, said in the family's hometown of Goettingen. ''But
I'll only believe he's free when I see him at the helicopter.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Wallert, Stephane Loisy of France and Finns Risto
Vahanen and Seppo Juhani Franti were released Saturday. All were
kidnapped April 23 from Malaysia's Sipadan diving resort.
</P>
<P>
   The former hostages were to spend the night in central Cebu city
before flying to the Libyan capital of Tripoli aboard a Libyan
plane.
</P>
<P>
   In Libya, two celebrations were planned, the first at Tripoli
airport and the second elsewhere in the Libyan capital, said Saleh
Abdel Salam, a member of the Gadhafi International Association for
Charitable Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, which played a leading role in the
negotiations, paid $1 million for the freedom of each of the
hostages, negotiators said. An earlier group of released hostages
also flew to Libya.
</P>
<P>
   But not all of the former captives were happy about the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like that I have to become this kind of clown yet
again in Tripoli,'' Franti said. ''I want to go home to take care
of my life. I have spent half a year in that hell and in constant
fear of death. The past five months have made me older than 10
years would have in normal conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Libya, which reportedly paid $6 million 10 days ago for the
release of six other hostages, has resisted paying for the French
journalists still in captivity, saying their company should foot
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac, speaking by telephone with the
families of Jean-Jacques Le Garrec and Roland Madura, reaffirmed
''France's determination to obtain their freedom as soon as
possible,'' the presidential palace said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel happiness and also sorrow for those who were left
behind because we know what a hell it was,'' released hostage
Vahanen said. ''Mentally it has been really straining. Luckily no
one committed suicide, but it was not far away.''
</P>
<P>
   In Helsinki, Vahanen's sister, Riitta Alitalo, cried for about
15 minutes when she heard the news of his release, her husband Kari
said.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder voiced relief and thanked
Libya for its efforts to win the hostages' release. ''It proved
right that the German government insisted on a peaceful solution.
Our patience was rewarded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Ghalib ''Robot'' Andang, the leader of the rebel
faction holding the hostages, backed out of a promise to free all
of the Europeans, instead offering only three. Government
negotiators refused, canceling the release.
</P>
<P>
   Andang was worried about a military assault if all the foreign
hostages are freed, Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado said he told Andang that an attack was unlikely as
long as the rebels are holding a group of 12 Filipino Christian
evangelists.
</P>
<P>
   The evangelists were seized in early July when they visited the
rebels' camp to pray for the hostages. A Filipino resort worker,
the last of 21 hostages seized at Sipadan, is being held at another
camp.
</P>
<P>
   A separate faction is holding an American, Jeffrey Schilling,
who was kidnapped Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, 24, a Muslim convert from Oakland, California, was
seized when he visited a rebel camp with his Filipino Muslim wife,
Ivi Osani. Osani, who is the second cousin of rebel spokesman Abu
Sabaya, was not abducted.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have not announced their demands for Schilling's
release, although Sabaya has privately demanded $10 million,
negotiators said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Presses For Wildfire Aid  </HEADLINE>
By OWEN S. GOOD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton proposed spending about $1.6
billion to help communities recover from the forest fires that have
scorched the West this summer and to thin millions of acres of
federal forests in hopes of preventing future blazes.
</P>
<P>
   A report submitted Saturday to Clinton by two Cabinet
secretaries said the increased removal of trees and brush is needed
to reverse almost a century's worth of firefighting policy that
left forests with acres of undergrowth and ready-to-burn timber.
</P>
<P>
   ''For almost 100 years, our nation pursued a policy focusing on
extinguishing all wildfires,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio
address, broadcast from New York, where he attended the U.N.
Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''''It was well-intentioned, but as a result, many of our
forests now have an unnatural buildup of brush and shrubs. This
excessive undergrowth fuels forest fires, making them far more
dangerous and difficult to control.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also announced the release of nearly $40 million for 90
restoration projects across the West, where fires have charred 6.5
million acres and 38 large fires continue to burn across nine
states.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal led environmentalists to worry that
stepped-up thinning could reopen federal land to large-scale
commercial logging.
</P>
<P>
   Also, congressional Republicans said they would have to weigh
Clinton's request against other spending priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP is ''committed to looking at all options,'' said Rep.
J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the House's fourth-ranking Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho Republican Larry Craig, chairman of the Senate
Agriculture's forestry subcommittee, said the report ''contains
some important initiatives that suggest'' the Clinton
administration officials ''have at last recognized that our
nation's publicly owned forests are not healthy and that this
forest health problem is contributing to our current wildfires.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes a hearing before his subcommittee this week will
provide more details on Clinton's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service will thin 2.4 million acres this year.
The report from Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman recommends an additional $257 million next
year for clearing.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials could not provide estimates of the
acreage to be thinned in the future, although a draft report called
for removing 16 million acres of brush over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said most of the efforts will be directed at smaller
trees and encouraging the timber industry to use them.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a relatively new development, but some very innovative
things are going on,'' Babbitt said of the commercial harvesting of
the trees, between 6 inches and 7 inches in diameter. The report
said wood from small-diameter logs can be used for housing material
and as filler in plastic composites.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rub here is that whenever they say they can make it ...
viable, that means taking larger diameter trees, because that's the
only way the timber industry will take part,'' said Mike Bader,
executive director of the Alliance for the Wild Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   But a logging industry representative, Stefany Bales of the
Idaho-based Intermountain Forest Association, said the proposal was
''an opportunity for everybody ... to figure out how to reduce
forest density.'' She also played down the loggers' interest in
using the thinning program as a way to harvest large diameter
trees.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck, speaking at a Denver
environmental conference sponsored by The Wilderness Society, said
timber removal ''is going to be very, very tightly controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   Bader and other environmentalists have said thinning should be
restricted to areas bordering communities and homes, not deep into
remote forests.
</P>
<P>
   The government report said 89 million acres of National Forest
System land are at ''moderate to high risk of catastrophic fire.''
Of these, less than 16 percent is in ''roadless'' areas.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Agriculture Secretary Richard Rominger, whose department
oversees the U.S. Forest Service, said thinning would involve
mechanical removal of trees and controlled burns. ''We're planning
to increase both, but the mechanical clearing would be increased
more than the set fires,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said he and Glickman intend to discuss the plan with
Western governors this week in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recommended increasing overall spending for wildland
fire programs to $2.8 billion, an increase of nearly $1.6 billion.
The increase also includes about $770 million to replenish federal
fire suppression accounts, which have been depleted by this year's
extraordinary costs, and to repay emergency transfers from other
accounts.

<HEADLINE> 103-year-old Olympian to return flag ''borrowed'' in 1920  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Hal Prieste grabbed a souvenir after he took
a bronze metal in the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 103-year-old Camden man is traveling to Sydney,
Australia, to present the president of the International Olympic
Committee with the Olympic flag he ''borrowed'' after the closing
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Prieste said he's returning it because ''the Olympic committee
wants it back.''
</P>
<P>
   He left his nursing home with two companions Friday afternoon
and began the 36-hour journey to Sydney, taking along the white
flag bearing five colored Olympic rings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very pretty with lots of rings in it,'' Prieste told the
Courier-Post of Cherry Hill. ''What good is it doing me (stored) in
a suitcase?''
</P>
<P>
   He was 23 years old when he took third place in platform diving
in the Olympics. To this day, Prieste still regrets that he didn't
perform better.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did three compulsory dives from 16 feet and finished
in last place.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then we went up to 32 feet and they let you do whatever you
wanted,'' he said. ''You could get more points by doing harder
dives. I did the hardest because I wanted to get the most points.
</P>
<P>
   ''I only lost by a couple of points. If I did better on the
compulsory dives, I probably would have won.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking the flag and stuffing it in a suitcase, Prieste
returned to California, where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   He used his fame to grab a silent-movie part as one of the
original Keystone Kops and traveled to Hawaii to perform diving
exhibitions for the Amateur Athletic Union.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932 Prieste formed a traveling comedy show to coincide with
the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. He later performed his physical
comedy act at dance halls and nightclubs nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never copied off anyone,'' Prieste said. ''I was a creator.
I would make things up and people would laugh and laugh. I had my
name in lights in New York City, on Broadway. 'H. Prieste,' it
said.''
</P>
<P>
   He later took up ice skating and joined a version of the Ice
Follies, which he enjoyed more than diving.
</P>
<P>
   Now he said it's time to give the flag back, and he's happy to
make another trip to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is he the oldest U.S. Olympian, but Linda Nevarez of
the U.S. Olympic Committee's Alumni Relations department said he's
also the oldest Olympic medalist in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will just about finish me up,'' Prieste said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Barak Discuss Peace  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton met with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak Saturday as the United States signaled
determination to salvage Middle East peace talks despite a grim
outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side made much of the significance of their midmorning
get-together, at Barak's Central Park hotel in deference to his
observance of the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   Before the meeting, an Israeli official said he expected no new
ideas from Clinton on how to revitalize talks with the
Palestinians. After the session, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright characterized it as ''just kind of a friendly meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, White House spokesman P.J. Crowley, in New York
with Clinton for the United Nations' Millennium Summit, said
despite the lack of progress, the peace process continues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coming out of New York I think we have a good understanding of
where both parties are. Both parties remain committed to the
process, and we're committed to help,'' Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton's separate meetings last week with Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat ''gave us a better understanding
of where both sides are, and we'll continue to formulate ideas
designed to help the parties close the gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton emerged later from lunch at a midtown delicatessen,
he gave reporters a thumbs-up sign but did not respond as they
shouted questions about the meeting, which lasted about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was unavailable for comment Saturday, but on Friday, he
summed up peace efforts as ''No good.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak told The Associated Press he made a last-ditch approach to
Arafat before the Palestinian leader left for Gaza, urging him to
reach an agreement in the little time remaining before Wednesday's
self-imposed negotiating deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, headed home for a meeting of the Central Committee of
his Palestine Liberation Organization, was not responsive, Barak
said. The committee was to decide whether to postpone a unilateral
declaration of statehood, which Arafat has said he would do without
a Sept. 13 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   He has been under intense international pressure to delay.
Israel has threatened to annex parts of West Bank and the Gaza
Strip if he goes ahead, and he was expected to back off. In Gaza,
as 250 demonstrators outside held signs saying ''Yes for
independence now,'' Arafat told Palestinians to prepare themselves
for the worst -- possible confrontation with Israel -- if the
committee should decide to make the declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are hung up mostly over Jerusalem. Arafat is
unyielding in his demand for sovereignty over the eastern part of
the city and has resisted compromises offered by Clinton and
pleadings by Barak that the Palestinian was missing an opportunity
to gain statehood.

<HEADLINE> Khatami to US: Change Behavior  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami,
returning from the U.N. Millennium Summit in New York, said
Saturday that the United States should recognize Iran's new words
and change its behavior toward this Gulf country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that the world has accepted that Iran has something new,
fresh and logical to say, the U.S. should recognize it, too,''
Khatami said of efforts he has made since being elected in 1997 to
open Iran to Western nations. He spoke to reporters upon his
arrival at Tehran airport from a weeklong trip to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami was warmly welcomed by dozens of senior Iranian
officials and thousands of youths carrying flowers and pictures of
their president.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
attended Khatami's speech during the summit. But, Khatami said,
''this does not solve the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ''America's behavior should be basically changed. They should
compensate for the problems they have created in the past,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami was not invited to a reception hosted by Clinton later
in the week. The leaders of Iraq, Libya and Cuba were also
excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Ties between Iran and the United States were severed after
Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, when militants stormed the U.S.
Embassy and kept 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. Iranians resent
U.S. support for the shah, whose regime was toppled in the
revolution, as well as the American role in a 1953 coup that ousted
a nationalist government.
</P>
<P>
   Relations have thawed since the election of the reformist
Khatami, who has sought better relations with Western countries.
The United States has taken some concrete steps in the area of
trade and people-to-people contact, but Khatami said in his U.N.
speech that Iran still had ''serious issues'' with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, Khatami said he met with Algerian
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika on the sidelines of the U.N. summit
and the two agreed to resume full political relations. The
countries suspended relations in the early 1990s after Algeria
accused Iran of aiding Muslim militants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a very good meeting ... and we announced the resumption
of ties, which had unfortunately been in trouble for many years,''
Khatami said.

<HEADLINE> 2,000 Colombians Protest Drug Plan  </HEADLINE>
By JUAN PABLO TORO
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUERTO ASIS, Colombia (AP) -- About 2,000 people, including
schoolchildren and farmers, protested Saturday against a
U.S.-backed anti-drug offensive that is being planned for this
cocaine-producing region.
</P>
<P>
   Security forces brandishing assault rifles and grenade launchers
kept a close eye on the demonstration in the main plaza of this
sweltering Amazonian town. One child held a cutout of a dove with
the word ''peace'' written across it. Another held a sign that
read: ''Don't kill us -- we are the hope of Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   Many demonstrators said they feel threatened by President Andres
Pastrana's ''Plan Colombia,'' which the United States is supporting
with $1.3 billion in mostly military aid and is aimed at
eradicating drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, elite U.S. soldiers are training Colombian
troops. Ferried aboard 60 combat helicopters provided by the United
States, Colombian soldiers are to seize Colombia's vast
coca-growing areas, which are protected by leftist rebels and rival
right-wing paramilitary squads, and allow their fumigation by
airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Farm leader Eber Sanchez said the simple mention of the name
Plan Colombia strikes fear in farmers in the area, located near the
Ecuador border, about 350 miles south of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   ''Between 30 and 40 families have already fled the region,''
Sanchez said. His claim could not be immediately verified, but
thousands of people are expected to be displaced when the
counter-drug offensive gets fully underway next year.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees have
already visited the Ecuador border region, and are considering
building a camp to hold some 5,000 Colombian refugees.

<HEADLINE> Huge advertising fight under way to decide control of House  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - In a battle of unprecedented size and
sophistication, Democratic and Republican campaign committees are
lavishing money on television commercials in key races two months
before elections that will determine which party controls the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists in both parties agree that as few as three dozen of
the 435 races around the country will be competitive. A switch of
eight seats would guarantee a Democratic majority next year.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats began airing their ads in July. Republicans, stripped
of their customary election-year financial advantage, started their
campaign only in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both sides are ahead of the spending pace set in previous
campaigns. In addition, virtually all ads are now tailored to the
political landscape in specific districts, a contrast to the
proliferation of ''cookie-cutter'' productions in 1996 and 1998 in
which essentially identical commercials aired in a number of races.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue advertising this (election) cycle has started
earlier, it will last longer, it's in more places with more depth
than any time'' previously, said Ed Brookover, a former top aide at
the GOP campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Issue ads'' refer to commercials that do not expressly
advocate election or defeat of a candidate and are distinct from
any advertising undertaken by the candidates themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Democrats are paying for a commercial praising Rep. Mike
Forbes, D-N.Y., as a champion of breast cancer research. In
another, they accuse GOP Rep. Ernie Fletcher of Kentucky of voting
''for a budget that raided Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   In a third, they charge GOP Rep. Don Sherwood of Pennsylvania
with voting ''against guaranteed prescription drug coverage for all
seniors under Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have invested in a commercial that lauds Rep. Jay
Dickey in Arkansas as the architect of a plan to provide
prescription drug insurance for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   They also attack Maryanne Connelly, a Democrat running for New
Jersey's 7th District seat, for turning the city of Fanwood, where
she was mayor, ''into Taxwood.'' Connolly is running against
Republican Mike Ferguson for the seat being vacated by Republican
Senate candidate Bob Franks, a district that includes parts of
Union, Somerset, Middlesex and Essex counties.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, where the GOP nomination will not be settled until
October, the party is conducting a political holding action. They
are on the air attacking Democrat Linda Chapin, former chairwoman
of the Orange County Commission, for supporting local tax
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are airing advertisements in roughly a dozen
districts, although Democrats got a jump on the GOP of up to
several weeks in many cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to spend a ton of money'' on issue ads, said Rep.
Tom Davis, R-Va., the chairman of the House GOP campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful about record Democratic fund-raising, Republicans
launched a new effort over the summer to persuade rank-and-file
lawmakers to donate surplus campaign cash or raise funds from
supporters for the GOP advertising effort.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats already have spent millions on ads. With eight weeks
remaining in the campaign, Democratic officials say they are
already closing in on the $6.8 million they spent in all of 1998 on
issue advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to be able to play in all the districts where we
need to, and that's light years ahead of where we were in the last
two (election) cycles'' said Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., chairman
of the House Democratic campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   In a striking display of their financial resources, Democrats
are paying an estimated $1.6 million for a two-week run of a pair
of 15-second ads on television in New York City, one of the
nation's costliest markets. The message is aimed at voters on Long
Island and New Jersey, only a small percentage of the stations'
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats launched their first ad almost two months ago, in a
bid to help Adam Schiff, a state senator, unseat GOP Rep. Jim Rogan
in California. They quickly followed up in a second California
district, targeting GOP Rep. Steve Kuykendall, as well as
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans scoffed that Democrats were spending their money too
early in the campaign to be effective. At the same time, they
attacked some ads as untrue, succeeding in having a few pulled from
television stations, however briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the effect was to send a wave of jitters through the
ranks of vulnerable lawmakers, and, Republicans now concede, to
depress GOP poll numbers in a few places.
</P>
<P>
   The intense use of issue ads by party committees is a relatively
new political phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and the Democrats employed them in the run-up
to the 1996 campaign, attacking Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, the AFL-CIO used them to try and topple the GOP
majority in the House. Republicans responded, at a cost that
officials say was a few million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Republicans spent an estimated $20 million on issue
ads, some relating to legislative issues and some dealing with
Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans and Democrats alike, this year's process is
similar.
</P>
<P>
   Party strategists in Washington use polling data to determine
where the commercials will run and how much to spend. They also
provide direction on the topic involved, according to officials in
both parties. Advertising experts, two for the Democrats and five
for the Republicans, produce the commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, an ad might carry an on-screen disclaimer that says
it was paid for by a state party. In fact, the funds generally are
transferred from the national committee in Washington, the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee or the National
Republican Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The money itself is a blend of hard money, which can be raised
in donations limited in size, and soft money, which can be raised
in unlimited contributions.

<HEADLINE> Baby Buried Found Alive in S.C.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFAX, S.C. (AP) -- A newborn baby was found clinging to life
hours after it was buried in a shallow grave just outside the
town's trash dump.
</P>
<P>
   Police got a call for help Friday morning and found the little
boy about two hours later, said Police Chief John R. Sullivan. He
said he believed the infant had been buried for at least four hours
before rescuers pulled him from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Lord was looking out for him,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   A nursing supervisor at Palmetto Richland Memorial Hospital in
Columbia wouldn't release any details about the boy's condition
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The baby was found under about 3 inches of dirt and lime,
Sullivan said. As the dirt was pulled away from the baby, an
emergency services worker noticed a pulse. ''That was a shock,''
Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the recovery effort initially was hampered because a
suspect would not cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We finally got cooperation from the mother,'' Sullivan said.
He would not say if she was the suspect or identify her or the
child. He also would not say who placed the call for help.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests had been made Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Fairfax is a town of about 2,300, about 75 miles south of
Columbia.

OPEC Nations Support Oil Increase
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- As international pressure mounts on OPEC to pump more
oil to stem surging fuel prices, members of the petroleum producers' cartel said
today they support raising their official output by at least half a million
barrels a day. Oil ministers from Iran and Algeria said they would back an
increase of 500,000 barrels a day -- or 2 percent above OPEC's current
production -- when they meet with their counterparts at a crucial meeting
tomorrow. Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali Naimi went further, suggesting that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would add ''at least'' that many
fresh barrels to thirsty world markets.

US Mulls More Colombia Anti-Drug Aid
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House leaders are considering whether to follow up a $1.3
billion aid package designed to help Colombia's military combat the narcotics
trade with $99.5 million more to bolster Colombian police anti-drug efforts. In
negotiations over the original package, which emphasized military aid,
congressional Republicans already switched 14 helicopters and other materiel to
the police. John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, said today
that Hastert saw a possible need for additional help when he accompanied
President Clinton to Colombia on Aug. 31 for the symbolic delivery of the first
package.

Clinton Presses For Wildfire Aid
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton proposed spending about $1.6 billion to
help communities recover from the forest fires that have scorched the West this
summer and to thin millions of acres of federal forests in hopes of preventing
future blazes. A report submitted today to Clinton by two Cabinet secretaries
said the increased removal of trees and brush is needed to reverse almost a

Presidential Race Tightens

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrat Al Gore has an edge over Republican George W.

Bush still has a big lead in Texas, according to several new state polls. The

<HEADLINE> Man gets five years in prison for killing autistic son  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) - A 73-year-old man has been sentenced to
five years in prison for stabbing his autistic son to death in a
nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   James Joseph Cummings and his wife asked the judge not to send
Cummings to prison, pleading that he took his son's life out of
fear no one would take care of James Jr. after his father no longer
could.
</P>
<P>
   But Superior Court Judge James A. Kennedy said taking a life
must have consequences, no matter what the conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Cummings) weighed the risks and opted to take his son's
life,'' the judge said. ''But no matter how lofty the motive, this
can't be condoned. The so-called mercy killing has not been
sanctioned by the people of New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, Cummings visited James Jr. in his room at the
Avante nursing home in Red Bank, where the 46-year-old was being
treated after suffering a stroke that left him partly paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Cummings stabbed James Jr. in the chest, walked to a
nursing station to announce what he had done and waited for police
to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   When the nursing home employees went to the son's room, they
found James Jr. had died of a stab wound to the chest. Cummings was
charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Cummings pleaded guilty to manslaughter, and the
prosecution agreed to recommend the minimum sentence of five years
and to dismiss the murder and weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, Cummings must serve four years and three
months. The 298 days he has already served in jail will count
toward the prison sentence. Kennedy said he plans to recommend that
Cummings is placed in an institution where he can receive
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   About 12 family members listened in court as Theresa Cummings
described the difficulties of raising a son that doctors wanted
them to put in an institution. She told the judge she didn't
condone what her husband did, but believes he had no control over
his actions.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Cummings' attorney, Mitchell Ansell, said the
family was disappointed and thought he should have been spared a
prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Monmouth County Prosecutor Mark Fliedner said after
the sentencing that his office worked closely with the family to
come up with a just solution.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a devastating family tragedy from every perspective,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Aide: No Vote Observers  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Yugoslav government will not
allow observers from Western countries considered hostile to
President Slobodan Milosevic to monitor elections here, a top
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection, which comes amid fears of possible vote-rigging
in the Sept. 24 election, is meant ''to protect Yugoslavia's
sovereignty and integrity,'' Information Minister Goran Matic said.
</P>
<P>
   He also blasted government critics who had warned of fraud as
''delegates of American institutions whose aim is to occupy our
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Matic spoke at a news conference at the headquarters of his
neo-communist Yugoslav Left party, a powerful group led by the
president's wife, Mirjana Markovic, and coalition partner with
Milosevic's Socialists.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is running for re-election. His main challenger,
Vojislav Kostunica, who is representing a group of allied
opposition parties, currently leads independent polls by more than
10 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Matic accused the foreign media in Yugoslavia of preparing to
discredit what would be a certain Milosevic victory.
</P>
<P>
   The information minister also accused the Belgrade-based,
non-governmental organization, Center for Free Elections and
Democracy, of being an ''instrument of American agents'' working to
undermine Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the police ransacked the group's premises, also known
by its Serbian-language acronym CESID. They confiscated much of its
equipment, including computers with files.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's ruling coalition had earlier said it will invite a
number of foreign observers of its own choice, mainly from China,
Ukraine, Russia and India.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia now consists of Serbia, Milosevic's power base, and
the much smaller republic of Montenegro, whose separate,
pro-Western government is boycotting the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's supporters in Montenegro say they will organize
voting in the republic, raising further questions of manipulation
in the president's favor.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday evening, the supporters went further. Their leader,
Momir Bulatovic, who also serves as the federal prime minister,
rejected any form of supervision or monitoring by the republic's
government.
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic's statement, made at a rally near Montenegro's capital
Podgorica, violates a tentative agreement made earlier by
supporters and opponents of Milosevic that the government would
provide polling stations for those who wish to vote on condition of
adequate monitoring to ensure fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rejection of (election) control shows they are preparing
ground for the biggest scam in the recent history of this region,''
said Miodrag Vukovic, a top Montenegrin official. ''Milosevic is
ready to do anything just to avoid losing the elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's supporters in the U.N.-controlled province of Kosovo
were also planning to organize voting facilities there for the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the harassment of opposition activists continued. The
independent Beta news agency reported Saturday that seven members
of the popular anti-government group Otpor were beaten by the
police in the southern Serbian town of Vladicin Han on Friday after
putting up election posters.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of local opposition supporters chanted against the
authorities during the night, standing in front of the police
precinct where the students were held and demanding their release.
</P>
<P>
   The students were allowed to leave Saturday morning. They
received medical attention later but local doctors declined to sign
reports about their injuries that could be later used in the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the police also seized a transmitter used by a
local, opposition television station in the central Serbian town of
Cacak, in a further crackdown on media not controlled by
Milosevic's central government, Beta said.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Excites Fla. Congregation  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN FARRINGTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Children stared in awe at Joseph
Lieberman, and congregation members buzzed with excitement. One
person observed: ''There's more people here than there were at Rosh
Hashanah.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the Democrats' vice presidential nominee, sat in the
front row at Beth Israel Congregation on Saturday with a tallis, or
prayer shawl, over his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Private conversations were under way about whether more Jews are
Democrats or Republican, about the excitement of a Jew running on
the ticket with Vice President Al Gore. A few worshippers shushed
the others; one slapped the back of a wooden seat to bring quiet
during the service.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the congregation from the pulpit, Lieberman said his
candidacy reflects the diversity and tolerance of the United
States. He also confessed he still can't believe it when he is
introduced as a vice presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Neal Turk thanked Lieberman for bringing religion to the
forefront of the campaign rather than treating it as taboo and told
him he has made Jews proud.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the service, beaming congregation members approached
the Connecticut senator to shake his hand.
</P>
<P>
   By tradition, only men sat with Lieberman on the synagogue's
circular first floor. Hadassah Lieberman sat with the
congregation's women in the balcony, in the front row, facing her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   The Liebermans walked more than a mile to the synagogue from
their beach-front hotel, holding hands in the 90-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   Motorist slowed and honked horns. The Liebermans waved, gave
thumbs-up signs, and Lieberman pumped his fist in the air at one
driver. A group of cab drivers outside a hotel jumped up to greet
him.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rosenblatt, who normally worships at another synagogue,
came to Beth Israel and sat three rows behind the candidate. ''If
you have someone that's governing you that's human, that's real,
... you can have a lot more confidence,'' Rosenblatt said.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican, he said he's voting Gore-Lieberman.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe president charged with orchestrating terror in U.S. suit  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, went to a
Harlem church this week to say he would hand his black countrymen
justice - with the return of land stolen under colonialism.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as the 76-year-old African leader entered the Mount
Olivet Baptist Church, he was handed a lawsuit accusing him of
orchestrating political terror, including the beating and fatal
burning of an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed under the Alien Tort Claims Act, a
211-year-old U.S. law originally used against pirates. It allows
foreigners to file civil charges in the United States for alleged
crimes that violate international law.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, accused of atrocities in
his nation's civil war, was ordered to pay $745 million in damages
by a New York jury under the same law.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe was in New York for the United Nations Millennium Summit
of world leaders when he was served with the civil suit Thursday
charging him with human rights abuses surrounding Zimbabwe's
parliamentary elections in June.
</P>
<P>
   Filed in Manhattan federal court, the suit accuses him of
resorting to violence so his party, the Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriot Front (ZANU-PF), could stay in power. Human rights
groups have said that Mugabe supporters used brutal tactics against
the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).
</P>
<P>
   After leading his nation for 20 years, Mugabe is being pressured
to give up power for backing the takeovers of about 1,000
white-owned farms by black people - confrontations in which more
than 30 people were killed. He also faces accusations he looted his
nation's treasury to live in luxury.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking $400 million in damages, plaintiffs in the Manhattan
suit include relatives of people who were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the lawsuit were not available Saturday, but the
New York newspaper Newsday reported that the court complaint cites
the MDC's youth organizer, Tapfuma Chiminya Tachiona, who was
killed in April while campaigning. His widow, Adella Chiminya
Tachiona, allegedly was beaten unconscious with metal bars, boots
and fists by Mugabe's men, then doused with gasoline and set
ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks later, MDC candidate Matthew Pfebve was dragged
from his house during an attack by Mugabe supporters, then was
beaten and found naked and mutilated on a road, the court complaint
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another plaintiff, Evelyn Masaiti, also a MDC candidate, says
she was punched, burned by a gasoline bomb and had her house
torched, according to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   And Maria Del Carmen Stevens, the widow of farmer David Stevens,
charges her husband was kidnapped by ZANU-PF supporters, beaten,
forced to drink diesel oil and fatally shot.
</P>
<P>
   At the Harlem church, Mugabe insisted he does not seek revenge
against opponents. He noted that his nation's last white leader,
Ian Smith, was left to live. ''If I was a vengeful leader, would he
be walking the earth?'' Mugabe asked.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate is considering a bill that would cut off aid to
Zimbabwe, a southern African nation of about 11 million whose
government and ruling party - according to the legislation - are
guilty of ''deliberate and systematic violence, intimidation and
killings.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government has objected to the suit against Mugabe,
citing concerns that he might be entitled to immunity while on a
diplomatic visit. Federal Judge George Daniels then told the
plaintiffs that they had to find their own way to deliver the
papers to Mugabe, Newsday reported.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' attorney, Washington-based Theodore Cooperstein,
did not immediately respond to a message from The Associated Press
on Saturday seeking comment. A message left with the Zimbabwe's
embassy to the United States in Washington was not immediately
returned, and phone calls to the country's mission to the United
Nations went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   A Secret Service source in New York told the AP that the suit
was handed to the Zimbabwean president by a lawyer from a crowd of
people near the Harlem church, where Mugabe addressed about 4,000
people.

<HEADLINE> Women Activists Detained in Turkey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Police forced 35 Turkish and Kurdish
women activists onto buses Saturday, kicking and punching them, to
stop them from telling reporters about a message they had sent to
the U.N. secretary-general denouncing violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   The women had gathered in front of Istanbul's main post office
to send a postcard to Secretary-General Kofi Annan before police
rounded them up.
</P>
<P>
   ''We say no to war, we want peace. We say no to rape and
harassment in prisons,'' the postcard read.
</P>
<P>
   Several women were injured and one was treated at a hospital for
a broken arm, said Leman Yurtsever, one of the detained women.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration was organized by leftist political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want equal treatment for all women all around the world. We
are against violence, but today we are being beaten by police,''
said Yurtsever, speaking from a police bus.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey, a candidate to the European Union, has pledged to
improve its poor human rights record. The EU has urged Turkey to
find a peaceful solution to its 16-year war against Kurdish rebels
in the Kurdish-dominated southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, police detained 63 people in their weekly protest
against government plans to transfer prisoners from large prison
wards to small cells, the Anatolia news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates say they will be more vulnerable to abuse by prison
guards in the small cells. Human rights groups say torture is
common in prisons here.
</P>
<P>
   The government says it cannot control the large wards, where up
to 100 prisoners live crammed together in squalid conditions.
Inmates regularly stage riots, hostage-takings and hunger strikes.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
today as the United States signaled determination to salvage Middle East peace
talks despite a grim outlook. Neither side made much of the significance of
their midmorning get-together, at Barak's Central Park hotel in deference to his
observance of the Jewish Sabbath. Before the meeting, an Israeli official said
he expected no new ideas from Clinton on how to revitalize talks with the
Palestinians. After the session, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
characterized it as ''just kind of a friendly meeting.'' Nevertheless, White
House spokesman P.J. Crowley, in New York with Clinton for the United Nations'

   BOSTON (AP) -- Red Sox reliever Bryce Florie suffered serious eye damage and
underwent surgery today after being struck in the face by a line drive last
night. He has a severe injury to his right eyeball, but it was not ruptured and
his retina was damaged but not detached, Boston club physician Dr. Bill Morgan
said. The operation was done to release pressure on the eye and assess the
damage. In a statement released by the Red Sox, Morgan said, ''Prognosis for
reasonable vision is guarded.''

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Newspaper Reinstated  </HEADLINE>
By OMAR SHAMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- An Egyptian court ruled Saturday that an
opposition party suspended by the government could resume
publication of its newspaper, but did not rule on the ban on the
party's other activities.
</P>
<P>
   The court said the government's Political Parties Committee,
which suspended the Labor Party and its affiliated Al-Shaab
newspaper in May, does not have the authority to ban a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The court, however, said it did not have the jurisdiction to
rule on whether the suspension of the party itself was valid.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Shukri, the 83-year-old Labor Party leader, described
the court's decision as historic, saying it showed ''impartiality
in addressing democratic rights. ...This gives us a chance to at
least convey our opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Shukri played down the significance of the continuation of the
suspension on other party activities. Though Labor Party members
cannot run in upcoming parliamentary elections under the party
banner, they are competing as independents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Islamic party has only two seats in the 454-member
parliament, but its members frequently raise questions
uncomfortable for the government -- such as relations with Israel,
corruption and Islamic values -- in its newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The paper was suspended May 20, nearly two weeks after student
riots against a book denounced in an Al-Shaab article. The protests
left at least 40 students and six policemen injured.
</P>
<P>
   The article described as blasphemous a book by Syrian author
Haider Haider's novel ''Banquet of Seaweed'' that was republished
as part of a government literature promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors accused the newspaper of inciting violence by
allowing Muslim militants to write provocative articles that harmed
the country's ''unity and social peace.''

French Truckers Lifting Blockades
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French truckers began lifting nationwide blockades at oil
refineries and fuel depots Saturday after union leaders unanimously called for
an end to a six-day protest that has strangled fuel supplies, causing airport
delays and chaos at gas stations. With a majority of France's gas stations still
dry, however, the removal of blockades was not expected to ease immediately the
plight of motorists, who have had to line up bumper-to-bumper to fill their
tanks. The Interior Ministry said 30 oil refineries and fuel depots were still
blocked as of Saturday evening, compared with more than 100 earlier in the day.

their midmorning get-together, at Barak's Central Park hotel in deference to his
observance of the Jewish Sabbath. Before the meeting, an Israeli official said
he expected no new ideas from Clinton on how to revitalize talks with the
Palestinians. After the session, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright described

OPEC Nations Back Oil Boost

   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- As international pressure mounts on OPEC to pump more
oil to stem surging fuel prices, members of the petroleum producers' cartel said
Saturday they supported raising their official output by at least half a million
barrels a day. Oil ministers from Iran and Algeria said they would back an
increase of 500,000 barrels a day -- or 2 percent above OPEC's current
production -- when they meet with their counterparts at a crucial meeting
Sunday. Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali Naimi went further, suggesting that OPEC
would add ''at least'' that many fresh barrels to thirsty world markets.

   CHICAGO (AP) -- Poorly trained or overwhelmed nurses are responsible for

to a Chicago Tribune investigation. Since 1995, at least 1,720 hospital patients
have died and 9,548 others have been injured because of mistakes made by
registered nurses across the country, the Tribune found in an analysis of 3
million state and federal records. The records include cases of patients getting
overdoses of medication, vital care being delayed for hours and nurses

<HEADLINE> French Truckers Lifting Blockades  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French truckers began lifting nationwide blockades
at oil refineries and fuel depots Saturday after union leaders
unanimously called for an end to a six-day protest that has
strangled fuel supplies, causing airport delays and chaos at gas
stations.
</P>
<P>
   With a majority of France's gas stations still dry, however, the
removal of blockades was not expected to ease immediately the
plight of motorists, who have had to line up bumper-to-bumper to
fill their tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry said 30 oil refineries and fuel depots
were still blocked as of Saturday evening, compared with more than
100 earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   France's second-largest trucker group UNOSTRA was the last of
the three unions leading the protests to call an end to action,
asking members Saturday to remove blockades, saying union leaders
had accepted a government offer to cut fuel taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The administration of UNOSTRA, together with myself, decided
to lift our blockades,'' said union president Daniel Chevalier. He
added that regional union leaders would immediately begin work to
disperse rank and file members from blockades around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after the National Federation of Road
Transport, the country's largest trucker union, accepted the
government's deal late Friday. A third and smaller union had
accepted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The leftist government offered Wednesday to give truckers a
20-cent reimbursement per gallon of fuel this year, and a 14-cent
refund per gallon on gasoline taxes next year. Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin, under pressure from Green Party members of his
coalition, vowed that no further concessions would be made.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday, the protests have drawn international attention to
the difficulties truckers face as world fuel prices soar. They say
France's gasoline taxes -- the second-highest in the 15-member
European Union -- aggravate the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Many French motorists have sympathized with the plight of those
whose livelihood depends on gasoline. Diesel fuel in France costs
$2.84 per gallon, nearly twice the price of such fuel in the United
States. Fuel prices here have jumped about 40 percent in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, home of the EU's highest gas taxes, protesters
inspired by their French counterparts maintained scattered
blockades of refineries on Saturday, and consumers and suppliers
began to feel the pinch.
</P>
<P>
   The Shell oil company said 30 of its stations in the northwest
had run dry. Sainsbury's supermarket chain, which sells gasoline,
reported panic buying and a 30 percent increase in fuel sales.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters demanding a reduction in fuel taxes, had blockades
set up at five sites -- two in Wales, two in Bristol and one in
Cheshire.
</P>
<P>
   In France, the truckers had been joined in their protests by
farmers, ambulance drivers, taxi drivers and several other groups
that rely on fuel to do their job.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture unions urged members on Friday to end their
protests, saying they were satisfied with a government offer. Among
other things, the government offered farmers a 30 percent decrease
in gasoline taxesfor this year, said Luc Guyau, president of the
National Federation of Agricultural Workers, known as FNSEA.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, truckers and farmers in the Rhone region and in the
north near the Belgian border were among the first to clear
blockades at oil refineries and fuel depots. In the south,
blockades in the Alpes-Maritime region were also lifted.
</P>
<P>
   In the western Brittany region, however, hardline truckers
maintained protests at five depots. Militant truckers have clung to
demands for a higher tax-cut than the government offered.
</P>
<P>
   The protest was still being felt across France, with some
airports canceling flights because of lack of fuel.

<HEADLINE> 'Big Brother' Members Mull Walkout  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rebellion was afoot Saturday in the ''Big
Brother'' house.
</P>
<P>
   The reality show's six remaining contestants threatened to march
out of the camera-filled house in which they've been sequestered
since July, forgoing their shot at the $500,000 prize.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some things in life are more important than money,'' one
contestant said.
</P>
<P>
   The plot to walk out on Wednesday's upcoming live show, when the
next housemate was scheduled to be ousted, was made public on the
CBS show's companion Webcast on Saturday. Some players expressed
doubt that all would follow through on the pact.
</P>
<P>
   ''Big Brother'' was scheduled to end Sept. 30 with one grand
prize winner, the person who survived ouster votes by fellow
players and TV viewers. The show began with 10 contestants.
</P>
<P>
   CBS spokeswoman Diane Ekeblad suggested the players might have a
different motive.
</P>
<P>
   ''They think that they're all going to win money if they leave
together. ... They definitely would not,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The contestants' conversations broadcast live on the Internet,
however, didn't indicate they were expecting payment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm OK with walking away from this with nothing, just
memories,'' one player said.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme was suggested by contestant George, a 41-year-old
Illinois roofing contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The series, which airs six nights a week, was scheduled to see
either Eddie, Curtis or Cassandra -- the three players marked for
banishment -- voted out Wednesday. Other remaining players are Josh
and Jamie.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're watching it unfold as anybody on the Internet is
watching it unfold,'' Ekeblad said. CBS' response ''all depends on
what happens. There's no way to know what steps will be taken since
we don't know what they're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The rule always has been anybody is free to leave
voluntarily,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The revolt is yet another reason for CBS to regret ''Big
Brother'': The show, which critics blasted as cheap voyeurism, has
been far from the hit the network enjoyed with its other summer
reality series, the island competition ''Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   American reaction to ''Big Brother'' has been vastly different
than in Europe, where versions of the show proved hits in Holland,
Spain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to juice up the often-dull proceedings within the
house built on a CBS parking lot, the producers have tried
tinkering with the formula -- which has annoyed contestants and
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, an effort was made to lure a player out of the
house with a $50,000 incentive so a new contestant, an attractive,
opinionated young blonde, could be brought in. None of the six
would agree to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congratulations on your resolve,'' series host Julie Chen told
them in a disappointed voice.
</P>
<P>
   Some viewers are likely to cheer the players' revolt. Jeff
Oswald, a video technician from Charlotte, N.C., chipped in to send
a plane over the house last month with a banner message for
contestants: '' 'Big Brother' is worse than you think. Get out
now.''
</P>
<P>
   To Oswald, the show is cruel as well as boring. He believes the
producers are playing mind games with participants in a stressful
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a lot like when you go to a zoo,'' he said last month.
''If the monkeys aren't doing anything, you poke them with a
stick.''

<HEADLINE> Colombia Passenger Plane Hijacked  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Airline passenger Jose Orlando Ossa
didn't find it suspicious when a man on his domestic flight over
the Andes got up and went to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, apparently, did the three federal prison guards who
were supposed to be watching the man -- a suspected rebel serving
time for a policeman's death. Not until he emerged from the
lavatory waving a handgun and headed for the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said it was a hijacking, that it was to obtain his freedom
and that he was a guerrilla,'' Ossa told reporters late Friday,
after the plane's harrowing diversion into rebel-held southern
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Ossa was among 22 passengers and crew aboard the Aires airlines
Dash 8 turboprop, hijacked during a flight from Bogota to the
southwestern provincial capital of Florencia.
</P>
<P>
   All were freed unharmed after the plane touched down on a
guerrilla-held southern airstrip, dropped off the hijacker, then
landed safely in the southwestern city of Neiva. No other demands
were made.
</P>
<P>
   But the in-flight hijacking -- the second this year by a prisoner
being escorted by federal guards -- could have repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   Besides embarrassing the country's scandal-plagued penitentiary
system, it could rattle fledgling peace talks to end Colombia's
36-year guerrilla conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the hijacker, Arnobio Ramos, was a member of the
country's largest leftist insurgent group, the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   Ossa also said the hijacker identified himself as a member of a
FARC faction based in southern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels denied Ramos was a guerrilla, though they did
acknowledge the plane landed on a FARC-controlled airstrip in the
southern town of San Vicente del Caguan.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a common criminal,'' FARC spokesman Andres Paris told
Colombia's RCN television. ''This is not a guerrilla action. This
is not a FARC action.''
</P>
<P>
   Paris said the rebels had apprehended the hijacker, but gave no
clear indication whether the group planned to turn him over to
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   San Vicente del Caguan is located in a region the government
ceded to the FARC as part of the negotiations. The territory, about
twice the size of New Jersey, is off-limits for soldiers and
police. Officials say it has become a haven for drug traffickers
and kidnappers under the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   Public skepticism about the FARC's sincerity in the negotiations
is running high.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's was Colombia's third high-profile hijacking in the last
18 months, the second involving guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a convicted murderer being transported to a prison
commandeered a plane at knifepoint. He forced the plane, with 17
people aboard, to land in a northern region rife with right-wing
paramilitary squads. He was killed hours later by the militias.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, members of the country's second-largest rebel
faction, the National Liberation Army, hijacked an Avianca domestic
flight with 41 passengers and crew on board. The group still holds
several passengers hostage, seeking ransom and peace concessions
from the government.

<HEADLINE> Calif. To Expand Scholarsip Program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis is expected to sign a
bill on Monday that will create the nation's largest state
scholarship program, covering college tuition for an estimated
100,000 California high school graduates each year.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time in California, every student at every high
school who works hard to maintain grades high enough to obtain
admission to college or university, but needs a financial boost,
will be guaranteed financial aid to pursue an advanced degree,''
the democratic governor said it touting the plan.
</P>
<P>
   High school graduates with at least a ''C'' average and
financial need will be eligible for either full tuition at one of
the state's public universities or up to $9,700 annually to attend
a private college under the program.
</P>
<P>
   The only requirements: Recipients must maintain a full class
load and remain in ''good academic standing,'' typically meaning a
''C'' average or better. No repayment is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 billion program will dramatically expand the state's
existing scholarship program, known as Cal Grants. According to the
Governor's Finance Department, which writes the state's budgets, it
will create the largest state scholarship program in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''California is putting its cards on the table. It's making this
an entitlement. That's gutsy,'' Travis Reindl, a policy analyst for
the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, said
in Saturday's Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, some 133,000 eligible students applied for Cal Grant
aid for the first time, but three out of five were passed over when
the money ran out. Davis' office said the expanded program likely
will cost about $1.2 billion annually after it fully takes effect
in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Money for the expanded program is coming from a $12 billion
budget surplus, the state's largest surplus ever.
</P>
<P>
   To be eligible, students with family incomes of $33,700 or less
for a family of four will have to have at least a 2.0 grade-point
average. Those with a family income up to $64,100 for a family of
four and at least a 3.0 grade-point average will also be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   ''This historic agreement sends a message to all students: If
you do your part to succeed, we'll do our part to make every
opportunity available,'' Davis said.

<HEADLINE> Former Head of Mexico Party Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Carlos Castillo Peraza, a former president of the
party brought to power in Mexico this year in historic presidential
elections, died Saturday during a trip to Germany, the Mexican
Embassy said. He was 53.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo died of a heart attack in Bonn, the former capital,
embassy spokesman Lino Santa Cruz Moctezuma said. He said he had no
further details. Mexico's Notimex news agency reported that
Castillo was on a business trip.
</P>
<P>
   President-elect Vicente Fox, a member of the National Action
Party, described Castillo as ''a great companion from whom I
learned a lot.'' Fox won July presidential elections, ending 71
years of rule in Mexico by the Institutional Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo was president of National Action from 1993-1996. He
served twice as a deputy in Mexico's lower house of Congress --
first in 1979-82, then in 1988-91. He also ran for mayor of Mexico
City in 1997, losing to Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Democratic
Revolution Party.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to serving as a political adviser to his National
Action Party, he taught political philosophy at La Salle University
in Mexico City and wrote for several Mexican newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   He was known for his acerbic wit, which sometimes got him into
trouble -- especially when he was running for office.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo was born in Merida, Mexico, on April 17, 1947. He
earned a philosophy and literature degree from Mexico's National
Autonomous University, then attended graduate school at the
University of Fribourg, Switzerland, specializing in political
philosophy.
</P>

   No funeral plans were immediately announced.

the money ran out. Davis' office said the expanded program likely
will cost about $1.2 billion annually after it fully takes effect
in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Money for the expanded program is coming from a $12 billion
budget surplus, the state's largest surplus ever.
</P>
<P>
   To be eligible, students with family incomes of $33,700 or less
for a family of four will have to have at least a 2.0 grade-point
average. Those with a family income up to $64,100 for a family of
four and at least a 3.0 grade-point average will also be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   ''This historic agreement sends a message to all students: If
you do your part to succeed, we'll do our part to make every
opportunity available,'' Davis said.

<HEADLINE> Tough Day for Politics in Nebraska  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY BEDLAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRBURY, Neb. (AP) -- Tom Osborne the congressional candidate
walked quickly toward the side of the street where a parade watcher
pressed a hand radio against his ear.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's the score?'' Osborne yelled Saturday as he paused from
waving at the dozens of onlookers sitting on lawn chairs along the
parade route.
</P>
<P>
   ''Its still zero-zero in the first quarter,'' the man shouted,
barely pulling the radio away from his ear to respond to the famed
former Nebraska football coach.
</P>
<P>
   As the top-ranked Cornhuskers played one of the biggest games of
their season against No. 23 Notre Dame, Osborne was courting voters
in Nebraska's 3rd District House race.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough day to be a political candidate in Nebraska --
especially for Osborne. As he tried to focus on handshakes and
waves, Nebraska was winning 27-24 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Before the kickoff and the start of the city's annual Germanfest
parade 30 minutes later, Osborne walked into a restaurant where
about 100 people had gathered around television sets to watch the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne was greeted with applause, camera flashes and the
outstretched pens of fans asking the coach who led the Huskers to
three national titles in the 1990s to sign footballs, books,
T-shirts, even napkins.
</P>
<P>
   But when the game started, their interest immediately turned to
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Even Osborne abruptly stopped a conversation with a woman
requesting an autograph and stared at a big screen TV as Notre Dame
returned the opening kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Few people noticed when Osborne left minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate to miss the game,'' he said from the parade. ''But
people keep hollering the scores at me when I am not around a radio
or TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne, a Republican who is challenging real-estate developer
Rollie Reynolds for the seat left by retiring GOP Rep. Bill Barrett
in an overwhelmingly Republican district, planned to catch the
second half of the game on his car radio as he drove to another
campaign appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone was worried that not many people would show up and
instead stay at home to watch the game on TV,'' said Shana
Rickstrew of Diller, who donned a Cornhusker T-shirt during the
parade ''But I think more people came out because Tom Osborne was
here.''
</P>
<P>
   They came out, but well equipped: Many spectators as well as
parade participants carried radios or wore radio head sets or never
left their cars where the radios were tuned to the game.

Clinton Meets With Barak After Summit
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- President Clinton met today with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak to see if the Middle East peace negotiations could be
salvaged, as more than 150 world leaders headed home from the historic U.N.
Millennium Summit. Most of the top-level dignitaries left New York, armed with a
challenge by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to use their power to give billions of
people a better life in the 21st century. But a few leaders, like Barak and
Clinton, kept up the diplomatic whirl, which included a meeting Saturday between
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Pakistan leader Pervez Musharraf at the
Waldorf-Astoria hotel.

French Truckers Rid Blockades
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French truckers began eliminating nationwide blockades at oil
refineries and fuel depots Saturday once union leaders unanimously ended a
six-day protest that caused havoc at airports and gas stations. With most of
France's gas stations still dry, however, the removal of blockades was not
expected to ease immediately the struggle faced by motorists who've been waiting
in line to fill their tanks. The Interior Ministry said 30 oil refineries and
fuel depots were still blocked as of Saturday evening, compared with more than
100 earlier in the day.

   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- As pressure mounts on OPEC to pump more oil to stem

they backed raising their official output by at least half a million barrels a
day. Oil ministers from Iran and Algeria said they would support an increase of
500,000 barrels a day -- or 2 percent above OPEC's current production -- when
they meet with their counterparts at a crucial meeting Sunday.

Indonesia Rules Out Pact Extension

   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The Indonesian government has ruled out extending

December, news reports said Saturday. Defense Minister Mahfud M.D. accused
rebels of using the cease-fire, officially known as a humanitarian pause, to
stockpile thousands of weapons and strengthen its forces. The Free Aceh Movement
is a separatist group that has been fighting for 25 years for an independent
Islamic state in the province, located on the northern tip of Indonesia's
Sumatra island.

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis is expected to sign a bill on

college tuition for an estimated 100,000 California high school graduates each

will be eligible for either full tuition at one of the state's public
universities or up to $9,700 annually to attend a private college under the

Iranian Film Wins Top Venice Prize
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VENICE, Italy (AP) -- An Iranian film about the tough life women face in that
Islamic state took the top prize in the Venice Film Festival on Saturday. ''The
Circle'' (''Dayereh''), which won the Golden Lion award, was a popular favorite
after it was screened at the festival, which began on Aug. 30. It is 40-year-old
director Jafar Panahi's third feature film. His 1995 ''The White Balloon''
(''Badkonake sefid'') and 1997 ''The Mirror'' (''Ayneh'') have won several
international awards. ''The Circle'' tells the story of eight Iranian women
struggling with the restrictions their society places on them because they are
women. The opening scene shows a woman giving birth to a child unwanted because
she is female.

hook in the first set of their semifinal and watched the all-time Grand Slam
record-holder take advantage of it in a 7-6 (7), 6-4, 7-6 (5) victory. That put
No. 4 Sampras in Sunday's Open championship against No. 6 Marat Safin, who
methodically broke down Todd Martin's game, taking it apart one piece at a time
with lobs, drops and passing shots in a 6-3, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (1) victory. After
Sampras and Safin advanced, rain delayed the start of the women's championship

   CHICAGO (AP) -- Richard Hidalgo, Lance Berkman and Tim Bogar each hit two
homers, part of a team-record seven today that powered the Houston Astros to a
14-4 victory over the Chicago Cubs. Bogar drove in a career-high five runs and
Daryle Ward added a solo shot for the Astros, who lead the NL with 220 home
runs. Houston had posted four six-homer games this year. It was only the fifth
time in Cubs history they have served up seven in a game, and first since July
12, 1996, against St. Louis.

<HEADLINE> Investment Scammer Gets 27 Years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARTOW, Fla. (AP) -- A man who used a phony oil exploration
company to bilk investors of an estimated $20 million in the 1980s
was sentenced to 27 years in prison for violating probation.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen L. Smith, 49, pleaded guilty in 1989 to operating a
pyramid scheme that focused on the elderly and involved 700
investors. He served four years in federal prison and started a
10-year probation term in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested again last September in Pensacola and was found
guilty of violating conditions of his probation that barred him
from running businesses, holding corporate bank accounts and
working for companies that handled finances and business
consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing for a lesser sentence, co-counsel Robert Norgard said
Smith had abided by stringent probation conditions before being
charged with ''technical violations.''
</P>
<P>
   The maximum 27-year sentence imposed Friday may be reduced if
Smith is able to pay an additional $5.5 million in restitution to
scam victims, said Assistant State Attorney Wayne Durden. About $15
million was recovered through the sale of his assets.

<HEADLINE> Plane Lands on Colo. Boulevard  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A pilot flying a vintage plane to an air show made
an emergency landing on a suburban boulevard Saturday after the
plane's engine stopped. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   John Zayac, 41, of Englewood, said the plane developed engine
troubles over the west side of the city after he took off from
Centennial Airport in suburban Arapahoe County en route to the
National Championship Air Races in Reno, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   He turned back, following a major highway to stay away from
residential areas. Then the engine went dead.
</P>
<P>
   The highway Zayac was following had heavy traffic, but he saw
that four-lane Colorado Boulevard south of Denver was mostly clear,
so he maneuvered to avoid a pickup truck and landed on the
boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was more lucky than good,'' Zayac said.
</P>
<P>
   He later took off on the same street and headed for a nearby
airport after the plane's engine was repaired. He was flying a
North American SNJ5, which was used as an advanced trainer by the
U.S. Navy.

<HEADLINE> Probe: Nursing Mistakes Cause Deaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Poorly trained or overwhelmed nurses are
responsible for thousands of deaths and injuries each year in the
nation's hospitals, according to a Chicago Tribune investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, at least 1,720 hospital patients have died and 9,548
others have been injured because of mistakes made by registered
nurses across the country, the Tribune found in an analysis of 3
million state and federal records. The analysis is published in the
Tribune's Sunday editions.
</P>
<P>
   The records include cases of patients getting overdoses of
medication, vital care being delayed for hours and nurses
performing medical procedures without proper training.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune report, which focused on nursing mistakes, follows
claims made in a wider-reaching 1999 report by the Institute of
Medicine that estimated medical mistakes kill anywhere from 44,000
to 98,000 hospitalized Americans each year.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune's analysis found that many hospitals have
increasingly turned to part-time nurses from temporary agencies. It
also found that at least 119 patients had died under the care of
unlicensed, unregulated nurses aides, who earn an average $9 an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Mandatory overtime and 16-hour shifts have led to a shortage of
nurses willing to work at the University of Illinois at Chicago
Medical Center, said registered nurse Kathy Cloninger, who has
worked there for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wake up every day and hope I don't kill someone today,''
Cloninger told the Tribune. ''Every day I pray: God protect me. Let
me make it out of there with my patients alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Nursing staffs have been the first target for cutbacks at
hospitals where profits have been squeezed by managed care programs
and falling federal Medicaid reimbursements, said Rick Wade of the
American Hospital Association.
</P>
<P>
   Under a cost-saving program in at least two Chicago hospitals,
housekeeping staff assigned to clean rooms were pressed into duty
as aides to dispense medicine, the Tribune found.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony prepared for a national meeting scheduled Monday in
Washington to discuss medical errors, the American Nurses
Association said there is a critical need for research to explore
the relationship of staffing levels and the number of medical
errors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first hospital injury lawsuits to target
corporate-level staffing decisions rather than individual
negligence involved 61-year-old Shirley Keck, whose pleas for help
went unnoticed as she lay gasping for breath at Wesley Medical
Center in Wichita, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Keck was one of 41 critically ill patients on her floor in
February 1988 when she started having trouble breathing. Her
daughter, Becky Hartman, ran to a nurses station several times for
help but couldn't find help.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was nobody around,'' Hartman said. ''I was raising my
voice and getting angry. I was so frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Her lawsuit alleged that lack of monitoring by nurses -- caused
by short staffing -- led directly to the permanent brain damage Keck
suffered. The hospital agreed to a $2.7 million out-of-court
settlement, but maintains that it was safely staffed.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine report, issued in November, attributed
many hospital deaths to basic flaws in the way hospitals, clinics
and pharmacies operate. It was criticized by Indiana University
scientists who said that the numbers were exaggerated and that the
report failed to eliminate other risks or possible causes for the
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1999 report came out, President Clinton said hospitals
should agree to routine reporting of serious and deadly mistakes.

<HEADLINE> Striking MoMA workers reach tentative settlement with museum  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The Museum of Modern Art and the union that
represents more than 100 staffers on strike since April reached an
agreement early Saturday, according to the museum and the union
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very pleased. We absolutely won on every issue,'' said
Maida Rosenstein, president of the Professional and Administrative
Staff Association - Local 2110 of the United Auto Workers union.
</P>
<P>
   The first strike in 27 years by museum employees - including
archivists, conservators, curators, librarians and other
professionals - forced visitors to pass picket lines, with strikers
at times chanting and blowing whistles.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 a.m. Saturday, the two sides finally reached a deal on a
new contract that will last until the completion in about five
years of the museum's planned $650 million expansion on West 53rd
Street.
</P>
<P>
   The contract was ratified later Saturday by members of Local
2110, which represents 250 of the museum's 630 employees; only
about half actively joined the strike.
</P>
<P>
   The union, one of several representing museum employees, was
fighting what they said were unfair salaries starting at $17,000
for a sales clerk or visitor assistant, with median wages of
$29,000. Another major sticking point was job security during
construction; MoMA had planned for staff reductions.
</P>
<P>
   The old contract expired Oct. 31 and workers in the union went
on strike in April.
</P>
<P>
   The truce reached Saturday provides for an average annual
increase of 3.5 percent, with the contract expiring in five years,
or six months after the new museum opens - whichever is longer,
Rosenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, staffers are guaranteed the right to return
to their jobs after the work is done. Or, a staff member with more
than two years service may choose a severance package of two weeks'
pay for each year of work.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, union negotiators confirmed the status quo on
health benefits, plus an improved dental plan; the museum had
wanted to waive workers' right to bargain over the benefits,
Rosenstein said. Retirement benefits also are better, with employee
contributions matched with various amounts depending on salary and
number of work years.
</P>
<P>
   Staffers also will receive child-care subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   And, the Local 2110 president said, the lowest-paid employees
with many years of experience are to receive seniority-based
increases in addition to the standard raises.
</P>
<P>
   MoMA director Glenn Lowry said that he and the museum's board of
trustees ''believe the contract is fair, balances the needs of our
employees with the museum's budgetary reality, and allows MoMA to
move forward with its entire staff to launch the rich program of
exhibitions and events planned for the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Through Jan. 26, MoMA is exhibiting some of the most-loved
paintings and sculptures from its collection, including such icons
of modern art as Van Gogh's ''Starry Night'' and Picasso's
''Demoiselles D'Avignon.'' Opening Nov. 22 is ''Projects 69,'' New
York artist Julia Jacquette's series of paintings about romance and
desire, with all-American food juxtaposed against erotic images.
</P>
<P>
   MoMA, one of the world's most prestigious art museums, is to
close sometime next year to start the expansion project. During
that time, its major exhibitions will be held in the former
Swingline factory in the Long Island City section of Queens and the
nearby P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center, a converted schoolhouse.

<HEADLINE> Boy May Have Used Web To Buy Car  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. (AP) -- A 15-year-old unlicensed driver who
crashed through a fence and ran over a stop sign may have bought
the car by tapping a state account through the Internet, police
say.
</P>
<P>
   Terrance Lloyd bought the $15,000 Plymouth Neon last month from
a Chrysler dealer, negotiating the deal through e-mail and
telephone calls, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show the boy paid for the car using CheckFree, a
service that allows customers to send checks electronically. The
account the check was drawn on belongs to the State of Florida
Disbursement Unit, which issues child support payments.
</P>

Clinton, Barak Meet After Summit
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- President Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak met today to see if the Middle East peace negotiations could be salvaged,
as more than 150 world leaders headed home from the U.N. Millennium Summit. Most
of the top-level dignitaries left New York, armed with a challenge by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to use their power to give billions of people a
better life in the 21st century. But a few leaders, like Barak and Clinton, kept
up the diplomatic whirl, which included a meeting today between Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and Pakistan leader Pervez Musharraf at the
Waldorf-Astoria hotel.

OPEC Nations Back Oil Increase

<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- As pressure mounts on OPEC to pump more oil to stem
surging fuel prices, members of the petroleum producers' cartel said Saturday
they backed raising their official output by at least half a million barrels a
day. Oil ministers from Iran and Algeria said they would support an increase of
500,000 barrels a day -- or 2 percent above OPEC's current production -- when
they meet with their counterparts at a crucial meeting Sunday.

French Truckers Lifting Blockades

   PARIS (AP) -- French truckers began eliminating nationwide blockades at oil
refineries and fuel depots Saturday once union leaders unanimously ended a
six-day protest that caused havoc at airports and gas stations. With most of
France's gas stations still dry, however, the removal of blockades was not
expected to ease immediately the struggle faced by motorists who've been waiting
in line to fill their tanks. The Interior Ministry said 30 oil refineries and
fuel depots were still blocked as of Saturday evening, compared with more than
100 earlier in the day.

Women Activists Detained in Turkey

   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Police forced 35 Turkish and Kurdish women activists
onto buses Saturday, kicking and punching them, to stop them from telling
reporters about a message they had sent to the U.N. secretary-general denouncing
violence against women. The women had gathered in front of Istanbul's main post
office to send a postcard to Secretary-General Kofi Annan before police rounded
them up. ''We say no to war, we want peace. We say no to rape and harassment in
prisons,'' the postcard read. Several women were injured and one was treated at
a hospital for a broken arm, said Leman Yurtsever, one of the detained women.
The demonstration was organized by leftist political parties.

Northwest Joins in Fare Hike

   EAGAN, Minn. (AP) -- Northwest Airlines said today it has joined the nation's
other major airlines in raising domestic fares, adding a surcharge of $20 per
round trip to cover the higher cost of jet fuel. No. 5 Continental Airlines
posted the higher fares Thursday, and by Friday, TWA and the nation's three
largest carriers -- United, American and Delta -- said they would match the
increase. Northwest, the No. 4 carrier, increased fares at least twice earlier
this year. The Minnesota-based carrier boosted fares in January and again in
March, saying the increases were related to rising fuel costs.

<HEADLINE> Aussies Urge Racial Harmony  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Activists planted symbolic hands in a
park here Saturday to urge reconciliation between black and white
Australians, an early protest in a series of demonstrations on the
plight of Aborigines planned for Sydney's Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters said a ''mean-spirited'' federal government is
blocking racial harmony between Australia's earliest inhabitants
and the whites who followed in recent centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Activists placed tens of thousands of colorful plastic cutouts
in the shape of hands on the grounds of Sydney's Centennial Park,
where road cycling events are due to be held during the Sept.
15-Oct. 1 games.
</P>
<P>
   The hand symbol adopted for the demonstration originates with
the Aborigines. For tens of thousands of years, the indigenous
people marked their presence in Australia by pressing smeared hands
against the rock walls of caves.
</P>
<P>
   Street demonstrations are expected during the games, including
plans for a human chain formed by placard-holding activists near
the airport where most visitors and athletes will arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Some 260,000 people signed hand cutouts for the two-day ''Sea of
Hands'' protest, which aims to point out the failures of
conservative Prime Minister John Howard's government on
reconciliation and other Aboriginal issues, said organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a mean-spirited prime minister and government in this
country who can't find it in their hearts to say sorry, to accept
the history of this country,'' said Lowitja O'Donohue, an
Aboriginal elder who heads a committee advising the games
organizers on indigenous issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''This sets back the process of reconciliation and sets back the
healing of this country. This country needs healing,'' said
O'Donohue, who is head of the committee that advises the Sydney
games organizers on indigenous issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea of Hands was organized by Australians for
Reconciliation, a group made up of Aborigines and white Australians
</P>
<P>
   Aborigines have lived in Australia for as many as 40,000 years.
After 212 years of white settlement, they are now a minority of
around 380,000 in a population of 19 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Indigenous people are Australia's poorest, least healthy and
most jailed section of society. Their life expectancy is an average
of 20 years less than that of white Australians.
</P>
<P>
   Howard has incensed Aborigines and many white Australians with
his refusal to deliver a formal government apology for past
mistreatment of indigenous people and for policies that have been
criticized as discriminatory by U.N. human rights committees.

<HEADLINE> Haider Chides Leaders on Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Far-right politician Joerg Haider claimed
political victory over the leaders of France and Germany in
comments published Saturday, after a European Union panel
recommended lifting sanctions against Austria that the two leaders
had supported.
</P>
<P>
   France's Foreign Ministry said Saturday it had begun consulting
with its EU partners over the panel report on the sanctions, which
were slapped on Austria after Haider's Freedom Party -- criticized
for its anti-immigrant stance -- was brought into the country's
ruling coalition in October.
</P>
<P>
   Haider said the report by the EU's so-called ''three wise men''
vindicated his party and Austria's present government and
represented ''a Waterloo'' for French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   ''Napoleons always end in Waterloo,'' Haider said in the
interview in an upcoming issue of Austria's Format magazine,
excerpts of which were carried Saturday by the Austria Press
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Haider also said German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder ''played a
very regrettable role,'' in leveling the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''He believed that when he dirtied Austria's name, he could
distract attention from Germany's historical burden,'' Haider said.
''That shows what sort of personality we are dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Chirac, whom Haider once ridiculed as a ''pocket-sized
Napoleon,'' has been one of Austria's most vocal critics.
</P>
<P>
   Haider has made statements supportive of some aspects of the
Nazi regime, but has denied pro-Nazi leanings. He has on a number
of occasions offered apologies for the remarks. He stepped down as
head of the Freedom Party, trying to reduce outrage over its
presence in the government.
</P>
<P>
   The EU experts' report concluded that Austria was ''respectful
of common European values'' and that diplomatic sanctions against
Austria had become counterproductive and ought to be eliminated. It
also said the sanctions had strengthened nationalism in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Under the sanctions, Austria's EU partners broke off bilateral
political contacts, snubbed Austrian ministers attending routine EU
meetings and boycotted school trips, cultural exchanges and
military exercises.
</P>
<P>
   The three experts, former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari,
former Spanish Foreign Minister Marcelino Oreja and German law
expert Juergen Frowein turned their report over to Chirac, whose
country holds the rotating six-month EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
   French presidential spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna, said France
would study the report and make any decisions in consultation with
the other 13 EU members that applied sanctions Jan. 31.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Airman in Japan Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A U.S. airman stationed in Japan turned himself in
to police Saturday after an early morning hit-and-run incident that
killed a 72-year-old Japanese woman, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Tachikawa, a western suburb of Tokyo, identified the
airman as Jon M. Mills, a 24-year-old enlisted man stationed at
Yokota Air Base. They did not know his hometown or specify his
rank.
</P>
<P>
   After questioning Mills, police arrested him on charges of
professional negligence resulting in death.
</P>
<P>
   Mills is suspected of hitting 72-year-old retiree Chiyoko
Nakamura while driving through Tachikawa back to the base at about
2:30 a.m. Saturday, then fleeing the scene, said Katsuhiko Seki,
duty officer at the Tachikawa Police Station.
</P>
<P>
   The woman died shortly afterward of injuries to the head.
</P>
<P>
   Mills turned himself in less than two hours later and admitted
responsibility for the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Yokota Air Base, located in Tokyo's western
suburbs, could not be reached for comment.

<HEADLINE> Belgian royals land in NYC, are greeted in Belgian style  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)- The prince and princess of Belgium landed in New
York Saturday, and were immediately whisked to a hip downtown
eatery where they were feted in grand Belgian style.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 300 Belgian nationals gathered at Markt, a
cavernous Belgian restaurant, to greet Belgium's crown prince
Phillippe and princess Mathilde, sipping fine Belgian ales and
tossing around innumerable air-kisses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let us drink to Belgium, particularly with our most honored
representatives with us,'' said Baron Paul De Keersmaeker, chairman
of Belgian brewer Interbrew.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, which was made up of well-to-do Belgian expatriates,
models, and various members of the royal family, applauded as the
royal pair exited their motorcade amid a crush of foreign press.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really wonderful to be living here, and still be able to
meet them,'' said Belgian-born model Annesophie Balsing.
</P>
<P>
   The crown prince and princess are scheduled to embark upon a
five-day, 17-event royal tour of New York to tout all things
Belgian.
</P>
<P>
   That means traveling with an entourage of Belgium's movers and
shakers, including the prime minister, foreign trade officials and
the chairmen of some of the nation's biggest companies.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, Belgium's future king wields power with real
political teeth: The constitutional monarchy appoints each new
government, uniting a linguistic patchwork of Dutch and
French-speakers often at each other's ethnic throats.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the recent health problems of Belgium's 66-year-old
King Albert II, have started tongues wagging that he might yield
the throne to his son.
</P>
<P>
   The pair are scheduled to ring the opening bell of the New York
Stock Exchange on Monday, followed by a series of addresses at the
Fashion Institute of Technology, the Metropolitan Club and the
University Club throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Princess, who has been dubbed by some as the
''Queens of Hearts,'' will also visit a South Bronx halfway house
run by a Belgian nun who is a chaplain at Rikers Island jail.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay's Eric Quill scored two goals as
the Mutiny and Kansas City Wizards played to a 2-2 tie Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's Mamadou Diallo was held without a goal and finished
the regular season with a league leading 26. Diallo was robbed
twice from point-blank range by goalkeeper Tony Meola.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was one short of Roy Lassiter's MLS record of 27 set in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Henderson and Miklos Molnar, who tied it in the 66th
minute, scored for the Wizards. Kansas City had beaten Tampa Bay
four straight times.
</P>
<P>
   Quill, who departed late in the second half with a right ankle
injury, put the Mutiny ahead 1-0 in the 8th minute. He redirected a
pass from Diallo from near the right post. Quill's second of the
game, and fifth this season came, on a give-and-go with Carlos
Valderrama in the 33rd minute.
</P>
<P>
   The assist extended Valderrama's MLS-record single-season total
to 26.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards played without three injured starters: Preki (right
hamstring strain), Mo Johnston (right knee strain) and Chris Klein
(left hamstring strain).

<HEADLINE> No. 8 Florida 55, Middle Tennessee 0  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Backup Rex Grossman threw three
touchdown passes to spark another Florida quarterback controversy
as the eighth-ranked Gators beat Middle Tennessee 55-0 Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The redshirt freshman replaced Jesse Palmer in the middle of a
series with his team leading 24-0, but coach Steve Spurrier
apparently unhappy with the way his starter was throwing and moving
the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman threw TD passes of 19 and 14 yards to Aaron Walker, as
well as a 16-yarder to Alex Willis that finished a seven-play,
50-yard drive that Palmer began with a 13-yard completion to Reche
Caldwell.
</P>
<P>
   Florida (2-0) also scored on Earnest Graham's 4-yard run, which
capped a 96-yard drive Palmer directed in the first quarter. Lito
Sheppard returned a punt 54 yards for a touchdown, and Todd Johnson
scooped up a fumble and ran 76 yards for a fourth-quarter score.
</P>
<P>
   Middle Tennessee (0-2) never threatened, finishing with 229
yards and five turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite amassing 495 yards total offense in its season opener,
Spurrier was not happy with Florida's sloppy play in 21-point
victory over Ball State. Palmer led touchdown drives on the Gators'
first two possessions this time, but struggled to hit open
receivers as the night progressed.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman threw his TD pass to Willis, after replacing Palmer
with four minutes left in the second quarter. He threw the first of
his two scoring passes to Walker after a Middle Tennessee fumble,
giving Florida a 38-0 lead at the break.
</P>
<P>
   When the teams returned to the field for the second half, Palmer
sat on a bench behind most of his teammates while Grossman and true
freshman Brock Berlin warmed up to play the remainder of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer completed 15 of 23 passes for 193 yards and one
touchdown, a 17-yard throw to Taylor Jacobs on the sixth play of
the game. Grossman was 9-for-14 for 95 yards and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   Middle Tennessee is working through a quarterback dilemma of its
own, with Wes Counts and Jason Johnson once again splitting playing
time. Neither had much success against the Florida defense, which
recovered three fumbles and didn't allow the Blue Raiders to get
anywhere close to scoring range.
</P>
<P>
   Counts completed 7 of 16 passes for 58 yards, while Johnson was
10-for-16 for 81 yards and one interception.

<HEADLINE> Fox: Mexico's PRI Will Stay Atop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The Institutional Revolutionary Party will
remain a political force in Mexico, despite losing the presidency
July 2 after 71 years of rule, the party's president said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   During a national forum, titled ''A party discussion: 'What to
do?' Dulce Maria Sauri demanded that the party, known as the PRI,
retain a place in the country's politics because it was the author
of Mexico's democracy, Mexico's government news agency Notimex
reported.
</P>
<P>
   On July 2, Vicente Fox became the first opposition presidential
candidate to defeat a member of the PRI, which has ruled Mexico
since its creation in 1929. The loss left the party in shambles,
with several groups within the PRI fighting for power.
</P>
<P>
   Sauri said the PRI was prepared to monitor the incoming
government. Fox will be sworn in as president on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not leaving, not disappearing,'' Sauri said. ''We are a
political force that knows how to change and participate with
respect to society and politics and democracy in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Sauri stressed that the PRI should continue to debate the
country's problems, as well as its own direction.
</P>
<P>
   Sauri's comments coincided with Fox's announcement Saturday that
he planned to trim Mexico's federal government to make it more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with his transition team, Fox said he planned to
organize his government to better respond to the needs of the
Mexican people, Mexico's official news agency reported. He also
said his government would look for ways to cut costs and eliminate
programs and projects that are no longer priorities.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added that he would not begin firing government
workers to cut expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Fox leaves Sunday for a four-day trip to five Central American
countries, starting with Guatemala.

<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- A Saudi man convicted of rape and a
Nigerian convicted of smuggling cocaine were beheaded Saturday, the
Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Farhan Abdullah Radi was executed in the capital Riyadh for
kidnapping a woman off the street and raping her in a remote area,
the Interior Ministry statement said. Radi, it said, also was
convicted of other rape attempts and of trying to impersonate a
police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian Tawfiq Tasin Mohammed was executed in the Red Sea port
city of Jiddah for smuggling cocaine, the statement said. It gave
no other details.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's executions bring to at least 96 the number of people
beheaded in the kingdom this year. At least 99 people were executed
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Executions are carried out with a sword in a public square.
Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islamic law, which
prescribes death sentences for murder, rape, drug trafficking and
armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   The executions have been criticized by human rights
organizations, which say Saudi Arabia often fails to give the
accused fair trials and point out that Islam calls for limiting the
use of execution as punishment.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUNKER, Mo. (AP) -- A three-day search for a man accused of
opening fire on city workers and killing two men ended Saturday
when a landowner near the Mark Twain National Forest found the
suspect's body.
</P>
<P>
   Officials haven't released how Garry Dewayne Watson died, said
Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Marty Elmore. Results of an
autopsy weren't expected until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Police had been searching the national forest since Thursday,
when they say Watson began shooting at city workers who crossed his
property in the Ozark town of Bunker to reach a sewage lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the town of 300 about 100 miles southwest of St.
Louis said Watson, 49, had been feuding with the city for years
over an easement on the one-acre lot where he lived in a mobile
home.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, when the city workers arrived to work on the
lagoon, Watson began firing, police said. City officials Rocky B.
Gordon, 34, and David Thompson, 44, were killed, and city
maintenance worker Delmar Eugene Dunn, 51, and Bunker police chief
Steve Stoops, 41, were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Following the shooting, police said Watson fled into the forest
armed with a semiautomatic assault rifle.

	   BRIGANTINE, N.J. (AP) - The numder of dead sea turtles that have
washed up here, in Sea Isle City and the Holgate section of Long
Beach Island has reached 45 this year, according to the Marine
Mammal Stranding Center.
</P>
<P>
   That number, which includes turtles found Friday in those areas,

stranding technician at the center.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, a total of 78 dead turtles were handled by the center.

<HEADLINE> New Stroke Play Record Set  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) -- Jim Wilson fired a record-breaking
8-under 63 Saturday to take the lead after the opening round of
stroke play at the U.S. Mid-Amateur Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, of Chico, Calif., made nine birdies and one bogey to
break the 18-hole Mid-Amateur stroke-play record of 64, set by Tom
Kroll in 1994 and Bert Atkinson in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson birdied the final four holes at the 6,614-yard, par-71
Lower Cascades Course at The Homestead resort.
</P>
<P>
   ''I even missed two or three putts I can't believe I missed,''
Wilson said. ''I really had a shot at birdieing every hole on the
back nine.''
</P>
<P>
   John Poole of Birmingham, Ala., and Keith Decker of
Martinsville, Va., shot 3-under 68s to trail Wilson by five
strokes. Jeff Wilson of Suisun, Calif. and Tony DeLuca of Ashburn,
Va., followed with 2-under 69s. Defending champion Danny Green of
Jackson, Tenn., and 1999 runner-up Jerry Courville of Milford,
Conn., finished at 1-under 70.
</P>
<P>
   Stroke play concludes Sunday. The 264-player field will then be
reduced to 64 for match play, which begins Monday and runs through
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> 60 Killed in China Explosion  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HUTZLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Investigators believe a massive explosion on a
truck near the capital of China's tense Muslim northwest that
killed 60 people and injured 173 was likely an accident, but have
not ruled out terrorism, an official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The truck, which was carrying explosives for disposal, detonated
during Friday evening's rush hour on a major road in the western
suburbs of Urumqi in Xinjiang province. The blast thundered across
the city and sent a thick cloud of black smoke shooting upward,
residents said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 police, soldiers and medical personnel sealed off
the area, sifting through more than 20 scorched and damaged
vehicles and buildings for survivors, government officials and the
state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the initial evidence, police believe an accident caused
the blast, although they have not excluded terrorism, said an
official with the Xinjiang government's foreign propaganda office,
who only gave his surname, Zhang.
</P>
<P>
   But the explosion's timing and location -- in the carefully
guarded heart of a region with a history of separatist violence --
has raised doubts about the government's version and fears it might
be linked to Muslim separatists waging China's most violent
internal rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ''This accident is very strange,'' said Erkin Ekrem, leader of a
group advocating separatism for Xinjiang's Uighurs, the region's
largest Turkic Muslim ethnic group. He wondered why there were so
many explosives near Urumqi.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Zhu Rongji was in Urumqi Saturday, but Xinhua did not
report if he was in the city when the blast took place. Zhu met
Saturday with a Japanese trade delegation and former U.S. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, now an executive with financial giant
Citigroup, to promote a campaign to develop China's hinterland.
</P>
<P>
   Xinjiang is an oil-rich region that has long been China's buffer
with Central Asia, now awash with Islamic militancy. Increasingly
aided by groups in Afghanistan and other neighbors, Uighur
separatists have waged a bombing and assassination campaign against
Chinese and suspected collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   Although Urumqi is dominated by Chinese and has recently had
little unrest, it was the site of Uighur separatists' most
sophisticated and spectacular attack: the nearly simultaneous
detonation of bombs on three city buses in 1997. Nine people were
killed and 68 injured in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   An employee at the Materials Transport Co. in Urumqi who heard
Friday's explosion and ran more than a mile to the scene said he
counted 50 to 60 dead and saw the injured lying on roads and
sidewalks in numbers too great to count.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the scene was the charred truck, apparently a
military vehicle, said the man surnamed Chen.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the injured were blinded or crippled, a hospital worker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials declined to confirm the description, and
Zhang at the propaganda office demanded to know who had provided
the information.

<HEADLINE> Butler: Racists To Stay in Idaho  </HEADLINE>
By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAYDEN LAKE, Idaho (AP) -- Aryan Nations leader Richard Butler
vowed Saturday he will not leave northern Idaho, despite a $6.3
million judgment against his racist organization.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on the 20-acre Aryan Nations compound,
Butler said he did not have the $960,000 in cash bond that would be
required for him to appeal the judgment issued Thursday by a civil
jury Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But he said his neo-Nazi sect would continue, even if the
compound is seized to pay the judgment as he expects.
</P>
<P>
   ''They cannot run me out of northern Idaho with my tail between
my legs,'' Butler said from a church pulpit, standing next to a
silver bust of Adolf Hitler. He said he may seek a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   A jury found that Butler and his organization were negligent in
selecting and overseeing security guards who assaulted Victoria
Keenan and her son Jason in 1998. Jurors awarded the damages to the
Keenans, who were chased, shot at and assaulted after they stopped
their car near the entrance to the Aryan Nations' compound.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Dees, co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center in
Montgomery, Ala., represented the Keenans and has said he intends
to take everything the Aryan Nations owns to pay the judgment,
including the sect's name.
</P>
<P>
   Butler compared his trial to trials in the former Soviet Union
under dictator Josef Stalin. He said local ''politicians want to
improve the image of Idaho by mongrelizing the white race up
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Idaho politicians and community leaders expressed hope after
last week's judgment that Butler would leave the area and take his
organization with him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Butler, 82, has applied for a permit to hold another
parade down the streets of nearby Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, in October.
</P>
<P>
   He bemoaned the expected loss of the compound, which he bought
nearly 30 years ago and includes his home and church and has been
the site of annual gatherings by his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''This place was built on love,'' Butler said. ''It is a place
to worship with your own kind.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that two wealthy computer industry
executives who have been supportive of Butler in recent years might
come to his financial aid. But Butler said Saturday that he has not
asked Vincent Bertollini or Carl Story, both of Sandpoint, Idaho,
to pay the judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't have that kind of money,'' Butler said. ''We never
talked about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler also praised attorney Edgar Steele of Sandpoint for
taking his case, even though he said Steele did not share the Aryan
Nations' views.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mister Steele took the case for me out of his concern for
freedom of speech,'' Butler said. ''For the past two weeks, freedom
of speech has been on trial.''

   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- As pressure mounts on OPEC to pump more oil to stem
surging fuel prices, members of the petroleum producers' cartel said Saturday
they support raising their official output by at least half a million barrels a

Haider Chides Leaders on Sanctions
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Far-right politician Joerg Haider claimed political
victory over the leaders of France and Germany in comments published Saturday,
after a European Union panel recommended lifting sanctions against Austria that
the two leaders had supported. France's Foreign Ministry said Saturday it had
begun consulting with its EU partners over the panel report on the sanctions,
which were slapped on Austria after Haider's Freedom Party -- criticized for its
anti-immigrant stance -- was brought into the country's ruling coalition in
October. Haider said the report by the EU's so-called ''three wise men''
vindicated his party and Austria's present government and represented ''a
Waterloo'' for French President Jacques Chirac.

French Truckers Lifting Blockades

   PARIS (AP) -- French truckers began eliminating nationwide blockades at oil

France's gas stations still dry, however, the removal of blockades was not
expected to ease immediately the struggle faced by motorists who've been waiting
in line to fill their tanks. The Interior Ministry said 30 oil refineries and
fuel depots were still blocked as of Saturday evening, compared with more than
100 earlier in the day.

blocking racial harmony between Australia's earliest inhabitants and the whites
who followed in recent centuries. Activists placed tens of thousands of colorful
plastic cutouts in the shape of hands on the grounds of Sydney's Centennial
Park, where road cycling events are due to be held during the Sept. 15-Oct. 1

of rule, the party's president said Saturday. During a national forum, titled
''A party discussion: 'What to do?' Dulce Maria Sauri demanded that the party,

On July 2, Vicente Fox became the first opposition presidential candidate to
defeat a member of the PRI, which has ruled Mexico since its creation in 1929.

<HEADLINE> Fusion 6, United 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Diego Serna had three goals and an assist to
spark a five-goal second-half outburst as the Miami Fusion closed
out the regular season by beating DC United 6-2 Saturday night,
tying an MLS record for goals in one half by a team.
</P>
<P>
   Serna started the scoring for the Fusion when he gathered a long
pass from Jeff Bilyk seven minutes into the game that he beat DC
defender Carey Talley to. He then fired an uncontested shot from 17
yards past Tom Presthus for the only goal of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   After Serna set up Welton for a goal in the 46th minute, DC
closed the gap to 2-1 when Geoff Aunger scored his first goal of
the season during a scramble in front of the net.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 55th minute, a game that featured two non-playoff
teams, eight yellow cards, one ejection and handfuls of missed
opportunities became a rout.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (12-15-5, 41 points), which outshot DC 13-5, scored four
goals in a span of 10 minutes, including two more by Serna, to
establish a team record for most goals in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Serna scored in the 55th minute on a pass from Martin Machon,
who has assisted in an MLS record eight consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   After DC United (8-18-6, 30 points) helped the Fusion's cause
with an own goal in the 57th minute, Miami midfielder Kyle
Beckerman found himself unmarked in front of the DC net in the 58th
minute and scored on a header for his first goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Serna completed his hat trick in the 63rd minute on a pass from
Brian Kalmer, his 16th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, which was playing DC for the fifth time this season,
returned the own goal in the 79th minute to close out the scoring.

<HEADLINE> Report: China Jails 2 Buddhists  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A Chinese court has sentenced two members of a
Buddhist sect to jail for three years after convicting them under
an anti-cult law China is using to rein in religious and spiritual
groups, a human rights group reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The court in the eastern city of Ningbo accused Liu Yin and Gan
Suqin of being followers of Supreme Master Ching Hai and
proselytizing for her Guan Yin Famen sect, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy said.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested in February, the two were convicted and sentenced on
July 18, and having refused to appeal, they were sent to prison,
the group said, citing an officer in Ningbo's Haishu district
court.
</P>
<P>
   The account could not be immediately confirmed. The court was
closed for the weekend, and telephone calls went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   The communist government over the past 14 months has
aggressively suppressed popular religious and spiritual groups,
seeing them as threats to its power. While the chief target has
been Falun Gong, the biggest and best organized of the groups,
other health and meditation groups have been attacked, as have
Catholic and Protestant churches operating outside state control.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the campaign, the Communist Party-controlled
legislature toughened a law against cults last year, and law
enforcement agencies have increasingly applied it to arrest and
prosecute members of the targeted groups.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, police in central China last month arrested 85
members of an underground Protestant church for using a cult to
undermine the law -- the same charge used against the accused
followers of the Guan Yin Famen sect, the Hong Kong group reported.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Master Ching Hai is a Buddhist nun with a shadowy past
and a chain of restaurants and business ventures from Australia to
the United States. Believed to be from Vietnam, she has a broad
following in Taiwan and in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The Information Center said her group began winning converts in
China in 1992 and now has 500,000 followers across 21 provinces and
major cities.

<HEADLINE> Triathletes Get Taste of Harbor  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The South African stepped to the edge
of the dock, pulled on his goggles and prepared to dive into Sydney
Harbor for a warmup swim before the official test run of the
Olympic triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here comes the shark bait,'' Conrad Stoltz joked to a bunch of
Olympic volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   The triathlon course, which starts and finishes on the plaza in
front of Sydney's landmark Opera House, got its first workout on a
sunny, warm Sunday morning (Saturday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   And while many competitors have wondered what they'll encounter
in the placid harbor, any sharks who wandered onto the course
Sunday got quite a charge out of the event.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the practice run also was the first official
Olympic trial of the ''sharkpod,'' which sends out low-frequency
electromagnetic shocks to repel sharks. The devices were strapped
to five divers who escorted the triathletes throughout the harbor,
and will do the same during the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   A two-pound yellow and black sharkpod box was attached to the
oxygen tank, and a transmitter was strapped to the right fin, of
each diver. One diver also had a six-inch knife strapped to his
right leg, but he said it was for stray buoy ropes and not for
menacing fish.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no sharks in the harbor, there never have been,''
said David Moore, a Sydney high school student who is taking a
study break before exams by volunteering as an Olympic anti-shark
diver. ''It's all a total joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Nic Martin, the dive team leader and a former mine clearer for
the Australian Royal Navy, agreed there was virtually no chance of
a shark attack at the games. But he said his team is there to
reassure competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's understandable for athletes from regions that have no
shark activity to have that fear,'' he said. ''It's like if I went
to the southeastern United States and didn't know what to expect
about the alligators.''
</P>
<P>
   The last reported shark attack in Sydney Harbor was two years
ago. The last fatal attack was in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors Sunday said they were more bothered by the cold
water than concerns about man-eating sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are 54 other competitors for the sharks to eat,'' joked
Brazil's Armando Barcellos. ''I'm thin -- they wouldn't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutch triathlete Rob Barel, at 42 the oldest competitor in the
event, said the cold harbor took his breath away he first hit the
water. He said he knew there would be no sharks around.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a biologist, I know sharks are hesitant to get into a big
crowd of people,'' Barel said. ''But we really like the shark
stories, because they give us so much attention. In this sport we
need all the attention we can get. People will be watching to see
if there's blood on the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Men and women both participated Sunday in the test triathlon,
which includes a 1,500-meter swim, a 25-mile bicycle course through
Sydney's business district and the Botanical Gardens, and a 6&AMP;frac14;-mile
run.
</P>
<P>
   Triathlon is making its Olympic debut in Sydney, and the women's
triathlon this upcoming Saturday will be the first event at the
Sydney Games in which a medal is awarded. The men's triathlon will
be the following day.
</P>
<P>
   The plaza in front of the Opera House was transformed from its
usual scene of finely dressed concertgoers into a staging area for
the triathlon, with athletes stripping off wetsuits as they raced
from the water to their bicycles.
</P>

   Sailboats and ferries crisscrossed the harbor not far from the

to warn male triathletes there had been a false start and they had
to return to the starting line.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Saturday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Yankees-Red Sox:
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Fenway Park has been friendly to Jose Canseco and now
he's taking aim at one of the best hitters to play in the stadium.
His two-run homer in the ninth Saturday was his 23rd in the park as
an opponent, most among active major leaguers. His 445 homers are
just seven behind former Red Sox great Carl Yastrzemski's 452 for
22nd place all-time. ... CF Bernie Williams missed his fifth
straight game with a strained right rib cage. His replacement, Clay
Bellinger, went 0-for-3 with two strikeouts and is hitless in 13
at-bats. ... Trailing a star like Pedro Martinez doesn't faze the
Yankees. They won 5-3 after trailing 1-0 and, manager Joe Torre
said, ''We never stop. What got our guys going was the way Andy
(Pettitte) was pitching. They didn't want to waste that effort.''
... Derek Jeter's streak of reaching base in 34 straight games is
second in the AL this season to the 38 by David Justice before he
was traded from Cleveland to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Dante Bichette went 1-for-4 with a double and has nine
hits over his last five games. ... Red Sox infielders made two
throwing errors but neither led to a run. Lou Merloni made an
excellent stop of Tino Martinez's grounder in the second but threw
the ball past 1B Jose Offerman and into the dugout. In the fourth,
Martinez hit a grounder in the hole to Offerman, whose throw was
behind Pedro Martinez as he covered first. ... The last time the
Red Sox were as much as eight games out of first place was on Aug.
30, 1999. ... Pedro Martinez struck out at least one batter in each
of his previous 13 innings before failing to do that in the sixth.
White Sox-Indians:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: With RHP Cal Eldred on the DL and James Baldwin
suffering from tendinitis in his shoulder, the White Sox will have
to rely on young pitchers Jon Garland and Kip Wells in the final
weeks. Garland got belted around by the Indians on Saturday but
manager Jerry Manuel wasn't overly concerned. ''We survived so far
this year. All we need to do is get a couple of guys in the
starting rotation hot and I think we'll be OK.'' ... Frank Thomas
needs one homer and one RBI to set career highs. Thomas has 41
homers, matching his personal best set in 1993, his first MVP
season. He drove in two runs Saturday, giving him 134, which he
also reached in '96. ... Jason Bere, a key figure in the White
Sox's push to the playoffs in 1993 -- the last time they made the
postseason -- will be on the mound for Cleveland on Sunday in the
series finale.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: The Indians are billing Baltimore for damage Albert
Belle did to the visitor's clubhouse last week. Following his
at-bats, Belle would take a swig from a red-colored sports drink
and then walk through the clubhouse pouring the rest on the carpet.
Belle, who used to play in Cleveland and was booed throughout the
three-game series, also threw bottles and cans against the
clubhouse wall. Earlier this year, the Yankees billed the Orioles
after Belle threw beer cans through a wall in the clubhouse at
Yankee Stadium. ... OF Russell Branyan is expected to get most of
the playing time in left field with Wil Cordero possibly out for
the season after breaking his right pinky. Branyan has 14 homers in
131 at-bats. ''I like Russell's power,'' said Indians manager
Charlie Manuel. ''He's got a Mickey Mantle swing and a Mickey
Mantle strut.'' ... With Saturday's 9-3 win over Chicago, the
Indians improved to a major league best 32-12 in day games. ...
Cleveland has won 16 of its last 21 at home.
Tigers-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Tony Clark delivered a single in his first pinch-hit
at-bat of the season. ... OF Bobby Higginson is hitting .414
(13-for-33) over his last eight games. ... Brad Ausmus has nine
hits in his last 21 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Blue Jays are 18-5 against Detroit over the last
two seasons. ... David Wells has 12 walk-free games this season ...
Brad Fullmer's 30th home run gave Toronto three players with 30
homers for the second time in franchise history. Carlos Delgado has
39, and Tony Batista has 38. In 1998, Jose Canseco had 44, Delgado
hit 38 and Shawn Green hit 35. ... Billy Koch blew a save for the
first time since June 3 at Florida.
Rangers-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Since reaching .500 at 44-44 on July 15, the Rangers have
been below the break-even mark for 56 straight days. ... With four
more home runs, Rafael Palmiero will become the 32nd player in
major league history with 400.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Carlos Beltran, the regular center fielder, played
right field for the first time in his career. He'd never been in
right even in the minors. ... Royals' minor league prospect Chris
George pitched three hitless innings of relief and got the victory
in Team USA's 5-3 win over Australia on Saturday.
Twins-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins have not won a season series from Seattle
since 1992 and they trail the Mariners this season with a 3-7
record heading into Saturday. ... Minnesota has hit 25 home runs in
its last 26 games for a total of 109 through 141 games. ... Rookie
pitcher Mark Redman, the Twins' starter for Saturday's game, ranks
first among American League rookies in wins (12-8), strikeouts
(114) and winning percentage (.600). ... First baseman Ron Coomer
ranks as the fourth-toughest batter to strikeout in the AL, fanning
once in every 11.7 plate appearances.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: All-Star SS Alex Rodriguez entered Saturday's game
ranked 10th or better in 15 of the AL's 36 official offensive
categories. Rodriguez ranks first in road batting average (.365)
and second in runs scored (115) behind Kansas City's Johnny Damon.
He is also tied for seventh with 34 home runs and seventh with 109
RBIs. ...
Orioles-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: Cal Ripken, who has DH'd regularly since coming off
the DL Sept. 1 did so for the ninth time this season Saturday. He
had never served as the DH until this season. ... RHP Scott
Erickson, rehabilitating in Southern California since Aug. 8 elbow
surgery, has reunited with the Orioles and is back in uniform for
the weekend. ... C Brook Fordyce has thrown out only 2 of 33
runners since his acquisition on July 29 from the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Proceeds generated by the sale of nearly 7,000 dolls of
the Rally Monkey -- the new team mascot sensation -- have gone to a
couple of animal-rights groups, Center for Reproduction of
Endangered Species, and American Zoo &AMP; Aquarium Association. ...
The Angels are 3-27 when scoring two or fewer runs. ... With their
71st win Friday night, the Angels surpassed their 1999 total.
Devil Rays-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: 2B Bobby Smith sat out Friday's game to serve his
one-game suspension for fighting with Yankees catcher Jorge Posada
in the July 1 game at Tropicana Field. Smith, who was also fined
$1,000, unsuccessfully appealed his punishment during a brief
hearing Thursday. ... RHP Ryan Rupe was released from a Cleveland
hospital after doctors cleared a blood clot and a small blockage
from a vein in his right arm. ... Manager Larry Rothschild was back
on the bench after finishing his three-game suspension Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: RHP Jason Isringhausen is back in as closer. He was
removed from that role a week ago, with RHP Jim Mecir taking over
for the time being. ''If he's available and he's healthy, he's the
closer,'' A's manager Art Howe said. ''It's time to give him
another opportunity.'' Isringhausen, who hasn't appeared in a save
situation since Aug. 15, wasn't available Friday night because of
food poisoning. He threw before Saturday's to test his strength. OF
Jeremy Giambi was back in the starting lineup for the first time
since going on the 15-day DL Aug. 22. ''We need to get him some at
bats so he can help us,'' Howe said. ''It's time to get him in the
lineup.''
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Reds-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Sean Casey grew up in the Pittsburgh area and always
dreamed of playing in Three Rivers Stadium. The Pirates' home field
hasn't been the scene of much success for him, though. Before he
had a home run and triple in Friday's doubleheader, Casey had been
a .130 hitter at Three Rivers. He admits that he tries too hard
because he has so many family members and friends in the stands.
... Ken Griffey, Jr. wasn't supposed to play the second game of
Friday's doubleheader. But he told Manager Jack McKeon he wanted
to, so McKeon scrapped his plans to use Brian Hunter in center.
''If he says he's OK, that's good enough for me,'' McKeon said.
Griffey went 0-for-4 in the second game.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: The Pirates chose their minor league player and
pitcher of the year. The player was catcher J.R. House of the Class
A Hickory and the pitcher was right-hander Wilson Guzman of the
Double-A Altoona. House, Pittsburgh's fifth-round draft choice in
1999, batted .348 with 23 home runs and 90 RBIs in 110 games.
Guzman, a non-drafted free agent from the Dominican Republic, was
10-4 with a 3.02 ERA in 18 starts. ... Owner Kevin McClatchy said
the Pirates will fall short of their projected attendance. He
expects to wind up with a figure around 1.8 million and blames two
factors -- the shortage of parking spaces because of new stadium
construction and the team's poor play.
Diamondbacks-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: LHP Randy Johnson will celebrate his 37th birthday
Sunday while seeking a pair of milestones. Johnson is one strikeout
away from his fourth 300-strikeout season and eight Ks shy of
3,000. Only 12 other pitchers have recorded 3,000 career
strikeouts. ''It's really irrelevant if you go out there and strike
out a bunch of guys and the team loses. It doesn't mean that much
to me if I do that because I take pride in pitching a quality
game,'' Johnson said. ''I struck out 19 once against the Oakland
A's and lost. I take pride in being a better pitcher, not a better
strikeout pitcher. I might be known as a strikeout pitcher, but a
better pitcher is what I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: OF Henry Rodriguez was scratched Saturday following
batting practice. Rodriguez felt tightness in his left hamstring
and was listed as day to day. Mark Kotsay replaced him in right
field. ... Manager John Boles admits Johnson has a good chance of
reaching 3,000 strikeouts Sunday against the Marlins, and Boles'
only defense will be an all-right-handed lineup. ''Nobody wants to
be No. 3,000, but there's very little you can do about it. I'll
guarantee this: If it happens, it'll be a right-handed batter.''
Phillies-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Going into Saturday, the Phillies were 1-6 on
their nine-game road trip to Los Angeles, San Francisco and New
York. They scored just 13 runs in those games. ... Philadelphia
began Saturday last in the major leagues with 597 runs and
next-to-last in batting average (.251), ahead of only Milwaukee
(.245). ... With six shutouts, the Phillies have matched their 1999
total. ... Scott Rolen has hit 14 of his 23 home runs on the road.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: On The New York Times' op-ed page Saturday, columnist
Frank Rich proclaimed of Republican presidential nominee George W.
Bush: ''As far as I can discern, the only really daring move in Mr.
Bush's entire life was to fire Bobby Valentine as manager of the
Texas Rangers -- though Mr. Valentine has said that his dismissal
took the form of an hourlong love tap rather than a boot
administered by a decisive leader.'' Valentine's response? ''I
think that he was reaching.'' ... Day after on Mike Hampton's
dugout fit Friday: ''All the discussion about Mike Hampton's bout
with the water cooler seemed to be more smoke than fire,''
Valentine said. ''He's fine today. No ill effects.'' ... Valentine
blames himself for the Mets' September slump. ''It's my fault that
we're not scoring runs. It's the manager's fault. If a team's not
doing well, I think it's because the manager's not leading them
properly.''
Expos-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: 2B Jose Vidro, who had an MRI Friday on his left elbow
which revealed a partial tear of the ulnar collateral ligament, was
unavailable Saturday night and will be re-evaulated Sunday. He has
missed three straight games. ... Vladimir Guerrero, who went
3-for-3 in Friday night's 3-2 loss, raised his batting average to
.555 (15-for-27) against the Braves in seven games this season.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: LHP Tom Glavine (19-6) makes his 31st start of the
season on Sunday and will be seeking his fifth 20-win season. He's
12-1 in his last 13 starts. ... 1B Andres Galarraga served the
third and final game of his three-game suspension Saturday for his
part in a brawl at Colorado on Aug. 22 when he was hit by a pitch
from John Wasdin.
Dodgers-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: RHP Luke Prokopec will get his first major league
start on Tuesday at Arizona. ... Home runs by Adrian Beltre and
Chris Donnels gave the Dodgers 192, one more than the team record
in Los Angeles of 191 set in 1977. The franchise record is 208 set
in Brooklyn in 1953. ... Donnels hit the ninth pinch homer of the
season for the Dodgers this year, tying a franchise record
previously done in 1983 and again in 1992. ... The three errors
gave them an NL-leading 125 for the season. ... Eric Karros is
9-for-51 in his past 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: RHP John Wasdin served the second game of a two-game
suspension for his part in an Aug. 22 bench-clearing brawl with
Atlanta. ... Talks continued in the team's attempts to sign
first-round draft choice Matt Harrington and second-round pick
Jason Young. ... The Rockies are the only team in baseball to have
beaten Kevin Brown, Mike Hampton and Randy Johnson this year. ...
Todd Helton, who averages a strikeout every 12 at-bats, has fanned
six times in his last three games. ... When RHP Pedro Astacio was
ruled healthy enough to pitch Sunday, RHP Brian Rose was moved a
day from his scheduled start and Masato Yoshii was pushed back from
Saturday and will start Tuesday at San Diego. The moves were made
to give Astacio and Julian Tavarez each an additional start. ...
The Rockies are five games over .500 (73-58) for the first time
since the All-Star break when they were 45-40.
Padres-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: 3B Phil Nevin missed his third straight game with a
strained abdominal muscle. He will be re-evaluated when the Padres
return to San Diego on Monday, but is expected to miss at least a
week of action. In his absence, 37-year-old Dave Magadan got just
his 14th start of the season and hit cleanup. ... The Padres' eight
singles in the eighth inning on Friday were one shy of the
franchise's single-inning record. ... Ryan Klesko's two-run homer
on Saturday was just San Diego's 16th home run since Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: RHP Russ Ortiz's 20-inning scoreless streak was
snapped with the Padres' four-run rally in the third inning
Saturday. Ortiz, the NL's August Pitcher of the Month who had won a
career-best seven straight starts, hadn't allowed a run since Aug.
25. ... OF Armando Rios has flown home to Puerto Rico to be with
his family after his 81-year-old grandmother was struck and killed
by a bus. Rios is expected to rejoin the Giants in Houston on
Monday. ... Barry Bonds was given the day off. The Giants rested
Ellis Burks on Friday and plan to rest Jeff Kent on Sunday.
Astros-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: RHP Rick Aguilera is done for the season because of a
broken bone near his right thumb. Aguilera sustained the injury
Aug. 26 when he was hit by a comebacker by the Dodgers' Alex Cora
in the ninth. Aguilera, who has 29 saves in 37 opportunities, has
pitched since the incident. ''The pain I have now is as severe as
it was when I first did it,'' Aguilera said. Added manager Don
Baylor: ''He just can't grip the ball so it's time to sit him
down.'' ... RHP Kevin Tapani, who has been pitching despite
soreness in his back and right knee, also may be done for the year.
He was examined by team physicians Saturday and will miss the next
road trip to see specialists. ... 2B Eric Young extended his
season-high hitting streak to 13 games with a triple in the third.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: OF Moises Alou did not start, still bothered by a sore
right hamstring that forced him out of Friday's game. His status
was day to day. ... RHP Rusty Meacham made his Astros debut in the
ninth inning. ... OF Frank Charles recorded his first career hit
with a pinch-double in the ninth. ... The Astros hit seven homers
in a game for the first time all season.
Cardinals-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   CARDINALS: Mark McGwire made his second consecutive start at
second base Saturday after being activated from the disabled list.
The slugger was second in the batting order and popped out before
being replaced. ... McGwire, who had been out since July 7 with
tendinitis in his right knee, hit eight homers in 20 batting
practice swings. Two curled high over the left-field foul pole and
into the upper deck at County Stadium, and a third was nearly deep
enough to clear the single-tier bleachers in left.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: C Henry Blanco was held out of the lineup for the
third straight night with a sore right shoulder. Blanco is among
the major league leaders in throwing out runners attempting to
steal, having caught 37 of 65. ... Geoff Jenkins started in left
and took his customary third spot in the hitting lineup one night
after being hit on the left forearm with a pitch from Rick Ankiel.

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Mike Sorber scored in the 90th minute
Saturday night, giving Chicago a 3-2 win over the Columbus Crew
after the Fire blew a two-goal lead.
</P>
<P>
   An unguarded Sorber got a pass from Dema Kovalenko about 10
yards out on the left side and sneaked a left-footer past Crew
goalkeeper Mark Dougherty, who got his right hand on the ball but
couldn't make the save.
</P>

   Chicago (17-9-6, 57 points) took a 1-0 lead on Peter Nowak's
goal in the 23rd minute and made it 2-0 on Ante Razov's 18th goal

<HEADLINE> No. 20 Oklahoma 45, Arkansas St. 7  </HEADLINE>
By OWEN CANFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- Josh Heupel threw three touchdown passes
and J.T. Thatcher returned a punt 66 yards for a touchdown on his
way to a school record for returns as No. 20 Oklahoma beat Arkansas
State 45-7 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   All of Heupel's touchdowns came on third-and-long plays,
including two in the first half when the Sooners (2-0) took a 28-0
lead. His 35 career TD passes, accomplished in 13 games, tied the
school record set by Cale Gundy in 40 games from 1990-93.
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher had 160 yards on five returns, breaking the Oklahoma
record of 146 yards set last season by Jarrail Jackson against
Missouri. Thatcher also had an interception that set up a
third-quarter touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas State (0-2) didn't cross midfield until late in the
first half and was outclassed one week after losing at North
Carolina State in two overtimes.
</P>
<P>
   Heupel was 24-of-32 for 301 yards and, thanks to a 75-yard
touchdown run by Renaldo Works in the fourth quarter, the Sooners
topped 200 yards on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma's longest drive of the night was its first, an
80-yarder that Heupel capped with a 1-yard sneak.
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher then scored on his punt return, taking the ball right
up the middle before cutting to the outside and outrunning the
Indians to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-yard return by Thatcher and a personal foul against the
Indians set Oklahoma up at the Arkansas State 42 late in the first
quarter. The Sooners quickly drove inside the 10, but two penalties
left them with third-and-goal from the 26.
</P>
<P>
   That proved to be no problem for Heupel. On the first play of
the second quarter, he hit Damien Mackey deep along the left
sideline. Mackey ran through a defender near the goal line for
Oklahoma's third touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners made it 28-0 when Heupel, given plenty of time,
found Andre Woolfolk in the back of the end zone for a 19-yard
touchdown on third-and-8. The drive began after a 40-yard Thatcher
return.
</P>
<P>
   Heupel and Woolfolk collaborated on a touchdown again in the
third quarter, this time a 35-yarder on third-and-11. A 14-yard
return by Thatcher had set the Sooners up at midfield.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas State's only touchdown came on a 33-yard run by Danny
Smith in the second quarter.

OPEC Nations Back Oil Increase
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- As pressure mounts on OPEC to pump more oil to stem
surging fuel prices, members of the petroleum producers' cartel said Saturday
they support raising their official output by at least half a million barrels a
day. Oil ministers from Iran and Algeria said they would support an increase of
500,000 barrels a day -- or 2 percent above OPEC's current production -- when
they meet with their counterparts at a crucial meeting Sunday.

Report: China Jails 2 Buddhists
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A Chinese court has sentenced two members of a Buddhist sect
to jail for three years after convicting them under an anti-cult law China is
using to rein in religious and spiritual groups, a human rights group reported
Saturday. The court in the eastern city of Ningbo accused Liu Yin and Gan Suqin
of being followers of Supreme Master Ching Hai and proselytizing for her Guan
Yin Famen sect, the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and
Democracy said. Arrested in February, the two were convicted and sentenced on
July 18, and having refused to appeal, they were sent to prison, the group said,
citing an officer in Ningbo's Haishu district court.

French Truckers Lifting Blockades
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French truckers began eliminating nationwide blockades at oil
refineries and fuel depots Saturday once union leaders unanimously ended a
six-day protest that caused havoc at airports and gas stations. With most of
France's gas stations still dry, however, the removal of blockades was not
expected to ease immediately the struggle faced by motorists who've been waiting
in line to fill their tanks. The Interior Ministry said 30 oil refineries and
fuel depots were still blocked as of Saturday evening, compared with more than
100 earlier in the day.

Haider Chides Leaders on Sanctions

   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Far-right politician Joerg Haider claimed political
victory over the leaders of France and Germany in comments published Saturday,
after a European Union panel recommended lifting sanctions against Austria that
the two leaders had supported. France's Foreign Ministry said Saturday it had
begun consulting with its EU partners over the panel report on the sanctions,
which were slapped on Austria after Haider's Freedom Party -- criticized for its
anti-immigrant stance -- was brought into the country's ruling coalition in
October. Haider said the report by the EU's so-called ''three wise men''
vindicated his party and Austria's present government and represented ''a
Waterloo'' for French President Jacques Chirac.

Clinton, Barak Meet After Summit
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- President Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak met today to see if the Middle East peace negotiations could be salvaged,
as more than 150 world leaders headed home from the U.N. Millennium Summit. Most
of the top-level dignitaries left New York, armed with a challenge by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to use their power to give billions of people a
better life in the 21st century. But a few leaders, like Barak and Clinton, kept
up the diplomatic whirl, which included a meeting today between Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and Pakistan leader Pervez Musharraf at the
Waldorf-Astoria hotel.

'Big Brother' Members Mull Walkout

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rebellion was afoot today in the ''Big Brother'' house.
The reality show's six remaining contestants threatened to march out of the
camera-filled house in which they've been sequestered since July, forgoing their
shot at the $500,000 prize. ''Some things in life are more important than
money,'' one contestant said. The plot to walk out on Wednesday's upcoming live
show, when the next housemate was scheduled to be ousted, was made public on the
CBS show's companion Webcast on Saturday. Some players expressed doubt that all
would follow through on the pact.

Williams Wins U.S. Open Title
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two months after beating Lindsay Davenport at Wimbledon for
her first Grand Slam title, Venus Williams confirmed her place as the best in
the game, if not in the rankings, by beating Davenport again 6-4, 7-5 in the
hardest-hitting women's final in U.S. Open history. On the men's side, Pete
Sampras beat Lleyton Hewitt in a 7-6 (7), 6-4, 7-6 (5) victory. That put No. 4
Sampras in tomorrow's championship against No. 6 Marat Safin.

<HEADLINE> McCain Enters Budget Battle  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican Sen. John McCain, recruited by GOP
leaders for their budget fight with the White House, asked
Americans to vote out any lawmaker who would undermine the nation's
surplus with wasteful spending.
</P>
<P>
   The former presidential hopeful expressed suspicions that both
parties might share guilt by the time this year's budget is
enacted. He had especially harsh words for President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton does not want compromise, the Arizona senator said
Saturday in the GOP's weekly radio address, and will do anything to
defeat Congress in the annual battle, even at the cost of renewed
budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president is a charming fellow, and a heck of a
salesman,'' McCain said. ''But I wouldn't buy a used car from him
if I were you.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the government shutdowns of the mid-1990s, which
generally were blamed on the Republicans who run Congress, gave
Democrats an excuse to fault the GOP for any budget impasse. That
left the president a free hand to push through more spending, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Such rhetoric is what Republican leaders had in mind when they
talked McCain into taking a more visible role in the GOP budget
campaign, exploiting broad voter appeal McCain exhibited in the
Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   When he signed on to the campaign Thursday, however, McCain
warned that he planned to target anybody who tried to lard the
budget with pork-barrel projects or other unwarranted spending.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's talk, McCain kept his maverick image intact by
laying into Republican big spenders who push through bills
benefiting their own states or districts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry to say that in past years some of us have bargained
our way out of these annual budget battles by surrendering our
principles and joining the president in a no-holds-barred race to
the pork barrel, figuring that if we can't lick him, we might as
well join him,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't support a bill that risks our future for short-term
political gains, whether Democrats or Republicans are
responsible,'' he said. ''If in a few weeks, administration and
congressional negotiators emerge from a smoke-filled room carrying
another huge, pork-barrel spending bill, I'll vote against it, and
I'll ask you to vote against it too, on Nov. 7, Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Joel Johnson said the
administration agrees ''that Congress always loads these bills up
with pork-barrel spending. We also agree with Sen. McCain that the
Republican economic plan leaves nothing for Medicare and nothing
for Social Security and would keep us from paying off the debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''However,'' Johnson said, ''the president intends to stand firm
on the priorities he's outlined: putting more cops on the street,
more teachers in the classroom, modernizing our schools and adding
a prescription drug benefit to Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has earned a reputation for speaking his mind, especially
about the campaign finance system, tobacco and defense spending. In
the process, he has crossed his party's leaders, including Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   For example, McCain has criticized Lott for securing $1.5
billion for an amphibious assault ship that the Navy never
requested to be built in Lott's hometown of Pascagoula.
</P>
<P>
   Lott endorsed Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the eventual nominee,
over McCain in the GOP presidential race.

<HEADLINE> Missing sheriff's candidate back after three-week disappearance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MACCLENNY, Fla. (AP) - The candidate for Baker County sheriff
missing for three weeks - including returned home Saturday, raising
suspicions that he may have staged his own disappearance as a
political move.
</P>
<P>
   Agents from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement had been
searching for Julian Pendleton since he was reported missing Aug.
19 after he was seen heading to a candidate's forum. His pickup
truck was found near his home, its door ajar, the keys in the
ignition and his cell phone was on the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Pendleton declined to comment after leaving the sheriff's office
where he was questioned for four hours or return telephone calls to
The Florida Times Union.
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Julie Burnham told the newspaper that Pendleton left
town because he felt he was being harassed by deputies from
incumbent Sheriff Joey Dobson's office.
</P>
<P>
   Pendleton was issued a traffic citation and received a warning
several weeks ago for being disorderly at a grocery store. Deputies
also caught him dumping 50 pounds of sugar in a park, supposedly to
draw ants to disrupt Dobson's campaign kickoff cookout, which was
set for the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson called the harassment claim ridiculous and said
Pendleton's disappearance had a political motive.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the beginning, we thought this was a hoax,'' said Dobson,
who is seeking his second term. He will face Pendleton, the sole
Republican in last Tuesday's primary, in the November general
election. Dobson won the Democratic primary Tuesday with 68 percent
of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nickmeyer, FDLE supervisor of special agents, said Pendleton
told agents he had been in New Jersey for the past three weeks.
Nickmeyer said it is unlikely charges of intentionally perpetrating
a hoax would be filed against Pendleton.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing we set out to do was to make sure he got back safe
and sound. He is, and we feel we have done our job,'' Nickmeyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's Detective Lt. Chuck Brannan said Pendleton told
investigators he had been staying in New Jersey with a cousin,
James Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Brannan said the pair returned to northeast Florida each of the
past three weekends, with Woods dropping Pendleton at a motel
outside Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Woods could not immediately be reached for comment late
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Brannan said investigators were still trying to determine
whether Woods was compelled to report Pendleton's whereabouts to
police since he knew Pendleton had been reported missing.

<HEADLINE> Smith: Camara Will Stay at Ky.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Kentucky basketball coach Tubby Smith said
Saturday that junior forward Jules Camara decided to stay at the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Camara, arrested last weekend on a drunken driving charge,
pleaded innocent Friday. His former high school coach, Oak Hill
Academy's Steve Smith, said earlier in the week that Camara was
leaning toward transferring from Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   But the university issued a statement Saturday night, saying
Tubby Smith hoped to end speculation surrounding Camara.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have spoken with Jules on numerous occasions over the past
week -- as has my staff and our athletics director Larry Ivy -- and
Jules has decided to remain a Kentucky Wildcat,'' Smith said in the
statement. ''We are very pleased with his decision and look forward
to him rejoining our team in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Camara, a 6-foot-11 junior forward who was expected to start for
the Wildcats next season, was arrested early last Sunday and
charged with driving under the influence. Kentucky's no-tolerance
alcohol policy mandated that Camara be suspended indefinitely,
pending the outcome of his legal proceedings. A conviction would
cost him his scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Tubby Smith, who is in Australia with the U.S. Olympic
team, nor Ivy would comment further due to the pending legal case,
the university said.

<HEADLINE> IOC Head Is Left Waiting for a Ride  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Juan Antonio Samaranch was left
stranded at his hotel. But, hey, no one expected the Olympic
transportation system to work without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials celebrated a smooth trial run by trains and
buses Saturday during an opening ceremony dress rehearsal. And they
apologized for the gaffe in which the IOC president was forced to
wait at his hotel for a bus.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Roads and Transport Authority reported no major
problems as 81,000 commuters traveled by public transportation to
the Olympic Stadium for the first of two dress rehearsals for the
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ORTA spokesman Paul Willoughby said 81,000 people were
transported to and from the stadium, with 57,000 traveling by train
and 24,000 by bus.
</P>
<P>
   The only problems related to the dress rehearsal had nothing to
do with transportation -- fireworks capping the ceremony started
three grass fires, and a large sheet bearing the Olympic logo
shredded in a segment near the show's finale.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, though, transport officials were embarrassed
by a mixup that forced the International Olympic Committee's top
officials to cancel a tour.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch and other members of the IOC's executive board waited
20 minutes for a bus provided by Sydney Olympic organizers that was
supposed to take them to the International Broadcast Center for a
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were waiting for 20 to 25 minutes,'' Samaranch said Sunday
as he toured the Olympic Village. ''They said, 'Ten more minutes.'
It was not possible. I had something to do. I had a very important
meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of the transportation agency went to the IOC's hotel to
apologize to Samaranch, and a contrite Olympics minister Michael
Knight called him from Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   Willoughby said a misunderstanding resulted in the bus going to
the wrong pickup location -- the headquarters of the Sydney Olympic
organizing committee instead of the IOC's hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not a transport problem, it was a question of
dispatching,'' IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a little bit upset he could not go to the IBC, but he
understood the situation,'' Servan-Schreiber said. ''He is very
confident that ORTA can make it work for the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch denied a Sydney newspaper report that described him as
''furious.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was not angry. It was very easy to explain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the latest transportation problem confronting Sydney
Olympic officials, who have said for weeks their greatest concern
about the games is whether the transportation system can cope with
Olympic crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch and other IOC executive board members traveled -- by
bus -- to their Olympic Village tour Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bus was waiting this morning,'' Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
   Bus problems in the Olympic Village already have led to fears of
a repeat of the 1996 Atlanta Games, which were plagued by
transportation problems, and there have been major difficulties
with a new baggage system at Sydney Airport.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, hundreds of train passengers were stranded for up to
several hours at the Olympic Park station when strong winds knocked
down power lines and knocked out service.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Olympic organizers said they are striving to correct the
transportation problems, and IOC executive board member Jacques
Rogge said Thursday the organizers are simply dealing with
''teething problems'' that can be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a matter of capacity,'' Rogge said. ''It's a matter
of scheduling.''
</P>
<P>
   Columnist Peter Robinson wrote in The Sun-Herald that the
transportation problems simply are part of the Sydney experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Olympics have had one beneficial effect on Sydney life,
it is that they have exposed beyond any shadow of a doubt or any
chance of political obfuscation the disgraceful, ramshackle state
of our public transport system,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things that Sydneysiders have been forced for years to regard
as 'normal' are throwing overseas visitors, including Olympic
teams, into a right old tizzy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Buses and trains which are late or don't arrive. Drivers who
don't know where they are supposed to go and interminable waits for
the next overcrowded vehicle or train. For us locals it is all part
of a rich, continuing tradition.''

   WAYNESBURG, Pa. (AP) -- An Army reservist fixing a tarp on a
military jeep was killed in a hit-and-run crash Saturday and
another was injured, state police said.
</P>
<P>
   Their Army convoy was traveling near the West Virginia border

Joseph Howdyshell, 42, of Parkersburg, W. Va., police said. Burge
was thrown onto the roadway, where he was hit by a car and killed,
police said. Neither the truck nor the car stopped, police said.

   Howdyshell was listed in fair condition Saturday night at West

<HEADLINE> Rangers 6, Royals 5  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Gabe Kapler had two hits and two RBIs in
a six-run fourth inning that carried Texas past the Kansas City
Royals 6-5 Saturday night and gave the Rangers their first series
victory in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's Johnny Damon, who was 4-for-5 the night before,
went 3-for-5 with a two-run double. He also stole his AL-leading
42nd base and scored his league-leading 121st run.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers rookie Doug Davis retired the first nine batters but
failed to get out of the fifth inning and was replaced by Jonathan
Johnson
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zimmerman (4-5) pitched two scoreless innings to get the
win. John Wetteland got two outs for his 32nd save in 40th chances.
Jermaine Dye had an RBI single in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who won the first two games of the three-game
series, hadn't won a series since July 24-26 when they took two of
three from Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler ignited the Texas fourth with a leadoff single against
Mac Suzuki (8-9). A single by Ricky Ledee and a walk to Ruben
Sierra loaded the bases. Bill Haselman drove in a run with an
infield out and then Mike Lamb made it 2-0 with an infield RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   A third run scored on Suzuki's wild pickoff attempt to first,
then Luis Alicea's single drove in a run before Kapler's two-out,
two-run single made it 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki went 3 2-3 innings and gave up six runs on seven hits and
four walks. He had three strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, going for his third win in four decisions, allowed three
runs and five hits in 4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   He walked Mark Quinn leading off the fifth and gave up an RBI
single to Carlos Beltran before Damon's two-run double made it 6-3.
Damon singled leading off the seventh and made it 6-4 on Mike
Sweeney's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Royals' two double plays increased their AL-leading
total to 163. ... Kapler, who set a club record with a 28-game
hitting streak July 17-Aug. 15, has now hit safely in seven
straight. ... Beltran was playing right field for the first time in
his life. ... Damon's 191 hits are second in the AL to Darin
Erstad. ... The Texas half of the fourth took 30 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Lee Won't Concede Burris in Del.  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER THORNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- John Burris, the heavily favored state
House majority leader, narrowly beat retired judge Bill Lee in
Delaware's GOP gubernatorial primary by 44 votes, according to
preliminary totals Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who had conducted a grass-roots campaign and got his name
on the ballot to the surprise of party leaders, refused to concede
the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear to me that there's going to be a recount,'' Lee
told The Associated Press late Saturday. He said he would challenge
the results.
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware Department of Elections reported Burris had 13,887
votes to Lee's 13,843. The tiny Middle Atlantic state has nearly
169,000 registered Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican winner of the GOP primary will face Democratic
Lt. Gov. Ruth Ann Minner in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   An early poll by Mason-Dixon Polling &AMP; Research survey had
Minner with a 20 percentage point margin in separate head-to-head
matchups against both Lee and Burris. Incumbent Democratic Gov. Tom
Carper is running for the U.S. Senate against Sen. Bill Roth, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech Saturday, Burris said he would take the
primary victory, even with the slim margin. He appealed in his
speech for party unity in the 58 days left before the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   ''Forty votes is a great result,'' Burris said. ''Everybody
knows we have to pull together for November.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary race favored Burris, who was nicknamed the
''Ayatollah'' for his forceful leadership in the House. He was most
recently president of the state Chamber of Commerce, primarily a
lobbying post in a state known for its friendliness to business,
but quit that job so he could campaign full-time.
</P>
<P>
   Burris won the endorsement of state Republicans at their May
convention, and as of Aug. 10 he still had $485,441 left of the
$1.1 million he raised for his campaign. Lee estimated Friday he
had only $55,000 left in his campaign accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly, we thought Bill would have dropped out, especially
after the showing of support I had at the state convention,''
Burris told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who stepped down from state Superior Court last fall after
22 years on the bench, hoped to take advantage of his public
recognition from presiding over the sensational murder trial of
Thomas Capano, a politically connected lawyer convicted of killing
his mistress, who was a secretary for Carper. Capano was sentenced
to death.
</P>
<P>
   Lee put his faith in a grass-roots campaign of more than 1,000
volunteers. Many of his supporters were disenchanted Republicans
getting involved in politics for the first time, or Democrats who
switched parties to support him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the money, it's ideas that count,'' Lee said. ''John
has raised four times as much money. We knew we had to run an
efficient campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 7, Brewers 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Ray Lankford homered leading off the ninth, and
Mike Matheny homered and singled twice to pace a 15-hit attack,
helping the St. Louis Cardinals edge the Milwaukee Brewers 7-6
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight game, Mark McGwire batted second. He
popped out to shortstop in his two-pitch at bat and failed to
advance J.D. Drew, who led off with a single. Jim Edmonds followed
with an RBI double. McGwire, who was in the lineup at second base,
did not take the field.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee's Luis Lopez had a two-run homer off Matt Morris in
the eighth to tie the game 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   But Lankford opened the ninth with his 23rd homer, a solo shot
off the fourth Brewers reliever, Juan Acevedo (3-6).
</P>
<P>
   Dave Veres (3-4) came on with two outs in the eighth and held
the Brewers hitless for 1 1-3 innings to get the win.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals starter Pat Hentgen allowed seven hits in six innings
with four walks and four strikeouts. He remained 6-0 in nine career
games at County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers tied the game at 4 in the fifth on Richie Sexson's
RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Matheny's solo home run and Placido Polanco's RBI single off
Jimmy Haynes in the sixth regained the lead for St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes gave up and six runs and 12 hits in 5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals went ahead 4-3 in the third, scoring three runs on
five singles and a throwing error by right fielder Jeromy Burnitz.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds and Lankford singled, and Edmonds scored on Fernando
Tatis' single. Burnitz's throw to third sailed over third baseman
Jose Hernandez and landed in the Cardinals' dugout. Lankford was
awarded home and Tatis advanced to second. Edgar Renteria knocked
in Tatis with a single.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers took a 3-1 lead in the first on Burnitz's two-run
triple and Hernandez's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: When Renteria was caught stealing in the third, it stopped
him from reaching 20 steals in a season for the fourth straight
time. ... OF Geoff Jenkins was back in Milwaukee's lineup after
leaving in the third inning of Friday night's game. He had a
bruised left forearm after being hit by Rick Ankiel's pitch. ...
Polanco started in the field at second for the Cards. Craig
Paquette started Friday night's game and committed the ninth-inning
error that gave the Brewers a 6-5 victory. ... Sexson extended his
hitting streak to a career-high 10 games.

<HEADLINE> No. 16 UCLA 24, Fresno St. 21  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- An obviously upset UCLA coach Bob Toledo
insisted the 16th-ranked Bruins didn't suffer a letdown against
Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   Performance, especially at the quarterback position, was the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   DeShaun Foster ran for two fourth-quarter touchdowns, and the
No. 16 Bruins withstood two late scoring passes from David Carr to
Charles Smith for a 24-21 victory over the Bulldogs on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're 2-0, but I am very concerned,'' Toledo said. ''We have
to get a better performance from our quarterback position to be
successful. We have to pick up blitzes, we have to see guys open,
we need to get better fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who beat then-No. 3 Alabama 35-24 in their opener,
face current No. 3 Michigan next Saturday at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   When asked who the quarterback will be, Ryan McCann or Scott
McEwan, Toledo replied: ''I don't know, I've got to think about it.
We'll talk about it Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting quarterback Cory Paus separated his throwing shoulder
on the first play of the Alabama game and will be sidelined for at
least two more weeks. McCann was effective against the Crimson
Tide, but not against Fresno State, at least in the view of Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   McCann threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Freddie Mitchell in the
first quarter, but was relieved by McEwan after completing 12 of 23
passes for only 106 yards in the first half. McEwan was 5-of-10 for
29 yards while playing the entire second half.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had no rhythm in the first half, we had no consistency,''
Toledo said. ''That's why I made the change. I gave Scott the
chance, and he did a nice job.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo gave Fresno State credit for giving his team a difficult
time, but added firmly, ''We did not execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster scored on a 1-yard run on fourth-and-goal with 11:16
remaining, and a 49-yard burst less than 2&AMP;frac12; minutes later to give
the Bruins what appeared to be an insurmountable 24-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   However, Carr threw scoring passes of 16 and 32 yards to Smith
to make it a three-point game with five minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs (0-2) got the ball back with 2:39 left at their own
34, and moved to the UCLA 43 before Carr fumbled a snap from center
and Marques Anderson recovered with 1:17 remaining for the game's
only turnover. The Bruins then ran out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't even think about the snap, the fumble just
happened,'' Carr said. ''I would have ripped my arm off to get it
back. But it didn't happen. I don't think we ran out of time, we
could have and should have won.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were given all they could handle by Fresno State, a
14-point underdog. The Bulldogs finished with 275 yards of total
offense to 270 for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard when you work this hard and lose,'' Fresno State
coach Pat Hill said. ''We've had a lot of games like this. This is
not a moral victory, I'm only interested in wins. We had control of
this game. When we got down, a lot of teams would have quit. We
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster, who gained a career-high 187 yards on a school
record-tying 42 carries against Alabama, picked up 140 yards on 29
attempts. He had only 48 yards on 15 carries in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Carr completed 20 of 33 passes for 249 yards and three
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a great game until the fourth quarter,'' UCLA
cornerback Ricky Manning Jr., who is from Fresno, said of the
Bruins' defense. ''We were not surprised by the way they played.
The emotion didn't decide the game, it was execution. The team that
played the better football won this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so, but barely.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins got off to a disastrous start. After failing to get a
first down on the opening series, punter Nate Fikse was unable to
handle the snap from Jeff Grau and lost 23 yards to the UCLA 6.
Three plays later, Carr threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to freshman
Alec Greco to give the Bulldogs a quick lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins then moved 83 yards to tie the game on the
McCann-to-Mitchell pass. The Bulldogs helped out greatly by
committing three personal fouls on the drive.
</P>
<P>
   Fresno State was penalized 10 times for 116 yards overall,
prompting Hill to say: ''I'm not going to complain about the
penalties. You saw the same game I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams blew scoring chances in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Smith returned a punt 75 yards to the UCLA 7, but tripped in the
open field to keep him from scoring. Then, James Tillman was held
to no gain on a fourth down running play from the 2.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said his foot barely brushed a teammate, causing him to
take an odd step and fall.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA drove to the Bulldogs' 13 immediately thereafter, but
Foster was held to no gain on a fourth-and-1 play.
</P>
<P>
   The game was played before a crowd of 45,605 at the Rose Bowl,
where 76,640 watched the Alabama-UCLA game.

OPEC Nations Back Oil Boost
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- As international pressure mounts on OPEC to pump more
oil to stem surging fuel prices, members of the petroleum producers' cartel said
Saturday they supported raising their official output by at least half a million
barrels a day. Oil ministers from Iran and Algeria said they would back an
increase of 500,000 barrels a day -- or 2 percent above OPEC's current
production -- when they meet with their counterparts at a crucial meeting Sunday
in the Austrian capital. Saudi Arabia is OPEC's biggest producer and its only
member with significant spare capacity to pump new oil.

   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- John Burris, the heavily favored state House
majority leader, narrowly beat retired judge Bill Lee in Delaware's GOP
gubernatorial primary by 44 votes, according to preliminary totals Saturday
night. The Delaware Department of Elections reported Burris had 13,887 votes to
Lee's 13,843. The tiny Middle Atlantic state has nearly 169,000 registered
Republicans. Lee, who had conducted a grass-roots campaign and got his name on
the ballot to the surprise of party leaders, refused to concede the primary
Saturday night. Burris is expected to face Democratic Lt. Gov. Ruth Ann Minner
in the November election.

French Truckers Lifting Blockades

<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French truckers began lifting nationwide blockades at oil
refineries and fuel depots Saturday after union leaders unanimously called for
an end to a six-day protest that has strangled fuel supplies, causing airport
delays and chaos at gas stations. With a majority of France's gas stations still
dry, however, the removal of blockades was not expected to ease immediately the
plight of motorists, who have had to line up bumper-to-bumper to fill their
tanks. The Interior Ministry said 30 oil refineries and fuel depots were still
blocked as of Saturday evening, compared with more than 100 earlier in the day.

   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Far-right politician Joerg Haider claimed political
victory over the leaders of France and Germany in comments published Saturday,
after a European Union panel recommended lifting sanctions against Austria that
the two leaders had supported. France's Foreign Ministry said Saturday it had
begun consulting with its EU partners over the panel report on the sanctions,
which were slapped on Austria after Haider's Freedom Party -- criticized for its
anti-immigrant stance -- was brought into the country's ruling coalition in
October.

Clinton, Barak Discuss Peace
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- President Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak met Saturday to see if the Middle East peace negotiations could be
salvaged, as more than 150 world leaders headed home from the U.N. Millennium
Summit. Most of the top-level dignitaries left New York, armed with a challenge
by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to use their power to give billions of people a
better life in the 21st century. But a few leaders, like Barak and Clinton, kept
up the diplomatic whirl, which included a meeting Saturday between Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and Pakistan leader Pervez Musharraf at the
Waldorf-Astoria hotel.

Clinton Pushes For Wildfire Aid
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton proposed spending about $1.6 billion to
help communities recover from the forest fires that have scorched the West this
summer and to thin millions of acres of federal forests in hopes of preventing
future blazes. A report submitted Saturday to Clinton by two Cabinet secretaries
said the increased removal of trees and brush is needed to reverse almost a
century's worth of firefighting policy that left forests with acres of
undergrowth and ready-to-burn timber. Clinton also announced the release of
nearly $40 million for 90 restoration projects across the West, where fires have
charred 6.5 million acres and 38 large fires continue to burn across nine
states.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 7, Twins 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Alex Rodriguez made sure the Seattle Mariners
weren't victimized by a rookie pitcher for the second consecutive
night.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle jumped on Minnesota starter Mark Redman early as the
Mariners pounded out a 7-2 victory over the Twins on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star shortstop Rodriguez drove in a run in each of his four
plate appearances, finishing 3-for-3 with four RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle starter Jamie Moyer (12-9) ended a six-game losing
streak, giving up four hits in seven innings as Seattle maintained
its two-game lead over Oakland in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez is hitting .460 (19-for-41) with four homers and 16
RBIs in 11 games against the Twins this season.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's double into the left-field corner scored Mike
Cameron from first base in the first inning. Rodriguez came around
to score when Edgar Martinez singled into the same corner.
</P>
<P>
   Torii Hunter responded with a double to right-center to score
Ron Coomer from third and pull the Twins within 2-1 in the top of
the second. Minnesota threatened to add more runs, but Mariners
third baseman David Bell made a leaping grab on a line drive by
Jason Maxwell and fired to second to get Hunter for an
inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud pushed Seattle's lead to 7-2 with a two-run double
over left-fielder Denny Hocking's head in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Redman (12-9) lasted just five innings as he was unable to
duplicate teammate Matt Kinney's strong performance on Friday,
which resulted in his first major league victory. Redman, who also
lost to Seattle on June 15, gave up four earned runs and six hits
before giving way to Hector Carrasco.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer ended a 1&AMP;frac12; month drought, avoiding moving within one loss
of his career-high total of eight consecutive losses, which spanned
from April 12, 1991 to May 30, 1993. Moyer's previous win came on
July 24 against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez belted a solo home run, his 35th of the season, to
lead off the bottom of the third inning for Seattle. Rodriguez
slammed Redman's 2-2 pitch into the Seattle bullpen -- 382 feet away
-- to boost the lead to 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez pushed Seattle's lead to 4-1 when he brought home
Rickey Henderson from third on a deep sacrifice fly to center field
in the bottom of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: CF Hunter robbed Dan Wilson of a 400-foot-plus homer with a
leaping catch in the second inning. Hunter slammed hard into the
center-field wall to make the grab and took almost five minutes to
regroup before play resumed. ... Out of 70 home games this season,
the Mariners have played 11 with the retractable roof closed at
Safeco Field. The possibility of rain was the reason the roof was
shut Saturday. Seattle is 8-3 with the roof closed. ... Minnesota
lost for the fourth time in six games. ... Henderson bounced a
ground-rule double into the Mariners' bullpen for his 485th career
double, moving him into a tie for 45th on baseball's career list
with Vada Pinson and Harold Baines. ... The Mariners tied a club
record for walks in a season with 670.

<HEADLINE> No. 11 Southern Cal 17, Colorado 14  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- David Newbury, who missed two earlier field-
goal tries, kicked a 24-yarder with 13 seconds left to lift No. 11
Southern California to a 17-14 victory over Colorado on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Mark Mariscal left the game tied when he was wide
left on a 41-yard field goal attempt with 1:14 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Carson Palmer drove the Trojans 72 yards to the winning field
goal, completing third-down passes of 23 yards and 19 yards to
Kareem Kelly, with the second reception putting the ball at the
Colorado 21.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer threw for 275 yards and one touchdown for the Trojans
(2-0) and Kelly had 10 receptions for 143 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' win overshadowed a 150-yard rushing performance by
freshman tailback Marcus Houston of Colorado (0-2). Houston,
starting in place of the injured Cortlen Johnson, carried 25 times.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was just the fourth ever in football between the two
schools, and USC has won all the games.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffaloes tried a desperation multiple lateral deep in their
own territory when they took the final kickoff, but the Trojans
finally smothered Jashon Sykes with the ball at the Colorado 10.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Pesavento replaced Zac Colvin at quarterback for Colorado
with 4:10 left in the third quarter and immediately guided the
Buffaloes to a touchdown that evened the game at 14.
</P>
<P>
   After throwing an incompletion, Pesavento connected with Dan
Graham on a 36-yard scoring play, with the 6-foot-3, 240-pound
tight end breaking one tackle at the USC 25 then diving over
another defender at the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   USC had gone up 14-7 early in the third quarter, after Troy
Polamalu recovered Colvin's fumble and returned it 14 yards to the
Colorado 21.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' Sultan McCullough, who carried 28 times for 91
yards, scored on 5-yard run 2:45 into the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After squandering chances for most of the first two quarters,
each team scored a touchdown late in the half.
</P>
<P>
   After USC scored 3:47 before halftime, the Buffaloes came back
to even it with an 80-yard drive capped by Colvin's 11-yard TD
throw to Javon Green.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer completed a 19-yard pass to Kelly and a 26-yarder to
Keary Colbert during the Trojans' first-half scoring drive. On
third-and-goal from the Colorado 8, Matt Nickels ran a slant across
the middle and Palmer drilled the ball into him between two
defenders.
</P>
<P>
   USC had taken the opening kickoff and driven to the Buffaloes'
17, but Robbie Robinson intercepted a tipped pass in the end zone
to end that threat. On their second possession, the Trojans marched
to the Colorado 13 before that drive stalled, and Newbury missed a
30-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Newbury also missed from 45 yards in the third quarter before
making the game-winning kick.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffaloes also had a chance to take the lead early, but the
Trojans' Bernard Riley blocked Mariscal's 28-yard field goal try
with 37 seconds left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, Colorado's regular tailback, sustained a toe injury in
the Buffaloes' 28-24 loss to Colorado State in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   USC beat Penn State 29-5 in the Kickoff Classic two weeks ago,
then had a bye week.

<HEADLINE> Expos 7, Braves 5  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SALADINO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Brian Schneider drove in the go-ahead run with a
sacrifice fly and Tomas De La Rosa added an RBI single in the 12th
inning Saturday night as the Montreal Expos beat the Atlanta Braves
7-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, despite having their four-game winning streak
snapped, remained 3&AMP;frac12; games ahead of the New York Mets in the NL
East. The Mets lost 6-3 to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero made the win possible for the Expos, hitting a
two-run homer and throwing out the potential winning run in the
10th.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos won it in the 12th off reliever Chris Seelbach (0-1),
Atlanta's eighth pitcher who was making his major league debut.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Blum opened the inning with a single and after Andy Tracy
fouled out trying to sacrifice, Mike Barrett singled Blum to third.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider followed with his sacrifice fly to left and De La Rosa
then drilled a single to center for another run.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Santana (1-5), the Expos seventh pitcher, got the win for
the Expos with two scoreless innings of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero, hitting .548 with three homers and 12 RBIs against
Atlanta this season, hit his 35th homer in the sixth inning to give
Montreal a 5-3 lead. But the Braves tied it with two runs in the
eighth on a solo homer by Reggie Sanders -- his eighth -- and a
two-out RBI single by Rafael Furcal. Both runs were charged to
reliever Steve Kline.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero threw out Keith Lockhart at home in the 10th. Lockhart
led off the inning with a single and took second on a sacrifice. He
then tried to score from second on Furcal's line single to right
off Guillermo Mota. Guerrero's one-hop throw home easily nailed
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Ligtenberg came on in relief of Mike Remlinger in the
ninth with the bases loaded and one out and struck out Guerrero on
a 1-2 slider, then retired Blum on a grounder to first.
</P>
<P>
   In the 11th, with two outs and a runner on first, Guerrero
drilled a wicked liner that Sanders caught in right as it was
hooking away from him.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Tracy hit a three-run homer off Burkett in the fourth after
singles by Fernando Seguignol and Guerrero. Tracy's eighth homer
gave the Expos a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett gave up five runs and eight hits in five-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Expos starter Mike Thurman pitched 6 2-3 innings. He allowed
three runs, seven hits, walked two and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves got a pair of runs in the first off Thurman on a
two-run double by Brian Jordan and tied it at 3 in the fourth on a
sacrifice fly by Keith Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Seguignol went 3-for-4. The three hits matched his career
high. He also had three hits on July 23 against Florida. ... Jordan
left the game in the seventh after fouling a ball off his right
foot in his sixth inning at-bat. X-rays were negative and he's day
to day. ... Burkett hasn't won since beating Houston 8-4 on July
29, six weeks ago. He's 0-2 with four no-decisions in six starts.
... The crowd of 47,775 was Atlanta's 21st sellout of the season.
... The Braves used 26 players -- a franchise record -- including
eight pitchers, which matched a franchise record. The Expos used 21
players.
