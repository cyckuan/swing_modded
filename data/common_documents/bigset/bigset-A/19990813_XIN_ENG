<HEADLINE> Britain Sends Group to Liberia After Workers Abducted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, Aug 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Thursday it was
sending a group of officials to Liberia to help the local
government to obtain the release of a group of Western workers
abducted there.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Office Minister Geoffrey Hoon said in a statement that
he had asked the British ambassador in Ivory Coast, a neighbour
country to Liberia, to go immediately to Liberian capital Monrovia
with a small team "to make direct contact with the Liberian
government, and to offer any advice and assistance they need".
</P>
<P>
Hoon said Britain had already been in contact with Liberian
government officials and "they agree that the safety of those who
have been abducted is of paramount importance.
</P>
<P>
"The Liberian government have made it clear that they wish to
see the incident resolved peacefully by negotiation," Hoon said.
</P>
<P>
"We look to the Liberian government to ensure the safe release
of all hostages as soon as possible," said the foreign office
minister.
</P>
<P>
The aid workers, including four Britons, a Norwegian and an
Italian, were abducted by an armed gang in Liberia on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Lukashenko: Russian Government Change Won't Affect Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko expressed confidence Thursday that the government
change in Russia will make no impact on the two country's union.
</P>
<P>
"The union is a sacred objective aimed at the future. Therefore
it's impossible to slow it down," Lukashenko said in Gomel,
Belarus, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said attempts to draw out the integration process might
instead make "the unification process more radical."
</P>
<P>
In response to a draft of the union treaty taken from Moscow to
Minsk, he said, Belarus "proposed a more radical unification
option," envisioning such posts as union president,
vice-president, parliament and government.
</P>
<P>
"Russia honestly and sincerely said that it cannot accept this
proposal. In effect, the Russian draft will be adopted," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said both former Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin and
Vladimir Putin, his replacement, had worked on the draft treaty.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, Stepashin's stepping down and Putin's appointment
does not mean that we have stopped in the unification process,"
Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
"The process of creating a union continues slowly, the way it
did previously," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano Thursday called on the youth in the country to fight the
AIDS scourge.
</P>
<P>
He made the call at a rally marking the World Youths Day here
in the capital, saying AIDS has posed a great threat to the youth
and further to the development of the country.
</P>
<P>
The rally, which drew over 1,000 attendants, is presided by the
National Youth Council with the help of the Mozambican government
and the United Nations Population Fund.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, there are 700 people getting
infected with the AIDS virus daily in his country. Among AIDS
patients in Mozambique, 42 percent are youths aged between 15 to
29.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Mozambique's Deputy Health Minister Abdul Razak
said the southern African country will launch an intensive
campaign against AIDS with the support of the United Nations so as
to control the ever increasing infection rate.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the infection rate of AIDS in Mozambique is between
10 to 15 percent, he added.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Says Anti-Yugoslav War Is Not Over DPA357PAB251I12TEQL03:2603:261174 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Yugoslav
diplomat said here Thursday that the end of NATO's military
aggression "does not mean the end of war at all" against the
Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission
to the United Nations, told a press conference here that the peace
does not arrive in his country "because after the end of the
military aggression, NATO, headed by the U.S. Government,
continues the aggression against Yugoslavia by other means."
</P>
<P>
"The economic war is continuing, propaganda war is spreading
out, (and) underground war, subversive action is underway," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic, who is former Yugoslav foreign minister, made the
statement when presenting a book entitled "NATO Crimes in
Yugoslavia -- Documentary Evidence."
</P>
<P>
The ongoing action by NATO "is not the language of peace,
cooperation, stability and prosperity in the region," he said.
"This is the language of instability and inviting trouble in the
region," long considered "the powder keg of Europe."
</P>
<P>
The white book, compiled during the NATO aggression, is the
first volume which contains information and evidence about crimes
committed by NATO and its member states against Yugoslavia from
March 24 and April 24.
</P>
<P>
"The book No. 2 is to be published soon," Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO began air strikes on Yugoslavia, a sovereign
member of the U.N. family, without the authorisation of the U.N.
Security Council, which has the primary responsibility for the
maintenance of international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
NATO staged "anti-Yugoslavia propaganda campaign in order to
cover up their crimes against sovereign population" in Yugoslavia,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The aggression itself, representing the crime against peace,
is the first and greatest crime," he said, "The crime of genocide,
crimes against humanity and war crimes were also committed."
</P>
<P>
NATO launched 25,200 sorties of war planes over the territory
of whole Yugoslavia, dropping 25,000 tons of explosives, he said.
"Altogether, 1,100 war planes and other most sophisticated
weaponry have been busy against Yugoslavia for nearly two months."
</P>
<P>
"NATO was unselective about its victims. Children, women and
the elderly perished, as well as mothers with their newborn
babies, patients on dialysis, refugee columns, journalists and TV
crews on assignments, farmers in the fields, vendors on produce
markets, passengers in buses and trains, people crossing bridges,"
said the book, which contains informative photos and figures on
NATO crimes.
</P>
<P>
"Among the killed civilians, 30 percent are children, while the
share of children among the wounded is even higher -- 40 percent,"
said the white book.
</P>
<P>
"The NATO military aggression is not the eye-to-eye encounter,
and there was an action by the most advanced weaponry and the
inhumane weapons," including radioactive weapons and cluster
bombs.
</P>
<P>
The NATO aggression is a war "between the invisible side in the
air and the helpless side on the ground," he said, referring to
the air attacks by advanced U.S. war planes from a very big
distance from the targets.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- AIDS infections in
Eastern Europe rose nine-fold in just 3 years from less than
30,000 HIV cases in 1995 to some 270,000 by December 1998, a U.N.
agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has been the most dramatically affected and infections
in Belarus, Moldova, Kazakhstan and Russia have also grown, said
United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in a press release
issued at the U.N. headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
The agency said approximately 80 percent of infections are in
individuals who inject drugs.
</P>
<P>
UNAIDS calls for greater participation of people living with or
affected by HIV/AIDS in AIDS prevention programs due to their
unique contribution to the cause.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Calls on KFOR to Honor U.N. Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The whole situation in
Kosovo, the Yugoslav province, "is very far from being
satisfactory" because the international peacekeepers, known as
KFOR, and the U.N. mission (UNMIK) "haven't implemented the
provisions (in the U.N. resolution) that related to themselves," a
senior Yugoslav diplomat said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission
to the United Nations, told a press conference here that
disarmament of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) "is very slow."
</P>
<P>
"There should be no vacuum gap in security in Kosovo" after the
withdrawal of Yugoslav security forces under a military technical
agreement signed between Belgrade and NATO in June, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, KFOR began its deployment immediately
after Belgrade pulled its security and military forces out of the
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, KFOR and UNMIK have implemented the provisions
(of the U.N. resolution) which related to themselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted on June 10 a resolution,
calling for a political solution of the Kosovo crisis with the
respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav ambassador blamed KFOR for not preventing rebel
KLA from entering Kosovo from neighboring Albania, he said.
</P>
<P>
KLA, an armed rebel group campaigning for independence of
Kosovo, staged a comeback in Kosovo and seized power in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
"The disarmament of KLA has not been treated in a serious
manner from the very beginning," he said.
</P>
<P>
The situation has become a serious concern not only for
Belgrade, but also for the U.N. Secretary-General and the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"If the situation develops in that way, the real danger is that
it can get out of control," he said. "Nobody knows where it can
lead."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Yugoslav Mission has sent a memorandum to the
U.N. Secretary-General and the Security Council, "stating very
concretely our objections and request immediate and efficient
action by the KFOR and UNMIK," he said.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat Discuss Mideast Peace Process on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Thursday discussed over
telephone ways of reviving the Mideast peace process, especially
the Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reviewed the latest efforts exerted by the
Palestinians and Israel in their talks on a timetable for the
implementation of the Wye peace accord, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Wye Accord signed last October in Washington stipulates
that Israel must pull back from another 13.1 percent of the West
Bank in three phases and release hundreds of Palestinian political
prisoners. But Israel suspended the accord in early December only
after carrying out the first stage.
</P>
<P>
The telephone conversation was part of the continued
coordination and consultations between the two leaders, the news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979, plays a key role in mediating the peace talks
between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel have reached tentative agreement on
carrying out other aspects of the accord on September 1 and troops
pullback in October.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides are still at loggerheads over when the final
phase of the withdrawal should be completed. The Palestinians have
said the Wye deal should be carried out by mid-November while
Israel was offering to implement the final-phase pullback by
January.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Satisfied with Sudanese Government's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Thursday
expressed satisfaction with the Sudanese government's decision on
cease-fire in all combat zones in the south.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the league hailed the decision as "a
positive response" to appeals by specialized agencies of the
United Nations for facilitating relief operations in southern
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army has been fighting
since 1983 for increased autonomy for the predominantly Christian
and animist south from the Muslim government.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have held several rounds of talks under the
auspices of the East African Inter-Governmental Authority on
Development to seek peaceful solution to the civil war. But little
progress has been made. Nearly 2 million people have died in the
war and related famine.
</P>
<P>
The 22-nation pan Arab forum said in the statement that Sudan's
decision was made in a bid to stem bloodshed and create a climate
for national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated its stance on maintaining Sudan's territorial
integrity and warned that any attempt to disrupt security and
stability in Sudan would be targeting Arab national security.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government declared on August 5 the unilateral
cease-fire to facilitate the flow of relief aid in the south and
called on a rebel movement to reciprocate by a similar move to
help end the suffering of the people.

<HEADLINE> Barak Thanks Cyprus for Pardoning Israeli Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Thursday expressed his appreciation on Cyprus for its
pardoning of two Israelis who had been given jail terms on spy
charges.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by Barak's office, the prime minister
said that the act, carried out by Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides at the recommendation of the Cypriot general prosecutor,
is greatly appreciated by the Israeli public.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that the act will promote the good neighborly
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two Israelis were arrested near a military camp in
southern Cyprus last November at a time when Cyprus was to deploy
a battery of Russian S-300 missiles in the region.
</P>
<P>
They had pleaded guilty to a charge of approaching the
prohibited military area and were sentenced to three years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
They were also given a concurrent jail term of six months for
possessing wireless scanning equipment without a license.
</P>
<P>
Israel has admitted the two were agents from its Mossad
intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
Their pardons approved by Clerides were "based on the national
interest of Cyprus. The continuing detention of the two men would
no longer serve the national interest," a statement issued by
Cypriot government said.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government also called it a friendly gesture to
Israeli Barak assuming office last month.

<HEADLINE> EU Hails Anniversary of Geneva Conventions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union hailed on
Thursday the importance of the four Geneva Conventions concerning
human rights in armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued on the 50th anniversary of the
adoption of the four Geneva Conventions, the 15-nation bloc
stressed the primary importance of the conventions that have
served as the basic treaties of international humanitarian laws.
</P>
<P>
"The anniversary of the four Geneva Conventions is a time to
take stock and to promote the implementation of international
humanitarian law in all armed conflicts," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The union said that the conventions are as necessary today as
they were 50 years ago and it stressed full compliance with the
provisions of the conventions.
</P>
<P>
The EU statement described the conventions as being drawn up
solely for the protection of the individual in times of armed
conflicts and it called upon all countries that have not yet done
so to become a party of the conventions.
</P>
<P>
Though it recognized the achievements since the adoption of the
Geneva Conventions, the European Union deplored the persistent
violations of humanitarian laws during armed conflicts and said
that distinctions between combatants and civilians in today's
conflicts were often blurred and that children and other
vulnerable groups had become targets of conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"Bridging the widening gap between existing international norms
and respect for them should be the main objective and the issue
should be put more forcefully on the agenda of the international
community," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The union also praised the working of the International
Committee of the Red Cross and reaffirmed its support to the
humanitarian organization and its affiliated institutions
worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Prince's Bodyguard Detained in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A bodyguard of a Saudi prince was
detained Thursday in Egypt on a charge of assaulting an Egyptian
police officer, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The bodyguard, Farras Ahmad Tayyar, a Syrian national, is one
of the seven members of the entourage of Prince Turki bin Abdel
Aziz. Egypt has ordered the prince to remain in the country
pending the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Prosecutor General Maher Abdel-Wahed is investigating a
complaint by police officer Imad-Eddine Abaza that the prince's
son, two brothers-in-law, a friend and four bodyguards assaulted
him in a cafeteria of Ramsis Hilton hotel in Cairo in June. The
prince's son has not been forbidden to leave Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor ordered that Tayyar be detained for four days
for interrogation, a source at the Interior Ministry told the news
agency.
</P>
<P>
There have been complaints against Prince Turki's family and
his bodyguards since they moved into the upper floors of the hotel
in 1983 after he fell out with his brother, King Fahd.
</P>
<P>
Former employees have accused Turki of mistreatment and
withholding pay. In 1997, one of the prince's American bodyguards
was arrested for punching two men who objected to his blocking a
Cairo street with his car. Three other bodyguards were deported
after similar complaints.

UNITED NATIONS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Thursday called on donors to make a special effort
to help the victims of conflicts and natural disasters in Africa
as the continent's needs have not been met.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued through his spokesman, Annan said the
needs "are nearing irrevocable crisis proportions".

The response to the aid requests has been poor with only 352
million U.S. dollars received by U.N. humanitarian agencies so far
this year against 796 million dollars requested, he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said serious humanitarian needs cannot be met in
countries like Angola, Somalia, the Republic of Congo, Burundi,
Guinea Bissau, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Ethiopia and Eritrea due to inadequate donor response.
</P>
<P>
"The latter five countries have recently taken important steps
towards establishing peace, These advances are tenuous and must be
bolstered by the provision of aid," the U.N. chief said.

BRUSSELS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union urged on
Thursday Pakistan and India to restrain from further incidents of
airborne conflicts.

<P>
The 15-nation bloc described the already tense relations

regional peace and stability".
</P>
<P>
"Incidents during the last 48 hours have caused an increase of

<P>
In a second incident in two days of airborne conflict along the
border of Pakistan and India on Wednesday, Pakistan fired at some
Indian military jets and helicopters flying over the crash site of
a Pakistani naval reconnaisance plane that was shot down by India
a day earlier, killing all 16 people on board.
</P>
<P>
The union called for Pakistan and India to show utmost
restraint and responsibility in reacting to these incidents.
</P>
<P>
The union urged the two countries to resume talks as soon as
possible and resolve their differences in a peaceful manner in the
spirit of the Lahore declaration.
</P>
<P>
Though no one was killed or injured in Wednesday's incident,
analysts here feared that the incidents would further strain the
relations between the two countries and led them into another
round of arms race.

WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States hopes it
can make progress on arms control talks with Russia, the White
House announced.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman David Leavy told reporters that National
Security Council Advisor Sandy Berger spoke with Russia's new
premier, Vladimir Putin over telephone for about 20 minutes
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Berger stressed the importance of making progress on a
whole range of issues including arms control, nonproliferation and
economics," Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton
agreed in Cologne, Germany in June that they would give a new push
to a START III treaty.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Putin reaffirmed Russia's desire to strengthen the overall
relationship and cooperation and expressed that the new government
intends to follow the Yeltsin-Clinton agenda that was put forth in
Cologne earlier this year," Leavy added.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the U.S. last month, Putin's predecessor,
Sergei Stepashin agreed with U.S. Vice President Al Gore that
Russia and the United States will start talks on arms control this
month.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, Yeltsin fired Stepashin and chose Putin as the
new premier and a presidential candidate.

<HEADLINE> No New Timetable for Wye Accord: Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- No new timetable has been concluded
so far for implementing the Wye Accord, Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks at a joint press conference with
visiting Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Raouf al-Rawabdeh at the
PNA headquarters in Ramallah, according to a report available here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was quoted as saying the timetable demanded by the PNA
was the one agreed upon in the accord signed last October in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye Accord, Israeli should have pulled out its troops
from another 13.1 percent of the West Bank by the end of last
January. Israel suspended the accord in early December only after
withdrawing from 2 percent of the land.
</P>
<P>
The PNA chairman also stressed the Palestinian stand on the
statehood with Jerusalem as the capital. The Palestinians
postponed a decision on the establishment of an independent state
before the May 17 Israeli general elections.
</P>
<P>
On his part, al-Rawabdeh asserted his country's support to the
Palestinian people for achieving their full rights, including an
independent state with Jerusalem as the capital. Israel has claimed
Jerusalem as its undivided and eternal capital.
</P>
<P>
Al-Rawabdeh has gone back home after a brief visit to the
Palestinian territories where he had talks with Arafat on
developments of the Mideast peace process and means to revive
it.

<HEADLINE> African States Urged to Protect Children's Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Ugandan women
official Thursday called on African governments to attach more
importance to children issues, especially their rights and
welfare.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Ethiopian capital Addis
Ababa, visiting Ugandan Minister for Gender, Labor and Social
Development Janat Mukwaya said that the situation of children in
the African region, especially in warring countries, are very bad.
</P>
<P>
Some countries tend to put children's issue at the back of law,
Mukwaya said, adding that "Children's issue must be handled with
delicacy."
</P>
<P>
The minster urged African countries to ratify Africa Charter on
the Rights and Welfare of the Child, a document designed to make a
framework for protection of children in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The charter was adopted by the 26th Ordinary Session of the
Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) in Addis Ababa in July 1990.
</P>
<P>
Mukwaya is here to chair a two-day meeting of the Special
Committee on Children in Situations of Armed Conflict.
</P>
<P>
The special committee, established during the Conference on
Children in Situations of Armed Conflict held in Addis Ababa in
July 1997, consists of representatives of OAU member states,
international organizations and non-government organizations.
</P>
<P>
During its 3rd meeting beginning Wednesday, the special
committee focused on ratification of the Africa Charter on the
Rights and Welfare of the Child by member states and its coming
into force.
</P>
<P>
The committee noted that out of the minimum 15 ratifications
required to bring the charter into force, 13 ratifications have
been deposited at the OAU headquarters.
</P>
<P>
It hoped that the additional ratification will be deposited in
the very near future. It appeals to all African states which have
not done so to ratify the charter and bring it into force.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agency Reveals Growing Child Mortality in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Child Mortality in
heavily populated parts of Iraq has grown over twice since 1991,
after the United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq, the U.N.
Children's Fund (UNICEF) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the nine-year period, under-five mortality more than
doubled from 56 deaths per 1000 live births to 131 deaths per 1000
live births in south and central Iraq where 85 percent of the
country's population live, the agency said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The findings in the first UNICEF survey in Iraq reveal an
ongoing humanitarian emergency, UNICEF Executive Director Carol
Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever sanctions are imposed they should be designed and
implemented in such a way as to avoid a negative impact on
children," she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF called on the international community to provide
additional funding for humanitarian efforts in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Value-Added Tax to Facilitate Rwanda's Tax Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Value-Added Tax (VAT), due to
replace sales tax by the year 2000, is set to facilitate Rwanda`s
tax reform policy within the next millennium, the Rwanda Revenue
Authority (RRA) said in Kigali Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Henry Kanyesiime Gaperi, deputy-coordinator of VAT at the RRA,
explained that sales tax is the tax levied on the supply of goods
and services. VAT is also levied on the importation of services in
certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The Rwanda News Agency quoted Gaperi as saying that the merits
of operating a VAT system far outweigh the demerits.
</P>
<P>
The tax reform policy will be facilitated by introducing VAT
coupled with the abolition of sales tax and the adjustment of
other taxes such as excise tax.
</P>
<P>
"The major ones, however, are the need for increased and
reliable tax revenues to enable the government to perform its
duties honorably, to boost economic growth, competitiveness and
the government's determination to have a fairer tax system," said
Appolinaire Murangira, tax commissioner at the RRA.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the VAT system eliminates cascading through the
credit mechanism to the relief of both traders and consumers,
promotes exports since it zero-rates the exports.
</P>
<P>
Under the same system, there is an automatic credit, Murangira
explained.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that VAT may be inflationary, complicated to
compute and also reduces demand for certain commodities.
</P>
<P>
The business people who have grown jittery about its
implementation said that it is difficult to administer VAT as
keeping records is not simple and is regressive.
</P>
<P>
The government of Rwanda in partnership with other
stake-holders including those in the media industry, will in the
next few months take appropriate measures to ensure that
sensitization about the introduction of VAT in the year 2000 is
carried out smoothly.

<HEADLINE> Angola's Ruling Party Mission Visits South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 12 (xinhua) -- The secretary-general of the
ruling People's Liberation Movement of Angola (MPLA) Thursday
began a visit to South Africa, in a bid to remedy the spoilt
bilateral relationship between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
According to a report published by the official news agency
Angop, during the three-day visit, Joao Lourenco and his group
will meet with South African political organizations.
</P>
<P>
Angop also said that the MPLA and the African National Congress
of South Africa (ANC), the country's ruling party, have been
maintaining working relations and friendship, which was
established during the anti-apartheid fight.
</P>
<P>
Analyst said that Lourenco's visit aims to remedy the spoilt
relationship between the two countries, which deteriorated during
the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and a
recent accusation against South Africa by the Angolan defense
minister.
</P>
<P>
The two countries held different points of view on the issue of
the civil war in Congo. Angola supported the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) military intervention while South
Africa advocated peaceful negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Defense Minister Kundy Payama in late July accused
South Africa of measuring forces with Angola in fighting for
regional leadership.
</P>
<P>
Lourenco's delegation will return to Angola Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Italy Warns KLA to Halt Anti-Serb Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini warned Kosovo Liberation Army's (KLA) guerrillas Thursday to
stop the violence against the province's remaining Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Dini denounced the KLA's failure to lay down its weapons
according to the agreed timetable and a general failure by Kosovo
Albanians to cooperate with attempts to foster co-existence
between Serbs and Albanians, Italian news agency Ansa reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He spoke of his "deep concern over the failure of Kosovo
Albanians to comply with the international community's requests,
as well as over the ongoing incidents against the Serb population
and the continuing exodus of Serbs from Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"If violence attributable to the KLA and/or deviant groups
should continue, the international community will be forced to
reconsider reconstruction aid for Kosovo," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dini's warning came a day after UNHCR, the United Nations'
refugee agency, declared that worsening violence against Serb
residents of the Kosovo capital Pristina had reduced their numbers
from 20,000 to less than 2,000.
</P>
<P>
Two women, aged 70 and 79, were shot in their homes on Monday
night as part of a growing tide of violence aimed at driving the
last Serbs out of the ethnically Albanian province, UNHCR said.
</P>
<P>
Last week the Kosovo international peace-keeping force (KFOR)
reported nine murders and seven serious attacks in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
The situation required KFOR to intervene "with greater vigor"
to prevent violence against Serbs, Dini said.
</P>
<P>
He reminded the KLA, which some say has lost control of fringe
sections, that a United Nations Security Council resolution called
for a multi-ethnic Kosovo with broad autonomy from Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Agriculture Grows 6.76 Pct in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The agriculture sector of the
Philippines posted a robust 6.76 percent growth in the first half
of the year, Agriculture Secretary Edgardo Angara said Thursday in
a report.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, gross earnings of the agricultural
products in the first semester stood at 286.4 billion pesos (7.16
billion U.S. dollars), 16.03 percent higher than the same period
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report said the crops subsector increased by 12.53 percent
in output and it was nearing its 1997 level.
</P>
<P>
In the second place was the livestock subsector with an
increase rate of 5.86 percent. All the subsector's components
outdid their previous year's production performance.
</P>
<P>
The fishery subsector managed to expand by 1.18 percent buoyed
up by the noticeable output gains in commercial and municipal
fishing.
</P>
<P>
However, the poultry subsector failed to sustain its 1998
record as aggregate output dropped by 2.85 percent, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
On the average, prices received by farmers moved up by 8.96
percent from the 1998 levels. The biggest average price increase
of 11.14 percent was noted in the crops subsector, followed by
poultry subsector's 3.39 percent and livestock subsector's 2.60
percent.

<HEADLINE> HK Electric Reports 1.5 Pct Profit Increase in Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Electric Holding
Limited announced Thursday that its unaudited consolidated profits
amounted to 1,937 million HK dollars (251 million U.S. dollars) in
the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the 1,909 million HK dollars (244.7 million U.S.
dollars) profit of the corresponding period of last year, the
figure represents an increase of 1.5 percent, according to the
1999 interim report of the group.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the relatively cooler weather experienced in May
and June 1999, the overall level of sales during the first half of
1999 is in line with the group's expectations," said George C.
Magnus, chairman of the group.
</P>
<P>
The group also witnessed a slight increase in turnover to 4,038
million HK dollars (517.7 million U.S. dollars) from 4,034 million
HK dollars (517.2 million U.S. dollars) in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the profit increase to the group's continuous
efforts on cost control and on providing reliable, environmentally
friendly electricity and excellent customer service.
</P>
<P>
All pledged service standards were either achieved or surpassed
during the period, and the high standard of environmental
protection continues to be improved, he said.

<HEADLINE> The Truth Has Come Out: People's Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, will carry a commentary tomorrow, titled "the
Truth Has Come Out," along with a full examination of Falun Gong
leader Li Hongzhi's role in the April 25 illegal gathering at
Zhongnanhai, in a further expose of the outlawed sect.
</P>
<P>
Evidence shows that the illegal gathering was a well-prepared
and well-organized major political incident aimed at exerting
pressure on the Communist Party of China and the central
government, and disrupting the country's stable political
situation, the commentator says.
</P>
<P>
From this incident, people can get a further glimpse of the
true face of Li and the sect's ulterior political motives. His
sophistry and denials will be to no avail, it says.
</P>
<P>
Li has said that he knew nothing about the gathering, but there
is evidence that he was its mastermind, organizer and director,
the commentary points out.
</P>
<P>
Li has also said that he is not interested in politics. But the
fact is that he often agitated practitioners to put pressure on
the government and the media.
</P>
<P>
Li once declared that Falun Gong had no organization. But facts
show that it has a strict organizational system, according to the
commentary.
</P>
<P>
His fallacies reveal the sect's true nature of being anti-
science, anti-human, anti-society, and anti-government, the
commentary says. It concludes that continuous efforts are needed
to carry the struggle against the illegal Falun Gong cult through
to the end.

<HEADLINE> Signing of SADC Trade Protocol Slow: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean minister said
Thursday he is concerned at the slow pace by which member states
are moving to ratify the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) Trade Protocol.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for a third of the member states to ratify the
protocol in Maputo next week at the SADC summit," Industry and
Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira said.
</P>
<P>
He said if the protocol was ratified it would come into
existence next January.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was critical for the region as it would see the
movement of goods in the region.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Shamuyarira said there were plans by
South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe for a joint project to build
a steel mill in the Beira corridor.
</P>
<P>
The project was aimed at supplying the South East Asian region
with steel products in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
"The plans are still at their infancy for us to make a full
statement," Shamuyarira said.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a general agreement that we should produce for
this market," he said, adding the estimated cost of the project
was 850 million Zimbabwean dollars (22.3 million U.S. dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Zhonghua (China) Association in
Zimbabwe has strongly condemned Lee Teng-hui's remarks on "two
Chinas", described it as neglecting historical facts.
</P>
<P>
Yu Jiaxiang, President of Zhonghua Association in Zimbabwe made
the blast in a statement issued here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Lee Teng-hui's "two Chinas" remarks have
been condemned by all Chinese people, many countries in the world
as well as the Chinese in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
It is well-known that Taiwan has always been part of Chinese
territory, and the majority of the countries in the world
recognized the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate
government of China, the association said.
</P>
<P>
"Zhonghua Association strongly opposes Lee Teng-Hui's attempt
of neglecting historical facts and breaking away from China," it
added.
</P>
<P>
The association called on Lee Teng-hui to abandon his stand and
come back to the stand of recognizing the "one China" formula and
resuming talks between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits so that
the unification of the motherland will be achieved as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"This is the common will of Chinese people all over the world,"
it noted.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Nears Final Arms Deal With Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government will consider final decisions on a 30-billion-rand
(five billion U.S. dollars) arms deal with foreign suppliers
within two to three weeks, a defense official has said.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet would make final decisions on the deals that have
been initiated with individual providers based on whether it can
afford the purchases, said Chippy Shaikh, chief of acquisitions at
the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
The proposed purchases provided for offset investments, or
industrial participation, of about 110 billion rand (18.3 billion
dollars) in South African industry.
</P>
<P>
"We're still busy with" the affordability investigation,
Associated Press (AP) Thursday quoted Shaikh as saying. "You can
give me the best offset program and the best price structure, but
the issue of affordability is something different."
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government gave preliminary approval to a
defense package that included 28 Gripen jet fighters from
Saab/British Aerospace of Sweden and England -- the most
expensive item estimated to cost 10.9 billion rand (1.8 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The proposed deal also included the purchase of three
submarines and four corvette warships from Germany, 40 light
utility helicopters from Italy and 24 Hawk-100 jet trainers from
British Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's chief arms negotiator Jayendra Naidoo Thursday
denied a report that the Gripen fighters deal has been closed.
</P>
<P>
"It's complete nonsense, even the amount involved is completely
wrong," Naidoo said.

<HEADLINE> Angola Denies Animosity Against S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Angola, with an eye on the
position of the Executive Secretary of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC), rejected the existence of any
animosity between Angola and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Every country has its own points of view on determined
questions," said Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Miranda, "so we
cannot expect that Angola and South Africa have always the same
points of view on international or regional issues."
</P>
<P>
He added that due to different internal and international
problems they face, it is "normal" that there exist "divergences"
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Miranda told the Angolan Public Television that "South Africa
is of great potential in the future of the continent."
</P>
<P>
He also said that during the fights for liberation from the
Apartheid, SADC member countries have established fraternal
relations, without mentioning a recent accusation against South
Africa by the Angolan defense minister.
</P>
<P>
On July 30, Angolan Defense Minister Kundy Payama accused South
Africa of measuring forces with Angola and regarding Luanda as a
main rival in its fight for the leadership in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Having an eye to the post of the Executive Secretary of the
SADC, Angola tried to improve its relations with SADC member
countries, especially with South Africa, which is taking the
rotating three-year presidency of the summit of SADC.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Secretary of SADC will be appointed at the SADC
summit according to the recommendation of SADC's Council of
Ministers, which is holding a meeting in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Miranda said that during the summit, which is set to be held in
 Mozambique next Wednesday, Angola will try to obtain the post of
the Executive Secretary, saying that "the candidate in favor of
Angola has been launched and we will defend it."

<HEADLINE> S. African FM Optimistic About Congo Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Nkosazana Zuma, returning from a trip to the war-torn
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), said Thursday that she was
optimistic about finding a final solution to the conflicts there.
</P>
<P>
"Every war must end. I'm still positive that a solution will be
found. It is up to all of us, especially the Congolese, to find
one," she told reporters at Waterkloof air base outside Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
But she acknowledged that her trip did not yield any
conclusion, saying that it would be premature to predict the
DPA339HAB233I12TEQL01:0301:032731
outcome of efforts to determine who was the legitimate leader of
the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), the main rebel group in
the Congo.
</P>
<P>
The two-day visit produced much information about a rebel
leadership dispute in the Congo, she said.
</P>
<P>
"We collected a lot of information and documentation... and
will look at that. It would be premature at this stage to make
any predictions," she said.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the RCD leadership is at the center of a delay
in putting into action a peace accord concluded last month between
the main players in the Congo conflict.
</P>
<P>
Opposing factions in the rebel group are at odds over who
should sign the agreement on behalf of the RCD.
</P>
<P>
Ousted RCD leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba insists this is his
prerogative.
</P>
<P>
But his Rwanda-backed rivals, led by Emile Illunga, say that
Wamba has no troops or political following. They accuse him of
being a mere puppet of the Ugandans who support him.
</P>
<P>
Zuma left Tuesday for the northeastern town of Kisangani in
Congo which has been split in two by the fighting RCD factions.
She was accompanied by the legal adviser to President Thabo Mbeki,
Mojankunyane Gumbi, and state security officials.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said her delegation, along with Zambian Minister for
Presidential Affairs Eric Silwamba, met both RCD groups.
</P>
<P>
"Our main mandate was to verify who is their real leader who
should sign. We listened to both sides and collected a lot of
documentation from them," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Together with the Zambian minister who is leading the process,
we will produce some kind of report and present it to the heads of
state."
</P>
<P>
Her visit to the Congo came after a meeting in Pretoria Sunday
between Mbeki and Presidents Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda, Yoweri
Museveni of Uganda and Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Both the Rwandan and Ugandan heads of state, who had been
backing rebels fighting to topple Congolese President Laurent
Kabila, endorsed last month' s peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for a cease-fire, the creation of a united
army after a 90-day dialog on the Congo's political future, and
for international peace-keepers to monitor compliance.
</P>
<P>
It was also signed by Kabila and his military allies,
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, Namibian President Sam Nujoma
and the Angolan defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Zuma could not say when a report on the rebel leadership
dispute would be handed to the heads of state concerned,
explaining this was up to the Zambians leading the verification
process.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said that the weekend fighting in Kisangani between the
RCD factions had subsided by the time she arrived.
</P>
<P>
She declined to convey any impressions on who was in control of
 Kisangani, saying: "I have my own ideas, but I don't think I want
to share them right now."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the likelihood of a reconciliation between the two
RCD factions, she said only time would tell.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to see what happens when the report is ready. I
don't think this is a matter that could be dealt with purely at a
technical level. You still have to deal with the reality."
</P>
<P>
Zuma expressed optimism that the Congo peace accord would get
off the ground.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian-Saudi Joint Committee to Meet in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Saudi Arabia will hold
the ninth session of their joint committee in October to seek ways
for further cooperation in political, economic and cultural
fields, an Egyptian diplomatic source said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will examine the necessary steps to enhance
economic relationship and bilateral trade, including the
establishment of a joint free trade zone, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is the largest Arab investor in Egypt. It has
invested 2.94 billion U.S. dollars in Egypt so far in areas
including tourism, real estate, industry and agriculture, which
accounts for 40 percent of the total Arab investments.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade reached 933.33 million dollars in 1997, with
Egypt having 115.73 million dollars in surplus. The two sides
initialed an agreement in November, which calls for setting up a
free trade zone by 2004.
</P>
<P>
The joint committee will also discuss the latest developments
in the Middle East peace process and regional and international
situation, and ways of pursuing Arab joint actions, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
The joint committee will convene in Cairo in the second half of
October under Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and his Saudi
counterpart Saud al-Faisal.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Saudi Arabia enjoy good political relations and
maintain regular coordination and consultations on key issues in
the Gulf region, the Arab world and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The eighth session of the Egyptian-Saudi Joint Committee was
convened in Riyadh on June 22 last year.

<HEADLINE> Agro Export Earnings Fall in Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Sugar, cotton and rubber
export earnings estimatedly fell 6 percent or 4.6 billion U.S.
dollars in developing countries in 1998, according to a Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Changes in weather and economic conditions contributed to the
fall, said FAO in its 1998-1999 commodity Market Review.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations agency found that food import bills of the
least developed and net food importing developing countries rose
in the mid-1990s due partly to the generally higher prices for
cereals and to lower volumes of food aid and subsidized exports.
</P>
<P>
FAO found little evidence of any significant change in world
price instability, either year-to-year or within year, following
the conclusion of the Uruguay Round.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Refugees May Stay in Britain With Friends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Home Office Thursday
allowed the single largest group of illegal immigrants caught in
the country to stay with friends and relatives while their cases
are processed.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office, or the interior ministry, said it believed the
117 people claiming to be Kosovo Albanians had arrived in
southeast England in a lorry.
</P>
<P>
But they were rounded up by police on early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Members of the group, including 36 children, have been
finger-printed and photographed by officials, said a Home office
spokesman who refused to say whether the refugees were seeking
political asylum.
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Kent, southern England, said all of those caught
had left the temporary accommodation offered to them as most of
them had relatives or other close contacts in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Britain took in hundreds of Kosovo refugees during NATO's air
war against Yugoslavia. Many of them have started to return to
their homeland.

<HEADLINE> More Companies Recruit Directors From Outside Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Companies have increasingly
been recruiting directors from their base countries, indicating
the globalization of corporate boards, the Conference Board, a
U.S. prominent research group, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said in a 16-nation report that the
percentage of companies with "non-national" directors increased
from 39 percent in 1995 to 60 percent in 1998. The 16 nations
surveyed are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France,
Germany, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Singapore, South Africa,
Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"High level of cross-border direct investment and the
accelerating trend to raise capital from foreign investors have
forced companies to disclose vastly improved financial and
corporate information, open their communications, and redefine
their corporate culture, role and structure," said the report
authors, Lucy Alexander, a London-based research associate in the
Conference Borad's Global Corporate Governance Research Center,
and Sigrid Esser, associate director of the center.
</P>
<P>
The report said company boards are adding "non-national"
members to help gain credibility in new market and "non-nationals"
add specific expertise to help deal with the opportunities and
risks of untried market. Other factors in recruiting non-national
directors, particularly in Latin America where corporate
governance is in more of a developmental stage, include helping to
professionalize the board by providing a global, independent
focus, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the globalizing boards to changes in the
business environment, changes in the business culture and
increases in cross-border long-term investment. Cross-border M&AMP;A
transactions increased from 85 billion U.S. dollars in 1991 to 342
billion dollars in 1997, accounting for 58 percent of total
foreign direct investment flows, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report also said about 14 percent of total pro-tax profits
of U.S. corporations is generated by direct investments abroad.
From 1994 to 1997, the stock of U.S. direct investment abroad
increased by 40 percent to 350 billion dollars, amounting to 4.7
percent of the U.S. gross domestic product, it said.

<HEADLINE> Africa Only Gets Less Than Half Needed Aid, U.N. Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Thursday issued an urgent appeal for more aid for Africa, saying
that the gap exceeds more than 50 percent of needed aid.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Vieira de Mello, U.N. undersecretary-general for
humanitarian affairs, told a press conference here, "As of July 1,
the shortfall for humanitarian appeals in Africa was over 50
percent of what had been appealed for from donors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 14.5 million U.S. dollars needed for the Republic of
Congo, also involved in a civil war, not a single dollar had been
received.
</P>
<P>
Only 352 million U.S. dollars had so far been received out of
795 million U.S. dollars needed this year to assist more than 12
million needy people on the African continent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the shortfall in contributions from traditional
donor countries, "humanitarian programs have had to be cut back
and even life-saving assistance in many instances is not being
provided where it is urgently required," U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Among the countries where urgent needs could not be met, the
spokesman listed Angola, Somalia, the Republic of Congo, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra
Leone, Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Supplies were simply insufficient to assist 2 million people in
Angola affected by fighting between the government and the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general did say 200 people are dying daily
nationwide" in Angola, de Mello said, referring to the fact that
fighting has made it hard for humanitarian aid to reach needy
people in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
In southern and central Somalia, at least 1 million people were
threatened with famine as a result of persistent conflict, six
consecutive poor harvests and grim prospects for the latest one.
</P>
<P>
"In the developed world, many countries are experiencing
unprecedented economic growth and robust budget surpluses. Yet
international aid budgets continue to stagnate or decline," said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary-General was "alarmed by the poor response of
the international community" and contrasted this with what it
called unprecedented economic growth and robust budget surpluses
in many developed nations, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general appeals to donors to make a special
effort now to help the victims of conflicts and natural disasters
in Africa," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Loses $1 Billion for Unrest in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has lost one billion U.S.
dollars this year in the disruption of oil production by restive
youth in its oil rich Niger delta, oil producers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued after closed-door meeting with the head
of the country's oil corporation, the companies said this excluded
losses from " threat to lives, hostages taking and damage to
facilities."
</P>
<P>
The oil rich delta, hub of the country's oil industry, has
recently become the scene of violent protests, kidnappings, and
takeover of oil installations by the major ethnic groups in the
area protesting against the absence of infrastructure and youth
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the largest of the six oil companies operating in the
area, the Anglo-Dutch company Shell said such disruption has
forced it to operate at 25 percent of its capacity.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's meeting in the Nigerian capital between the
country's Chamber of Commerce and the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation was intended to review the situation and develop
strategies for engaging communities in oil producing areas.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agreed to adopt a common approach "toward the
sustainable economic growth of oil producing communities," whose
neglect is a cause behind current agitations on the area.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, attended by the six major oil companies operating
in the country, agreed on the establishment of additional youth
development programs to enable the youths, who are behind the
agitations to become employable.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to address all ethnic problems,
border and inter-tribal disputes, which has exacerbated the
agitations in the region which accounts for most of the country's
oil income.
</P>
<P>
They also resolved to meet "periodically" with the respective
governors of oil producing states to agree on "programs for
expeditious resolution of problems in the area."

LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- European stocks posted steep
gains for the second straight day Thursday, as investors flocked
into markets amid subsiding fears over the outlook for higher U.S.
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
London's benchmark FTSE 100 swept to a 2.31 percent higher
close at 6,142.5, a gain of 138.9 points, propelled by an early

</P>
<P>
Together with Wednesday's 36-point gain, the FTSE blue chips
have wiped out their 148-point loss from Tuesday's sessions.
</P>
<P>
The new optimism made telecoms look more attractive to UK
investors and the sector rose by 3.5 percent. Telewest
Communications added 16p, or 7.1 percent, to 240.25p.
</P>
<P>
Banks also did well, rising 3 percent. Royal Bank of Scotland
shares closed up 48p at 1,199p. HSBC gained 31p to 746.5, Halifax
jumped 14p to 662p, Barclays put on 50p to 1,779p and Lloyds TSB

<HEADLINE> Kenya Reopens its Border with Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has reopened its border
with Somalia because calm has returned on the other side of the
border, a local source said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The border closed early July on the heels of an incident where
a band of Somali militiamen attacked a Kenya army platoon in the
border area in North Eastern Province and snatched two army
lorries, firearms and radio equipment, which were later returned
to the Kenya army.
</P>
<P>
North Eastern Provincial Commissioner Maurice Makhanu said in
his office Thursday that vehicles and nationals of the two
countries were now free to cross the border.
</P>
<P>
However, military personnel at the border would remain to
conduct security surveillance as the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees was allowed to ferry refugees at the border to the three
camps in the province, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police in Garissa District in the province Thursday
gunned down a bandit at the Iffo Refugee Camp and recovered an
AK-47 assault rifle,
</P>
<P>
a bayonet and several round of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Garissa District Commissioner Salim Ali Mola confirmed the
incident, saying the bandit was in a group which earlier killed a
World Food Program lorry turn boy they had attacked.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says India, Pakistan Ignore its Appeal for Restraint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States Thursday
expressed disappointment over the ignorance by India and Pakistan
of the U.S. appeal to abide by a 1991 agreement designed to avert
military clashes between them.
</P>
<P>
"We have been talking to them about it, and urging that they do
so," State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters at a
briefing. "I don't have any confirmation that both parties have
indicated that they will do so."
</P>
<P>
The 1991 agreement forbids aircraft from flying within about 10
km of the Indian-Pakistani border without advance notice. It also
calls for a prompt investigation in the event of a violation and
use of telephone hot lines during emergencies.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department Wednesday called upon the two
countries to abide by the agreement and urged both parties to
restrain themselves and resolve differences through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The tension has been growing in the subcontinent since India
shot down a Pakistani plane near the border Tuesday. Pakistan
accused India of "cold-blooded murder" while India alleged the
plane was shot down because it invaded its airspace.
</P>
<P>
The downing of the plane led to Pakistani troops firing a
surface-to-air missile Wednesday at an Indian military jet along
the countries' disputed border. Pakistani officials said the
Indian jets had invaded its airspace.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls For Using Cleaner Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
called here Thursday for research and development of biomass
technology to convert plants and trees into fuel so as to address
global warming in next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Clinton issued an executive order establishing a council to
coordinate the federal government's effort to develop a biomass
research program, and setting a goal of tripling use of
bioenergy and bioproducts by 2010.
</P>
<P>
It was possible to use bioenergy to help U.S. to meet economic
challenges, maintain security, sustain prosperity and ease the
threat of global warming, the president said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit today to the Agriculture Department, The
president will also appeal to Congress to approve 242 million U.S.
dollars in his fiscal 2000 budget proposal for research and tax
credits to promote energy efficiency, bioenergy and other clean
energies.
</P>
<P>
The White House said the ultimate goal of Clinton's order was
to replace coal, oil, natural gas and uranium with cleaner,
renewable biomass energy. If the goal was met by 2010, annual
greenhouse gas emissions would drop by more than 100 million
tons, the equivalent of taking 70 million automobiles off the
nation's roads.
</P>
<P>
If the goal was met it would also generate 15 billion U.S
dollars to 20 billion U.S dollars in income for farmers and rural
areas, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
Biomass technology uses trees, crops and waste from
agriculture or forestry to make energy that can then be used as
fuel for cars or power factories. It also can be used to create
a variety of chemicals and products from pharmaceuticals to
glue, paint or even textiles.
</P>
<P>
The executive order asks the secretaries of Agriculture and
Energy and the Administrator of of the Environmental Protection
Agency to prepare a report within 120 days on options for
increasing biomass energy use.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls World Response to Humanitarian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Anna, who was alarmed by inadequate international response to
humanitarian crisis in Africa, Thursday appealed to donor countries
to "make a special effort to help the victims of conflicts and
natural disasters in Africa."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman Fred Eckhard, Annan
said, "The humanitarian needs of victims of war and natural
disasters in many parts of Africa are nearing irrevocable crisis
proportions, and the Secretary-General is alarmed by the poor
response of the international community."
</P>
<P>
"United Nations humanitarian agencies and their partners
require 796 million U.S. dollars to assist over 12 million needy
people in Africa during 1999, yet only 352 million U.S. dollars
has been received," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, humanitarian programs have had to be cut back
and even life saving assistance in many instances is not being
provided where it is urgently required," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Angola, it is estimated that 200 lives are being lost each
day as the conflict between the Angolan Government and the rebel
National Union for the total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
forces intensifies, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In southern and central Somalia, a combination of persistent
conflict, grim prospects for the current harvest and the
cumulative effect of six consecutive poor yields are threatening
at least one million people with famine, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"In the Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra
Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as in Ethiopia
and Eritrea there are also serious humanitarian needs that
cannot be met due to inadequate donor response," the statement
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns Indonesian Officials Against "Intimidation" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Thursday described as "intimidation"
Indonesia's prediction of violence on the day when residents of
East Timor vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
"This is intimidation, or worse. It is unacceptable," Albright
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
She was warning "Indonesian officials and anti-independence
militia leaders who have suggested in recent days that a vote for
independence will result in extensive violence or even civil war."
</P>
<P>
She urged all parties concerned "to ensure a fair vote and to
preserve the credibility of Indonesia's own transition, that
Jakarta meet its obligation to provide a secure environment and
promote the disarmament of all paramilitary forces in East Timor."
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said Albright was
reminding "all concerned, in the strongest possible terms, that
they are obligated to respect the results of the referendum and
provide genuine security for all East Timorese."
</P>
<P>
The East Timorese will vote for independence or autonomy on
August 30. As the day for referendum is drawing nearer, conflicts
between the anti-independence militias and pro-independence
guerrillas are increasing, leading to killings of dozens of people
there.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stock End Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Thursday with the Dow Jones industrial average rising.
</P>
<P>
The Dow closed up 1.59 at 10,789.39. The blue chip index rose
as much as 113 points in the trading.
</P>
<P>
But Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 3.77 at 1,298.16 and the
technology heavy Nasdaq index fell 15.49 at 2,549.49.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's auction of 10 billion U.S. dollars in 30-year
bonds cut almost all the Dow's gain and pushed S&AMP;T and Nasdaq
lower. The move drove the bond's yield up to 6.27 percent and with
yield above 6 percent, bonds are presenting an attractive
alternative to stock investment.
</P>
<P>
The worries about higher interest rates prevailed and had an
effect on the market as the Commerce Department reported a 0.7
percent rise in retail sales in July. The Federal Reserve could
see the increase as an inflationary pressure in the U.S. economy
and therefore raise interest rates to preempt inflation.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 0.41 to 610.63 and the American
Stock Exchange index rose 3.28 at 780.65. The Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies rose 0.63 at 428.82.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues barely outnumbered advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,537 down, 1,510 up and 510 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 742.40 million shares from 782.79
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Albright Hopes Israel to Carry Out Wye Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Thursday that Israel and the Palestinians
should carry out the commitments they made in the Wye River
agreement last October.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said at a briefing that
Albright was answering a message from Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak who said disputes between the two sides were a haggling that
could only waste time.
</P>
<P>
Barak sent the message through the visiting Israeli Justice
Minister Yossi Beilin. He said precious time would be spent better
by opening negotiations on a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
But Albright told Beilin that the Israeli side should carry out
its commitment to transfer another 11 percent of the West Bank to
the Palestinian Authority under the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
This could be done while also accelerating talks on an overall
settlement, Albright told Beilin, according to Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Albright also told the justice minister that the Clinton
administration would have no problem with "modest adjustments" in
the time frame for the Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank,
Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Israel has implemented the first stage of the Wye River
agreement by relinquishing 2 percent of the West Bank. The
remaining of the 11 percent should be carried out in the second
and third stages. But it was suspended by former Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu late last year.
</P>
<P>
Barak, after assuming office, has pledged to carry out the rest
of the pullback, but he hoped the implementation of the Wye
agreement would be combined with the final status negotiations,
which was rejected by the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
Barak later agreed to carry out the accord by withdrawing the
Israeli troops at the beginning of October and completed the
pullback until next year. The Palestinians grumbled about the
stretched out schedule.
</P>
<P>
Albright is likely to work on the timetable for the pullback
and also help set a date for negotiations on final status
negotiations when she makes a trip to the region due to begin on
September 1.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Eddie Irvine has said he will
leave the Ferrari team next season unless he and Michael
Schumacher are treated as equals.
</P>
<P>
With Schumacher injured, the 33-year-old Ulsterman has revelled
in his new status as number one driver with Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
He has won the last two Grand Prix to put him eight points
clear of the reigning champion, Mika Hakkinen, with six races to
go.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher broke his leg in the British Grand Prix at
Silverstone last month.
</P>
<P>
When he was asked by an Italian magazine if he was staying with
Ferrari, Irvine answered:
</P>
<P>
"That depends. If Schumacher does not return as number one, I
will stay.
</P>
<P>
"If on his return, he is again first driver, I will leave."
</P>
<P>
Irvine paid tribute to his German team-mate, declaring that he
was a faster driver: "In identical cars nobody can beat him."
</P>
<P>
But he added: "He makes too many mistakes. He has to stop
making errors."
</P>
<P>
Irvine is looking for his third win in a row in the Hungarian
Grand Prix on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The pressure is building up as he attempts to secure Ferrari's
first championship since Jody Scheckter 20 years ago.

ZAGREB, August 12 (Xinhua) -- World championships double gold
medalist Dmitry Sautin of Russia was beaten to second by China's
Peng Bo at the Military World Games here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sautin, also defending champion at the Military World Games,
scored only 633.12 points in three meters springboard, nearly 20
points below Peng.
</P>
<P>
"I was really lucky today," said Peng. "Maybe Sautin was not
accustomed to the colder temperature here. Or he may be too
relaxed as China's top divers did not compete here."
</P>
<P>
Peng said he did not perform well in his last dive and thought
the gold could be gone. But Sautin also failed in his dive to let
Peng win.
</P>
<P>
The bronze medal went to China's Liu Junhong, who collected 632.
04 points.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Liu Hengning said Peng was a good all-round diver
which can compete in all three events and had promising prospect.

<HEADLINE> Keane Facing Contract D-Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United captain Roy
Keane must make the biggest decision of his career in the next 48
hours amid growing fears that he may turn his back on the club.
</P>
<P>
The United skipper will tell the club by Saturday if he will
accept their final new contract offer.
</P>
<P>
The deal on the table is reportedly worth 30,000 pounds-a-week,
which is 10,000-a-week less than what he is said to want.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Ireland midfielder turned 28 on Tuesday and he
is determined to do as well as he can from his last big pay day.
</P>
<P>
He has spent the last few days mulling over the offer and if he
says no, it will herald the end of his United career.
</P>
<P>
Keane could then see out the remainder of his contract and then
leave on a free transfer in the summer under the Bosman ruling.
</P>
<P>
He knows that if he did go abroad to Spain or Italy he could
virtually write his own contract and at least double what United
are offering him.
</P>
<P>
Keane said at the start of the week: "It isn't an easy decision
for me to make.
</P>
<P>
"I have to take a lot of things into consideration with it
being my last contract."
</P>
<P>
United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has had several conversations
with Keane in an attempt to persuade him to stay, but he admits he
does not know if he will.
</P>
<P>
Sir Alex fears he may fancy the challenge of playing abroad. He
said: "I have had some chats with him and he's certainly undecided
when I've spoken to him."

<HEADLINE> Cuba's Sotomayor Ruled out of World Championships Roster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Cuban sports officials have kept
high jumper Javier Sotomayor, who tested positive for cocaine
earlier in the Pan American Games, from competing in the world
championships to be held in Seville, not for the doping cases, but
for an injury.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to let him compete in Seville, we are going
to keep studying him ... He needs an operation," Dr. Rodrigo
Alvarez Cambras, the head of Cuba's medical team in Winnipeg,
Canada, said on state television late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez said Sotomayor suffered a back injury at the recent Pan
American Games in Winnipeg and had later been found to be also
suffering from a hernia.
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor had his four Pan Am gold medal stripped after the
positive doping test. He has denied taking drugs, claiming he was
the victim of a set-up.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Russian athletics chief Valentin Balakhnichyov
called Thursday on the International Amateur Athletic Federation
to ban Cuba's high jump world record holder.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF said they had no immediate plans to suspend Sotomayor
and first wanted the Cuban federation to make a decision on the
athlete.

WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- American Pete Sampras scored
a 7-5, 7-6 (7-2) victory over Germany's Rainer Schuttler in the
third round of the ATP Championship in Mason, Ohio on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The victory extended Sampras' streak to 19 matches, during

Sampras has dominated men's tennis - finishing No. 1 a record six

of Sampras' career.

<P>
Schuttler, 49th in ATP Tour rankings, said playing his first
match against Sampras was good experience.
</P>
<P>
Advancing to the quarter-finals with Sampras were defending
champion Patrick Rafter of Australia, who beat 15th-seeded Nicolas
Lapentti of Ecuador 6-2, 6-3; fourth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia, who edged Chris Woodruff of the United States 6-4, 6-4;
fifth-seeded Tim Henman of Britain, who ousted 12th-seeded Nicolas
Kiefer of Germany, 6-4, 6-1; and sixth-seeded Gustavo Kuerten of
Brazil, who eliminated 11th-seeded Tommy Haas of Germany 7-5, 7-5.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Increases Investment in Fujian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 13 (Xinhua) -- More and more Taiwanese
businesses are investing in this capital of Fujian Province,
facing the island province across the Taiwan Straits, hoping to
use it as a springboard to seek business opportunities in other
parts of the mainland.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Fuzhou Economic and Technical Development
Zone said that by the end of 1998, the zone had introduced 1.1
billion US dollars from Taiwan for 161 projects, accounting for 13
percent of the total Taiwan investment in Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the investment has changed from the initial labor-
intensive sector to the current technology- and capital-intensive
sectors, with many conglomerates as the investors.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Taiwan-funded enterprises in the zone realized an
industrial output valued at 10 billion yuan, with the export
volume reaching nearly 300 million US dollars, accounting for 53
percent of the total export volume by overseas-funded enterprises
in the zone.
</P>
<P>
He said that a pilot zone will be set up within the development
zone to further expand economic and trade cooperation across the
straits.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment in 1985, the development zone has
signed contracts on projects involving more than 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars of investment from overseas.

<P>
FUZHOU, August 13 (Xinhua) -- While the Chinese in the North,
especially around the capital Beijing, have been wiping the sweat
from their brows in the sauna-like heat wave, people living
farther south have enjoyed a cool summer.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, the weather began to turn hot in the capital
of the southeastern province Fujian, but several rainfalls that
followed soon expelled the heat. Residents still remember last
year's heatwave that came as early as April and hit a peak between
June and October, when temperatures hovered around 38 to 39
degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
This year's highest temperature reached 36 degree Celsius for
several days in June but by July the averaged temperature was
around 23 to 28 Celsius, as much as five degrees lower than normal.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists attribute the phenomenon to the La Nina effect
and say that Fuzhou's precipitation this summer was doubled the
normal amount while the daily amount of sunlight was only four or
five hours.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Smuggling Drive Helps Increase Revenues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, August 13 (Xinhua) --Customs officers at the port of
Fangcheng in China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region report that
they had a 99 percent rise in revenues from tariffs in the first
six months from last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
From January to June, Customs officers collected 60.03 million
yuan in tariffs, and 127 million yuan in taxes, 4.7 times last
year's figure and they attribute the increase to the more intense
efforts being used against smuggling since last August.
</P>
<P>
Fangcheng is on the Beibu Gulf where smuggling used to run
rampant. To control it, Customs officers have been cooperating
closely with local government departments, using a round-the-clock
system of supervision, intensifying patrol at docks, and strictly
scrutinizing customs forms.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months, they dealt with 71 cases of smuggling
of cigarettes, rubber, diesel oil, and other goods worth 5.31
million yuan.

<HEADLINE> China's Trade Increase Benefits Panama Canal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The increase of China's
foreign trade benefits Panama Canal and Colon Free Zone (CFZ), ex-
negotiator of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties Julio Yao said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yao said that trade expansion between Panama and China,
including Hong Kong, contributes to the development of the free
zone and the interoceanic canal, which depends on the volume of
foreign trade of Latin America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Yao noted that Panama possesses a strategic importance, which
should not be underrated for the increase of trade between Latin
America and China.
</P>
<P>
This promising panorama must be regarded as an important factor
for CFZ's growth, and it will be of benefit to Panama as well,
said the expert who also holds a chair in international law in the
University of Panama.
</P>
<P>
According to a report published recently by Panama Canal
Authority (PCA), Cosco, one of China's largest shipping firms,
occupies first place in regard to ship transit through the
interoceanic waterway.
</P>
<P>
Yao said the importance of Panama Canal in the coming century
will further grow due to the world trade expansion promoted by
globalization.
</P>
<P>
"That's why it's important for our policies to head toward a
maintenance and development of best relations with the main users
of this interoceanic pathway, among which is China," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pre-Historic Animal Fossils Found in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
found a large number of fossils of pre-historic animals in a karst
cave near the capital of Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The cave is at the village of Majizhang to the northwest of the
city. They found fossils of tigers, leopards, and deer 15 meters
below ground near the cave entrance, which are believed to be 20,
000 years old.
</P>
<P>
They also discovered fossils of squid from about 300 million
years ago on a large stone outside the cave. And there were traces
of human activities with a thick layer of ash beneath a large rock
three meters from the cave entrance.
</P>
<P>
The area may have been a forest, they say, where many animals
found a quiet place for a graveyard where bones piled up over time
and were fossilized after millions of years. The discovery is
expected to provide valuable clues to the evolution of animals.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Affairs Official Meets Reunification Alliance Group from Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Chen Yunlin, director of the
Taiwan Work Office of the Communist Party of China's Central
Committee, met here today with a visiting delegation from Taiwan's
Alliance for the Reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
Chen, also director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State
Council, said that Lee Teng-hui's "two states" remarks revealed
his political nature of undermining the "one China" principle and
attempting to separate Taiwan from China.
</P>
<P>
His remarks have resulted in the interruption of cross-straits
contacts, exchanges and dialogue, and the intensification and
retrogression of relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
More serious is the prospect that if Taiwan's separatist force'
s attempt to "amend the Constitution and laws" comes to fruition,
the reunification process will be aborted in the end, Chen
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We fully respect and understand the Taiwan compatriots'
aspiration to become the masters of their homeland," Chen said,
adding that most Taiwanese are pursuing this goal within the
context of the peaceful reunification of China through cross-
Strait exchanges, co-operation and deeper understanding.
</P>
<P>
But Lee Teng-hui's remark went against the fundamental
interests of the Taiwan people and the will of the Chinese nation
to reunify the motherland, and is bound to fail, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that maintaining sovereignty and territorial
integrity is the sacred task of all Chinese, and the people on
both sides of the Taiwan Straits share common interests.
</P>
<P>
"We will firmly adhere to 'peaceful reunification' and `one
country, two systems' in the fight against Le Teng-hui's
separatist attempts in order to accomplish the final reunification
of the motherland," Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Safety Beefed Up in Manila After Powerful Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Safety in the Philippine capital
of Manila has been beefed up following the powerful explosion at
the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) complex in Manila after
midnight Thursday, which killed seven people and injured scores.
</P>
<P>
The blast, which was centered in the NBI's Special
Investigation Division office, sparked a two-hour fire. Several
firearms and ammunition as well as office equipment and documents
were damaged by the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The Western Police District has mounted a thorough
investigation of the explosion and those who were wounded in the
explosion have been interviewed.
</P>
<P>
NBI Director Federico Opinion said the explosion could be
targeted at SID chief Ruel Lazala, who headed a team which had
conducted a big drug operation recently.
</P>
<P>
However, there was no official report yet on what type of
device exploded in the SID office.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado declined to comment on the
NBI explosion, saying he would rather wait for the result of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Deputy Director General Edmundo Larroza of
the Philippine National Police (PNP) said the police were looking
from three angles in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
But Larroza refused to elaborate saying it might jeopardize the
 ongoing investigation. He said authorities would like to know the
real motive of the early dawn bombing.
</P>
<P>
The PNP is helping the NBI to find a clue as to who are the
people behind the bombing. Additional bomb experts have been sent
to assist the NBI and the Western Police District in identifying
the suspects as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the headquarters of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines (AFP) has declared a "red alert" state in the wake of
the deadly bomb explosion.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier General Alberto Braganza, commander of the AFP
headquarters, said the "heightened alert" is part of the security
precaution because "we cannot take chances."
</P>
<P>
According to Braganza, a program dubbed "Operation Hawk Eye"
has been fully enforced in Camp Aguinaldo, the nerve center of the
military operation, on a daily basis to prevent the entry of
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Braganza ordered the doubling of armed guards posted in
strategic points inside the camp, especially in the evening.
Motorized armed sentinels also roamed around the military complex.
</P>
<P>
Civilians entering Camp Aguinaldo were checked to ensure that
they were not bringing in guns and explosives. Vehicles were
likewise subject to a thorough check.
</P>
<P>
Senator Rene Cayetano, also chairman of the Senate Committee on
Justice and Human Rights, urged the Senate to inquire into the
devastating explosion.
</P>
<P>
Cayetano also urged NBI Director Opinion to immediately
investigate into the incident and determine the persons
responsible for the explosion.
</P>
<P>
"The NBI should be the last edifice to be victimized by this
alarming incident," he noted. "We have to ensure that this will
never happen again."
</P>
<P>
"The safety and security of public institution as well as
private establishments should be one of our pressing concerns," he
stressed.

000 boxes of suspected contraband cigarettes, valued at 20 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, Customs officials opened five containers
holding imported goods in the Waigaoqiao port area, only to find
that they were full of British-made "555" brand cigarettes, local
sources said.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary investigation indicates that the five containers
belong to a foreign trade company, which claimed that the
containers held other goods than cigarettes on its declaration
form.
</P>
<P>
Such a large case of cigarettes smuggling through general trade
channels is rare in Shanghai, according to Customs officials, and
the case is still under investigation.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Blames U.S. for Stalemate in Four-party Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Thursday blamed the United States for
a deadlock in the latest round of four-party talks on Korean
Peninsula issues, saying the U.S. intentionally made use of the
four-way talks to suffocate the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"On the sixth round of four-way talks held in Geneva, no
progress was made because of the unreasonable attitude of the U.S.,
" a DPRK foreign ministry spokesman told the Korean Central News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
"The recent and previous rounds of talks convinced us that the
U.S. is not willing to preserve peace and security on the Korean
peninsula," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The facts made it clear that the conditions are still not ripe
for a thorough discussion on Korean peninsula peace between the U.
S. and the DPRK, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Our side proposed discussing the U.S. troop pullout from South
Korea and the conclusion of a peace agreement between the U.S. and
the DPRK. ...The U.S. side, however, paid a deaf ear to our fair
and above-board demand and pursued sinister purposes," the
spokesman said, criticizing the U.S. for insisting on its previous
positions, which it has held ever since the first session of talks.
</P>
<P>
The only reason for the DPRK to attend all the preliminary and
formal rounds of talks is not to let any peace chance pass, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no change in our principled position to achieve peace
and security on the Korean peninsula through dialogue and
negotiation," the spokesman pointed out, adding that whenever and
wherever the U.S. want to sit down to discuss the withdrawal of 37,
000 U.S. troops from South Korea and the conclusion of a peace
treaty with Pyongyang, the DPRK will "make a positive response".
</P>
<P>
The future of four-way talks rests entirely with the U.S., the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The five-day sixth round of talks involving the DPRK, South
Korea, China and the United States, closed Monday with a joint
statement which said only that the next round should be held "as
quickly as possible." Five previous sessions made little headway.

<HEADLINE> PLA Condemn Li Hongzhi's Role in Illegal Gathering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- After learning the truth
regarding the illegal gathering at Zhongnanhai by Falun Gong
practitioners on April 25, officers and men of the Chinese People'
s Liberation Army (PLA) and the People's Armed Police Force across
the country noted that the gathering was a well-prepared and well-
organized major political incident.
</P>
<P>
The gathering, which was directly plotted and controlled by Li
Hongzhi, the ringleader of the outlawed Falun Gong cult, was aimed
at exerting pressure on the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the
central government, and disrupting the country's stable political
situation, they said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the illegal gathering at Zhongnanhai,
headquarters of the CPC Central Committee and the central
government, was the most serious political incident since the 1989
political turmoil, and fully unveiled Li's political ambition and
schemes.
</P>
<P>
They said that they fully support the CPC Central Committee's
timely and wise decision to ban Falun Gong in accordance with the
law, and will not tolerate anyone's attempt to destabilize the
country.
</P>
<P>
They pledged to further uncover and criticize the vicious
nature of Li Hongzhi and Falun Gong and to safeguard the country's
stability and unity.

<HEADLINE> HK to Develop Waste-to-Energy Incineration Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government is
planning to develop two state-of-the-art Waste-to-Energy
Incineration Facilities to handle its municipal solid waste
disposal problem.
</P>
<P>
With an estimated cost of 10 billion HK dollars (1.28 billion U.
S. dollars), the facilities are expected to handle 6,000 tons
solid waste every day, said a spokesman for the Planning,
Environment and Lands Bureau Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the imminent landfill shortage problem, incineration
has been proposed as the major solid waste treatment technology to
extend our landfill life and reduce the demand of future landfill
space," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Modern incineration can reduce the volume of non-recyclable
waste before landfilling by some 85 percent, render the refuse
inert and allow recovery of energy from refuse for community
consumption," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said a feasibility study is being conducted, and the study
addresses the engineering feasibility, environmental acceptability,
health impacts, contract arrangement, site selection, preliminary
design and cost estimates.
</P>
<P>
"The study is expected to be completed later this year.
Suitable sites for the development of incinerators have not yet
been decided," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Poll Sees Easy Win for BJP-Led Coalition in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The coalition led by the
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will have a comfortable win and
secure between 322 and 336 seats in the coming Lok Sabha (lower
house) elections, an opinion poll by the India Today-Insight
magazine said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The opinion poll was conducted between August 4 and 8 and
covered 20,640 registered voters in 86 constituencies in 16
states.
</P>
<P>
It said that the BJP's vote may touch 32 percent and the party
may enter the new Lok Sabha with nearly 320 MPs.
</P>
<P>
It also predicts between 132 and 146 seats for the Congress
party and its allies and between 70 and 80 for other parties.
</P>
<P>
"Backed by the euphoria of a victorious encounter in Kargil (in
Kashmir) and a series of strategic alliances with powerful
regional players, (BJP leader Atal Bihari) Vajpayee begins the
election campaign with an awesome popularity rating, both
personally and for his government," the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
For the Congress, the magazine said the unresolved confusion
between peddling one-party rule and striking deals with regional
players was proving costly.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wholesale Prices Rise Moderately in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The wholesale prices
increased just 0.2 percent in July because a big jump in energy
prices overwhelmed a sharp drop in food costs, the Labor
Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The July's advance in the Producer Price Index matched the 0.2
percent rise in May. It was slightly better than expected. Many
analysts had been anticipating that the prices would rise 0.3
percent in July. June's prices had actually fallen 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the moderate gain in wholesale prices, if matched
at the consumer level, could ease concerns somewhat at the Federal
Reserve about a potential breakout of inflation.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, wholesale prices have been rising at an
annual rate of 1.7 percent, compared to no change for all of 1998.
The rise in this year's wholesale prices is coming from big jump
in energy costs, which had been falling for much of 1998.
</P>
<P>
For July, energy costs picked up 3.4 percent, led by 12.7
percent increase in gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
The July gain in gasoline prices was the largest since a 26
percent surge in April, which helped push overall wholesale prices
up by 0.5 percent that month, the biggest increase this year. That
gain plus an even bigger rise in consumer prices in April put the
Fed on inflation alert and led to a June 30 increase in a key Fed
interest rate.
</P>
<P>
The 3.4 percent rise in energy costs in July was partially
offset by a 0.9 percent drop in food prices. Beef prices, which
had risen sharply in June, declined by 3.4 percent in July, the
biggest one-month drop since February 1997.
</P>
<P>
If excluding the volatile energy and food categories,
wholesales prices were unchanged in July, after having fallen 0.2
percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Outside of food and energy, inflation was kept in check by a
0.2 percent drop in the price of new cars.

<HEADLINE> Western Digital to Cut 2,500 Workers in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Disk drive maker Western
Digital (WD), a transnational company in Singapore, embarked on a
retrenchment exercise Friday to cut 2,500 jobs at Chai Chee plant
in Singapore in its operation restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The company laid off the first group of 325 workers, of which
slightly less than half are local workers, and the next group will
be retrenched in October.
</P>
<P>
Local media quoted WD's Vice President of Asian Operations John
Coyne as saying that the company is moving some operations to
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and the Singapore plant will focus on
product design and making high-end disk drives.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Ministry of Manpower confirmed that WD has informed
the ministry that they will realigning their hard drive
manufacturing activities and the realignment will result in
reduction of approximately 2,500 WD workers.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, together with its partners and WD, has
co-organized several re-employment and re-training events for the
affected workers and invited six electronics companies to
participate in the outplacement job fair held Friday on WD's
premises.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the retrenchment, Singapore's National Trades Union
Congress (NTUC) said WD has treated its workers fairly in its
retrenchment package.
</P>
<P>
NTUC Deputy Secretary-General Heng Chee How said that the
lay-offs reflected the fierce global competition and price erosion
faced by disk drive makers.
</P>
<P>
It is also a reminder that the economic recovery is still
fraught with uncertainty, Heng added.

<HEADLINE> Russia Intensifies Operation Against Rebels in Daghestan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia brought in more troops and
hardware to its southern Daghestan republic Friday for intensified
operations against Islamic militants controlling several villages
near the breakaway Chechen republic.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, acting Prime Minister Vladimir Putin indicated that
the campaign might be carried into Chechnya, the strongest-ever
indication that operation in Daghestan could lead to a wider war.
</P>
<P>
Five airplanes arrived in the Daghestani capital of Makhachkala
Friday carrying troops, weapons and medical equipment. Russian
defense officials gave no further details about the shipment.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with regional officials in Tomsk, Siberia, Putin
said federal authorities would pound rebel positions wherever
possible, including inside Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"Chechnya - this is the territory of Russia, and we will strike
at militants wherever they are located," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He said a major offensive to drive out the rebels had begun,
and the Defense Ministry said it was working to fortify strategic
facilities in the region, including a mountain tunnel that was
seized Thursday night, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev ordered a pay
rise to Russian fighters in Dagestan, ranging from 70 percent to
170 percent depending on the nature of their mission, Tass
reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the Defense Ministry, air force planes have flown
over 200 sorties in missions against the rebels in the first day
of the operation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry said Thursday that 150 rebels
had been killed and 300 wounded as federal troops destroyed two
rebel bases, four anti-aircraft guns and two trucks with militants
inside.
</P>
<P>
The regional press center in the Daghestani capital said Friday
that six rebels were captured, including Shamil Ashikov, the
interpreter of Khottab, who was believed one of the two
masterminds of rebel infiltration into Daghestan.
</P>
<P>
Ashikov told interrogators that the majority of the guerrilla
force is made up of Chechens with some Arabs and residents from
Daghestan.
</P>
<P>
The rebels acknowledged losses for the first time Thursday, but
said only five of their fighters had been killed and 15 wounded,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Russian authorities said they have lost three helicopters
and 10 soldiers in the operation and 27 soldiers have been wounded.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Delivering Air Defense Systems to Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry on
Friday dismissed as speculation British press reports that Russia
shipped Yugoslavia components for S-300 air defense systems before
the beginning of the NATO air campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Russia did not send any weapons or their components to
Yugoslavia," the Interfax news agency quoted the ministry as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Russia strictly observed and continues to observe the embargo
on arms deliveries to Yugoslavia imposed by pertinent U.N.
Security Council resolutions," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The speculations in the British press are meant only to
justify the serious violations of the corresponding U.N. Security
Council resolutions that had the purpose of the large-scale arming
of the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army, which in the long run led
to the failure of the negotiations for a settlement in the area,"
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Jane's Defense Weekly, quoting Serbian sources, reported that S-
300 components were smuggled into Yugoslavia -- along with a
humanitarian convoy -- allegedly hidden in fuel tanks. The
beginning of the NATO air attacks, on March 24, prevented the
delivery of the remaining S-300 components, the Weekly said.
</P>
<P>
Jane's claimed that the components had been hidden in an
underground tunnel on the outskirts of Belgrade, the Yugoslav
capital, Interfax reported.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- People across China have said
that they have further penetrated the true nature of Li Hongzhi
and his outlawed Falun Gong sect, after the entire story of the
April 25 illegal gathering at Zhongnanhai by Falun Gong
practitioners was made public Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Some former practitioners at Qinghua University said that they
regretted having been involved in the sect, upon learning of the
behind-the-scenes activities of Li Hongzhi during the gathering.
</P>
<P>
The university staff and students held that the sect was aimed
at disturbing the country's economic development, and jeopardizing
its political situation of stability and unity.
</P>
<P>
People in north China's Tianjin City expressed indignation over
Li and his role in the gathering. The city leadership held
unanimously that the April 25 illegal gathering was a well-planned
incident aimed at exerting pressure upon the Communist Party of
China and the central government, a sign that Li has been
collaborating with anti-China forces both in China and overseas. (

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leaders Welcome Back Table Tennis Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, Hebei Province, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese
leaders welcomed back their table tennis delegation on Friday in a
meeting here after the paddlers swept all the gold and silver
medals in the 45th World Table Tennis Championships in Eindhoven,
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by Li Ruihuan and Li Lanqing, members
of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, and Wang Zhongyu, State
Councilor and Secretary-General of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, Chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference who also serves as honorary chairman of
the Chinese Table Tennis Association, extended congratulations and
thanks to the Chinese players for their steady great successes in
the international competitions.
</P>
<P>
It's not an easy thing to keep leading the table tennis world
with consecutive triumphes, said the Chinese leader, urging the
Chinese table tennis delegation to find out the truth behind their
success as it will most suitably serve as a good example for the
blossom of other sports in the world.
</P>
<P>
Li Lanqing, also Vice Premier, hailed the Chinese players for
another miracle in the table tennis history as they overcame the
inconvience of the shift of the venue and the postponement of the
competitions to repeat the feats achieved by their predecessors
who swept all the gold medals in both the 36th and 43rd World
Championships in 1981 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The strong sense of great patriotism, the scientific approach
in hard training, the unremitting efforts for further improvement
after successes, are the keys for the long-time prosperity of the
Chinese table tennis in the world, said the Chinese Vice Premier.
</P>
<P>
Li Lanqing also urged the Chinese paddlers to make further
contribution to the development of the Chinese table tennis and to
the peace and friendship in the world.

<HEADLINE> CIBC Estate Biggest Sale in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce (CIBC) is selling its entire real-estate portfolio in the
biggest deal of the kind in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
A total of 45 office, retail, industrial and development
properties across Canada will be put on sale between October 1999
and April 2000, Canadian newspapers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Although CIBC refused to put a price tag on this deal, industry
insiders pegged the value at 1.3 billion to over 2 billion
Canadian dollars (about 0.88 to 1.35 billion U.S. dollars),
according to the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The "crown jewel" of this package is reported to be Toronto's
Commerce Court, which boasts the prime location at Bay and King
streets.
</P>
<P>
The two-million-square-foot complex, including CIBC's head
office, is valued at between 6 million to 8 million Canadian
dollars (about 4.05 to 7.69 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
CIBC's real estate sale is "the last of Canada's big banks to
get out of the commercial real-estate business," the newspapers
said.
</P>
<P>
Royal Bank and Canada made a similar move in May when it placed
"for sale" signs on 33 properties. The Scotiabank has also put its
remaining real-estate assets on the market while other banks
dumped their holdings years ago, the newspapers added.
</P>
<P>
The spate of sales is prompted by the rebounding of the
commercial real-estate market, which endured the recession of the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
"Most of them are now going to get out of it without losing any
money," a Toronto real-estate firm director was quoted as saying.

The Dutch midfielder was prescribed the eye drops to treat a

<HEADLINE> China Forbids Redundant Industrial, Commercial Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The State Economic and Trade
Commission (SETC) today issued a directive detailing specific
industrial and commercial investment areas where redundant
construction will be banned as of September 1.
</P>
<P>
The commission urged localities not to launch any projects that
involve an apparent overproduction in such sectors.
</P>
<P>
The directive is an important industrial policy statement aimed
at prohibiting redundant construction, speeding up industrial
restructuring and reorganization, guiding investment and lifting
State-owned enterprises out of difficulties within three years,
said Zhang Zhigang, deputy minister in charge of the SETC.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of banned projects in the directive involve 17
sectors, including 201 items such as iron, nonferrous metals, coal
and gold mining, and the petrochemicals industry. These industries
are all characterized by overproduction, technological
backwardness, environmental pollution and waste of resources.
</P>
<P>
The document is subject to revision and adjustments according
to market changes and industrial development, the official said,
adding that the commission is working on a new policy to encourage
investments.
</P>
<P>
Redundant construction is a headache in China's economic
activities, and serious problems arising from low-level duplicated
construction have become outstanding as market competition heats
up, leading to serious stockpiling of products, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the National Bureau of Statistics showed that only
a third of China's industrial sectors utilize more than 80 percent
of their productive forces.
</P>
<P>
The SETC forbids government departments and banks at all levels
approving investment projects and loans in fixed assets covered in
the directive.

<HEADLINE> Malawian MPs Gun for More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Malawian Parliament Tuesday
passed the 1999/2000 budget estimates after a six-hour marathon
debate during which some members gunned for an increase to the
money allocated for parliament expenditure, the Malawian News
Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The MPs adopted their votes in this years expenditure on
recurrent and development accounts estimates which totalled 22,923
million kwacha or 916. 92 million U.S. dollars despite complaints.
</P>
<P>
The main controversy arose over votes concerning the committee
of supply of parliament. MPs said the 126,369,000 kwacha (505,476
U. S. dollars) given to the national assembly was below last
year's allocation although the numbers in the house have increased
to 193 from 177.
</P>
<P>
Rumphi east MP Gowa Nyasulu asked Finance Minister Cassim
Chilumpha to reconsider the vote since the house was autonomous
and not controlled by the executive.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Chilumpha said he saw no problems with Nyasulu's
proposal, noting that depending on necessity a supplementary
budget will deal with such matters.
</P>
<P>
"We can only deal with this in form of revised and
supplementary estimates," he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said as a member of parliament, he understood the problem,
but as finance minister, he did not want to blow the budget and
prevent government from reducing inflation.
</P>
<P>
Hetherwick Ntaba, lilongwe southeast MP, described the national
assembly allocation as "unrealistic," noting that there were two
revisions on the house's expenditure last year although parliament
was given 159 million kwacha (6.36 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"With 193 MPs and escalating prices, there is no way the figure
can be at 126 million kwacha. Could the minister not take into
account?" he queried.
</P>
<P>
But Karonga northwest MP Green Mwamondwe asked the minister why
he could not allow the national assembly to adjust the budget when
ministries do so.
</P>
<P>
"Ministries blow the budget, why can't we also blow the budget
when we are the ones enacting the laws and spend time in
parliament approving these allocations?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Chilumpha assured the members that their contributions were
valid because now the treasury would know what the house wants. He
said he was equally anxious to see that the house committees were
functional and the only way forward was for members to pass the
vote and not to delay it.
</P>
<P>
The vote was therefore passed like many other votes in this
year's expenditure on recurrent and development accounts estimates
which totalled 22,923 million kwacha (916.92 million U. S.
dollars).

PARIS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- France will send five military

announced Friday.
</P>

The U.N. Security Council voted on August 6 to deploy the first
group of 90 military observers for the cease-fire in the

which is crucial for regional stability," said Foreign Ministry
Assistant Spokesman Francois Rivasseau.
</P>
<P>
The countries involved in the conflict in the Great Lakes
region -- the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Uganda,
Zimbabwe, Chad and Angola -- signed the cease-fire agreement on
July 10 in Lusaka, Zambia.
</P>
<P>
France called on all the countries involved to make efforts for
the success of peace, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that the cease-fire should be effective in the
field and that the rebel movement of Congolese Rally for Democracy,
the only one which has not signed the agreement, do it as soon as
possible," he said.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Stresses Progress in Socialist Ethics in Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao
stressed that equal importance should be given to increasing
farmers' incomes and keeping stability in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection tour of east China's Anhui Province, the
vice-premier said that China's rural reform and development is now
at a crucial stage. While focusing on economic development, local
authorities should also attach great importance to progress in
socialist ethics and democratic and legal construction in rural
areas, in order to maintain stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that enhancing socialist ethical progress is a
significant and long-term task in socialist construction, and its
purpose is to meet the demand of building a new-style rural modern
economy. To achieve this, farmers' ethical, cultural and
scientific qualities should be enhanced, he said.
</P>
<P>
The main task of the rural reform is to enhance farmers'
education in Deng Xiaoping Theory and the guidelines of the
Communist Party, promote scientific and civilized thinking,
strengthen democratic and legal construction and foster the spirit
of hard work, Wen Jiabao noted.
</P>
<P>
Wen said that promotion of socialist ethical progress should be
pursued in line with the development of the local rural economy.
Rural areas at different development levels should be treated
differently, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wen asked local governments to map out plans to promote the
harmonious development of material civilization and ethical
progress, so as to improve the overall economic and social level
in rural China.
</P>
<P>
He also urged local authorities to make more efforts to resolve
farmers' difficulties, so that they might give full play to their
initiative.

<HEADLINE> Land Mines in S. Somalia Kill 28 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Driving in Southern Somalia is
 dangerous especially around the war ravaged areas of Bay, Bakol
and Lower Jubba regions. Besides bloody ambushes by armed
militiamen, the land mines planted there claim human lives daily
there.
</P>
<P>
At least 28 people were killed and more than two others were
wounded when a Toyota pick up vehicle they were travelling in hit
a land mine Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to VHF field radio reports, the vehicle transporting
more than 35 passengers and their goods just left the town of Bur
Hakaba, about 180 Kms South of the capital at 9:00 am local time
Friday morning on its way to Bur Eylo village, about 40 Kms
further North of Bur Hakaba town when it hit the land mine.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of people have rushed to the scene of the explosion just
after the loud blast of the anti-tank land mine burst out. The
people of Bur Eylo village were the first to reach the land mine
victims since the explosion took place just outside their village.
One of the eyewitnesses whom this reporter contacted on the VHF
radio said that the vehicle was turned to rubble while the land
mine amputated limbs of human beings, making the whole place
become a shambles.
</P>
<P>
No one claimed the responsibility of the land mine. However
both Bur Hakaba and Bur Eylo towns are run by the militiamen of
the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA)  fighting against the
forces of faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid. Nonetheless, a RRA
spokesman charged that Rahanwein elements loyal to Hussein Aidid
had planted the land mine in their efforts to destabilize the
region.
</P>
<P>
This land mine is just part of major fields of land mines
planted during the fighting for control of Bay region early in the
year. Both warring sides are known to have been undergoing such
activities in their attempts of strengthening their grip on the
pieces of land they controlled. The straight tarmac road between
Mogadishu and Baidoa remains closed following the fall of the
town into the hands of the RRA in early June this year.
</P>
<P>
The other roads closed for threats of land mines are beyond the
count, especially in the remote villages of Bay, Bakol and Lower
Jubba regions. The land mine plantation campaign is further
continuing to come closer and closer to the capital as the war
between the opposing factions continues. The last such incident
was a battle wagon belonging to Hussein Aidid's men which was
destroyed by a land mine just outside Aw-dhegleh town, about 80
Kms South of Mogadishu, early in August.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Enjoys Real Peace, Stability: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Cambodia Minister for
Commerce Cham Prasidh said here Friday that his country has
enjoyed real stability and peace since the general elections in
July 1998 but everything still has to start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
He made the point in an address to a seminar hosted by the
Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI).
</P>
<P>
Prasidh said two decades of internal conflicts have reduced
Cambodia into one of the least-developed countries and now peace
is prevailing in all parts of the country while security is
largely improving.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the current situation is conducive to
the development of a market-oriented type of economy and the
economy-oriented royal government of Cambodia has taken steps in
implementing economic and political reforms to change the domestic
environment while trying to catch up with a changing world.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that Cambodia needs external assistance for
rehabilitation and for the development of its shattered economy.
</P>
<P>
Prasidh said his country will pursue the "Asian way" or the
"ASEAN way" towards sustainable economic growth which is adapted
to the Khmer context and follow recommendations to build an
export-oriented economy, to base development on foreign direct
investment rather than governmental or multilateral aid, and to
turn Cambodia into Southeast Asia's granary and a pivotal place
for the transit of goods.
</P>
<P>
He also said neighboring countries' success and failure need to
be learned but a success story in one country is not necessarily
another one in Cambodia and the particularities of the Cambodian
context should always be taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
Before Prasidh's speech, SCCCI President Tay Beng Chuan made an
address to welcome Prasidh who is here on a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Due to some important policy directives announced by Cambodian
Prime Minister Hun Sen for broad fiscal reform, less spending on
defense and security, and tough action against corruption, illegal
logging and crime as well as Cambodia's entry into ASEAN and the
regaining of its seat at the United Nations, Tay said Cambodia's
current improved political stability and better economic
performance is bound to attract more trade and investments into
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Tay noted that 1998 saw a growth rate of 1 percent in
Cambodia's gross domestic product (GDP) and its improving economy
is anticipated to achieve a GDP growth of 4 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
On economic relations between Singapore and Cambodia, Tay said
Singapore's bilateral trade with Cambodia amounted to 595 million
Singapore dollars (355 million U.S. dollars), representing 0.75
percent of Singapore's total trade with ASEAN, and statistics
reveal that Singapore's imports from Cambodia, especially
garments, have registered very buoyant growth in 1998, up 49.3
percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
Singapore also has investments amounting to 200 million U.S.
dollars in Cambodia and has managed to emerge as the fourth
largest foreign investor in Cambodia, Tay added.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Iran Sign Memo on Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Iran Friday signed a
memorandum of understanding here at the end of the sixth meeting
of the Turkish-Iranian Higher Commission on Security in a bid to
combat terrorism and safeguard border security.
</P>
<P>
Under the memo, the two countries decided to set up a telephone
and fax line to enhance cooperation between the Turkish and
Iranian commanders concerned to fight against Turkey's outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
The commanders of the two countries will plan and coordinate
operations aimed at rendering  terrorist groups ineffective and
will exchange information on border security.
</P>
<P>
Unexpected controls can be made over the desired region with a
helicopter or any convenient vehicle against a terrorist group
upon the request of a commander, said the document.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the memo also covered the bombing
allegations of the Iranian side in the Piransehir region and the
Turkish side wanted the issue to be taken up again soon after its
delegation conducts a technical observation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has given a 50-page dossier to the Iranian side which
detailed the activities of the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Daily News reported on Monday that there are
currently about 50 PKK camps in Iran, in which 1,200 PKK rebels
are being trained every year.
</P>
<P>
These PKK militants are being brought to the Turkish border by
military planes belonging to Iran, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Iran and Turkey were strained when Iran claimed
that Turkish warplanes hit an Iranian military post and tents
belonging to Iranian tribesmen on July 18.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the bombardment had killed five people
and injured 10 others in the Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 a war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. Conflicts between the
Turkish security forces and the PKK rebels have claimed over
37,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> First Half CPI Inches Down in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Data released by Singapore
Department of Statistics Friday show that the Consumer Price Index
(CPI) for the first half of 1999 continued to inch down
year-on-year for households in different income groups.
</P>
<P>
The department said the CPI for all households, which declined
by 1.2 percent during the second half of 1998, continued its
downward trend falling by 0.3 percent year-on-year in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the first half of 1998, the CPI for the 20
percent lowest and 60 percent middle income groups rose by 0.9
percent and 0.1 percent respectively, it said.
</P>
<P>
Households in the 20 percent top income group, however,
experienced a negative inflation rate of 1.2 percent due mainly to
lower car prices and cheaper accommodation, it added.

NICOSIA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides has received personal thanks from Israeli President Ezer
Weizman and Prime Minister Ehud Barak for freeing two Israelis
jailed in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The two Israelis, Igar Damary, 49 and Udi Hargov, 37, were
sentenced in February to three years in jail for approaching a
restricted area and possessing banned listening devices without
the permission of the Cyprus authorities.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus government said Thursday that President Clerides decided
to grant pardon to the two Israelis and suspend their prison terms
as their continuing imprisonment "no longer served the national
interest."
</P>
<P>
"President Weizman had a long and very warm and friendly
conversation with President Clerides on Thursday evening during
which he thanked the President of Cyprus for suspending the
sentence," the Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Later Thursday, Barak also called Clerides to thank him
personally for his move.
</P>
<P>
Clerides has accepted an invitation from his Israeli
counterpart to pay an official visit to Israel.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Program Need Commitment: WHO Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The success of the HIV/AIDS
programs depends on the commitment of all sectors coupled with
favorable policies as the Ugandan experience has shown, Regional
Director for Africa of the World Health Organization (WHO) Ebrahim
Samba said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said, "HIV/AIDS prevention is, and should be the concern of
all persons, from the national commitment at the highest levels to
all sectors of the society."
</P>
<P>
Addressing reporters on the 49th session of the WHO regional
committee meeting scheduled from August 30 to September 3 in
Namibia, Samba said in Uganda the rates of HIV/AIDS infection in
the urban areas had declined by about 50 percent in teenage girls
and women between 15 and 19 years.
</P>
<P>
The rate of infection among the 15 to 19 years age groups in
Uganda currently stands at six percent against the staggering high
levels recorded at the peak of the pandemic in the early 1990's.
</P>
<P>
Samba said the Ugandan success demonstrates that it was
possible to turn the tide of HIV/AIDS scourge, particularly among
the young people, thereby making it possible to save the future
generation.
</P>
<P>
He said aggressive and sustained information and educational
programs paid dividends as the Ugandan experience had also shown.
</P>
<P>
Behavioral change was more important in the fighting against
the HIV/ AIDS pandemic, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the WHO and the World Bank were in the process of
setting up a fund to assist the treatment of HIV/AIDS patients in
Africa while efforts were being made for antiviral drugs to be
sold at cheaper prices in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, he said despite the fact that out of the 33 million
Aids cases in the world 23 million cases of them were in Africa,
the continent was not getting adequate budgetary allocation to
fight the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the 49th WHO African regional session,Samba said it
was significant in that it would determine next century's vision.
</P>
<P>
The session would discuss issues like disease control in Africa
in the 21st century, WHO's Roll Back Malaria initiative, HIV/AIDS
and other sexually transmitted diseases as well as the election of
a new regional director.
</P>
<P>
The meeting would be attended by health ministers from 46
member states of the WHO in the African region.

MOSCOW, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The suicide rate in Estonia is
two to four times higher than the world average, a sociologist
said Friday in Tallinn, capital of the Baltic state.
</P>
<P>
Ulle Suur, who heads the non-profit "Life Line" organization,

<P>
She said suicides are most frequently committed by men between
40 and 53 years old and women between 15 and 17, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Suur attributed the suicides to depression, fatigue, loneliness,
a poor economic situation, alcoholism, drugs and gambling.
</P>
<P>
The number of suicides in Estonia peaks in late August and
early September, and again around the Christmas and New Year
holidays, she said, adding that suicides tend to be more frequent
in the spring around the world.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on Gilman's Support for "Two States" Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government and
people are strongly indignant at and firmly opposed to the support
of some U.S. congressmen for Lee Teng-hui's "two states" statement.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao when asked to comment on the remarks made by
Benjamin Gilman, chairman of the International Relations Committee
of the US House of Representatives, during his recent visit to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that during his stay in Taiwan, Gilman, by making
public speeches, expressed support for Lee's "two states" remarks.
</P>
<P>
Gilman's actions have grossly interfered in China's internal
affairs and gone against the US government's commitment of
adherence to the one China policy, Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese government and people will resolutely
safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
motherland, and the attempt of the pro-Taiwan and anti-China
forces in the United States to block China's reunification and
split Taiwan from China is doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that pro-Taiwan and anti-China U.S. congressmen halt
at once their erroneous acts of infringing on China's sovereignty
and interfering in China's internal affairs," he added.

<HEADLINE> Japan's January-March GDP Growth Revised to 2.0 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan has revised upward its gross
domestic product (GDP) growth for the January-March period to 2.0
percent over the previous quarter, the Economic Planning Agency (
EPA) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The first-quarter GDP growth was initially reported as 1.9
percent growth in early June. The growth translates into an
annualized pace of 8.1 percent, revised upward from the initially
reported 7.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The first-quarter growth in GDP, the value of goods and
services minus net income from abroad, marked the first expansion
in six quarters, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
With the revision of the first-quarter GDP data, Japan's GDP
for fiscal 1998, which ended March 31, was revised to a 1.9
percent contraction from the initially reported 2.0 percent
shrinkage.
</P>
<P>
The upward revision of first-quarter GDP reflects data on
private capital spending, which was revised upward to show a 3.1
percent quarter-on-quarter increase from the initially reported 2.
5 percent growth as a result of new data from financial
institutions, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Data on exports and imports for the first quarter were also
revised, with growth in exports standing at zero against the
initially reported minus 0.3 percent, and imports at 2.8 percent
against the initially reported 1.8 percent, it said.

<HEADLINE> Malawi Gives Zimbabwe Truckers cold Shoulder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Malawian transporters have
refused to accept a proposal by their Zimbabwean counterparts to
liberalize the industry so as to allow vehicles of the two
countries to carry goods as they want, the Malawi News Agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement from the Road Transporters
Association, the transporters' representatives refused to
liberalize the industry at the joint route management group
meeting held on July 29 in lilongwe, Malawi.
</P>
<P>
"This proposal was made with the intention of scrapping the 3rd
country rule which currently prohibits transporters of each
country from carrying goods to or from a 3rd country not part of
the agreement," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Malawians felt that the proposal would not be of any
benefit to them as there is very little use of their country's
vehicles in trade that does not have a direct relationship with
the country. It was the Malawians' belief that doing so would only
consolidate their counterpart's monopolistic situation." the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Liberal Party to Remain in Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Liberal Party (LP) will
remain in the current coalition government with the Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP), LP leader Ichiro Ozawa said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation between the LDP and the LP will be maintained,"
Ozawa told a news conference after a meeting with Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi, who also serves as LDP president.
</P>
<P>
Ozawa said he and Obuchi agreed to continue debate on a bill to
cut 50 of the 200 proportional representation seats in the 500-
member House of Representatives (lower house) in the next Diet (
parliament) session, which is expected to be convened in the fall.
</P>
<P>
Ozawa had threatened to quit the two-party coalition government
unless the electoral reform bill at least cleared the lower house
by Friday, the final day of the current Diet session.
</P>
<P>
The proposed reform was part of a policy agreement reached by
the two parties before they launched the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
But the second largest opposition party, New Komeito, which is
planning to join the ruling bloc in response to an invitation by
Obuchi, is firmly opposed to the seat-reduction plan since more
than half of its lower house members were elected through
proportional representation.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the Obuchi-Ozawa meeting, the LP and New Komeito had
accepted a compromise plan presented by the LDP to carry over
debate on the bill to the next Diet session.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ozawa also accepted Obuchi's proposal to
start policy talks among the LDP, LP and New Komeito on the
proposed three-party alliance.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of the New Komeito in the ruling coalition would
give the bloc a majority in the House of Councilors (upper house),
which can obstruct passage of bills other than budgets and
treaties.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. to Jointly Explore Coal-Bed Methane in Jiangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The China United Coal-Bed
Methane Corp. Ltd (CUCBM) and SABA Petroleum Inc.of the United
States signed a contract here today to jointly explore methane
resources in south China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, the two partners will conduct exploration
in an area of 1,540.54 sq km at the Fengcheng Coalfield, which is
40 km from Nanchang, the provincial capital. The potential coal-
bed methane reserves in the region are estimated at 37.1 billion
cu m.
</P>
<P>
During the three-year exploration period, SABA will bear all
the expenses, estimated at 4.6 million U.S. dollars, to drill at
least 10 wildcat wells.
</P>
<P>
This contract is the sixth of its kind CUCBM has signed with a
foreign company since it was founded in 1996. According to a CUCBM
spokesman, the exploration and development of Fengcheng coal-bed
methane resources will ease the energy supply constraints in
Jiangxi, where no oil or gas deposits have been found so far. The
utilization of coal-bed methane is also expected to improve the
local energy consumption structure, which is dominated by coal at
present.
</P>
<P>
The Fengcheng Coalfield is said to have a high gas content, and
the methane resources have high permeability and lie at a moderate
depth, both circumstances favorable for industrial development.
Meanwhile, according to local officials, Fengcheng is located in
the central part of Jiangxi, where the relatively highly developed
economy and high energy consumption level add up to a promising
market.
</P>
<P>
China's total coal-bed methane resources are estimated at 35
trillion cu m, equivalent to 45 billion tons of standard coal and
equal to the country's conventional gas resources, ranking third
in the world.
</P>
<P>
CUCBM was established especially to speed up the country's coal-
bed methane development.
</P>
<P>
Companies from the United States and Australia have invested in
the exploitation of coal-bed methane in China. China has
designated coal mines in Liaoning, Anhui, and Shanxi provinces as
pilot projects for coal-bed methane development. It plans to set
up two methane production bases in north China's Shanxi Province
and build up an annual production capacity of one billion cu m by
the end of 2000. By the year 2010, the country will further boost
the capacity to 10 billion cu m.

<HEADLINE> No Restraints If India Intrudes Again: Pak Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's military spokesman
Brigadier Rashid Qureshi said Friday if India attempted to intrude
again into Pakistan's airspace or territory, there would not be
much restraints exercised.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the media here, Qureshi said it depends
entirely on India to maintain restraints because it has shot down
an aircraft of the Pakistan Navy well inside Pakistan's airspace.
</P>
<P>
It can not be expected by Pakistan to exercise restraints when
an Indian fighter aircraft attempts to intrude into Pakistani
airspace while Pakistani helicopters were trying to get the
victims' bodies which were in a bad shape, said Qureshi.
</P>
<P>
He said the first Indian claim was that this aircraft was shot
down in the Indian airspace and then it glided and fell into
Pakistani territory.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the aircraft was well about three miles inside
the Pakistani territory when it was shot at by the Indians. The
Indian air force sent a couple of their fighter aircraft as well
as some helicopters when Pakistani helicopters were picking up the
debris and the bodies of those killed.
</P>
<P>
This would be aimed, perhaps, at collecting parts of the
aircraft as they did previously and showed it on television, he
said.
</P>
<P>
To a question about the possibility of revenge by Pakistan, he
said, "That is something that the government has to decide. When
we say appropriate measures it means that we would not allow
repetition of what has happened."
</P>
<P>
"The way Indians have shot down a totally unarmed aircraft, we
will make sure that every inch of airspace and territory is
defended." he added.

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Party Promises Stable Govt in Manifesto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- India's Congress party issued
its election manifesto here Friday, pledging to provide a "stable,
able and experienced government" if it were elected in the general
elections next month.
</P>
<P>
"The most urgent need today is for a stable government, for a
government that completes its full term in office," said the
manifesto, released by Congress President Sonia Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
It accused the coalition government led by the Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) of failing to ensure national security and said the
18-month coalition demonstrated "unprincipled and opportunistic
politics."
</P>
<P>
The government, which collapsed last April, had spent more time
at pleasing coalition partners than with the task of governance,
the Congress said.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto promised to preserve and promote secularism,
enhance social justice and empower the weaker sections of the
society besides making the government responsible, representative
and responsive.
</P>
<P>
The 60-page manifesto also promised various measures to check
population boom, provide better education, health and housing
facilities and strengthen the public distribution system.
</P>
<P>
On economy, the Congress party pledged to accelerate economic
growth and new investments to make the country truly self-reliant
and create 10 million new jobs every year, broad-base agriculture
and promote small scale industries.
</P>
<P>
If it wins the election, the party said, it will usher in a
fiscal responsibility act to discipline government expenditure,
new companies, competition and foreign exchange, to restructure
the administered price mechanism in the oil sector to provide
subsidies for kerosene only.
</P>
<P>
It would work to create a South Asian Parliament and make South
Asia Free Trade Association in reality soon.
</P>
<P>
Saying that faster employment generation and poverty
alleviation would be the cornerstone of the party's economic
policies, the manifesto promised to speed up the implementation of
public and private infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
On relations with neighboring China, the party said
confidence-building measures would be expanded.
</P>
<P>
"While recognizing that we have border disputes with China that
need long-term negotiations in mutual good faith," the manifesto
said, the Congress would seek to build closer economic, trade,
cultural, educational and political ties with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
India, Pakistan and China have a joint responsibility for
nuclear non-proliferation in this region, said the manifesto.
</P>
<P>
The party said it would engage the United States in a
comprehensive dialogue on all issues of mutual concern and will
take concrete steps to institutionalize this dialogue.
</P>
<P>
It will also take steps to consolidate closer economic and
commercial links with the European Union and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The traditionally close relationship with Russia would be
continued and consolidated, said the Congress.

<TEXT>

LAGOS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's former Head of State
General Abdulsalami Abubakar may be invited by the country's
Senate to explain how a debt of 250 billion naira (2.63 billion
U.S. dollars) was accumulated between December 1998 and May 29
this year, reported a Nigerian newspaper Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Senate Committee on Local and Foreign Debts,
Senator Idris Abubakar said Thursday that a motion would be
submitted to invite principal players of the former government to
give explanations on the debt, said Vanguard, a leading Nigerian
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Senator Abubakar, in making a case for the invitation of Gen.
Abubakar and his other senior aids including former Minister of
Finance and Central Bank Governor said their explanations would
be offered at a public forum to enable Nigerians to ask them
questions.
</P>
<P>
He said that his committee had stumbled on the debt while it
was going through the financial records made available to it by
the finance ministry.
</P>
<P>
"We discovered that the sum of 250 billion naira was reflected
as debt from December 1998 and May 29 and when we inquired, we
were told it was for ways and means to fund government projects,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Before the May 29 hand-over to civilian rule this year,
officials in Abubakar administration had been criticized to
engage in a spending spree to leave the following government an
empty treasury.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has allocated a bigger budget for the promotion of peace
and order in the Philippines, Philippine News Agency (PNA)
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In his budget message to Congress, Estrada said he has
allocated 37.5 billion pesos (937 million U.S. dollars) for the
Department of Interior and local government for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
This amount represents a 21 percent increase from the 31
billion peso (775 million dollars) budget for the same purpose for
1999, the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
According to Estrada, his administration continues to give high
priority to peace and order "to ensure the safety of our people at
home, in the streets and their work place."
</P>
<P>
Estrada also pointed out that peace and order helps create an
environment conducive to vibrant business activities and, thus,
stimulate overall economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The president said he has urged Congress to approve his
proposed 651 billion peso (16.2 billion dollars) national budget
for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Also, the Estrada administration has reportedly set aside 685
million pesos (17 million dollars) for use of the Presidential
Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOC) and its operating arm, the
Presidential Anti-organized Crime Task Force (PAOCTF), in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
The PAO/PAOCTF budget, intended for operations as well as
coordination of efforts by all law enforcement agencies in peace
and order campaigns, is higher than the 1999 allocation of 518
million pesos (12.9 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Agency Chief Believed to Be Target of Bombing in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Lawmen investigating the
explosion at the Philippines' National Bureau of Investigation
(NBI) overnight said Friday that the agency's chief of the Special
Investigation Division (SID) could be the target of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The explosion killed seven men, six of them NBI agents, and
wounded 12 people. Those wounded were brought to different
hospitals in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
NBI Director Federico Opinion said the explosion took place at
the SID office at the ground floor of the NBI headquarters in Taft
avenue, Manila, shortly after midnight Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It left heavy damage to the SID office, sparking a fire which
affected the Security Management Division and the Quality Control
Department of the NBI, both at the ground floor of the building.
</P>
<P>
The Western Police District Bomb Disposal Unit and Arson Group
were helping the NBI in the probe of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Opinion said they were looking into the possibility that the
target of those behind the explosion could be the SID chief,
lawyer Ruel Lazala.
</P>
<P>
Lazala headed a team which conducted a big drug operation
recently, the NBI chief said. The SID office was charged with
investigation in big time drug syndicates, gunrunning groups and
other notorious criminals.
</P>
<P>
Other reports said the explosion occurred just after the SID
came from a raid in Paranaque city, where some Muslim suspects
were brought to the office.
</P>
<P>
Several firearms and ammunition as well as office equipment and
documents were reportedly damaged by the explosion.
</P>
<P>
An inventory of losses as a result of the explosion was still
being conducted by the NBI.
</P>
<P>
Another angle being pursued in the probe of the incident was
the possibility of terrorist hand in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
At the height of the clearing operations at the SID office, the
NBI was reported to have received another bomb threat, one of the
several they have received in the past days.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has made significant
progress in eliminating child labor and creating awareness among
the masses against this menace, Director Dani Appave of the
International Labor Organization (ILO) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a weekly press briefing here, Dani said that
"universal primary education and ratifying the proposal with
regard to minimum age for admission to employment are a real
breakthrough."
</P>
<P>
"There is more awareness among the masses," said Dani, adding
that he could not see any child engaged even in floor cleaning at
big industrial estates in Karachi, the southern port city.
</P>
<P>
He said that in spite of the many challenges and problems
encountered, the efforts made by the Pakistani government are
appreciable.
</P>
<P>
Dani also mentioned the efforts of the soccer ball industry in
the Punjab town of Sialkot and said they have made "tremendous
headway in the right direction."
</P>
<P>
He said the ILO with the cooperation of the Pakistani
government has finalized workers education program for the
promotion of awareness amongst workers with regard to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
He said the new manpower and labor policy announced by the
Pakistani government emphasizes the will of the government to
progress on the application of the ILO conventions ratified by
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The ILO official appreciated the constitution of a commission
on consolidation, simplification and rationalization of labor
laws. He stressed the need of full participation of all the social
partners in the commission.
</P>
<P>
Dani was of the view that Pakistan has short supply in skilled
labor. The government should do more in human resource
development, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The government hopes that the
National League for Democracy (NLD) will start to take a positive
and meaningful step by firstly dissolving the interim parliament
which the party had formed on September 16, 1998, according to a
Myanmar Information Sheet Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The official statement said that this positive step, if taken
by the NLD, can start to reactivate the political wheel, which has
been jammed, into normally rotating once again.
</P>
<P>
The government of Myanmar is pleased to learn that the NLD has
decided to show some interest in helping improve living conditions
in Myanmar, it stated, saying that the government welcomes serious
and meaningful ways and contributions from all its citizens and
from the international community as well.
</P>
<P>
The government has continuously encouraged the NLD to become a
constructive force in helping Myanmar along the path to a strong
and stable democracy, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
The government also encourages the NLD to reconsider the
interest of the nation and become a responsible member of the
Myanmar community by acting realistically and responsibly in
laying the foundation for a democratic system that is suitable to
Myanmar's requirements, culture and national security, and that
will last for many years, it added.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990 general election, sponsored by the present Myanmar
government and participated by 93 political parties, the NLD won
396 out of the 485 parliamentary seats.

<P>
BAGHDAD, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Warplanes of the United States
and Britain have shelled grain warehouses in the southern Iraqi
province of Muthana, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
INA quoted a Trade Ministry spokesman as saying that at 19:30
(1530 GMT) Tuesday, U.S. and British warplanes bombed warehouses
of the state company of construction materials which were used by
the State Grain Board.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bombardment caused damage to the rice in the
warehouses as well as the windows, ceilings and walls of some
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
"Such cowardly acts once again reveal the falsity of
allegations of U.S. and its crony Britain that they are keen on
alleviating sufferings of the Iraqi people," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's airstrikes against Iraq, U.S. and
British warplanes have been regularly attacking Iraqi civilian
facilities and military sites in the no-fly zones, causing severe
civilian casualties and property damage.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led Western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from attacks by Iraqi government troops.

<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- As a close friend of China, the
Pakistani people would like to share the joy of the Chinese people
who will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Iftikhar Hussain Kazmi, interim charge d'affaires of the
Pakistani Embassy, made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua
prior to the 52nd anniversary of Pakistan's Independence Day,
which falls on August 14.
</P>
<P>
Kazmi said, Pakistan will hold a series of events from
September 18 to 25, including a seminar on China in the 21st
century and painting and photo exhibits highlighting China's
progress in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chinese artists will be invited to perform Chinese
dances, music and acrobatics in several Pakistani cities, and a
Chinese film festival will also be held.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani people are equally happy and rejoicing at the
founding of the People's Republic of China, Kazmi said, adding
that increased people-to-people contacts will promote mutual
understanding, and will also be helpful to the growth of
friendship and cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Describing Sino-Pakistani relations as "close, cordial and
cooperative," the Pakistani diplomat said that this friendship is
a model for countries with different social systems, what leaders
of the two countries have called "time-tested and all-weather
friendship."

He also noted that bilateral economic and trade ties are not
strong as political relations, and said that potential in these
areas need to be tapped.
</P>
<P>
During the visit to China last June by Pakistan's Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif, an agreement was signed on setting up a
business council to promote trade links between the two countries.
"That will give some push to Sino-Pakistani economic and trade
relations," said Kazmi.
</P>
<P>
Noting that many Chinese companies are doing good business in
Pakistan in telecommunications, energy, oil, land, infrastructure,
and other areas, he said he believes that much remains to be done
to further bilateral cooperation in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In his view, tremendous changes have taken place in China.
Kazmi, who began work in Beijing more than two years ago, said
that the country's progress and prosperity are not only reflected
in the economy, but in all other aspects of life.
</P>
<P>
Now, underdeveloped provinces are catching up with the faster-
growing provinces, he said, expressing the belief that China will
enjoy a great future in the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> China Rejects Nicaragua Proposal on Taiwan's Status (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao today expressed strong condemnation of and
firm opposition to a proposal by Nicaragua and a number of other
countries calling for discussions of Taiwan's "representation" in
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that Nicaragua and several other countries recently
sent a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General asking for a
discussion of Taiwan's "representation" in the U.N., which is an
open attempt to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed out: "This is a wilful trample on the purpose and
principles of the U.N. Charter and gross interference in China's
internal affairs, and we strongly condemn and firmly oppose this."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is an intergovernmental international
organization composed of sovereign states, and its member
countries can only be sovereign states, he said.
</P>
<P>
There is only one China in the world, and the government of the
People's Republic of China is the sole legal representative of the
entire Chinese people, and Taiwan is a part of China, Zhu said,
adding that this is an internationally recognized fact and
therefore Taiwan has no qualifications whatsoever for joining the
U.N. and its special agencies in any form.

<P>
The spokesman also said that the representation of the People's
Republic of China in the United Nations was solved in a just,
thorough and complete way according to the Resolution N0. 2758
which was adopted by an overwhelming majority during the 26th U.N.
General Assembly 28 years ago.
</P>
<P>
This resolution, which conformed to historical trends, clearly
declares that the representative of the Government of the People's
Republic of China is the sole legal representative of China in the
U.N. organization, and also decided to restore all the rights of
the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and
immediately expelled the representatives of the Taiwan authorities
from the posts Taiwan authorities had illegally occupied in the
United Nations and all the UN agencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution not only has safeguarded the purpose and
principles of the U.N. Charter, but also defeated the conspiracy
of a small number of countries to attempt to create "two Chinas"
in the U.N. that year, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Zhu said, the General Committee of the U.N. General
Assembly every year has clearly refused to put the so-called "
representation issue" of Taiwan on their agenda, and this fully
demonstrates the firm stand of the majority member states of the U.
N. in safeguarding the authoritativeness of the U.N. Charter and
the Resolution 2758, Zhu said, adding that it also shows that any
conspiracy and attempt that go against the will of the majority of
U.N. member states are futile and very unpopular.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities are going against historical trend, and
while asserting the "two-state" remark, they instigate a small
number of countries to raise the issue of Taiwan's "representation
" in the United Nations, and this further reveals their stubborn
stand of sticking to split China, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he added, no matter what intrigues the Taiwan
authorities resort to or what pretext they cook up for "joining"
the United Nations, they will not be able to change the ending
that they are doomed to failure.

<P>
LHASA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Qamdo Prefecture in southwest
China's Tibet Autonomous Region will plant dragon spruce, fir, elm,
and other tree varieties in valley of the Jinsha River, a
tributary of the Yangtze River, during the next few years.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the prefecture's effort to protect the
ecological environment of the upper reaches of the country's
longest river, the Yangtze, in line with the central government's
policy.
</P>
<P>
The forests and shrubbery of the Jinsha River Valley play an
important role in protecting the ecological environment at the
source of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government began banning logging Jomda, Markam, and
Gonjo counties of the prefecture late last year in a bid to
improve the ecological environment of the region.
</P>
<P>
Qamdo and Nyingchi prefectures of Tibet reportedly will
implement an afforestation project at a cost of 300 million yuan
with the help of the State Forestry Administration.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia Friday recaptured the Bagram airbase, 50 kilometers north
of Kabul, the Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan-based news agency said forces loyal to former
defense minister Ahmad Shah Masood retreated from the base after
Taliban troops entered without a fight.
</P>
<P>
No independent sources have so far confirmed the news.
</P>
<P>
Bagram had been the only airbase of the Masood forces. They and
the Taliban militia have repeatedly changed hands on the airbase
during the large-scale fighting since late July.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban Thursday said the airbase was under the control of
neither side, but the opposition claimed to having been holding
it.
</P>
<P>
"As of this morning, the airbase was still held by the
opposition," said opposition spokesman Abdullah on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Parliament to Revise Alien Registration, Immigration Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Diet (parliament) Friday
enacted two bills to revise the country's alien registration and
immigration laws, abolishing fingerprinting for foreign residents
and making illegally staying in Japan a separate punishable
offense from illegal entry.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which revises Japan's Alien Registration Law,
requires nonpermanent foreign residents aged 16 and older living
more than one year in Japan to give a signature instead of a
fingerprint, and submit information of family members when they
register at local municipal offices.
</P>
<P>
Japan's fingerprinting system has been criticized as treating
foreigners like criminals since it was introduced in 1955.
</P>
<P>
The new law is expected to affect some 630,000 foreign
residents in Japan. The existing documents containing the actual
fingerprints will be destroyed, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
Japan abolished compulsory fingerprinting for foreigners with
permanent resident status in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Another bill revises the Immigration Control and Refugees
Recognition Law to make illegally staying in Japan a punishable
offense separate from illegal entry.
</P>
<P>
Under the current law, offenders found to have illegally stayed
in Japan three years or more after illegally entering the country
can only be deported and not prosecuted for the crime of illegal
entry.
</P>
<P>
With the revision, illegally staying in Japan will become a "
continuing offense" and offenders could be sentenced to up to
three years in prison, or fined up to 300,000 yen (about 2,631 U.S.
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Some 700 Million Tons of Garbage Besiege Beijing Residents: Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua)-- The Chinese capital is
overburdened by enormous amounts of solid waste, and
environmentalists have urged the drafting of laws and policies to
speed up garbage disposal, according to a report in the Beijing
Economic Daily.
</P>
<P>
A research team organized by the Beijing Municipal Committee of
the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), one
of China's democratic parties, recently conducted an investigation
on garbage disposal in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The investigation found the garbage generated by Beijing
enterprises and residents amounts to a total of 600 million to 700
million tons, "which means each urban dweller is besieged by 100
tons of garbage," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The research team has called for legislation to speed up and
regulate disposal work, and garbage disposal fees may be charged
on enterprises and residents.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the municipal government to publish
preferential policies to encourage factories to recycle their
rubbish.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Environmental and Sanitation Management
Bureau plans to build four refuse-burning power stations near
Beijing, which will consume 4,200 tons of garbage daily.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's investment in the construction of environmental
protection infrastructure between 1996 and 2000 will reach 1.1
billion yuan (133 million U.S. dollars), and 100 percent of the
daily rubbish will be processed by the year 2010, the bureau said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin not Dissolve Duma, Aide Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
will not disband the State Duma, Alexander Kotenkov, his
representative in the lower house, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
While some Duma members want the house to work peacefully until
the end of its term in December, others would like to precipitate
a political crisis, Kotenkov said following a meeting at the
Kremlin with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the lower house will approve Yeltsin
's nominee for prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma is scheduled to hold an extraordinary session
next Monday to debate the candidacy of Putin, who was picked up by
Yeltsin last Monday to replace Sergei Stepashin as the fifth
premier in about 18 months.
</P>
<P>
"Common sense should prevail in the Duma," the Interfax news
agency quoted Kotenkov as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most observers believe that the lower house will likely confirm
Putin in their first try Monday as most lawmakers want to leave
the latest government change behind and concentrate on the
preparations for the next parliamentary elections, scheduled for
December 19.

CAIRO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has urged India and Pakistan
to exercise restraint over their latest military confrontation,
Al-Akhbar daily reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Thursday that
Egypt hopes that India and Pakistan will have calm relations so

The spokesman, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
called on the two South Asian nuclear-armed rivals to avoid
further escalation of the tensions and seek peaceful solution to
their disputes.

Tensions soared between Islamabad and New Delhi after Indian
fighter jets shot down a Pakistani military aircraft on Tuesday,
killing all 16 crew members. After the attack, the troops along
the border of the countries were on high alert.
</P>
<P>
India accused the Pakistani plane of crossing into its air
space while Pakistan said the aircraft was inside its own air
space when it was attacked.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Taxi Drivers in Hong Kong Gear up for Courtesy Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Tourist
Association (HKTA) Friday launched a program to promote the
message of courtesy among taxi drivers.
</P>
<P>
The move is a highlight of the HKTA's community-wide "Be A Good
Host" campaign, said a spokesman for the HKTA at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to raise drivers' awareness of the importance
of the tourism industry to Hong Kong and of the vital work they
can do to make overseas guests feel welcome, as drivers are
recognized as being among the most prominent of front-line service
staff in promoting the city, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Through the program, they will be encouraged to provide
courteous and high-quality service, delivered in a sincere manner,
" the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey jointly conducted by the HKTA and Lingnan
University shows that of the qualities of a courteous taxi driver,
the top four responses were "friendliness", "good driving skills",
"a ready smile" and "good language proficiency."
</P>
<P>
More than 500 people were interviewed during the survey,
through which the HKTA aims to help taxi drivers better understand
expectations of passengers and that they can become "good host" by
improving their overall service standards, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA and Radio Television Hong Kong will also organize a
series of taxi driver-related activities in the coming two months,
including special radio program carrying the theme "courteous taxi
drivers and taxi association operators."

<HEADLINE> Press Leaders Refute Lee Teng-hui's Separatist Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The All-China Journalists
Association called a meeting today to refute Lee Teng-hui's "two
states" remarks.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Mengxiong, vice-chairman of the association, said Lee
openly opposed the "one China" principle and tried to separate
Taiwan from China, and this act is firmly opposed by all Chinese
people, including the country's 550,000 journalists.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the past month the mass media in the
country have strenuously criticized Lee Teng-hui's separatist
nature, and have upheld the common aspirations of the Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that working hard to unite all the Chinese people
including Taiwan compatriots to realize the reunification of the
motherland is a noble and unshirkable duty of the Chinese mass
media.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the People's Daily, Xinhua News Agency, CCTV,
Beijing Evening News, and other media organs delivered speeches at
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They said they believe that Lee's "two states" remarks reveal
Lee's desire to split the motherland, and that his opposition to
the "one China" principle is aimed at totally destroying the basis
for contacts, dialogue and negotiations across the Taiwan Straits,
and hindering the process of reunification.
</P>
<P>
They urged Lee to give up his "two states" remarks, adding that
otherwise Lee will be condemned by history.

<HEADLINE> New AIDS Drug Hit Uganda Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A new AIDS drug has hit the
Uganda market, bringing the total of anti-AIDS drugs to about 25.
</P>
<P>
Known as Ziagen(abacavir), the new drug is said to be very
effective, the New Vision newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is the first African country to access the drug because
of its advanced efforts in fighting AIDS, Sales and Marketing
Regional Director Parmindar Lotay of Glaxowellcome, the
manufacturing company, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A patient is supposed to take 300 milligrams of the white
tablet twice a day and this will cost the patient 420,000
shillings (300 U.S. dollars) a month, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The drug lowers theviral load in the blood and improves the
general health of the patient. If combined with other drugs like
AZT and 3TC, the new drug can reduce the virus in the body to
undetectable levels.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is among the first countries to have reported cases of
AIDS. The HIV prevalence rate has reduced to 12 percent among the
population from over 30 percent a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's remarkable achievements in this field have been
recognized by many international organizations and it has been
awarded several prizes for this progress.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the AIDS drugs manufactured so far are much
more than average Ugandan AIDS patients can afford. As a result,
many health institutions are still searching for an affordable
AIDS drug for common patients of the epidemic.

<HEADLINE> 7 Confirmed Dead in Explosion in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Seven fatalities have been
confirmed in the powerful explosion that ripped through the
Philippine National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) in Manila early
Friday.
</P>
<P>
An initial police report said the seven dead include six NBI
agents -- one supervising agent, two special investigators and
three confidential agents. The death report also involved a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the explosion killed eight persons and
injured 12. Still, no report has been released on the number of
the people in the building when the accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency (PNA) said NBI Director Opinion has
formed a probe team to investigate the explosion and death of some
of his NBI men.
</P>
<P>
A few hours after the explosion and fire, an unidentified man
called up by telephone the NBI office and threatened to blow up
the main NBI building, the PNA quoted Opinion as saying.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, NBI employees were ordered to vacate the building,
while a search operation to clear it of any bomb was being
conducted.
</P>
<P>
However, the bomb threat proved to be false and the NBI workers
returned to their offices, Opinion said.
</P>
<P>
Opinion said the NBI did not know yet the cause of the
explosion as this was being probed yet.
</P>
<P>
But he said the explosion occurred just after the NBI's special
investigation division (SID) came from a raid in Paranaque City,
where some Muslim suspects were brought to the office.
</P>
<P>
According to Opinion, the SID office was one of the
high-profile NBI offices charged with investigations on big time
drug syndicates, gunrunning groups and other notorious criminals.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for Signing Four Geneva Conventions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) called
here Friday on all countries that have not yet signed the four
Geneva Conventions to sign the conventions so to become a party to
the Geneva Conventions as well as all major treaties in the
humanitarian field.
</P>
<P>
Finland, in the capacity of the current EU presidency, made the
appeal on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the four Geneva
Conventions.
</P>
<P>
An EU declaration from the Embassy of Finland in Lusaka, said
that the four Conventions form the basic treaties of international
humanitarian law represent the basic principles of humanity.
</P>
<P>
It said that the anniversary of the four Geneva Conventions is
a time to take stock and to promote the implementation of
international humanitarian law in all armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"The Conventions are as necessary today as they were fifty
years ago and the Union stresses the importance of full compliance
with the provisions of the Conventions," said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
Respect for, as well as protection and humane treatment of the
victims of armed conflicts are the main duties of the parties to
the Conventions, it said.
</P>
<P>
It said that EU deplores the persistent violations of
humanitarian law. In today's conflicts the important distinctions
between combatants and civilians have often become blurred: the
safety of humanitarian workers is not respected and children and
other vulnerable groups have become targets of the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
EU pledges its support to the International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC), saying that the role of the ICRC in ensuring
that the humanitarian rule are respected is vital.

<HEADLINE> Top Law Official Calls for End to Local Protectionism (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese official in
charge of law and order urged local and departmental leaders today
to abandon protectionism and put an end to the wide-spread
practice of interfering in the enforcement of court rulings.
</P>
<P>
Luo Gan, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and state councilor, made
the appeal here today at a national tele-conference of the CPC's
Central Commission of Politics and Law. Luo also heads this
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Because of economic interests, local and departmental
protectionism has long plagued Chinese courts in the enforcement
of court orders, and has resulted in "law enforcement difficulties,
" now well-known among legal professionals.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of June this year, more than
850,000 court rulings were yet to be executed, involving over 259
billion yuan (31.2 billion US dollars). Illegal official orders
and violent activities interfering in the enforcement of court
rulings have been common an occurrence across the country.
</P>
<P>
"Solving the problem of law-enforcement is not only the

<P>
Luo outlined several steps to be taken against interference
in the enforcement of court rulings at today's meeting:
</P>
<P>

national law and the enforcement of court orders should be
resolutely nullified soon;
</P>
<P>
-- Those illegally interfering in the enforcement of court
orders and causing severe consequences shall be investigated for
further punishment;
</P>
<P>
-- For enterprises which illegally transfer their property
in an effort to evade debts or instigate a large number of workers
to challenge and stymie the enforcement of court orders, related
Party committees and government offices should take prompt action
to punish those responsible.
</P>
<P>
-- A nationwide inspection shall be launched jointly by
local Party committees and local legislative bodies later this
year to address this issue, and the number of non-enforceable
court rulings shall be substantially reduced by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Yang, president of the Supreme People's Court, said at

<HEADLINE> Polygamy Impairs Stability in UAE Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Polygamy and marriages
involving different nationalities pose the greatest threat to the
stability of families in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), according
to a recent poll.
2 4@5
</P>
<P>
Some 72 percent of the men and 70 percent of the women
investigated agree that polygamy is one of the main destabilizing
factors of UAE families, says the poll published in the August
issue of Al Mawadda, an Abu Dhabi-based quarterly magazine.
</P>
<P>
In a Muslim country like the UAE, men are allowed to have up to
four wives. Wives are confined to their houses for most of the
time.
</P>
<P>
The poll, in the form of answering a questionnaire, was
attended by 50 men and 50 women. All the women and half of the men
believe that the difference in nationalities of husband and wife
is also a primary negative factor of family instability.
</P>
<P>
Marriages between UAE men and foreign women have been
increasing in recent years. However, at least 60 percent of such
marriages end in divorce due to difference in cultural backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
In some Gulf countries, marrying foreign women are not
allowed. The UAE may also take the measure someday, sociologists
say.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Ranked Among Top Emerging Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa had arisen as
one of the most popular emerging markets in the aftermath of the
financial crises of the past two years, according to Standard &AMP;
Poor's Micropal, one of the World's leading research houses.
</P>
<P>
It said in its latest survey of 94 emerging markets that South
Africa had attracted net inflows of 175 million U.S. dollars in
the first quarter of this year, ranking the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Another Micropal survey among 32 global emerging market equity
funds showed that the trend continued into April, with South
Africa attracting more than two thirds of the $300 million
invested in African and Middle Eastern markets during the month.
</P>
<P>
The funds pumped almost 1.1 billion dollars into emerging
markets in April, a major show of confidence, considering they had
invested only 85 million dollars in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The quarterly and monthly surveys also confirmed that east
Asia, the original source of much of the emerging market crises,
was firmly back in favor. It attracted the largest flows with
about 550 million dollars during April, followed by Africa and the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Micropal said South Africa was the fourth most popular country
on an average weighted basis during that month, with the 36 funds
increasing their exposure by 2.6 percent to 7.86 percent between
March and April.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Observing Ozone Layer in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-one Chinese and Japanese
scientists are in Tibet for one month to observe the ozone layer
there and carry out relevant studies.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences and Nagoya University in Japan have
already arrived in Tibet for trips to Lhasa, Xigaze, and
Yangbajain to conduct their research. They will also release a
high-altitude balloon to monitor the ozone layer above Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The scientific expedition, which is jointly sponsored by the
National Committee for Natural Science Fund and the Beijing
Greencool Environmental Production Engineering Co. Ltd. will help
promote global ozone studies and the study of biological and
environmental changes in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The latest surveys have shown that the shrinking ozone layer
has become a global environmental problem in the past decade, with
the ozone content in atmosphere reduced by three to eight percent,
and the size of the hole in the ozone layer above the South Pole
has doubled. Chinese scientists have also found a thinner ozone
layer above the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the rapid reduction of the ozone layer will
increase the incidence rate of skin cancer and cataracts, and
cause great damage to animals and crops.

<HEADLINE> Chinese News Agency Asks Why Lee Teng-hui Is Running Rampant? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency, in a
commentary today, further exposes Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui's
true nature of indulging in separating Taiwan from the motherland
by quoting his August 10 remarks about worldwide commotion caused
by his earlier remarks on "state-to-state relations."
</P>
<P>
Lee described the confusion as "very good," saying "the worse
the results of the incident become, the better" he feels.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that Lee's recent remarks reveal to the
world his true nature and his deliberate attempt to sabotage cross-
straits relations, but he is meeting opposition from countries
around the world and has been strongly condemned by the Chinese,
including those on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lee was under great pressure and had to defend himself by
arguing that he had not mentioned "two states" but said "special
state-to-state relations" instead and has claimed that he is not a
trouble-maker and that there has been no change in Taiwan's "
mainland affairs policy."
</P>
<P>
However, the article asks, because Lee wants to separate Taiwan
from China, how can these explanations disguise his wild ambition?
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, anti-Chinese forces in the U.S. have
increased their activities, it says, with some people urging the U.
S. administration to sell more arms to Taiwan and others
advocating the drafting of a bill to strengthen the security of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The "two states" remark is the distillation of all Lee's plots
and his backers are international anti-Chinese forces, but as long
as he continues his "two states" remarks and doesn't return to the
basic "one China" policy, the Chinese will fight him.

<P>
TEHRAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran said it would use every
possible legal means to identify and punish those Taliban
militants responsible for the 1998 killing of Iranian diplomats
and reporter in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
Friday, Iranian Foreign Ministry's director for Afghan affairs,
Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian, said if the international community
fails to arrest and punish the "murderers," Iran would use
whatever legal tools available to punish them.
</P>
<P>
Eight Iranian diplomats and an IRNA correspondent were killed
when Taliban troops took over Mazar-i-Sharif, a stronghold of the
opposition Northern Alliance in August 1998. Iran has been
demanding identification and punishment of those responsible.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been supporting the opposition forces while Pakistan
backed the Taliban, which has won control over most of Afghanistan
in the civil war in the Middle Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Taherian said some of the killers have been identified, but he
did not mention how this was achieved.
</P>
<P>
He asked Afghan people to help Iran find and identify "all
culprits of the heinous crime."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official also said his country is for an
independent, free, and united Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bank Providing Settlement Services For Futures Traders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China (ICBC) announced today that it will provide more
services for futures traders.
</P>
<P>
A bank spokesman says that it has signed agreements with China'
s three futures exchanges in Shanghai, Zhengzhou, and Dalian to
help them handle capital settlements and will provide them and
traders with safe and fast capital settlement services nationwide
to minimize risks and ensure the healthy development of the
futures business.
</P>
<P>
Futures trading first started in new China in the early 1990s
and in 1998 the State Council issued a ruling on standardizing
markets. All of the country's 14 pilot futures exchanges were
subsequently merged into 3, and in 1998, their combined trading
volume was 3.75 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman says that the bank will help the exchanges
accelerate capital turnover, strengthen capital supervision, and
improve capital operating efficiency.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Marketing Institute Seeks Legal Backing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Institute of Marketing
(ZIM) is advocating for an Act of Parliament to regulate the
marketing profession in the country.
</P>
<P>
ZIM president Hapenga Kabeta said the institute had processed a
layman's draft of the Act and handed it to the Ministry of
Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
The Post, a Zambian newspaper, Friday quoted Kabeta as saying
that the law would include all marketing professionals but exclude
non professional people practising marketing.
</P>
<P>
"After the Act is passed it will become illegal for any company
to employ anyone other than marketing professionals registered
with ZIM," he said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said ZIM was advocating for the proposed Act to become law
by next year. The law would exclude non trained people from
practising marketing.
</P>
<P>
Kabeta said the marketing fraternity had not done well in
marketing Zambian products.
</P>
<P>
"Marketing has become more relevant in this liberalized economy
and the job of the marketer is to ensure their products are in the
mind of the consumers whenever they have to choose among a number
of goods," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ZIM board secretary Mapesa Musongole said Zambia
companies needed to invest more in market research in order to
know more about the markets they operated in.
</P>
<P>
He said although market research was expensive, it was
important for successful marketing.
</P>
<P>
"We also intend to introduce marketing ethics to give guidance
to all participants in the marketing sector, thereby regulating
things such as advertising and marketing consultancy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kabeta said ZIM would work on a marketing handbook for
reference purposes that would be relevant for the next century.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Ehud Barak hinted on Thursday night that the
defense budget of Israel may be cut. In a speech in northern
Israel, Barak said that Israel needs strength and confidence to
make the difficult decisions for peace. But he said a secure
Israel as a center for the Jewish people is the supreme goal.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Ehud Barak Thursday urged Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad to seize a "historic opportunity" to make peace
with Israel. Barak also said he believes that peace with Syria is
a prerequisite for a stable Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Six people, including a mother and her two children, were
killed Thursday night when the car they were driving collided
head-on with a bus in the northern Israel. Forty-two passengers
on the bus suffered light injuries in the accident.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Two agents of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency were
released by Cyprus on Thursday. The two men had been sentenced
five months ago to a three-year jail term. Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides said the suspension of the jail terms followed a
recommendation of clemency by his attorney-general and as a
goodwill gesture to the new Israeli government.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Maize Output Down by 25% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will register a 25-percent
drop in maize production this year, according to a latest report
by the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Only 1.7 million tons of maize will be harvested after this
year's long rains reason, representing a 20-percent reduction
from the 1991/1997 average output in the long rains season.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Friday quoted the ministry as saying
that even assuming a normal 1999/2000 October--February short
rains season, Kenya will face an estimated 500,000 tons deficit
between July this year and next June.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's third downward revision of its harvest
prediction has been attributed to substantive crop losses in the
crucial growing Nakuru District in central Kenya as well as in
other important grain-producing areas.
</P>
<P>
The government, the report said, has adopted the agricultural
ministry's recommendation that 180,000 tons of maize be imported
to cover the July- November deficit.
</P>
<P>
At the end of July, the Kenyan government announced to lower
duty levied on imported maize from 32.5 percent to 25 percent to
encourage grain traders for importing maize from outside.
</P>
<P>
The report said, additional maize imports would become
necessary after April next year, regardless of the quality of the
1999/2000 short rains season.
</P>
<P>
The maize deficit are mainly caused by poor rainfall during the
1998/ 1999 short rains seasons coupled with the continued absence
of rainfall during most of this year, the report noted.

<HEADLINE> Dialogue Should Lead to Solution of Kashmir Dispute: Pak PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Friday said that Pakistan's policy of dialogue with India
remains unchanged but said it must be meaningful, and should lead
to the resolution of the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
In his Independence Day message, the prime minister said that
it is obvious that without the resolution of the Kashmir dispute
"our region will remain afflicted with turmoil and peace and
stability will continue to elude South Asia."
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the Independence Day falling on August 14,
the prime minister said there have been many changes in the
political structure, the economy and the social characteristics of
Pakistan and its people during the past 52 years.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's WWI Veteran to Be Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's last surviving World
War I veteran, recognized for his service by France earlier this
year, will be awarded the rank of sub-lieutenant, the Bangkok Post
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Royal approval was being sought for the promotion of Yod
Sangrungruang, 101, who served as a private in the army during
World War I, as a token of appreciation for his devotion to the
country, the newspaper quoted Army Chief General Surayud Chulanont
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yod enlisted in the army and volunteered in 1917 to serve as
one of the 1,284 soldiers in the Royal Siamese Expeditionary Force
to fight with the Allies in France.
</P>
<P>
In 1918, the 19-year-old Yod served as a mechanic in the French
army, based near Marseilles.
</P>
<P>
On his return to Thailand in 1919, he received a military
decoration, the Victory Medal, bestowed by then King Rama VI.
</P>
<P>
After the disbanding of the expeditionary corps, he settled
down in his hometown in northern Phitsanulok province.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Yod, the only surviving member of the expeditionary
corps, was named as a good samaritan of the province.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, he was honored by the National War
Veterans Organization for his service in the army during World War
I and was awarded the Legion of Honor, chevalier grade, by France.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- American Pete Sampras

The top seed and last year's runner-up, Sampras extended his
winning streak to 19 matches with a hard-fought 7-5, 7-6 (7-2)
third-round victory over Germany's Rainer Schuttler.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Patrick Rafter of Australia and Russia's
Yevgeny Kafelnikov had an easier time with their third-round

prevailed.
</P>
<P>
The second-seeded Rafter dumped No. 15 Nicolas Lapentti of
Ecuador 6-2, 6-3. Kafelnikov, seeded fourth, beat American Chris
Woodruff 6-4, 6-4.
</P>

(7-3), 7-6 (7-5).
</P>
<P>
Seeking his fourth straight title, Sampras will face nemesis
Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands in the quarterfinals. A winner
of four straight matches over Sampras, the seventh-seeded Krajicek
breezed past American Justin Gimelstob 6-4, 6-2 tonight.
</P>
<P>
Fifth seed Tim Henman of Britain will face Kafelnikov in the
quarter-finals after beating No. 12 Nicolas Kiefer of Germany 6-4,
6-1.

United States cruised to a 6-2, 6-2 victory over Germany's Anke
Huber today to advance to the quarter-finals at the $520,000 Acura
Classic tennis event in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The top seed and defending champion is taking out her
frustration over losing the No. 1 ranking.
</P>
<P>
Seventh seed Barbara Schett of Austria also advanced when
Natasha Zvereva of Belarus retired in the second set with a
sprained right ankle. Schett lost the first set 6-2, and was

<P>
Davenport's next round opponent will be Conchita Martinez of
Spain, who beat Corina Morariu 7-5, 6-2.
</P>

over fourth seed Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain.
</P>
<P>
Less than a week ago, Davenport had to fight off Huber 7-5, 7-5

it was a different story today as Davenport stormed to victory in
50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Davenport improved to 19-2 in her last 21 matches in California,
with both of those defeats coming at the hands of sisters Venus
and Serena Williams.

<HEADLINE> Lamar Odom Signs with NBA Clippers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Multi-talented forward Lamar
Odom, the latest youngster tabbed as savior for the woeful Los
Angeles Clippers, today signed a three-year deal with the team
worth nearly $8.9 million.
</P>
<P>
Many believed Odom would be the first overall pick in the draft,
but a series of inexplicable moves seriously hurt his status. He
failed to show up for his physical examination and tried to re-
enter Rhode Island after hiring and firing an agent.
</P>
<P>
Under the collective bargaining agreement, Odom could receive a
three-year deal worth a maximum of $8.861 million, plus a club
option for a fourth year for more than $3.86 million.
</P>
<P>
Odom declared for the NBA draft on the last possible day,
forgoing his final two years of eligibility. He is a rare talent,
a player with size who can play on the wing. His dribbling skills
are exceptional.
</P>
<P>
Odom shot 48.2 percent from the field but only 33 percent from
3-point range and committed nearly as many turnover as assists.
</P>
<P>
With abilities that fit four positions, Odom played only one
season at Rhode Island but turned into the team's star, averaging
17.4 points, 9.4 rebounds and 3.8 assists as he led the Rams to
the NCAA Tournament. His regular season totlas helped him garner
first team All-Atlantic 10 Conference honors and Atlantic 10
Rookie of the Year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Export Earnings From Leather Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's export earnings from
the leather sector dropped by over 11 percent in the 1998-99
fiscal year ending on June 30 as compared with the previous fiscal
year, the Financial Express reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh earned 168.24 million U.S. dollars in 1998-99 by
exporting about 187 million square feet of leather as compared to
190.26 million dollars in the previous fiscal year, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The 1998-99 figure, which is 11.57 percent less than that for
1997-98, has fallen short of the target by 25.23 percent.
</P>
<P>
The leather sector's contribution to the country's total export
earnings, which remained static at around 6 percent over the last
few years, has also come down to 3.17 percent in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons behind the shortfall are a fall in prices in
the international market, stiff competition from Southeast Asian
countries and massive devaluation of their currencies in those
countries.
</P>
<P>
The total quantity of leather exported in 1998-99 was 61.24
million square feet up from the previous fiscal year, but the
value declined substantially due to a massive price fall in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
About 20 percent of the total leather export consists of
finished leather while the rest is crust being used as raw
material in importing countries.
</P>
<P>
Economic returns in terms of value addition in finished leather
production compared to crust are much higher. But the country
could not optimize its export earnings from the sector as more
than 60 percent of registered tanneries are either closed down or
inoperative due to lack of facilities required for finished
leather products.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh started exporting leather goods in 1990-91 and
earned 2.84 million U.S. dollars. After 7 years, the total
earnings from exports of leather and leather goods went up to
237.91 million dollars in 1997-98, covering 6.5 percent of the
country's total export earnings.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are over 200 tanneries employing about 65,000
people, and about 500,000 people are engaged in the leather trade.
The Bangladeshi government has already identified the sector as a
thrust of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh exports about 180 million square feet of finished
and crushed leather every year to major buyers like Italy, France,
Spain, Brazil, China and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Say Earth Calamity Not Very Likely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The prophecies about a great
calamity for human beings in 1999 are nothing but a fallacy,
according to scientists in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Predictions about a great calamity at the end of the 20th
century at least as far back as Nostredamus in the 16th Century,
according to Li Jing, a professor at the Chinese academy of
Sciences' Beijing Astronomical Observatory. Li told a forum
sponsored by the Chinese 2000 Year Committee and the Chinese
Academy of Sciences that in his book Nostredamus predicted 1,000
major historical events by the end of the 16th Century and the
great calamity, doomsday, was one of them.
</P>
<P>
He says that a Japanese man also wrote a book in the 1970s
saying that a large "planetary cross" would appear in the sky on
August 18, 1999 and could cause the great calamity predicted by
Nostredamus. A certain planetary alignment is to appear in space
on August 18 of this year, but not in the form of a planetary
cross, Li says, explaining that gravitational forces between
planets are very weak and are not strong enough to cause any
disasters on earth.
</P>
<P>
Some astronomical events can be related to natural disasters on
earth, but they could not in any way cause any great calamities,
according to Han Yanben, of the National Astronomical
Observatories. He says in addition that scientific awareness can
help human beings improve their ability to forecast or prevent
natural disasters, and that people should not believe fallacies
that are not backed by hard scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
Some people and organizations have used celestial phenomena to
support their fallacies, according to Ai Guoxiang, the head of the
National Astronomical Observatories, and scientists should try to
promote popular science and help people get rid of superstitious
beliefs.

<HEADLINE> Slum Dwellers Clash With Police in Bangladesh, 50 Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- At least 50 people, including two
policemen, were injured and over 100 vehicles were damaged in the
Bangladeshi capital Thursday during clashes between slum dwellers
and law-enforcing members, press reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The slum dwellers in Mohammadpur and Tejgaon thanas
(sub-districts) in the city came to the streets Thursday morning
to block roads in protest against the eviction of slums.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested eight slum dwellers for being involved in
damaging vehicles on the streets.
</P>
<P>
Many parts of the city turned into battlefields as the
law-enforcing agency personnel and the slum dwellers clashed.
Police charged baton, used water cannon and fired teargas to
disperse the demonstrators, who attacked the police with lethal
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Dwellers of about 40 slums under Mohammadpur thana, in the
western part of Dhaka, blocked all the roads and lanes of the
locality to force the government to put an end to the eviction
program, disrupting road communications in many parts of the city
for hours.
</P>
<P>
A rumor spread Wednesday night that the law-enforcing agencies
would evict all the slums in the city on Thursday as part of the
government initiative to clear the city of slums.
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 2 million slum dwellers in Dhaka, which
has a population of about 9 million.
</P>
<P>
The government started demolition of the city slums on Sunday
following the killing of a police constable in the city last
Friday. According to the government, the slums has become dens of
criminals who were responsible for drug and arms trafficking, and
other anti-social activities such as hijacking and toll extortion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bangladesh's High Court on Thursday extended its
stay order till August 19 which it issued Wednesday directing the
government not to remove any more slums in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The court passed the order Wednesday following the writ
petition filed by three non-governmental organizations and two
slum dwellers, challenging the legality and authority for
demolition of slums in the city and eviction of the inhabitants
without arranging alternative accommodation and without any prior
notice.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- China began yesterday using its
first waste gas treatment facility that uses technology from
Norway's electric giant ABB in Shenzhen, the first economic zone
in China.
</P>
<P>
The 200-million-yuan pollution treatment project is connected
to a 300,000 kw thermal power generator at the city's Western
Power Plant and uses seawater to eliminate sulfur dioxide from the
plant's waste gas. This helps remove 7,000 tons of pollutants
discharged by the plant annually without the use of other
chemicals and producing no residue.
</P>
<P>
The Pearl River Delta, which is near Shenzhen, has become the
victim of acid rain because of the large amount of sulfur dioxide
in the region's air. Acid rain causes several billion yuan worth
of damage to the region annually.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Cabinet Endorses Joint Research With U.S. on TMD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese cabinet on Friday
endorsed a plan to start joint technical research with the United
States on a U.S.-proposed anti-missile system, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The endorsement paved the way for the two countries to sign and
exchange diplomatic notes next Monday to start the joint research
on the theater missile defense (TMD) system.
</P>
<P>
Defense officials of the two countries are expected to exchange
a memorandum of understanding to stipulate in detail how to divide
up the research work between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum will cover only the first half of the five- or
six-year period for joint research, when the two countries will
focus on designing the equipment to be used in the TMD project,
such as infrared sensors to detect enemy missiles.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will exchange another memorandum of
understanding before moving into the next stage of research to
create trial products and test them.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo and Washington agreed last December to start this year
the joint research on the TMD, which is designed to protect the U.
S. and its allies from incoming ballistic missiles flying within a
3,000-kilometer radius.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will share an expected cost of 50 billion to
60 billion yen (439 million to 526 million U.S. dollars) for the
research, with Japan shouldering between 20 billion yen (175
million dollars) and 30 billion yen (263 million dollars).

<P>
JAKARTA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia will introduce a
new central bank regulation to set the minimum amount of foreign
exchange transfer that would be subject to compulsory reporting,
according local press reports.
</P>
<P>
"It will be introduced in one or two weeks time. But don't
interpret this wrongly. It is only aimed for the purpose of data
management and foreign exchange monitoring," Bank Indonesia deputy
governor Miranda S. Goeltom said.
</P>
<P>
Miranda declined to specify the minimum amount of foreign
exchange transfer that would be subject to compulsory reporting.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange monitoring system is deemed necessary to
help avoid a currency crisis, such as the one that hit the country
in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
The law on foreign exchange flow stipulates that every person
or legal entity within the country is required to inform banks, or
other parties appointed by Bank Indonesia, about the transfer or
flow of foreign currency or rupiah to or from the country when it
is above a certain amount.
</P>
<P>
The minimum transfer amount to require reporting would be set
by a central bank regulation.
</P>
<P>
Several Bank Indonesia officials have said that deciding on the
minimum amount is a challenge, pointing out that if the minimum
amount is set too low it would be cumbersome, but if it is set too
high many transactions would not be reported.
</P>
<P>
Miranda reaffirmed that Indonesia would not adopt a fixed
exchange rate system for the rupiah, due to a lack of foreign
currency reserves and huge overseas debt level.
</P>
<P>
"The burden of overseas debt is so heavy and the amount of
foreign exchange reserves is relatively small," Miranda was quoted
by The Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia's net foreign exchange reserves stood at around
16.2 billion U.S. dollars, while the country's total foreign debt
exceeds 150 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Several economists, including those from opposition parties,
had called for the need to fix the exchange rate of the rupiah to
the U.S. dollar in order to stabilize the local currency.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia abandoned its managed floating rate system in August
1997 and adopted a free float system in the wake of the currency
crisis that started in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah plunged to its lowest level of 17,000 rupiah to the
U.S. dollar last year, compared to 2,400 rupiah before the crisis
started.

<HEADLINE> Polo: A Popular Classical Chinese Sport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered a 1,000-year-old mural depicting people playing polo,
suggesting that the sport has not always been the sport of
privileged Westerners.
</P>
<P>
The mural, which was discovered in north China's Hebei province,
shows a man wearing peculiar trousers standing in front of a horse
and a child beside him holding two polo sticks.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists say that the theme of the mural is a bit unusual
but that the sport started in the 3rd century in China and became
popular among members of the imperial family. It was also used for
training in the army.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists say they believe that polo was introduced
from Central Asia into China through the Silk Road, but admit that
they don't understand why the sport lost its charm by the 17th
century.

COLOMBO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Over 100,000 representatives
from over 10,000 villages in Sri Lanka are to converge in Colombo
on August 29 to press for an early end to the civil war in the
north and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Friday by Dr. A.T. Ariyaratne, president of

delegates from all parts of the country will gather at a Colombo
park after a two-kilometer, meditational peace walk through

peace organizations and voluntary organizations will join the
walk.

<P>
Religious leaders will conduct their own religious rites and
bestow blessings on the initiative. Thereafter there will be a

The meditational walk and peace meditation aim to raise the
spiritual consciousness of people and thereby direct their minds
towards national unity and ending the terrors of violence and war,

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Learning More About China Through Language Studies (1) </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Nina, a 22-year-old graduate of
Nanjing University well remembers an encounter 6 years ago that
caused her to make a decision about her life, just after she came
to Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
She had come with her parents who are Russian and who came to
teach at the university. She couldn't speak a word of Chinese but
liked to ride around Nanjing by bus. Other passengers showed a
great deal of interest in her blonde hair but she couldn't
understand them and often got very upset. As a result, she swore
that she would learn the language and understand every word of it.
</P>
<P>
Not only did she learn to speak Chinese but she wrote a
graduate thesis on classical Chinese poetry and won the praise of
her tutors. She now want to be a teacher back home and to help the
Russians learn more about China.
</P>
<P>
Every year, about 400 foreign students come to Nanjing
University to study Chinese. The Chinese government has
established special groups for this purpose, with Chen Zhili, the
minister of education, at its head.
</P>
<P>
There is also a special Chinese language test for foreigners
and Ministry sources say that there has been a 20 percent increase
in the number of foreigners taking the test, which is referred to
as China's TOEFL. Last year, at least 40,000 foreigners took the
test and China now has test centers in 10 foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The test has been held annually since 1990. Zhao Guocheng, the
director of the Ministry of Education's Chinese language for
Foreign Students division, says that if a foreigner passes level 3
of the 11-level exam he or she can major in science and
engineering at an average-level college without taking another
language test.
</P>
<P>
But some key universities, like Beijing and Qinghua, require
foreigners to pass the level 6 before being accepted.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Criticizes Transnational Banana Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Foreign Trade
Minister Samuel Guzowski on Thursday criticized transnational
banana firms for unilaterally cutting the price paid to national
banana producers.
</P>
<P>
The firms made the decision at the end of last month to cut the
average producer pay by 20 cents to 5.83 U.S. dollars per box of
18.14 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Guzowski said the unilateral price cut has threatened about one
third of the 170 plantations registered in Costa Rica and put them
into difficult conditions to maintain production.
</P>
<P>
Three big transnational companies -- Del Monte, Chiquita and
Standard Fruit -- control banana trade in the world. They have
their own plantations in Costa Rica, but also buy fruit from small
and medium-sized national producers, according to an official of
Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
The firms attributed their price cut to the fall in fruit
prices in the United States and to the disputes with the European
Union over exports.
</P>
<P>
Banana sector generates 170,000 jobs in Costa Rica, which is
the second banana producer in the world. Last year it exported 116
million boxes of banana worth around 664 million dollars.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese woman whose height
of 2.33 m (7.645 feet) makes her the tallest woman in Asia and the
second-tallest in the world, is to undergo surgery to remove a
brain tumor.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Has Enough Reserves to Curb Financial Crisis: Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine has enough foreign reserves
to check the current crisis in the country's financial and oil
markets, which has dealt a serious blow to the faltering economy,
the government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued jointly with the central bank, the
government said the turmoil in the financial and oil markets has
affected the normal economic activities in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The government and the central bank have conducted regular
consultations with the representatives from the banking and oil
sectors and mapped out a series of measures to stabilize the
markets, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The government was strongly opposed to the monopolistic acts in
the oil market and the speculation in the financial market and
would use the monetary policy and foreign reserves to stabilize
the country's currency, the hryvnia, it said.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has been experiencing shortages of oil products since
mid-July, which led to a sharp rise in fuel and food prices.
</P>
<P>
The shortages made the already-depressed economic situation
even worse and seriously affected the harvest work in the rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
The crisis in the oil market also prompted the people to sell
the hryvnia for the U.S. dollar, leading to a quick fall of the
currency's value against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The hryvnia has fallen 20 percent against the dollar as of
August 10, well above the upper limit of the official trading band.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Launch Campaign Against Work-Related Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Brazil is launching a national
campaign against work-related accidents, chief of a national
workers' union announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This campaign, which emphasizes metallurgic and civil
construction sectors, is designed to give workers knowledge
regarding work-related accidents so that they may know how to
prevent them, said Moreira Fereira, President of Brazil's National
Confederation of Industry.
</P>
<P>
Moreira said Brazilian entrepreneurs must consider the money
used to prevent work-related accidents as investment and not cost.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 alone, work-related accidents and occupational diseases
caused a total loss of 5.8 billion U.S. dollars to Brazilian firms.
The largest number of accidents occurred among workers aged
between 20 to 29.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, labor accidents fell by 400 percent.
However, as many as 140,715 accidents occurred last year, in which
3,785 workers died and another 397,469 were injured.
