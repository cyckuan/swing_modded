JEROME L. GREENE DIES AT 93; MAJOR NEW YORK PHILANTHROPIST
</HEADLINE>
   (ms)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jerome L. Greene, a lawyer, real estate investor and
benefactor of Columbia Law School, Montefiore Medical Center and
the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, died May 27 at his
residence in the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan. He was 93 and also had
homes in Greenwich, Conn., and Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, whose family built a fortune through commercial and
residential real estate investments over more than six decades, was
a noted benefactor of Columbia Law School, from which he graduated
in 1928. He was a founding member of the law firm of Marshal,
Bratter, Greene, Allison &AMP; Tucker of Manhattan and a principal
owner of the Carlyle Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   A gift from Greene this year of more than $5 million enabled the
law school to complete renovations to its main building at 116th
Street and Amsterdam Avenue, as part of a $50 million construction
campaign. The building, was named Greene Hall in honor of the
donor. The renovations, scheduled for completion on Aug. 1, include
the creation of new faculty and administrative offices and a new
faculty library, lounge and conference rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Greene was chairman of the board of the Hirshhorn Museum at the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington and was a supporter of many
of New York's medical and cultural institutions. His gifts to
Montefiore Medical Center helped the construction of the Jerome L.
and Dawn Greene Medical Arts Pavilion and the Children's Hospital
of Montefiore Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-story Medical Arts Pavilion in the Norwood section of
the Bronx is the centerpiece of Montefiore's ambulatory care
network. ``This is a hospital with a social conscience, caring for
the poor and the underprivileged,'' Greene said at dedication
ceremonies on Oct. 3, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   His many philanthropic interests embraced the arts and included
the Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, WNET/Channel 13 and
the Juilliard School.
</P>
<P>
   ``His favorite composer was Mozart, so he underwrote the Mostly
Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center,'' said his wife, Dawn Greene.
``He loved those concerts.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Patricia
Humphrey of Concord, N.H.; a stepdaughter, Christina McInerney of
Manhattan, and two grandchildren. Another daughter of Greene's,
Cynthia-Sue Greene, predeceased him.

EIGHTH-GRADERS IN NEW YORK TO TAKE TURN AT NEW TESTS
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With students, educators, parents and elected
officials still smarting from the abysmal results on New York
state's new fourth-grade English test, thousands children across
the state will begin a new round of similar testing this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday and Wednesday, about 240,000 eighth-graders will take
the new language arts test, which for the first time goes beyond
multiple-choice answers and requires written essays in response to
questions about complex passages of literature, poetry and
nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday and Friday, they will be tested in math, which for
the first time will require them to explain in writing how they
arrived at answers. Each day's test will last about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   And if the fourth-grade English test was not challenging enough,
about 210,000 fourth-graders will be tested in math over three
days, beginning Wednesday, for 45 minutes a day.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mills, the state education commissioner who imposed the
new tests with the approval of the Board of Regents, and schools
Chancellor Rudy Crew urged test takers not to be disheartened by
results released last week. Two-thirds of the city's 75,000
fourth-graders failed to meet strict new reading and writing
standards. Statewide, about half the pupils passed the test, which
was administered in January.
</P>
<P>
   The scores prompted a loud public outcry from elected officials,
including New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who called for the
ouster of principals at poorly performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   But Mills emphasized that the higher standards were important.
``Youngsters who are going to be taking the tests need to know that
this is designed to help,'' he said. ``Everyone wants them to be
able to read and write well and know a lot of math. We need to know
how much they know. They should relax and know that the adults will
take care of the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The adults in at least one of the city's 32 districts, however,
appeared more nervous than the students.
</P>
<P>
   When a classroom of eighth-graders at Roberto Clemente
Intermediate School in District 5 in Harlem announced that they
were not nervous, the principal, Aura Rivera, piped up with a laugh
to announce that she was. District 5 is one of the lowest
performing districts in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do well, I do well,'' Ms. Rivera said to the students,
who only moments before were hovering over sample English tests.
``We'll know we're doing our jobs and that you're ready for high
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxim Daniels, 14, a tall, athletic-looking boy dressed in a
white jersey and baggy jeans, explained that he was calm because he
was well prepared. He was one of about 100 eighth-graders at the
school who participated in two-hour after-school programs to
prepare for the test. The sessions, which began in November and
ended last week, met from 2:45 to 4:45 p.m. on Tuesdays, Wednesdays
and Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We read and talk about writing,'' Maxim said. ``We talk about
how we're supposed to write beginnings and conclusions, discuss the
purpose of writing and talk about the importance of understanding
what we're reading.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you know what's important?'' Ms. Rivera asked,
referring to passages like the ones that will be on the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first two sentences have some very important facts in
them,'' Maxim said, prompting Ms. Rivera to applaud. ``But you
don't tune out after that, because the other sentences have
supporting details.''
</P>
<P>
   The new test is full of concepts like ``supporting details,''
``the main idea'' and ``topic sentences.'' The old test simply
required students to read short passages and fill in missing words.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare students for the test, the school stepped up teacher
training in reading and math, Ms. Rivera said. The school focused,
in part, on diagramming stories and mathematical problems, which is
similar to sentence diagramming in that it picks something apart,
to help students' comprehension, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Results from the test will not affect a student's promotion to
the next grade this year because scores will not be released until
September, said Roseanne DeFabio, the state's assistant
commissioner for curriculum, instruction and assessment. Instead,
eighth-grade promotion will depend on grades, citywide test scores
and attendance, she said. The fourth-grade English scores will not
be used to fail students this year, either, but Crew has said that
the test will be one of several criteria next year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even before the release of the fourth-graders' test results,
educators had not expected high scores. Historically, students have
performed poorly on newly imposed standardized tests, especially
those with higher standards, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-grade test, created by CTB/McGraw-Hill, was developed
to set new, higher standards for reading and writing in an effort
to help prepare children for graduation requirements being phased
in during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   A model being closely watched by educators across the country,
the test reflects standards and a curriculum developed by
committees of teachers in the last several years.

HOMEOWNERS GROUPS UNDER THE GUN ON CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS FISCUS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ When a Phoenix man was shot in the back at a party, he
believed the shooter wasn't the only one to blame. He successfully
sued the condominium association where it happened, saying it knew
there was a need for added security.
</P>
<P>
   Another Phoenix association now is being sued after its added
security backfired.
</P>
<P>
   If a gang known for crime routinely hangs out in a common area
but a homeowners association cuts back on security to save money,
can it be sued if there is a crime? Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Valley of the Sun, as the Phoenix area is known, and
across the country, community associations are vogue. But when
crime happens on their turf, these groups are becoming targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courts all across the country are starting to hold community
associations liable,'' says Beth Mulcahy, a Phoenix attorney who
represents more than 150 community associations _ which include
planned communities, condo communities and homeowners associations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``And when I say liable, I'm talking to the tune of $10
million, $5 million, $500,000 for inadequate security.''
</P>
<P>
   A Manhattan woman was grabbed in her condo complex, taken to the
rooftop and attacked. She sued the complex for $15 million, saying
security was lax.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas woman raped in her complex sued her association and
received $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts firm Liability Consultants Inc. examined nine
years of recent lawsuits against community associations and the
like. The average jury verdict for inadequate security: $3.35
million. The average out-of-court settlement: $546,000.
</P>
<P>
   GROUPS HAVE A DUTY
</P>
<P>
   ``Associations have a duty to keep their properties safe,'' she
said. ``Are you taking steps to increase security? Are you
proactive? If you knew there was a rape, did you notify the
membership?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No'' is a common answer to those questions for many
associations, she says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Some associations are getting the message. And insurance
policies. And legal advice.
</P>
<P>
   The courts ``definitely woke up a lot of communities,'' says
Mike Mielke, a member of the local Community Association Institute.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Boards of 10 or 15 years ago, they worked from emotion and
basically shot from the hip. Today, the boards have to be more
sophisticated, do more research . . . and they have to get legal
opinions. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Are there transients, are there drug problems? Even if you
hire a security guard, is that enough? A situation where an
association hires a guard then stops using him and something
happens, can that come back to haunt you?''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, the Arizona Supreme Court made what Mulcahy
calls a landmark decision regarding an association's responsibility
to make common areas reasonably safe.
</P>
<P>
   The case was ``Martinez V. Woodmar IV Condominiums Homeowners
Association.'' &QL; 
PARTY GUEST SHOT &QL; 
Carlos Martinez was a guest at a party. During the party, Martinez
and two others went to the parking lot to check on their cars and
found gang members around one of the cars. There was an altercation
and as Martinez ran away, he was shot in the back.
</P>
<P>
   The condominium association employed a security guard who
patrolled the area, and he usually dispersed the gang members. But
the Martinez shooting happened about an hour before the guard came
on duty.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez sued, saying the association knew gangs were using the
parking lot for drug deals and other crimes and had been warned
about the need for more security. The Arizona Supreme Court ruled
that an association must maintain common areas to make them
reasonably safe and to take reasonable steps to prevent danger on
the land it controls.
</P>
<P>
   There are no other reported cases so far in Arizona dealing with
the security liability issue, says attorney Curtis Ekmark, who
specializes in community associations.
</P>
<P>
   Ekmark is defending an association in a case that he says
illustrates the problems Arizona groups are having in dealing with
the ``Martinez'' ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kester v. Vista de Oeste'' is pending in Arizona's Maricopa
County Superior Court. &QL; 
RISKS OF ADDED SECURITY
</P>
<P>
   Vista de Oeste is a &UR; west Phoenix townhouse complex that hired
off-duty police officers for added security. Ekmark said one of the
association member's kids aimed a laser pointer at the officers;
unsure if it was a weapon, the officers pulled their guns and
detained the child at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The association now is being sued for emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   If there weren't off-duty police used, ``then people would
complain that there was not enough security,'' says Ekmark, a
partner in the law firm Ekmark and Ekmark. The association hired
the off-duty police, ``but then they get sued.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the problems are in low-income areas, he adds, ``and
those are the associations that don't have the money'' for added
security measures. ``It's not that they don't care. It's that they
don't have the money to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a question of where to draw the line.
</P>
<P>
   DIG A MOAT &QL; 
``Do you put a moat and machine-gun turret around the complex?''
Ekmark asked. ``A lot of associations are trying to come to grips
with `Martinez.' '' &QL; 
Community associations are non-profit corporations governed by
individual members elected by their peers. People automatically
become members when purchasing a home in the association.
</P>
<P>
   Mulcahy recommends that the associations take steps such as
adding electronic gates or surveillance cameras, or using security
patrols and screening employees for criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   She also recommends that board members not misrepresent the
level of security that exists, and that they notify residents if
problems occur.
</P>
<P>
   The court rulings have struck a nerve with community
associations, Mielke says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more talk today about thefts, drugs, muggings, rapes.
Now, I've seen committees formed to talk about it, about using
off-duty police, about notifying the neighborhood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Says Phil Zeni, former president of the Montiel Homeowners
Association near 16th Street and Glendale Avenue, ``Anytime there
was anything minor, we got on the phone and called everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   They also trimmed back trees and bushes, started newsletters and
crossed their fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this litigious society, anybody who has more than $25 can
go file a lawsuit and decide they can try to take away the net
worth of anybody that's on their radar screen,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Associations have to walk carefully, he says, because any
decision ``can come back to haunt you.'' &QL;

A MODERATE MONTH OF MAY FOR THE NEW YORK REGION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Has it been your sense that this has been an
extraordinary month of May, an uncommon string of lovely days and
delightful nights capping a spring of phenomenal pleasantness?
</P>
<P>
   You're right.
</P>
<P>
   And wrong.
</P>
<P>
   It has been awfully nice. But according to Stephen Fybish, a
free-lance weather statistic fanatic who lives on the Upper West
Side, the most striking thing about this month has been its
normality.
</P>
<P>
   How moderate was it? Well, until a trio of sultry days arrived
in town for the Memorial Day weekend, the temperature had been
within five degrees of normal every day of this month, Fybish
reported. When the mercury in Central Park reached 85 on Saturday
(it hit 88 Sunday), it was the latest in the year that the
temperature had first topped 80 since 1928.
</P>
<P>
   You want to talk frighteningly pleasant? There were only seven
days with measurable rainfall this month, the fewest since 1970,
Fybish said. But it has not been dangerously dry. In fact, total
rainfall for the month _ 4.04 inches, most of which fell on just
two days _ is just about average.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University,
agreed with Fybish's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you get a month that's average as a result of
extremes,'' Gadomski said. ``This May has tended to not stray
awfully far off the mark. It has been just about as benign a month
as you could ask for this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   April, by comparison, was lousy. Despite 12 rainy days, there
were only 1.93 inches of rain last month, the third-lowest amount
since 1963. No fun for either the farmer or the sun worshiper.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's miniature heat wave, a sort of last-minute
browning to caramelize the month's sweetness, will continue for at
least another day or two, Gadomski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time Tuesday and Wednesday roll around, it will be
sufficiently moist that the specter of afternoon thunderstorms will
start to enter the forecast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fybish is hoping for a high of at least 85 Monday. If that
happens, he said, it will be the first time in the relatively short
history of Memorial Day weekends that the temperature topped 85
degrees on all the days. ``Whatever this month has had, it managed
to wind up on a positive note,'' he said. ``There's a lot of
emotional investment in that.''

THE BIG CITY: THE TOURISTS ARE REPLACED BY REFUGEES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After two months of NATO bombing, the National
Tourism Organization of Serbia remains unbowed. It still maintains
a Web site offering cheery exhortations like, ``Come! In Serbia
something's always at the height of the season.'' The English is
not always perfect _ ``Roam through Serbia! You won't loose your
way'' _ but the enthusiasm is unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although more than 40 different nations live in Serbia, they
do have some things in common _ their homes are wide open to
friends,'' the tourist agency explains. ``Wherever you go in the
country painted in heart, large quantities of openheartedness and
smile are served, free of charge. Let's not forget something else.
In a Serb home, the best room, the largest slice of bread and the
kindest word have always been reserved for the guest or weary
traveler.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words inspired a disgusted sigh from Muzafere Beka on
Friday afternoon in the Bronx. ``Serbia is a factory of lies,'' she
said, sitting at her desk during another quiet day at the Kosova
Travel Agency. Kosova is the Albanian term for Kosovo, the native
soil of Mrs. Beka and many of her neighbors in the Albanian enclave
near Pelham Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs' homes are always open?'' she said. ``Yes, you stay
with them, you eat with them, you drink with them _ then they stab
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily at this time of year, Mrs. Beka would not have time
to contemplate tourist propaganda. She would be too busy booking
flights home for Albanian expatriates. ``This should be our high
season,' she said. ``In the summer, parents take their children
home to see relatives and learn about their heritage. But this year
_ nothing. No one goes to Kosova, of course. Everyone is running
out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Beka, who is 45, made her exit 13 years ago. ``To tell you
the truth, I just got sick and tired of the Serbs,'' she said. ``If
you are not their kind of people, you cannot remain. My husband and
I saw there was no future for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Abandoning her career as a civil engineer in Kosovo, Mrs. Beka
moved to the Bronx and worked for six years as a cleaning woman.
``Seven days a week I did work, in the day cleaning apartments, in
the evening cleaning garbage at offices,'' she said. ``I don't know
what welfare is. I never used this country. God bless America.
Nobody in America ever said, `You are Albanian, you cannot do that
job.'''
</P>
<P>
   The earnings helped send her two daughters to college and
provide start-up capital for the travel agency. The business grew
by catering to Albanians living in the Bronx and in the Glendale
section of Queens, where there was another office. It was managed
by her husband, Bashkim, who had been a doctor in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Then once again their careers fell victim to Serbian-Albanian
tensions. Business fell off so much in the last year that the
Queens office was closed several months ago, and Mrs. Beka is not
sure how much longer she can afford to keep open the Bronx office,
at 782 Lydig Avenue. But she doesn't like to discuss these
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ashamed to be mentioning business when people are
dying,'' she said. ``First we worry about these Albanian people who
are refugees. Their life is hell.'' Mrs. Beka is expecting some
refugees this week: 10 relatives, who will be moving in with the
six people already living in their three-bedroom, one-bathroom
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God they got out,'' she said. ``We still don't know
anything about my brother's son. He and his wife were in
Montenegro. If the Serbs did anything to them. ...'' Mrs. Beka's
eyes misted for a moment. Then she lighted a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm smoking two, three packs a day,'' she said. ``I don't
sleep until 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning. There is so much to
think about: my family there, my family here, the political
situation there, the business here. I try not to worry. I tell my
kids when anything in life approaches you, you cannot stop and cry.
You have to fight.''

FIGHTING A DIFFERENT BATTLE, AGAINST FIRE INSTEAD OF CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It takes courage to stare down a suspect with a gun.
Does it take a different but equally impressive burst of bravery to
storm into a tenement awash in flames?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not why Brian Connolly, a highly decorated 11-year
police veteran who had risen to the rank of sergeant, says he
traded in his holster for a hose earlier this month and became a
firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I always wanted, from the time I was a kid,''
said Connolly, who remembers the neighborhood firehouse, Engine Co.
308 on Lefferts Boulevard in Queens, as one of the hearths of his
childhood. ``Even when we were little, they were good to us. They
used to fix our bikes.''
</P>
<P>
   John Marsich, a firefighter with Ladder Co. 29 in the South
Bronx, spent 12 years as a patrolman before choosing a new job
three years ago, in part because he was disappointed with his old
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the police department, you can get jammed up for
anything,'' said Marsich, 35, who had patrolled two Bronx precincts
and left on good terms. ``You never got an `attaboy.' But you
always heard about it if you screwed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly and Marsich are two of the 339 police officers, some of
them veterans with more than 10 years on the force, who have moved
over to the fire department in the last four years. Thirty-one
people, roughly 21 percent, of the 150 who graduated from the Fire
Academy with Connolly this month are former police officers,
including another sergeant. Connolly took a $15,000-a-year pay cut
to make the career change.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, police officers have migrated to the fire
department for an armload of different reasons, city officials
said. It happens in cycles, they said, and the cycle is on an
upswing. Three years ago, for example, the percentage of former
police officers in Fire Academy classes ran as low as 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For many police officers accustomed to the grind of a five-day
work week, the chief attraction of the firefighting life is the
opportunity to work 24-hour tours and have longer stretches of time
off.
</P>
<P>
   But several firefighters said they were also motivated by a
feeling that they had been unappreciated as police officers, often
suffering blame as a group for individual incidents, like the
shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed man killed by police officers
in February.
</P>
<P>
   As firefighters, they said they felt admired again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have continued on happily in the police department for
20 years,'' said Robert Mahon of Ladder Co. 35 in Manhattan, who
left the police force two years ago. ``I wasn't running away from
it, but I felt like the public was very reactionary. Whenever a
police officer did something, all 30,000 cops were affected, and
you would have to listen to the public sentiments as if it was you
who did it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to measure how many officers are interested in
moving to the fire department, because the city does not track the
number who take the fire test. It records only the number who are
ultimately hired, so it is hard to say whether more officers are
now interested in firefighting jobs or just better at securing
them.
</P>
<P>
   But firefighters say interest has increased. Michael Carter, a
vice president with the Uniformed Firefighters Association,
estimated that almost every fire company in the city has three or
four police veterans. In one South Bronx firehouse shared by Engine
Co. 45 and Ladder Co. 58, there are 15 former police officers among
the 50 firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first question you are asked when you come through that
door as a probie,'' a probationary firefighter, ``is, `Are you an
ex-cop?''' said Thomas Dunn, who spent five years on the police
force and has been a firefighter for 10.
</P>
<P>
   Ranking police officers who make the switch can suffer cuts in
pay, as Connolly did. But patrolmen who make the move receive the
same salary, because of the pay parity between the two departments.
They also retain all their seniority and pension benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Several former police officers said they were drawn to the fire
department by a sense of teamwork that they had found missing in
the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Marsich said he noted the difference after a serious fire in the
Bronx several years ago where the firefighting effort had not gone
smoothly. A gas line exploded, and several firefighters, he said,
were blown down a flight of stairs and onto the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``A two-star chief came into quarters and everyone spoke openly
about what they would have done differently,'' he recalled. ``In
the police department, there was a saying: `Loose lips sink ships.'
People would never own up to a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, like most of the men who have fought both fires and crime,
said they required equal doses of daring. But Dunn, who has
received medals for valor in both jobs, noted that it was not
always the same type of courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear as a cop is your enemy,'' he said. ``You need to react.
On the fire department, fear can be your friend, because it can
help you have respect for the situation you are going into.''

INDY IS DAMAGED GOODS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's edition of The Sporting Muse, which never runs out of
gas:
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has run out of gas sometime in their driving career,
but that doesn't mean everyone knows how Robby Gordon felt Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Indy 500 remains racing nirvana for most drivers, so to lead
the race with mere laps remaining and then have the car go silent
for a lack of fuel is the epitome of exasperation. Especially when
you've hurdled as many barriers as Gordon has.
</P>
<P>
   The Cerritos-born Gordon, an off-road driving champ as a
teenager, finished third at the Long Beach Grand Prix in 1994 and
followed that with a fifth at Indy. In 1995, he won his first two
CART races and finished fifth again at Indy. He had every reason to
believe he'd have several more opportunities to improve on those
fifths.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the last Indy race featuring the Championship Auto
Racing Teams (CART) drivers. The snit between the driving teams and
Speedway President Tony George -- George essentially locked out the
major racing teams and started his own circuit featuring what
ostensibly are replacement drivers -- has soiled the 500 and forced
a lot of drivers, like Gordon, into painful corners.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon stayed true to CART in 1996 but suffered a subpar season.
In 1997, he jumped to the NASCAR circuit except for two open-wheel
races -- Indy, where his car and suit caught fire, and the
inaugural Fontana CART race, where he finished eighth. He returned
to CART at mid-season in 1998 and drove well.
</P>
<P>
   But the Indy pull was strong enough for Gordon and several old
racing friends to create their own team for 1999. As the only
owner-driver on the circuit, he eliminated the either-or policy
that vexes other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   An Indy win Sunday would have been an amazing achievement of
racing independence for someone who never runs away from
challenges. Perhaps that explains why he said that Sunday's result
was more crushing than 1997, when he suffered major burns on his
legs. ...
</P>
<P>
   For the millions who watch one auto race a year, the Indy 500 is
still fine entertainment. But considering the growth of auto racing
the last decade, Indy is soiled goods.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR has become a sports monster and the best open-wheel
drivers run CART. The Indy Racing League created by George is like
AAA baseball. There will always be driving errors and crashes in
the sport, but those at the Indy 500 are borne of inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   There were two major pit accidents at Indy Sunday. Eli Salazar,
as an example, has crashed in three of his four Indy 500 starts as
an IRL regular. There was more driving and less racing at Indy
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Foyt's return to the winner's circle as a team owner was a
beneficent moment for Indy. But how many people watching knew it
was somewhat hollow, that Foyt was one of the few names in racing
who cast his lot with George? ...
</P>
<P>
   The choice of cheering for the Pacers or the Knicks was an easy
one. How insufferable will New Yorkers be should their team go from
eighth in the eight-team Eastern Conference draw to the finals?
</P>
<P>
   But there's a second good reason to favor the Pacers. An
appearance in the finals would give former UCLA star Reggie Miller
some of the recognition that has evaded him over a 12-year career.
</P>
<P>
   The spindly and mouthy Miller has been one of the league's
premier shooters during an era where shooting has become a lost
art. He's the NBA's career leader in three-point shots taken and
made, he stands fifth among active players in points, and he's
playing in his fourth Eastern Conference final in the last six
years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Reggie has only been named to four all-star games, and has
been a third-team all league choice just three times. Coming into
this season, Miller had missed just 20 games due to injury over 11
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana lost all three of those previous Eastern Conference
finals in seven games, and each seventh game came on the road. This
is the first time Indy can count on game seven being at home
(although they already blew one home game with Sunday's loss).
</P>
<P>
   Miller's career has always been star-crossed. He was a prep star
in Riverside, but it took him awhile to sneak out from under the
shadow of his sister, Cheryl.
</P>
<P>
   His college days came during one of the funkier eras of Bruin
basketball. The Bruins lost seven of their last 11 games in 1984,
his freshman season. In 1985, the Bruins failed to beat USC at
least once for the first time since 1942. They won the NIT, but
that was a rather ignominious achievement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Miller averaged 25.9 points a game, second all-time in
UCLA lore to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. But the Bruins saw their 52-game
winning streak against Cal get snapped, and then they lost in the
first round of the NIT to UC Irvine. In 1987, Miller and the Bruins
won the Pac-10 but lost in the second round of the NCAA tournament
to Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The Miller of today looks, acts and plays just like the Miller
of UCLA, only with more confidence in his shot and more diligence
on defense. It would be nice to see Miller get a shot in the
finals. ...
</P>
<P>
   It might be time for a recount of the NBA's Top 50, named during
the league's 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Of the ten active players named in '96, six have not won a NBA
title. Only two of those six are still playing in '99, David
Robinson and Patrick Ewing. Three of the other four aren't likely
to get another shot (Charles Barkley, Karl Malone and John
Stockton). Shaquille O'Neal, alas, will have many.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 40 retired players named to that roster, only four failed
to win a title -- Dave Bing, George Gervin, Pete Maravich and Nate
Thurmond. Lenny Wilkens didn't win a title as a player but won one
as a coach. Elgin Baylor started the 1972 title season with the
Lakers but retired early in the season because of injuries. He got
a ring.
</P>
<P>
   The placement of Shaq and Robinson on the team looks specious
now, especially when you consider some of the fellows who won
multiple titles -- Joe Dumars, Dennis Rodman (five rings), Dennis
Johnson (titles with two different teams) and Horace Grant (four
finals appearances). ...
</P>
<P>
   Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy looks like he last slept in 1993.
I'd say the Phil Jackson rumors are affecting him, but he looked
like that when he got the Knicks job. ...

PATAKI NAMES BADILLO, CRITIC OF CUNY, AS ITS CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gov. George Pataki has named Herman Badillo, a sharp
critic of the the City University of New York and a primary force
behind efforts to change it, as its next chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment gives Badillo, 69, a lawyer who has been CUNY's
vice chairman and a close ally of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the
opportunity to shape one of New York City's most important
educational institutions, one with 200,000 students, at a time of
enormous ferment. He will also be able to fill many top positions
that are now open at the university and its 17 undergraduate
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Like many public urban universities, CUNY draws many students
who are not viewed as prime college material: welfare mothers,
immigrants who speak little or no English, students from inner-city
neighborhoods who have little to show for their high school years.
</P>
<P>
   And at a time of budget cutting and a renewed focus on
standards, the education of these students has become a hotly
debated issue.
</P>
<P>
   Many CUNY traditionalists say that the university must not
abandon its mission to admit all students and try to help them. But
Badillo and other critics, including the mayor and governor, have
long accused CUNY of squandering its resources on weak students who
never graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question in my mind that CUNY needs reform,''
Pataki said in a telephone interview Sunday. ``Herman Badillo has a
knowledge of the system, he's a product of the system and he has a
vision for the system. That all made it plain that he's the man to
reform CUNY.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve that reform, CUNY's critics say, the university must
set higher admissions standards to encourage applicants to work
harder in high school, push students to complete remedial work and
earn degrees more quickly, and establish tougher requirements for
graduation so that a CUNY degree will be more respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure that the value of the City University
diploma is accepted anywhere in New York City or the world,''
Badillo said. ``That is my goal.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics of Badillo's efforts to transform CUNY expressed
alarm at his appointment, which was first reported Sunday in The
New York Daily News, and said it would result in further disarray.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the fox guards the chickens, you don't expect to have
anything left except skin and bones,'' said Sandi E. Cooper a CUNY
history professor and former chairwoman of its faculty senate.
</P>
<P>
   Edward C. Sullivan, chairman of the state Assembly's Committee
on Higher Education, called the appointment an insult. ``The CUNY
board is in chaos, so why would the governor want to reward the
purveyor of chaos?'' he ased.
</P>
<P>
   And Robert Hollander, a CUNY graduate student and adjunct
professor, said he viewed Badillo as ``CUNY's worst enemy,''
someone who did not appreciate CUNY's mission to provide both
access and excellence to students.
</P>
<P>
   Badillo said his intention was not to harm the university, but
to improve it. ``I have no desire to curtail its traditional
function as a gateway for the poor, but to do it even better,'' he
said.

RESIDENT RETURNS HOME TO THE BLOODY AFTERMATH OF A DEADLY
STANDOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELLIS E. CONKLIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHORELINE, Wash. _ His eyes red and stinging from lingering tear
gas fumes, Fred Westphal Sunday pointed to the blood-soaked sheets
crumpled on his son's bed.
</P>
<P>
   It was near that bed, he said, that 21-year-old Lonnie Davis
stood Friday afternoon, gasping for breath through a shattered
window as he made his last furious stand before a police sniper
killed him with a single bullet to the head.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Westphal returned for the first time to the four-bedroom
home he's rented for the past 11 years. He came to collect a few
personal belongings, clothes for the next few days, favorite items
for the children. He came to look for a family pet, a black
Scottish Terrier, which fled the house and cannot be found.
</P>
<P>
   But even late Sunday afternoon, two days after the shootout,
Westphal could not stay inside the home for more than a few minutes
without having to step outside for fresh air. Fumes from the tear
gas police fired into the house cling to the rugs and draperies,
and seem to have permeated the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place is uninhabitable,'' Westphal whispered as he sipped
from a can of 7-Up and gathered up some clothing for his wife and
three sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can live here any longer. We'll never live here
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The walls are riddled with bullets, some of them fist-sized
punctures where the tear gas cannisters came blasting in last
Friday before the nearly six-hour-long standoff came to a fatal
end.
</P>
<P>
   Blood is smeared on the white linoleum kitchen floor where glass
is scattered. Some of those shards have come to rest atop the
unwashed breakfast dishes. There is more blood in the hallway where
family photographs hang askew.
</P>
<P>
   Ransacked drawers and overturned tables are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The pale green walls of a child's bedroom are smeared with red.
</P>
<P>
   A cool afternoon breeze flows through the dozens of holes in the
sliding glass doors looking out on a wooden deck. The glass shower
stall is in a thousand pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' rampage began at about noon Friday at his family's home
in Brier, where Brier police say he fatally stabbed his mother,
Shelia Lindsey, 46, and 18-month old nephew Kahari Prince with a
small kitchen knife.
</P>
<P>
   He fled in his mother's car, smashed into a motorcyclist on
Interstate 5 and scaled a retaining wall, ending up in Westphal's
quiet, tree-lined neighborhood. There, he killed 63-year-old Erma
Spence with a garden hoe as she worked in her yard and seriously
injured 82-year-old Irene Hilton before barricading himself inside
Westphal's home. Hilton was in serious condition yesterday with a
broken neck.
</P>
<P>
   The nighmarish day began for Westphal as he turned his car
toward home about 3:15 p.m. Friday, tired from a day on the Boeing
777 production line in Everett. Police turned him away at Fifth
Avenue and Northeast 195th Street, just a few blocks from his house
in the 19000 block of Seventh Avenue Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal was not listening to the radio and had no idea what was
going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd go pick up my 10-year-old and we'd go out for
ice cream or something,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   But he would quickly discover that his 10-year-old was one of
400 North City Elementary School students who had been kept at the
school as the shootout unfolded just across the freeway from the
Westphal home.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal went to find a pay phone and called his wife at work to
tell her that police were everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something's going on in our neighborhood,' I told her. She was
watching the news. She just told me to turn on the TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed, he went to a nearby friend's house to find out where
his 14- and 16-year-old boys were. He was relieved to learn they
had gone to a friend's home in Richmond Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``So at least I knew all the children were accounted for.''
</P>
<P>
   At 4 p.m., Westphal watched the standoffunfold on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were all these helicopters circling around and showing
my house, and I said, `That's my house!' Then the thought hit me _
I have guns! So I called 911 and said, `There are guns in there.
Get your officers out of the way.'''
</P>
<P>
   Before it was over, Davis fired dozens of rounds from those
guns. Police found nearly two dozen bullet holes in two police
cars. A King County sheriff's deputy Diana Russell, suffered a
fractured skull after being hit with flying glass during the
standoff. She was in satisfactory condition Sunday at Harborview
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal stressed Sunday that he's a gun collector only.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a gun nut and I'm not into the militia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were eight guns, all of them in Westphal's bedroom and out
in the open. There was also 150 rounds of ammunition, Westphal
said. Some of the guns included a .45-caliber semiautomatic
handgun, a 20-gauge shotgun, and one 12-gauge shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   After Westphal called 911, police ordered him to immediately
come to the Shoreline Command Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight, it was a mistake (to leave the guns out in full
display),'' Westphal said. ``I should have completely disabled
those guns.''
</P>
<P>
   But Westphal quickly added that he never worried about the
potential dangers, even with three sons in the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids have all fired them and they know about the damage
they can do, and that they're not toys,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   At about 11:30 p.m. Friday, after the ordeal had been over for
hours, Westphal was permitted to come to the house to pick up his
dogs. He found his dachshund and the fox terrier hiding in the back
yard, but couldn't find his 8-year-old Scottish terrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea where he is. We need help in finding him.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal said his boys are all traumatized and are staying with
friends. He and his wife plan to spend the next few days with
Westphal's father in West Seattle while they try to find another
place to rent.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal said he's tried with no avail to find his landlord and
tell him what happened, and that he's moving out.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm not sure anyone can live here again,'' Westphal said.

CHAYANNE: A SLICK PACKAGE, A LIMITED VOICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To many of his new fans it seems that Ricky Martin,
the Puerto Rican pop sensation, came out of nowhere. He didn't. He
is simply the English-speaking point man for a Latin pop-star
system that has long been manufacturing hits and stealing hearts
across the Spanish-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   Chayanne, one of Martin's rivals, brought his own stage
spectacle to the Theater at Madison Square Garden on Friday night.
Tall, dark and square-jawed with a boyish smile, Chayanne sang and
danced through a decade's worth of hits, with excerpts from his
video clips projected overhead.
</P>
<P>
   His songs, unsurprisingly, are vows of love: love that
overpowers him, desire that spikes his adrenaline, passion that
could make him sacrifice everything. He pleads for a kiss, for a
caress, for just a glance. Onstage, the women are more accessible
than they are in the songs; two blonde dancers twirled into his
arms and lingered for some bump and grind.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old Chayanne has spent the last 20 years as an
entertainer, first with Los Chicos, a Puerto Rican teen-age vocal
group, and then in a thriving solo career. He drew notice outside
that Latin world as the lead, opposite Vanessa L. Williams, in the
1998 film ``Dance With Me''; he also recorded a duet with her. But
he is not pitching himself to the U.S. mainstream yet. On Friday he
spoke English for just a few moments.
</P>
<P>
   Chayanne's generation of Latin pop singers is internationalist,
not letting traditionalism or local pride turn away potential hit
songs. He'll take a groove or a melody from anywhere: plena from
Puerto Rico, zouk from Martinique, axe from Brazil, merengue from
the Dominican Republic. And his band is equally capable of playing
a guajira or a power ballad. In ``Solamente Tu Amor'' Chayanne
could have been a Spanish-speaking George Michael; in ``Mira Ven
Ven'' the band fused blues-rock with mambo.
</P>
<P>
   As a singer, Chayanne is limited; his voice is sweet but
shallow, and he shows no inclination to improvise. But his job is
to put a pleasing face on a slick pop package, and on Friday the
shrieks that greeted every twitch of Chayanne's hips attested to
how well he was doing it.

   NEW YORK _ Not everyone was at the beach over the weekend. The
hot ticket at American Ballet Theater, which drew packed houses at
the Metropolitan Opera House, was ``Giselle'' in its first three
performances of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely has this beloved 19th-century ballet seen such a
concentration of splendid dancing from the corps and from a
succession of peasant heroines betrayed each time by an
aristocratic seducer. Viviana Durante, a guest from the Royal
Ballet in Britain, made her New York debut as Giselle on Saturday
night, and through the amazing power of her technique's
expressiveness, she triumphed along with her Albrecht, a fiercely
romantic Jose Manuel Carreno.
</P>
<P>
   The difference was in the details in each cast. At the Saturday
matinee Julio Bocca, stepping in as Albrecht for the injured Angel
Corella, brought his passion and bravura to complement Ashley
Tuttle's purity as Giselle. They met on the same high level,
although they approached the ballet from opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Kent and Vladimir Malakhov, by contrast, were in total
stylistic and dramatic harmony on Friday night, offering an
extraordinary depth that elevated this ``Giselle'' to one of the
best in years. Ms. Kent and Malakhov gave this epitome of a
romantic ballet a visual and emotional beauty rooted in classical
style. Verismo was banished from their acting, but expressiveness
through form was always present.
</P>
<P>
   There was the magic flow of a waking dream to their story of
love and betrayal, which made the drama unfold with unusual
inevitability.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of remorse and regeneration are the signature of the
romantic era, and ``Giselle'' comes alive only if these themes are
made believable to a modern audience. At its most superficial,
``Giselle,'' which had its premiere in Paris in 1841, can
degenerate into mere prettiness. Yet in its dichotomy between a
realistic first act among German villagers and the formal but even
more dramatic second act, set among wilis, the ghosts of jilted
maidens, the ballet's creators worked on a deeper subliminal level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giselle'' was the brainchild of the French romantic poet
Theophile Gautier, and in these two acts he embodied his theory
about ballet in general. Ballet was, he wrote, ``at once the most
material and ideal of spectacles.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kent and Malakhov, through carefully considered details that
not everyone copied, tilted toward the ideal side, but their
Giselle and Albrecht in Act I were still flesh and blood.
Abandoning the histrionic veneer of last year, Malakhov was all
classical restraint in the broader sense of a classical actor
approaching a romantic role.
</P>
<P>
   A high note was struck early on in the vivid stage business for
Clinton Luckett, as Wilfred, Albrecht's squire, who forcefully
protested his master's plan to disguise himself as a peasant to
seduce Giselle. Malakhov's count was, however, impetuous and used
to being obeyed. Unlike others, his Albrecht gave the audience a
knowing look when he tore off a daisy petal that told Giselle he
loved her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kent's entrance telegraphs a sunny disposition, but her
village girl was essentially shy with eyes downcast. She did not
overdo the moment when she had a faint heart, and there was an
elegance in her solos that matched Malakhov's noble line. Arms
linked, they danced as one.
</P>
<P>
   Giselle's solo in Act I has been simplified in this production,
presumably directly by Kevin McKenzie, the company's artistic
director. Only Ms. Durante ends the solo on the knee, as is
traditional, instead of standing up, and she packs more footwork
into her diagonal of turns. But Ms. Kent had no trouble with the
usual hops on toe, and her mad scene, when Giselle discovers
Albrecht's true identity, was effective in its simplicity, unlike
last year. The flute passages of Adolphe Adam's score were the
wilis' voices, which she heard so visibly in her haunted daze.
</P>
<P>
   Malakhov, ecstatic in the first act, refrained from his own mad
scene. All the more effective was his sudden rage and grief at
Giselle's death. Like Bocca, he was rejected by the villagers and
rushed out. Carreno, on Saturday night, threw himself at Giselle's
body.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the peasant pas de deux in Act I was vibrantly danced
by Yan Chen and Joaquin De Luz. Christine Dunham as Bathilde,
Albrecht's fiancee, distilled a range of emotions in a short time;
she was gracious, haughty and furious.
</P>
<P>
   An important foil to Malakhov was Ethan Brown, who magnificently
made Hilarion, Albrecht's village rival, especially embittered. His
acting and dancing were forceful; enraged in Act I, he was
desperate as the wilis' victim in Act II.
</P>
<P>
   Irina Dvorovenko as Myrta, the Wili Queen, had the high-flying
power and impressive authority to make the role all it should be.
Ms. Kent's wili in Act II was all the more different in its
ethereal grace. Yet this was an assertive ghost, no longer shy, who
pleaded for Albrecht's salvation.
</P>
<P>
   All the romantic images were found in Ms. Kent's solo, but it
was the two duets with Malakhov that gave this performance a
transformative purity. Always stretched in his line during his
partnering, Malakhov kept within a classical framework that carried
over to his solo. Toward the end his image of a spent Albrecht with
long curly hair, supported by Giselle, recalled pictures of
Nijinsky in the same pose.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Durante and Carreno worked in a very different emotional
key, and Ms. Durante's second act was more unusual than her first.
Temperamentally she is an allegro dancer and she darted out in her
first entrance with a swiftness that colored much of her
performance. This was a lively Giselle eager to express her love of
dance, which she did admirably in her big solo in Act I.
</P>
<P>
   The mad scene was strong, incorporating the traditional mime.
This Giselle had chills, imagined a baby she never had and pushed
hysterically through the crowd. Unlike the others, she seemed to
stab herself with Albrecht's sword, which would explain why
Hilarion makes her a cross in Act II. The church would not bury a
suicide in hallowed ground. Two years ago, the lush scenery by
Gianni Quaranta still had a stone cross with her name.
</P>
<P>
   Carreno's Albrecht was commanding but serene. His masculine
grace carried over to his solo in Act II, where he projected the
poetic sensibility of a repentant sinner. Ms. Durante was not a
wafting spirit: through her high extensions, sharp phrasing and
powerful leaps, she was a wili with a human heart who fought for
her man.
</P>
<P>
   Gillian Murphy's debut as Myrta showed technique, especially
leaps, used to expressive purpose, and Olga Yaroslavtzeva's
Bathilde had high drama. John Gardner excelled as a thinking man's
Hilarion, sly and mocking.
</P>
<P>
   An equally exciting performance came from Bocca's experienced
seducer with Ms. Tuttle's innocent but hearty Giselle. Their first
act was playful until Ms. Tuttle's startling mad scene, full of
rage.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of their dancing in Act II set off Sara Mau's fine
and severe Myrta. Rosalie O'Connor was a fun-loving Bathilde whose
world comes crashing down, a counterpart to Giselle. Charles Barker
conducted all three performances.

`TCHAIKOVSKY': GUEST ARTIST PROVED HIMSELF AS EUROPEAN BALLET
PRINCE
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The message of George Balanchine's ``Tchaikovsky
Piano Concerto No. 2,'' presented by the New York City Ballet in an
all-Tchaikovsky program on Thursday night at the New York State
Theater, is that the essence of ballet classicism is a timeless,
simple formal grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   That message was reiterated intriguingly by the performance of
Robert Tewsley, a guest artist, in the male lead role. The
English-trained Tewsley is every inch a European ballet prince.
Royalty rests on his shoulders like a cloak, imbuing his every move
with its silken softness. But there was not a hint of classical
mannerism to his lyrical line or understated but unignorable
presence.
</P>
<P>
   The compelling simplicity of his turns and brise, and his easy,
accommodating partnering of Miranda Weese were a perfect foil for
the slightly subversive wit and musical phrasing of this remarkable
ballerina. Her mix of imperiousness and alert physicality said a
great deal about the immutable nature of classicism. Jennie Somogyi
brought extra authority and quiet pizazz to the second-ballerina
role. But somewhat ragged corps work detracted from the whole.
Cameron Grant was the piano soloist.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the line Balanchine's 1981 ``Mozartiana'' seems
to have changed from whispered prayer to sunny technical showpiece.
Darci Kistler and Philip Neal communicated that latter personality
well, though there were a few mispartnered moments toward the end.
New as the second male lead the always stylish Arch Higgins brought
an agreeable and appropriate astringency to the edgy Gigue.
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine's ``Diamonds'' completed the program. The evening's
conductors were Andrea Quinn and Hugo Fiorato.

   When a camera crew is invited to follow, the images often make

<P>
   But such reality TV shows may find police less welcoming
following two Supreme Court decisions allowing police to be sued
financially over the filming of arrests or searches on private
property. The high court ruled that so-called ``media ride-alongs''
may violate the Constitution's Fourth Amendment ban on unreasonable
searches and seizures.

<P>
   To whom it may concern:
</P>
<P>
   By now you doubtless have read or heard about the Supreme Court
decisions involving media ride-alongs with police which, on first
glance, would appear to cripple the very foundation upon which our
popular ``reality'' shows are based.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. Now is not the time to panic. Instead, this is the
time for creative thinking. When high winds and bad weather forced
Robbie Knievel to call off his first Grand Canyon Death Jump, did
we fold the tent and wait until the next Sweeps period? Certainly
not _ we simply rescheduled a second Death Jump for the end of May
Sweeps. As our nightly lineup has proved so often, if it's tacky
enough, millions of people will watch it.
</P>
<P>
   Please take a look at the following shows we have penciled in
for the fall lineup. We're excited, and hope you will be, too.
</P>
<P>
   `` Krispy Kreme: Life on the Sweets'' _ Gritty look at what goes
on inside the popular donut shop when the ``hot donuts'' sign
lights up late at night. Plenty of grainy, jumpy, hand-held camera
shots of the donuts coming off the conveyer belt, the crowd
gathering at the cash register and the sense of relief expressed
(through close-ups) by employees at enjoying near-24-hour
unofficial police protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGruff: All Bark, All Bite'' _ No-holds-barred,
documentary-style feature showing a day in the life of the Crime
Dog. Nothing is out-of-bounds, as the in-school question-and-answer
segment shows. (``Do you have a dog girlfriend?'' one third-grader
asks. ``Have you had your shots?'' wonders another.) Real inside
stuff; McGruff, for instance, unwinds at one point and reveals the
effects of job pressure while lapping pensively at a small bowl of
scotch. Includes hilarious outtake footage of McGruff clowning
around with oversize fire hydrant (to be shown under closing
credits).
</P>
<P>
   ``Lovely Rita, Meter Maid'' _ (Title tentative; still checking
for permission. Possible alternate: ``Ticket to Ride,'' though
similar licensing problems may arise.) Touching weekly stories of
the most misunderstood members of the Thin Blue Line. Follows the
brave men and women in their little scooters as they chalk tires,
check their watches and hand out tickets. Short bios of each week's
subjects. WARNING: Extremely graphic language directed at officers
by motorists. Suggest scheduling after 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Thinner Blue Line: Police Explorers'' _ Unflinching look at
teens who hope to further their dream of becoming police officers
by participating in the community volunteer program. Each week we
follow different Explorers as they struggle with classic on-the-job
challenges posed by civilians _ indifference, ridicule and
downright hostility _ as well as acne, dating woes and other teen
problems. NOTE: Will be edited to downplay subjects' repeated
references to how much they love guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real Stories of the Highway Patrol Motor Pool'' _ The beauty
here is in the access. Inside footage of oil changes, brake jobs,
siren repair, etc. Nothing is off-limits _ the coffee breaks, the
gossip sessions, nothing. In short, the tears, the laughter and the
personal phone calls made on company time. Massive crossover
appeal. &QL;

POP REVIEW: LOOKING THROUGH A KEEN EYE, SOMETIMES WITH A WINK 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To rock or not to rock? That was the question raised
by Fountains of Wayne last Tuesday night at the Bowery Ballroom.
This New York group answered positively in songs that merrily
ransacked the memory of a generation raised on scruffy guys playing
guitars. But it did so with a wink, since shrewd bands like this
one know that rock heroics are as gloriously dumb as they are
seductive.
</P>
<P>
   The singer and guitarist Chris Collingswood and the bassist Adam
Schlesinger write the songs that distinguish Fountains of Wayne
from other hit seekers. They specialize in slices of Eastern life
fleshed out in radio-friendly sing-alongs. ``Utopia Parkway,'' the
title track of the band's new Atlantic Records release, reveals the
dreams of a rock dude growing older in a cover band, while
``Denise'' is a furtive love ode to a Lexus-driving travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   The details sparkle in these songs, not only because they are
amusing, but because they deepen them beyond parody as well.
Musical nods to earlier pop savants like Billy Joel and the Knack
add another dimension. Those echoes form the buried soundtrack that
gives inspiration to the suburban strivers of these pop vignettes.
</P>
<P>
   Collingswood struck a droll pose throughout, jovially tussling
with the guitarist Jody Porter over whether they should let loose
and indulge in some guitar-god theatrics. The singer gently mocked
Semisonic, whose modern-rock hit ``Closing Time'' resembles a
Fountains song without the sarcastic edge. He also did a spot-on
imitation of Liam Gallagher from Oasis singing ``Wonderwall.'' ``I
love that song,'' Collingswood said of this worldwide smash,
conceding that grandiose gestures sometimes touch even a
smarty-pants like himself.
</P>
<P>
   What rescues Fountains of Wayne from drowning in its own
cleverness is a genuine affection for rock 'n' roll and the people
who revel in it. Porter embodied that heart in concert, shooting
off flashy riffs, quoting cliches from other guitarists, and
continuing to play even when a friend presented him with a birthday
cake. His attempt to get Collingswood to play some good-time cover
tunes was a routine they'd worked before. But it still proved
endearing, partly because when the players did launch into snippets
of old ZZ Top and Knack hits, they all had so much fun.

`BURGOS': SWIFTLY PACED AND WELL ACTED
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Puerto Rico, N.Y.)  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Anger belongs in art'' the young Puerto Rican poet Julia de
Burgos tells Pablo Neruda in Carmen Rivera's celebration of her
life and work, ``Julia de Burgos: Child of the Water.'' And in this
woman there was anger enough to fill countless poems. She was born
in Puerto Rico in 1918 and died on a sidewalk in East Harlem in
1953, leaving behind two shipwrecked marriages, the debris of
several disastrous affairs, a blank decade of incurable alcoholism
and three volumes of verse that testify to a fierce struggle to
achieve a magnificent purity and honesty of spirit, emotion and
expression.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rivera has a struggle of her own. In 17 scenes she evokes
the whole complicated life _ in Puerto Rico, Havana, Washington and
New York _ peppering the dialogue with lines from 20 de Burgos
poems and weaving into it many allusions to principal de Burgos
themes, mainly a longing for Puerto Rico's independence and the
identification of it and its people with the waters of one of its
rivers.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of the action she also introduces 11 other
characters, making one suspect that at least some of them are there
only to give voice to some of Ms. Rivera's ideas. Her passion for
de Burgos and her work is palpable, but it is doubtful that even a
viewer with extensive knowledge of the life and poetry will leave
this play without some sense of confusion.
</P>
<P>
   In the production by the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater, Manuel
Martin, the director, keeps the action swift, evenly paced and
deliberate, so that no matter how willful or even foolish de Burgos
sometimes seems, the specter of inescapable doom seems to shadow
her throughout. Another specter comes off more believably than
would seem possible. De Burgos famously complained she often seemed
to be two people in one body, and Ms. Rivera gives her two
embodiments: Sol Miranda as the de Burgos everyone else saw and
Lourdes Martin as the shadow de Burgos whom de Burgos battled with
throughout her life.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miranda is pure fire in this role: angry, hurt, petulant,
wildly intelligent, proud and fleeing every moment from fear and
doubt. And Ms. Martin's restraint, slightly perverse seductiveness
and sometimes cruel tongue finally convince one that she is indeed
the obverse image of the poet herself. These two actors richly
deserve the ovations they get.
</P>
<P>
   Performances are in English from Wednesday through Friday and in
Spanish on weekends.

`PHANTOM MENACE' LOOMS BIG SECOND WEEKEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``The Phantom Menace'' will become the first film
to top $200 million domestically in less than two weeks _ blowing
away the previous record for the shortest time to hit the milestone
by an astounding eight days.
</P>
<P>
   Studio sources say a tide of Memorial Day moviegoers will easily
blast ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' past the
milestone set by ``Independence Day'' in 1996. ``Phantom Menace''
showed impressive second-weekend legs with an estimated $49 million
at 2,970 theaters during Friday-Sunday, pushing its 12-day total
past $188 million, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people still in the mood to see `Phantom
Menace' who didn't want to go in the first few days,'' said movie
analyst Arthur Rockwell. ``There's also been a big shift in
sentiment in the positive direction after it opened with all the
negative buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom Menace'' was so dominant that it took in more than
double the $22.8 million opening of ``Notting Hill'' even though
the Julia Roberts-Hugh Grant vehicle, showing at 2,745 theaters,
set a record for best opening ever by a romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth installment in George Lucas' saga, set 30 years
before the original ``Star Wars,'' took in $13.3 million on Friday,
$18 million on Saturday and a projected $17.7 million on Sunday as
the 20th Century Fox release saw its total decline less than 25
percent from its opening Friday-Sunday. ``There were a lot of
families and older audiences that came to see it this weekend,''
said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said ``Phantom Menace'' will probably wind up with a
final domestic gross of $375 million, which would leave it fourth
on the all-time list after ``Titanic'' with $600.8 million, ``Star
Wars'' with $460.9 million and ``E.T. _ The Extraterrestrial'' with
$399.8 million. After 12 days, ``Menace'' is already the
29th-highest domestic grosser ever.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum predicted ``Phantom Menace'' will lead the box office
next weekend, when Disney opens adventure-thriller ``Instinct,''
and then surrender first place on the following weekend to New
Line's ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal's rollout of ``Notting Hill'' topped industry
expectations, and its four-day total could hit $28 million by the
end of today's shows. Bucksbaum said the final gross could hit an
impressive $105 million, adding, ``It's a classic example of
gearing your programming toward an audience because this is the
only date-crowd movie for the early summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell said the film benefited from Grant's presence as a
counterpoint to Roberts' star power, adding, ``Sophisticated
audiences know he's a good actor, so he's sort of the mysterious
plus in this movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Notting Hill'' represented the third straight solid opening
for Universal, following ``Life'' and ``The Mummy'' in a clear
signal that the studio has turned around from last year's downbeat
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled,'' said Nikki Rocco, Universal's distribution
chief. ``We always believed there was room for another film besides
`Phantom Menace' and our surveys show `Notting Hill' is getting
well-above-average recommendations from the audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal also continued to post strong results from ``The
Mummy'' with $10 million at 3,399 theaters, pushing the
action-adventure past $114 million after 24 days. ``The Mummy'' is
already the 129th highest domestic grosser, topping last year's
``You've Got Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing a distant fourth was Fox's fifth weekend of
``Entrapment'' with a respectable $5 million at 2,869 theaters,
followed by Sony's disappointing opening of virtual-reality
thriller ``The Thirteenth Floor'' with $3.1 million at 1,815 sites.
The latter's total barely edged Warner Bros.' ninth weekend of
``The Matrix'' with $2.6 million at 2,521 screens.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum noted that ``Thirteenth Floor'' covered much of the
same territory as ``The Matrix,'' which has now topped $152 million
thanks to impressive special effects and the star power of Keanu
Reeves. ``The results show the importance of being first into
theaters with the same type of movie and having a major star for a
virtual-reality film,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 were Fox Searchlight's third weekend of
``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' with $1.6 million at 1,093 theaters,
Fox's eighth weekend of ``Never Been Kissed'' with $1.4 million at
1,888 theaters, Universal's seventh weekend of ``Life'' with $1.2
million at 1,214 screens and DreamWorks' second weekend of ``The
Love Letter'' with $1.1 million at 781 locations. Paramount's sixth
weekend of ``Election,'' followed in 11th with $1 million at 827
sites.

M'S STAFF CAN'T STAND PROSPERITY 
</HEADLINE>

 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ No giddiness was apparent in the Mariner clubhouse
before Sunday's game. But a milestone is a milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nary a single kazoo.
</P>
<P>
   The worst pitching staff in the major leagues had squeezed its
earned run average down to 5.98 _ the first time in nearly a month
the number had been below a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it was a small milestone, sort of like the Lewis and
Clark expedition getting to Nebraska. But no journey can begin
without these first steps.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' quest is to avoid being the worst staff in
baseball history, a distinction belonging to the 1930 Phillies at
6.30.
</P>
<P>
   Things were going so well, too.
</P>
<P>
   After reaching a team high of 6.81 at mid-month, the Mariners
until yesterday had won 10 of 12 games thanks mostly to a) pitching
that bordered on the respectable, and b) a weenie schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Then they gave up 15 runs to Tampa Bay, a Devil Ray club record,
sending a jolt of hope through the long-cold graves of the old
Philly staff. Sixty-nine years is a long time to hold a baseball
record. The late Phils would just as soon move on to a new gig in
that special place in hell reserved for guys who can't get anybody
out.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to know whether that hot spot is being prepared for the
Mariner staff, although yesterday's principal perpetrators, Ken
Cloude and Mac Suzuki, certainly would be wise to shop at the
Asbestos Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, one 15-7 loss does not a failure make. But neither
does a winning streak portend eventual success when the bad guys
have been uniformly mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are in the midst of a long run of opponent
ordinariness that is hard to come by. Barring a big winning streak
by a future foe, the Mariners are destined to avoid a team playing
better than .500 ball until a June 11 interleague game at the
Kingdome against the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Since the last good team they played was in Boston May 12, that
means the Mariners will have gone a month without meeting a single
team equipped with hairy knuckles and an unpleasant disposition.
</P>
<P>
   None of that is the Mariners' fault, of course. It is not the
players' responsibility that most baseball talent is grouped in a
few places, leaving the remaining clubs to forage for roots and
berries.
</P>
<P>
   But it does behoove the Mariners to come out of this 24-game run
with the claimers with at least 16 wins in order to have pretense
to the AL West throne.
</P>
<P>
   The current modest dash has left the Mariners four games in
arrears of Texas, which is hardly terrible for the end of May. But
yesterday's astonishing wildness in Cloude and Suzuki, who left
catcher Dan Wilson with enough bad hops to earn a permanent
bitter-beer face, forces the non-musical question:
</P>
<P>
   Moyer, Garcia and who?
</P>
<P>
   Erstwhile No. 1 pitcher Jeff Fassero leads the AL in hits, home
runs and earned runs served up, and is second in walks. After the
creditable performances of Jamie Moyer and rookie Freddy Garcia,
the Mariners had Cloude for the No. 4 spot and no one for No. 5,
thanks to a run of off-days.
</P>
<P>
   But soon enough they will play many games against many good
teams. It is asking a lot of the long grass and heavy air next door
at the Guilty Pleasure to keep the staff from its dubious dalliance
with the '30 Phils.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about that now,'' said pitching coach Stan
Williams before the game. ``We're trying to build confidence on a
daily basis. Success will build on itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the incremental approach is Williams' only possibility.
With a mind-bending eight pitchers having made their major league
debut under Williams this season _ and 18 pitchers employed
overall, a league high shared with second-year Tampa Bay _ there is
not exactly a thick book with which to gauge progress against
history.
</P>
<P>
   Cloude and Suzuki are among the most senior of the youngsters,
with a fair amount of major league time. But the kind of
noncompetitiveness shown yesterday _ ``Mac was terrible, there's no
other way to describe it,'' said manager Lou Piniella _ continues a
chronic problem that is destined to show later in the season: Too
many innings for the few good arms.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how strong Jose Paniagua, with 22 appearances
already, will be in September. No one knows whether John Halama is
a starter or reliever. No one knows whether Cloude or Suzuki can
stop out-thinking themselves on a major league mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked hard all spring on pitch command,'' said Williams.
``We had a good spring, then we start the season walking everybody
in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the year, our new people followed behind the leaders.
Our one and two guys got behind so badly, it spooked the rest of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the key moment was May 16, when Moyer's
eight-inning, 5-1 win over Kansas City ``showed the young guys it
was possible to get outs in the major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   That was also the start of the decent dozen games that made for
10 wins. Now Williams is praying that the reverse is not true, that
one horror show doesn't make for a week of kiddy screamers.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the staff ERA is back to 6.17, he's again hearing the
footsteps of long-dead Phillies.

DEVIL RAYS STING M'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The explosion started with extra-base hits, one after
another.
</P>
<P>
   It continued with walks _ a Tampa Bay Devil Ray going to first,
Mariners pitching coach Stan Williams heading to the mound, manager
Lou Piniella pacing in the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   It concluded when home plate umpire Rocky Roe rung up Jose
Canseco on a borderline third strike.
</P>
<P>
   Added up, it was 44 minutes of fourth-inning futility for the
Mariners, who were jeered by their own fans during Sunday's 15-7
defeat at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's eight-run fourth set a club record for runs in one
inning, and the Devil Rays set another team record for most runs in
a game.
</P>
<P>
   Though their four-game winning streak was snuffed, the M's still
managed to win two of three from Tampa Bay and remain one of
baseball's hottest teams. But they did not look the part from 6:12
to 6:56 p.m., when the Devil Rays sent 14 batters to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Three Mariners threw 64 pitches, most of which were nowhere near
the catcher's target. Instead, Dan Wilson was frequently forced to
go from a crouch to his knees, either to pray for a strike or to
stop a misguided delivery. Perhaps both.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the inning, the bases were loaded and Tampa Bay was
ready to fire. Six times, a Devil Ray appeared at the plate with
every base occupied. It seemed endless to everyone but the Devil
Rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 44-minute half-inning? It didn't seem like that long at
all,'' center fielder Randy Winn said after his 4-for-5 evening.
``You don't want to be the guy to stop it. You feed off the guy in
front of you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just hoping we'd get the third out,'' said a perplexed
Piniella, who first had to wait forever for the second out.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Huskey hung out in right field and was just like a
Mariners fan, hoping that one of his teammates would throw a
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to happen or it won't stop,'' he said. ``When you're
standing on your feet busting your butt for that long, it's not a
very fun inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the abuse was self-inflicted by the Mariner pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Ken Cloude gave up runs in every inning he pitched.
</P>
<P>
   Mac Suzuki replaced Cloude. Just like his predecessor, Suzuki
served up a variety of juicy offerings when he wasn't giving
Wilson's hamstrings a workout with pitches in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki retired only one of the seven batters he faced, and the
fans heartily booed his ineffectiveness and cheered when Frankie
Rodriguez got up in the bullpen. Rodriguez finally muffled the
Devil Rays, but not before struggling with control problems like
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the assault ended, Canseco did not have enough
energy to complain about Roe's questionable third-strike call.
Miguel Cairo was Tampa Bay's biggest instigator, starting the
inning with a triple off Huskey's glove and contributing a
run-scoring single a half-hour later.
</P>
<P>
   Cloude, who had a 2.04 earned run average in eight relief
appearances after being demoted to the bullpen, has not pitched
well since returning to the rotation. In his three starts this
month, Cloude has a 10.95 ERA after giving up seven runs in
three-plus innings Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed home runs to Fred McGriff and John Flaherty on
consecutive pitches, eliciting the first boos of the night. Cloude
also hung an 0-and-2 breaking ball to Canseco, who roped the
mistake into the blue tarp in left field to tie Ken Griffey Jr. for
the major league lead in homers with 19.
</P>
<P>
   Cloude can't figure out why he has been more successful as a
reliever than a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a hitter and you've got to throw strikes to get him
out whether you're starting, relieving or whatever,'' he said.
``You get an opportunity to go back in the rotation ... that's not
exactly going out and making a good statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Cloude's starting status was affected by his
performance, Piniella said: ``We'll assess that (Monday).''
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander John Halama is the leading candidate to replace
Cloude in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   His team trailing 13-2 after four innings, Piniella began
pulling his regulars, resting them for future battles like the next
three against Baltimore beginning Monday night at the Kingdome.

UNIVERSITY TROUPE HEADING TO CHINA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Today in 5th graf refers to Monday.) 
BY ROBERT MONROE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The student actors got the news between the first
and second acts: Warplanes from their native country had just
inadvertently bombed their soon-to-be hosts' embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   American bombs were blasting the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
while theater students at California State University, Northridge,
were running through their seventh on-campus performance of the
musical adaptation of a Studs Terkel book.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, television was filled with images of angry Chinese
pelting the American Embassy in Beijing with stones. It looked like
the audience at the Shanghai Center Theater could become the
proverbial rough room for CSUN's production of ``Working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God. Are we going to go? Are we not going to go?'' Lynn
Heck said she and others in the cast wondered.
</P>
<P>
   They will leave as scheduled today. Time has toned down the
violence in China. The State Department has softened its travel
advisory. Students and the professors taking their show on the road
say they aren't worried. Art, they believe, will transcend
politics. But some in the company said their confidence has been
nicked a bit by nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I wonder if it's such a good idea or if we're doing
it because we've already paid for it,'' Heck quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the troupe, however, said their Chinese hosts
distinguish between theaters of art and theaters of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arts ultimately are part of the very important way that
individuals relate to one another at the human level,'' said
Heinrich Falk, a CSUN theater professor who was invited in 1993 to
direct three plays at the Shanghai Theater Academy. ``They
transcend the momentary bumps and bruises of political
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Owen Smith, a theater department faculty member traveling with
the students, said the troupe obviously represents no political
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just a bunch of theater people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, a 48-year-old graduate student, expects art to rise above
political squabbles in the theater, but says that won't protect her
if she walks down Shanghai's streets. The blonde joked that she has
considered telling the Chinese she is Dutch, just to be on the safe
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to keep my head to the ground, do the show and be
very, very quiet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The play, which Stephen Schwartz adapted from the book in 1978,
relates the stories of American blue-collar workers interviewed by
Terkel. Falk said theater officials in Shanghai read the script
before sending the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   The play was a natural choice for the CSUN troupe _ and not
because of Terkel's leftist leanings. Director Michael Reno won the
Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle award for his 1981 production.
While Reno said ideology was not behind the choice, the play's
script, taken straight from interviews by Terkel of American
workers, ``not only represented theater but also a cross-section of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Cast members agreed the play's themes should go over well in the
People's Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The educated ones will perhaps get some insight about
Americans who they don't hear so much about, those Americans who
are the backbone of our country,'' Heck said.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Melissa Bustamante, a junior from Sherman Oaks, said she
felt some misgivings about the trip for about a week. Then she felt
comforted by the fact that no American living in China during the
embassy assaults was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the musical's theme is lost in the translation, the
music itself ``is one thing they'll understand,'' Bustamante said.
</P>
<P>
   The Shanghai trip will mark the second time a theater troupe
from CSUN has traveled to a foreign country to perform. Last year,
students performed the play ``Roosters'' in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Falk said CSUN is paying for the travel and Shanghai for the
lodging of the 21 students who will fly to China today. He did not
have an exact figure for CSUN's tab, but said the students' tickets
each cost $650. The faculty members paid for their own tickets.
</P>
<P>
   If there were a hint of last-minute danger, Falk added, he
wouldn't hesitate to keep the theater company home.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, there's no discouragement for travel to China.
We have our tickets, we have our visas, and we have a first-class
show that is going to Shanghai,'' he said.

USC ELIMINATES PEPPERDINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It looked like a regional final. It felt like a
regional final. Instead of Omaha and a trip to the College World
Series, though, USC gets Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be super.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans, who gave Pepperdine a second game, and a second
life, with a Bad News Bears fielding display, came back to beat the
Waves 12-7 on Sunday night at Dedeaux Field in the
double-elimination tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Second-seeded USC (36-24) won the first-round regional and plays
the Pacific-10 champion Cardinal next weekend in a second-round
``super regional'' to determine a spot in the CWS. Stanford, the
national No.6 seed that won its first-round regional, is the
favorite to host the best two-of-three series.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans don't care where they play next week; they're just
happy to stave off elimination after top-seeded Pepperdine (46-16)
won the day's first game 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   By the time USC reliever Jason Lane ended the seven hours of
play by striking out Dan Bir, the Trojans were ready to celebrate _
even though they don't receive a trophy, just a plane ride to Palo
Alto.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Losing the first game) was kind of like a wake-up call,''
said Lane, an all-tournament outfielder who pitched in both games.
``This could have been our last game. When you have that on the
line, it makes it feel like a big-time championship game. Which it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   USC catcher Eric Munson, selected as the most outstanding player
of the series after he hit two home runs Sunday, agreed with Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all came down to one game,'' Munson said. ``It felt like a
big one, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waves made their first playoff appearance in four years, and
it showed in the second game. Pepperdine, the nation's No. 2 team
in fielding percentage, made four errors, including one by
shortstop Tony Sanchez in the second, when USC scored three runs,
and one by third baseman G.J. Raymundo in the third, when the
Trojans scored five.
</P>
<P>
   Raymundo had only eight errors entering the game, the Waves'
fifth of the weekend. He said fatigue played no role in his
defensive breakdown that allowed three runs to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a mental error, just physical,'' Raymundo said. ``We
were prepared to play, no matter how many games. We're used to
playing a lot of games in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans threw away the first game _ literally. Freshman
third baseman Beau Craig, who was an all-state catcher in high
school, had throwing errors on two consecutive ground balls in the
seventh that led to three Pepperdine runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hurried the throws,'' Craig said. ``Right after the game I
was thinking about it a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   USC right-hander Rik Currier (5-7) took the tough-luck loss in
the first game. Currier held Pepperdine to one run and six hits
through the first six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of Pepperdine's runs in the first game was earned.
</P>
<P>
   Gehrke, the Waves' All-American closer who leads the nation in
saves, matched his longest outing of the season in the first game.
He gave up one hit _ a bases-empty homer to Munson that made it 4-3
_ and struck out three in 21/3 innings to get the win.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves made the second game interesting in the seventh with
three runs to cut the lead to 10-7. At one point, they trailed 8-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to see a taste of why we won so many games,''
Pepperdine head coach Frank Sanchez said. ``(Our players) don't
have much quit in them. They fight tooth and nail.''

BRACK INHERITS THE WIN 
</HEADLINE>
 500-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ In the end, Kenny Brack did not set his sights on
any one man or machine in his quest to win the biggest race of his
life. He simply laid out a strategy for driving a perfect race and
followed it to the letter because, as Brack discovered in the three
months he spent studying the race, it was going to take a perfect
day to win the 83d Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no way Brack could have planned what transpired
Sunday at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   In a race that saw almost all the leaders fall by the wayside,
Brack inherited his first Indy 500 title when Robby Gordon ran out
of gas and fell out of the lead with one lap to go. As a result,
Brack, a 33-year-old native of Arvika, Sweden, and the Indy Racing
League's defending champion, needed to complete just one lap to win
the race, but mistakenly slowed down when Gordon's sputtering car
pulled into the pits just as the white flag was unfurled.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of fact, I did,'' said Brack, admitting the one
flaw to his day. ``I started slowing down. I guess we had it won,
but we just hadn't won it yet. I was just concentrating on bringing
to the flag safely, I don't get too emotional before I see the
checkered flag.''
</P>
<P>
   When Brack finally did come around for the checkered flag, his
No. 14 PowerTeam Dallara-Aurora was greeted in Victory Circle by
legendary car owner A.J. Foyt, a four-time Indy 500 winner from
Houston who Sunday savored his first as a car owner. And while it
took Gordon's gas tank to run dry for Brack's cup to runneth over
with milk, the fabled Brickyard's traditional nectar of victory,
Foyt, too, enjoyed a great day after his two other drivers, Billy
Boat and Robbie Buhl, finished third and sixth, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about Kenny Brack, Robbie Buhl, and Billy
Boat,'' Foyt gushed, sporting a Texas-sized grin. ``You qualify one
car in the front row (Boat), another in the third (Brack), and one
in the back (Buhl), and all finish in the Top 6. What else can you
ask for?''
</P>
<P>
   For Brack, it was a nice culmination of all that planning.
</P>
<P>
   It was, to be certain, a much better ending than his Indy 500
debut two years ago when he finished 33d after getting involved in
a crash on the warmup lap that wiped out the entire fifth row.
Brack returned to Indy last year as part of Foyt's stable and
started on the front row with his teammate Boat, the pole sitter,
but finished sixth when he ran out of fuel on Lap 88 and fell out
of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I could win the Indy 500,'' said Brack. ``I set
goals for myself to win in whatever I drive. I physically prepared
myself for this race. The car was perfect, and we took care of it
all week. I ran this race exactly the way I wanted to. Obviously,
some things had to fall into place, and some guys fell out of the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the leaders seemed to become endangered species as
they were felled by one problem or another.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was Arie Luyendyk, the 45-year-old Flying Dutchman
whose farewell tour of the Brickyard came to a crashing halt on Lap
117 when he rapidly closed in on the slower car of Tyce Carlson,
got on the brakes hard to avoid a collison, and spun backward
across the track and up the banking before slamming into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The furthest thing from my mind when I was going backwards
was, `I'm going to hit the wall here,' '' said Luyendyk. ``I was
thinking, `God, I can't believe that I did that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Another calamitous turn of events occurred three laps later when
Greg Ray, who had inherited the lead from Luyendyk, squandered it
in a pit-row collision with Mark Dismore that retired Ray's car to
the garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what happened,'' said Ray. ``I was told to go.
I was focusing on all the things I'm supposed to be focusing on
before heading back out again. The next thing I know, I went
sideways into the pit wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Cheever, the defending Indy 500 champion, then took the
point, but he, too, failed to hold the lead for longer than 20 laps
when smoke came pouring out of his wheezing Infiniti power plant on
Lap 140.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, there was Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   The CART driver, who crashed and finished 27th in Saturday's
Motorola 300 at Gateway International Speedway in Madison, Ill.,
was perhaps the most snakebitten of all the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   After Dismore crashed on Lap 169 while exiting Turn 2, Gordon,
who was behind the wheel of what was regarded as the fastest car in
the field, inherited the lead on Lap 171 when the leaders pitted
under caution with 30 laps to go. Problem was, Gordon and his
co-owner, John Menard, were gambling that they had enough in their
35-gallon fuel cell to cover the remaining 75 miles.
</P>
<P>
   They bet wrong and wound up big losers when Gordon's car
sputtered and fell dramatically off the pace as it came around Turn
4, ready to take the checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end, we could have come in under yellow, splashed for
fuel and beat them all out, but we didn't,'' Gordon said. ``I
thought all the stars were aligned. There was a full moon last
night here at Indy, it was beautiful, but the stars weren't aligned
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   They were for Brack.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal when I entered this race was to drive a perfect
race,'' Brack said. ``I had my plan for driving, and the team had
their plan for the car, and it all came together.''
</P>
<P>
   Perfectly.

SABRES BUFFING UP IMAGE OF A CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ They've taken it on the chin here so many times, there
isn't a plastic surgeon in the world who could tuck and suture this
city's self-esteem. Buffalo is synonymous with chicken wings and
cheap jokes, the former best when lathered with blue cheese
dressing, the latter garnished with cruel stabs about the
downtown's post-World War II decay.
</P>
<P>
   But, guess what, this city's hockey team is no joke. The
Senators and Bruins found that out, up close and personal.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Maple Leafs, also on the verge of being dismissed from
the Stanley Cup playoffs, have had it pushed in their faces, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate that word, `desperate,' '' said Leafs coach Pat Quinn,
when asked following a humiliating 5-2 loss here Saturday night how
his club would respond for Game 5 of the series, Monday night in
Toronto. ``Desperate guys die.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that time now for the Leafs, whose fans were anticipating a
mid-June coronation and now await the coroner's siren song.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs should have been desperate in Game 4, when they
already were in a 2-games-to-1 hole in the best-of-seven series.
Instead, they skated in a state of perpetual stupefication, like so
many pieces of petrified wood floating aimlessly across Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   A season in which the Leafs perhaps overachieved, during which
they flirted all season with the top spot in the Eastern
Conference, came crashing down in the second period of Game 4. The
Sabres struck for three goals in a span of 2:35, the Leafs
committing one giant boo-boo after another in their own end, and
were in command of a 5-0 lead well before the second intermission.
The Leafs at times looked as futile as, well, the Senators and
Bruins before them.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn tripped over his words in describing his club's
peformance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disintegrated isn't the word,'' he said, ``but it's pretty
close.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we hit the ice,'' added defenseman Bryan Berard, the
former Mount St. Charles star from Woonsocket, R.I., ``we left the
brains in the locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   It all has become such a repeat scenario in the last five weeks
that the redundancy is proof of miscalculation. It's time to begin
giving these Sabres appropriate credit.
</P>
<P>
   First off, discard the it's-a-one-man-team theory. Just as in
the Boston series, Buffalo netminder Dominik Hasek hasn't been a
critical factor in rubbing out the Leafs. He is, for the record,
hindered at the moment with a bothersome groin pull. However,
fronted by the Sabres' up-tempo forechecking game, which often
transforms into a '90s version of skate-and-shoot, Hasek has looked
more like a clinging bat than an acrobat in his cage. He's there.
He scares the Leafs. If they could put up any kind of assault and
get that red light to burn, maybe he would blink and fly away.
</P>
<P>
   There is just too much good stuff happening in front of Hasek _
much of it at the opposite end of the ice _ to say he's been
anything more than a distinguished attendee at this party.
</P>
<P>
   The brightest spot in Game 4 was the continuing renaissance of
Geoff Sanderson, the former Hartford 40-goal scorer whose career
has been stuck somewhere between slumber and comatose for the
better part of five seasons. He played on no fewer than three teams
last season (Carolina, Vancouver, and Buffalo), and in 75 games
totaled 11 goals and 18 assists. He was but a shadow of the speedy,
hard-shooting left wing who collected 46 goals and 89 points with
the Whale in 1992-93, the season in which he turned 21 years old.
</P>
<P>
   In 75 games this season, Sanderson again was a disappointment on
offense, knocking in only 12 goals and picking up a modest 30
points. Keep in mind, though, that Miroslav Satan led all Sabres
with only 66 points, albeit with an impressive 40 goals. For
six-plus months, October to April, the Sabre attack, if it could be
called that, was based on the conventional trap-and-counter
schematic that the majority of NHL clubs follow. Note: The only
team ever to win with that was the New Jersey Devils, who barely
have been a postseason factor since their '95 Cup.
</P>
<P>
   As the postseason has unfolded, the Sabres inch-by-inch have
stripped their trap-and-counter sheep's clothing. Sanderson is
skating and firing (two goals in Game 4). Satan, back in Game 3 of
this series after bruising an ankle in the Ottawa series, is
evolving as a creative (dare we say daring?) playmaker. And, hold
on, even the ham-handed Rob Ray chopped in a goal Saturday night,
ending a 110-game scoring drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously firing on all cylinders when Razor gets a
goal,'' kidded Lindy Ruff. Ray was so ecstatic, the Buffalo News
reported Sunday, that he called home to Sinclair, Ont., between
periods to share his joy with his family (one of those
only-in-hockey feel-good vignettes).
</P>
<P>
   The underlying truth in Ruff's good humor, though, is that the
Sabres have a lot more talent and touch in their lineup than most
of the hockey world believed all season. Chances are, neither
Dallas nor Colorado, the Sabres' probable next challenger, know it
yet. They're busy right now. But one of them had better be paying
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn can tell them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing a different way right now,'' said the Toronto
coach, sounding more bewildered than beleaguered after the Game 4
pounding, which included the outing of goalie Curtis Joseph after
40 minutes. ``At the end of the season, they played a fall-back
(i.e. modified trap) style of game. They were defense-first all the
time. When you play that, you don't get a lot of chances, and it's
harder to score when you get those chances. But they always were a
team that, per chance, was a pretty accurate team. In the games we
had against them, they didn't outchance us very often, but their
scoring ratio was much better. They showed they have scoring
ability.''
</P>
<P>
   All the Sabres have to do now is play .500 hockey, win five of a
possible 10 remaining games, and they'll have their first Stanley
Cup. A championship by itself wouldn't put an end to the maligning
of this metropolis, where, for the record, the sky was sapphire
blue and the temparature near 90 Sunday (take that, you frozen
tundra taunters).
</P>
<P>
   But you never know what could happen. Turnarounds can be rooted
in unlikely sources.
</P>
<P>
   Boston found its way by fashioning the back of Faneuil Hall into
an overpriced fast-food eatery (urban planning you only could learn
at Harvard, I bet).
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland made it big on the back of the Indians and a new
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills did a lot for this town, getting to four Super Bowls,
but in their own way, failing each time in the big one, ultimately
left only a cracked layer of shellack over Buffalo's faded image.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, the Sabres play on, a merry band of Czechs,
Russians, Slovaks, and assorted North Americans, at least
burnishing a battered city's psyche. While Canada's dollar sags,
its game spreads good cheer and high hope in a US city so desperate
_ sorry, Mr. Quinn _ for something really good to come marching
down Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, how about a parade?

 SOX-INDIANS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Perfect?
</P>
<P>
   No, Red Sox rookie Brian Rose's flirtation with a perfect game
ended with David Justice, the first Cleveland batter of the sixth
inning, when shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, ranging far beyond the
scope of what is considered a shortstop's terrain, couldn't put the
finishing touches to what would have been a highlight-reel play.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's off-balance throw from the right-field side of
second base after fielding Justice's bouncer pulled first baseman
Mike Stanley off the bag, which was akin to a figure skater's
wobbly landing after executing a triple salchow. It went in the
books as an error, but for degree of difficulty, it should have
been scored a 9 on a scale of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as a perfectly splendid finish to what loomed as the
sternest test of the spring for the Sox, there could have been no
better sendoff for the team's return home than Sunday's 4-2 win
that gave the Sox a three-game sweep of the Indians. The victory
also gave the Red Sox a 12-4 record in a two-week test against the
iron of the American League and a 19-8 record for the month of May,
the team's best month in nearly three years, with a date against
the Detroit Tigers Monday at Fenway Park still to come.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who nearly threw his cherished glove in frustration
after his error opened the way to two Indians runs in the sixth,
has no need to turn in any IOUs to Rose. His three-run home run in
the third off Indians starter Doc Gooden spotted the kid a 3-0
lead, and he walked, stole second, and scored on Mike Stanley's
two-out single in the eighth, a run that reduced the anxiety level
for Tom Gordon's 10th save and second in two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in and said I was sorry, but what can you say, it was a
tough play,'' Garciaparra said of encountering Rose in the dugout
after the inning, in which Einar Diaz's one-out double ended Rose's
no-hit bid and an error by Stanley and a groundout brought home two
runs, spoiling the shutout, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think he was upset at all,'' Garciaparra said. ``I
was probably more upset for him. The guys were busting their butts
for him. We knew he was doing his job, and we wanted to do whatever
we could for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose would be hard-pressed to do his job any better than he has
in his first three starts, two of which came against the Yankees,
the defending World Series winners, and Sunday's against the
Indians, who merely led the league in hitting and were on a
record-setting pace for runs scored before the Sox swept into
Jacobs Field and took three straight. It was the first time this
season that the Indians have been swept, and the last time they
were swept at home by the Sox, in 1990, they were still occupying
Municipal Stadium, now a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as fine a game as I've ever seen a pitcher that young
(23) pitch _ not throw, but pitch _ in the big leagues,'' Red Sox
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said of Rose, who needed just 56
pitches to dispatch the first 15 Indians in order Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was working. That was just about as perfect as you
could throw 56 pitches,'' Kerrigan said. ``I think he might have
missed his spot four times in the first 56 pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Both of the Indians' runs allowed by Rose were unearned, which
means that in his first three starts since his summons from
Pawtucket, the righthander has allowed one earned run in 19
innings. Numbers like those keep you in the big leagues for a long
time. Those kind of numbers will make you Pedro Martinez money, if
you do it long enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 confidence thing for me,'' Rose said, ``is I'm
healthy. I'm working hard on my days off to stay healthy, because I
want to try and help this club out and get wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like everybody else, a piece of the puzzle on what
hopefully will be a championship team.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rose gave up a leadoff single to Manny Ramirez to open the
seventh, manager Jimy Williams let some of the other puzzle pieces
tumble out. Lefthander Mark Guthrie was the first of four Sox
relievers to finish off the Indians, with the finale Gordon's
strikeout of David Justice in the first rematch of Sox closer and
Sox killer since Justice ended the Sox' season last October with a
two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   ``It crossed my mind for a minute,'' Gordon said, ``but no more
than any other out. I still had trouble with the command of my
fastball, but the good thing is I have my curveball, and I can get
strikeouts again.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon had been reluctant to throw his nastiest curve, the one
that tends to travel about 59 feet and leaves hitters swinging at
air, for fear it would put a strain on his tender elbow. But with
his arm strength back, that concern is ebbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demon is back,'' Kerrigan said of Gordon's money pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Upon further reflection, Kerrigan decided that ``demon'' might
not set well with a guy who points to the heavens after every save.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's call it Lord Charles,'' he said. ``The old-fashioned
term.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, faced with 16 games against the Yankees, Indians
and Blue Jays in the last two weeks, responded with old-fashioned
grit, winning 12. They had to sweep the Indians just to maintain
their half-game lead over the Bombers, who now have won five
straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys play hard every day,'' said Guthrie, who struck out
Jim Thome after Ramirez stole second and retired the next two
hitters on ground balls before Jim Corsi and Rheal Cormier worked
the eighth. ``Only a handful of teams do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty intense group. I think that starts with guys
like Nomar and Pedro and Flash, the way they go about their
business every day. When you see your superstars doing that,
there's no reason everybody else can't do it, either.''

REVOLUTION ACHIEVED SOME GOALS VS. METROSTARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ John Harkes was conversing with Revolution
teammates on the field at Giants Stadium long before the start of
Saturday night's game when several fans started a welcome home
chant. Actually, it was more of a welcome home curse, echoing
through the emptiness amid the early arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the game, there were more than 40,000 spectators
in the stands, but Harkes made it a point to acknowledge his small
group of detractors behind the goal by cupping a hand around his
ear, rebuking them as they sat in momentary stunned silence. The
Revolution had just spoiled the festive atmosphere, holding the
MetroStars to a 3-3 tie in regulation time, then winning the
shootout.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution might have surprised their own fans, as well,
since the team had been in a record scoring slump. And, after the
Revolution fell behind to the MetroStars in the opening minutes,
they seemed to be falling into their losing form. But Ivan McKinley
nodded in a goal off the inside of the left post in the 21st minute
to snap a 360-minute scoreless streak, and Giovanni Savarese scored
twice. McKinley's score, off a precisely chipped pass from Harkes,
was the first Revolution goal in the run of play in 405 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, the Revolution appeared out of character as they
surrendered more than two goals for the first time this season.
They squandered 2-1 and 3-2 advantages as the game degenerated in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wide-open game and we did well to go in front,'' said
Harkes, who is from Kearney, N.J. ``But we need to be tighter. We
can't be all over the place and giving up three goals. That was
disappointing. But it's a plus that we walked away with a point.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Revolution displayed some of their most coherent
midfield play for part of the first half and early in the second
half. Harkes solved the team's lack of effectiveness on the right
wing and Jair and Kris Kelderman helped coordinate the midfield,
though the Revolution required much of the first half to mesh in
midfield.
</P>
<P>
   This was in contrast to last week, a 1-0 loss at Los Angeles,
and an encouraging sign for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played together more and the more we do that the
better,'' Harkes said. ``But we need to force the ball into the box
more. Our forwards are making runs and the ball is not coming in.
We need to work on that more. Once we get to the (penalty area), we
seem to hesitate and we don't do the right things.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the MetroStars, maintaining possession was the right
thing to do, especially in the second half. The MetroStars were
attacking desperately, and the Revolution central defenders were
left isolated too often with Eduardo Hurtado and Nansha Kalonji.
With Mark Chung controlling the pace in midfield, the MetroStars
were the more dangerous team in the final third of the game as the
Revolution went to a siege strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have eight points in 10 matches, two points
behind last year's pace. But in their 10th match last season, the
Revolution lost in a shootout to the MetroStars and slid into a
nine-game losing streak that destroyed their credibility and nearly
ended their playoff hopes. Now, they are facing home matches
against defending MLS Cup champion Chicago (Saturday) and Miami
(June 13).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution continue to regain health as Mike Burns
(hamstring) played his first full game since April 24. ``I'm not
100 percent, but it was good for me to play 90 minutes,'' Burns
said. ``As a team we didn't play well defensively. We were having
trouble scoring, but then we score in this game and we can't hold
the lead. It's entertainment for the fans, but we have to do
better.'' . . . El Salvador surprised Colombia, 2-1, in the second
game of the doubleheader as midfielder Elias Montes converted a
spectacular bicycle kick early in the second half.

<P>
   PARIS _ Andre Agassi never has been the king of France, but he
might be, having behaved like a revolutionary with the guillotine
concession at Stade Roland Garros Sunday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30, racing desperately to his left, Agassi overtook a
fleeing yellow tennis ball and lofted it high into an azure evening
sky reminiscent of a French painting. Up, up it went, and Carlos
Moya began to run, too _ but it was no use. The ball descended
beyond him, falling like a fatal blade that severed King Carlos
from his kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Only minutes before, with 16,000 witnesses crammed into Court
Central screeching his name _ ``AG-AS-SI! AG-AS-SI!'' _ Agassi went
to the line to serve for a victory that had seemed out of reach
when he lagged a set and two service breaks to the rear, 4-6, 1-4.
But the husky Spaniard struck back fiercely to protect the crown,
almost taking Agassi's head off with a lusty forehand, and
shouldered him into a 0-40 corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd come too far not to step up my game one more time,''
Agassi said after rescuing four break points, closing a last-gap
threat with that brilliant lob and barging into the French Open
quarterfinals, 4-6, 7-5, 7-5, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to take it up a level when I was so far behind, and I
did,'' he said. He had leaped from a dungeon in the Bastille to
storming the joint and taking it apart. In doing so it seemed that
Agassi had flip-flopped a famous regal quote out of the 18th
century. King Louis XV said that after him a deluge would wash away
the royalty. But Sunday, after a deluge lashed Paris, flooding
streets and felling trees, Agassi took out the king himself.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, though favored, had failed in his final-round bids for
the throne against Andres Gomez in 1990 and Jim Courier in 1991.
Despite a spirited revival from a Grand Canyon plunge to No. 140
two years ago, and a return to the top 10 (now No. 14), he was
nevertheless stigmatized by flops in the majors. Not for three
years had he progressed as far as the quarters, that in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm well aware of that, and that I'm 29, and time's running
out. But I'm recommitted,'' Agassi said, his legs still shaking
from the excitement of deposing No. 4 Moya, the highest ranking of
the elite after the removals of Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Pete Sampras,
and Patrick Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still dreams I can accomplish,'' he said. ``This is
one dream.'' Merely four men have won all four majors _ Don Budge,
Fred Perry, Roy Emerson, Rod Laver _ and Agassi lacks only the
French to join them.
</P>
<P>
   Though the sun reappeared to create a gorgeous Sunday afternoon
for the 30,749 roaming the grounds, a curious Austrian deluge swept
away two female contenders _ No. 4 Jana Novotna and, yes, No. 5
Vibrant Venus Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, on a 10-match streak and wearing the badge of Italian
champion, became one of the tournament's larger upset victims,
letting No. 125 Barbara Schwartz escape three successive match
points. Schwartz, a 20-year-old from the Vienna suburb of Brunn am
Gebirge, struck a historic note as the lone female qualifier ever
to make the French quarters, 2-6, 7-6 (9-7), 6-3. ``Inspired by
Barbara,'' No. 34 Sylvia Plischke from Innsbruck then dropped
Wimbledon champ Novotna, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5).
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz also made journalistic history at home by breaking auto
racing's monopoly of the front sports page of the country's leading
paper, Neue Kronenzeitung, circulation 2.8 million. Considered a
jallopy in the tennis fast lane, she bumpered the Barcelona Formula
One story to the rear by flattening Williams's tires.
</P>
<P>
   Exulted Hermann Fuchs, the paper's tennis correspondent for 29
years, ``It never happened before for tennis to beat car racing.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5-6, 0-40, Schwartz brushed aside triple match point with her
own lefthanded daring and Williams's mistakes. ``I didn't know who
she was,'' confessed Williams, who added that none of her camp had
bothered to scout her. Williams's serve and footwork vanished.
Still she had a last chance, bungling a break point that would have
sent her ahead, 4-3, in the third.
</P>
<P>
   How many times did Agassi charge up ``Magic Mountain'' in Las
Vegas as he ``made up my mind to be in the best shape of my life''?
He smiles and says, ``We didn't count, but it was plenty. It's only
about 50 yards, but a pretty good incline that can make you burn.
Magic Mountain is what (trainer) Gil Reyes and I call it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no point in coming to Paris if you aren't
super-prepared physically,'' he said. Two years ago, his last
visit, Agassi was chided by the French for his ``poignees d'amour''
(love handles), and he was beaten in the second round by Chris
Woodruff.
</P>
<P>
   In the second round this time around, he came within two points
of losing to No. 81 Arnaud Clement, who eventually cramped in the
6-0 fifth set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did that to him, staying with him, moving him,'' Agassi
said.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed scrawny across the net from 6-3, 180-pound Moya and
was getting beaten up badly. At first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my work was done, two breaks ahead in the second
set,'' laments Moya. ``It was a bad mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Very bad, because Agassi was about to reach back to earlier
glories. ``We'd never played, and I was stunned by how heavy Carlos
hit. I knew I had to dictate. I had to get aggressive or I was
going home,'' Agassi said. He began to serve murderously and take
the ball earlier, practically half-volleying from the back court to
unbalance Moya. Quick-quick-quick. He started to play better than
he ever had in the hallowed 71-year-old dirt pit, driving Moya to
frustrated blunders.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with qualifier Marcelo Filippini, the conqueror of Greg
Rusedski, the next boulder in his way, Agassi is three wins from
summiting another magic mountain. That is a long way when you
consider that Marcelo Rios, Gustavo Kuerten, and Alex Corretja are
still in town.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, after hailstones pelted Paris, Andre Agassi did a
pretty fair imitation of Mother Nature as a shotmaking deluge.

KOSOVARS ADJUST TO SOUTHLAND LIVING

(EDITORS: This story contains information on making donations.) 
BY TROY ANDERSON AND PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With their Los Angeles culture-shock slowly
waning, 32 ethnic Albanian refugees from war-torn Kosovo have begun
their search for the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   The Vlashi family came from the blue-collar town of Hani-Elezit,
where a concrete factory was the major industry. Some were truck
drivers, security guards or supervisors. Others were skilled
craftsmen and professional musicians. The women were housewives.
</P>
<P>
   While the bloodshed and horrors of Kosovo remain fresh in their
minds, they've already taken steps to join America's working class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Thursday, they applied for their Social Security cards
and met with a vocational counselor,'' said Renee Vlashi of
suburban West Hills, whose husband sponsored his relatives as
immigrants. ``They have skills, and some of them will eventually
work. They're picking up English pretty quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Martin, who is hosting part of the Vlashi family in his
home in Simi Valley in neighboring Ventura County, said two of the
young women are working hard on their English and have become
attached to a typing tutor computer program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like in a couple of months they'll be full-fledged
American citizens,'' Martin said. ``They're typing about 10 words
per minute now, but they're getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   The search is on for at least four low-rent houses. Some of the
Vlashis will eventually find work, but until then they'll make due
with government aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have it all budgeted out. It's minimal living, but it's
doable,'' Renee Vlashi said.
</P>
<P>
   With only seven months of minimal government help available for
newly arrived Kosovar refugees, charities say they don't have
enough donations to keep them fed and housed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears we're going to need quite a few thousand dollars to
accomplish this,'' said Barbara Creme, director of the Jewish
Community Relations Committee at Jewish Federation/Valley Alliance
in West Hills. ``It's going to take a lot of time and patience. Our
first need is to get them into housing.''
</P>
<P>
   The 28 refugees, all extended relatives of Hajrush and Renee
Vlashi, arrived last week. Six families have agreed to house
Vlashi's relatives for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   About seven or eight more members of the Vlashi family are
expected to fly from the war-torn Balkans to Los Angeles soon. In
all, the federation expects to help assimilate about 60 refugees
into the San Fernando Valley area in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to learn English, the children have to be placed in
schools, and they all have to be evaluated vocationally,'' said
Shoshana Hirsh, assistant director of operations at the federation.
``We need translators who speak Albanian. We could use a very
generous landlord in the West Hills area.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the federation's policy not to release the amount of
donations it receives. Refugee assistance groups provide a month of
financial help to the group, but then the government provides
assistance for seven months.
</P>
<P>
   For seven months after the first month, the government puts
people with families in the CalWorks program or pays people without
children on a sliding scale. The average is $279 a person. For
families, the aid can be extended up to two years.
</P>
<P>
   To donate money, send a check to the Jewish Federation/Valley
Alliance, 22622 Vanowen St., West Hills, CA 91307. For more
information, call (818) 464-3203. To donate furniture, clothing,
toys and other items, call Maya Segal at the Jewish Federation of
Greater Los Angeles at (323) 761-8333.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic Relief agency in Burbank, the agency's United States
headquarters, is also helping Kosovo refugees assimilate into the
Los Angeles area. The agency has offered to sponsor about 100
families altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, the agency raised $300,000 at a fund-raising
dinner, said Abdelsalam Serajudeen, adviser for the crisis at
Islamic Relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not only for Muslims,'' he said. ``We have two major
camps (in the Balkans). We have spent more than $1 million in this
crisis so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Those wishing to help families sponsored by Islamic Relief can
send checks to the organization at P.O. Box 6098, Burbank, CA
91510. For more information, call (818) 238-9520.
</P>
<P>
   So far, people have donated clothes, toys, furniture and money
to the Jewish Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response to these refugees coming here has been so
gratifying,'' said Bonnie Somers, spokeswoman for the federation.
``People of all religions have come through to ask us what they
could do and have volunteered both their time and money.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirsh said that the federation received a big donation of
clothes from the City of Angels Church of Religious Science, an
African-American church in Los Angeles. ``They brought out a huge
amount of clothes for our refugees,'' she said. ``At this point, we
don't need any more clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   A donation of toys brought smiles to Ibrahim Vlashi, a young
refugee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have seen the 7-year-old boy who got the whole box
of trains and cars,'' Hirsh said. ``He was so thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   The families taking care of the refugees committed to a few
weeks but have become quite attached to the Vlashis, Creme said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of when they leave, but when they will
relinquish them,'' Creme said.

HARGROVE WOULDN'T MIND SEEING NO MORE NOMAR 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-GARCIAPARRA-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Indians manager Mike Hargrove said Sunday that sure,
he could have had pitcher Doc Gooden walk Nomar Garciaparra with
first base open in the third inning, when the Red Sox had runners
on second and third with two out in a scoreless game.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't, Hargrove said, because he doesn't like the idea
of intentional walks so early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to intentionally walk a guy in the third
inning,'' said Hargrove. ``Troy O'Leary was up next and he's hurt
us in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I entertained the thought, but it's tough to intentionally
walk somebody in the third inning. Doc had handled him the first
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when the alternative is a three-run home run, like
the 439-foot bomb Garciaparra dropped on Gooden Sunday, Hargrove
might want to reconsider. Especially in light of the damage
Garciaparra has inflicted on the Indians since he broke into the
big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who hit four home runs and had eight RBIs in the
three-game sweep, is batting .358 (49 for 137) with 10 homers and
36 RBIs against the Indians. That includes last October's four-game
playoff set, in which Garciaparra hit .333 with three homers and 11
RBIs. In six games against the Indians this season, Garciaparra is
batting .360 with four homers and 11 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, Gooden shook off catcher Einar Diaz, who was calling for
a curveball, and threw a fastball instead. ``I wanted to get it up
and in,'' Gooden said.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden's plan succeeded only halfway. The pitch was up, all
right, but over the plate and Garciaparra hit it just below the
huge Yard-Man tractor sign in left-center field, giving a new twist
to ``Going yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra said it wasn't for him to second-guess the Indians'
strategy. ``I'm not going to question any pitcher,'' he said.
``When I saw that they weren't going to do that (intentionally walk
him), I said, `All right, I've got to go out there and do my job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to connect on that one. If I had hit a fly ball,
people would have said he made a great pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The theory that opposing teams would not allow Garciaparra, as
the one big threat in the Sox lineup, to beat them has been
obliterated. With one day left in May, Garciapara has had one of
the finest months in his two-plus seasons to date. He's hitting
.349 with 10 home runs and 32 RBIs in 26 games, eclipsed only by
his July last season, when he hit .351 with 11 homers and 33 RBIs,
and there's still one day left this month.
</P>
<P>
   He's off to what is easily his best start in three seasons, his
.335 average 34 percentage points better than last season, and his
home run (10) and RBI totals (40 in 42 games) dwarf previous
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra may not fit the prototype of your classic cleanup
hitter, but he's leading the American League with a .691 slugging
percentage while hitting in the No. 4 spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nomar isn't very big,'' said Indians reliever Paul Shuey,
beaten on Saturday by a three-run home run by Garciaparra. ``It's
not like you're facing Jose Canseco. But he almost hits the ball
the same way as Canseco.''
</P>
<P>
   And while all his other stats are on the rise, Garciaparra's
errors and strikeouts are going down. Sunday's error, which came on
a tough chance, was just his fourth of the season; he made 25 last
season.
</P>
<P>
   His strikeout Sunday was just his 15th in 167 at-bats. Project
that out over the 604 at-bats he had last season, and Garciaparra
would finish with just 54 strikeouts, eight fewer than last season.

TRINIDAD IS IN A BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ The real war began for Felix Trinidad Saturday night
less than an hour after the battle was over.
</P>
<P>
   He had just defeated Hugo Pineda in startling fashion, knocking
him into submission with a left hook to the stomach that becalmed
the challenger, leaving him on the floor of Roberto Clemente
Coliseum unable to get up.
</P>
<P>
   Pineda was counted out at 2:53 of the fourth round as Trinidad
successfully defended the International Boxing Federation
welterweight title for the 13th time since he first won it six
years ago, but after the battle, the war began. The war between his
promoter and his father. The war between his best interests and his
financial interests. The war to make him a star perhaps had entered
its final struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad may be the best welterweight in the world, but he is
not paid like it nor does he draw fans like it. Not even in Puerto
Rico, where he is a native son, can he sell out an arena the way
his American rival, Oscar De La Hoya, can, and so he cannot be paid
like De La Hoya regardless of what he believes he will do to him if
they ever meet wearing gloved fists.
</P>
<P>
   Don King, who has promoted Trinidad throughout his career,
understands this. Trinidad's father, Felix Sr., appears not to. And
so the two have fought for nearly three weeks over how much
Trinidad must be paid to fight De La Hoya Sept. 18. It is an old
story, but King put a new twist on it as they sat together inside
the ring an hour after Pineda had fallen not 10 feet from where
their chairs rested.
</P>
<P>
   With a heavy contingent of Puerto Rican press in front of him,
King went to work at that moment to build a box for his boxer, a
box from which the boxer could not easily extricate himself without
agreeing to meet his greatest challenge at a price King could live
with.
</P>
<P>
   It was a master stroke, a combination of praise and perjury. It
was a moment of translucent treachery. It was King at his best and
his worst, using his mind to use his boxer both for his own gain
and his own good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight you saw the march to destiny,'' King began. ``Felix
`Tito' Trinidad showed the world how great he is. Now the march
toward Oscar has begun. There is no way we will stand in the way of
destiny. We are family. We may fight inside the house, but when we
come out to the street, we are unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every head must bow! Every knee must bend! Every tongue must
confess that Tito Trinidad is the best welterweight in the world!''
</P>
<P>
   At that, even members of the local press cheered, but over in
the corner Don Felix, the father, glowered and said nothing. His
son beamed, promising to destroy De La Hoya as he had Pineda,
saying he would begin training Monday, beaming like a young man who
has just discovered his destiny.
</P>
<P>
   King smiled, too, but it was the malevolent grin of a master
manipulator who knew a meeting was coming in a few hours, a loud
meeting without the son or the press present. It would be a meeting
between Don King and Don Felix in which all that would matter would
be money, of which Don Felix seems to want nearly all and Don King
seems to want too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tito's punch has spoken for him,'' said Nicholas Medina,
Trinidad's lawyer. ``He has sent a message to Oscar. We are ready
to take the fight, but it is in Don King's court now. It is about
the financial agreement and a little misunderstanding. We said
tonight Tito would show what he is worth. He showed he's worth $15
million!''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing the Trinidads' unwillingness to bargain further, King
then began a new tactic Saturday night. He put his fighter in a hot
box between his homeland and his accountant and by the time he was
done, for Trinidad to refuse to fight began to sound like an act of
treason, a man refusing to defend his people.
</P>
<P>
   ``A family dispute is not the message Tito wants to send to our
people,'' King said, suddenly Puerto Rican for a night. ``It is not
a message he wants to send to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seizing the time must be understood. This is Tito Time. It's
not about money. Certainly there's no more slavery. A man must get
paid for his labors. But this fight is about destiny. It's about
timing. We must all agree that Tito must fight Oscar. The message
has been sent. Tito is one of the greatest fighters in the world,
but the world will not recognize that until they fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon even the fighter was into it, standing up and pounding his
right fist into his chest and saying, ``I'm not worried about the
fight. I fight whoever I have to!
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, Oscar. I'm ready for you!''
</P>
<P>
   As Trinidad thundered his willingness to fight, King sat smiling
at his side. The representative of the people of Puerto Rico had
spoken. He'd also probably cost himself some money.

IT'S A NET LOSS FOR HARVARD'S BLAKE 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ James Blake's season is over. The Harvard
sophomore sensation and top-seeded player in the NCAA men's tennis
championships lost in Sundya's singles final to second-seeded Jeff
Morrison of Florida in a 7-6 (7-2), 2-6, 6-4 thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Fairfield, Conn., resident, who has been the top-ranked
collegiate player since Dec. 8, will decide whether Sunday's match
was his last at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure right now'' said Blake, who is considering
forgoing his final two years of eligibility to turn professional.
Sunday, he lost his bid to become the first Ivy League player to
win the title since 1922 and the second African- American to do so
(Arthur Ashe won while at UCLA in 1965).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking about going back to Boston, hanging out a few
days and giving my rackets to my parents to take home and not see
those for a little while,'' added Blake.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those three or four days I'm not going to think about it.
I'm just going to relax and, as soon as my parents come and pick me
up, I'm sure the talks will start in the car. Then the next week is
going to be hectic talking to a lot of people. I will probably make
the decision within three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeat also marked the third time Blake failed to reach the
main draw of the US Open. Two years ago he lost in the USTA
national boys' 18-and-under championships in the final round, a
match where, like Sunday, the winner gets an automatic wild card
into the Open. Last year, he lost in the last round of the US Open
qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
   USTA officials say Blake still can apply for a US Open main draw
wild card based on his results this season and what he does this
summer in satellite matches.
</P>
<P>
   Blake got off to a decent start but never looked as sharp
against Morrison, a sophomore whose second-set defeat was his first
in the tournament. Blake went ahead, 4-2, in the first set and was
up, 30-0, in the seventh game before Morrison rallied to take the
next four points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had chances, but in a match like this you only
get a few opportunities. A couple of times I didn't capitalize,''
said Blake, who forced a tiebreaker by taking the next game only to
see Morrison take the first three points of the extra frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of times (Morrison) came up with really big shots
that made all the difference in the match,'' said Blake. ``The
shots were just falling for him today.''
</P>
<P>
   They began falling for Blake in the second set. He held Morrison
without a point in three games and finished out the set with a
solid forehand cross-court winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second set, he stepped up his game a little bit, and I
started getting a bit tired,'' said Morrison. ``He was making me
run a bit and my legs started to go. I wasn't getting a lot of
first serves in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told myself going into the third set that I have one
more set for the national title and `If you can't find it now, I
don't know if you will ever be able to find it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison broke a 2-2 tie by taking the next three games,
including the second after Blake mistimed an overhand attempt at
the net. Blake captured the next two sets to break Morrison's
service, and it appeared they were headed for another tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   But Blake figured Morrison anticipated the same and backed off a
bit. ``At that point, I think I may have gotten a little relaxed
thinking I was just going to hold there, but he wasn't thinking
that at all,'' said Blake. ``That shouldn't have gone through my
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Morrison wasted no time closing out the match. He got
Blake to hit into the net for three consecutive points, then
captured the title on a passing shot from near the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done my share of winning, and I have to do my share of
losing to start winning some more,'' said Blake, one of six named
to the 1999 USA Tennis Collegiate Team, along with Morrison. ``I'm
upset about the fact I didn't win, but I'm going to just
congratulate him, move on, and enjoy the rest of the week.''

THINGS DIVINE IN PROVIDENCE? 
</HEADLINE>
 LEAGUE NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY VAN HANDLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They've been as close to perfect as a team can be,
compiling the American Hockey League's best regular-season record
before sweeping one series and losing only three playoff games thus
far. Three of their players were named first-team AHL All-Stars,
and their aura is such that someone who joined the team just before
the start of the playoffs scored three straight game-winning goals.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Providence Bruins wait to see whom they will play for
the Calder Cup, beginning next weekend, to fully appreciate how far
they've come, it's necessary to look back and see where they have
been.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Providence was as far from the postseason as a team
can be. The Bruins were long since home for the summer, finishing
with only 19 wins and the league's worst record. With attendance in
freefall after missing the playoffs for a second straight year,
management realized it had to take steps to rectify the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Step 1 was hiring a new coach. Peter Laviolette, a
player-assistant coach with Providence during the 1996-97 season,
was plucked out of the East Coast Hockey League after a year as
Wheeling's general manager-coach.
</P>
<P>
   Step 2, simply adding talent to the roster, was achieved by
signing several free agents, including Brandon Smith, Marquis
Mathieu, Terry Virtue, Peter Ferraro, and Dennis Vaske, all AHL
veterans. Mixed with rookies like Eric Nickulas and Andre Savage,
plus returnees such as Landon Wilson, Randy Robitaille, Cameron
Mann, Joel Prpic, Aaron Downey, and John Grahame, a competitive
club began to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   With Laviolette in command behind the bench, the Bruins set
dozens of team and AHL records over the regular season on the way
to a 56-20-4 finish, their 120 points by far the best in the league
_ and an astonishing 70 points better than last year's total. At
one juncture, the Baby B's didn't lose for well over a month, going
15-0-1.
</P>
<P>
   It's been more of the same during the playoffs. Providence
dropped just one game in its opening-round series against
Worcester, then swept aside Hartford in four straight. After going
up, 3-0, against Fredericton, the Bruins polished off the Canadiens
in six games as Ferraro scored the first of his two goals just 12
seconds in, leading the Baby B's to a 6-1 victory Saturday night at
the Providence Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 playoff victories added to its regular-season wins
enabled Providence to break an AHL record: the total of 67 is three
better than the old mark.
</P>
<P>
   With Wilson and AHL Most Valuable Player Robitaille joining
Smith as first-team All-Stars, Virtue named to the second team, and
the Baby B's boasting seven 20-goal scorers during the regular
season, it was an unlikely player who has given the team a
postseason shot in the arm. John Spoltore, sent for from Louisiana
(ECHL) after Robitaille was recalled to Boston during the parent
club's first-round series, scored the winning goal in each of the
first three games of Providence's second-round sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Spoltore led the Coast in regular-season scoring with 36 goals
and 77 assists, but at age 27 encountered a familiar curse _ being
considered too small and slow _ to play above the ECHL level.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's become a big part of what's going on with us,''
Laviolette told the Providence Journal-Bulletin. ``I guess I'm
going to keep putting him out there. When he's out there, things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoltore has six goals in all, while Nickulas is leading the AHL
in postseason scoring at 8-11_19, and Robitaille has 16 points,
including five goals.
</P>
<P>
   Grahame, who assumed the No. 1 goalie's job after Jim Carey was
released in March, has been rock-solid during the postseason after
posting a league-best 37 regular-season victories. Playing every
playoff minute thus far, Grahame is 11-3.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins do win the Calder Cup, it will mark the first time
the city of Providence has earned a championship since 1956.
Doesn't that make the parent club's 27-year drought seem a little
less severe?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the AHL's form-following playoffs, there seems to be at
least one preposterous story in each postseason. The International
Hockey League has this season's doozy in the Orlando Solar Bears,
who rallied from a 3-0 deficit to earn a spot in the finals against
the Houston Aeros. After tying their semifinal series at three
games apiece against Detroit, Orlando appeared dead in the water
before scoring twice in the last three minutes of Game 7 to tie the
score, then won in double overtime on a goal by Todd Krygier to
deny the Vipers a chance to win their second championship in three
years. Goalie David Littman (Boston College) and center Hubie
McDonough (St. Anselm) are two thirtysomething vets who have lent a
steadying hand to Orlando's postseason push. The Solar Bears will
have to mount another comeback if they are to win the Turner Cup;
regular-season champ Houston holds a 3-1 lead . . . Marty Turco was
named IHL Rookie of the Year after compiling a 24-17-10 record with
a 2.61 goals-against average and save percentage of 92 for
Michigan. The former University of Michigan goalie is property of
the Dallas Stars . . . The ECHL championship is down to a seventh
game with the series between Richmond and Mississippi tied, 3-3.
Helping send Richmond to the final was UMass's Sal Manganaro, whose
winning goal in the fourth game of the semifinals completed a sweep
. . . Former New Hampshire star Mark Mowers earned IHL top US-born
rookie honors with 14-22_36 numbers in 51 games with Milwaukee.
Mowers also saw significant action in the NHL with Nashville, with
whom he signed as a free agent before the season. Utah's Rob
Bonneau, a former UMass standout, was second . . . Dave Hymovitz
was a second-team selection at left wing to the IHL's postseason
all-star squad. The former Boston College standout ranked second in
the league with 46 goals for Indianapolis . . . For the second time
in three years, Houston's Greg Hawgood earned honors as the top
defenseman in the ``I.'' The former Bruin had 74 points and led all
IHL blueliners with 13 power-play goals.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rarely do minor leagues stand pat from season to season, and the
AHL is no exception. Two expansion teams, Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and
Louisville, Ky., will be joining the league, and Fredericton will
become the Quebec Citadelles next year. Adirondack, a league member
for 20 years, will shut down operations for a year before moving to
Rossmore, Ohio, for the 2000-01 season, joining Hampton Roads, Va.
Amid all the changes, it's significant to note that the term
``large market,'' common in the major leagues, has begun to creep
into minor league vernacular and applies to about half of next
season's AHL teams, which will play in arenas that seat more than
10,000 . . . Musical affiliations: Lowell will have a new parent
club in Los Angeles next season, though the New York Islanders will
continue to use the Lock Monsters as a secondary team. With the
Kings switching to Lowell, Springfield will go with Phoenix as its
sole affiliate. Worcester recently signed a five-year deal to
continue with St. Louis, and Portland dropped Chicago as a
secondary feeder but will maintain its relationship with
Washington.

BEHRENS FINALLY NOTICED 
</HEADLINE>
 CAP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Behrens, whose accomplishments in the handicap ranks
hadn't exactly set the racing industry on fire, beat a hot horse
when he defeated Real Quiet, last year's Kentucky Derby and
Preakness winner, in Saturday's $600,000 Massachusetts Handicap at
Suffolk Downs. Now maybe Behrens will be noticed.
</P>
<P>
   The MassCap marked the third straight major victory for Behrens,
a son of Pleasant Colony, who came to Boston off tallies in the
Gulfstream Park Handicap Feb. 27 and the Oaklawn Handicap April 3.
Next for Behrens, who is trained by Jim Bond and ridden by Jorge
Chavez, could be the $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup June 27, which
would mean another meeting with Real Quiet. The winner of the
Pimlico Special May 8, Real Quiet finished third in the MassCap
after falling back from a three-horse battle that included European
invader Running Stag, who just missed going gate-to-wire. Behrens,
the second choice at 9-10 ($3.80 to win), covered the mile and
one-eighth in 1:49 to prevail by a half-length.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great race,'' said Bond Sunday. ``The English horse
really ran a terrific race. To be in the same league as Cigar and
Skip Away, it's an honor. I'm hoping to come back next year and try
it again. I'd like to be able to repeat in the MassCap, like those
two (Cigar won in 1995 and '96, Skip Away in 1997 and '98). I told
the owners (the Rudlein Stable and William Clifton) we'd be right
there, that we just might be favored over Real Quiet (who was the
choice at 4-5). I think that most people know when we point for a
race, six or seven weeks out, we are aiming to win it, and that
we'll run well.''
</P>
<P>
   Behrens was the leader of the National Thoroughbred Racing
Association's Champions series entering the MassCap, and he picked
up six more points with the triumph, for a total of 28. NTRA series
points can be worth up to $5,000 each, depending on how a horse
runs in the $1 million Pacific Classic at Del Mar Aug. 29, the
concluding event in the series. The Hollywood Gold Cup is worth 20
points, and that may be enough to lure Bond from his Saratoga
sanctuary, where he is stabled, even though Behrens doesn't like to
ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to talk to the owners, get back and see the horse, and
see what his next couple of workouts look like,'' said Bond. ``But
I'm thinking of the Hollywood Gold Cup or the Suburban (at Belmont
July 5, which also is in the series, but offers six points). As
I've been saying, our long-term goal is the Breeders' Cup.'' That's
at Gulfstream Park Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The MassCap contestants came out of the race in good shape.
Behrens was vanned back to Saratoga Saturday night and arrived
safely Sunday morning. ``He's out here on the grass,'' said
assistant trainer Maxine Owen. ``He's happy.'' Real Quiet and
Running Stag, who might come right back in the Stephen Foster at
Churchill Downs June 12 against Silver Charm and Victory Gallop,
vanned to Belmont Park Sunday morning . . . Suffolk, which closes
Saturday, will offer Fan Appreciation Day Wednesday. Admission and
preferred parking will be free.

GORDON RUNS OUT OF GAS AT END 
</HEADLINE>
 500-GORDON-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Robby Gordon knew he had the fastest car in
Sunday's 83d running of the Indianapolis 500. After all, it was the
car Greg Ray used as his backup and recorded the fastest official
lap (227.192 miles per hour) in the week of practice leading up to
last weekend's time trials.
</P>
<P>
   As he toured the 2.5-mile oval at Indianapolis Motor Speedway
with one blistering lap after another, driving relentlessly toward
his first Indy 500 victory, Gordon didn't know if he had enough
fuel in his car to carry him across the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon radioed his crew: Should he pit with the rest of the
leaders on Lap 170? Was it worth it to stay out and vault to the
lead? Would he have enough fuel in his 35-gallon tank to make it to
the end?
</P>
<P>
   ``Fuel is OK,'' came the reply from Gordon's co-owner, John
Menard. ``Don't worry about it. Just drive, drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon did, but his car sputtered and ran out of fuel with one
lap remaining, delivering Sunday's Indy 500 victory to Kenny Brack.
</P>
<P>
   It was the culmination of a whirlwind weekend for Gordon, who
pulled double duty by driving in Saturday's Motorola 300 CART
series race in Madison, Ill., where he finished 27th after crashing
on Lap 11. He sustained a bruised right calf, but appeared none
worse for the wear Sunday after finishing fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost got one,'' said Menard, who has invested millions in
his quest for an elusive Indy 500 title. ``We could have come in on
the yellow and been in a nice position, but we finished fourth with
all the wheels on it. It could have been worse. Our car showed that
we had enough fuel, but how many times does this race go the last
25 laps without a yellow?''
</P>
<P>
   Menard gambled it wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept praying for a yellow,'' Menard said, managing a weak
smile. ``But we put on a spectacle for the fans. That's what racing
is all about. I love it. If I live long enough, one of these days,
I'm gonna win this race. But you know hindsight is 20/20. We did
what we did. If there had been a yellow, we'd be drinking milk and
having a great time. But we're still having a great time. We had a
great time today.''
</P>
<P>
   It would've been better had a yellow flag come out.
</P>
<P>
   But one never did, leaving Gordon to try and wring out every
last bit of fuel from his tank. Gordon said his fuel gauge showed
there were 2.3 gallons left. ``That was enough for one lap,'' he
said. ``And I ran out in Turn 4. But I figured I could've used .3
gallons just getting the car back to the start/finish line to take
the white flag and the next two to maybe make it all the way around
and just coast home in Turn 4. It just wasn't our day.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was left to deal with the disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I want to sit here and cry,'' he said, his voice
cracking. ``But what can you do? It's not going to change the way
things are going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, rationalizing, Gordon said, ``I could go and kick the car,
but that's not going to do anything except make John mad at me. I
could go and punch one of the guys on the crew for not putting
enough fuel in the car, but what's that going to do? We have
another race to go, and we've got to suck it up, and get over it,
and do everything we can, like we did this year, to try and win the
500.''

MO STEPS UP FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Mo Vaughn looks at the empty seats every night
and knows there is only one way to fill them.
</P>
<P>
   Drama helps, of course, but winning is more important and Vaughn
provided both Sunday night with a three-run homer that gave the
Anaheim Angels a 4-3 victory over the Kansas City Royals in front
of 31,429 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   For Vaughn, it was his 13th of the year, fourth in the past five
games and ninth in the last 18. But he knows he is only a novelty
act if the Angels don't win games like this against opponents
struggling to reach .500 like they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Boston the fans showed up whether we won or lost and you
would get spoiled,'' said Vaughn, who now has 38 RBI in his first
36 games with the club. ``Here you have to win to get fans to come
out and maybe that's the way it should be. You should never take
anything for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching Vaughn miss the first three weeks of the season
with a sprained left ankle, manager Terry Collins knows he'll never
look at his designated hitter that way. Not with Tim Salmon, Jim
Edmonds and Gary DiSarcina on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Not with the 24-26 team struggling to score runs and division
rivals Texas and Seattle starting to play well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a marvel just to watch him,'' Collins said. ``His
preparation and his determination are incredible. Every night he
shows us why we got him.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's fifth-inning shot made a winner out of Omar Olivares,
who pitched eight innings for his team-leading sixth victory. Troy
Percival came on in the ninth to record his 14th save. Percival,
who allowed a bases-clearing double in Saturday night's game, now
has three saves on this homestand that continues tonight against
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn credited Olivares and Darin Erstad, who emerged from a
slump with a leadoff home run in the first against Royals
left-hander Jose Rosado. Vaughn also cited the production of No.2
hitter Randy Velarde, who went 3 for 4 batting in front of him and
has five hits in the past two games, both victories.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake about who the hero was. Royals manager Tony
Muser didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo Vaughn is going to be in the Hall of Fame,'' he said. ``If
you set the table for him, this is what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosado, who entered the game 4-0 against the Angels lifetime
with a 2.38 ERA, agreed. He liked the pitch he threw, a fastball in
on the hands. Vaughn crowds the plate but got the head of his
36-ounce bat out quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want him to beat you, but I would throw that pitch
again, right in the same spot,'' Rosado said. ``It was right where
I wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could not be said on Erstad's homer.
</P>
<P>
   After going 2 for 18 to start this homestand, Erstad led off the
Angels first determined to make contact. He fouled off six pitches
before turning on a 2-2 fastball and driving it into the
right-field stands for his fifth home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was his best at-bat of the season,'' Collins said. ``He
battled at a time of the game when you can't see the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Velarde followed with a base hit, but Rosado settled down to
retire 12 of the next 14 batters.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals, who dropped below .500 after Saturday's 4-3 loss,
couldn't get anything going against Olivares. He was 0-4 lifetime
against Kansas City, but for most of the game kept the hitters off
balance.
</P>
<P>
   His only trouble spots came in the fifth and the eighth. Leading
1-0, Olivares walked three batters in the fifth and designated
hitter Mike Sweeney blooped a two-run single to right to give the
Royals a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by Vaughn's three-run homer in the bottom of the
fifth, Olivares retired nine consecutive batters before Jermaine
Dye hit his 11th homer with two out in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   He turned the game over to Percival. Unlike Saturday night, the
Royals didn't rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting that final out, that is the most rewarding thing for
me,'' Vaughn said. ``They brought me here to do a job, It's not
going to happen every night, but I don't look at it as pressure. I
see it as fun.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim Angels manager Terry Collins cringed
when Omar Olivares walked three batters in the fifth inning Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Collins had his bullpen busy, but he knew he had his most
consistent starter on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares allowed a two-run bloop single to Mike Sweeney, but
lasted eight innings and used Mo Vaughn's three-run homer to beat
the Kansas City Royals 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't always sharp, especially that inning, but usually he
was around the plate enough to keep him out there,'' Collins said.
``He gave us eight innings and got us to (Troy Percival). That is
all we can ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   The matchup between Olivares and the Royals' Jose Rosado was
curious. Olivares was 0-4 lifetime against Kansas City, Rosado was
4-0 vs. the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't just Vaughn's home run that made the difference.
Olivares spoke to pitching coach Dick Pole after the fifth and made
some adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick got him to stay aggressive and to stay with his sinker,''
Collins said. ``He got away from that a little but his performance
tonight gave us a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares, who hasn't lost since May 7, was coming off a 4-1
victory over Baltimore, where he lasted eight innings and allowed
just one run. He is the only Angels pitcher to throw a complete
game this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for one bad inning, I was pleased,'' Olivares said. ``I
went away from my sinker, but after Vaughn's home run I got focused
again. I wanted to finish the game, but I got us to Troy and that's
what matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Unsung hero: Randy Velarde is batting in front of Vaughn, which
means plenty of fastballs. Pitchers don't want to risk putting
Velarde on base and give Vaughn another chance for an RBI.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two games, both victories, that has translated into
five hits in eight at-bats. Sunday night it meant a two-out single
in the fifth that kept the inning alive and set up Vaughn's homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is making contact and taking advantage of the situation,''
Vaughn said. ``That is why this is such a team game. If he doesn't
do his job, I never get a chance to do mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Darin Erstad's leadoff homer in the first marked the
second time this season an Angels player has opened a game with a
home run. Orlando Palmeiro did it April 9 vs. Texas.... Steve
Decker, who was leading the Triple-A Pacific Coast League with 12
homers when his contract was purchased May 21, batted cleanup
Sunday and went 0 for 3. ``The reason I did that was because I
wanted a right-handed bat between Mo and Garret (Anderson),''
Collins said. ``He showed in the minors that he has some pop. He is
a quality hitter.''

Jones' affiliation with Nike reflects growing trend in recruiting
battles
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DANNY ROBBINS
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   As the University of Iowa assistant football coach responsible
for recruiting in the Houston area last year, Gene Jones brought a
wealth of experience and perspective to the job.
</P>
<P>
   A native Houstonian, Jones had coached track or football at the
college level for 20 years. In four years as Iowa's recruiting
coordinator and wide receivers and tight ends coach, he had been in
the hunt for numerous high school stars and had lured his share to
Iowa City.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing in his experience had prepared him for what he
encountered when he tried to sign Joel Harris, a defensive lineman
from Angleton who was one of the state's top recruits in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this business, you're always competing against the Notre
Dames, the Colorados, the Texas A&AMP;Ms for the services of a young
man,'' he said. ``But, Lord knows, you don't think you have to deal
with a shoe company.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting Harris meant dealing with Elaine Jones, director of
the Nike-backed Houston Jaguars summer basketball program. And
dealing with her, according to Gene Jones, meant hearing how
important it was for Harris to play for a college team with the
Nike Swoosh on its shoes and jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Jones said Elaine Jones presented herself as being the
legal guardian of Harris and his older brother, James, a basketball
player at the University of Memphis, and stated repeatedly how
Joel's interests would be best served by attending a school
affiliated with Nike.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hayden Fry, Iowa's head football coach for 20 years before
his retirement at the end of last season, the Hawkeyes football
program was affiliated with Reebok.
</P>
<P>
   Harris ultimately signed with Colorado, a school that has been
heavily involved with Nike since entering into a sponsorship
agreement with the shoe giant valued at $6 million five years ago.
Red-shirted last season, Harris is projected to be a backup nose
tackle for the Buffaloes this year.
</P>
<P>
   Examining Elaine Jones' involvement in Harris' recruitment, the
Chronicle found she signed the player's Colorado letter of intent
as his legal guardian with no legal or written authority to do so.
</P>
<P>
   One of several Iowa assistants who lost their positions when Fry
departed, Gene Jones talked recently about Iowa's bid to sign
Harris as if it is something he will not soon forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had migraine headaches after that particular recruiting
episode,'' he said, ``because that Nike thing kept coming up in our
face. I'd never had that happen to me in all the years I'd been
recruiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' conduct is a window to the role a shoe company can play
in directing an elite high school athlete to a favored college.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly relevant in college basketball, where NCAA rules
have put a premium on summer recruiting and shoe companies and
their surrogates have gained extraordinary influence, the issue is
not a new one in college sports or in the world of Elaine Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana coach Bob Knight, in an interview with former Notre Dame
coach Digger Phelps broadcast by ESPN in January, called the
involvement of shoe companies in recruiting ``as bad a thing as has
happened in college basketball in the last 10 years'' and
illustrated his point with an apparent reference to Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our assistant coaches asked a woman from Texas about the
possibility of a kid on the team she's sponsoring perhaps being
interested in coming to Indiana,'' Knight told Phelps. ``Her first
question was, `Well, what shoe does Indiana wear?' Our coaches
said, `Well, we wear Converse shoes.' Her answer was, `Well, I'm
really partial to coaches who wear Nike shoes.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Nike is pumping money into this program, in what they call
their `grass-roots' program, and the return for them is that the
sponsor is going to direct anybody on that team who might have the
wherewithal to play college basketball to a school that wears Nike
shoes, going all the way up to the chance that if this kid becomes
a professional prospect he is so heavily involved with Nike that
Nike gets the (endorsement) contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike spokesman Dean Stoyer said the company frowns on its
representatives pushing athletes to colleges with Nike ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to see kids have the opportunity to play sports
and get an education,'' he said. ``What kind of shoes a school
wears should not have an impact on that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight did not respond to interview requests for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' involvement with Joel Harris was rooted in her ties to
his older brother, James.
</P>
<P>
   The two brothers were born in the Virgin Islands and raised in
Angleton by their mother, Violet Harris, a certified nurse's aide.
</P>
<P>
   James Harris, 6 feet 9 inches and 240 pounds, played basketball
at Angleton High School and became part of Jones' program in the
summer of 1995. Following that summer, he moved to Westbury
Christian School in Houston for his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   At Westbury Christian, Harris joined a team that included Jones'
nephew, Trey Austin, and helped the Wildcats win the Texas
Association of Private and Parochial Schools (TAPPS) Class 2A state
title.
</P>
<P>
   Westbury Christian coach Greg Glenn said Jones approached him
about taking Harris, citing the fact the player needed an
``environment'' similar to that of her nephew. According to Glenn,
Jones said she had been ``granted authority from the mother'' to
enroll James at the school.
</P>
<P>
   As a TAPPS school, Westbury Christian is not subject to the
residency and eligibility requirements imposed on the athletic
programs at Texas' public high schools by the University
Interscholastic League.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his year at Westbury Christian, Harris signed with
the University of Texas-El Paso, a school with a basketball program
affiliated with Nike, but never enrolled, choosing instead to
attend the University of Memphis, also a Nike school. He sat out a
year at Memphis and became eligible in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of Harris' UTEP letter of intent, obtained by the
Chronicle from the school under the Texas Open Records Act, shows
Jones signed the document in the place designated for the player's
parent or legal guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Joel (pronounced Jo-El) Harris, a 6-3, 275-pound defensive
lineman, lost his eligibility to play high school football at
Angleton as a senior in 1997 because of a mixup over his age but
was regarded as one of the state's premier college prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Although he remained enrolled at Angleton for the 1997-98 school
year, he spent much of his time at Jones' home in Sugar Land,
according to Mark Wright, Angleton's football coach.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said he directed all inquiries about Harris from college
football coaches to Jones at Harris' request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the mother (Violet Harris) a couple of times but
never talked to her,'' Wright said. ``I always tried to get in
touch with her. Then at one point Joel told me, `Coach, my other
mother is the one who's handling everything. If you need anything,
call her.' That's what he always called her (Jones) _ his `other
mother.'''
</P>
<P>
   For Gene Jones, the former Iowa assistant coach, the situation
quickly turned frustrating due to Elaine Jones' constant references
to the fact the Hawkeyes were affiliated with Reebok and not Nike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept trying to ask, in a polite way, `What's the difference
whether he's wearing Nike or Reebok shoes? What influence does Nike
have on his coming to any institution and being able to play
football, get an education, get a degree?''' he said. ``She would
say things like, `Well, I know if he went to a Nike school, if the
coaches weren't treating him right, all I'd have to do is call Nike
and they would check into it, make sure he's being treated right.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Ma'am, I don't care whether it's Reebok or Nike, he's
going to be treated right by most institutions, and, if he's not,
you can come in and check yourself. I don't see how a shoe company
is going to do that.' She'd say, `Well, I'm loyal to them (Nike),
and they've been loyal to me. I'd feel good about them taking care
of it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We went round and round. She'd keep saying, `He really likes
you guys and stuff, but I don't know. The sticking point is you
guys are Reebok.'''
</P>
<P>
   Annoying as the situation might have been, it didn't cause Iowa
to stop recruiting Harris, Gene Jones said, because the player
seemed genuinely interested in attending the university. According
to the former Hawkeyes assistant, Harris had a good visit to Iowa
and indicated he would visit Colorado only because of his ``mom.''
</P>
<P>
   When Harris informed Iowa of his decision to attend Colorado,
Gene Jones said, he cited the relationships he had formed with
several members of the CU coaching staff and the fact his ``mom''
wanted him to attend a Nike school.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Colorado and Nike entered into a six-year sponsorship
agreement. Under terms of the deal, described in depth under the
heading ``CU and Nike'' in the school's 1998 football media guide,
Nike provides the CU athletic department with equipment and
financial support, including $2.7 million in cash over the course
of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hundley, who recruited Harris as an assistant coach at
Colorado and has since moved to the University of Washington, said
he knew the Iowa coaches believed Jones was trying to direct Harris
to a Nike school but never felt that way himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a pretty good heart, I think,'' he said. ``Beyond
that, I don't know. It's hard to read personalities in that amount
of time. I just always thought she was somebody who cared (about
young people). She wasn't going the extra mile for Joel because of
his future. He was an older kid who hadn't played the year
before.''
</P>
<P>
   When Harris signed with Colorado during a ceremony at the
Angleton Independent School District office, Jones was a
participant, but Violet Harris, the player's mother, was not
present.
</P>
<P>
   During the ceremony, Jones was photographed signing Harris'
letter of intent.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing her sons' relationship with Jones recently, Violet
Harris said she signed a document giving Jones ``parental guidance
or custody or something'' relating to James, her eldest son, but
had done nothing in that regard for Joel.
</P>
<P>
   She said she suggested that something be put in writing giving
Jones the authority to act on James' behalf after an incident in
which James, then attending Westbury Christian, needed medical
attention in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she was aware that Jones had signed James' UTEP letter
of intent, Violet Harris said she did not know her eldest son had
even signed with the school ``until you just told me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she never signed anything giving Jones parental
authority for Joel, she said she had no problem with Jones handling
his recruitment and signing his Colorado letter of intent as his
legal guardian.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows more about sports than I do,'' she said. ``I want my
children in her hands.''
</P>
<P>
   A national letter of intent is essentially a contract stopping
the recruiting process and binding a recruit and a school for one
academic year. Letters of intent are administered by the Collegiate
Commissioners Association and not the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   According to Carl Hicks, a Southeastern Conference assistant
commissioner and the Collegiate Commissioners Association's
administrator for the National Letter of Intent program, the
individual signing a letter of intent as a legal guardian must at
the very least have something in writing from one of the
student-athlete's natural parents.
</P>
<P>
   If the individual signing a letter of intent as a
student-athlete's parent or legal guardian does not have the
standing to do so and the student-athlete has yet to enroll, the
letter can be declared null and void, Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   Violet Harris, in her portrayal of Jones, also spoke of a woman
with virtually no limits to her generosity.
</P>
<P>
   According to Violet Harris, Jones helped James Harris purchase
two vehicles _ including a van on his 21st birthday _ paid his
tuition at Westbury Christian and helped with his tuition at the
University of Memphis when he was enrolled at the school without a
scholarship in his first year.
</P>
<P>
   She said Jones also has been paying James' apartment rent in
Memphis during the 1998-99 school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``God sent an angel to me,'' she said. ``I don't care what
anybody says about her.''
</P>
<P>
   The assistance described by Violet Harris might conflict with
NCAA regulations regarding the amateurism of student-athletes and
could impact her son's eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   According to Steve Mallonee, an NCAA director of membership
services, student-athletes at NCAA schools are barred from
receiving cash, vehicles and other items of value based on their
athletic ability.
</P>
<P>
   He said the rules allow student-athletes to receive such
benefits from individuals upon whom they are naturally or legally
dependent or individuals with whom they have relationships that
predate the recruiting process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (NCAA) membership believes if you get something from
someone who is truly an established family friend, someone you knew
before you became a good athlete or a (college) prospect, there's
no reason to question it,'' he said. ``But when individuals are
attaching themselves to kids later in the process, after they are
of prospect age and the relationship is developing out of
athletics, then the benefits involved have to be scrutinized.''

LONG BEACH ST. RUNS OUT OF PITCHING
</HEADLINE>
 BEACH-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ You don't mess with Texas, the folks in
these parts like to say, and on Sunday Long Beach State's Dirtbags
got a thorough lesson in good ol' boy hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   Needing to win one game to take that next big step on the road
to Omaha and the College World Series, the Dirtbags lost twice to
Texas A&AMP;M, in resounding fashion, too, and now they go home, their
season ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies (50-15) rebounded mightily from their loss Saturday
to the 49ers to win Sunday afternoon, 9-5, and force a deciding
game Sunday night in the double-elimination NCAA Regional
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies wasted little time taking command, spinning the
Dirtbags for an eight-run third inning on their way to a 17-7
victory and a berth in next weekend's Super Regional against
Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   The Dirtbags ended their season 35-25 and with little doubt
where to place their emphasis for next season: pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies took apart the 49ers' two starters, Kasey Olenberger
and Russel Rohlicek, pounding out 11 hits in the first game, 19 in
the second.
</P>
<P>
   The loss matched the 49ers' most-lopsided setback all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran into a buzz saw,'' understated Dave Snow, the 49ers'
coach. ``I tip my hat to the Texas Aggies. I know what it's like to
experience the joy of winning two games on Sunday, because we did
that last year.''
</P>
<P>
   That was at Stanford, where the Dirtbags stormed out of the
loser's bracket to eliminate North Carolina State, then Alabama,
and move on to the CWS. There was no such storm this time around,
except by the Aggies' batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really exposed our shortage of pitching,'' acknowledged
Snow. ``It was like we were playing the extra game, not Texas
A&AMP;M.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Aggies, didn't use more than two pitchers in any of
the five games they played, and two were complete games. The
Dirtbags, in four games, never used fewer than three. And not one
starter lasted past the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the championship game Sunday night, the Dirtbags actually
broke out on top, leading, 3-0, after 2{ innings, with a run in the
first inning and two more in the top of the third. But they
couldn't muster a knockout blow either inning, leaving the bases
loaded in the first, then two more in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``That took the air out of us little,'' Snow said, sizing up the
turnaround first inning, when right fielder Daylan Holt robbed Abel
Orozco, crashing against the wall for the third out. ``That was a
big momentum swing right there.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a bigger one in the third inning. That's when it all
came crashing down on the Dirtbags.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen Aggies paraded to the plate in the wild third, and eight
of them scored, four on Steven Truitt's grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of three homers off of reliever Jason Berni,
who took over for Rohlicek in the third inning. It was the fourth
homer of the Regional by tournament MVP Truitt, all of them against
the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies jumped on Berni again in the fifth. Holt followed an
error and a walk with his 32nd home run, giving him four RBI for
the game, 11 for the tournament --- and an incredible 98 for the
season, a Texas A&AMP;M record. John Scheschuk followed with his ninth
homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies poured it on, with two more runs in the seventh
inning and two more in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The Dirtbags might have avoided Saturday night's embarrassment
had their defense stayed together better in the first game Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the wobbly start by Olenberger --- he gave up four runs
on four hits, six walks and three hit batters in just five innings
--- the 49ers actually had a one-run lead an inning after he left.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Dobbs' 10th homer of the season and third of the
tournament, a two-blow in the bottom of the sixth, lifted the
Dirtbags on top, 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   But Dobbs' throwing error and a passed ball on catcher Mike Hota
led to two unearned runs in the seventh off of reliever Dan Thomas
(0-3), who absorbed the loss; Dobbs' second error of the game
helped produce two more runs in the eighth, and the Aggies added
one more in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Texas A&AMP;M's Khalid Ballouli, a freshman right-hander,
slammed the door on the Dirtbags after Dobbs' homer, retiring the
next 10 batters in order and allowing only more hit for his first
complete game all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the game, then let it get away toward the end,''
Snow said. ``We didn't play good defense behind Thomas.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor pitch well, either.
</P>
<P>
   DIRTBAGS NOTES: Dobbs and center fielder Terrmel Sledge were
selected to the all-tournament team. ... Catcher Bryan Kennedy
sustained a bruise to his right foot on Saturday and was held out
of the first game. ... The 19 hits allowed by the Dirtbags in the
second game were the second-most allowed in a game all season (they
gave up 20 in an 11-10 loss at Sacramento State on May 9. ... The
only time the 49ers lost by as many as 10 runs was April 4 at
Nevada, 18-8.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
Elaine Jones' pipeline to Nike has made her a force in Houston high
school basketball recruiting, but her maneuvers might have cost
Williowridge a shot at the state title.
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DANNY ROBBINS
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   A few days before the start of the school year last August, two
young men _ one 6-8, the other 6-7 _ were enrolled at Willowridge
High School by the same 50-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
   The young men, Ivan McFarlin and David Anderson, had come from
different backgrounds _ McFarlin having grown up in Houston,
Anderson in Puerto Rico _ and were connected only by the fact they
had played basketball during the summer on a team organized by the
woman who was enrolling them, Elaine Jones.
</P>
<P>
   They were able to enroll at Willowridge because Jones had been
granted power of attorney for that purpose and had represented that
the two young men would be living with her at a residence in the
Chasewood section of Missouri City.
</P>
<P>
   While some might have considered such an arrangement unusual,
perhaps even suspicious, Willowridge personnel barely gave it a
second thought. McFarlin and Anderson were placed in the 11th grade
and slated for spots on the school's basketball team, regarded as
one of the strongest in the state. No alarms went off.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months later, in the wake of an embarrassing eligibility
snafu and a ruined season, some in the Fort Bend Independent School
District are still trying to understand why.
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Getting involved with Jones meant Willowridge was dealing with
the director of the Houston Jaguars, a Nike-sponsored summer
basketball team for elite high school players.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting much of what she represented as fact on official
documents meant Willowridge was setting itself up for a fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we jumped off a cliff with this thing,'' said Keith
Kilgore, the Fort Bend ISD athletic director. ``I don't think we've
dealt internally with anything like this before.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilgore and others have been trying to sort out the details of
Jones' relationship with Willowridge since the February decision
that rendered McFarlin ineligible and caused the Eagles, then the
Chronicle's top-ranked Class 5A team, to forfeit 28 victories.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling occurred after Fort Bend ISD administrators became
aware Jones had represented herself as McFarlin's legal guardian
without having obtained such standing in court.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-8 forward, McFarlin returned to the Fort Bend ISD last fall
after spending his first two high school seasons at Girls and Boys
Prep Academy, a Houston charter school, where he had emerged as one
of the top players in the state. McFarlin's mother and stepfather,
Delphine and Jerry Jordan, live near Willowridge, but their
neighborhood is in the Dulles attendance zone.
</P>
<P>
   Because Jones was not McFarlin's legal guardian, the player was
in violation of the University Interscholastic League rule stating
that a student enrolled by an individual other than his or her
parents is not immediately eligible for UIL competition unless the
individual has been the student's court-appointed legal guardian
for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the implications for McFarlin and the Willowridge
basketball team, which failed to gain a berth in the playoffs, the
imbroglio has raised lingering questions about the judgment of
those at Willowridge who knew of Jones' link to McFarlin and
Anderson and never saw it as a potential problem.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly troubling for some Fort Bend ISD officials was the
fact they were never informed of McFarlin's relationship with Jones
even after they had asked Willowridge administrators during the
fall semester to check information indicating Anderson was living
at a home Jones owns in the Sweetwater section of Sugar Land, which
is part of the Clements attendance zone.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Puerto Rico, the 6-7 Anderson came to
Willowridge after spending the 1997-98 school year in Stratford,
Conn., where he lived with his stepbrother.
</P>
<P>
   After the issue of Anderson's residency was raised, the player
was withheld from varsity competition at Willowridge. He withdrew
from school at the semester break and later enrolled at Hargrave
Military Academy in Chatham, Va.
</P>
<P>
   According to Arthur R. Culver, a former Fort Bend ISD area
superintendent who had oversight of Willowridge last fall, the
Anderson matter should have prompted Willowridge personnel to
disclose McFarlin's relationship with Jones to school district
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what really upset me about the whole thing,'' he said
recently. ``They never told me Elaine enrolled both of them,
because, to me, if somebody comes in with two 6-8 players and
neither one is her true son, that should be (cause for) immediate
suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   Culver, now superintendent of schools in Longview, said there
was another occasion last fall when he asked Willowridge principal
Charles R. Polk and the school's boys basketball coach, Ronnie
Courtney, specifically how McFarlin had been enrolled. He said they
responded by saying McFarlin lived with his parents in the
Willowridge attendance zone.
</P>
<P>
   When the facts relating to McFarlin's enrollment came to light
months later, Culver said, he was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be frank with you, sir, I just felt like I was flat-out
lied to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Polk, Willowridge's principal since January 1996, said he might
have spoken to Culver about McFarlin last fall but did not give the
district administrator reason to believe McFarlin was living in the
Willowridge attendance zone with his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not lie and I did not cover up,'' he said. ``That's
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Courtney did not respond to interview requests for this story. &QL; 
 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Willowridge's alliance with Jones was a product of basketball's
so-called ``shoe war,'' the heated competition between shoe
companies _ primarily Nike and Adidas _ to gain marketing points in
the sport.
</P>
<P>
   The competition starts at the youth level, particularly the
summer tournaments and camps for rising high school stars.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA rules make it necessary for college coaches to evaluate
prospects mainly during a three-week window in July. As a result,
the month is a whirlwind of tournaments and camps designed as
showcases for high school talent.
</P>
<P>
   Motivated by the hunt for the next Michael Jordan, Nike and
Adidas sponsor virtually every summer team, camp and tournament and
compete aggressively to lock up the top players.
</P>
<P>
   Because the summer recruiting period heightens the influence of
those who coach and organize summer teams _ individuals who do not
answer to the rules of the NCAA or state high school athletic
associations and whose motives might be questionable _ many high
school and college coaches would like to see it modified or
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summer leagues, the AAU and all that stuff _ that's what's
got everything all screwed up,'' said Paul Graham, who recently
became head coach at Washington State after six years as an
assistant at Oklahoma State, ``because now you're dealing with
people who are trying to get something out of the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Clark Francis, who covers college basketball
recruiting extensively through his ``Hoop Scoop'' Web site and
column, some summer basketball operatives are looking for a
windfall while others are truly interested in helping young players
better themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big business,'' he said. ``A great player can wind
up in the NBA, get big bucks from Nike. There are a lot of things
that can potentially happen out of it (gaining a position of
influence with a player). Now if this were everyday America
business, would this be wrong? No. But everybody gets huffy because
you're dealing with kids who are 15, 16, 17, 18 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these people, their motives are for the right reasons.
They're doing great things for the kids. In other cases, the kids
are getting exploited.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis said summer operatives often direct players to certain
high schools, the idea being to help a school and eventually get
players from that school in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put a kid in High School A instead of High School B,
you're more likely to get all the players in that (High School A's)
program to play for your AAU team,'' he said. ``I give you a
player, you're going to give me players back.''
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Jones' team, the Houston Jaguars, is one of about 40 of its kind
sponsored by Nike as part of the its ``grass-roots'' program,
described in company literature as an effort to increase
opportunities for players and help ease funding burdens for teams
and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the Jaguars won the Nike Peach Jam Invitational, a
tournament in Augusta, Ga., and one of the most prestigious events
on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' roster at the Georgia event included McFarlin and
Anderson as well as Antonio Fal, the former Waltrip guard who has
signed with the University of Houston; Quinton Ross, a 6-6 swingman
from Dallas Kimball who has signed with SMU; and Taliek Brown, a
point guard from New York City who will be a senior next season and
is expected to be one of the most sought-after players in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Jones declined to be interviewed at length by the Chronicle or
answer questions relating to her efforts to enroll McFarlin and
Anderson at Willowridge.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of brief phone conversations, she described how she
organized her summer basketball program eight years ago mainly
because of her nephew, Trey Austin, who was then moving through the
youth basketball ranks and has since gone on to play at Westbury
Christian School and the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Calling herself a ``church-going, God-fearing person,'' Jones
said she believes her organization is as much about those values as
it is basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a gift that comes from God to minister his word to my
players,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other than her connection to Austin, there is little in Jones'
background to suggest a basketball CEO.
</P>
<P>
   In documents filed in November 1996 as part of a Chapter 13
bankruptcy proceeding she initiated three years earlier, she
described herself as divorced and unemployed. She listed her
monthly income as $3,500 from an annuity in the name of Melody
Roberts, her stepsister.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, 26, was severely burned in a house fire in Diboll in
1984 and filed suit in federal court in Beaumont against Carrier
Corp., the manufacturer of the furnace in the home at the time of
the blaze. The parties settled the suit in November 1985. Records
relating to the settlement were sealed by the court.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Jones became Roberts' legal guardian, according to
Harris County Probate Court records.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' bankruptcy papers show she previously owned and operated
a business that sold computer supplies in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' creditors included nine companies seeking payment for
outstanding debts relating to her computer-supply firm. Another
creditor was the Internal Revenue Service, which contended she had
failed to file income tax returns for the years 1987, 1988, 1989,
1990, 1991 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Stoyer, a Nike spokesman, said his company has had a
six-year relationship with Jones and supplies her team with free
shoes and equipment. Citing company policy, he declined to disclose
other aspects of the sponsorship arrangement, including the amount
Nike provides Jones for travel and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   He said Nike is aware of Jones' involvement in the McFarlin
eligibility case and believes she made an ``honest mistake'' based
on the assumption the power of attorney she obtained to enroll the
player at Willowridge would also allow him to be eligible under UIL
rules.
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Although McFarlin had attended a charter school for two years,
he came to Willowridge with a growing basketball reputation.
Entering last season, he was ranked No. 8 on the list of the
state's top 50 juniors compiled by Texas Hoops newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Kunstadt, editor of Texas Hoops, remembers watching
McFarlin play at Girls and Boys Prep as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the only player they had,'' he said. ``They (the team)
got killed, but he had 30, 40 points.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was a different story, a player whose skills were just
developing and one who had yet to become known to recruiting
analysts or college coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Puerto Rico, he spent the 1997-98 school year
in Stratford, Conn., where he lived with his stepbrother, a New
York City police officer, and was a reserve on a senior-dominated
Stratford High School team that lost only four games.
</P>
<P>
   Stratford coach Paul Dudzinski said he envisioned Anderson as a
starter in 1998-99 as well as a potential college prospect and was
shocked to learn in the middle of last summer that the player would
be leaving.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dudzinski, Anderson said he would be attending a
high school in Texas but seemed unsure which school it would be.
</P>
<P>
   Dudzinski said he initially thought the school would be Waltrip
because Anderson and Fal grew up in the same area of Puerto Rico
and knew each other there. Fal came to Houston from Puerto Rico in
1997 and played that summer for Jones' team before enrolling at
Waltrip.
</P>
<P>
   Dudzinski said Anderson also indicated Jones would become his
legal guardian.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were amazed at the whole thing,'' he said. ``I mean, where
are the parents?''
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Fort Bend ISD registration forms for McFarlin and Anderson show
the players were enrolled at Willowridge by Jones last August and
that their parents had granted her power of attorney to do so.
</P>
<P>
   According to Fort Bend ISD policy, a student can be enrolled at
a school by an individual other than his or her parents if the
individual resides in the school's attendance zone and has obtained
power of attorney from the student's parents.
</P>
<P>
   The registration forms for McFarlin and Anderson, obtained by
the Chronicle from Fort Bend ISD under the Texas Open Records Act,
listed the same home address for both players, a residence in the
Chasewood section of Missouri City.
</P>
<P>
   The residence, located within the Willowridge attendance zone,
is one of two homes owned by Jones in Fort Bend County, according
to county records. Jones' other home is in Sweetwater, part of the
Clements attendance zone. County records show the taxable value of
the Chasewood home is $76,120 and that of the Sweetwater home is
$481,660.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 28, 1998, six months before McFarlin and Anderson were
enrolled at Willowridge using the Chasewood address, Jones filed a
notice in her bankruptcy case stating her home address had changed
to that of the Sweetwater residence.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also notified the Texas Secretary of State's office of the
change of address in a January 1998 document relating to her
organization's status as a nonprofit corporation.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bill Malinowski, Fort Bend ISD director of
administrative services, an individual using power of attorney to
enroll a student at a school in the district must reside at the
home address listed as that of the student on the student's
registration form. Signing a registration form with one address
while residing at another would be falsifying a government
document, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to enrolling McFarlin and Anderson, Jones signed UIL
Previous Athletic Participation forms for the players as their
parent or legal guardian.
</P>
<P>
   The UIL uses such forms to ensure that high school athletes
transferring to new schools are moving for reasons unrelated to
athletics.
</P>
<P>
   A check of district- and probate-court records in Fort Bend and
Harris counties by the Chronicle found no evidence of Jones having
taken the steps necessary to assume legal guardianship of either
player.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Jones placed McFarlin and Anderson at
Willowridge, the school received a sponsorship package from Nike
that included free shoes, apparel and other gear worth thousands of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Outlined in a Sept. 4 letter from Lynn Merritt, Nike's director
of high school programs, to Courtney, the Willowridge coach, the
sponsorship package included 30 pairs of shoes, 30 pairs of socks,
four pairs of coaches' shoes, 25 T-shirts, six coaches' polo
shirts, 20 travel bags, 24 hats and 15 warm-up suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again this year it is our goal to provide our elite
programs with the very best that Nike has to offer in the way of
performance footwear and apparel,'' Merritt wrote in the letter,
provided to the Chronicle by Fort Bend ISD in response to a request
for public information regarding Willowridge's relationship with
Nike.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fort Bend ISD policy requires schools to report all
donations to the district's Board of Trustees, there is no record
of Willowridge having reported the Nike merchandise to the board. &QL; 
 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Polk, the Willowridge principal, said he approved Jones' plans
to enroll McFarlin and Anderson after speaking to her as well as
McFarlin's mother, Delphine Jordan. He said he gave his approval
because he found that Jones had legitimate reasons, which he
declined to identify.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he said, he had no knowledge of Jones' relationship
with Nike or her involvement with summer basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it would have been prudent to question why the same
woman had obtained power of attorney for two students, one 6-8 and
the other 6-7, Polk responded:
</P>
<P>
   ``Your knowledge of Mrs. Jones is completely different from my
knowledge of Mrs. Jones. I did not know Mrs. Jones to be this
representative or that representative. I assumed her intent was the
best interests of these young men, and I proceeded accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Polk also said he was not aware McFarlin was a basketball
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm out of touch,'' he said. ``I did not know Ivan
McFarlin, did not know anything of his basketball skills before he
enrolled at Willowridge. It wasn't the focus of the
conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   Polk said he did not challenge Jones' assertion she was the
legal guardian for McFarlin and Anderson because at the time he
believed the power of attorney required for enrollment by Fort Bend
ISD was sufficient for UIL eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas public-school teacher and administrator since 1968, Polk
became Willowridge principal in January 1996 after 15 years as a
principal and assistant principal in Baytown. His son, Eric Polk,
was a star running back at Baytown Sterling and attends Sam Houston
State University on a football scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney was hired as Willowridge basketball coach in 1997 after
eight years as coach at Davis High School in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kilgore, the Fort Bend ISD athletic director, the
first he learned of Jones' involvement at Willowridge was a call he
received in October indicating Anderson was living at Jones' home
in Sweetwater. Kilgore declined to identify the caller.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the call, Kilgore said, he asked Culver, then
the area superintendent with oversight for Willowridge, to check
out the caller's information.
</P>
<P>
   Kilgore said the matter caused Anderson to withdraw from school
at the semester break but did not prompt Polk or others at
Willowridge to inform the district that McFarlin also was connected
to Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, he said, the district had no reason to make
further inquiries regarding Jones' involvement at Willowridge and
did not do so until receiving a request for public information
regarding McFarlin and other basketball players at Fort Bend ISD
schools in January. The request was made by Matt Jackson, a UH
student researching a story for the school newspaper, the Daily
Cougar.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was told he (Anderson) was no longer participating, I
didn't delve into it anymore,'' Kilgore said. ``I wish I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Culver, who became superintendent in Longview in March, said he
first noticed McFarlin and Anderson when he visited the Willowridge
campus early in the fall semester and wandered into the gym during
an athletic period.
</P>
<P>
   When he asked Polk and Courtney about the two new players, he
said, he was told McFarlin lived with his parents in the
Willowridge attendance zone and Anderson lived with Jones in a home
she owned in the Willowridge zone.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, he said, he asked again about Anderson as a
result of Kilgore's request for information regarding the player's
residency.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Polk and Courtney) said, `Well, she (Jones) owns a home
in the Willowridge area,''' he said. ``I said, `Well, that's not
legal. It's not where she owns a home. He (Anderson) has to go to
school where she resides.'''
</P>
<P>
   Culver said he did not raise the subject of McFarlin at that
point because, based on his previous conversation with Polk and
Courtney regarding the player, he had no reason to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason they didn't tell me (the truth about
McFarlin) is because they knew how I would respond,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Polk acknowledged that McFarlin's connection to Jones was not
part of the discussion when the district sought information
regarding Anderson's residency but said there was no intent by
anyone at Willowridge to deceive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those (McFarlin and Anderson) were two different cases,'' he
said. ``Ivan McFarlin was in fact residing there (at the Chasewood
residence). Keith Kilgore had been alerted by somebody _ at
Clements, I think _ that Anderson was living near the Sweetwater
Country Club, but there was no reason to relate that to Ivan
McFarlin.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Culver's contention he was misled, Polk said he might
have discussed McFarlin with the administrator one afternoon last
fall in the Willowridge gym but did not say anything to make him
believe the player was living in the school's attendance zone with
his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the controversy is the fact McFarlin's enrollment at
Willowridge for most of the spring semester has been based on a
power of attorney granted to Ben Caldwell, a Missouri City resident
whose son, Chris Caldwell, was Willowridge's leading scorer as a
senior in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   The document, provided to the Chronicle by Fort Bend ISD, was
signed by Delphine Jordan on Jan. 26 _ six days after Fort Bend ISD
officials received the public-records request that caused scrutiny
of McFarlin's link to Jones and eight days before the player was
declared ineligible as a result of the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   McFarlin will be able to play for the Eagles as a senior next
season if he completes the school year at Willowridge and
legitimately lives at the Caldwell residence. He will not be
subject to the UIL rule requiring a court-appointed legal guardian
for eligibility because he will have been enrolled at Willowridge a
full year.
</P>
<P>
   Of McFarlin's present arrangement, Culver said: ``To me, it's
obvious you're playing games. Who does this guy really live with?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, where Willowridge High School basketball is concerned,
the question is one that apparently can't be asked enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm biased,'' Kilgore said recently, weariness in his voice.
``I want to think a lot of the things that have happened were due
to ignorance. At the same time, if people are knowingly breaking
rules, there should be consequences.''

   Two people were killed and seven injured Sunday in two separate
small-plane crashes in New York and New Jersey. On Saturday, a
small passenger plane went down in New Jersey, killing two people.
</P>
<P>
   The first crash Sunday occurred in Montgomery, N.Y., about 50
miles north of New York City, at 3:45 p.m. The plane went down in a
field next to West Searsville Road in rural Orange County, said
Trooper Michael Wzintek of the New York State Police. The pilot and
the passenger were killed, Wzintek said. He did not identify them,
but said they were from New Jersey. Wzintek said he did not know
the type of plane that crashed or its destination.
</P>
<P>
   The second crash Sunday occurred in Piscataway, N.J., at 5:43
p.m., said Sgt. George Maurer of the Piscataway Police Department.
A single-engine Cessna 206 passenger plane crashed into a tree,
then fell into a house at Day and Vera Avenues, Maurer said. The
plane caught fire, and the pilot and four passengers were pulled
from the flames by neighbors and rescue workers.
</P>
<P>
   Two people on the plane were seriously burned and were flown by
helicopter to the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New
Brunswick and then to Saint Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx. They
were in critical condition, said a spokeswoman for Robert Wood
Johnson. The three other people on the plane were in stable
condition at Robert Wood Johnson. Two people on the ground suffered
minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Maurer said that the plane had been based at Morristown Airport
and appeared to be headed there.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday afternoon, a plane went down in Hillsborough, N.J.,
killing two people. A 1969 single-engine piper that had taken off
from Central Jersey Airport crashed at the edge of the Roycebrook
Golf Course, about 3,500 feet from the runway's end, the
Hillsborough Township Police Department said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, John Jackson, 51, of Staten Island, was killed
immediately, as was the sole passenger, John E. Coleman Jr., 53, of
Laurelton, Queens, the police said. The plane was rented.

ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER TOXIN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  YOU CAN LEARN so much from reading your newspaper (he says,
hopefully).
<P>
   In a recent story in this very paper, I learned a new word and a
new phrase that I'm sure everyone will find useful.
</P>
<P>
   The thousands of portable classrooms in California are made with
woodlike products, plastics and synthetics. The story says that
these materials outgas.
</P>
<P>
   Outgas, verb. These building materials and objects radiate or
give off airborne carcinogenic chemicals like benzene and
formaldehyde. By the end of the school day, some kids are
practically embalmed. You might say these children ingas.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if their bodies are able in some ways to partially detox
once they leave school, then every school day they regas.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, fortunately, is easy. Children in portable
classrooms should not inhale. But kids will be kids, as will
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Ingas is a handy word that should be expanded beyond this narrow
meaning, not that it's not wonderful in this narrow use, where it
helps bad news go down easier.
</P>
<P>
   You'd feel terrible sending your children to school in
classrooms where the furniture and linoleum were ``poisoning''
them. Or where the classroom was ``passing gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Outgassing could easily be expanded to use in politics. We've
all been struggling to describe the skill perfected by President
Clinton, where he seems to be saying something, but it turns out he
didn't really mean what we thought he said.
</P>
<P>
   And now we learn that Republican front-runner George W. Bush has
the same gift. Some observers call this Bushspeak, but that's not
fair because Junior  &LR; Bush didn't invent it, though he's good. Bush,
asked to define his position on the war in Bosnia, said, ``I
support winning.'' He didn't say by whom.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals' scrappy team of the '30s was known as
the Gashouse Gang, and an excellent name for one of those TV shows
where the experts argue politics would be The Outgas Gang.
</P>
<P>
   We can all get involved. For starters, it's time we retired the
crude term ``BSer.'' If someone is giving you information or
opinion you know to be wrong or exaggerated, and you know that they
know it's wrong or exaggerated, you can simply call outgas.
</P>
<P>
   Or the term can be used in milder contexts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What were you and your friends talking about in the corner,
honey?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we were just outgassing.''
</P>
<P>
   The news story on classrooms said that the outgassed organic
toxins in some cases are 15 times the level considered ``the
comfort zone.'' Yes, science has a comfort zone for human snorting
of formaldehyde.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you children comfortable with the number of micrograms of
formaldehyde per cubic meter of air in here, or should we all put
on our gas masks? Children? Children?''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the paper recently, the story of a woman who went to a
fertility clinic, had several of her fertilized eggs implanted and
gave birth to fraternal twins. One was the biological combo of her
and her husband, the other was the combo of a couple whose egg got
mixed with the first couple's batch. Oops!
</P>
<P>
   The author of the newspaper story, uncredited, called this
situation ``the embryo imbroglio.''
</P>
<P>
   Poetry. There is much fine literature hidden in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Take a recent wire-service story about 49ers backup quarterback
Jim Druckenmiller. He is accused of raping a woman who was drunk.
We pick up the story with the defense attorney named Caldwell-Bono
speaking to the judge, referring to the alleged victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to her statement at the hospital, she does not
remember anything after getting into the car,'' Caldwell-Bono told
Judge Ray Grubbs. ``She remembers waking up, and he was on top of
her. She did not tell him to stop. She let him finish. She did not
say help, and when they finished, she started to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Matters notes, ``That paragraph is the best bad Hemingway
I've seen in The Chronicle in years.''
</P>
<P>
   Really, your newspaper is just bad news in a funny package.
People send me police-log items from small-town newspapers, and
they can be darn cute. But consider this from the Half Moon Bay
Review, submitted by Anne Weinberger:
</P>
<P>
   ``An incident of `gopher taunting' that resulted in the death of
one of the furry tunnel diggers at HMB High School has been
referred to the District Attorney's office for review.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students in PE class were teasing a gopher that kept
popping out of a hole in the field. A teacher warned them to be
nice to the animal, but one student kicked the gopher five feet
into the air, and another student kicked it, and the gopher wound
up dead.
</P>
<P>
   Hate crime? You be the judge. But there's a possibility these
kids were just overgassed.
</P>
<P>
   In coal mines, canaries in cages are more sensitive to dangerous
and odorless gases than are humans, so their death is a warning
signal (especially to other canaries).
</P>
<P>
   If a gopher is taunted and kicked to death on a school
playground, it could be a warning signal that toxic chemicals in
the classroom may be outgassing the comfort zone.

   STANFORD STUDY TO CONSIDER THE MATTER OF THE UNIVERSEBy DAVID 
 PERLMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ An international team of scientists has
launched a pioneering experiment at Stanford aimed at explaining
how all the matter in the universe came to exist _ from the stars
and galaxies in the heavens to the microbes and humans on Earth.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Inside a huge underground machine, the team has begun firing
beams of subnuclear particles at each other, creating tiny
fireballs of new particles that could reveal the answers the
scientists are seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal is ambitious, indeed: to understand in unprecedented
detail why the universe contains so much more real matter than the
stuff called antimatter _ and whether science's current views of
nature's fundamental forces and particles need changing.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen years after it was conceived, the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center's $287 million Asymmetric B Factory is
finally in operation. About 650 scientists and engineers from 10
nations designed and built the massive facility, and scores of them
are operating it day and night on this holiday weekend in a final
tune-up before turning it up to full power.
</P>
<P>
   The project is a joint venture between SLAC and the Lawrence
Berkeley and Livermore National Laboratories, with contributions
from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the beginning of a great adventure,'' said Nobel laureate
Burton Richter, the retiring director of SLAC, who has watched the
facility being built and teased into operation for the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're exploring tiny regions of space where titanic events
take place. And with the help of the Department of Energy and the
steady support of funds from Congress, we've begun operations
exactly on schedule and even under budget.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``titanic events'' that the new machine creates are the
result of thousands of collisions between bunches of high-energy
electrons and their identical but oppositely charged particles
called positrons _ pairs of invisible matter and antimatter
objects.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the explosive collisions should soon be creating
millions of rare, fast-vanishing particles called B mesons. These
are prime examples of matter and antimatter that can be analyzed
precisely to understand how they are at once the same and yet so
vastly different.
</P>
<P>
   Those fleeting pairs of B mesons decay with almost inconceivable
swiftness _ within a trillionth of a second _ and as they fly
through less than a ten-thousandth of an inch of space within the
vacuum of the B Factory, the machine's 1,200-ton detector can
separate the antimatter B mesons from the more prosaic Bs to yield
arcane information on their different decay modes.
</P>
<P>
   The B Factory's twin beams of opposing electrons and positrons
were conceived in 1986 by Pier Oddone, a Peru-born physicist at the
University of California's Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Oddone
reasoned that if the electrons could be shot out of the machine at
three times more energy than the positrons, the B mesons resulting
from the explosion should fly into the detector at different
velocities so scientists could analyze them separately. It was an
inspiration that made the entire project possible.
</P>
<P>
   As Oddone calculated, the anti-Bs would decay much faster than
the normal Bs, and as he saw the first computer-generated images of
the collisions inside the machine's detector this weekend, he was
elated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pictures look terrific,'' he said. ``They're like baby
pictures, and within a few days they should show us the first
evidence that we're really producing Bs.''
</P>
<P>
   Physicists designate the antiparticles of a B meson as the
letter B with a bar on top, so the huge particle detector in the B
Factory is nicknamed BaBar, a moniker  &LR; inspired by the French
stories of Babar, the quixotic and impulsive young elephant.
</P>
<P>
   BaBar's effort has a long history that began when the  &LR; French
physicist Paul Dirac predicted the existence of antimatter in 1929,
and the world's physicists later accepted the model of the Big Bang
to explain the birth of the universe. But since, they have puzzled
over one of the great mysteries of cosmic evolution:
</P>
<P>
   Within trillionths of a second after the Big Bang, they have
reasoned, the primordial explosion _ many billions of degrees hot _
must have created a universe that contained equal quantities of
matter and antimatter. But the physicists have also observed that
whenever particles of matter and antimatter encounter each other,
they annihilate themselves instantly in flashes of pure energy.
</P>
<P>
   So somehow, as the universe began creating stars and galaxies
and clusters of galaxies _ and ultimately planets and people _ most
of the antimatter must have vanished in what is now known as the
cosmic microwave background radiation. And matter, the stuff of
everything, has dominated antimatter everywhere ever since.
</P>
<P>
   At the instant of the Big Bang, physicists theorize, nearly all
the matter and antimatter particles annihilated themselves;
although within a fraction of a second, one out of every billion
original particles remained as pure matter _ enough to build
today's universe.
</P>
<P>
   As Richter put it: ``If matter hadn't come to dominate over
antimatter, our universe today would be nothing but a huge expanse
of pure radiation, with nothing else in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The B Factory's explosions of electrons and positrons, then, are
designed to produce huge quantities of the B mesons and anti-Bs so
that physicists can determine precisely how fast they decay and
what their decay products are _ the varied fundamental quarks and
the cascades of other particles that also vanish fleetingly.
</P>
<P>
   In the two basic beams of the B Factory, the electrons race
around their separate ring at energies of 9 billion volts, while
the positrons, their antimatter counterparts, speed in a separate
ring at an ``asymmetric'' energy of 3.1 billion volts. And this
asymmetry is what causes the pairs of B mesons to fly forward
separately toward the huge target where their exotic properties and
decay times can be measured.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial detector, where David Hitlin of Caltech presides, is
actually a massive and complex onion-shaped array of six separate
detectors that include a layer of pure silicon; a drift chamber
holding 27,000 wires strung through gas; a series of 192 quartz
bars; another layer of 8,500 cesium iodide crystals imported from
Russia, England, France and China; a large superconducting
solenoid, and a final ring of 19 iron plates.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese physicists have finished building their own B factory
at Tsukuba near Tokyo _ an equally huge and costly machine called
KEK. Sunday Jonathan Dorfan, the B Factory leader who takes over as
the director of SLAC in August, flew to Japan with Richter for a
conference with their Japanese colleagues. The two teams of
physicists have been sharing data all along, but competition is
keen to deliver the first results.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a neck-and-neck race,'' Dorfan said. ``We'd love to be
the first to report that we've produced Bs, but then we have to do
physics with them. And it's not the kind of physics you do in a few
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it could be a year or more before either team of
physicists reports the first findings from their B factories _ and
at least 10 years more of research before they can answer all the
questions that they have asked about the ``Standard Model'' of the
universe as they now perceive it.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists who provide the first valid answers, however, are
almost certain to win a Nobel Prize in physics, for the answers
that emerge from the B factories are so profound that they could
alter much of science as it stands today.

 Includes a color slide of Cuba Gooding Jr. with Anthony Hopkins in
a scene from ``Instinct.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Don't show him the money.
 &HT;    Just show him to a quiet table, a quiet back room, even a quiet
back door so Cuba Gooding Jr. can get away from the people who want
to hear The Line.
 &HT;    ``Say it,'' begs a teen-age boy in baggy jeans. ``You must say
it, man!''
 &HT;    ``Please say it,'' says a young woman on Michigan Avenue in
downtown Chicago. ``My friend over there is sick, and she would
feel better if you said it just once.''
 &HT;    Even at a local hamburger joint, the request swells to a general
chorus that even a determinedly low-profile Gooding can't ignore.
 &HT;    And give him this much, when the actor does anything, it's in a
big way.
 &HT;    Suddenly, he catapults up from a booth, his hips swiveling and
his head grooving to some imaginary beat.
 &HT;    ``Shoooow me the moonnn-aaaaay!'' he shrieks, and his fans burst
into applause,
 &HT;    Sure, a few older patrons look at him and clearly write him off
as another young guy who's obviously snapped. But everyone else
knows beyond a doubt that Cuba Gooding Jr. is in town.
 &HT;    Actually, Gooding says later as he relaxes in a luxury suite at
Chicago's Four Seasons Hotel, that was his character in ``Jerry
Maguire'' (1996). The actor himself doesn't need to be shown the
money.
 &HT;    ``I actually drive my agents crazy,'' he says, ``because they'll
want to negotiate a bigger salary for me on projects that I really
want to do. But if I get any resistance from the studio, I just
immediately go, `OK, fine. I'll take whatever they're offering me.'
 &HT;    ``The studios are willing to pay me big bucks to do an action
movie,'' Gooding adds, ``but I turn those down all the time. I
don't want the people who follow my movies to leave the theater
going, `He did that one for the cash!'''
 &HT;    So you know that it wasn't for the money that he signed on to
film ``Instinct,'' opening nationwide on June 4. Based on Daniel
Quinn's book ``Ishmael,'' the film casts him as a psychiatrist
assigned to evaluate a famous primatologist (Anthony Hopkins)
accused of ``going native,'' living among the gorillas he studies
and ultimately murdering two park rangers.
 &HT;    The money didn't enter into it, Gooding says. More important was
the chance to work with the Oscar-winning Hopkins ... and to redeem
himself in the British actor's eyes.
 &HT;    Wincing, he recalls their first meeting, at a 1997 industry
showcase.
 &HT;    ``It was so embarrassing,'' Gooding says, shaking his head.
``All I saw was the back of this bald head. Someone says to me,
`That's Tony Hopkins.' And I said, `Oh, no it's not. It's Lester
from the `Addams Family.'''
 &HT;    At which point, the man turned and gave him all the frost that
you'd expect from the eye of Sir Anthony Hopkins.
 &HT;    ``I gasped and said, `Oh, hello, Mr. Hopkins, nice to meet
you,''' Gooding adds. ``He wasn't mad for a moment, so I
impulsively wrapped my arms around him and gave him a big hug. Tony
then whispered to me, `So, kid, you're going to do that movie,
aren't you? The movie with the apes?'
 &HT;    ``I had no clue what he was talking about at the time.''
 &HT;    At that moment, the script for ``Instinct'' was lying amid a
pile that had flooded into his office since he had won a Best
Supporting Actor Oscar as football player Rod Tidwell in ``Jerry
Maguire.''
 &HT;    ``The Oscar was like this sonic boom,'' Gooding says. ``I went
from, `Oh, look, it's that guy from ``Boyz N the Hood''' to `Hey,
Cuba my man!'''
 &HT;    Since collecting his statuette, Gooding has put Jack Nicholson
in his place as a gay art dealer in ``As Good As It Gets'' (1997)
and toured heaven and hell with Robin Williams in ``What Dreams May
Come'' (1998), almost certainly the only film in which he'll ever
play Williams' son. He was even able to raise enough cash to
produce his first feature, ``A Murder of Crows,'' a thriller
starring Eric Stoltz that's due for release later this year.
 &HT;    And he's having fun, which should come as no surprise to anyone
who saw his exuberant acceptance speech at the Oscars. No one could
call him inhibited.
 &HT;    ``Cuba has no fear,'' Williams said during a ``What Dreams''
interview. ``What I love about him the most is that at the drop of
a hat he'll drop his trousers.''
 &HT;    Actually, yes. Even when the script calls for nudity, though _
as it does in one of his upcoming films _ Gooding can manage to
surprise people.
 &HT;    ``I had to do this really passionate love scene,'' he recalls,
bounding to his feet to set the scene. ``So I said, `Can I get the
whole crew in here, please?' I was really serious. I adjusted my
robe and I said, `Listen, this is a very big day. I don't want any
laughing.'
 &HT;    ``Then I dropped the robe,'' he says, deadpan. ``My assistant
had made this prosthetic penis _ he stuffed a stocking with
cellophane. Well, the whole crew cracked. The tension evaporated.
Afterward it didn't matter how long we were naked that day, it just
didn't matter.''
 &HT;    Gooding was 23 when he dazzled audiences in ``Boyz N the Hood''
(1991). He expected a major career to ensue, but few offers
appeared, and most of them were highly derivative of ``Boyz.''
 &HT;    ``I was offered dozens of inner-city movies, but I passed,'' he
says. ``I also didn't want to play the villain or the good-bad guy
_ I always wanted to be a leading man.''
 &HT;    Roles in ``Lightning Jack'' (1994) and ``Outbreak'' (1995) led
to an audition for ``Jerry Maguire'' _ opposite Robin Williams, who
briefly considered the title role that later went to Tom Cruise.
 &HT;    A year later, Gooding was thanking the Academy and his wife, a
teacher named Sara. The Goodings live in Los Angeles with their
sons, 5-year-old Spencer and 2-year-old Mason. They also have three
Great Danes _ Pitch Black, Woodrow and Lollipop.
 &HT;    A self-described ``homebody,'' Gooding says he isn't one for the
Hollywood circuit of parties and premieres.
 &HT;    ``A big night is Pay-Per-View,'' he says.
 &HT;    The other night, he adds, he even caught ``Jerry Maguire'' on
cable.
 &HT;    ``I immediately got caught up in it,'' the actor says. ``But
then I had to turn it off, because I started thinking, `That's the
best you're ever going to be.' I had to stop looking at it.''
 &HT;    He sighs.
 &HT;    ``Winning the Oscar is tricky,'' he says. ``It starts you off on
having internal dialogues you never thought you'd have.''
 &HT;    And besides, it can make you crazy after a while.
 &HT;    ``The only bad part of winning the Oscar,'' he adds, ``was that
I went home that night and my nanny had Spencer waiting on the
driveway. The minute I stepped out of the limo, the nanny was like,
`OK, say it to Daddy.' Spencer yawns and says, `Show me da money,
daddy.'
 &HT;    ``I looked at my nanny like, `I'll kill you!''' Gooding says,
laughing. ``I'm standing in my driveway screaming, `No, no, no!'''

WHISTLING DIXIE: HOW THE DIXIE CHICKS RUFFLED NASHVILLE'S
FEATHERS

 Includes a color slide of Martie Seidel, Emily Erwin and Natalie
Maines, the Dixie Chicks. 
 By BOB PAXMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    They're three women who dress like alternative-rock stars but
play a mixture of straight country, pop and bluegrass. They go by a
slightly tongue-in-cheek name, the Dixie Chicks.
 &HT;    In a word, they're so un-Nashville, yet the Dixie Chicks find
themselves ruling the country roost, and the Nashville
establishment has been forced to pay attention to them, like it or
not.
 &HT;    The Dixie Chicks _ fiddle player Martie Seidel,
multi-instrumentalist Emily Erwin and lead vocalist Natalie Maines
_ burst practically unknown onto the country scene in January 1998.
In little more than a year they've managed to ruffle the feathers
of normally placid Music Row _ which isn't that hard, but the
Chicks have gotten away with it, which is much rarer.
 &HT;    Their escape hatch, of course, has been popularity, which
translates into one thing that even Nashville can't ignore: money.
 &HT;    Their debut album, ``Wide Open Spaces,'' recently reached the 5
million sales mark. Its first single, ``I Can Love You Better,''
soared into the top 10, and the followups, ``There's Your Trouble''
and the album's title cut, both hit No. 1 on the country charts.
Country Music Association Awards and two Grammy Awards were simply
icing on the cake.
 &HT;    All this from virtually nowhere, leaving the country world
scratching its head and asking, ``Who are these women, and how are
they doing this?''
 &HT;    The look and the sound are both part of it, Erwin says.
 &HT;    ``Three women doing what we do is just so different in itself,''
says the tallest of the trio, who plays banjo, guitar, dobro and
mandolin. ``The fact that we play our own instruments has a lot to
do with our signature sound. People probably look at us playing
fiddles and banjos or whatever and think, `What are they doing up
there?'
 &HT;    ``But it's fun for us, and I think we are breaking a lot of
stereotypes.''
 &HT;    They've also latched onto a particular audience, mainly women in
their 20s _ as all three Chicks happen to be _ looking for feisty
role models. ``I Can Love You Better'' and ``There's Your Trouble''
embody a certain edginess without giving way to the anger that
seems to drive some other female pop acts.
 &HT;    ``We are a little partial to songs like that,'' Erwin agrees.
``There's a psychology behind it, you know, `You're seeing the
wrong one, buddy!' But we're just calling it like it is. People
like things in plain English.''
 &HT;    She laughs.
 &HT;    ``It reminds me of a lot of Tammy Wynette's songs,'' she adds.
``She was always saying, `Girl, get your head out of your
you-know-what,' and I loved her for that reason.''
 &HT;    Once you establish yourself in that vein, of course, you get
pitched similar songs by everyone with an ax to grind. And, yes,
the Chicks are getting more than their share.
 &HT;    ``We're getting piles and piles of `attitude' songs,'' Erwin
reports, chuckling. ``Guess there's an awful lot of 'tude out
there.
 &HT;    ``But that's not our M.O. at all,'' she says. ``The song `Wide
Open Spaces' has a lot of depth to it. `Once You've Loved Somebody'
is a great ballad. So there's no formula for a Chicks song _ if we
like it and we think we can put our harmonies to it, that's all we
need.''
 &HT;    Incidentally, the Chicks aren't really from Dixie. All three are
Texas natives, actually. Seidel and Erwin are sisters who were
already veterans of the music business by the time they _ and two
since-departed partners, Laura Lynch and Robin Macy _ founded the
Chicks in 1989.
 &HT;    The sisters got their first experience in six years of touring
the country as members of Blue Night Express, a teen bluegrass
group. The Chicks were officially hatched in an informal way, when
the four _ Seidel then 19 and Erwin 16 _ took their instruments to
a Dallas street corner and started playing for tips.
 &HT;    It wasn't meant as the start of something big, Seidel recalls,
but something clicked.
 &HT;    ``We knew there was something magical _ or at least lucrative _
about women playing music together,'' she says. ``The only problem
was we didn't have a name.''
 &HT;    Finding one wasn't easy, as the performers struggled for a tag
that they'd all go for. One morning, though, the answer came out of
thin air _ literally, since it was on the radio that they happened
to hear the Little Feat song ``Dixie Chicken.''
 &HT;    One syllable-extraction later _ Seidel didn't like the idea of
being a chicken _ they had a name.
 &HT;    But though they found ample bookings at clubs and dance halls
around Texas, the Chicks couldn't get any record companies
interested. It took six more years for the missing ingredient to
arrive, in the form of Maines.
 &HT;    The daughter of producer/musician Lloyd Maines, she'd heard the
band several times during her days as a college student in Lubbock,
Texas. Liking their style, she sent the sisters a demo tape in 1995
_ as it happened, just when the search was on for a replacement
Chick.
 &HT;    Seidel and Erwin admired not only Maines' voice, but also the
somewhat brazen personality she brought to her singing. Blonde and
brassy with a lilting soprano, Maines brought a Marilyn Monroe
spark to the Chicks' country style.
 &HT;    ``Our music evolved to this point once Natalie came in,'' Seidel
says. ``It took finding Natalie to make us say, `We've got
something.' That was the best thing that ever happened to Emily and
me.''
 &HT;    The band, now a trio, clicked almost immediately. And in 1997,
when Sony Music Entertainment decided to relaunch Monument Records,
former home to Roy Orbison and other country-pop legends, the first
act it signed was the Dixie Chicks.
 &HT;    The rest is, if not history, at least yesterday's news. Leaving
the obvious question, is there anywhere to go but down?
 &HT;    Unsurprisingly, the Chicks think their ride is only beginning.
 &HT;    ``One of our biggest goals is to write more of our own
material,'' Erwin says. ``Not long ago we went on a songwriter's
retreat outside Nashville and worked with all these great writers.
It was important for us to learn more about the craft of writing,
because we are new songwriters in relation to a lot of other
people.''
 &HT;    If you're wondering what sort of tunes the Chicks would write on
their own behalf, you won't have to wait long to find out.
 &HT;    ``We already have a handful of songs that we'll be recording for
our next album,'' Erwin reports.
 &HT;    That album, as yet untitled, is scheduled for release Aug. 31.
And the country-music world, which was generally skeptical about
the Chicks' chances as recently as a year ago, is predicting great
things.
 &HT;    Apparently the Dixie Chicks _ name, look and all-girl status
intact _ aren't the marketing problem that they once seemed.
Country audiences have a wider range of interest than many
observers had predicted, and the Chicks aren't ``too different'' to
succeed.
 &HT;    ``We heard a lot of that,'' Erwin admits.
 &HT;    In the end, she says, the marketing strategy wound up to be a
simple one _ let the Chicks be what they are.
 &HT;    ``We are not something that's been manufactured,'' she explains.
``We're real, we play our own instruments, which is kind of bizarre
to a lot of people. Maybe we were considered different or odd or
something _ but, you know, people who take the greatest chances
often make the greatest gains.
 &HT;    ``We tried to reinvent the wheel a million times, before
realizing what the essence of Dixie Chicks really is,'' she
concludes. ``Now we are definitely going to do this on our own
terms.''

FEMINIST THEOLOGY EXPANDING WOMEN'S ROLES IN CHRISTIANITY
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes color photo a woman reaching out to Michelangelo's famous
painting of God)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Few people leave a church because the pastor is a woman, says
the Rev. Hollis Boardman, based on her nearly 20 years' experience.
</P>
<P>
   But they can certainly cause problems.
</P>
<P>
   Boardman recalls that earlier in her career as a United
Methodist minister, she received a visit one day from a couple in
her church.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said, 'We've decided we need a family man as our pastor,
and we want you replaced,''' said Boardman, who was appointed last
year as pastor of First United Methodist Church of Fort Meade, a
small, rural town in Central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The discontented couple went to the committee in charge of
pastoral appointments and were turned down, Boardman said, but they
responded by waging a smear campaign that, for a year or more, made
life difficult for her.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment Boardman encountered is hardly unique. Of the 10
largest Christian denominations in the country, only four
officially allow women to be ordained as ministers, according to
the Yearbook of American &AMP; Canadian Churches. In the Catholic
Church, the Vatican strengthened its position that women may not be
ordained as priests by declaring the teaching ''infallible'' in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant group,
has taken a similar position since passing a resolution in 1984
that ''the Scriptures teach that women are not in public worship to
assume a role of authority over men.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than 25 years since Mary Daly's ''Beyond God
the Father'' fired the opening shot in a war against what she and
others claimed is ''patriarchy'' in the Bible, and in church
doctrine and practice. Since men are the writers and interpreters
of scripture and doctrine, the argument goes, there is a bias in
the church against women having positions of authority, and, in
some cases, these documents are used to justify belittling or
oppressing women.
</P>
<P>
   Daly's book opened the floodgates to a type of theology that
specializes in rooting out this bias and offering an alternative.
Under feminist theology, women are not only equal as children of
God, but could also be preachers and bishops and makers of rules.
</P>
<P>
   Some Protestant denominations were ahead of feminism in placing
women in positions of authority. The United Methodist Church and a
branch of what is now the Presbyterian Church (USA) were the first
to ordain women as ministers, starting in 1956, preceding Betty
Friedan's ''The Feminine Mystique'' by several years.
</P>
<P>
   But since the early 1970s, feminist theology has moved far and
fast, questioning every major point of scripture and doctrine, even
the nature of God, and providing the intellectual ammunition for
one side of the continued debate over the role of women in the
church.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been about bringing women's experiences to bear on the
whole religious tradition, its symbols and practices, affirming
some and challenging others,'' said Elizabeth A. Johnson, professor
of theology at Fordham University in the Bronx, N.Y., and one of
the pioneers of feminist theology.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Johnson points to the way traditional theology has
identified pride as the cardinal sin. ''That's fine if you're a
male authority figure. Grace then comes as humility. But what if
you've been called all your life to be subservient? Then sin might
be being overdependent, not assuming responsibility for yourself
enough. Grace then comes as a call to affirm oneself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For the traditional church-going woman, ''feminist theology''
carries connotations of radicalism; of rejecting all male leaders,
from the pope to the president of the youth fellowship; of
rewriting the Bible and worshiping a goddess. Yet Cynthia Rigby,
assistant professor of theology at Austin (Texas) Theological
Seminary, said in a recent article in the independent magazine
''Presbyterian Outlook,'' that while some feminist theologians hold
those views, many other church women and men accept insights from
feminist theology without realizing it.
</P>
<P>
   For instance: that Jesus treated women with dignity uncommon for
his day, or that God is neither male nor female, and the Bible
occasionally attributes motherly or feminine qualities to Him.
</P>
<P>
   In the Old Testament, Isaiah writes in chapter 66, verse 13,
that the Lord says: ''As a mother comforts her child, so will I
comfort you.'' The parable of the woman searching for the coin in
Luke 15:8-10, represents God searching for a lost person to bring
him into His kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Feminist theology has liberated some biblical passages from
interpretations that are misogynist, says Sara Fletcher Harding,
assistant professor of religion at Florida Southern College in
Lakeland, Fla. An especially abused passage, she says, is the one
in Genesis in which Eve and Adam eat the forbidden fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Augustine called Eve a temptress. Others said women were to
blame for bringing sin into the world, and because of Eve, Christ
was crucified. Well, in Genesis, the text doesn't say she seduced
Adam, she hands him a piece of fruit, and he eats it. We're just
setting the record straight,'' Harding said.
</P>
<P>
   Some feminist theologians, like Daly, say the church is so
hopelessly corrupted with patriarchy, the only solution is to
create a separate, all-woman church that is free to develop its own
ideas and forms of worship, including for some, the worship of a
female deity.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Shaw Crouse, a Methodist laywoman and director of the
Ecumenical Coalition on Women and Society, a project of the
conservative Institute on Religion and Democracy in Washington,
D.C., attended a Reimagining conference in April 1998 and calls
what went on there ''apostasy and heresy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They believe feminism cannot be defended within the context of
scripture. By reinterpreting scripture, they redefine what the
Christian faith is all about,'' Crouse said. Crouse also accuses
the women's departments in mainline churches of being a conduit for
the more heretical ideas of feminist theology.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition Crouse heads, formed in 1994, represents a
backlash against feminist theology, mostly from evangelical and
''orthodox'' church leaders. The group has become more organized
and vocal, as evangelicals have gained confidence and political
clout.
</P>
<P>
   But just as feminist theology represents a variety of responses
to perceived male oppression, neither are its critics of one mind.
Crouse's coalition does not have a position on the ordination of
women, because, she says, the issue is too divisive. Crouse herself
favors allowing women to be ordained. Her mother, at age 64,
entered seminary and was later ordained and appointed as pastor to
the congregation her late husband had served.

TRYING ONE'S IMPATIENS: VERSATILE FLOWER A SHADY SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes color photo of bed of pink and orange impatiens) 
 By SUSAN MCCLURE 
 c.1999 Susan McClure 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Impatiens, a flowering garden plant which arrived on the garden
scene in the 1980s, has quickly replaced petunias as a favorite
bedding annual. What has proved most enticing about impatiens
plants is their love of shade.
</P>
<P>
   In dark or dappled areas under trees or on the north side of a
wall, in mature suburbs and in the shadows of skyscrapers,
impatiens thrive. All summer and into fall, they are covered with
flat-faced, bright flowers in shades of red, pink, purple, white,
and orange. The pastels look especially luminous in dark settings.
</P>
<P>
   Impatiens have even more of which to boast. Each small seedling
quickly grows into a graceful mound, making an attractive focus for
pots, clusters, and entire beds. The flowers, which need no
deadheading, fall off when done blooming.
</P>
<P>
   Bedding impatiens, and a number of other species and garden
plants, are named for their seed pods. When ripe, the pods snap
open flinging seeds across the ground. This character is
particularly pronounced in wild touch-me-nots, impatiens that grow
locally in moist, shady woodlands and can be harvested to use the
juicy sap to relieve the itching produced by poison ivy.
</P>
<P>
   While bedding impatiens are the best known, there are a number
of other impatiens flowers _ old-fashioned busy lizzies,
sun-tolerant New Guinea impatiens and exotic species from Africa
and elsewhere. Here is a preview of the many kinds of impatiens
that you might try in your garden. &QL; 
 &UR; Bedding Impatiens &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Developed from flowers native to Tanzania and Mozambique, these
are the impatiens that are sold everywhere in spring. Different
varieties come in mind-boggling numbers and grow from 8 to 24
inches high, usually reaching equally wide.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most compact is the popular Accent series with
luscious flowers in colors such as apricot, burgundy, carmine,
coral, cranberry, deep pink, lavender blue, lilac, orange, pink,
pink blush, red, rose, salmon, scarlet, violet, and white. Other
varieties in this series have a central white star or contrasting
white petal edge.
</P>
<P>
   Other compact impatiens include the Dazzler series, which has
the only coral-colored flowers available, and the Deco series with
striking dark green foliage. The Super Elfin series has
particularly large flowers and comes in a new color, ''Sunrise'',
with a salmon orange center and purple edges. The Swirl Series has
bicolor flowers _ light coral, rose, or salmon with dark edges.
</P>
<P>
   Growing slightly larger, 10 to 12 inches high, are Show Stopper
impatiens with big, 2-inch-wide flowers ideal for for hanging
baskets. This series includes Cherry Flair, a creamy white with
streaks of rose and Soft Blue, a pastel lavender blue.
</P>
<P>
   The Tempo series also includes large bloomers in many colors
including Watermelon, which is salmon pink with a cherry red eye.
</P>
<P>
   Of increasing popularity are double flowered or rosebud
impatiens, which look like the graceful buds of roses before the
flowers open. Some rosebud impatiens combine these attractive
flowers with white-edged foliage, making beautiful specimen plants
for a pot.
</P>
<P>
   You may find rosebud impatiens in the Carousel series,
Confection Series, and under the name Victorian Rose. &QL; 
 &UR; New Guinea Impatiens &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This even more recent newcomer to American gardens hails from
Southeast Asia and tolerates sun or light shade. Its flowers, which
reach 2 or 3 inches wide, surpass bedding impatiens in size.
</P>
<P>
   The plants also stretch up taller, easily reaching 2 feet high.
The elongated leaves may be found in ordinary green, and also in
bronze, white variegated, and even pink-splashed colors, making for
electric color combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Look for the Spectra series, which comes in colors such as
lilac-rose, pink velvet, and shades of red, salmon, and rose. Give
a sniff to the new Socialite series, which are unique for their
fragrance. Tango, with fluorescent orange flowers, is one of the
few to grow from seeds instead of cuttings.
 &UR; Busy Lizzies &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This flower, which hails from China and India, has an old-
fashioned look well-suited for cottage gardens, blending with
perennials, or mixing in other informal beds.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers stretch along the upper portions of the stem,
dangling out from under the lance-shaped leaves more demurely than
bedding or New Guinea impatiens. Lightly perfumed, they come in
pink, red, white, lavender, and yellow, with single or double
petals.
 &UR; Caring for Impatiens &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Impatiens, particularly sensitive to frost, should not go out
into the garden until after mid- to late May. Give bedding
impatiens light to full shade, and rich, moist garden soil. Busy
Lizzies and New Guinea impatiens will grow well in sun, as long as
the soil is kept moist.
</P>
<P>
   Fertilize once a month, or more often if growing impatiens under
a shallow rooted tree or in less-than-fertile soil. Water weekly
when there is less than an inch of rain.
</P>
<P>
   When growing impatiens in pots or hanging baskets, add a
water-holding gel to the potting soil before planting. Fertilize
weekly with a water-soluble product and water daily, if needed,
during hot weather.

SAFFRON BURROWS: THE DARK SIDE OF INNOCENCE

 Includes a color slide of Saffron Burrows with Stefano Dionisi,
Rodney Charles and Julian Sands in a scene from ``The Loss of
Sexual Innocence.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Any minute now Saffron Burrows may find herself a movie star,
but if she ends up famous it won't be her fault.
 &HT;    ``It's undeniable that receiving a compliment from someone you
admire _ a friend, journalist, politician _ is a wonderful
feeling,'' the British actress says. ``But there's a very large
difference between that and the mad, mad, mad world of celebrity.
 &HT;    ``I've gotten a small taste of it, but I've seen it really
happen to people I know, and it can be scary and disorienting,''
she says. ``It's nothing I want for myself.''
 &HT;    The 26-year-old Burrows first generated buzz as the chic,
popular one of the three Irish friends in the surprise hit ``Circle
of Friends'' (1995). More recently she's juggled projects both
mainstream and offbeat, starring in the misbegotten big-screen
version of ``Wing Commander'' (1999) and in three upcoming films _
two of them the independent features ``The Loss of Sexual
Innocence'' and ``Miss Julie,'' the third a big-budget thriller,
``Deep Blue Sea.''
 &HT;    First up is ``Sexual Innocence,'' now in limited release.
Written and directed by Mike Figgis, the man behind ``Leaving Las
Vegas'' (1995), the movie explores various chapters in the life of
a filmmaker (Julian Sands), intercutting them with scenes depicting
the relationship between Adam and Eve. Burrows plays two
characters, twins raised in different countries.
 &HT;    Something of a cinematic curio, ``Sexual Innocence'' forgoes
standard storytelling structure, with images floating by like
thoughts. There are interracial relationships, violence and scenes
of child abuse, not to mention enough exposed flesh to make Hugh
Hefner blush.
 &HT;    ``I was immediately intrigued by the way Mike wrote it,'' says
Burrows, a tall, beautiful redhead, during an interview in the
Manhattan offices of the film's publicist. ``He broke all kinds of
screenwriting rules and popular myths, which made it liberating to
read.
 &HT;    ``I love films, but am rather disappointed by what's out there
at the moment,'' she says. ``So much of it is inane and often
doesn't require any intelligence at all to take in.
 &HT;    ``You just sit there and let it wash over you. You can't do that
with this film.''
 &HT;    Burrows has seen the film with audiences in America, Germany,
France and Ireland, and she finds that it affects different people
in different ways.
 &HT;    ``It's amazing,'' she says. ``Everyone seems to have very
radical, polarized responses. I've seen people left with images in
their mind that they've embraced, with ideas they love or don't
agree with, that led to some kind of debate.
 &HT;    ``The film certainly inspires conversation, on the sexual and
physical level, on the level of race,'' she concludes. ``How often
does a film challenge you?''
 &HT;    It was a challenging film to make as well, especially for
Burrows, who for the first time was taking direction from Figgis,
her offscreen beau of two-plus years.
 &HT;    ``Whatever is going on privately, my sense is that you have to
behave with professionalism and with the same sense of respect and
cooperation you would on any film,'' Burrows says, clearly
uncomfortable with the subject. ``You have to maintain that with
everyone and not tip the balance.
 &HT;    ``Mike was probably tougher on me than he might have been on
someone else,'' she adds. ``When you know people well, you're more
tough on them. And I was more tough on myself.''
 &HT;    During a separate conversation, Figgis sheds additional light on
the realities of mixing business and pleasure on the set.
 &HT;    ``You're much crueler,'' he says. ``In a working relationship
you've got to be seen as being much tougher on that person than you
would be on another actor.
 &HT;    ``You can't favor that actor, and you've got to push that actor
even more,'' he says. ``Saffron understood that. On the other hand,
you've got something that is quite personal, which is quite
fragile, too, and you don't want to squash that.''
 &HT;    Figgis stares at the ground.
 &HT;    ``It's f--king difficult,'' he says. ``You can't relax in that
relationship. The good news is that Saffron is really talented and
has a vibrancy that the camera captures, and it pays off. She'll
blow everybody away in `Miss Julie.'''
 &HT;    ``Miss Julie,'' also directed by Figgis, is an adaptation of
August Strindberg's classic stage drama. Shot in a mere three
weeks, ``Miss Julie'' stars Burrows as the title character, an
aristocrat in love with a commoner.
 &HT;    ``It stays very true to the play, but it's incredibly filmic,''
Burrows says. ``It's very literate, which scared investors and
distributors. Now, though, people are watching bits and pieces of
it and they're realizing that it's really a movie.
 &HT;    ``Hopefully people will get a chance to see it soon.''
 &HT;    One film that definitely won't have trouble finding a
distributor is the anything-but-highbrow ``Deep Blue Sea,'' opening
July 30. The Renny Harlin thriller offers genetically enhanced
sharks biting back at their creator (Burrows) and a group of
scientists (including Samuel L. Jackson, Stellan Skarsgard, Thomas
Jane and L.L. Cool J) after a tropical storm traps everyone on a
research rig adrift on the Pacific Ocean.
 &HT;    It's an unabashedly commercial undertaking, and Burrows makes no
apologies for that.
 &HT;    ``Big movies open doors, or they can if people go,'' she says.
``I wanted to do `Deep Blue Sea' because I was drawn to the cast.
`Deep Blue Sea' is a big studio movie with a big budget, but it had
more going for it, in my opinion, than most studio movies.''
 &HT;    Burrows has taken a different road to her event-movie debut than
the average model-turned-actress. Born in England, she modeled from
1988 until 1994, and _ unlike many former models _ she doesn't
knock the job, grateful for the money she earned and for the
freedom to travel and pursue her dream of acting.
 &HT;    ``For me, acting meant a chance to do something _ a film, a play
_ that could affect the way someone feels about an issue, be it
political or emotional, that could push you to go out and change
things,'' she says. ``That may sound very naive, but I was about 10
years old when I discovered the films of Ken Loach, and they had
such a profound impact on me.
 &HT;    ``I remember walking out of the cinema feeling very alive after
seeing his films,'' she says. ``I also remember being inspired by
Vanessa Redgrave after seeing her in a play. I thought, `What an
amazing marriage of activism and performing _ maybe I could do
that.'''
 &HT;    Redgrave recently turned 62, and in 1997 celebrated the 40th
anniversary of her stage debut. Still a relative newcomer, Burrows
finds it hard to imagine so long and prolific a career as
Redgrave's.
 &HT;    ``Wow,'' she says, nodding her head in thought. ``Forty years.
To be honest, I don't know.
 &HT;    ``I'd love to have a couple of kids,'' she says after a moment.
``I'd like to do so many things. I'd like to think that I'll still
be acting _ but even in a year, so much can happen in one's life.
 &HT;    ``I love what I'm doing now and I hope I'll always love it,''
she says. ``I just don't want to peak at the age of 26!''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When ``Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' premiered on January 4,
1993, critics gushed over its inventiveness, but fans were divided,
even worried.
</P>
<P>
   The original ``Star Trek'' _ and its hit successor, ``Star Trek:
The Next Generation'' _ had been built around a starship, the
legendary U.S.S. Enterprise. How exciting could this new,
determinedly stationary ``Star Trek'' series be, set aboard a space
station?
</P>
<P>
   Could anyone boldly go nowhere at all?
</P>
<P>
   As that first season progressed, however, it became apparent
that ``DS9'' wasn't so much an action-adventure series like its
predecessors _ it was more like a soap opera that just happened to
be set in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not about boldly going where no man has gone before,''
admits Armin Shimerman, who plays Quark, the opportunistic Ferengi.
``We were about boldly staying in one place. And because we stayed
in one place, we got to investigate the lives of the people on the
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did originally try to imitate `The Next Generation's'
format of one-stop adventures,'' Shimerman says, ``but our writers
soon realized it was more interesting to find out what made the
characters tick and seeing how they interrelated with other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nana Visitor, who has played the stern Bajoran, Col. Kira Nerys,
since that first season, agrees that this was an unusual ``Star
Trek.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus was on the relationships between the characters,''
she says. ``I think it was the best thing we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Those onscreen relationships inevitably were reflected offscreen
as well, which made the taping of the final episode all the more
difficult. Shimerman called it ``a very emotional day,'' while Rene
Auberjonois, who plays stoic Security Officer Odo, reveals that a
pivotal scene in the final episode gathers all of the cast together
in the nightclub holosuite owned by Vic Fontaine (James Darren).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice that we spent that last day of shooting with all
of us situated at sort of a goodbye party,'' Auberjonois says. ``It
wasn't the last scene of the episode, but it was the last scene we
shot. That had a very nice feeling, because we were all there and
when we shot the last shot we all said goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitor reports that she and her castmates took as long as they
possibly could to film those final few scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a bit of that last-day-of-school feeling _ no one
was going to behave very well,'' she says with a laugh. ``It was
emotional, and it was hard not to hug someone every two seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitor's emotional attachment to the series is probably greater
than that of most of the cast: She met her husband _ Alexander
Siddig, who plays the brilliant Dr. Julian Bashir _ on the set. At
the final taping, he was busy snapping behind-the-scenes photos for
their family album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are enough pictures for a whole album all by
itself,'' she says. ``And that's just that last day!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was no surprise to those involved that this would
be the show's final year. The entire cast and crew came into this
seventh season knowing that it would be their last.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was the end back in July, when we started shooting
the current season,'' Shimerman says. ``It was sad in the sense
that something we had done for seven years was coming to an end.
For many of us it was the longest job we'd ever had as actors.''
</P>
<P>
   From an acting standpoint, the Broadway veteran says that the
final episode itself was an emotional event, but it was almost a
relief when the very last scene finally wrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of like a great Thanksgiving feast that had gone
on for seven years,'' Auberjonois says. ``Everybody was stuffed to
the gills and satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though emotions ran high throughout the taping of the final
show, the true finality of the situation was felt only during the
private gathering held after the shoot was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one hell of a cast party,'' Shimerman says. ``We had a
wonderful time _ it was a beautiful night, people were all decked
out. There were a lot of tears, a lot of hugs, a lot of exchanging
of phone numbers. It was a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as details of the final episode itself are concerned,
Paramount is keeping them under heavy wraps. In fact, trying to pry
any specifics out of the cast is like trying to get Worf to smile.
Some snippets did emerge here and there, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first hour concentrates on the final, apocalyptic battle
between the Federation and the Dominion,'' Auberjonois says. ``The
second half will focus on the aftermath and the tying-up of all the
loose ends of all the stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Shimerman admits, the finale does leave some hanging
threads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of the characters' loose ends will be resolved,'' he
says, ``but the major ones will be.''
</P>
<P>
   One scene in the closing minutes is sure to please devoted fans,
however. It's set in Quark's Bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that Quark closes up the bar and says `Last
call' to everybody,'' Shimerman says slyly. ``That's all I'm going
to give you.''
</P>
<P>
   To judge by Visitor's comments, however, the final episode may
not bode well for Col. Nerys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was upsetting to me when I read the script,'' the actress
says. ``It's not everybody's happy bye-bye. Things change ...
things definitely change.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast naturally hopes that fans will regard their final
outing as a fitting wrap-up for the series. But Auberjonois doesn't
promise that everyone will leave pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be spectacular, certainly,'' he says, ``but the truth
is, for the audience that has watched us for seven years and has
been passionate about the show, some will be thrilled while some
will be disappointed. You can't satisfy everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Deep Space Nine'' leaving the air, ``Star Trek: Voyager''
becomes the sole franchise representative on the air, the first
time in nearly eight years that only one ``Trek'' has been
available. But Trekkers shouldn't hold their breaths for a fourth
spinoff series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who work on `Star Trek' believe to some extent
that there has already been too much `Star Trek,''' Shimerman says,
sighing. ``And I personally would like that there not be another
one.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, infinite possibilities in Gene Roddenberry's
universe. The nine ``Star Trek'' films have earned nearly a billion
dollars since 1979. Could the silver screen be the next destination
for Capt. Sisko and the DS9 crew?
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'd love to think there would be a movie or
something for us after the series,'' Visitor says. ``That would be
wonderful.''

 Includes a color slide of Cuba Gooding Jr. with Anthony Hopkins in
a scene from ``Instinct.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Don't show him the money.
 &HT;    Just show him to a quiet table, a quiet back room, even a quiet
back door so Cuba Gooding Jr. can get away from the people who want
to hear The Line.
 &HT;    ``Say it,'' begs a teen-age boy in baggy jeans. ``You must say
it, man!''
 &HT;    ``Please say it,'' says a young woman on Michigan Avenue in
downtown Chicago. ``My friend over there is sick, and she would
feel better if you said it just once.''
 &HT;    Even at a local hamburger joint, the request swells to a general
chorus that even a determinedly low-profile Gooding can't ignore.
 &HT;    And give him this much, when the actor does anything, it's in a
big way.
 &HT;    Suddenly, he catapults up from a booth, his hips swiveling and
his head grooving to some imaginary beat.
 &HT;    ``Shoooow me the moonnn-aaaaay!'' he shrieks, and his fans burst
into applause,
 &HT;    Sure, a few older patrons look at him and clearly write him off
as another young guy who's obviously snapped. But everyone else
knows beyond a doubt that Cuba Gooding Jr. is in town.
 &HT;    Actually, Gooding says later as he relaxes in a luxury suite at
Chicago's Four Seasons Hotel, that was his character in ``Jerry
Maguire'' (1996). The actor himself doesn't need to be shown the
money.
 &HT;    ``I actually drive my agents crazy,'' he says, ``because they'll
want to negotiate a bigger salary for me on projects that I really
want to do. But if I get any resistance from the studio, I just
immediately go, `OK, fine. I'll take whatever they're offering me.'
 &HT;    ``The studios are willing to pay me big bucks to do an action
movie,'' Gooding adds, ``but I turn those down all the time. I
don't want the people who follow my movies to leave the theater
going, `He did that one for the cash!'''
 &HT;    So you know that it wasn't for the money that he signed on to
film ``Instinct,'' opening nationwide on June 4. Based on Daniel
Quinn's book ``Ishmael,'' the film casts him as a psychiatrist
assigned to evaluate a famous primatologist (Anthony Hopkins)
accused of ``going native,'' living among the gorillas he studies
and ultimately murdering two park rangers.
 &HT;    The money didn't enter into it, Gooding says. More important was
the chance to work with the Oscar-winning Hopkins ... and to redeem
himself in the British actor's eyes.
 &HT;    Wincing, he recalls their first meeting, at a 1997 industry
showcase.
 &HT;    ``It was so embarrassing,'' Gooding says, shaking his head.
``All I saw was the back of this bald head. Someone says to me,
`That's Tony Hopkins.' And I said, `Oh, no it's not. It's Lester
from the `Addams Family.'''
 &HT;    At which point, the man turned and gave him all the frost that
you'd expect from the eye of Sir Anthony Hopkins.
 &HT;    ``I gasped and said, `Oh, hello, Mr. Hopkins, nice to meet
you,''' Gooding adds. ``He wasn't mad for a moment, so I
impulsively wrapped my arms around him and gave him a big hug. Tony
then whispered to me, `So, kid, you're going to do that movie,
aren't you? The movie with the apes?'
 &HT;    ``I had no clue what he was talking about at the time.''
 &HT;    At that moment, the script for ``Instinct'' was lying amid a
pile that had flooded into his office since he had won a Best
Supporting Actor Oscar as football player Rod Tidwell in ``Jerry
Maguire.''
 &HT;    ``The Oscar was like this sonic boom,'' Gooding says. ``I went
from, `Oh, look, it's that guy from ``Boyz N the Hood''' to `Hey,
Cuba my man!'''
 &HT;    Since collecting his statuette, Gooding has put Jack Nicholson
in his place as a gay art dealer in ``As Good As It Gets'' (1997)
and toured heaven and hell with Robin Williams in ``What Dreams May
Come'' (1998), almost certainly the only film in which he'll ever
play Williams' son. He was even able to raise enough cash to
produce his first feature, ``A Murder of Crows,'' a thriller
starring Eric Stoltz that's due for release later this year.
 &HT;    And he's having fun, which should come as no surprise to anyone
who saw his exuberant acceptance speech at the Oscars. No one could
call him inhibited.
 &HT;    ``Cuba has no fear,'' Williams said during a ``What Dreams''
interview. ``What I love about him the most is that at the drop of
a hat he'll drop his trousers.''
 &HT;    Actually, yes. Even when the script calls for nudity, though _
as it does in one of his upcoming films _ Gooding can manage to
surprise people.
 &HT;    ``I had to do this really passionate love scene,'' he recalls,
bounding to his feet to set the scene. ``So I said, `Can I get the
whole crew in here, please?' I was really serious. I adjusted my
robe and I said, `Listen, this is a very big day. I don't want any
laughing.'
 &HT;    ``Then I dropped the robe,'' he says, deadpan. ``My assistant
had made this prosthetic penis _ he stuffed a stocking with
cellophane. Well, the whole crew cracked. The tension evaporated.
Afterward it didn't matter how long we were naked that day, it just
didn't matter.''
 &HT;    Gooding was 23 when he dazzled audiences in ``Boyz N the Hood''
(1991). He expected a major career to ensue, but few offers
appeared, and most of them were highly derivative of ``Boyz.''
 &HT;    ``I was offered dozens of inner-city movies, but I passed,'' he
says. ``I also didn't want to play the villain or the good-bad guy
_ I always wanted to be a leading man.''
 &HT;    Roles in ``Lightning Jack'' (1994) and ``Outbreak'' (1995) led
to an audition for ``Jerry Maguire'' _ opposite Robin Williams, who
briefly considered the title role that later went to Tom Cruise.
 &HT;    A year later, Gooding was thanking the Academy and his wife, a
teacher named Sara. The Goodings live in Los Angeles with their
sons, 5-year-old Spencer and 2-year-old Mason. They also have three
Great Danes _ Pitch Black, Woodrow and Lollipop.
 &HT;    A self-described ``homebody,'' Gooding says he isn't one for the
Hollywood circuit of parties and premieres.
 &HT;    ``A big night is Pay-Per-View,'' he says.
 &HT;    The other night, he adds, he even caught ``Jerry Maguire'' on
cable.
 &HT;    ``I immediately got caught up in it,'' the actor says. ``But
then I had to turn it off, because I started thinking, `That's the
best you're ever going to be.' I had to stop looking at it.''
 &HT;    He sighs.
 &HT;    ``Winning the Oscar is tricky,'' he says. ``It starts you off on
having internal dialogues you never thought you'd have.''
 &HT;    And besides, it can make you crazy after a while.
 &HT;    ``The only bad part of winning the Oscar,'' he adds, ``was that
I went home that night and my nanny had Spencer waiting on the
driveway. The minute I stepped out of the limo, the nanny was like,
`OK, say it to Daddy.' Spencer yawns and says, `Show me da money,
daddy.'
 &HT;    ``I looked at my nanny like, `I'll kill you!''' Gooding says,
laughing. ``I'm standing in my driveway screaming, `No, no, no!'''

WHISTLING DIXIE: HOW THE DIXIE CHICKS RUFFLED NASHVILLE'S
FEATHERS

 Includes a color slide of Martie Seidel, Emily Erwin and Natalie
Maines, the Dixie Chicks. 
 By BOB PAXMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    They're three women who dress like alternative-rock stars but
play a mixture of straight country, pop and bluegrass. They go by a
slightly tongue-in-cheek name, the Dixie Chicks.
 &HT;    In a word, they're so un-Nashville, yet the Dixie Chicks find
themselves ruling the country roost, and the Nashville
establishment has been forced to pay attention to them, like it or
not.
 &HT;    The Dixie Chicks _ fiddle player Martie Seidel,
multi-instrumentalist Emily Erwin and lead vocalist Natalie Maines
_ burst practically unknown onto the country scene in January 1998.
In little more than a year they've managed to ruffle the feathers
of normally placid Music Row _ which isn't that hard, but the
Chicks have gotten away with it, which is much rarer.
 &HT;    Their escape hatch, of course, has been popularity, which
translates into one thing that even Nashville can't ignore: money.
 &HT;    Their debut album, ``Wide Open Spaces,'' recently reached the 5
million sales mark. Its first single, ``I Can Love You Better,''
soared into the top 10, and the followups, ``There's Your Trouble''
and the album's title cut, both hit No. 1 on the country charts.
Country Music Association Awards and two Grammy Awards were simply
icing on the cake.
 &HT;    All this from virtually nowhere, leaving the country world
scratching its head and asking, ``Who are these women, and how are
they doing this?''
 &HT;    The look and the sound are both part of it, Erwin says.
 &HT;    ``Three women doing what we do is just so different in itself,''
says the tallest of the trio, who plays banjo, guitar, dobro and
mandolin. ``The fact that we play our own instruments has a lot to
do with our signature sound. People probably look at us playing
fiddles and banjos or whatever and think, `What are they doing up
there?'
 &HT;    ``But it's fun for us, and I think we are breaking a lot of
stereotypes.''
 &HT;    They've also latched onto a particular audience, mainly women in
their 20s _ as all three Chicks happen to be _ looking for feisty
role models. ``I Can Love You Better'' and ``There's Your Trouble''
embody a certain edginess without giving way to the anger that
seems to drive some other female pop acts.
 &HT;    ``We are a little partial to songs like that,'' Erwin agrees.
``There's a psychology behind it, you know, `You're seeing the
wrong one, buddy!' But we're just calling it like it is. People
like things in plain English.''
 &HT;    She laughs.
 &HT;    ``It reminds me of a lot of Tammy Wynette's songs,'' she adds.
``She was always saying, `Girl, get your head out of your
you-know-what,' and I loved her for that reason.''
 &HT;    Once you establish yourself in that vein, of course, you get
pitched similar songs by everyone with an ax to grind. And, yes,
the Chicks are getting more than their share.
 &HT;    ``We're getting piles and piles of `attitude' songs,'' Erwin
reports, chuckling. ``Guess there's an awful lot of 'tude out
there.
 &HT;    ``But that's not our M.O. at all,'' she says. ``The song `Wide
Open Spaces' has a lot of depth to it. `Once You've Loved Somebody'
is a great ballad. So there's no formula for a Chicks song _ if we
like it and we think we can put our harmonies to it, that's all we
need.''
 &HT;    Incidentally, the Chicks aren't really from Dixie. All three are
Texas natives, actually. Seidel and Erwin are sisters who were
already veterans of the music business by the time they _ and two
since-departed partners, Laura Lynch and Robin Macy _ founded the
Chicks in 1989.
 &HT;    The sisters got their first experience in six years of touring
the country as members of Blue Night Express, a teen bluegrass
group. The Chicks were officially hatched in an informal way, when
the four _ Seidel then 19 and Erwin 16 _ took their instruments to
a Dallas street corner and started playing for tips.
 &HT;    It wasn't meant as the start of something big, Seidel recalls,
but something clicked.
 &HT;    ``We knew there was something magical _ or at least lucrative _
about women playing music together,'' she says. ``The only problem
was we didn't have a name.''
 &HT;    Finding one wasn't easy, as the performers struggled for a tag
that they'd all go for. One morning, though, the answer came out of
thin air _ literally, since it was on the radio that they happened
to hear the Little Feat song ``Dixie Chicken.''
 &HT;    One syllable-extraction later _ Seidel didn't like the idea of
being a chicken _ they had a name.
 &HT;    But though they found ample bookings at clubs and dance halls
around Texas, the Chicks couldn't get any record companies
interested. It took six more years for the missing ingredient to
arrive, in the form of Maines.
 &HT;    The daughter of producer/musician Lloyd Maines, she'd heard the
band several times during her days as a college student in Lubbock,
Texas. Liking their style, she sent the sisters a demo tape in 1995
_ as it happened, just when the search was on for a replacement
Chick.
 &HT;    Seidel and Erwin admired not only Maines' voice, but also the
somewhat brazen personality she brought to her singing. Blonde and
brassy with a lilting soprano, Maines brought a Marilyn Monroe
spark to the Chicks' country style.
 &HT;    ``Our music evolved to this point once Natalie came in,'' Seidel
says. ``It took finding Natalie to make us say, `We've got
something.' That was the best thing that ever happened to Emily and
me.''
 &HT;    The band, now a trio, clicked almost immediately. And in 1997,
when Sony Music Entertainment decided to relaunch Monument Records,
former home to Roy Orbison and other country-pop legends, the first
act it signed was the Dixie Chicks.
 &HT;    The rest is, if not history, at least yesterday's news. Leaving
the obvious question, is there anywhere to go but down?
 &HT;    Unsurprisingly, the Chicks think their ride is only beginning.
 &HT;    ``One of our biggest goals is to write more of our own
material,'' Erwin says. ``Not long ago we went on a songwriter's
retreat outside Nashville and worked with all these great writers.
It was important for us to learn more about the craft of writing,
because we are new songwriters in relation to a lot of other
people.''
 &HT;    If you're wondering what sort of tunes the Chicks would write on
their own behalf, you won't have to wait long to find out.
 &HT;    ``We already have a handful of songs that we'll be recording for
our next album,'' Erwin reports.
 &HT;    That album, as yet untitled, is scheduled for release Aug. 31.
And the country-music world, which was generally skeptical about
the Chicks' chances as recently as a year ago, is predicting great
things.
 &HT;    Apparently the Dixie Chicks _ name, look and all-girl status
intact _ aren't the marketing problem that they once seemed.
Country audiences have a wider range of interest than many
observers had predicted, and the Chicks aren't ``too different'' to
succeed.
 &HT;    ``We heard a lot of that,'' Erwin admits.
 &HT;    In the end, she says, the marketing strategy wound up to be a
simple one _ let the Chicks be what they are.
 &HT;    ``We are not something that's been manufactured,'' she explains.
``We're real, we play our own instruments, which is kind of bizarre
to a lot of people. Maybe we were considered different or odd or
something _ but, you know, people who take the greatest chances
often make the greatest gains.
 &HT;    ``We tried to reinvent the wheel a million times, before
realizing what the essence of Dixie Chicks really is,'' she
concludes. ``Now we are definitely going to do this on our own
terms.''

Sexual Innocence.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Any minute now Saffron Burrows may find herself a movie star,
but if she ends up famous it won't be her fault.
 &HT;    ``It's undeniable that receiving a compliment from someone you
admire _ a friend, journalist, politician _ is a wonderful
feeling,'' the British actress says. ``But there's a very large
difference between that and the mad, mad, mad world of celebrity.
 &HT;    ``I've gotten a small taste of it, but I've seen it really
happen to people I know, and it can be scary and disorienting,''
she says. ``It's nothing I want for myself.''
 &HT;    The 26-year-old Burrows first generated buzz as the chic,
popular one of the three Irish friends in the surprise hit ``Circle
of Friends'' (1995). More recently she's juggled projects both
mainstream and offbeat, starring in the misbegotten big-screen
version of ``Wing Commander'' (1999) and in three upcoming films _
two of them the independent features ``The Loss of Sexual
Innocence'' and ``Miss Julie,'' the third a big-budget thriller,
``Deep Blue Sea.''
 &HT;    First up is ``Sexual Innocence,'' now in limited release.
Written and directed by Mike Figgis, the man behind ``Leaving Las
Vegas'' (1995), the movie explores various chapters in the life of
a filmmaker (Julian Sands), intercutting them with scenes depicting
the relationship between Adam and Eve. Burrows plays two
characters, twins raised in different countries.
 &HT;    Something of a cinematic curio, ``Sexual Innocence'' forgoes
standard storytelling structure, with images floating by like
thoughts. There are interracial relationships, violence and scenes
of child abuse, not to mention enough exposed flesh to make Hugh
Hefner blush.
 &HT;    ``I was immediately intrigued by the way Mike wrote it,'' says
Burrows, a tall, beautiful redhead, during an interview in the
Manhattan offices of the film's publicist. ``He broke all kinds of
screenwriting rules and popular myths, which made it liberating to
read.
 &HT;    ``I love films, but am rather disappointed by what's out there
at the moment,'' she says. ``So much of it is inane and often
doesn't require any intelligence at all to take in.
 &HT;    ``You just sit there and let it wash over you. You can't do that
with this film.''
 &HT;    Burrows has seen the film with audiences in America, Germany,
France and Ireland, and she finds that it affects different people
in different ways.
 &HT;    ``It's amazing,'' she says. ``Everyone seems to have very
radical, polarized responses. I've seen people left with images in
their mind that they've embraced, with ideas they love or don't
agree with, that led to some kind of debate.
 &HT;    ``The film certainly inspires conversation, on the sexual and
physical level, on the level of race,'' she concludes. ``How often
does a film challenge you?''
 &HT;    It was a challenging film to make as well, especially for
Burrows, who for the first time was taking direction from Figgis,
her offscreen beau of two-plus years.
 &HT;    ``Whatever is going on privately, my sense is that you have to
behave with professionalism and with the same sense of respect and
cooperation you would on any film,'' Burrows says, clearly
uncomfortable with the subject. ``You have to maintain that with
everyone and not tip the balance.
 &HT;    ``Mike was probably tougher on me than he might have been on
someone else,'' she adds. ``When you know people well, you're more
tough on them. And I was more tough on myself.''
 &HT;    During a separate conversation, Figgis sheds additional light on
the realities of mixing business and pleasure on the set.
 &HT;    ``You're much crueler,'' he says. ``In a working relationship
you've got to be seen as being much tougher on that person than you
would be on another actor.
 &HT;    ``You can't favor that actor, and you've got to push that actor
even more,'' he says. ``Saffron understood that. On the other hand,
you've got something that is quite personal, which is quite
fragile, too, and you don't want to squash that.''
 &HT;    Figgis stares at the ground.
 &HT;    ``It's f--king difficult,'' he says. ``You can't relax in that
relationship. The good news is that Saffron is really talented and
has a vibrancy that the camera captures, and it pays off. She'll
blow everybody away in `Miss Julie.'''
 &HT;    ``Miss Julie,'' also directed by Figgis, is an adaptation of
August Strindberg's classic stage drama. Shot in a mere three
weeks, ``Miss Julie'' stars Burrows as the title character, an
aristocrat in love with a commoner.
 &HT;    ``It stays very true to the play, but it's incredibly filmic,''
Burrows says. ``It's very literate, which scared investors and
distributors. Now, though, people are watching bits and pieces of
it and they're realizing that it's really a movie.
 &HT;    ``Hopefully people will get a chance to see it soon.''
 &HT;    One film that definitely won't have trouble finding a
distributor is the anything-but-highbrow ``Deep Blue Sea,'' opening
July 30. The Renny Harlin thriller offers genetically enhanced
sharks biting back at their creator (Burrows) and a group of
scientists (including Samuel L. Jackson, Stellan Skarsgard, Thomas
Jane and L.L. Cool J) after a tropical storm traps everyone on a
research rig adrift on the Pacific Ocean.
 &HT;    It's an unabashedly commercial undertaking, and Burrows makes no
apologies for that.
 &HT;    ``Big movies open doors, or they can if people go,'' she says.
``I wanted to do `Deep Blue Sea' because I was drawn to the cast.
`Deep Blue Sea' is a big studio movie with a big budget, but it had
more going for it, in my opinion, than most studio movies.''
 &HT;    Burrows has taken a different road to her event-movie debut than
the average model-turned-actress. Born in England, she modeled from
1988 until 1994, and _ unlike many former models _ she doesn't
knock the job, grateful for the money she earned and for the
freedom to travel and pursue her dream of acting.
 &HT;    ``For me, acting meant a chance to do something _ a film, a play
_ that could affect the way someone feels about an issue, be it
political or emotional, that could push you to go out and change
things,'' she says. ``That may sound very naive, but I was about 10
years old when I discovered the films of Ken Loach, and they had
such a profound impact on me.
 &HT;    ``I remember walking out of the cinema feeling very alive after
seeing his films,'' she says. ``I also remember being inspired by
Vanessa Redgrave after seeing her in a play. I thought, `What an
amazing marriage of activism and performing _ maybe I could do
that.'''
 &HT;    Redgrave recently turned 62, and in 1997 celebrated the 40th
anniversary of her stage debut. Still a relative newcomer, Burrows
finds it hard to imagine so long and prolific a career as
Redgrave's.
 &HT;    ``Wow,'' she says, nodding her head in thought. ``Forty years.
To be honest, I don't know.
 &HT;    ``I'd love to have a couple of kids,'' she says after a moment.
``I'd like to do so many things. I'd like to think that I'll still
be acting _ but even in a year, so much can happen in one's life.
 &HT;    ``I love what I'm doing now and I hope I'll always love it,''
she says. ``I just don't want to peak at the age of 26!''

 Includes a color slide of Avery Brooks, Nana Visitor and Rene
Auberjonois in a scene from ``Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.'' 
 By BRIAN HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When ``Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' premiered on January 4,
1993, critics gushed over its inventiveness, but fans were divided,
even worried.
</P>
<P>
   The original ``Star Trek'' _ and its hit successor, ``Star Trek:
The Next Generation'' _ had been built around a starship, the
legendary U.S.S. Enterprise. How exciting could this new,
determinedly stationary ``Star Trek'' series be, set aboard a space
station?
</P>
<P>
   Could anyone boldly go nowhere at all?
</P>
<P>
   As that first season progressed, however, it became apparent
that ``DS9'' wasn't so much an action-adventure series like its
predecessors _ it was more like a soap opera that just happened to
be set in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not about boldly going where no man has gone before,''
admits Armin Shimerman, who plays Quark, the opportunistic Ferengi.
``We were about boldly staying in one place. And because we stayed
in one place, we got to investigate the lives of the people on the
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did originally try to imitate `The Next Generation's'
format of one-stop adventures,'' Shimerman says, ``but our writers
soon realized it was more interesting to find out what made the
characters tick and seeing how they interrelated with other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nana Visitor, who has played the stern Bajoran, Col. Kira Nerys,
since that first season, agrees that this was an unusual ``Star
Trek.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus was on the relationships between the characters,''
she says. ``I think it was the best thing we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Those onscreen relationships inevitably were reflected offscreen
as well, which made the taping of the final episode all the more
difficult. Shimerman called it ``a very emotional day,'' while Rene
Auberjonois, who plays stoic Security Officer Odo, reveals that a
pivotal scene in the final episode gathers all of the cast together
in the nightclub holosuite owned by Vic Fontaine (James Darren).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice that we spent that last day of shooting with all
of us situated at sort of a goodbye party,'' Auberjonois says. ``It
wasn't the last scene of the episode, but it was the last scene we
shot. That had a very nice feeling, because we were all there and
when we shot the last shot we all said goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitor reports that she and her castmates took as long as they
possibly could to film those final few scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a bit of that last-day-of-school feeling _ no one
was going to behave very well,'' she says with a laugh. ``It was
emotional, and it was hard not to hug someone every two seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitor's emotional attachment to the series is probably greater
than that of most of the cast: She met her husband _ Alexander
Siddig, who plays the brilliant Dr. Julian Bashir _ on the set. At
the final taping, he was busy snapping behind-the-scenes photos for
their family album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are enough pictures for a whole album all by
itself,'' she says. ``And that's just that last day!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was no surprise to those involved that this would
be the show's final year. The entire cast and crew came into this
seventh season knowing that it would be their last.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was the end back in July, when we started shooting
the current season,'' Shimerman says. ``It was sad in the sense
that something we had done for seven years was coming to an end.
For many of us it was the longest job we'd ever had as actors.''
</P>
<P>
   From an acting standpoint, the Broadway veteran says that the
final episode itself was an emotional event, but it was almost a
relief when the very last scene finally wrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of like a great Thanksgiving feast that had gone
on for seven years,'' Auberjonois says. ``Everybody was stuffed to
the gills and satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though emotions ran high throughout the taping of the final
show, the true finality of the situation was felt only during the
private gathering held after the shoot was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one hell of a cast party,'' Shimerman says. ``We had a
wonderful time _ it was a beautiful night, people were all decked
out. There were a lot of tears, a lot of hugs, a lot of exchanging
of phone numbers. It was a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as details of the final episode itself are concerned,
Paramount is keeping them under heavy wraps. In fact, trying to pry
any specifics out of the cast is like trying to get Worf to smile.
Some snippets did emerge here and there, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first hour concentrates on the final, apocalyptic battle
between the Federation and the Dominion,'' Auberjonois says. ``The
second half will focus on the aftermath and the tying-up of all the
loose ends of all the stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Shimerman admits, the finale does leave some hanging
threads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of the characters' loose ends will be resolved,'' he
says, ``but the major ones will be.''
</P>
<P>
   One scene in the closing minutes is sure to please devoted fans,
however. It's set in Quark's Bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that Quark closes up the bar and says `Last
call' to everybody,'' Shimerman says slyly. ``That's all I'm going
to give you.''
</P>
<P>
   To judge by Visitor's comments, however, the final episode may
not bode well for Col. Nerys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was upsetting to me when I read the script,'' the actress
says. ``It's not everybody's happy bye-bye. Things change ...
things definitely change.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast naturally hopes that fans will regard their final
outing as a fitting wrap-up for the series. But Auberjonois doesn't
promise that everyone will leave pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be spectacular, certainly,'' he says, ``but the truth
is, for the audience that has watched us for seven years and has
been passionate about the show, some will be thrilled while some
will be disappointed. You can't satisfy everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Deep Space Nine'' leaving the air, ``Star Trek: Voyager''
becomes the sole franchise representative on the air, the first
time in nearly eight years that only one ``Trek'' has been
available. But Trekkers shouldn't hold their breaths for a fourth
spinoff series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who work on `Star Trek' believe to some extent
that there has already been too much `Star Trek,''' Shimerman says,
sighing. ``And I personally would like that there not be another
one.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, infinite possibilities in Gene Roddenberry's
universe. The nine ``Star Trek'' films have earned nearly a billion
dollars since 1979. Could the silver screen be the next destination
for Capt. Sisko and the DS9 crew?
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'd love to think there would be a movie or
something for us after the series,'' Visitor says. ``That would be
wonderful.''

SPYING ISN'T THE ONLY WAY TO LEARN ABOUT NUKES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Now that a congressional committee has released its
three-volume, 872-page techno-thriller on the theft of atomic
secrets by Chinese spies, much of Washington is agog. But the
uproar overlooks an arresting fact. For more than a half decade,
the Clinton administration was shoveling atomic secrets out the
door as fast as it could, literally by the ton. Millions of
previously classified ideas and documents relating to nuclear arms
were released to all comers, including China's bomb makers.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of that giveaway and what it helped accomplish, its
architects say, is perhaps ultimately more important than the
congressional nail-biter, even though the tale is subtle and the
accomplishments are not what you might expect from disclosures on
how to make bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1993, when the terrors of the Cold War were still fresh,
the administration decided that the best way to keep the nuclear
arms race from heating up again was to get the world's nations to
sign a test-ban treaty. The idea was that even if a country knew
how to make a bomb, it couldn't perfect new ones and build up
advanced forces without physically testing new designs. So
development of new weapons would be frozen, ending the vicious
spiral of nuclear move and countermove.
</P>
<P>
   Releasing many of America's nuclear secrets was seen as an
essential part of this strategy, since it would signal a new global
order in which nuclear know-how was suddenly and irreparably
devalued and real security would lie in the collective knowledge
that nobody was able to push weaponry beyond the known boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   What had been gold would become dross, and the atom would lose
power and prestige. Driven by such logic, the administration made
public masses of generalities about nuclear arms, even as specific
weapon designs were kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, critics charge that the gamble failed _ that the
explosion last year of nuclear devices by India and Pakistan and
the reports that China has stolen America's top designs for nuclear
arms have demonstrated that the test ban is fatally flawed. The
depth and breadth of China's spying, they add, make the world's
largest state seem quite hungry for a thoroughly modernized nuclear
force, test-ban treaty or no.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the China scandal, the Clinton administration has
stopped all declassifications, beefed up security at the national
weapons laboratories and adopted a conciliatory tone. Last week. as
the House select committee released its report, President Clinton
called protecting atom secrets ``a solemn obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   But in private, administration officials say the openness was
smart after all, its advantages even now outweighing its risks.
They insist that its crowning jewel, the test ban, while admittedly
shaky, still has lessened the risk of new atomic advances, making
it a potent force for international good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pulled off an impossible feat,'' said Hazel O'Leary, keeper
of the nation's atom secrets as secretary of energy from 1993 to
1997. ``To say all our efforts were negative is not to understand
the benefits, not to see what we did in terms of building
international trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics disagree vehemently. But they say the giveaway
nonetheless illuminates the spy scandal and helps explain the
administration's slow response when confronted with evidence of
spying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nothing short of miraculous if the openness has
not seriously damaged U.S. interests,'' said Frank Gaffney Jr., a
Pentagon official during the Reagan administration who now directs
the Center for Security Policy, a research group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, officials say, the Energy Department's ``openness
initiative'' has released at least 178 categories of atom secrets.
By contrast, the 1980s saw two such actions. The unveilings have
included no details of specific weapons, like the W-88, a compact
design Chinese spies are suspected of having stolen from the
weapons lab at Los Alamos, N.M. But they include a slew of general
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Its overview of the disclosures, ``Restricted Data
Declassification Decisions,'' dated January 1999 and more than 140
pages long, lists such things as how atom bombs can be boosted in
power, key steps in making hydrogen bombs, the minimum amount (8.8
pounds) of plutonium or uranium fuel needed for an atom bomb and
the maximum time it takes an exploding atomic bomb to ignite an
H-bomb's hydrogen fuel (100 millionths of a second).
</P>
<P>
   No grade-B physicist from any university could figure this
stuff. It took decades of experience gained at a cost of more than
$400 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the secrets started as a high-stakes bet that
openness would lessen, not increase, the world's vulnerability to
nuclear arms and war. John Holum, who heads arms control at the
State Department, told Congress last year that the test ban
``essentially eliminates'' the possibility of a renewed
international race to develop new kinds of nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   And the devaluing of nuclear secrets, highlighted by the rush of
atomic declassifications, was seen as a prerequisite to the ban's
achievement. The symbolism alone was potent, officials say.
Openness let them advertise a dramatic new state of affairs where
hidden actions were to be kept to a minimum, replacing decades of
secrecy and paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States must stand as leader,'' O'Leary told a
packed news conference in December 1993 upon starting the process.
``We are declassifying the largest amount of information in the
history of the department.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, say the former secrets are extremely valuable
to foreign powers intent on making nuclear headway. Gaffney, the
former Reagan official, disparaged the giveaway as ``dangling
goodies in front of people to get them to sign up into our
arms-control agenda.''

that nobody was able to push weaponry beyond the known boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   What had been gold would become dross, and the atom would lose
power and prestige. Driven by such logic, the administration made
public masses of generalities about nuclear arms, even as specific
weapon designs were kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, critics charge that the gamble failed _ that the
explosion last year of nuclear devices by India and Pakistan and
the reports that China has stolen America's top designs for nuclear
arms have demonstrated that the test ban is fatally flawed. The
depth and breadth of China's spying, they add, make the world's
largest state seem quite hungry for a thoroughly modernized nuclear
force, test-ban treaty or no.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the China scandal, the Clinton administration has
stopped all declassifications, beefed up security at the national
weapons laboratories and adopted a conciliatory tone. Last week. as
the House select committee released its report, President Clinton
called protecting atom secrets ``a solemn obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   But in private, administration officials say the openness was
smart after all, its advantages even now outweighing its risks.
They insist that its crowning jewel, the test ban, while admittedly
shaky, still has lessened the risk of new atomic advances, making
it a potent force for international good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pulled off an impossible feat,'' said Hazel O'Leary, keeper
of the nation's atom secrets as secretary of energy from 1993 to
1997. ``To say all our efforts were negative is not to understand
the benefits, not to see what we did in terms of building
international trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics disagree vehemently. But they say the giveaway
nonetheless illuminates the spy scandal and helps explain the
administration's slow response when confronted with evidence of
spying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nothing short of miraculous if the openness has
not seriously damaged U.S. interests,'' said Frank Gaffney Jr., a
Pentagon official during the Reagan administration who now directs
the Center for Security Policy, a research group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, officials say, the Energy Department's ``openness
initiative'' has released at least 178 categories of atom secrets.
By contrast, the 1980s saw two such actions. The unveilings have
included no details of specific weapons, like the W-88, a compact
design Chinese spies are suspected of having stolen from the
weapons lab at Los Alamos, N.M. But they include a slew of general
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Its overview of the disclosures, ``Restricted Data
Declassification Decisions,'' dated January 1999 and more than 140
pages long, lists such things as how atom bombs can be boosted in
power, key steps in making hydrogen bombs, the minimum amount (8.8
pounds) of plutonium or uranium fuel needed for an atom bomb and
the maximum time it takes an exploding atomic bomb to ignite an
H-bomb's hydrogen fuel (100 millionths of a second).
</P>
<P>
   No grade-B physicist from any university could figure this
stuff. It took decades of experience gained at a cost of more than
$400 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the secrets started as a high-stakes bet that
openness would lessen, not increase, the world's vulnerability to
nuclear arms and war. John Holum, who heads arms control at the
State Department, told Congress last year that the test ban
``essentially eliminates'' the possibility of a renewed
international race to develop new kinds of nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   And the devaluing of nuclear secrets, highlighted by the rush of
atomic declassifications, was seen as a prerequisite to the ban's
achievement. The symbolism alone was potent, officials say.
Openness let them advertise a dramatic new state of affairs where
hidden actions were to be kept to a minimum, replacing decades of
secrecy and paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States must stand as leader,'' O'Leary told a
packed news conference in December 1993 upon starting the process.
``We are declassifying the largest amount of information in the
history of the department.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, say the former secrets are extremely valuable
to foreign powers intent on making nuclear headway. Gaffney, the
former Reagan official, disparaged the giveaway as ``dangling
goodies in front of people to get them to sign up into our
arms-control agenda.''

<P>
   Thomas B. Cochran, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources
Defense Council in Washington, a private group that has criticized
the openness, said the declassifications had swept away so many
secrets that the combination had laid bare the central mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the phenomenology of nuclear weapons,'' Cochran
said, ``the cat is out of the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the China scandal broke, experts outside the
administration faulted the openness as promoting the bomb's spread.
Last year, a bipartisan commission of nine military specialists led
by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the ``extensive
declassification'' of secrets had inadvertently aided the global
spread of deadly weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate brake on nuclear advances was to be the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which Clinton began to push for as
soon as he took office in 1993, hailing it as the hardest-fought,
longest-sought prize in the history of arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Like software, nuclear weapons are extraordinarily complex. New
designs must be tested repeatedly to get out the bugs and avoid
failures in war. Without explosive tests, experts say, reliable
designs of advanced arms are basically unattainable.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1996, Clinton traveled to the United Nations to
sign the newly negotiated accord on behalf of the United States,
followed by 151 other countries, including China. ``It was my
proudest moment,'' O'Leary, the former energy secretary, said of
watching the president.
</P>
<P>
   Today, key nations, including the United States, have yet to
ratify the accord. So it is in legal limbo.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the China espionage scandal, experts say, the ban is
both good and bad, making the blows softer in the short run and
perhaps harder in the long. Since the test ban helps smother
nuclear developments, any recent Chinese spying probably has had
little impact on arms production.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, secrets of the neutron bomb believed to have been
stolen around 1995 would have been little or no aid to China's test
program, which apparently ended in July 1996. The reason, experts
say, is that tests are enormous affairs of science and industry
that typically take two or three years to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charge that the administration's expectation that China
could do little with stolen information made it blase about
disclosures of espionage and slowed its response to lax security.
Selling China and other states on the test ban, said Gaffney of the
Center for Security Policy, had a higher administration priority
than plugging leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials deny any foot-dragging. But they note
that much of the thievery cited in the congressional report
occurred long before the test-ban treaty was signed and even before
Clinton took office; this, they say, absolves the administration of
some blame. But it gave the Chinese more time to have used
underground blasts to help turn stolen ideas into deadly arms.
</P>
<P>
   This opportunity for China applies especially to the most
worrisome part of the alleged espionage, the theft in the 1980s of
design secrets for America's most advanced warhead, the W-88. The
damage, officials concede, is probably already done, as China
apparently tested the warhead right before it signed the test-ban
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Today, experts worry about the extent to which American secrets,
lost by accident or design, can be joined with increasingly fast
computers to replace testing, so nuclear strides leave no telltale
rumbles.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, American weapon designers used very fast
computers to calculate how bombs explode, producing simulations
realistic enough to check the feasibility of new designs before
taking the costly step of testing them in blasts. Today computers
are only getting cheaper, faster and better.
</P>
<P>
   The House select committee on Chinese espionage, chaired by
Christopher Cox, R-Calif., sidestepped the issue of China's need
for testing, arguing that computers would suffice for advances. The
test ban, it said in its report, increased China's eagerness for
computers to simulate nuclear blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Ray E. Kidder, a senior physicist at the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory in California, one of the nation's
nuclear-weapons labs, said China could indeed use supercomputers in
lieu of testing to perfect and field a new weapon. ``But it would
have to be a conservative design,'' Kidder said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Total reliance on computers, he added, would virtually rule out
the development of advanced designs, where tiny changes can spell
the difference between success and failure.
</P>
<P>
   A long-term worry, experts say, is whether the test ban is now
masking major Chinese strides, making them less conspicuous and,
over time, perhaps more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bracken, a military expert at Yale, said the ultimate blow
would be a sudden move by China to break out of the test ban with a
barrage of violent blasts, intent on perfecting a new round of
nuclear arms and tipping the world's geopolitical balance.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of American secrets, he said, ``increases the chance
for technological surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials say such fears are unjustified. If the test ban
holds, they say, and if the openness gamble turns out to have paid
off because fewer nations are seeking to join a nuclear club whose
arsenals are frozen, then the Clinton administration will be
remembered as having had clear vision and courage after all.  &QL;

RETHINKING AMERICA'S SCHOOLS OF HARD KNOCKS

(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy was perplexed. Having grown up in a
California suburb in the 1950s, the Supreme Court justice objected
to the way his colleagues were calling what schoolboys do to
schoolgirls ``sexual harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   As he put it in his dissent in a key ruling last week, ``The
real world of school discipline is a rough-and-tumble place where
students practice newly learned vulgarities, erupt with anger,
tease and embarrass each other, share offensive notes, flirt, push
and shove in the halls, grab and offend.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Georgia boy whose behavior the court considered a
violation of federal law was not a tease. For months he had
taunted, propositioned and put his hands all over the girl seated
next to him. This was not 1950s flirting.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the case reflects how much has changed in the lives of
the young in recent decades. As the nation's school year draws to
an anxious close, with teachers and principals exhausted from worry
about safety and undetected rage, educators and psychologists say
they are re-examining adolescent behavior _ the moods, the cliques,
the barely repressed violence _ and finding that American society
has failed to come to terms with those changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that this is their world, `Lord of the Flies,'
sadistic and hierarchical, that it has always been that way and
they just have to work it out, doesn't fly anymore,'' said Dr. Gil
Noam, a professor of psychiatry and education at Harvard
University. ``Especially in the wake of what happened in Colorado,
we have to reassess that.''
</P>
<P>
   A few specialists accept the implication of Kennedy's dissent
from the Supreme Court's ruling last week that schools may be held
liable for a student's persistent sexual harassment of another.
Those experts say little has changed in the last half century,
except perhaps the way society views how men act toward women, and
it makes no sense to apply the law to teen-age hormones and
immaturity.
</P>
<P>
   Most, however, say a lot has changed, and the problem is that
adults do not grasp the significance of those changes. Youthful
behavior has deteriorated markedly, many say, guns are easily
available and there are far fewer adults around to influence
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, violent television and video images, instead of
older friends or relatives, have become role models. Moreover,
research on aggression suggests that even what some might consider
old-fashioned name-calling can do serious harm.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a 14-year-old New York girl hanged herself in a
high school restroom. Friends said she had suffered continual
verbal abuse by classmates. Psychologists note that such suicides
have been on the rise among the young in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started in this field, people really believed the old
saying about sticks and stones breaking bones but words never
harming,'' said Marla R. Brassard, a professor of psychology at
Teachers College at Columbia University whose research focuses on
aggression in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``But today there is a growing body of research that shows that
the core element of abuse is psychological,'' she said. ``Physical
aggression has no anti-social impact unless it is part of
psychological abuse. Getting picked on at school can be the most
damaging.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harold Koplewicz, director of the Child Study Center at New
York University, said researchers point to five challenges
adolescents must navigate by the time they reach about age 22: they
must adjust to bodily changes; separate psychologically from their
parents or guardians; develop a social network of friends to whom
they can talk; develop educational and vocational goals, and
establish their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Those are a lot of developmental tasks to face in the space of a
decade or less, he noted, and it is no surprise that adolescents
are moodier than younger children, or that high school can be a
very daunting place.
</P>
<P>
   He and others believe that those challenges have essentially
remained unchanged over the generations. Michael Gurian, a family
therapist from Spokane, Wash., and author of ``A Fine Young Man''
(Putnam, 1998), even believes male adolescent behavior is fairly
constant through all the primates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adolescence is a time for children to become adults, and part
of what they have to do is test each other,'' he said. ``Adults are
their teachers, but other youths are their testers. What we do in
junior high school and high school is normal primate behavior. We
have to do this stuff to each other. The question is, where do we
draw the line? For this generation, the lack of adult supervision
is a very big issue. Over the last 30 years we have gradually been
cutting out adult supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a widely held view of researchers. They point out that
the reduced supervision stems not only from both parents or single
parents working out of the home; it is also because relatives and
neighbors are away as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never in the history of the civilized world been a
cohort of kids that is so little affected by adult guidance and so
attuned to a peer world,'' said William Damon, a professor of
education and director of the Stanford University Center on
Adolescence. ``We have removed grown-up wisdom and allowed them to
drift into a self-constructed, highly relativistic world of
friendship and peers.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon said that he was stunned when he went to Littleton, Colo.,
after the high school shootings there last month, to find parents
saying they felt they had no business learning what their children
were doing on the Internet. The two students who carried out the
Littleton carnage had vented their hatred on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Damon said the fact that modern adults have a less
black-and-white view of morality and human behavior, that they have
perhaps a more nuanced perspective, seems to be blocking their
ability to give clear-cut guidance and make strict rules for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understanding can paralyze you,'' he said. ``Understanding the
roots of a boy's misbehavior should not stop you from dealing with
it strictly.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurian, the Spokane therapist, says ``Lord of the Flies,'' the
chilling 1954 William Golding novel about boys marooned on an
island without adults, is a useful model of unsupervised male
adolescent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pick on those they consider weak partly to establish a
pecking order and partly to protect the group against weakness,''
he said. ``It is natural for boys to do this and it is natural for
adults to supervise and stop this behavior. We are allowing too
much of the first piece and not enough of the second.''
</P>
<P>
   Something else is going on as well. The view of what is
appropriate male behavior is shifting.
</P>
<P>
   Jay P. Heubert, a professor of education at Columbia's Teachers
College, said he and his wife were watching an old James Bond movie
recently and noted that Bond, played by Sean Connery, grabbed a
nurse and tried to kiss her. When she resisted, he warned her that
he would tell her boss that she was not performing her job well.
</P>
<P>
   While by today's lights, there could hardly be a clearer example
of sexual harassment, there was no mention of it in the film.
Instead, Bond and the nurse are seen shortly thereafter in steamy
embrace and she becomes his companion for the rest of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our norms of what constitutes offensive behavior are
changing,'' Heubert said. ``This only adds to the difficulty of the
young understanding what is appropriate behavior and of their need
for adults to talk to.''

   Those are a lot of developmental tasks to face in the space of a
decade or less, he noted, and it is no surprise that adolescents
are moodier than younger children, or that high school can be a
very daunting place.
</P>
<P>
   He and others believe that those challenges have essentially
remained unchanged over the generations. Michael Gurian, a family
therapist from Spokane, Wash., and author of ``A Fine Young Man''
(Putnam, 1998), even believes male adolescent behavior is fairly
constant through all the primates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adolescence is a time for children to become adults, and part
of what they have to do is test each other,'' he said. ``Adults are
their teachers, but other youths are their testers. What we do in
junior high school and high school is normal primate behavior. We
have to do this stuff to each other. The question is, where do we
draw the line? For this generation, the lack of adult supervision
is a very big issue. Over the last 30 years we have gradually been
cutting out adult supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a widely held view of researchers. They point out that
the reduced supervision stems not only from both parents or single
parents working out of the home; it is also because relatives and
neighbors are away as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never in the history of the civilized world been a
cohort of kids that is so little affected by adult guidance and so
attuned to a peer world,'' said William Damon, a professor of
education and director of the Stanford University Center on
Adolescence. ``We have removed grown-up wisdom and allowed them to
drift into a self-constructed, highly relativistic world of
friendship and peers.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon said that he was stunned when he went to Littleton, Colo.,
after the high school shootings there last month, to find parents
saying they felt they had no business learning what their children
were doing on the Internet. The two students who carried out the
Littleton carnage had vented their hatred on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Damon said the fact that modern adults have a less
black-and-white view of morality and human behavior, that they have
perhaps a more nuanced perspective, seems to be blocking their
ability to give clear-cut guidance and make strict rules for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understanding can paralyze you,'' he said. ``Understanding the
roots of a boy's misbehavior should not stop you from dealing with
it strictly.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurian, the Spokane therapist, says ``Lord of the Flies,'' the
chilling 1954 William Golding novel about boys marooned on an
island without adults, is a useful model of unsupervised male
adolescent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pick on those they consider weak partly to establish a
pecking order and partly to protect the group against weakness,''
he said. ``It is natural for boys to do this and it is natural for
adults to supervise and stop this behavior. We are allowing too
much of the first piece and not enough of the second.''
</P>
<P>
   Something else is going on as well. The view of what is
appropriate male behavior is shifting.
</P>
<P>
   Jay P. Heubert, a professor of education at Columbia's Teachers
College, said he and his wife were watching an old James Bond movie
recently and noted that Bond, played by Sean Connery, grabbed a
nurse and tried to kiss her. When she resisted, he warned her that
he would tell her boss that she was not performing her job well.
</P>
<P>
   While by today's lights, there could hardly be a clearer example
of sexual harassment, there was no mention of it in the film.
Instead, Bond and the nurse are seen shortly thereafter in steamy
embrace and she becomes his companion for the rest of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our norms of what constitutes offensive behavior are
changing,'' Heubert said. ``This only adds to the difficulty of the
young understanding what is appropriate behavior and of their need
for adults to talk to.''

RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS: A SECOND LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Second Amendment, the orphan of the Bill of Rights, has been
written off as a legal backwater for decades. Judges and legal
scholars have glossed over its guarantee of the right ``to keep and
bear arms'' as if it were so much propaganda for the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   But now, just as gun control is gaining momentum, the provision
one legal scholar calls ``the embarrassing Second Amendment'' is
being taken seriously for the first time in modern memory, with
some scholars and at least one federal judge saying it may
guarantee individual citizens some rights to guns, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Here, for example, is a comment made by one prominent
constitutional expert in an interview last week: ``It becomes
impossible to deny that some right to bear arms is among the rights
of American citizens.'' Charlton Heston? No. It was Laurence Tribe,
the influential liberal constitutional law expert at Harvard Law
School who personally favors gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because there are so many guns already in circulation,
most people, polls show, have always believed the Amendment gives
individuals a right to firearms. But for some 60 years courts have
ruled that the Amendment merely guarantees a collective right to
arms _ by state militias, for example _ and extends no such right
to individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Now some mainstream legal scholars, including some liberals, say
a new expansive interpretation has persuaded them that the Second
Amendment may have to be pulled out of the courthouse dustbin. In
something of a nightmare for gun-control advocates, a conservative
federal judge in Lubbock, Texas, tried to do just that last month.
Contrary to all modern legal precedents, the judge, Sam R.
Cummings, said the Amendment gives individuals some rights to
weapons. He cited new assertions in recent years that the
Amendment's history shows it was intended to guarantee individuals
such rights.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional experts say it is too early to tell if the Second
Amendment will gain real force. But if an individual's right were
established under the Second Amendment, courts would have to weigh
any gun-control legislation that limits ownership by individuals to
determine whether it meets some reasonable governmental purpose.
</P>
<P>
   These experts say the Texas case could well go to the Supreme
Court. Two justices, Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia, have
indicated that they are sympathetic to the expanded definition of
the Second Amendment. But it is unclear whether other justices
would agree.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Texas case doesn't get past the federal appeals
court where it is now headed in New Orleans, Cummings' ruling shows
that the new interpretation of the Second Amendment has given gun
advocates rhetorical strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain surface plausibility to interpreting the
Second Amendment as protecting a right to private gun ownership,''
said Michael C. Dorf, a professor of constitutional law at Columbia
Law School who favors gun control. ``When you dig beneath the
surface, you can refute that interpretation but it would be better
if we didn't have to engage in that argument at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said for several years that the reinterpretation of
the Second Amendment is partisan work by scholars supported by the
NRA. In a 1995 article in The New York Review of Books, Garry Wills
attacked the new scholarship as a simple-minded mixture of ``humbug
with history.''
</P>
<P>
   But some constitutional law experts say the recent scholarship
proves that the Second Amendment gives citizens a right to weapons.
``There was never even a suggestion that it would be appropriate
for the national government to deny gun ownership to a private
person,'' said William Van Alstyne, a constitutional law professor
at Duke University and a gun owner who said he has been examining
the Amendment more closely in recent years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new scholarship began in the 1980s, when scholars started to
challenge the prevailing view of the Amendment. They poked through
history and found what they said was clear evidence that the
drafters meant to give individuals the right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   One source they cited was the British Bill of Rights of 1689,
which they said was a model for the Second Amendment. The British
Bill said, ``The subjects which are Protestants may have arms for
their defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law.''
This and other texts, they said, showed that the Second Amendment
was meant to protect private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The new thinking spread beyond the margins of academia. A
respected constitutional expert at the University of Texas, Sanford
Levinson, argued in an influential 1989 Yale Law Journal article,
``The Embarrassing Second Amendment,'' that the liberal legal
establishment had ignored the provision because it could be a
barrier to gun control. Such a cold shoulder would never be
offered, he said, to Bill of Rights provisions that intellectuals
found less embarrassing, like the fashionable First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates have worked hard to undermine the new
analysis. The Amendment deserved to atrophy, they say, because it
is more like the outdated Third Amendment, which prohibits the
quartering of troops in peacetime, than the First Amendment, with
its modern-sounding free-speech guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars supporting gun control have also mined history for
nuggets they say prove the Amendment was limited to collective arms
possession. In a law review article last year, Carl T. Bogus, a law
professor at Roger Williams University in Bristol, R.I., argued
that James Madison included the Second Amendment merely to win
support for the Bill of Rights from Southerners who wanted armed
units to control slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these scholars agree that the language of the British
Bill of Rights was reflected in the Second Amendment a century
later. But the British Bill's language permitting gun ownership
``as allowed by law,'' they say, was really a form of gun control
because there had long been curbs on owning weapons. The purpose of
the measure, they say, was to make it clear after the reign of the
Catholic King James II that Parliament, not the monarch, would
decide who would have what weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth is probably just beginning. But it is clear
the argument over the Second Amendment has become much more serious
than it was only a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tribe said he had re-examined the issue because of the recent
burst of scholarship. His study of the Amendment's language and
historical context, he said, caused him to believe that the
provision had been cast aside too easily.
</P>
<P>
   But even if there is some individual right to arms, Tribe said,
he is persuaded that most existing and proposed gun-control
measures would probably be constitutional anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he expects legal experts to be startled when they learn
that a new edition of his influential treatise, ``American
Constitutional Law,'' to be published this summer, will for the
first time include an extensive section suggesting that the
prevailing view of the Second Amendment as guaranteeing only
collective rights to weapons may have been simplistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who are coming to the conclusion that the
Second Amendment is not just limited to the states are themselves
quite liberal,'' Tribe said. `It's not just the `hired guns for the
NRA.'''

DRIVING GUN CONTROL: IT'S ABOUT THE ELECTIONS, STUPID 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It did not happen after the bullets flew and the
bodies fell at a high school in West Paducah, Ky., in December
1997, nor did it happen on the heels of the gunfire and bloodshed
at schools in Jonesboro, Ark., or Springfield, Ore., last year.
</P>
<P>
   But after Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., became a
deadly shooting gallery on April 20, the earth finally moved, at
least politically speaking, in subtle but undeniable ways.
</P>
<P>
   States dusted off languishing gun-control laws. The Senate
approved its own measures, incremental but significant. And last
week Republican leaders in the House, where gun control has
traditionally been a harder sell than in the Senate, signaled that
they would probably follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to chalk up this change to the statistical fact
that the body count at Columbine, where 15 people died, was triple
the toll at any of the other schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the legislative action was the result of a confluence of
factors, from the enormously high stakes of next year's
presidential and congressional elections to the location of the
violence, and from the vulnerability of the National Rifle
Association to the growing discomfort of some Republicans with the
most conservative faction of their party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, undoubtedly, a fortuitous moment for pro-gun control
forces,'' said Robert J. Spitzer, a political science professor at
the State University of New York, who wrote ``The Politics of Gun
Control'' (Chatham House, 1995).
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, other political analysts and several politicians
stressed that the gun-control legislation being passed now had been
years in the making.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue came to a head after Littleton for a number of
particular, special reasons, politicians and gun-control experts
said. One was the looming elections of 2000, when the White House
will be up for grabs and control of the House of Representatives,
where the Republican majority is slim, could go to either party.
</P>
<P>
   Those stakes have left both Republicans and Democrats nervous
about falling on the wrong side of any volatile issue or conceding
any potentially popular cause to their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who helped plot her
party's gun-control strategy on the Senate floor, said Republicans
in the Senate might have beat back Democrats' efforts and tried to
stifle the whole debate at a less fraught moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they knew the outrage over this would have been
deafening had they not allowed this _ and that there would have
been political consequences,'' Boxer said, referring to the debate
on the Senate floor, where Democrats outmaneuvered Republicans and
lured a number of moderates over to their viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Edwards, a former Republican congressman from Oklahoma
who now teaches at Harvard University's Kennedy School of
government, said another political factor came into play as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impeachment drive _ and the failure of it _ somewhat
weakened the really hard-line conservatives in the Republican Party
and strengthened the moderates,'' said Edwards, noting that a fair
number of Republicans broke ranks in the Senate and that House
Speaker Dennis Hastert has called for some gun-control measures.
``The hard-core conservatives overreached one time too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Littleton, more than the locations of other school shootings,
was precisely the kind of archetypal suburban setting that both
parties have cast as pivotal political battlegrounds. So
Republicans and Democrats alike were particularly eager to show
such constituents that they cared.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who heads the
Senate Republican Campaign Committee, noted that the gun-control
measures that passed the Senate benefited from an additional, less
politically loaded factor.
</P>
<P>
   As the aftershocks of Littleton rumbled across America, it just
so happened that there was a Senate bill that addressed the
prevention and punishment of juvenile crime. It had been
percolating in a committee for years and was overdue in coming to
the floor of the chamber. The bill became an appropriate vehicle
for gun control, so when Senate Democrats pressed for a gun-control
debate, it was hard for Republicans to resist them.
</P>
<P>
   There was, of course, yet another player in these events: the
National Rifle Association. Although it had been a potent foe of
new restrictions on firearms, the call for such regulations after
Littleton hit the group at a moment of relative frailty. Membership
was down from the early 1990s; ties between the rifle association
and the militia movement had battered its image.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA was also wounded by an astonishing quirk of scheduling.
As Osha Gray Davidson, author of ``Under Fire: the NRA and the
Battle for Gun Control'' (Henry Holt, 1993), said, ``The fact that
the NRA's annual meeting was planned for the week after the
shooting in virtually the same place guaranteed that they would get
extra media scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the final ingredient in the recipe for legislative
action was the banality of the motives of the teen-age boys who
opened fire in Littleton, at least as those reasons were initially
reported in the news media. These children were outsiders hurt by
their exclusion from cliques, and guns gave them their revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``When students who come from what appear to be affluent, normal
families suddenly go berserk,'' said Bob Walker, president of the
advocacy group Handgun Control Inc., ``people begin to recognize
that it could happen anywhere.''

where the Republican majority is slim, could go to either party.
</P>
<P>
   Those stakes have left both Republicans and Democrats nervous
about falling on the wrong side of any volatile issue or conceding
any potentially popular cause to their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who helped plot her
party's gun-control strategy on the Senate floor, said Republicans
in the Senate might have beat back Democrats' efforts and tried to
stifle the whole debate at a less fraught moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they knew the outrage over this would have been
deafening had they not allowed this _ and that there would have
been political consequences,'' Boxer said, referring to the debate
on the Senate floor, where Democrats outmaneuvered Republicans and
lured a number of moderates over to their viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Edwards, a former Republican congressman from Oklahoma
who now teaches at Harvard University's Kennedy School of
government, said another political factor came into play as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impeachment drive _ and the failure of it _ somewhat
weakened the really hard-line conservatives in the Republican Party
and strengthened the moderates,'' said Edwards, noting that a fair
number of Republicans broke ranks in the Senate and that House
Speaker Dennis Hastert has called for some gun-control measures.
``The hard-core conservatives overreached one time too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Littleton, more than the locations of other school shootings,
was precisely the kind of archetypal suburban setting that both
parties have cast as pivotal political battlegrounds. So
Republicans and Democrats alike were particularly eager to show
such constituents that they cared.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who heads the
Senate Republican Campaign Committee, noted that the gun-control
measures that passed the Senate benefited from an additional, less
politically loaded factor.
</P>
<P>
   As the aftershocks of Littleton rumbled across America, it just
so happened that there was a Senate bill that addressed the
prevention and punishment of juvenile crime. It had been
percolating in a committee for years and was overdue in coming to
the floor of the chamber. The bill became an appropriate vehicle
for gun control, so when Senate Democrats pressed for a gun-control
debate, it was hard for Republicans to resist them.
</P>
<P>
   There was, of course, yet another player in these events: the
National Rifle Association. Although it had been a potent foe of
new restrictions on firearms, the call for such regulations after
Littleton hit the group at a moment of relative frailty. Membership
was down from the early 1990s; ties between the rifle association
and the militia movement had battered its image.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA was also wounded by an astonishing quirk of scheduling.
As Osha Gray Davidson, author of ``Under Fire: the NRA and the
Battle for Gun Control'' (Henry Holt, 1993), said, ``The fact that
the NRA's annual meeting was planned for the week after the
shooting in virtually the same place guaranteed that they would get
extra media scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the final ingredient in the recipe for legislative
action was the banality of the motives of the teen-age boys who
opened fire in Littleton, at least as those reasons were initially
reported in the news media. These children were outsiders hurt by
their exclusion from cliques, and guns gave them their revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``When students who come from what appear to be affluent, normal
families suddenly go berserk,'' said Bob Walker, president of the
advocacy group Handgun Control Inc., ``people begin to recognize
that it could happen anywhere.''

   NEW YORK _ A good trial lawyer spins a story from threads of
fact and possibility, and Marvyn Kornberg made his best effort. In
defense of the police officer charged with brutalizing the Haitian
immigrant Abner Louima, Kornberg promised the jury evidence that
the injuries to Louima's rectum and bladder could have happened
during consensual sex.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in his opening statement Kornberg said three experts
would testify that the injuries were not consistent with an
assault. He added that a sample of Louima's feces collected from
the station house ``contains the DNA of another male.''
</P>
<P>
   The finer lines of this story will never be known; last week the
officer, Justin Volpe, aborted his defense, pleaded guilty to
violating Louima's civil rights, and gave his own account of
ramming a stick into Louima's rectum in a fit of rage. After his
opening argument, Kornberg never mentioned the possibility of a
homosexual encounter, even during four hours of cross-examination
of Louima.
</P>
<P>
   After his client pleaded guilty, Kornberg said he owed Louima no
apology, because he had never directly said that Louima was injured
by consensual sex.
</P>
<P>
   But Kornberg's initial strategy kept provoking. The Rev. Al
Sharpton protested that it had amounted to ``a second rape.'' And
plenty of others asked: How can lawyers suggest these things? The
answer, Kornberg said in an interview, is that ``it's an
obligation: The defense counsel must do everything in his power to
defend the client.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers say that obligation includes suggesting almost
any scenario that can sow enough doubt to spring the client, as
long as the lawyer does not produce testimony he knows is false.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of that, there's a whole lot that can be done to
challenge the prosecution's case, and that often includes
distorting the prosecution's case,'' said Abbe Smith, the associate
director of the criminal justice clinic at the Georgetown Law
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence in support of the theory might be quite scant,''
said Ms. Smith, a former public defender. ``But I would embrace it
and argue it passionately, whether I believed it or not. Would I
feel good about it in the morning? It's not fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy, of course, to know what is false. As to where to
draw the line, ``People in the profession are split on this,'' said
David Rudovsky, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. ``It
crosses the line if you don't have the scientific or medical
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg did plan to present a forensic pathologist and two
colorectal surgeons as expert witnesses, according to a letter
filed with the court. And legal experts pointed out that his
contention _ that Louima's injuries were, as he said in his
opening, ``not, I repeat, not consistent with a nonconsensual
insertion of an object into his rectum'' _ avoided any direct
assertion.
</P>
<P>
   But Rudovsky said Kornberg raised a damning tactical problem for
himself. ``I think it's a crazy theory anyway,'' he said of
Kornberg's gay-sex scenario. ``It was going to be rejected. But
aside from that, one of the first rules of trial advocacy is,
`Don't promise too much.' What I can't imagine is a lawyer making
that claim and not having some proof, because in the end you get
the most devastating statement from the prosecutor: `Where's this
pathologist?'''
</P>
<P>
   Smearing the victim with sexual innuendo, a favored approach in
rape cases, is always a high-risk tactic. ``This isn't a claim that
the umbrella couldn't have opened a certain way,'' Rudovsky said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a risk taken by Alton Maddox in defending Steven Bowman,
one of the men accused of slashing Marla Hanson, the model, on a
Manhattan street 13 years ago. The lawyer said Ms. Hanson, who did
not know her attackers, had ``racial hangups,'' and he badgered her
on cross-examination with questions and innuendo about her sex
life. ``My job,'' Maddox said later, ``is to walk Bowman out of
this courthouse.'' (In the end, he did not.)
</P>
<P>
   The same outrage was directed at Jack T. Litman, the attorney
for Robert Chambers, who killed 18-year-old Jennifer Levin during a
sexual encounter in Central Park. Pursuing Chambers' claim that he
struck Miss Levin when she hurt him during ``rough sex,'' Litman
sought to introduce the girl's diary, which he called ``a
chronicle'' of her ``kinky and aggressive'' sex life.
</P>
<P>
   If rapists are hard to defend, Ms. Smith said, police officers
can be even harder. ``Defense lawyers are easy targets, and
Kornberg is an especially easy target because folks who consider
themselves civil libertarians are less comfortable when it's a
police officer engaged in the level of horrible conduct,'' she
said. ``These are the cases that cause my parents' friends to ask
how I could defend those people.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond public outrage, the doubly humiliated victim or witness
has no recourse for statements made in a courtroom. However
fantastic and damaging, they are privileged. But lawyers can be
made to pay for what they say on the courthouse steps.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Pagones, a former prosecutor, sued the advisers of Tawana
Brawley after they accused him of abducting and raping the
teenager. He charged that the advisers _ including Sharpton and
Maddox _ had made repeated and baseless accusations outside court.
Last year, after a trial in state Supreme Court in Poughkeepsie,
they were found liable and ordered to pay Pagones $345,000.

<P>
   NATO's bombing campaign in Yugoslavia has exposed more than
policy differences between the European and American alliance
partners. As never before, it has revealed the vast technological
gulf that separates American military capabilities from those of
Britain, France and the others. And that, in turn, shows how much
the Europeans remain militarily dependent on the United States for
their own defense _ dependent, and resentful.
</P>
<P>
   For Europe these days, the word ``defense'' means the ability to
deal with problems like Kosovo on their own continent. But that,
more and more, means the ability to bring technology to bear. And
since the Americans have most of the technology, the Americans call
most of the shots on strategy and tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Take the way the air war has developed.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, all the allies hoped a ground war would be
unnecessary. But nobody except the United States had enough
sophisticated F-14, F-15, F-16 and F-18 fighters and
fighter-bombers to launch the kind of campaign that might avoid a
ground war.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody but the United States had the ``stealth'' F-117
fighters and B-2 bombers whose strange shapes and composite
materials make it hard for Yugoslavia's sophisticated air defenses
to shoot them down.
</P>
<P>
   So the allies agreed on an air war but had to accept American
ideas about how it should be fought.
</P>
<P>
   The primary American concern was to minimize allied losses, and
the allied losses have been negligible. But the bombing campaign
has not prevented continued ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, and now
this is widening fissures that were probably there from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Consider one reason the B-2s fly their missions all the way from
Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri: The United States does not
want even most of its European friends to get a close look at the
planes.
</P>
<P>
   And among all its allies, the United States has judged only
Britain trustworthy enough to acquire any of the satellite-guided
American-developed Tomahawk cruise missiles, which can carry out
precision attacks from ships hundreds of miles away. Even the
British got only 65, while the United States has hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Having to deal with Kosovo the American way, with bombing
instead of ground troops, had advantages for the Europeans, but
also drawbacks. The longer the bombing drags on inconclusively, the
greater the frustration and resentment in both Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as some military thinkers are beginning to say a ground
campaign may become necessary before autumn, all that the allies
have been able to agree on is a plan to put 50,000 troops in Kosovo
as peacekeepers if Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic,
finally backs down and lets international troops escort Kosovo's
refugees back home.
</P>
<P>
   But even that plan, calling for perhaps 7,000 American ground
troops, would not dull the edge that technology gives the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   If tens of thousands of fresh troops must be flown in quickly as
peacekeepers, only the United States has enough giant C-5, C-141
and C-17 air transports to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   And if the allies decide this summer that air power alone is not
enough to make Milosevic back down _ which might or might not be
more likely now that he has been indicted as a war criminal by the
international tribunal in The Hague _ only the United States could
quickly fly in or provide the 100,000 or more troops required to
drive Yugoslav forces out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's ability to move around huge numbers of troops is
``deplorably slow,'' in the words of NATO's recently retired senior
military officer, Gen. Klaus Naumann of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the United States continues to dominate the skies over
Kosovo, with up to 815 aircraft (including Apache anti-tank
helicopters still waiting for combat and KC-135 refueling planes).
All 18 other allies together provide 277, with more than half of
those coming from France (102 Mirage, Jaguar, Super-Etendards and
other planes), and Britain (38 Harrier GR-7 and Tornado GR-1
fighter-bombers and support aircraft).
</P>
<P>
   One result is that Europeans are talking again, as they have
been doing for years, about a need to fix the imbalance.
</P>
<P>
   And as flaws in the American air-war strategy emerge, some
Europeans are blaming its failures on the Clinton administration's
reluctance to expose air crews to danger. Most allied pilots fly
only above 15,000 feet, beyond the reach of conventional Yugoslav
anti-aircraft artillery. But they are far less effective against
Serbian armor than they would be if they flew lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Military pilots are paid to risk their lives, and most of ours
feel frustrated a lot of the time,'' a French official said. ``But
the United States has a zero-deaths policy, and the United States
is running the show.''
</P>
<P>
   A reluctance to take casualties is only one factor. The
availability of an alternative is another. As Naumann pointed out,
most European countries lack the Americans' ability to launch
laser- and satellite-guided bombs at a safe distance from ground
fire. ``Most European planes,'' he said, ``have to fly more or less
over the targets, which is the most stupid thing you can do, since
you expose yourself to the enemy air defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain and France agreed late last year that one lesson of
previous wars in the Balkans was that Europe needed to build up
autonomous defense capabilities within the alliance. The day would
come, the French argued, when the United States might tire of
entanglements and the Europeans would have to act alone.
Paradoxically, it is American involvement in Kosovo, rather than
withdrawal, that has revived the issue now.
</P>
<P>
   But in order to achieve real change, Europeans would have to
spend billions of dollars to catch up with the technological
revolution that the American military achieved in the 1970s and
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Naumann said, spends $36 billion a year on
defense research and development, while all the European allies and
Canada together have been spending only $10 billion. Last year,
according to NATO figures, the United States spent the equivalent
of 3.2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense, 27 percent
of it on equipment and infrastructure; the European allies averaged
2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't want a European military organization that can get
along without the Americans and reduce military budgets,'' a
retired French general, Pierre Gallois, said. And the United States
is increasing military spending, while the Europeans are
continually cutting back.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spending, they vow at NATO summit meetings like the
one in Washington in April to build a stronger European security
and defense identity within the alliance. They will probably make
another one at a summit meeting of the European Union in Cologne at
the end of this week, now that NATO has agreed to let European
countries use NATO facilities for future operations that the United
States doesn't join.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Naumann commented, these arrangements exist only on
paper. ``What we now need to see are deeds, and it is urgent that
something is done,'' he said. Kosovo might finally make the allies
actually do something.  &QL;

peacekeepers, only the United States has enough giant C-5, C-141
and C-17 air transports to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   And if the allies decide this summer that air power alone is not
enough to make Milosevic back down _ which might or might not be
more likely now that he has been indicted as a war criminal by the
international tribunal in The Hague _ only the United States could
quickly fly in or provide the 100,000 or more troops required to
drive Yugoslav forces out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's ability to move around huge numbers of troops is
``deplorably slow,'' in the words of NATO's recently retired senior
military officer, Gen. Klaus Naumann of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the United States continues to dominate the skies over
Kosovo, with up to 815 aircraft (including Apache anti-tank
helicopters still waiting for combat and KC-135 refueling planes).
All 18 other allies together provide 277, with more than half of
those coming from France (102 Mirage, Jaguar, Super-Etendards and
other planes), and Britain (38 Harrier GR-7 and Tornado GR-1
fighter-bombers and support aircraft).
</P>
<P>
   One result is that Europeans are talking again, as they have
been doing for years, about a need to fix the imbalance.
</P>
<P>
   And as flaws in the American air-war strategy emerge, some
Europeans are blaming its failures on the Clinton administration's
reluctance to expose air crews to danger. Most allied pilots fly
only above 15,000 feet, beyond the reach of conventional Yugoslav
anti-aircraft artillery. But they are far less effective against
Serbian armor than they would be if they flew lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Military pilots are paid to risk their lives, and most of ours
feel frustrated a lot of the time,'' a French official said. ``But
the United States has a zero-deaths policy, and the United States
is running the show.''
</P>
<P>
   A reluctance to take casualties is only one factor. The
availability of an alternative is another. As Naumann pointed out,
most European countries lack the Americans' ability to launch
laser- and satellite-guided bombs at a safe distance from ground
fire. ``Most European planes,'' he said, ``have to fly more or less
over the targets, which is the most stupid thing you can do, since
you expose yourself to the enemy air defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain and France agreed late last year that one lesson of
previous wars in the Balkans was that Europe needed to build up
autonomous defense capabilities within the alliance. The day would
come, the French argued, when the United States might tire of
entanglements and the Europeans would have to act alone.
Paradoxically, it is American involvement in Kosovo, rather than
withdrawal, that has revived the issue now.
</P>
<P>
   But in order to achieve real change, Europeans would have to
spend billions of dollars to catch up with the technological
revolution that the American military achieved in the 1970s and
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Naumann said, spends $36 billion a year on
defense research and development, while all the European allies and
Canada together have been spending only $10 billion. Last year,
according to NATO figures, the United States spent the equivalent
of 3.2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense, 27 percent
of it on equipment and infrastructure; the European allies averaged
2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't want a European military organization that can get
along without the Americans and reduce military budgets,'' a
retired French general, Pierre Gallois, said. And the United States
is increasing military spending, while the Europeans are
continually cutting back.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spending, they vow at NATO summit meetings like the
one in Washington in April to build a stronger European security
and defense identity within the alliance. They will probably make
another one at a summit meeting of the European Union in Cologne at
the end of this week, now that NATO has agreed to let European
countries use NATO facilities for future operations that the United
States doesn't join.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Naumann commented, these arrangements exist only on
paper. ``What we now need to see are deeds, and it is urgent that
something is done,'' he said. Kosovo might finally make the allies
actually do something.  &QL;

GROUND WARS MAKE STRANGE BEDFELLOWS

   Is Kosovo a liberal cause? A conservative one?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's hard to tell. As the question of sending in
ground troops becomes more and more pressing, many seasoned
anti-war liberal intellectuals like Susan Sontag and Democratic
lawmakers like Sen. Tom Harkin have pushed to send in the soldiers.
And right by their side are conservative stalwarts like William
Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard; Republican Sen. John
McCain, and Jeane Kirkpatrick, the former U.N. delegate during the
Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, other conservatives like Pat Buchanan and
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott say the United States should stay
out. ``Give peace a chance,'' said Lott _ sounding remarkably like
former President Jimmy Carter and Tom Hayden, the former leader of
the Students for a Democratic Society who is now a California state
senator.
</P>
<P>
   Politics, of course, has produced more strange bedfellows than
``The Dating Game.'' Yet something else seems to be going on here.
These odd alliances may signal a stumbling, but significant,
intellectual and political shift that could have far-reaching
effects for American foreign policy. The unlikely agreements
between bitter ideological enemies are evidence of how much the
definition of America's role in the world is changing.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, opposing the military was a reflex for leftists.
Whether a skirmish in Grenada or a full-scale war in Vietnam, such
battles only helped to strengthen the military and fuel the nuclear
conflict with the Soviet Union. To them, the idea that the United
States had a special responsibility was simply a euphemism for
American imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, those are precisely the kinds of arguments that liberals
who oppose the war in Kosovo continue to make. ``Bombs couldn't
bring peace in Vietnam,'' Hayden wrote in a letter to President
Clinton last month. Hayden also warned against a ``new
imperialism,'' and getting stuck in a ``quagmire.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent editorial in The Nation anguished over the dilemma
faced by the ``principled anti-militarist.'' Still, the editorial
demanded that the administration ``Stop the war now,'' citing
violations of law, the disquieting notion of America as the world's
policeman and the bombing's contribution to the Kosovars'
suffering. Even the human rights president, Carter, opposes using
military force to prevent ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But many liberals reject such arguments. The first cracks in the
antiwar tradition appeared at the end of the Cold War. Suddenly the
definition of the national interest was up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnian war in the early 1990s, with its haunting images of
skeletal figures behind barbed wire, forced deportations and mass
killings, helped push more liberals out of the anti-war camp. Never
again, declared a growing number of intellectuals, particularly
Jewish ones.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this period, prominent liberals like David Rieff, Ms.
Sontag's son, published wrenching accounts from Bosnia. Other
liberals, like Leon Wieseltier, who wrote a string of editorials in
The New Republic, urged a reluctant Bush administration, and then
the Clinton administration, to act.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the chilling effect caused by the death of 18 Army
Rangers in Somalia in 1993, humanitarian military missions gained
respect among liberals. By 1995, when the Serbs massacred thousands
of civilians in the Bosnian town of Srebenica while a U.N.
peacekeeping force stood by, many liberal peaceniks had hatched
into hawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The automatic `no''' has evaporated, said Todd Gitlin, who led
anti-war sit-ins in the 1960s and now teaches at New York
University. ``I think it is a sea change. Just wars are not only
possible, but legion.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, what enabled some doves to embrace war _ splitting
off narrow national interests from universal principles of human
rights _ is precisely what made it unappealing to many
conservatives. Buchanan has said: ``Americans sense that, despite
our disgust at the latest massacre and Milosevic's thuggery, no
vital U.S. interest exists there. The Serbs do not threaten NATO;
they have not attacked Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Those very reasons are the ones approvingly cited by Vaclav
Havel, the former dissident and current president of the Czech
Republic, in a recent speech supporting NATO's involvement in the
``first humanitarian war.''

   If the end of the Cold War freed the left from the automatic no,
it also freed the right from the automatic yes. No longer were
conservatives compelled to see every battle as a test of America's
anti-communist resolve. And while many on the right had previously
invoked human rights to criticize regimes in China and the Soviet
Union, the issue was less powerful when containing Communism was no
longer the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger has argued in Newsweek's international edition that
now that the United States and NATO are in Kosovo, they must win _
even if it means ground troops _ because maintaining credibility
trumps every other consideration. But he noted that in the past he
had ``passionately rejected'' sending soldiers to Kosovo, and added
that it was ``absurd'' to think global equilibrium or prosperity
depends on the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   For conservatives who want to send ground troops to Kosovo,
intervening to protect human rights has grown into a legitimate
foreign policy goal.
</P>
<P>
   Kristol said in an interview that American troops should have
been sent to Rwanda in 1994 to stop the Hutu massacre of an
estimated 500,000 Tutsis in a 100-day period _ even though the
United States had no vital interests there. As for Kosovo, Kristol
sees his support of ground troops as an extension of what he
characterizes as former President Ronald Reagan's vision of
America's unique moral mission in world affairs: The United States
should stand up to Serbia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, just as
it stood up to the ``Evil Empire.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other conservatives as well as liberals, Kristol is joining
human rights and Realpolitik interests in a search for common
ground. In Kosovo, Kristol said, ``the moral and strategic
interests of the United States really coincided.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Hoffmann, a liberal professor of European studies at
Harvard University, made a similar case in a recent issue of The
New York Review of Books. ``To tolerate this ferocious combination
of ethnic cleansing and quasi-genocide'' is to `` invite world
disorder on a grand scale,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   True, skeptics could ask whether establishing order is just an
excuse for waging a humanitarian war or whether the appeal to human
rights is simply a way to sell the abstract goal of stability to a
doubtful public. Yet either way, the Kosovo campaign is sharpening
the debate over when force is justified.
</P>
<P>
   McCain would like to see ``a 21st-century policy interpretation
of the Reagan Doctrine,'' which he calls a ``rogue state
rollback.'' In his view, the military should only be called in when
``our strategic interests and our political values'' are both
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Wieseltier, who also says both strategic interests and moral
imperatives require action in Kosovo, put it a different way: ``If
the United States is unwilling to put any one of its soldiers in
harm's way, then the United States is not a superpower.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously this debate won't be settled soon. Still, Kristol
noted how few could have predicted that ``this obscure little part
of the world turns out to crystallize what America's role in the
world should be.''

THE ART OF FINISHING UNFINISHED ART  
 (EDITORS: NOTE SLUG CHANGE; ORIGINALLY SKEDDED AS
SYMPHONIES-REVIEW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By JENNY LYN BADER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine being Franz Xaver Suessmayr. Your teacher, Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart, is dying, just as he's writing one of his greatest
works. On his deathbed he explains how he envisions completing it.
The rest is up to you.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Suessmayr. No one can say which parts of the ``Requiem'' he
had to make up, but he never wrote anything particularly good after
that. Others would later clean up his orchestrations and create new
versions based on newly unearthed sketches. Listening to the
``Requiem'' with all this in mind gives a whole new meaning to the
concert series title ``Mostly Mozart.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing the unfinished artworks of the dead has always been a
tricky business, but it can be a marketable enterprise, as recent
events confirm.
</P>
<P>
   When Ralph Ellison died five years ago, he left no instructions
concerning his 2,000-page draft for a sprawling epic. But it was
trimmed by the scholar John F. Callahan into a 384-page novel,
``Juneteenth,'' and published amid great publicity last week. And
Ernest Hemingway's unfinished ``True at First Light'' was cut from
850 pages to 320 by his son Patrick for publication this July in
time for the writer's 100th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Dead artists tend to have more clout than living ones these
days. After all, thanks to the peculiarities of restoration and
rediscovery, the big art premiere last week was for Leonardo da
Vinci (his newly restored ``Last Supper,'' in Milan, Italy), and at
the Tony awards next Sunday, the late Tennessee Williams could win
in the ``Best New Play'' category (for his newly produced ``Not
About Nightingales'').
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? In an age of cultural recycling, the fine art of
finishing could become a cottage industry.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone shares the same definition of
``finished.'' When Stanley Kubrick died in March, having just made
the final cut of ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' rumors flew that Warner Bros.
might do a little more editing to ensure the movie an ``R'' rating.
Tom Cruise came forward and vowed to fight any alterations.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders what would have happened if Cruise had been friends
with Edith Wharton. Could he have have used his influence to see to
it that her unfinished novel ``The Buccaneers'' would stay
untouched by contemporary completers?
</P>
<P>
   In defense of those who can't leave well enough alone, finishing
a work can bring it to a wider audience. If Marion Mainwaring had
not finished ``The Buccaneers,'' fewer readers would have
encountered this work of Wharton's _ and even fewer would have
tuned in to watch it on TV.
</P>
<P>
   And utterly no one would have seen the unproduced final drama of
Frances Sheridan, an 18th-century novelist, if a contemporary
writer hadn't added an ending 233 years after her death. The
resulting play, ``The Whisperers,'' with three acts by Sheridan and
two more in Restoration language by Elizabeth Kuti, premiered in
Ireland this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Collaborating with the dead creates special challenges. It means
seeing every note on a napkin as a little ``how-to'' manual,
ignoring unhelpful instructions like, ``Burn this if you find it,''
and wildly guessing what the artist would have wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Designers in Barcelona have been guessing since 1926 how to
finish the Sagrada Familia church in the spirit that the architect
Gaudi intended _ though no one can agree whether that spirit means
building it as originally specified, updating it or leaving it
magnificently half-built.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dickens left a half-written murder mystery without a
killer. In the ingenious musical adaptation of ``The Mystery of
Edwin Drood'' in the 1980s, the audience chose the murderer by
voting. Different endings were performed each night.
</P>
<P>
   While Dickens might be as startled to discover the Broadway
version of his detective novel as Victor Hugo would be to see a
touring company of ``Les Miz,'' the show's creators did demonstrate
a certain respect for Dickens by leaving the story unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   And audiences don't mind a little open-endedness. They will
happily vote on an ending. They will turn out to see performances
of Bach's unfinished ``The Art of the Fugue'' that stop where Bach
did. They will read ``The Last Tycoon'' though F. Scott Fitzgerald
didn't finish it.
</P>
<P>
   But in cases where the artist is the art, audiences may need a
little closure. When Jean Harlow died in 1937 during the filming of
``Saratoga,'' her fans wanted the movie released, so her remaining
scenes were shot with Mary Dees, who stood as far from the camera
as possible in a wide-brimmed hat.
</P>
<P>
   When Bela Lugosi died during shooting for the 1959 cult classic
``Plan 9 from Outer Space,'' his dentist filled in for him, cloaked
in a cape. When the actor Brandon Lee died in 1993 during the
filming of ``The Crow,'' the filmmakers digitized his image and
inserted him into new scenes, proving that the latest technology is
just as good as a wide-brimmed hat.
</P>
<P>
   Artists planning to die anytime soon should leave instructions.
They should leave heirs, who can shop around for the right person
to finish the opus. They should focus on one masterwork at a time.
Schubert worked on too many at once, leaving so many fragments that
scholars don't know which piece goes with which.
</P>
<P>
   And they should leave a decent beginning. That way, the
prospective finisher, when in doubt, can always reprise. Franco
Alfano, the poor guy who had to write the end of Puccini's
``Turandot,'' figured he might not be able to think up a better
melody than the one in the aria ``Nessun Dorma,'' so he repeated

THE ART OF FINISHING UNFINISHED ART  
 (EDITORS: NOTE SLUG CHANGE; ORIGINALLY SKEDDED AS
SYMPHONIES-REVIEW)

   Imagine being Franz Xaver Suessmayr. Your teacher, Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart, is dying, just as he's writing one of his greatest
works. On his deathbed he explains how he envisions completing it.
The rest is up to you.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Suessmayr. No one can say which parts of the ``Requiem'' he
had to make up, but he never wrote anything particularly good after
that. Others would later clean up his orchestrations and create new
versions based on newly unearthed sketches. Listening to the
``Requiem'' with all this in mind gives a whole new meaning to the
concert series title ``Mostly Mozart.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing the unfinished artworks of the dead has always been a
tricky business, but it can be a marketable enterprise, as recent
events confirm.
</P>
<P>
   When Ralph Ellison died five years ago, he left no instructions
concerning his 2,000-page draft for a sprawling epic. But it was
trimmed by the scholar John F. Callahan into a 384-page novel,
``Juneteenth,'' and published amid great publicity last week. And
Ernest Hemingway's unfinished ``True at First Light'' was cut from
850 pages to 320 by his son Patrick for publication this July in
time for the writer's 100th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Dead artists tend to have more clout than living ones these
days. After all, thanks to the peculiarities of restoration and
rediscovery, the big art premiere last week was for Leonardo da
Vinci (his newly restored ``Last Supper,'' in Milan, Italy), and at
the Tony awards next Sunday, the late Tennessee Williams could win
in the ``Best New Play'' category (for his newly produced ``Not
About Nightingales'').
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? In an age of cultural recycling, the fine art of
finishing could become a cottage industry.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone shares the same definition of
``finished.'' When Stanley Kubrick died in March, having just made
the final cut of ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' rumors flew that Warner Bros.
might do a little more editing to ensure the movie an ``R'' rating.
Tom Cruise came forward and vowed to fight any alterations.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders what would have happened if Cruise had been friends
with Edith Wharton. Could he have have used his influence to see to
it that her unfinished novel ``The Buccaneers'' would stay
untouched by contemporary completers?
</P>
<P>
   In defense of those who can't leave well enough alone, finishing
a work can bring it to a wider audience. If Marion Mainwaring had
not finished ``The Buccaneers,'' fewer readers would have
encountered this work of Wharton's _ and even fewer would have
tuned in to watch it on TV.
</P>
<P>
   And utterly no one would have seen the unproduced final drama of
Frances Sheridan, an 18th-century novelist, if a contemporary
writer hadn't added an ending 233 years after her death. The
resulting play, ``The Whisperers,'' with three acts by Sheridan and
two more in Restoration language by Elizabeth Kuti, premiered in
Ireland this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Collaborating with the dead creates special challenges. It means
seeing every note on a napkin as a little ``how-to'' manual,
ignoring unhelpful instructions like, ``Burn this if you find it,''
and wildly guessing what the artist would have wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Designers in Barcelona have been guessing since 1926 how to
finish the Sagrada Familia church in the spirit that the architect
Gaudi intended _ though no one can agree whether that spirit means
building it as originally specified, updating it or leaving it
magnificently half-built.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dickens left a half-written murder mystery without a
killer. In the ingenious musical adaptation of ``The Mystery of
Edwin Drood'' in the 1980s, the audience chose the murderer by
voting. Different endings were performed each night.
</P>
<P>
   While Dickens might be as startled to discover the Broadway
version of his detective novel as Victor Hugo would be to see a
touring company of ``Les Miz,'' the show's creators did demonstrate
a certain respect for Dickens by leaving the story unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   And audiences don't mind a little open-endedness. They will
happily vote on an ending. They will turn out to see performances
of Bach's unfinished ``The Art of the Fugue'' that stop where Bach
did. They will read ``The Last Tycoon'' though F. Scott Fitzgerald
didn't finish it.
</P>
<P>
   But in cases where the artist is the art, audiences may need a
little closure. When Jean Harlow died in 1937 during the filming of
``Saratoga,'' her fans wanted the movie released, so her remaining
scenes were shot with Mary Dees, who stood as far from the camera
as possible in a wide-brimmed hat.
</P>
<P>
   When Bela Lugosi died during shooting for the 1959 cult classic
``Plan 9 from Outer Space,'' his dentist filled in for him, cloaked
in a cape. When the actor Brandon Lee died in 1993 during the
filming of ``The Crow,'' the filmmakers digitized his image and
inserted him into new scenes, proving that the latest technology is
just as good as a wide-brimmed hat.
</P>
<P>
   Artists planning to die anytime soon should leave instructions.
They should leave heirs, who can shop around for the right person
to finish the opus. They should focus on one masterwork at a time.
Schubert worked on too many at once, leaving so many fragments that
scholars don't know which piece goes with which.
</P>
<P>
   And they should leave a decent beginning. That way, the
prospective finisher, when in doubt, can always reprise. Franco
Alfano, the poor guy who had to write the end of Puccini's
``Turandot,'' figured he might not be able to think up a better
melody than the one in the aria ``Nessun Dorma,'' so he repeated
the theme.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with a beginning can provide inspiration. The act of
finishing another's work may illuminate one's own creative
struggles. Or it may promise, in the grand tradition of the
cathedral and the sitcom, a revival of the artist who selflessly
collaborates with others, throwing in jokes or gargoyles for the
sake of the enduring whole and not for the sole credit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, credit may be taken. After finishing Titian's ``Pieta,''
Palma Giovine painted a Latin inscription that read, ``What Titian
began and left behind, Palma reverently completed and dedicated to
God'' _ thus putting all the creators in their proper places.

THERE'S A RESURGENCE OF POETS, AND THEY KNOW IT

   NEW YORK _ Now that the fanfare around National Poetry Month in
April has died down _ the readings, the slams, the tractor pulls _
there is time for a little serious contemplation about the future
of the form.
</P>
<P>
   Questions abound: Is there a hot genre? What will the new
millennium bring? Are the poetry wars over? Have the Nuyoricans,
those anti-establishment aesthetes , sold out? And, finally, will
it ever be OK to rhyme again?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The answer is
</P>
<P>
   you surely knew
</P>
<P>
   Dependent on
</P>
<P>
   your point of view.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with poets, academics, editors and others
lyrically minded, the only point of agreement seems to be that
poetry is enjoying a remarkable renaissance, from cowboy poetry
festivals in the West to daily bits of verse published on the
Internet. Robert Pinsky, the United States' poet laureate, does
regular poetry readings on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Bookstores carry the work of this year's Pulitzer Prize winner,
Mark Strand,
 &UR; I think of the innocent lives
</P>
<P>
   Of people in novels who know they'll die
</P>
<P>
   But not that the novel will end. &LR; alongside the work of the
socialist street poet named Sparrow:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; There is a sickness eating away at the
</P>
<P>
   American people _ an illness, a pox
</P>
<P>
   upon this nation-state. And that illness is...Classic Rock.  &LR;  It
is that abundant variety of contemporary poetry, the professionals
say, that makes it so difficult to predict the direction of poetry
in the coming years. Not that there aren't a few ideas. For Pinsky,
the most important current trend has less to do with a particular
style of poetry than its presentation: oral, not printed.
</P>
<P>
   The poet Dana Gioia, the author of ``Can Poetry Matter?''
(Greywolf Press, 1992), said the hottest thing happening in poetry
is rap music. The idea that rap music is poetry is not new; its
increasing popularity and sophistication has Gioia thinking it is
the style to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rap is spoken poetry,'' Gioia said. ``Rap music is essentially
written in the same base meter as `Beowulf,' the difference being
that rap is rhymed and Beowulf isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars say that the resurgence of interest in spoken
poetry means that poetry has come full circle, from its ancient
roots in chants and songs through its emergence as a powerful
written form and, finally, in recent years, back to a more oral
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Between the primitive and the postmodern, of course, were dozens
of styles. In the first 600 years of this millennium, poetry moved
from the epic medieval lyrics and tales of Chaucer to the airy,
metaphysical, lovelorn sonnets (holy and otherwise) of Shakespeare
and Donne. Movements and their adjectives each had their time: the
lush Romantics, like Byron, owned the early 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; She walks in beauty, like the night
</P>
<P>
   Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
</P>
<P>
   And all that's best of dark and bright
</P>
<P>
   Meet in her aspect and her eyes.  &LR;  More restrained, the
Victorians dominated the late 1800s and the knotty _ and naughty _
Moderns ruled after that. But the Moderns (Stevens, Eliot, Auden)
became the Establishment, and eventually some people (those
rascally Beats) started complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the current writing style, some say it's the classics
that are in vogue. Alice Quinn, the poetry editor of The New
Yorker, said that for years while teaching her graduate course at
Columbia University she spent ample time on 19th- and 20th-century
masters like Robert Frost and Emily Dickinson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fame is a bee.  &LR;   &UR; It has a song _
</P>
<P>
   It has a sting _
</P>
<P>
   Ah, too, it has a wing.  &LR;  ``I suddenly realized,'' Ms. Quinn
said, ``that what they really wanted, the people becoming writers,
was a survey class from Chaucer to Yeats.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Quinn believes the real money may lie even farther in
the past. ``What are the books that have done well in recent
years?'' she asked. ``Dante, Ovid, Horace.'' Each of which, Ms.
Quinn noted, have been translated and re-imagined by modern poets.
Recent popular translations include Pinsky's version of Dante,
``Gilgamesh'' by David Ferry and Ovid by the late Ted Hughes.
Coming soon are Ferry's translation on Virgil and Seamus Heaney's
take on Beowulf.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the poetry establishment has had some problems lately. In
March, the Academy of American Poets, the home of poetry's elite,
announced it would make significant changes in the structure of its
board of directors in response to critics who had called it far too
homogeneous. More women and minority members will be invited to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the board, Jonathan Galassi, the editor in
chief at Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux and a poet himself, said the
changes reflected variety of thought in contemporary poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take the academy as a bellwether, we expanded the Board
of Chancellors to represent a lot of different parts of the
spectrum,'' Galassi said. ``In a way, I think that's a sign that
there's more stuff out there. That's the picture now.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, most poetry professionals agreed the passions
of the poetry wars of the mid-1990s (roughly the establishment vs.
everybody else) have subsided.
</P>
<P>
   The poet Bob Holman presided over the growth of poetry slams a
decade ago while serving as the ``slam master'' at the Nuyorican
Poets Cafe in the East Village. Loud and declamatory, slams are
competitions where poets shout out their work, often with a
microphone in hand and their bodies in motion. The winners are
chosen by the audience. Alliteration and assonance are key
elements, as in the work of Saul Williams, a Nuyorican alumnus.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Blowing tunes through lunar wombs
</P>
<P>
   impregnating stars giving birth to suns
</P>
<P>
   that darken the skins that skin our drums.  &LR;  In the mid-1990s a
group of Nuyorican types known as the Unbearables protested outside
The New Yorker, demanding that their work be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Holman, who called himself a ``bemused bystander'' to the
Unbearable events, said each side has since come to see the value
of the other. ``Various traditions now exist side by side,'' he
said, ``and all are finding their audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are finding large audiences. This summer's National Poetry
Slam in Chicago will have a record 48 teams of four poets each.
That comes on the heels of last year's well-received independent
film, ``Slam.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the next generation, there are only hints.
</P>
<P>
   Don Lee, an editor at the literary magazine Ploughshares, said
the Internet is the ideal means of dissemination and
experimentation. ``A short story or a novel is impossible to read
on the screen,'' Lee said. ``Poetry is very easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy, perhaps, but by no means simple _ or harmonious.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always going to be people saying what the other side
is doing is stodgy or stupid,'' Lee said. ``That's been going on
since poetry began.''  &QL;

STOP WHINING CITY-SLICKERS, OR, HOW THE WEST ISN'T ALWAYS FUN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By TOM KUNTZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're anything like the pampered, reluctant farmer's wife
played by Eva Gabor in ``Green Acres'' _ ``Dahling, I love you, but
give me Park Avenue'' _ then you definitely want to think twice
about moving to rural Washington state. Officials in Spokane
County, in the eastern part of the state, have had it with
city-bred newcomers complaining about the less amenable aspects of
the boondocks. And so the Spokane County Commission this month
published a pamphlet called the ``Code of the West'' to forewarn
new and prospective residents about the pitfalls of supposedly
idyllic country life.
</P>
<P>
   You might also call it ``How the West Is Not Fun.'' Here are
excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The pamphlet starts with some historical context:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Code of the West was first chronicled by famous western
writer Zane Grey. The men and women who came to this part of the
country during the United States' westward expansion were bound by
an unwritten code of conduct. The values of integrity and
self-reliance guided their decisions, actions and interactions. In
keeping with that same spirit, we offer this information to help
citizens of Spokane County who wish to follow in the footsteps of
those rugged individualists and live outside the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For starters, the pamphlet says, forget about essential public
services on a par with cities and towns. The county can't afford
them:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _Emergency response times for sheriff, fire suppression, medical
care, etc., cannot be guaranteed. Under some extreme conditions,
you may find that emergency response is extremely slow and
expensive. ...
</P>
<P>

STOP WHINING CITY-SLICKERS, OR, HOW THE WEST ISN'T ALWAYS FUN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By TOM KUNTZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're anything like the pampered, reluctant farmer's wife
played by Eva Gabor in ``Green Acres'' _ ``Dahling, I love you, but
give me Park Avenue'' _ then you definitely want to think twice
about moving to rural Washington state. Officials in Spokane
County, in the eastern part of the state, have had it with
city-bred newcomers complaining about the less amenable aspects of
the boondocks. And so the Spokane County Commission this month
published a pamphlet called the ``Code of the West'' to forewarn
new and prospective residents about the pitfalls of supposedly
idyllic country life.
</P>
<P>
   You might also call it ``How the West Is Not Fun.'' Here are
excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The pamphlet starts with some historical context:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Code of the West was first chronicled by famous western
writer Zane Grey. The men and women who came to this part of the
country during the United States' westward expansion were bound by
an unwritten code of conduct. The values of integrity and
self-reliance guided their decisions, actions and interactions. In
keeping with that same spirit, we offer this information to help
citizens of Spokane County who wish to follow in the footsteps of
those rugged individualists and live outside the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For starters, the pamphlet says, forget about essential public
services on a par with cities and towns. The county can't afford
them:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _Emergency response times for sheriff, fire suppression, medical
care, etc., cannot be guaranteed. Under some extreme conditions,
you may find that emergency response is extremely slow and
expensive. ...
</P>
<P>
   _School buses travel only on maintained county roads designated
as school bus routes by the school district. If you live on a
private road, you may need to drive your children to the nearest
county road or bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The county's many private access roads are often in bad shape, the
pamphlet says. And guess what? They're your problem:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _Natural disasters, especially floods, can destroy roads. ...

want to have the road treated for dust suppression by one of the

   In Clash Over Kashmir, India Sends In Its First Jets
</P>
<P>
   Two Indian jets were lost in airstrikes against a large force of
guerrillas dug into the mountains of Kashmir. It was the first time
New Delhi has used jet fighters and helicopters gunships in its
decade-long dispute with Pakistan, sharply increasing tensions in
the nuclear-armed subcontinent.
</P>

   India's ground troops have so far failed to dislodge 500 to 600

Mountains. India says the force is operating with Pakistan's

   Cloned Sheep's Cells Aging

   The genetic material in Dolly, the sheep that was the first
animal to be successfully cloned from an adult, may be showing a

said the scientists in Scotland who created the animal. If
confirmed, the finding would be the first sign of possible genetic
abnormalities in cloned animals.

   Leading investigators said they were not yet convinced by the

   Nearly three years after John Huang emerged as a central figure
in the furor over how Democrats financed President Clinton's
re-election, the Justice Department announced that Huang would
plead guilty to a single felony charge of conspiring to make
illegal contributions. Republicans dismissed the plea agreement as
a sweetheart deal: Huang will receive no jail time in exchange for
his continuing cooperation with authorities. Federal prosecutors
will also clear him of charges contained in congressional reports
on the fund-raising issue that he may have had an espionage
relationship with China.

   A School's Responsibility

   As the Supreme Court interpreted federal laws over the years to
provide protection against sexual harassment, uncertainty remained
over whether any law even applied to harassment of one student by
another. Now, as a result of a bitterly fought 5-4 ruling, school
districts are on notice that they can be sued for failing to stop
severe and pervasive harassment in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The court's dissenters said the ruling opened the door to
massive federal intrusion. But school board lawyers said that it
was clear the ruling applied only to egregious behavior and that
they could live with it.

   New Hampshire's New Holiday
</P>
<P>
   As one civil rights advocate put it, New Hampshire won the race
to be last. It effectively agreed to become the 50th state to adopt
a holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The state
House of Representatives, which had resisted in the past, voted
solidly to attach King's name to the existing Civil Rights Day, and
no further hindrances remained to the new holiday. Most other
states approved a Martin Luther King Day in the 1980s. So what took
New Hampshire so long? Some holiday advocates said it was not
racism that resisted the change but the tradition-bound,
independent-minded nature of residents.

organs of the body. Biologists hope these cells may directly
replace damaged tissues, including brain cells lost in Parkinson's
disease.

   Last year was good for charity: Americans donated a record $175
billion, 11 percent more than in 1997, according to Giving USA
1999, put out by the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel's
nonprofit arm. The only area that declined was the arts, culture
and humanities (down about 1 percent). But donations jumped by 20
percent or more in environment and wildlife, health, human services
and public benefit organizations (which includes civil rights
groups, public affairs, consumer protection and scientific
development).

the Nasdaq stock market is planning an evening trading session,

Exchange's board will consider a similar proposal when it meets on
Thursday. Some Wall Street professionals expect that stock markets
will soon be open around the clock _ just like casinos.

   Diplomacy and Betrayal
</P>
<P>
   The balance of power between the United States and the United
Nations is always tricky. And now former Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, in his book ``Unvanquished: A U.S.-U.N. Saga,''
writes of his 1996 ouster, blaming it on caving in to Bob Dole's
``claim that American troops served under my `command.''' He feels
especially betrayed by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, he
says, accusing her of lecturing instead of doing ``the difficult
diplomatic work of persuading.'' Albright's spokesman, James Rubin,
said Boutros-Ghali had neglected his core duty: ``Smooth
cooperation with the United States.''

   A Respite (Sort of) for Springer
</P>
<P>
   Many fans of ``The Jerry Springer Show'' were angered when the
episodes ``Guess What? I'm Bisexual'' and ``My Daughter Wants to Be
an Adult Film Star'' were yanked, replaced by tamer, 6-year-old
reruns. Some station owners were peeved, too, because the show
mesmerizes viewers at a Nielsen-rating level second only to
``Oprah'' and ``Judge Judy,'' earning scads of money.
</P>
<P>
   But Studios USA, the show's owner, was getting political heat
again about the daily format of sexual confrontations leading to
fights. And a Chicago alderman, Edward M. Burke, wanted to know why
off-duty Chicago policemen working as security guards don't arrest
guests for assault and battery.
</P>
<P>
   So executives at Studios USA got righteous _ again. First, they
announced they would ``control'' the violence (April 1998). Then
they said they'd ``eliminate'' it (June). They were also going to
``edit it responsibly'' (July). But the ratings fell. So breast
baring and hair pulling resumed. Now they say ``violence, physical
confrontation or profanity'' will again be edited out.

   Nikita Khrushchev, his son Sergei said, once told Richard Nixon,
``Your grandsons will live in a communist America.'' To which Nixon
replied, ``No, your grandsons will live in a capitalist Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, long after that quintessential nugget of Cold War
bluster, who has come closest to winning the bet? It would be a
stretch to say capitalism has truly taken root in Russia. America
hasn't gone communist, but it did lure a Khrushchev to its shores _
and in one generation, not two.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Sergei N. Khrushchev and his wife, Valentina Golenko,
became legal residents of Rhode Island. Khrushchev, unable to
venture abroad for 25 years after his father's ouster in 1964, said
one overriding attraction was the freedom to travel. Khrushchev had
been a member of the Soviet Communist Party, but Nixon, who spent a
good part of his career demonizing communists, supported his
resident-alien status.

<P>
   Now Khrushchev, 63, a rocket engineer turned Brown University

   Day and Night Trading
</P>
<P>
   Citing demand from individuals who want to use the Internet to
trade stocks outside the normal market hours of 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
the Nasdaq stock market is planning an evening trading session,
lasting as late as 10, to begin later this year. The New York Stock
Exchange's board will consider a similar proposal when it meets on
Thursday. Some Wall Street professionals expect that stock markets
will soon be open around the clock _ just like casinos.

   _ EDWARD WYATT
</P>
<P>
   Diplomacy and Betrayal
</P>
<P>
   The balance of power between the United States and the United
Nations is always tricky. And now former Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, in his book ``Unvanquished: A U.S.-U.N. Saga,''
writes of his 1996 ouster, blaming it on caving in to Bob Dole's
``claim that American troops served under my `command.''' He feels
especially betrayed by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, he
says, accusing her of lecturing instead of doing ``the difficult
diplomatic work of persuading.'' Albright's spokesman, James Rubin,
said Boutros-Ghali had neglected his core duty: ``Smooth
cooperation with the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   _ HUBERT B. HERRING
</P>
<P>
   A Respite (Sort of) for Springer
</P>
<P>
   Many fans of ``The Jerry Springer Show'' were angered when the
episodes ``Guess What? I'm Bisexual'' and ``My Daughter Wants to Be
an Adult Film Star'' were yanked, replaced by tamer, 6-year-old
reruns. Some station owners were peeved, too, because the show
mesmerizes viewers at a Nielsen-rating level second only to
``Oprah'' and ``Judge Judy,'' earning scads of money.
</P>
<P>
   But Studios USA, the show's owner, was getting political heat
again about the daily format of sexual confrontations leading to
fights. And a Chicago alderman, Edward M. Burke, wanted to know why
off-duty Chicago policemen working as security guards don't arrest
guests for assault and battery.
</P>
<P>
   So executives at Studios USA got righteous _ again. First, they
announced they would ``control'' the violence (April 1998). Then
they said they'd ``eliminate'' it (June). They were also going to
``edit it responsibly'' (July). But the ratings fell. So breast
baring and hair pulling resumed. Now they say ``violence, physical
confrontation or profanity'' will again be edited out.
</P>
<P>
   _ LAWRIE MIFFLIN
</P>
<P>
   Former Soviet, American-to-be
</P>
<P>
   Nikita Khrushchev, his son Sergei said, once told Richard Nixon,
``Your grandsons will live in a communist America.'' To which Nixon
replied, ``No, your grandsons will live in a capitalist Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, long after that quintessential nugget of Cold War
bluster, who has come closest to winning the bet? It would be a
stretch to say capitalism has truly taken root in Russia. America
hasn't gone communist, but it did lure a Khrushchev to its shores _
and in one generation, not two.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Sergei N. Khrushchev and his wife, Valentina Golenko,
became legal residents of Rhode Island. Khrushchev, unable to
venture abroad for 25 years after his father's ouster in 1964, said
one overriding attraction was the freedom to travel. Khrushchev had
been a member of the Soviet Communist Party, but Nixon, who spent a
good part of his career demonizing communists, supported his
resident-alien status.
</P>
<P>
   Now Khrushchev, 63, a rocket engineer turned Brown University
research scholar, and his wife are applying for American
citizenship.

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other

articles for sale. Please contact us for availability your country.

<TEXT>
<P>
   1. THE NEXT CLINTON What are the politics of being a first lady,
a potential senator - and a Clintonian above all? Does Hillary
Clinton really want to be a senator from New York? Could she
survive a street fight with a nasty opponent? Could she stand the
pawing of New York City's feral reporters? In the chance to win
office for herself, Clinton glimpses freedom, or so her friends and
advisers say - freedom to participate in politics fully, with her
own constituents, on her own terms, for her own purposes. By James
Bennet. From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length (8,500 words)
+ edited article available. 2. A BRUTAL CURE A young man's
tuberculosis had resisted every drug treatment. His last hope was a
crude technique abandoned in the 1950s : the wholesale removal of
his diseased lung. By Lisa Belkin. From The New York Times
Magazine. Full-length (4,900 words) + edited article available.
_______________________________________________________________ 3.
MY NEW SOUTH AFRICAN IDENTITY As the Mandela era draws to a close,
South Africa's most renowned novelist sees her nation, for all its
problems, embracing an expanded notion of 'us.' By Nadine Gordimer.
From The New York Times Magazine. 3,000 words.

DEPRESSED? TRY HEROIN : A CASE FOR LEGALIZING DRUGS
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE ELDERLY Paul Parin, 83, is a prominent psychoanalyst and
ethnographer. The son of a Jewish landholder in Slovenia, he left
that country in 1938 and completed his medical studies in
Switzerland. In 1944-45 he served as a doctor for the Yugoslav
Partisans. Back in Zurich, he and his wife Goldy practiced
psychoanalysis for 40 years. Now a widower, Parin has often taken
provocative stances. Recently he sparked controversy by calling for
the legalization of hard drugs for older people. Otherwise, he
says, they would suffer needlessly. The risk of addiction, Parin
insists, is irrelevant if someone has only a short time to live.
From Der Spiegel. 1,000 words. (English translation available.) 
____________________________________________________________________
____________ 5. WHO'S OUT THERE? The search for intelligent life in
outer space is going so well, scientists need a little help from
you and your home computer. Astrophysicist Dan Werthimer is looking
for aliens, or more precisely, he is listening for them via a
modified screen saver for a personal computer. His brainchild -
called SETIhome - is a data saving software program that masks as a
screen saver and will allow amateur computer jockeys to receive and
collate chunks of data from outer space from the privacy of their
own homes. By Jeff Greenwald. From Discover magazine. 1,000 words +
photos. 6. WHAT'S DOING IN VENICE Events, sightseeing, hotels and
restaurants in Venice. By Alessandra Stanley. From The New York
Times Way To Go! 2,000 words + photos. 7. MICHAEL OVITZ,
SUPERAGENT, IS BACK Michael Ovitz, the superagent who once ruled
Hollywood by fear, is back. In the '80s he cornered the market on
movie talent, but that kind of power wasn't enough for him. Now
he's scrambling to get that talent again - and reminding Hollywood
how much trouble he can make. By Lynn Hirschberg. From The New York
Times Magazine. Full-length (8,300 words) + edited article
available.

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Tuesday, June 1, 1999:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KOSOVO &LR;  (Category `i')
</P>

Arlington National Cemetery. By John N. Broder.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-PENTAGON (Washington) _ Military developments in Kosovo.
By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OTHER INTERNATIONAL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TIANANMEN (Beijing) _ Ten years after army troops and
tanks were used to smash pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen
Square, more than one hundred relatives of the dead have petitioned
the government to open a criminal investigation of the officials
responsible. By Eric Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S. (Beijing) _ China's information minister calls a
special press conference to deride and denounce the Cox report on
Chinese spying, while showing a U.S. internet site that has much
U.S. nuclear information. By Eric Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-POLITICS (Moscow) _ Another reformer, Viktor Khristenko,
is appointed first deputy prime minister in charge of economy,
replacing the official who lasted in the job for three days last
week. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-PAKISTAN ( New Delhi) _ India's prime minister accepts
Pakistani offer of high-level talks on Kashmir. By Celia W. Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-ELECT (Johannesburg) _ Reporter's Notebook on the South
African election Wednesday. By Suzanne Daley.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Category `a')
</P>
<P>
   ILL-MUSEUM (Chicago) _ Finding themselves face-to-face _ or
rather face-to-knee _ with a colossal, roseate statue of
Tutankhamen, museumgoers returned this weekend to the Oriental
Institute for the first time since 1996, when its galleries were
closed to the public for remodeling. By David W. Dunlop.
</P>
<P>
   REFORM-JEWS (Undated) _ More than a century ago, leaders of
Reform Judaism declared such practices as wearing skullcaps and
prayer shawls and using Hebrew in services to be the dated relics
of the past, and emphasized instead a focus on social ethics and a
highly cerebral approach to the faith. But in a symbolically
resonant gesture, and with an eye on the approach of a new century,
Reform's rabbinic arm, the Central Conference of American Rabbis,
last week adopted a document that encourages the movement's members
to explore traditional rituals. By Gustav Niebuhr and Nadine
Brozan.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINANCIAL &LR;  (category `f')
</P>
<P>
   FOOD-LAWS (Undated) _ A patchwork of state libel laws that was
aimed at protecting makers of agricultural products from food
scares is putting a chill on what kinds of projects broadcasters
and publishers are willing to back. By Iver Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   RAIL-TRAFFIC (Undated) _ Beginning Tuesday, Norfolk Southern and
CSX, which already dominate commercial rail traffic in much of the
East, take over chunks of the huge Conrail system. The switchover
will herald the most sweeping change in a generation in the
Northeast's commercial railroads _ especially in the New York area.
By Agis Salpukas .
</P>
<P>
   LAWYERS-ASSESS (Undated) _ In recent weeks, two prominent
securities lawyers have found themselves standing before judges
with lawyers of their own. While the two cases are very different
in magnitude, both illuminate the power that defense lawyers wield
in securities-law prosecutions _ and the limits of the Securities
and Exchange Commission's patience with defense lawyers who may
have used that power improperly. By Diana B. Henriques.
</P>
<P>
   YEN-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ The so-called yen carry trade _
which contributed to the currency plunges that set off the global
financial crisis in 1997 _ is back. With the recent widening of the
spread between Japanese and American interest rates, this
speculative trade is an opportunity for investors again. Still,
there are not a lot of takers, maybe because of the losses that
some speculators suffered when this trade backfired. By Jonathan
Fuerbringer.
</P>
<P>
   KOREA-ECON (Tokyo) _ Just when it looked like South Korea was
about to overhaul its rickety financial system, the country's
unexpectedly rapid recovery has cast doubt on the government's
resolve to dispose of some of the worst banks. By Stephanie Strom.

COMPUSERVE BACK WITH A NEW LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Guess what? CompuServe is still alive!
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe you didn't think it was dead. But chances are, you
haven't given it much thought over the past few years, which is why
it's had so much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing a recent television commercial for the one-time top
dog in online services, I thought it was time to give CompuServe
another try. The last time we parted company, I believe the
software had just crashed my computer.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't exactly a beginner when I first signed on with
CompuServe (www.compuserve.com).
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1987, I covered the police and fire beat for ``The
Phoenix Gazette.'' My office in the ``cop shop,'' otherwise known
as the Phoenix Police Department headquarters, had a weird little
computer that connected to the newspaper building via a 300-baud
modem.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the computer wasn't so little. It was about the size
of a large microwave oven. And it was green! I used that machine to
transmit my stories to the ``Gazette's'' computer system a few
blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   When things slowed down between deadlines, I'd explore the
workings of my electronic friend. I discovered that I could use it
to connect to computer bulletin boards run by computer enthusiasts
around town, a local law enforcement agency and even a Valley
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   That's all it took. I was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, I had a desktop PC at home, and I used that baby to
connect to computer bulletin boards and what was then a new service
_ America Online (www.aol.com).
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, I was asked to take over the job as computer
writer for ``The Gazette.'' I discovered that the position came
with a CompuServe account. I was excited to give the service a try.
After all, CompuServe was the granddaddy of online services.
</P>
<P>
   After a few months of using CompuServe almost daily, I found
myself logging on fewer and fewer times each week. Meanwhile, I was
spending more and more time on America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The reason was simple: I found America Online easier to use.
Despite having been online for a few years, I found CompuServe
complicated. It made me feel as though I'd walked into a private
club, wasn't dressed right and didn't see anybody I knew.
</P>
<P>
   With America Online, I could log in and chat with someone or
check out messages in a special interest forum without trouble. On
CompuServe, exploring forums required signing up and looking for
messages in special places.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the constant worry that I'd accidentally ventured
into a special-use area that would add charges to my monthly
CompuServe bill.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise to me when, several years later, America
Online passed CompuServe in popularity. Today, America Online now
between 17 million and 18 million members, about 1.1 million of
whom are always online at the same time. AOL says that's about
double the prime-time television audience that views CNN.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I became the computer writer for ``The Arizona
Republic,'' I'd pretty much quit doing stories about CompuServe.
Although I do remember doing an article back in 1996 about
CompuServe's ill-fated comeback attempt via a new service it
called, simply, Wow!
</P>
<P>
   But a lot has changed since then. Today, of course, CompuServe
is owned by AOL. And, despite recent layoffs, CompuServe is on the
comeback trail, having just released its latest software version _
CompuServe 2000 for Windows 95 and 98.
</P>
<P>
   I downloaded and installed the software the other day. Then it
took me about 10 minutes to open a new account, sign on and begin
exploring.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? Although the new CompuServe is all Web-based and is
geared toward adults, it looks and feels like AOL. Not much
surprise there, I suppose.
</P>
<P>
   What I like about the new CompuServe is that it's been
streamlined. Pages are clean and crisp. Navigation is simple,
thanks to a menu bar at the top. And because it's geared toward
adults, CompuServe lacks the annoying kiddie stuff you'll find on
AOL.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the famous CompuServe forums? They're still there!
Veterans may complain that the forums aren't what they used to be.
But there's still plenty of quality information, whether you're
interested in the latest headlines, how to plant a garden, Web-site
design, personal finance, travel or just about anything in between.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, I found the service a bit slow at times. And there remain
a few maddening glitches. A special page devoted to the new Austin
Powers movie, for example, just would not load for me. And I tried
several times during a six-hour period. Additionally, sometimes the
back button at the top of the screen would work, sometimes it
wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing for the revamped CompuServe is on par with what AOL
charges. Pricing plans include a $9.95-a-month plan that comes with
20 hours (extra hours cost $2.95 each), a $19.95-a-month plan with
unlimited use and an unlimited-use annual fee of $199.
</P>
<P>
   Why try CompuServe? For one thing, with just 2 million members
it should be easier to dial into than AOL. Also, it looks and feels
like a big Web site, so it's easy to find your way around. And
those forums are packed with tons of information.
</P>
<P>
   I can't imagine CompuServe will ever again be the granddaddy of
online services. But it just might be the comfortable online spot
you've been looking for. &QL; 
Web sites of the week &QL; 
- It's hot outside. The kids are bored. What to do? You might fire
up the computer and check out Favorite Kid Links. Find the site at
www.goodnet.com/eel (Note the tilde before eel.) The site is the
creation of Lee, who lives in Scottsdale, Ariz. You'll find links
to sites for Barney, Blues Clues, Rugrats and more. There is even a
couple pages of links for Mom and Dad.
</P>
<P>
   - If you surf the Web a lot, you might be tired of having to
fill out all those registration forms by hand or having to remember
all those passwords to access special sites. Here's an idea:
Jotter(at)Your Service. It's a free utility developed by Jotter
Technologies Inc. in Mesa, formerly known as Mindquake Interactive.
Find out how it works at www.jotter.com.
</P>
<P>
   - Looking to buy a computer, digital camera or some other
electronic gadget? Check 20-20Consumer first. The Web site, at
www.20-20consumer.com, claims to be an independent consumer
comparison-shopping service that updates its price listings daily.
It's not a store, but service that surveys what retailers are
asking for specific items. It's worth a look!
</P>
<P>
   - Are you one of those people who likes to send electronic
greeting cards? Now you can send an e-mail greeting with original
music that mentions the recipient's name in the lyrics! Valley
residents Tim and Kathy Penrod are the people behind
MusicalGreetings.com, at www.musicalgreetings.com. Don't like
sending e-mail? You can also get the greeting on an audio CD or
cassette tape so it can be mailed to the recipient. Prices start at
just $7.95. &QL;

   &UR; SCIENCE TIMES  &LR; (Category `a')
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ASTRO (Chicago) _ The first results of a new survey of the
heavens has found a large number of so-called brown dwarfs, which
are bigger than planets but smaller than stars. By John Noble
Wilford.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FLEAS (Undated) _ Fleas' habits would surely place them
among the more repulsive of living things. Upon landing on their
victim, they proceed to harass, extract blood, induce allergic
reactions, introduce infectious organisms and deposit their eggs on
their unwelcoming host. As if that is not enough of a turnoff, the
tiny worm-like larvae emerging from the eggs feed principally on
the feces of their parents, who nourish the next generation with
partially digested blood. By Jane E. Brody.
</P>
<P>
   With photo and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-STATUS (Undated) _ Scientists have known for decades that
poverty translates into higher rates of illness and mortality. But
an explosion of research is demonstrating that social class _ as
measured not just by income but also by education and other markers
of relative status _ is one of the most powerful predictors of
health, more powerful than genetics, exposure to carcinogens, even
smoking. By Erica Goode.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-TRIANA (Undated) _ Al Gore's midnight inspiration for a
satellite that could provide continuous Earth views grew into a
scientifically worthy mission before it ran into politcal
opposition. By Warren E. Leary.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WOLF (Undated) _ Timber wolves from Canada are unlikely to
recolonize the northeastern United States on their own, leaving the
politically more contentious course of deliberate reintroduction as
the best strategy for restoring the wild wolf's howl to the region,
a new study sponsored by New York's Wildlife Conservation Society
has found. w/ sidebar. By William K. Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WOLF-ROCKIES (Undated) _ Experimental restoration of the
gray wolf to Montana, Idaho and Wyoming has been so successful
since 1995, Federal officials say, that the first steps toward a
single, integrated wolf population in the Northern Rockies have now
been taken. By William K. Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   With map.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MATING-ESSAY (Undated) _ Because mating lies at the center
of so much of life, it is a particularly important area of study
for evolutionary psychologists. Sociologically, mating affects the
distribution of wealth. Psychologically, it influences nearly
everything from depression to social success. Mate preferences _
how we pick partners, attract them, conflict with them, keep them,
lose them, and then start all over again _ determine who is
selected and shunned, altering our species' evolution. By David M.
Buss.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FAMINE (Undated) _ Hordes of creatures living in the hidden
depths of the deep sea are in danger of starving to death,
scientists report. This remote part of the planet is believed to
harbor millions of undiscovered species, an unknown number of which
may be in crisis. By William J. Broad.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-WATCH (Undated) _ Items on research with implication in
molecular-scale devices, what can be learned from ancient emu eggs
and an 18th moon for Uranus.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CENTENARIAN (Undated) _ Until recently, very few people
lived to be more than 100 years old, but more and more are living
to extreme old age in very good health. A study of 169 centenarians
in Massachusetts reveals: Only three have had cancer; a
disproportionate number are women who never married; there is no
pattern of diet and exercise; the only common personality trait is
the ability to manage stress; about 80 percent are women, but the
relatively few men in the group are far healthier than the women,
and among the women who are mothers, the ones who had children
after age 40 are disproportionately represented. By Philip J.
Hilts.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-STEROIDS (Undated) _ Girls with an interest in the lean
muscular look are turning increasingly to steroids, say prominent
researchers in field. Meanwhile, use among boys also is increasing.
By Holcomb B. Noble.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-STREND (Undated) _ For those who have fond memories of the
president's Physical Fitness Test, there is now a grown up version
of it called Strend, a challenging six-event contest that is
attracting more and more competitors. By Liz Neporent.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Not all summer camps are created
equally. And safety should be a major consideration for parents.
Tips for choosing safer summer camps. By Jane E. Brody.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SUNSCREEN (Undated) _ New guidelines and definitions for
sunscreens are introduced. By Alisha Berger.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ If a body temperature of 107 degrees
Fahrenheit is nearly always fatal, what low body temperature is
generally fatal? By C. Claiborne Ray.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEART (Undated) _ Adding a ``super aspirin'' to a standard
clot-dissolving drug was a more effective and safer treatment for
heart attacks in an international study being published. By
Lawrence K. Altman.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HORMONE (Undated) _ By new study suggests that low-dose
hormone replacement therapy combined with calcium and vitamin D
supplements may increase bone mineral density in women over 65 by
at least as much as the higher hormone doses now recommended but
without unpleasant side effects. By Nancy Beth Jackson.
</P>
<P>

BOMBS KILLING MORE CIVILIANS THAN EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite NATO's efforts to keep its war against Slobodan
Milosevic as surgically ``clean'' as possible, the bombing of
Yugoslavia has killed, ton for ton, as many civilians as other air
campaigns of the past quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   In more than two months, NATO has dropped about 15,000 bombs,
releasing about 13,000 tons of explosive power. Remarkably, only a
few dozen of these weapons have gone astray or hit the wrong
target. Yet Serbian sources have reported, and NATO officials do
not deny, that those errant bombs have killed 1,200 civilians _ or
roughly one civilian for every 10 tons dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio is remarkably similar to that of major bombing
campaigns in the Vietnam War. In the 1964-67 Operation Rolling
Thunder, 650,000 tons of bombs unintentionally killed 52,000 North
Vietnamese civilians. In the Christmas 1972 bombing around Hanoi
and Haiphong Harbor, 20,000 tons killed 1,600.
</P>
<P>
   By this measure, the rate of civilian casualties was lower
during the 1991 air war against Iraq, when 100,000 tons of bombs _
more than seven times as many as have been dropped so far in
Yugoslavia _ killed about 2,500 civilians, twice as many as killed
in Yugolavia.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons dropped on Yugoslavia are more accurate than those
of past wars. But that very fact has emboldened commanders to drop
more of them on targets that require accuracy _ for example, a
particular building on a downtown street. And since, as Pentagon
spokesmen note, some of even these bombs are bound to miss, more
civilians die than anyone had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like engineers building bridges,'' said Eliot Cohen, a
professor at Johns Hopkins University's School for Advanced
International Studies and chief author of the US Air Force's
five-volume post-war study of the Iraqi air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is so much better now, you'd think there wouldn't
be any failures at all,'' he continued. ``So why do they happen?
Because, with the new technology, engineers will go closer and
closer to the tolerances of what the materials will handle. They're
pushed to their limits _ and so, something goes wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pape, professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire and
the author of ``Bombing to Win,'' a book about strategic bombing
through the century, makes a similar point: ``It doesn't take much,
in the way of bombs missing their targets, to produce a lot of dead
bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, the comparisons of deaths per ton in previous
wars is somewhat misleading. In the earlier wars, relatively few
bombs _ in the case of Iraq, only about 5 percent _ were dropped on
the centers of cities. In the current war, on the other hand, well
over half the bombs have been aimed at targets in the middle of
Belgrade and other towns.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if NATO were hitting Belgrade's targets with the
weapons of Vietnam or Desert Storm, the level of casualties would
be far, far higher.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, by any measure, the bombing campaigns of recent
times have wreaked far less wanton death and destruction than those
of the more distant past.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, which heralded the age of air power in a big
way, there was scant concern about civilian casualties _ partly
because this was a ``total war,'' and partly because nothing much
could be done about it, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the war, the British Royal Air Force tried to
bomb the ``vital nerve centers'' of the German economy, but that
meant flying in daylight in order to see the targets. German
fighter pilots and anti-aircraft gunners shot the British bombers
out of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Within short order, the British started flying at night. This
was before radar, so they could barely find the right city, much
less specific factories.
</P>
<P>
   So the strategists made a virtue of necessity and declared that
the main target of the attack was the ``morale'' of the German
people. The theory was that, once morale waned, the regime would
crumble or the people would overthrow its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morale bombing'' killed nearly 300,000 German civilians and
wounded another 780,000. One-fifth of all German homes were
destroyed. Sir Arthur Harris, the RAF bomber commander, denied
charges that he was engaging in ``indiscriminate bombing.'' Rather,
Harris responded, he was ``de-housing'' German workers.
</P>
<P>
   Official US studies after the War concluded that this
destruction had no effect on the German war effort and, if
anything, stiffened German morale.
</P>
<P>
   The US Army Air Force stuck with a doctrine of ``precision
bombing'' against Germany, mainly against large industrial
facilities that were easy to see _ power stations, oil refineries,
railyards _ but with mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   In Operation Thunderclap, in February 1945, B-17 bombers tried
to destroy Nazi government buildings in Berlin. And some of them
did, but the bombs fell all around the center of the city,
destroying other things and people, too. Besides, most of the
government ministries had been emptied out (a problem with going
after ministry buildings in Iraq and Serbia, too).
</P>
<P>
   In the war against Japan, ``precision bombing'' failed to hit
much of anything. So the US air commander, General Curtis E. LeMay,
reverted to the British strategy of bombing cities, not specific
targets _ and mainly with firebombs, to spread the damage.
</P>
<P>
   A single attack over Tokyo, on March 9, 1945, involving a convoy
of 334 B-29 bombers, burned up 16 square miles of territory,
killing 83,793 Japanese civilians, wounding 40,918, and leveling
267,171 buildings.
</P>
<P>
   That month, US air raids poured a similar rain of destruction on
33 cities across Japan.
</P>
<P>
   LeMay said in a 1981 interview that he picked his targets out of
the World Almanac, looking at a list of Japan's largest cities and
how many square miles they comprised. Square miles were all his
bombers could hit. In the spring of 1945, he calculated the war
would be over by September _ when, he reasoned, he would run out of
square miles to burn. (As it turned out, the two atomic bombs
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Emperor Hirohito's fear that
more were on the way, ended it a few weeks sooner.)
</P>
<P>
   The Korean War was the last time US commanders deliberately
bombed whole cities, and then just briefly. In 1950, at the start
of the war, B-29s carpet-bombed five North Korean cities. The
results have never been known in the West _ except that it did not
stop the North from waging war.
</P>
<P>
   Korea also saw the first use, in any number, of ``guided''
bombs, which had been introduced at the end of World War II. A
crewman would sit in the bomb bay, with binoculars and a joystick,
guiding the bomb toward its target by radio signals or, later,
radar.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that the pilot had to fly in a straight and
level line for 30 seconds, while the bomb ``locked on'' to its
target. During that time, the plane was an easy target for
antiaircraft gunners. Attrition was horrendous. The Air Force soon
abandoned the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam War saw the debut of guided air-to-ground missiles
that were guided to their targets by a crewman watching it on a TV
screen.
</P>
<P>
   However, according to Pierre M. Sprey, a former Pentagon
official who conducted an official study of guided missiles, the TV
screens had poor resolution, smoke or fog rendered them useless,
and a pilot still had to fly straight and level for 15 seconds _
very risky in an age of not only antiaircraft guns but
surface-to-air missiles, which the North Vietnamese had acquired in
great quantity from their Soviet suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years passed before ``smart bombs,'' as they have been
nicknamed, came of age. In Operation Desert Storm, laser-guided
bombs hit the smallest of targets _ narrow bridges, an airplane on
a runway _ and, in one celebrated case, darted straight down the
chimney of a ministry headquarters, blowing the building to
smithereens.
</P>
<P>
   US Air Force studies after the war revealed the successes had
not been as universal as the widely broadcast film clips suggested.
Still, the new technology allowed commanders to bomb more targets
inside cities, while doing less damage to the surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
   However, the studies also revealed that bombing Baghdad had
little effect on the war. It was, instead, the bombing of Iraq's
tanks and soldiers in the deserts of Kuwait that shattered
resistance to the US ground invasion that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of Belgrade and other Yugoslav cities seems to be
having little effect on the fields of Kosovo as well. Nor is that
its point. John A. Warden, the air-war theorist who devised much of
Desert Storm's strategy, wrote, ``One does not conduct an attack
against industry or infrastructure because of the effect it might
... have on field forces,'' but rather for ``its direct effect on
national leaders'' and how continuing the war will affect ``their
own survival.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, with bombing Serbia's power plants, oil
refineries, TV towers, and other essentials of modern life, NATO
has gone back to bombing the ``morale'' of the enemy people.

 &HT;    MONEY TALK: Advice for novice investors
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of this year's college graduates are eager to start saving
and investing for their future.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect, however, that this generation is no better prepared
for the job than mine was.
</P>
<P>
   Few of today's beginners have gotten any formal education in
managing their investments. A surprising percentage say they rely
on parents or even on their young contemporaries for financial
advice. Our offspring will need plenty of professional help, just
like we did.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, a lot of publishers have offered to sell us
books that promise to give that help.
</P>
<P>
   Notable among these is ``If You're Clueless About the Stock
Market and Want to Know More,'' a yellow-covered competitor for
Eric Tyson's ``Investing for Dummies.''
</P>
<P>
   Seth Godin, author of the ``clueless'' book, has made investing
easy to understand, for the uninitiated and even for complicated
topics.
</P>
<P>
   His explanation of corporate financial reports, for example, is
the clearest I've seen. Godin explains not only how to understand
balance sheets and the like, but also why any investor should do
it.
</P>
<P>
   He makes an admirable case for taking risks of investing in
stock but doing it carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there is plenty of reason to be optimistic about the
long-term financial benefits of investing in stocks,'' he writes,
``there is also a need for individual investors to temper optimism
with a solid dose of caution and good sense. Stocks can be very
lucrative investments, but they can easily be as slippery as
fish.''
</P>
<P>
   This is by no means the only book aimed at novices, but it is
one of the best. Among the strong points: A step-by-step guide to
picking a stockbroker; discussions of common strategies, such as
dividend reinvestment plans and the dogs of the Dow; and lengthy
lists of further resources.
</P>
<P>
   Godin also suggests some crucial pre-investment homework for
beginners:
</P>
<P>
   _ Take care of debt first. Any money you invest in stocks should
be considered risk money, money that is not necessary to keep you,
your family and your dogs and cats alive. Pay the mortgage, pay the
car payment and by all means get rid of those credit card debts.
You most likely will be paying far more in interest on those things
than you will probably make in the market.
</P>
<P>
   _ Think about diversification. Try to build a portfolio of
investments in different types of stocks, or even buy shares in a
bond fund or two. While taking great risks can, and sometimes does,
result in fantastic profits, not losing all your money has more
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never, ever, bet the ranch. No matter how much money your
broker or your friends say you'll make on a stock, don't risk
everything on a single stock.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do your homework. Make sure you really like the company's
financials before you throw your money into the ring. Don't buy
anything that you don't understand and about which you can't find
any information.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't forget the costs. You will pay a commission on every buy
and every sell, so factor that in right from the start. Don't
forget about income taxes on your profits.
</P>
<P>
   Godin does not pretend that every aspect of investing is
straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   But when he comes to an ambiguous topic, such as understanding
the significance of a company's price-to-earnings ratio, he
explains how to put the numbers into a meaningful context.
</P>
<P>
   Given all those ambiguities and uncertainties, a lot of young
investors will choose to abandon stock picking and put their money
into mutual funds instead. A lot of older investors have done the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a mutual fund turns all the uncertainties over to
professionals to wrangle with. If that's your choice, there are
plenty of other books to look into. John Bogle Sr., founder of the
Vanguard Group of mutual funds, has written several. Guess what: So
has Seth Godin.
</P>
<P>
   RESOURCES _ BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   Here are more good books on investing and personal finance,
starting with the simplest and going to the most comprehensive:
</P>
<P>

Your Finances.'' Carolina Edwards and Ray Martin. $12. Truly a
beginner's book. Includes explanations of why things need to be
done and a useful encyclopedia of financial terms.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Green Magazine Guide to Personal Finance: A No B.S. Book
for Your Twenties and Thirties.'' By Ken Kurson. $12.95. Covers a
lot of territory and is strong on explaining the basics.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Making the Most of Your Money,'' Jane Bryant Quinn, $30.
Also ``Marshall Loeb's Lifetime Financial Strategies,'' Marshall
Loeb, $17. Big, all-purpose books on organizing your financial
life.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Wall Street Journal Lifetime Guide to Money,'' edited by
C. Frederic Wiegold, $15.95. Probably the most detailed of the
bunch but still comprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   RESOURCES _ WEB SITES

   Outside there were men dying in icy darkness and mothers
starving in snow-covered street gutters and refugee children trying
to survive that horrible time a half-century ago, when American
soldiers sailed across an ocean to fight a war on the peninsula
called Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst year of my life,'' said Walters, who never
heard his wife's voice the whole time he was away at war. ``It's an
everyday drain on your emotions. It's like a damn debilitating
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kim was 12 in the fall and winter of 1952. Communist
troops had swept through his Korean farming village, and his family
had joined the stream of refugees fleeing south.
</P>
<P>
   He had friends among the 2 million Koreans who died in the war.
Amid the chaos, he lost his family. He was living on the streets
and didn't know whether his family was alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was winter,'' Kim said recently from his home in St. Paul,
Minn. ``You know the cold here in Minnesota. It was colder than
that in Korea. Freezing, hunger, 20 below _ oh, horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Walters, then 26, arrived south of Seoul, at Osan, South Korea,
in November 1952 with Company C, the 841st Engineer Aviation
Battalion. He had gotten lucky, sort of. His orders were to help
build an 11,000-foot airstrip there, behind the front. It gave him
a better chance to keep his name off the casualty list, which would
eventually include 54,000 dead U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-hour workdays, filled with the growl of bulldozers and
the grinding thump of rocks being crushed, exhausted Walters. Every
so often, enemy Korean planes _ known as ``Bed-Check Charlies'' _
would drop bombs on the airfield at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I'd think when I woke up every morning was how
many days until I rotate (home),'' Walters said. ``I kept a count
in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy, Kim, ``just appeared'' at the officers' tent one day,
with flapping ears that made him look a little like Mickey Mouse,
Walters recalled recently at his home in Cumming.
</P>
<P>
   Kim had an infectious smile and a cheery disposition. The only
outward sign of the hardship he had endured was his ragged clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Walters and the five other officers who shared the tent took him
in to be their tent boy. He sang along to their country and western
records in between keeping the two wood stoves burning, cleaning
and washing clothes. In exchange for these chores, the boy got a
place to sleep and a steady diet of Army food _ relative luxuries
for a Korean refugee.
</P>
<P>
   Walters would show Kim home movies at night. His wife, Shirley,
sent them over a couple of times a month. And Walters would sit
with Kim and watch his little girl, Becky, grow up, one 8mm reel at
a time.
</P>
<P>
   The boy would ride with Walters around the air base in his Army
Jeep, which had ``Shirley'' and ``Becky'' painted on the
windshield's frame.
</P>
<P>
   Kim made Walters laugh. ``You'd come in (to the tent) and the
kid's singing damn country music and he can barely speak English,''
Walters remembered. ``He was just the cutest little guy you ever
saw. The longer he was there, we just bonded. He was like a son to
me, and he helped me get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim's wooden cot was placed next to Walters', and the boy
started calling him ``papa-san.'' Walters called Kim ``boy-san.''
</P>
<P>
   ``War time is very horrible,'' said Kim, now 58. ``I was alone.
That's why I depended on him, Mr. Walters. He raised me like a
daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Walters' year at war ended. In October 1953, he sailed back
home aboard the Gen. M.C. Meig. Eventually the letters stopped
traveling back and forth across the Pacific, and the two men lost
touch.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Kim found his parents and siblings. He eventually
married and raised two sons, and now he has three grandchildren.
Two decades ago, he moved his family to Minnesota to be near his
sister and her husband. He owns a delicatessen at the base of a
tall building in downtown St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Kim asked military men whether they knew a man
from the South whose first name was ``Lieutenant.'' Kim thought
Walters lived in Louisiana. ``I gave up a couple of years ago,'' he
said. ``I thought he passed away or he was too old.''
</P>
<P>
   Walters retired in 1989, after 38 years at Lockheed producing
hydraulic equipment. Now 72, he lives with Shirley in a one-story
house on a spacious, manicured lot in Forsyth County.
</P>
<P>
   A large photograph hangs in their kitchen. It shows them smiling
at their 50th wedding anniversary party last year, surrounded by
their four children, eight grandchildren and other loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Walters never forgot Kim. Whenever he would meet pilots from the
South Korean air force at Lockheed, he'd tell them about Kim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd ask them to look for him and let me know if they found
him. Nobody ever did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Walters eat regularly at the Golden Buddha restaurant in
Cumming. In December, a waitress there was headed to South Korea to
visit her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Walters took another shot in the dark. He gave her $100 and a
photograph of Kim as a college student, and she placed an ad in a
Korean newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, the Walters' telephone rang. It had been 45 years
since he left Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's Becky?'' the voice asked. It was Kim. A relative had
seen the ad and told him about it. A reunion was set up in Atlanta
for the following weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On the flight to Atlanta, Kim told his story to the flight
attendants and passengers around him. After the plane landed at
Hartsfield International Airport, women were getting off in tears.
</P>
<P>
   When he saw Walters, Kim fell to his knees, grabbed Walter's
ankles and cried, ``Papa-san! Papa-san!''
</P>
<P>
   Memories of the war still bother Kim. He has had trouble
sleeping after watching television footage of Kosovo, because it
``reminds me of Korea. Very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   But since his December reunion with Walters, with phone
conversations every week and a reunion in Minnesota last weekend,
Kim has started to tell his own family about the war experience
that for years was ``too sad'' to share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I've met him, I've told my story to my son, wife,
church people,'' Kim said. ``I found him. I can't hide my back
life. I told the truth. I told my whole story.''

STEPPING OUT OF MANDELA'S SHADOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ The ballroom, in one of Johannesburg's poshest
hotels, sparkled. A glittering crowd had assembled. It was late
1998, and South Africa's deputy president was launching a book of
his collected speeches. The patron who had financed publication
rose to introduce the author, and said, ``The most frequent
question I am asked is, `Who is this Thabo Mbeki?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki took the podium.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a student at Sussex University, he said, trying to
woo ``those lovely English female students,'' the response was
always the same: `` `But Thabo, we don't know you.' This even
though I had been in the same class as them for the past two years.
You see, this is a persisting problem.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 16, barring an upset at the polls that no one predicts,
Mbeki will step out of Nelson Mandela's shadow and become South
Africa's second post-apartheid president. But as much as Mandela is
known and loved, Mbeki is unknown, and sometimes feared.
</P>
<P>
   Observers hail him as the right man at the right time, a leader
as attuned to South Africa's social crisis as Mandela was to its
racial hatreds. Opponents regard him as a shrewd backroom operator
who tolerates no dissent. His confidants volunteer nothing, and
even those further removed choose their words carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a the perception that he is ruthless, but it is based
on a lot of speculation,'' said Mac Maharaj, who has worked with
Mbeki both in exile and in government. ``Mbeki is an extremely
passionate Africanist, in the continental rather than racial sense.
He is also very much a realist about the world in which we live. He
understands the global economy and the need to change the rules of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Thabo Mbeki is a formidable intellect, a carefully nurtured son
of the African National Congress, now the ruling party after
decades of fighting to bring down apartheid, a man who finds in
ancient Roman prose and modern poetry the soul of his renaissance
visions. His entire life has been a patient and painful understudy
for the office that now awaits him.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the barren Transkei village of Mbewuleni in 1942, the
second of four children, Mbeki had an early political education.
His parents were both teachers, which gave him rare access to
books, and he read voraciously. They were also communists, whose
sense of family and identity was based less on flesh and blood than
hard work and commitment to the struggle against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's mother ran a general store that also served as the
village post office. Since most people were illiterate, Thabo and
his siblings were called upon to read letters and write down the
dictated replies. From these the young boy learned the heavy toll
migrant labor takes on families whose men were drawn off to the
gold and mineral mines in distant Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Childhood was brief. Mbeki's father left to find work in distant
cities when he was 10 years old; Thabo and his older sister were
sent to different, faraway schools the same year. The family would
never reunite. By the time he was 20, Mbeki's student political
activities caught the apartheid state's watchful eye, and the ANC
sent him into exile for his safety.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, the course of Mbeki's life, even decisions about
whom and when he could wed, would be dictated by the ANC. He earned
two degrees, the latter a masters in economics, at Sussex
University in Britain, where he also developed a taste for John
Keats and Immanuel Kant. He received military training in Russia.
He then served in various diplomatic and political posts for the
ANC in London, Nigeria, Swaziland, and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's life on the front lines of the struggle placed him in
constant danger of assassination by the apartheid government.
``Thabo comes from the engine room of the antiapartheid movement,''
said Shadrack Gutto, a human rights professor at the University of
Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, who knew Mbeki in exile. ``He spent
decades in hostile conditions, living on the front line when the
enemy was kicking very hard. People had to demand loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after Mbeki fled into exile, his father was sentenced to
life in prison on Robben Island, along with Mandela and others
convicted of treason by the government. Before the Pretoria regime
lifted its ban on the ANC in 1990 and Mbeki could return to South
Africa, both his son, born when Thabo was just 16, and youngest
brother had disappeared while trying to make their own way to
safety in exile. They are presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   The personal price the Mbekis paid for their commitment was
evident on a rainy spring day in 1989 at the airport in Lusaka,
Zambia. Mbeki stood in row with his comrades on the tarmac watching
a group of aging men descend the steps of an aircraft. Among the
arrivals was Govan, Mbeki's father. It had been almost 30 years
since father and son had seen each other. ``As Thabo remained in
place, Govan . . . slowly went down the line of the official
welcoming party until he came to his son,'' wrote Adrian Hadland
and Jovial Rantao, two South African journalists, in their recent
book, ``The Life and Times of Thabo Mbeki.'' ``They shook hands and
hugged each other briefly. Govan then carried on.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mbeki remains an unknown to many, the leadership
transition from Mandela won't be abrupt: It has been underway since
1995. As deputy president, Mbeki has been the administrative chief
behind Mandela's ceremonial presidency, running the Cabinet and
writing every speech his boss has delivered in the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's inauguration will usher in a new phase in South African
politics. Mandela focused on reconciling the races through
forgiveness and a common understanding of the past. Mbeki, in a
speech before the National Assembly last May, expressed a radically
different view.
</P>
<P>
   He focused on ``the material conditions in our society which
have divided our country into two nations, the one black and the
other white,'' and said: ``What this throws up, inevitably, is the
question: `Are the relatively rich, who as a result of an apartheid
definition are white, prepared to underwrite the upliftment of the
poor, who as a result of an apartheid definition are black?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The ``two nations'' question frames the agenda Mbeki will
pursue. To avert instability, he will have to make good on promises
to improve the lives of the poor. As an economist, he understands
the need for careful management of the public purse. Two years ago,
he was the driving force behind a shift in Mandela's economic
policy from ambitious social spending to fiscal restraint. What the
government can't provide, he has argued, those who benefited from
apartheid must.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics has entered a new phase where the warm, fuzzy edges
have come off,'' said Steven Friedman, director of the Center for
Policy Studies in Johannesburg, describing the tone Mbeki has begun
to set.
</P>
<P>
   He is widely described an enigmatic mix of charm and cunning. In
the late 1980s and early 1990s, he played a crucial,
behind-the-scenes role in negotiations to end white power. He met
early Afrikaner emissaries sent to feel out the ANC in exile, and
charmed them with his pipe smoke and erudition. Back in South
Africa, he soothed the fears of right-wing whites and Zulu
nationalists who threatened to boycott the first all-race elections
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoys personal connections across the South African
landscape, from corporate boardrooms to the rural meeting houses of
traditional leaders. He also has international ties that Mandela
lacked, cultivated during his decades in exile and his term as
deputy president. Vice President Al Gore is one of his closest
overseas friends.
</P>
<P>
   But Mbeki is sensitive to criticism and combative with the
press. Under Mandela, he has already made moves to strengthen the
presidency and centralize control.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki set off alarms last October by leading an attempt, against
Mandela's wishes, to block the final report of the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, which investigated the abuses of the
apartheid era for more than two years. Mbeki objected to the
panel's conclusion that the liberation movement as well as the
white government had been guilty of gross human rights violations,
saying the ANC's conduct during the struggle cannot be weighed in
the same scale as the apartheid state's.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu and others again criticized Mbeki this
week, when he proposed legislation to exonerate the ANC and other
liberation groups.
</P>
<P>
   As he steps out from the background, crowds gather daily to
greet him in township stadiums across South Africa. After five
years of talk about reconciliation, the impoverished masses want
what has not yet come: houses, better schools, and above all, jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It is the job the ANC prepared him for. Mbeka is married but has
no living children; his work is his life. He lacks Mandela's human
touch, but policy is the measure of the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mbeki is stepping in at a favorable moment,'' said Mahmoud
Mamdani, a professor at the University of Cape Town. ``He is
stepping into a situation that will make the maximum use of his
talents.''

 &HT;    `Papa-san! Papa-san!' Nearly a half-century ago, an American

   Life inside the army tent was cold and remote for John Walters.
The pair of wood-burning stoves were no match for the freezing
winds that blew down from China at night. His wife and baby girl
back in Atlanta seemed a million miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Outside there were men dying in icy darkness and mothers
starving in snow-covered street gutters and refugee children trying

A NEUTRAL FEW, ULSTER JEWS IN UNIQUE SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ It's a joke every Belfast Jew knows, and tells,
because it's so telling about Jews' status here.
</P>
<P>
   You're approached on the street and asked what religion you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm Jewish,'' you reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah yes,'' the inquisitor says, ``but are you a Catholic Jew or
a Protestant Jew?''
</P>
<P>
   In a land where nearly everyone has been compelled to choose
sides, it's only natural that Belfast Jews would, too. But the tiny
Jewish community has stayed neutral. Determinedly so, at least as
far as the congregation as a whole is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   With precisely the result intended: Jews have earned the respect
of both sides in the sectarian battles, or at least they've escaped
their enmity, an impressive achievement for a people who in so many
nations have been a lightning rod for vilification and violence.
</P>
<P>
   It's partly their even-handedness. Small numbers also make it
easier to stay on the sidelines. And the Jewish community has a
warm relationship with the Catholic cardinal at the same time that
leading Protestants, especially evangelical ones, feel an affinity
with the Old Testament's chosen people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably been less anti-Semitism in Northern Ireland
than in most other places,'' says Ronnie Appleton, president of the
congregation and former Chief Crown Prosecutor, a posting that saw
him go after terrorists from both camps.
</P>
<P>
   And Jews have used their neutrality to bridge gaps, especially
at the start of the Troubles in the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The premises of the synagogue were practically the only safe
meeting point in the whole of North Belfast for opposing
factions,'' recalls Cyril Rosenberg, a long-time Jewish leader.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Jews haven't been touched by the Troubles.
</P>
<P>
   One was killed, another wounded, and several were attacked
during 30 years of violence. But those incidents stemmed from being
in the wrong place at the wrong time, or in businesses where their
money made them easy targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true to say that the Jews have largely remained outside
the conflict,'' says Marie Smyth, who runs a research group that
studies the human and other costs of the strife.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jewish roots in Northern Ireland run deep and strong, even if
the notion of an Irish Jew seems an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   The first arrived from Germany in the 1840s, while descendants
of most of today's Northern Ireland Jews came 50 years later from
Russia, fleeing deadly pogroms. They were poor, couldn't speak
English, but founded a mainly Orthodox community that over time
sponsored everything from a social club and dance hall to tennis
courts, football fields, burial grounds, and a synagogue that held
hundreds. They also influenced the wider community, providing it
with doctors and dentists, lawyers, merchants, and now, a lord
mayor of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   At its height in the early 1970s, the Jewish community here
numbered 1,500, with most living in north Belfast. Today barely 250
remain, so few that the community has sold social halls,
partitioned its synagogue, and struggles to get the 10 men needed
for a religious service.
</P>
<P>
   The decline was due largely to young Jews leaving for England,
Israel, or the United States in search of spouses, or broader
educational and professional opportunities. The Troubles also were
a factor, limiting the chance for Jews, as for everyone, to safely
congregate and raising doubts about the future.
</P>
<P>
   What about the Jewish community's future?
</P>
<P>
   Most here are pessimistic, barring an infusion of Jewish
immigrants fleeing oppression or seeking economic opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``But how many will that be?'' asks Rosenberg, a retired
jeweler. ``And they have got to be young, married people who will
produce families. We don't need any more old people or even
middle-aged ones.''

WHERE PORK IS KING, THEY DON'T KNOW BEANS ABOUT MAINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's capital, which already has the White
House, the Chinese pandas, and the House Republican managers, is
about to get its own trout stream. Inside. At a shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   L.L. Bean, the venerable Freeport, Maine, purveyor of hunting
boots and chamois shirts, is coming to a mall just a few miles
outside the Washington city line. The 75,000 square foot store
planned for Tysons Corner, Va., will be the beginning of a chain of
Bean stores across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, you say: More evidence of the homogenization of America.
Except for one thing: Even with regional differences seeping out of
American culture, it would be impossible to make Washington
anything like Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Here the preeminent outdoor sport is hiking over to the
Government Printing Office to pick up early copies of the
President's Budget Message to Congress. Here the most treacherous,
winding trail leads from the third floor of the Senate side of the
Capitol to the third floor of the House side of the Capitol. Here
big-game hunting is done by fund-raisers employed by the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Maine Hiking Shoe that Leon Leonwood Bean advertised for
$2.85 (postpaid) in Hunter-Trapper-Trader magazine in 1929 is all
but unknown here; this is the land of a different sort of footwear.
During a late-night tax markup session in the mid 1980s, anxious
lobbyists paced in front of the closed doors of the Senate Finance
Committee hearing room. Senator Bob Dole, at the time the Finance
chairman, was told that the lobbyists were Gucci-to-Gucci in the
hallways (although he allowed as to how they would be barefoot in
the morning).
</P>
<P>
   In my 20 years in exile from New England I have seen with my own
eyes Washingtonians walking on mountain trails in beach
flip-flopssweatshirts;; Washingtonians flopping down demanding ski
trails in the freeze of mid February wearing Florida State
sweatshirts; Washingtonians passing a beautiful spring picnic
afternoon talking about community development block grants;
Washingtonians sitting at the shore with their briefcases;
Washingtonians paying $10 a pound in a grocery store for the most
pitiful, listless lobsters you have ever seen; Washingtonians who
have no moxie and never have tasted Moxie; Washingtonians who think
that a clam roll consists of scrawny little clam necks stuffed in
an untoasted bun.
</P>
<P>
   So before L.L. Bean plants its store in Tysons Corner, it ought
to know the following things about Washington:
</P>
<P>
   1. Thrift is not embraced in Washington, as it is in Maine. L.L.
Bean himself once crusaded for the flinty values that the nation
now celebrates only in nostaligia. ``We wish to call your attention
to the fact that throwing away a pair of used Maine Hunting Shoes
is about the same as throwing away a $5 bill,'' he once wrote,
asking customers to send their old shoes back to Freeport to be
rebuilt. Washington, on the other hand, is the city where the
deficit blossomed, and where the budget surplus that followed was
marked by a remarkable burst of feeding at the troughs by the
porkmeisters of Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   2. The greatest of all New England values, the reluctance to pop
off about something you know nothing about, is not honored here. At
any hour Capitol Hill is full of experts on subjects they have
hardly ever encountered. Representative Perkins Bass, a Republican
who represented the western congressional district in New Hampshire
between 1955 and 1963, was known as Small-Mouth Bass. (His son, who
has represented the same district since 1995, is no talkaholic
either.) Advice to human resources coordinator for the Tysons
Corner Store: Taciturn Maine salespeople will not do. Find a
filibusterer. The locals love a talker.
</P>
<P>
   3. There are no seasons here, at least not like the ones there
are in Maine. But there is election season, and for that the
preferred attire is the blue Oxford-cloth shirt and the red tie. No
one who has ever worn anything remotely like the short-sleeve
hibiscus floral shirt on page 32 of the current cataloghas ever
been sighted in the Speaker's Lobby. Sad but true.
</P>
<P>
   4. It does not snow here, at least not like it does in Maine.
Last March the local authorities closed the public schools in the
District of Columbia after the area was hit by the icy blast of
winter and huge amounts of snowfalls, with drifts approaching
three-quarters of an inch in my backyard. In Maine they say that
``the snow of winter did lie very long upon the ground.'' Here the
``snow'' of ``winter'' lasts for but a few hours. No need here for
snowshoes, except maybe on the wall of a bar, where they might be
mistaken for old tennis rackets.
</P>
<P>
   5. People do not stir here in summer, at least not like they do
in Maine. In his famous elegy to a lifetime of lake summers in
Maine, E.B. White wrote: ``Summertime, oh, summertime, pattern of
life indelible, the fade-proof lake, the woods unshatterable, the
pasture with the sweetfern and the juniper forever and ever, summer
without end.'' Even if a writer of White's read lived here (and
none would), he would never write a sentence like that.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington summer is a lot like a sauna without a shower.
James Russell Wiggins, who was managing editor and editor of The
Washington Post, abandoned the game of tennis and just about
anything else outdoors when he came here. ``When I moved to
Washington I quit doing things outdoors,'' said Wiggins. ``It was
too damn hot.'' Wiggins, who at 95 now edits The Ellsworth American
(circulation 12,000) in Ellsworth, Maine, has a theory that might
explain Bean's marketing strategy: ``Maybe,'' he told me, ``they're
appealing to the people in Washington who are planning to move up
here, to Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   6. Geography and geology have conspired to make the Washington
area recreation-free, and not at all like Maine. It is possible to
get to decent mountains from Washington. It takes four hours. It is
possible to get to a decent beach from Washington. It takes three
hours. This is one explanation for why Washingtonians are so
severe.
</P>
<P>
   For years an L.L. Bean catalog cover has hung in my home. It was
produced in fall 1933, and it is mostly blue, like the times. In
the background is a dog, and in the foreground is a hunter with a
long rifle standing in knee-high boots in the snow. This man has
never been to a food court. This man has never consumed homemade
pasta with spinach, mortadella ham and three cheeses baked in a
cream sauce, nor has he ever dipped his freshly caught fish in a
Parmesean egg batter, flash-fried it, topped it with hollandaise,
and plopped it on a plate with bliss potatoes. (These are actual
menu items from the best-known pub in Tysons Corner, a rifle shot
from the very spot where L.L. Bean will be located.)
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday night I was paddling a canoe on Great Pond in
Rome, Maine. The breeze was brisk, the sky clear. There was an
osprey nest in the tree on the big island. The ducks paddled
quietly. The blue flag of Maine flapped from a pole on the shore.
The water was cool, a hint of March mixing with the reality of May.
It was a real Maine moment, ``under the silent spruces,'' as Edna
St. Vincent Millay wrote in her Maine poetry, ``where the wide,
quiet evening darkens without haste.''
</P>
<P>
   For that Maine moment I felt far from my worries, from my
obligations _ and from the mall.
</P>

INDICTMENT OF MILOSEVIC TO TEST NATO'S WILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELIZABETH NEUFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic, indicted at last. More than a decade after
the Serbian strongman incited a campaign of poisonous nationalism
that fanned deadly conflicts across the Balkans, he and four of his
top aides were charged last week by the International Criminal
Tribunal in The Hague with war crimes, including murder.
</P>
<P>
   But indicting Milosevic for atrocities in the Yugoslavian
province of Kosovo and actually bringing him to the dock are two
different things. The next few months will be a critical test of
whether NATO's political leaders are as serious about bringing war
criminals to justice as they have claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Should the North Atlantic Treaty Organization fail to do all it
can to help the tribunal bring Milosevic to trial _ including
providing key intelligence, or acting on the arrest warrants that
accompanied the indictment _ it will cement the tribunal's
reputation as powerless, and underscore how feckless are the
political leaders in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the war crimes tribunal, created by the United
Nations Security Council in 1993, is independent from NATO, which
can have no influence over whom the tribunal indicts. But in
practice, the tribunal relies on governments to enforce its
actions. In the Balkans, where countries refuse to cooperate, that
means the job falls to NATO. It, after all, has a military presence
on the ground _ and there's no one else to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Yet NATO's reactions to the indictment were mixed. Despite the
condemnation of Milosevic that has poured out of the US and
European capitals in recent weeks, many diplomats have made it
clear they fear the indictment will imperil, if not sink, ongoing
efforts to devise a peaceful halt to the Kosovo conflict. Before
the indictment had even been announced, French Interior Minister
Jean-Pierre Chevenement had slammed it as ``counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the tricky issues raised by the fact that the
Yugoslav president is the first sitting head of state ever to be
indicted for war crimes. Can you negotiate with an indicted war
criminal? Only British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook immediately
brushed aside concerns. Even though Milosevic has been indicted,
Cook said, it would be ``irresponsible'' of NATO not to press him
for a peace settlement in Kosovo as long as he remains in power.
Cook also vowed that such negotiations would not include a promise
of amnesty for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent: Diplomats met with former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic after his indictment for genocide. But this
nonetheless remains a troubling issue for many in NATO, who are
uneasy negotiating with a man who is now officially branded an
international criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Arbour, the tribunal's top prosecutor, says as much, but
the idea troubles her for a slightly different reason. The
tribunal's evidence raises questions about Milosevic's ``suitablity
to be the guarantors of any deal, let alone a peace agreement,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The key question now is how far NATO is willing to go to ensure
that Milosevic is actually brought to trial. Several problems
emerge, among them NATO's continuing concern about turning over key
intelligence to prosecutors, and its failure so far to arrest war
criminals in the Balkans. Both are critical to what happens next.
</P>
<P>
   The latter issue is the most troubling. NATO's own track record
reveals its utter lack of commitment: Of the 84 persons publicly
indicted for crimes in Bosnia, only 25 are in custody, and many of
those surrendered voluntarily. Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic
remain at large, despite their indictments for genocide. Many feel
their arrests would have prevented the tragedies of Kosovo from
occurring in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had arrested Karadzic, then Milosevic would have known
what his future would be,'' said Blerim Shala, editor of the Kosovo
weekly Zeri. ``He'd know the West wasn't just making a statement on
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   But will NATO arrest Milosevic, and failing that, at least
arrest Karadzic, who could link Milosevic to war crimes in Bosnia?
(The indictment charges him only for war crimes in Kosovo, much to
the distress of many Bosnians.)
</P>
<P>
   Given NATO's track record, no one believes Milosevic's arrest
will be swift. ``I don't think anybody expects NATO troops to go
searching for Milosevic in Belgrade,'' said Reed Brody, advocacy
director of Human Rights Watch, ``but these crimes have no statute
of limitations, and 15 years from now, Milosevic will still be
under indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   Should NATO troops ever enter Kosovo, or Serbia, it's also
important to avert the kind of farce that occurred in Bosnia, where
NATO troops avoided Karadzic so as not to have to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   NATO should make clear that it takes seriously not only the
arrest of Milosevic, but also of his indicted henchmen: Milan
Milutinovic, president of the Republic of Serbia; Nikola Sainovic,
deputy prime minister of the federal Republic of Serbia; Dragoljub
Ojdanic, chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces; and Vlajko
Stojiljkovic, minister of interior affairs.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot afford to repeat the indifference it exhibited to the
last important indictment unveiled against an alleged war criminal:
Zeljko Raznjatovic, otherwise known as Arkan. NATO was silent even
as the brazen Arkan appeared on CNN and network television.
</P>
<P>
   It's also vital that NATO continue to supply the tribunal with
key intelligence. Notably, the indictment against Milosevic _ for
crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and customs of
war _ charges him with personal criminal responsibility. This is
good news; it means NATO leaders, who have made a show of turning
over evidence, must have given the tribunal something to directly
link Milosevic and his underlings with the crimes. Those familiar
with Milosevic's habits say he rarely leaves an incriminating paper
trail, doesn't use the telephone, and issues no written directives.
</P>
<P>
   Every shred of evidence will be needed to make the case, should
it ever come to trial. Legal experts and those familiar with
Milosevic say it will not be easy. In addition to individual
criminal responsibility, Milosevic is also charged in the
indictment with responsibility for crimes committed by those he
oversees, under a strategy known as ``command responsibility,'' a
legal theory not raised since Nuremberg.
</P>
<P>
   The theory _ under which leaders can be charged not only with
ordering their subordinates to do something, but also with failing
to halt a crime or punish those who commit them _ has been used in
several cases at The Hague. But prosecutors have had mixed success
in proving it to the tribunal judges' satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   In one key case last year, the first to put Bosnian Muslims on
trial for war crimes committed against camp prisoners, judges
acquitted the overall military commander. They said that while he
may have had responsibility for the camp, prosecutors did not prove
he was responsible for his subordinates' actions.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say that means future prosecutors will have to
prove a commander's complicity, not just argue he is automatically
responsible for crimes committed by his subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   That means NATO governments will have to be willing to turn over
everything _ from telephone intercepts to other forms of
intelligence _ to ensure Milosevic and the others indicted are
directly linked to their subordinates' crimes. That's what it will
take to counter efforts by this master manipulator.
</P>
<P>
   To escape prosecution, Milosevic is likely to ``come up with
some concocted memo that orders all the refugees to be treated
humanely,'' predicted Terree Bowers, an assistant US attorney in
Los Angeles, who worked as a prosecutor in The Hague. ``Karadzic
attempted to do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's indictment alone sends the message that no one is
above the law, but it does not yet send the message that those who
commit atrocities will be punished. As the former head of the
tribunal, Richard Goldstone, put it: ``It's second prize, but it's
better than nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The question for NATO _ and all of us _ is whether second prize
is what we want.

`NO ILLUSIONS' WITH COX REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Two Republican congressmen. Two similar jobs _
running a deadly serious investigation. Two similar mandates _ from
some guy named Gingrich who used to work around here. And two very
different outcomes: For Henry Hyde of the Judiciary, there was
political disaster masquerading on its best days as farce in the
impeachment proceeding against President Clinton; for Chris Cox of
California and his special committee investigating China's
acquisition of American nuclear secrets, there was bipartisan
success and deserved applause from most corners of the political
and policy world.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident. Anything big around here gets done in a
bipartisan manner or it simply doesn't get done in this period of
bitter politics. Bipartisanship, however, is not a mood, it's the
result of hard work and give and take.
</P>
<P>
   In impeachment, what was available was official, stern
condemnation of the president's behavior in return for dropping an
effort to remove him. In the case of the Cox Commission, the
decision to come together was limited to two major points: a focus
on the glaring deficiencies in the counter-intelligence systems
that are supposed to protect national security information hasn't
been getting protection for more than 20 years; and a worst-case
description of China's nuclear potential as a result of its having
obtained nuclear weapons data _ especially about warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The result was genuine progress, at the legitimate price of
intentionally steering away from matters that would have produced
division. Grown-ups will take that deal nearly every time.
</P>
<P>
   It's important, however, not to ignore the areas where the Cox
report avoided conclusions. A good example is the odd and murky
tale of how, beginning four years ago, the US first became aware
that China was in possession of gobs of material it could only have
obtained by hook, if not by crook.
</P>
<P>
   In cursory form, the committee report confirms that in 1995 a
Chinese person approached US officials (there are indications it
was on Taiwan but that has yet to be confirmed) bearing classified
documents, offering more, and looking for spy work.Included in the
person's deliveries was a military document running at least a few
hundred pages on China's nuclear weapons program. And inside that
document was data that the Chinese intelligence agencies had
gathered about American warheads, especially the most advanced, the
W-88. The 11-year-old document is central to what is known about
what China knows; without it, the Cox Committee report would have
been a Sominex pill.
</P>
<P>
   There's a catch, however. While this person was making his
deliveries, the report says the US intelligence community came to
the firm conclusion that he was what the spooks call a ``directed
walk-in'' _ or a double-agent, or a Chinese agent working for
Beijing all along.
</P>
<P>
   This raises the most basic of questions about the whole affair,
none of which are dealt with, much less answered in the report.
Just consider the most plausible explanations:
</P>
<P>
   1. A simple screw-up, with the agent in possession of something
his superiors had either not reviewed carefully or didn't
understand would be explosive. It's convenient but hard to accept,
though screwing up is something most intelligence agencies are
adept at.
</P>
<P>
   2. The document was actually written much later but back-dated
to 1988 to protect its source. Interesting, but it doesn't explain
why the super-sensitive information was given to the US.
</P>
<P>
   3. Because the material was being shared with Taiwan, it could
have been a warning to the land China covets, advertising the
mainland's power and potential to further intimidate.
</P>
<P>
   4. It could have been a direct signal to the US, not so much to
intimidate as to make China's military potential more of a chip in
the multitude of ongoing talks that characterize our complicated
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Again, nobody knows for sure, but it is obvious from this one
nugget how much more important the future is than an endless
shouting match here over how much each of the last four presidents
knew or didn't know, did or didn't do.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that China has yet to modernize a primitive
intercontinental nuclear force that currently consists of about two
dozen single-warhead missiles stuck in silos. It is also clear that
China has yet to decide whether to embark on what for a still-poor
country could be a ruinously expensive and diverting fool's errand.
</P>
<P>
   That is why jumping to conclusions on a partisan basis could be
dangerous. That is also why none of the reactions to the Cox report
was more perplexing than that of Texas Gov. George Bush, who
denounced our current relationship of ``strategic partnership
without illusions'' with China that goes back to Richard Nixon's
famous visit more than 27 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to breaking with his father, Bush's use of the word
``competitor'' to describe China was dangerous, offering the
prospect of tension and instability on the basis of no hard
evidence. As a bipartisan success, the report is raising our guard
here and strengthening the attitude of ``no illusions.'' Beyond
that, however, lies silly scapegoating and irresponsibility about a
country much too dynamic and large for Cold War stereotypes.

ONE MAYOR'S DISSENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
The place: A city hall press room 
The time: Now 
The city: Not this one, alas 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (ital) Mr. Mayor, now that Los Angeles, San Francisco, and
Boston have decided to sue gun manufacturers, are you going to do
likewise? (unital) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No. As I said last fall when New Orleans and Chicago first set
this bandwagon rolling, these lawsuits are misguided. The reason we
have judges and juries is to effect justice, and there is nothing
just about punishing gun makers for lawful sales of a legal
product. The chief of special litigation in San Francisco describes
his city's lawsuit as being grounded in a law ``that reaches all
sort of conduct that might not be technically illegal.'' Well, this
city is not going to play that game. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (ital) But shouldn't gun manufacturers be held liable when their
products are used to commit crimes? (unital)  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Look, if we head down that road, there'll be no turning back.
We'' have to hold Ford and Toyota liable because some of their
products are driven recklessly and cause fatal car crashes. We'll
have to sue IBM and Compaq because some computer users maliciously
crack government or corporate databases? (ital) Any (unital)
product can be used unlawfully. Our wrath should be directed at the
criminal, not the manufacturer whose useful product was wrongly
misused. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (ital) `Useful product'?! How can you talk about guns that way,
especially after Littleton? (unital) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Please, spare me the histrionics. Guns are an extraordinarily
useful product, which is why tens of millions of Americans _
including many thousands of residents of this city _ own them. What
happened in Littleton was a horror. (ital) Every (unital) murder is
a horror. But using a gun to commit a crime is aberrant. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (ital) Hello? Mr. Mayor, there are 450,000 gun-related crimes a
year in this country. You call that `aberrant?' (unital) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I do when there are 240 million civilian-owned guns. On average,
how many crimes would you say a criminal gets out of one gun? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (ital) How would I know? I'm a journalist. (unital) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Make an estimate. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (ital) Mmm _ three. (unital) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fine. Sounds reasonable. Three crimes per gun means that 150,000
guns _ out of 240 million _ are used criminally each year. That's
six-100ths of 1 percent. I'm not a statistician, but in my book,
0.06 percent is an aberration. If it's only two crimes per gun, the
percentage is still just 0.09. In any given year, 99.9 percent of
guns in America are (ital) not (unital) used for crimes. So how can
the Chicago lawsuit _ and some of the others, like Boston's _ argue
in good faith that gun companies are marketing and distributing
weapons so that they'll end up in criminals' hands? The crooks'
share of the market is too microscopic to bother with. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (ital) Well, what about the product-liability theory _ gun
makers are selling weapons that are patently unsafe. They don't
incorporate safety features like trigger locks, and the result is
more gun deaths. (unital) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the result has been fewer gun deaths. Haven't you
heard? Murder and violent crime are down almost everywhere,
especially in big cities. Accidental gun fatalities have been
dropping for decades, even as the population and the number of guns
has gone up. John Lott at the University of Chicago Law School has
pulled together all kinds of data proving that the states with the
largest increases in gun ownership have posted the largest declines
in violent crime. Patently unsafe? I'd say guns are safer than
ever. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (ital) Yeah, right. Tell that to the parents in Littleton.
(unital) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Again with the (ital) reductio ad Littleton? (unital) Listen,
this is not a difficult concept: The fact that guns were used to
perpetrate an atrocity does not negate the fact that guns are far
more likely to be a blessing than a curse. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (ital) Come again? (unital) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let me read you something written by Lott, the University of
Chicago fellow: ``There are 15 national surveys that have been
conducted by academics as well as polling organizations like the
Los Angeles Times and Gallup, and their average estimate indicates
that people use guns defensively well over 2 million times each
year. My own survey put the defensive uses at about 2.1 million in
1997.'' Okay? Crimes involving guns _ 450,000. Crimes prevented by
guns _ 2 million. Blessing outweighs curse, 5 to 1. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (unital) With or without you, Mr. Mayor _ these lawsuits are
going forward. And if the tobacco litigation is any guide, there's
apt to be a big pot of money at the end. Can our city really afford
to deal itself out of the game? (unital) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ah. At last we get to the real issue: Money. Tom Cochran _ you
know, the executive director of the US Conference of Mayors _ put
his finger on it last December. ``The lawyers are seeing green on
this issue.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (ital) Don't you have a fiduciary obligation to the people to
get as much of that green for the city as you can? (unital) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No. I have a moral obligation to them to conduct myself at all
times responsibly and with integrity. As long as I am mayor, this
city is not going to use the courts to extort money out of
industries that have not broken the law. People who wish to impose
restrictions on the design, manufacture, or sale of guns should
address their concerns to the City Council and the Legislature. The
honest way to change public policy is through debate and
legislation _ not litigation. Other mayors may be willing to
subvert the democratic process. I won't be a part of it.

N.H. VOTE ON KING HOLIDAY REVEALS A CHANGED STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ New Hampshire last week finally became the 50th state
to make the birthday of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. a
state holiday. Now the question is whether the social change that
led to that decision will influence the 2000 presidential
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt that, over the years, the great influx of residents
from Massachusetts into southern New Hampshire has influenced the
outcome of statewide elections _ such as that of Democrat Jeanne
Shaheen to the governor's office in 1998. And, for the first time
in 100 years, Democrats have taken control of the New Hampshire
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   While some political strategists believe New Hampshire remains
more conservative than other states, the steady change in its
social landscape may well favor Democrats in the primary and
presidential votes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic primary, Vice President Al Gore stands to gain
more than Bill Bradley, the former US senator from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The views of both candidates reflect the thinking of the people
behind the successful campaign to have a King holiday in the state.
What bodes well for Gore is that President Clinton, Gore's biggest
backer, has also fared well there. He can presumably pass some of
that strength on to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire's changing political and social landscape may, in
the end, work against the expected GOP nominee, George W. Bush _
even though polls now show Bush thrashing Gore. A more realistic
measurement of Bush's popularity in the Granite State will come
after he faces media scrutiny as he campaigns there.
</P>
<P>
   How well Bush does in fielding reporters' questions about any
problems in his past may determine how well he does with New
Hampshire's evolving electorate.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, winning New Hampshire is crucial to his survival as
a presidential hopeful next year, even if he were to win Iowa.
Gore, on the other hand, can afford to lose both primaries and
still be able to win the nomination. But he also risks losing
important momentum to Bradley if Bradley comes out on top in the
Granite State.
</P>
<P>
   Some political pundits might suggest that New Hampshire has not
changed all that much in recent years, and they point to the fact
that, in 1996, the GOP's right-wing candidate, Patrick Buchanan,
won the state's Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   But what helped Buchanan was not his philosophy, but his message
about the status of the nation's workers, and their risk of losing
their jobs as companies moved out of the country. That hit home
with New Hampshire voters _ many of the same voters who supported
the Legislature's decision last week to make the national holiday
honoring King also a state holiday. The House passed the measure by
a comfortable 212 to 148.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Shaheen's expected signing of both a House and Senate
version of the legislation shows that both chambers want to claim
some credit for its passage. That's far different from only a few
years ago, when neither wanted to go near the bill.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt both Gore and Bradley, as well as the GOP candidates
Bush and Elizabeth Dole, will embrace the King holiday bill. But
Gore, while he may benefit from New Hampshire's changing political
climate, may have other obstacles to overcome. He may have a
problem that is as far away from New Hampshire as China _ with the
Republicans still pursuing the Democrats' fund-raising involving
Chinese interests.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP is also pursuing the recent disclosure of China's
stealing enough secrets during the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton
administrations to acquire a nuclear arsenal that rivals the United
States'.
</P>
<P>
   Since Gore is part of the Clinton administration, these issues
could hurt him as much, if not more, than the changing New
Hampshire political and social landscape could help. Gore's job, if
he is to deflect these controversies, is to find a way to have
voters accept him as one of their own during the primary.
</P>
<P>
   But even after New Hampshire's historic vote to embrace the King
holiday, making Gore blend into the state's political landscape may
be an even higher mountain to climb.

AUSTRIA EASES PLIGHT OF THE EXILED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA _ It is Friday night in Espresso Bihac, a cafe in a
cellar in a poor quarter of the Austrian capital, and 30
middle-aged guys, just finished with a hearty meal of boiled and
baked calves' heads, are belting out Bosnian folk tunes to the
accompaniment of accordion, guitar, and homemade white lightning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wind, wind, you should blow from the Neretva, so the fog will
be dispersed from over Mostar,'' they sing, in poignant allusion to
a beautiful river and city in a homeland lost. A portrait of
Bosnian President Alia Izetbegovic hangs on the wall. Photos of the
Bihac soccer squad, one of eight teams in the Bosnian League of
Austria, line the sides of the room.
</P>
<P>
   Much can be learned in this room, and in dozens of other small,
ethnically oriented cafes around the city, about realities of the
Balkan wars seldom appreciated by Americans: That Austria is
setting a new standard in humane treatment of refugees; that few of
the million-plus Bosnians still in exile will ever return to their
pre-war homes; that NATO nations had best study the Bosnian
experience if they expect to do better with the million new
refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The need to cope is pressing.
</P>
<P>
   Only about a third of the 95,000 Bosnian refugees who received
asylum in Austria have gone back since the Bosnian war ended in
late 1995. An estimated 60,000 have been integrated into Austrian
society. But the same cannot be said of other European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, which received 200,000 Bosnians, has been pushing them
out steadily; only a quiet transfer of these Bosnians to the United
States has kept the Germans from forcing them back to the Balkans,
US sources say. Such a step would have put an ugly blot on the
humanitarian role in which the West is casting itself in the former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   And the Kosovars are coming.
</P>
<P>
   In Espresso Bihac, named for the town from which most of the
patrons hail, the men's shirts bulge with muscle. Some came
straight from their jobs, still wearing the dark blue coveralls and
white T-shirts of construction workers. One breaks into a chant _
``NATO! NATO! NATO is a god!'' _ then segues into uproarious,
affectionate impersonations of Bosnia's neighbors in Albania and
Montenegro. No one speaks of the Serbs, the neighbors who drove
them from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Sead Kovacevic, the owner, who emigrated to Austria decades
before Yugoslavia disintegrated, sits at a back table, beaming. ``I
opened this club when the war broke out to keep people together,''
he says, well pleased with his success. But his children, and those
of many newcomers, are citizens of Austria. Many speak better
German than Serbo-Croatian. And does Kovacevic still think of going
back? ``Not really.''
</P>
<P>
   More-recent arrivals are hesitant to go that far. It smacks of
disloyalty. But they are being pushed in that direction. The reason
_ and the lesson of their experience for Western countries striving
to defeat ethnic cleansing in the Balkans _ is that the refugees
are making decisions based on their children's needs more than on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Azra Merdzan, who fled Sarajevo with her daughter and son when
Serb forces began shelling the city in April 1992, was one of many
Bosnians who, trying to stay close to home in the hope the war
would be brief, initially took refuge in Croatia. That August, she
took ship for Austria because ``the kids had to go to school, and
there was no school for them in Croatia.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman from a well-to-do family with credentials as a social
worker and teacher, Merdzan labored days as a housekeeper, studied
German at night, and eventually was able to work as a professional
again. The roses she brought to dinner last week, she said happily,
were from an Albanian man she helped with his work permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bosnia is something like a love you cannot forget, but which
you have lost,'' said Merdzan, who is 46. ``I am satisfied with my
life. I had it so hard, and now I have a home in this country where
I keep alive the good memory and talk to my kids of the Bosnia I
used to know. But that Bosnia, and the life I had before the war,
can never be again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein Hasic, 38, had just invested in new machinery for his
woodworking company in Brcko when the fighting started, and wanted
to hang in for a while. His mother, he says, told him no, ``you
have to leave, you have to save the children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to go back, but my kids are 16 and 10 now, and
they are fully integrated,'' he said over Turkish coffees in
another cafe. ``The only memory my older daughter has is the dog
she had there. To the younger, Bosnia is only a word. For me, and
for my brother'' _ who recently relocated, under strong pressure,
from Germany to the United States _ ``this is all about our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Rohan, secretary general of the Austrian Foreign Ministry
and a longtime Balkans specialist, said ``there is not a prayer''
people like these will go back, nor do the Austrians want that.
``We are quite happy about the experience. . . . Their young people
have become Austrians.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the efforts of Jorg Haidar's Freedom Party to mount an
anti-immigrant platform, Austrians generally have treated the
Bosnians with great generosity.
</P>
<P>
   Hasic, his wife, and their daughters were taken in by an
Austrian family with whom they lived for their first three years in
the country. The family helped them get work permits, good medical
care, and the best schools for the children. They bought them
clothes, lent them money.
</P>
<P>
   ``A brother wouldn't do as much,'' Hasic said. ``I felt like I
was in my own house. I still have a key. We spend holidays
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Many refugees had a harder time, but such experiences are not
rare. Austria's reputation in the West was blackened by the
country's embrace of Nazi Germany, but it had a long history as a
tolerant, multiethnic society both before World War II, when the
policies of the Austro-Hungarian empire helped make Sarajevo a
multicultural wonderland, and after, when Hungarians, Poles,
Czechs, and Jews fleeing Soviet oppression all found support here.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary response to the Balkan crises is not limited
to helping refugees inside Austria. Neighbor in Need, a partnership
of the national broadcasting company, the Red Cross, and Caritas,
raised $100 million over three years for assistance to people
displaced by the Bosnian wars, with much of the money coming in
from schoolchildren, social clubs, and church groups. The initial
response to the Kosovo crisis has been even greater, with $40
million raised since Easter.
</P>
<P>
   It is a Globe Santa-like effort, with newspapers regularly
featuring photos of politicians, schoolchildren, and corporate
executives donating checks and sending off trucks loaded with food
and medicine. Per capita, the Austrians are giving far more than
Americans or Germans.
</P>
<P>
   However, says Bruno Kapfer, a legal counselor with Caritas of
Austria, the willingness to accept refugees from Kosovo is
substantially less than existed for the Bosnians, and integration
into Austrian society is not an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kosovar Albanians are protected until the end of December,
but if the situation in Kosovo changes they lose their right to
stay in Austria,'' Kapfer said. ``It is official.''
</P>
<P>
   The government says it will give refuge to up to 10,000 Kosovar
Albanians, but the initial quota of 5,000 has not been filled, even
though Austria would be the easier country to which they could be
relocated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the Germans and we feel that if there is solidarity in
the European Community, it should extend to burden-sharing,'' Rohan
said, ``but many countries did not take any'' of the Bosnia war
exiles. As a result, he said, Austria feels ``you can only start
burden-sharing if you limit your own intake, to force the others to
do their share.''
</P>
<P>
   As for allowing, even assisting, refugees to integrate into
Austrian society, he said this has not been ruled out. ``In Bosnia,
we knew from the beginning it would take many years'' before there
was a possibility of return. ``In Kosovo, we still cling to the
hope that it can be resolved soon.''

TREAT THE BOSS'S PC LIKE YOUR OWN _ AND GET CAUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The personal computer is an indispensable tool in the workplace.
But don't be fooled: It may be personal, but it's not private.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Thiemann thought it was. We now find out his resignation
in November as dean of Harvard Divinity School was prompted by
university techies' discovery of pornography on the Harvard-issued
PC in his Harvard-owned home.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight employees of the St. Louis-based Edward Jones &AMP; Co.
brokerage thought their PCs were private _ before they were
disciplined last month for sending e-mail that contained either
pornography or dirty jokes. Another 19 employees at Edward Jones _
ranked the 11th best company in America to work for earlier this
year by Fortune magazine _ were dismissed on April 29.
</P>
<P>
   The company, with 17,000 employees worldwide, has been inundated
with requests from other businesses for information on its
electronic usage policies and what types of programs were used to
uncover the offending employees.
</P>
<P>
   While politicians focus on protecting privacy rights on the
Internet _ ensuring, for example, that no one steals your credit
card number when you shop at amazon.com _ the real advance in
cyber-surveillance is in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are spying eyes everywhere, but by far the person most
likely to be spying on you is your boss,'' says Lewis Maltby,
director of the American Civil Liberties Union's workplace rights
office.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven percent of businesses surveyed by the American
Management Association said they review employee e-mail, up from 20
percent in the 1998 survey. What employees may find especially
discomfiting is this: The majority of e-mail ``screens'' are done
without any provocation by the worker, such as a complaint to
management. They are totally random.
</P>
<P>
   And bosses are perfectly free to check up on employees' on-line
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general rule with respect to the the computer that sits in
front of you at work is there are no rules,'' says L. Camille
Hebert, author of ``Employee Privacy Law'' and associate dean of
the Ohio State University College of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Maltby is blunter: ``Employers can do whatever they want. The
only statute that is even remotely applicable is the wiretapping
laws, and that only applies to the spoken word. So your boss might
have some trouble listening to your telephone calls at work, but an
employer can freely read your e-mail, when the same message would
been a violation if it was a telephone conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   And surveillance doesn't stop with e-mail. There are many
computer programs that will monitor which Internet sites are being
visited, and how long an employee stays there.
</P>
<P>
   For example, SurfWatch Software can either block access to sites
or simply monitor what sites are being used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are looking at this type of solution more and more
for three reasons,'' says Theresa Marcroft, director of marketing
for the California company.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is productivity. If I am spending half my day buying books
or planning a vacation, the boss is not getting the productivity he
would like, he would expect, or he is paying for. Second, there is
liability, with huge color monitors that show pictures of nudes,
white supremacists, or antiabortionists. That can create a hostile
workplace environment. And thirdly, companies look at this to
optimize their networks. If rich videos are being downloaded, the
network is not as fast for people trying to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about the worker who comes to work after having been to
the doctor's and been told she has breast cancer? Or the employee
who is coming to grips with being a survivor of incest? In both
cases, it is probable that they would do some research on the
Internet, and just as probable that they would not want anyone _
especially supervisors _ to know about it.
</P>
<P>
   Policies on computer, Internet, and e-mail usage vary widely
from company to company. Some prohibit any personal use, others are
quite liberal. In most cases, the company's written policies
indicate whether employees can be monitored. But the American
Management Association survey found than in about 15 percent of the
cases, employees were not informed that their computer, Internet,
or e-mail use could be monitored.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day and age, I would say that an employee is foolish
or naive who allows information to be stored in his or her computer
that he or she does not want the employer to be aware of,'' says
Craig M. Cornish, a Colorado lawyer and cochairman of the privacy
committee of the American Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that 21.4 percent of companies review stored
computer files of employees, and as with e-mail, more than half of
those reviews were conducted randomly, rather than on preselected
employees.
</P>
<P>
   What an employer finds on one's PC can lead to considerable
public embarrassment. In the case of Thiemann, discovery of the
pornographic images on his Harvard-owned computer resulted in not
only the loss of his deanship, but also great personal and
professional discomfort for the Lutheran minister who is married
and the father of two girls.
</P>
<P>
   His case is unusual for several reasons: his high profile in the
community, his outspokenness on matters of morality, and the fact
that the computer in question was in a Harvard-owned house. Would
Thiemann's punishment have been any less severe if the offending
material were discovered on a bookshelf in his home instead of on
his disk drive?
</P>
<P>
   While not speaking specifically about the case, Thiemann's
lawyer, Charles Ogletree, believes there is a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about a common-sense approach to what a
reasonable expectation of privacy might be, it would be much
different if it was in a library, but common sense and technology
seem to clash. That is not to say the outcome in the present case
is justified or reasonable,'' said Ogletree, a professor at Harvard
Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Another complication in the Thiemann case is that he requested
more disk space for his computer and asked the computer department
to transfer some files to the new disk drive.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Harvard says it did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The factual premise that Dean Thiemann's resignation was the
product of an intrustion on his privacy initiated by university
staff members is incorrect,'' said Harvard spokesman Joseph Wrinn.
``In both policy and practice Harvard is deeply respectful of the
privacy interests of its faculty and staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrinn would not comment further.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the technician performing the work saw
graphic images on the screen when they began working, or if files
were opened, something that would not ordinarily be necessary when
transferring them. If it was the former, that could have raised
harassment issues for the technician or technicians who did the
work. If it was the latter (regardless of one's views of
pornography), it raises the question of whether Thiemann's
expectation of privacy was violated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one thing to say `transfer these files' and quite
another to say `feel free to look at anything I've done for the
last 12 years,' '' says Ohio State's Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the issue, Harvard University's
computer-use policy prohibits obscene material.
</P>
<P>
   While court cases involving employee privacy in cyberspace have
been view and far between, Hebert does not hold out much hope for
relief there.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess,'' she says, ``is the way courts will ultimately go
is they will find employees have relatively little right to privacy
in employer-owned machines.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't look to Washington for relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress is sitting on their hands,'' says Maltby. ``Everyone
agrees that privacy laws are badly outdated and need to be updated,
even the business community agrees with that, but the current
Congress could not be less interested.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you accept the reality that a workplace PC does, in fact,
belong to the employer, it's hard to deny the logic that follows:
If a company owns the machine, it has a right to examine its own
property, including what information is being stored there and what
Web sites are being visited. Still, many employees have a hard time
believing that, day to day, what they do on their PCs is anyone's
business but their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is popular now for an employer to monitor and censor the
content of information that people can put in a computer because of
sexual harassment in the workplace,'' says Cornish. ``It is just a
New York minute from there to say, `We want to censor you with
respect to violent content.' Then, eventually, it becomes
political. It is classic `Big Brother.' ''

MELANOMA: THE DARK SIDE OF THE SUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, Robert Flynn, now 63, tried to talk his seven
brothers into using sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn and his 10 siblings spent much of their childhood
swimming, sunning, and playing on Revere Beach, just outside
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, they didn't listen to Robert. About eight years
ago, his brother Larry, now 60, found out he had melanoma, the most
fatal form of skin cancer. He contacted his other siblings and
found out that Frank, too, got the diagnosis. And Harry. And Gus.
Fortunately, all were caught in time and the brothers have lived to
tell the tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor thought we should have done ourselves a favor and
grown up in Alaska,'' said Robert Flynn, who has fair skin and blue
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn's doctor believes he didn't get the disease because of his
religious use of sunscreen. But 30 years ago, there was less of an
awareness by the general public that there was such a strong
connection between sunlight exposure and melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were young, mother just gave us 11 kids tomato
sandwiches and sent us to the beach. No protection,'' Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all cancers diagnosed in the US this year will be skin
cancer, making it the most common cancer diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of melanoma, the least common but most deadly form
of skin cancer, has doubled among Caucasians in the past 20 years,
probably due to a combination of factors including depletion of the
earth's ozone layer _ which filters out the sun's most damaging
ultraviolet wavelengths _ and greater time spent outdoors on
beaches, golf courses, hiking trails, and the like.
</P>
<P>
   While adults may suit up for the sun with a hat, sunglasses, and
long pants, children and teenagers usually have better things to do
than conjure up ways to avoid the sun.
</P>
<P>
   But studies indicate that intense, early exposure to sunlight
may trigger many cases of skin cancer. Indeed, just a few severe
sunburns during childhood may be all it takes to set the stage for
melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   Although whites get melanoma at far greater rates than blacks,
Asians, and Hispanics _ mainly because their skin has less
protective pigment _ no racial group is immune from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Last month a federal ``cancer report card'' noted that the
number of new cancer cases declined significantly for most cancers
between 1990 and 1996 _ except for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and
melanoma. The incidence of melanoma rose almost three percent a
year during the six-year period.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 44,200 new cases of melanoma are expected to be
diagnosed in the US this year, a six percent increase over last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, melanoma is one of the most preventable _ and if detected
early _ curable of the deadly cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Because about 80 percent of a person's lifetime exposure to the
sun was accumulated before he or she turned 18, it's important to
put sunscreen on young children and drive home the point to
teenagers, said Kenneth Arndt, chief of dermatology at Beth Israel
Deaconess Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Adults who had even one severe sunburn during childhood increase
their risk of developing melanoma by 40 percent, said Margaret
Tucker, chief of the genetic epidemiology branch at the National
Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Peck, director of the Melanoma Center at the Washington
Hospital Center in Washington, D.C., said he had a patient with
melanoma who could only recall one blistering sunburn during her
childhood. It was on the top of her foot, near the toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the exact spot where she got her melanoma,'' said Peck,
who added that he recently diagnosed a 12-, 13-, and 15-year-old
with melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   So it's critical for people to check their skin for
unusual-looking moles or moles that have changed in shape or color
and to get an annual skin check by a primary care doctor or
dermatologist, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   New York dermatologist Dr. Patricia Wexler said that she sees
more cases of melanoma than she did 10 years ago and in
progressively younger patients. In the early 1980s, for example,
most of the melanoma cases she saw were in adults in their 50s to
70s. In the last four years, she has seen patients in their 20s to
40s.
</P>
<P>
   When a new patient comes in to see Wexler about facial wrinkles
or acne, she requires each one to go through a full-body skin
check.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to completely undress, including underwear. Even
though they frequently say `I've had a checkup or I have a doctor,'
'' said Wexler. ``If I take care of their skin, I have to know if
they have any skin cancers. That's the first order of priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Although melanoma is the most feared form of skin cancer, it is
the least common. Basal and squamous cell carcinomas are the most
frequent type _ they account for about 95 percent of all skin
cancers _ and they are easy to remove. Basal cell carcinoma is
rarely fatal, but if the squamous cell type is left untreated, it
can spread and be deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Flynn had two cases of basal-cell carcinoma, which occurs
most frequently on the face, ears, and arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor said that the only reason I got basal instead (of
melanoma) was because I started using sunscreen as soon as it came
out on the market,'' said Flynn, who added that he ``positively
loves the sun'' and still goes to the beach every day.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(SIDEBAR) &QL; 
SKIN CHECKS NOT USUALLY PART OF PHYSICAL &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Gross wished her husband's primary care doctor had been
a little more forceful about having him go to a dermatologist.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1996, the physician noticed a spot on her husband
Louis' left shoulder and simply told him, `you should get it looked
at,' Patricia recalls. Louis never did. Five months later, Patricia
noticed the mole and suggested that her husband see a
dermatologist.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising as it may seem, checking the skin for melanoma is not
a standard part of the routine physical exam, said Dr. Julie R.
Lange, assistant professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins Medical
Institutions. She and her collegues conducted a study, published in
February in the Journal of the American Medical Association, that
indicated that physicians were four times more likely than patients
to detect early melanomas. The melanomas doctors caught were also
substantially thinner than patient-detected tumors, meaning they
were found at an earlier stage.
</P>
<P>
   Lange recommends that everyone take the initative and ask their
primary care physician to look at their skin during regular
physical exams.
</P>
<P>
   However, fair-skinned, blue-eyed people of northern European
ancestry and those who have a lot of freckles and moles are most at
risk for melanoma and should talk to their doctor about whether
it's necessary for them to see a dermatologist for a yearly exam,
doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to keep in mind, however, that anyone, of any
race, can get melanoma, Lange said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't assume just because you are not Caucasian,'' Lange
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reggae musician Bob Marley died of melanoma at age 36.
</P>
<P>
   And those with a family history of melanoma are also at risk,
even if they do not spend a lot of time in the sun; researchers are
not completely sure why this is but they suspect some people have a
genetic predisposition to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Once Larry Flynn found out he had a melanoma tumor, his doctor
asked him to call his 10 siblings. Three brothers have had melanoma
and only one sister has escaped skin cancer so far. Flynn's tumor,
which was a large mole, bigger than a pencil eraser, was removed in
1984 and he has had no recurrences.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn, 60, now makes regular visits to his dermatologist once or
twice a year. He never put a dab of sunscreen on before his wife
discovered the odd-looking mole on his chest. Now he slathers it on
every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even go to the store without something on,'' Flynn
said.

KEEPING THE RAYS AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't all that long ago that ``sunscreen'' was called suntan
lotion. The older lotions offered some protection but not much.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do today's sunscreens contain more effective chemicals
to deflect or absorb the sun's rays, they are available in an array
of products like moisturizers, cosmetics, and baby lotion.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara Gilchrest, chair of the dermatology department at
Boston University School of Medicine, says these products are not
gimmicks _ they really do work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recommend them to all my patients and friends,'' Gilchrest
said.
</P>
<P>
   They can be worn every day, whether or not a person goes out in
the sun.'' she added. ``If you ask people whether they get sun,
many will say no. But everybody probably gets at least a good half
hour, even when they spend most of the time in the office. That
cumulative exposure probably does a lot of damage.''
</P>
<P>
   But are those products enough?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but only if you spend most of your time indoors, Gilchrest
said. For a day of beachcombing, people should use sunscreen, she
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's the fair-skinned office worker who has intense,
intermittent exposure on weekends and travels to sunny beaches for
mid-winter holidays who is most at risk for melanoma, Gilchrest
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why melanomas most commonly appear on skin that's not
ordinarily exposed to the sun, like backs for men and lower legs in
women.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Morley, 35, who spends most of his time in an office,
not only uses sunscreen on a regular basis but takes other
precautions, such as staying out of the sun during peak sunburning
hours mid-day and wearing tightly-woven T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   It all started nearly three months ago when his father had a
melanoma tumor removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got so paranoid. I started looking at every freckle,'' said
Morley, who lives near the water, in Scituate.
</P>
<P>
   But even before then, he knew he couldn't stay in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I would be red or white, '' said Morley, adding, ``I
would rather be white.''
</P>
<P>
   He also is careful about his two children. ``By the time they
are done playing, they are covered with sunscreen and sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sunscreens are labeled as ``sunblocks,'' but the Food and
Drug Administration recently banned the use of the term starting in
2001 because no product blocks 100 percent of ultraviolet rays.
Some tanning occurs even when using high SPF products. Some of the
lotions have been called sunblocks because they include either zinc
oxide or titanium oxide, both of which deflect the sun's rays.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA also called for products to be labeled at a cap of SPF
30 because it is difficult to tell if there is an increased benefit
to the higher SPF products.
</P>
<P>
   Although many lotions are labeled ``broad spectrum,'' meaning
that they screen out UVA and UVB rays, doctors point out that there
is no way to know if this is true because there is no standardized
test for broad-spectrum products.
</P>
<P>
   Zinc and titanium oxide are good at filtering out UVA. Other
UVA-filtering ingredients include oxybenzone and avobenzone, also
known as Parsol 1789.
</P>
<P>
   The first sunscreens used para-amino benzoic acid (PABA), but
the ingredient is no longer used because it was found to be a
possible carcinogen.
</P>
<P>
   However, sunscreen use will never be the sole answer to reducing
the rate of melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they say they use it, did they reapply if that was
needed? Was it on thick enough?'' said Dr. Arthur Sober, associate
chief of dermatology at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, people should try to stay out of the sun; sunscreen
doesn't block all of the sun's ultraviolet rays and people may get
a false sense of security from wearing it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may know that I can't stay outside for 15 minutes without
getting burned. But then I put on sunscreen and I can stay out for
four hours and not feel bad. But over that period, I get more UV
exposure,'' said Sober.
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers claim that their ``sunblock fabrics'' are
equivalent to wearing an SPF 30 sunscreen, but Consumer Reports
found that some regular clothing, like Hanes Beefy-T, are just as
good at screening out UV rays.
</P>
<P>
   And the UV-blocking umbrellas? Probably a marketing gimmick.

WELCOME TO ROYALTY, SOPHIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Do little girls still dream of marrying a prince? Or do
they know better now? In the PD (Post Diana) era, we must be
grateful that there are so few princes in circulation. Who would
wish the princess life on any girl?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, The Sun, a British tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch,
published an 11-year-old photo of Sophie Rhys-Jones's bare breast
with the headline ``Sophie Topless.'' ``Sophie who?,'' you may ask,
because the June 19 royal wedding has failed to excite much
interest here.
</P>
<P>
   Even in England, the union of Prince Edward and the lovely
Sophie hasn't captured the public imagination the way other royal
marriages have. That was true until last week, at least, before the
unveiling of the soon-to-be-royal-by-marriage nipple.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to think that the widespread lack of interest
in their marriage is a legacy of the Diana debacle, that the press
and the public have learned the price celebrities pay for our
relentless curiosity about their private lives. But that doesn't
appear to be the case. We haven't learned a thing.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the problem: Baldish prince, remotely in line to the
throne, weds 35-year-old PR woman. Dullsville. Their union lacks
the glamour of the Charles and Diana wedding, the rumbustiousness
of the Andrew and Fergie nuptials. Until last week, the wedding
threatened to be exactly what the couple wishes, a private affair,
as private as royal affairs get, at least.
</P>
<P>
   But now the world has the bride's bare breast to contemplate,
and suddenly it all seems a little more interesting. A former
co-worker of Sophie's sold the snapshot, the fruit of holiday high
jinks to The Sun for a sum said to be in the neighborhood of
$400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Sophie. Marrying into that family, knowing that inevitably
she'll have to to endure _ variously _ scrutiny, vilification,
adoration, scorn from the media and the public. There is something
about commoners who dare consort with royals that brings out the
savage in some observers, kind of a who-does-she-think-she-is
response.
</P>
<P>
   In the April issue of W, the editors invited various fashion and
beauty luminaries to describe in detail what they would do to
``improve'' Camilla Parker Bowles. ``She needs a total makeover _
she's looking dowdy and frumpy,'' said one fashionista. A plastic
surgeon prescribed ``a complete rejuvenation.'' A designer advised
her to wear black leather by day, red by night. ``She could be a
Scarlet Woman,'' he sniffed. ``After all, she is anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a scurrilous article, and I lapped up every word, even as
I contemplated how awful it must be to have to endure such
uninvited critical attention. We've seen what it did to the
emotionally fragile Diana. But despite her physical resemblance to
the late princess, Sophie appears to be made of stronger stuff.
She's not an emotionally vulnerable, self-obsessed neurotic but a
successful career woman. She's what bridal magazines call a
``mature'' bride, and thus, perhaps, a disappointment to those who
long for another royal virgin sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Given the way it played out, the incident might have been a PR
stunt engineered to make Sophie seem more sympathetic and
appealingly human than she has to date. She is in the business,
after all. But the bride-to-be was reportedly ``distraught'' over
the photo. It must have been difficult for her to find that her
bare breast was winking at the world from the Sun's pages, but
perhaps she should try to put the situation in historical
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the word ``topless,'' applied to royal
marriage, had a more sinister meaning. Off with her top? Better
than off with her head.

THE GIRLS' GUIDE TO HUNTING AND FISHING 
By Melissa Bank. 
Viking. 274 pp. $23.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody wants a kid sister like Jane Rosenal, at least in
theory: She's brainy and mouthy and hilariously funny, and she can
make cracks at the dinner table that will salvage a deadly family
reunion. She's loyal beyond measure, even when her brother, Henry,
is being a jerk, or when no one in the nuclear unit can talk about
her father's impending death. In the larger world, this fidelity
can get her into trouble _ keeping her tied to a lazy, Cruella
DeVil of a boss, say, or holding up the sinking vessel of her
alcoholic lover. But throughout most of the foibles of
young-white-girl Manhattan, Jane tends to rally with a survival
instinct that would make her father proud. If she can't always
navigate the straightest path to a decent job or boyfriend, she at
least possesses enough wry one-liners to get her from one jam to
the next.
</P>
<P>
   As the protagonist of Melissa Bank's debut story collection,
Jane also has a lot riding these days on just how captivating she
turns out to be. Surfing the latest wave of self-induced publishing
frenzy, ``The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing'' is supposed to
be one of America's answers to Bridget Jones, the fictional British
gooflet who won her public's heart by losing her pantyhose and
obsessively measuring the circumference of her thighs. The book
industry on this side of the Atlantic has responded by searching
for every first-time, 30ish single woman writer between here and
Pasadena _ with the hope that a well-timed publishing trend may
constitute a Zeitgeist, or at least a barrelful of profits.
</P>
<P>
   So: Poor Jane, who is now in danger of being overexposed by
publicists and underestimated by disappointed critics. Separate
from all the hype, she actually belongs to the current school of
funny-sad fictional heroines whose narrative lives are accomplished
by laconic prose: Rebecca Stowe's ``Not the End of the World,'' or
Julie Hecht's ``Do the Windows Open?'' Bank's strength is dialogue,
and the consequent emergence of Jane as an authentic character is
largely handled with streamlined grace. After only two of the seven
linked stories (which follow Jane from age 14 to her mid-30s), you
realize she's taken on depth and color: You know who this
girl-woman is, or will become, solely through her inimitable voice.
</P>
<P>
   That's harder than it looks, since it's a matter of delivering
essence instead of window dressing. But this kind of fictional
structure also raises the bar on Jane's life: Because her story is
delivered mostly in the first person, we have no wider view of the
world or even much alternate opinion about Jane herself. What we're
offered instead is the obviously limited internal scaffolding of a
young, coming-of-age bio _ a girl nurtured in the sheltering
suburbs of Philadelphia, fed and watered annually on the Jersey
shore, then thrust into the lion's den of midtown Manhattan, where
murderers and mean boyfriends and bad temp jobs await.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these stories were published individually in
periodicals, and their cumulative effect is that of a photo collage
of Jane at different life stages: Poised at adolescence, looking to
Henry for the instruction book on how to live; struggling through
her mid-20s by leaning on an older man; facing the shifting sands
of loneliness and illness without the physician father who so loved
her. These moments are all captured with comic understatement,
self-pity and self-importance being traits Jane wouldn't recognize
if they mugged her. But it soon becomes clear that the experiences
of ``a blurry young woman,'' as her older lover calls her, stripped
of any overarching metaphor, are simply poignant, amusing, and
ordinary. They're not so much cliches as they are universally
predictable: Oh, there's the mentor father-figure, you think;
wonder how long before she outgrows the relationship and dumps him?
Oh look, there's Mr. Right! Hope she doesn't blow it!
</P>
<P>
   Though much of Jane's resonance as a character unfolds through
her comic reflection, Bank is clever to a fault: The over-the-top
one-liners, and there are more than a few, stick out like drugstore
jewelry on a little girl. But the real danger of this kind of
armor-humor is that, once it stops, the serious prose underneath
begs to be covered back up. Take the breakup with Archie, Jane's
elder by 28 years, who's drinking himself to death and, even stone
sober, wouldn't be right for her:
</P>
<P>
   ``As gently as I could, I told him what I'd figured out about
us. He nodded, and I went on, saying what I thought was wrong and
why. When I told him that we couldn't talk openly to each other, I
realized that I was now. It made me wonder if we really did have to
break up.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps unfairly, I have quoted what may be the worst passage in
the book. But the crimes committed in this sequence of emotion _
youthful sentimentality, delusion posing as insight _ are
indicative of the greater problem with ``The Girls' Guide to
Hunting and Fishing,'' one fairly common to first works of fiction.
The book feels autobiographical, which is to say that it suffers
from the limitations of a writer's insular emotional experience.
Whether these subplots actually mirror Bank's life is beside the
point; real life almost always prowls inside of fiction, but it
can't breathe without some kind of technical and aesthetic
transformation. Otherwise, what you have is memoir with the names
changed, and you can feel it in a dozen different ways. The story
is funny, but the wisdom is over-the-counter, and there's not
enough air in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Bank is a talented writer whose gifts promise wider
territory ahead; she has probably learned a great deal from the
writing of these stories. The title story, the last in the
collection, is a delightful sendup of the troglodyte prom-queen
dating guide ``The Rules,'' and it's charming enough to make you
forget all her creator's missteps in order to wish Jane well. By
now _ having endured the cruelties of youth in the cruelest of
cities _ she has a standard poodle named Jezebel and a cartoonist
boyfriend, and her favorite novel is ``Anna Karenina.'' Maybe her
days of bad choices are over.

TRUFFAUT 
A Biography 
By Antoine de Baecque and Serge Toubiana. Translated, from the
French, by Catherine Temerson. Knopf. 462 pp. Illustrated. $30. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This solid chapter-and-verse study of Francois Truffaut gives a
sense not only of completeness but also of closure. Antoine de
Baecque and Serge Toubiana are the editors of Cahiers du Cinema,
the periodical Truffaut used as a professional launching pad
between 1953 and 1958, when the preferred delivery system for film
comment was impassioned polemics rather than soundbites, or thumbs.
Truffaut _ bright, nervous, intense, and shrewdly opportunistic _
came sizzling into the limelight with a broadside against French
blue-chip films and an enthusiasm for American genre movies.
</P>
<P>
   He began writing screenplays almost as soon as he began writing
criticism. His days and nights as a critic ended in 1958, when he
got his father-in-law, film distributor Ignace Morgenstern, to back
his first film, ``The 400 Blows.'' It became a landmark that
launched not only Truffaut, but also his young contemporaries known
as the New Wave. Drawn from a troubled childhood shared with a pal,
Robert Lachenay, it also established Truffaut as among the most
personal of filmmakers. Like his idol, Jean Renoir, Truffaut kept
his films intimate and domestic in scale, lyrical and modest in
gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Truffaut even named his film company Les Films du Carosse, for
Renoir's ``The Golden Coach.'' The open-ended closing shot of ``The
400 Blows,'' with its freeze-frame of a delinquent boy staring
blankly at the ocean, caught the Zeitgeist of the culture of
alienated youth to come in the '60s and '70s. Many of Truffaut's
films were chapters in an ongoing psychic autobiography. With ``The
400 Blows,'' Truffaut created a cinematic alter ego, Antoine
Doinel, played by Jean-Pierre Leaud. In four subsequent films _
``Antoine and Colette,'' ``Stolen Kisses,'' ``Bed and Board,'' and
``Love on the Run'' _ Truffaut took Doinel from juvenile
delinquency to a career as a minor author, repeatedly snatching him
from the jaws of bourgeois respectability by endowing him with
unreliability. (Just as Truffaut was taken under the wing of critic
Andre Bazin, so he and his wife took in Leaud to live with them.)
</P>
<P>
   Truffaut documented his own life with a meticulousness that
verged on obsession, and the authors had access to his letters,
diaries, journals, papers, and notes for the autobiography he never
lived to write. They reinforce the image from ``The 400 Blows'' of
Truffaut as an unwanted (and out-of-wedlock) child who spent a
lifetime in a state of anxiety over his ability to attract and keep
the love of a woman. The message he got from his own mother was
that she'd just as soon not have him around. He had a number of
intimate women friends, but was close to few men. Predictably,
there was much sexual infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   The book makes a good case for the view that Truffaut's most
inconsequential film, ``The Man Who Loved Women,'' might have come
closest to the truth about him. About that skirt-chaser, Truffaut
himself wrote, ``It seems that Joey never got through to his
mother.'' Its lothario was anything but the cocky figure played by
Burt Reynolds in the disastrous Hollywood remake. Rather, he was
always in a sweat about women, desperate and nervous. Another
Truffaut flop, ``The Green Room,'' about a man fixated on the dead
in his life, was something Truffaut envisioned for years. But it
didn't actually happen, the authors point out, until Truffaut
himself went into mourning for the death of his relationship with
Catherine Deneuve, who dumped him when she learned he had been
unfaithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truffaut: A Biography'' doesn't so much unearth new aspects of
Truffaut's life as corroborate with a satisfying fullness of detail
what we knew. It quotes New Wave colleague Claude Chabrol as saying
unhesitatingly that Truffaut's great theme in his love and work was
the search for harmonious relationships. Certainly Truffaut's films
about actors _ ``Day for Night'' and ``The Last Metro'' _ represent
idyllic re-creations of the extended communal families the lonely
adolescent found first in the cine-clubs of postwar Paris, then,
once admitted to it, in the world of film itself.
</P>
<P>
   In a culturally divisive era, he was one of the few who bridged
French and American styles and concerns. A certain elan is common
to both cultures _ and to most of Truffaut's films. The gentleness
and affection that permeate so many of them inspired a
quintessential piece of casting by Steven Spielberg. When Spielberg
made ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' a statement of
trusting, childlike belief in a benevolent higher intelligence, he
cast Truffaut as the wonder-struck scientist who embodied its
message. Long after his New Wave colleagues went off in their
different directions, Truffaut retained his ability to convey
sophisticated, subtle emotional worlds with childlike enthusiasm
and freshness of vision.
</P>
<P>
   But he also retained enough critical, and self-critical,
intelligence to realize the trap that mindset could be. What was
charming at 30 was less so at 40. Truffaut, who died at 52 of a
brain tumor, said he began feeling old in his 40s. His later films
seemed to reflect a decline in vitality and spontaneity. He never
got the chance to show us _ and himself _ whether youthful
impetuousity would be replaced by mature reflectiveness and
expansiveness. Whether, in short, he'd have become his own Renoir.
It's impossible to watch Truffaut play the scientist who tames the
primitive boy in his own film ``The Wild Child,'' and not wonder if
he wasn't fashioning an allegory of his own self-taming. He never
lived to grapple fully with the problem of making the transition
from youth to age. But his films, at their best, don't have to.
This bountiful portrait of them, and the man they sprung from, will
help keep both alive.

IS LIQUID NITROGEN GOOD FOR THE LAWN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The groundskeeper (for the Red Sox spring training camp) in
Fort Myers said one reason the grass looks so good is that he
regularly fertilized it with liquid nitrogen. Would this do
anything more than freeze the grass?
</P>
<P>
   M.S. MIT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This might be a good time for you to get out of the lab and
into the garden.
</P>
<P>
   The liquid nitrogen used for scientific, medical, and industrial
purposes to deep freeze things very quickly, is indeed cold enough
to freeze grass _ 320 degrees below zero, Fahrenheit!
</P>
<P>
   That's the stuff (nitrogen gas under pressure) with the mist on
top in that beaker at the science fair that you dip a rubber ball
in for a few seconds, take it out, drop it and watch it shatter
like a lightbulb.
</P>
<P>
   The groundskeeper was probably just using nitrogen fertilizer
mixed with water.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How does fertilizer effect the environment?
</P>
<P>
   J.B., Fitchburg, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. By definition, fertilizer helps plants grow and function
efficiently. But too much of a good thing can be a bad thing. Too
much fertilizer, and too much growth, can mean environmental
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   You may have seen the N-P-K formula on fertilizers. The N is for
nitrogen, which promotes growth by helping cells grow longer. The P
is for phosphorous, an important part of the process by which all
living things convert nutrients into usable energy. The K in the
fertilizer formula is for potassium (K stands for Kalium,
potassium's German name).
</P>
<P>
   Potassium balances the electrolytes in tissue so the right
amount of water stays in the plants cells. Think of each plant cell
like a water balloon. Too much water and it can burst. Too little
and it shrivels up. (Think of a wilting flower that hasn't been
watered.)
</P>
<P>
   The right amount of water in each cell helps it function
efficiently and maintain the right shape and strength to support
the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the environmental problem with N. If we use too much, the
plants can't absorb it all. When the extra nitrogen (from
fertilizer on our lawns or gardens, or from leaking septic systems)
washes into surface aquatic ecosystems, it fertilizes the plants
living there.
</P>
<P>
   That's called eutrophication, the process of enriching the
aquatic ecosystem more than it's used to. Plant growth increases.
Ever see a little pond choked with algae and plants so thick you
can't even swim in the water? That's eutrophication.
</P>
<P>
   But that's more than just bad news to swimmers or boaters, or
wildlife like birds or aquatic mammals. When those plants die,
microbes digest their tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Microbes need oxygen to help them break down their food just
like we do. They get their oxygen from the water.
</P>
<P>
   Too many dying plants feeding too many microbes using up too
much oxygen in the water, means too little oxygen left for the fish
and other organisms that need oxygen for their processes.
Eutrophication can cause massive fish kills.
</P>
<P>
   Fertilizer can have a more direct environmental effect.
Chemically, the N and the P and the K are almost always salts,
which means a positively-charged cation and a negatively charged
anion bonded together.
</P>
<P>
   Salt molecules pull water out of cells like a magnet. Too much
fertilizer on a plant that isn't well-watered causes that burning
you hear about. It's plant cells dying because the fertilizer salts
are pulling out their water.
</P>
<P>
   Organic fertilizers, like manure and compost, have less of an
environmental impact. They'll still burn plants, but the nitrogen
in them occurs in a form that plants can't use until microbes
convert it to a different form.
</P>
<P>
   That takes time. Excess nitrogen from organic fertilizers that
washes into aquatic ecosystems doesn't cause eutrophication as
quickly or dramatically as manufactured fertilizers that provide
nitrogen in forms that plants can use right away.
</P>

   AIR APPARENT &QC; 
How Meteorologists Learned to Map, Predict, and Dramatize Weather &QL; 
By Mark Monmonier &QL; 
University of Chicago Press, 309 pp., illustrated, $27.50 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the threatening day of Jan. 2, something like a million
households were tuned in to the Weather Channel as a major
snowstorm was blanketing the Midwest and _ as virtually all storm
systems do _ heading east.
</P>
<P>
   Radar images looped across the cable channel's weather maps,
snowfall amounts were tracked and predicted, and controlling high-
and low-pressure cells were charted. On a stay-indoors Saturday, it
was endlessly fascinating as well as instructive.
</P>
<P>
   What those Weather Channel viewers receive, writes cartographer
Mark Monmonier, is ``graphic confirmation'' of the ``scientific
sophistication'' that goes into the making of a daily weather
forecast. He could just as easily say that they _ along with those
newspaper readers who turn first to the day's weather map _ are
getting scientific confirmation of the instinct to look out the
window at the state of nature.
</P>
<P>
   In previous books, Monmonier, a professor of geography at
Syracuse University, has explored such matters as the way maps are
used to track environmental dangers and how they can be used (and
very often misused) to influence political decisions about
environmental issues. Now, in ``Air Apparent,'' he turns his
attention to maps that can track the present and future immediate
environment, not to mention let us know whether to bring along an
umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   Monmonier is solid enough in his discussion of geographic and
meteorological information to satisfy the experienced weather
watcher. But even if this information were not presented in such a
lively and engaging manner, it would still hook any reader who
checks the weather map every morning or who sits happily entranced
through a full cycle of forecasts on the Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   In tracing the development of weather mapping, Monmonier turns
the controversy on the impact of weather fronts _ which, along with
symbols for cloud cover and precipitation, are the most prominent
features of today's newspaper weather maps _ into a fascinating bit
of scientific history.
</P>
<P>
   Well into the 1930s, Monmonier writes, US Weather Bureau
officials were ``smugly confident their successful forecasts were
not likely to get much better'' and ``stubbornly resisted the
promising theoretical and practical advances of a small group of
Norwegian meteorologists.''
</P>
<P>
   These scientists' research confirmed the importance of warm and
cold fronts as predictors of approaching changes in the weather. Of
course, ``people could feel their passage'' long before that
research was done. But ``meteorologists gave little thought to
mapping their locations.'' It took pressure from US airline
companies and the military, plus a research project at MIT (headed
by a student of the Norwegians), to get the Weather Bureau to
include fronts as standard features on its maps.
</P>
<P>
   Weather-map addicts will be interested in Monmonier's discussion
of the strengths and weaknesses of today's bright graphics and
innovative presentations. He credits USA Today's ``revolutionary
full-color weather package,'' dominated by a ``large, visually
distinctive map,'' for prompting many newspapers to ``buy color
presses and overhaul their weather packages,'' and impelling the
Associated Press to provide regional weather maps to its
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air Apparent'' is lavishly illustrated. The historical maps
have been redrawn by Monmonier, and in the case of the Portland
storm he aims to recapture ``the map's frantic clutter'' while
focusing on its ``most frightening feature: the huge area of low
pressure centered on southeastern Michigan.'' A 16-page section of
color plates traces the development of weather mapping from the
early 19th century to the present _ including a photograph of his
favorite local Syracuse television weathercaster interpreting a
futuristic ``3-D SkyTrack'' animation.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the threat of a blizzard or a hurricane, most of us
will be checking a weather map at some point today. And now there
is ``Air Apparent'' to explain how it got the way it is _ and what
it all means.

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
 
!!! ``Notting Hill'' Think of this satisfying romantic comedy as a
Hollywoodization of ``Four Weddings and a Funeral.'' It's served up
by that film's producer, writer, and star, Hugh Grant, who
resuscitates his career by playing yet another struggling Brit who
falls for an American. What lifts it all into orbit is Julia
Roberts, drawing on her own experience to play an American screen
goddess with an irresistible mix of poise and vulnerability.
(PG-13) 
 
!! 1/2 ``Southie'' Nobody's going to accuse this home-grown Boston
gangster movie of being slick or formula-free. What keeps it
watchable is the urgency imparted by a totally committed cast
headed by Donnie Wahlberg, James Cummings, and John Shea, playing
characters who can't separate the supportive love from the
pervasive danger on their home turf, delivered with a gritty
realism that's a big help. (R) 
 
! 1/2 ``The Thirteenth Floor'' Snazzy visuals, but little else in
this alternative-worlds sci-fi murder mystery. The best thing in it
is a slightly sepia-toned simulated Los Angeles, circa 1937. Armin
Mueller-Stahl and Vincent D'Onofrio have their moments. Craig
Bierko and Gretchen Mol don't. (R)
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! 1/2 ``Xiu Xiu: The Sent-Down Girl'' Chinese-born actress Joan
Chen makes an impressive directorial debut with this film about a
teenage girl betrayed by China's Cultural Revolution. Sent into
virtual exile in a remote grassland, she scarcely notices the
Tibetan herdsman who loves her. This understated but devastating
story is a deeply felt piece of guerrilla filmmaking, shot without
permission by Chen, whose crew worked the border between China and
Tibet and sent the film back for processing to San Francisco. (R)

THE COMEBACK WORD'S WILD RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 6)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The word  &UR; adventurer &LR;  has been through a half-millennium of
exciting times.
</P>
<P>
   Disrepute was its cradle. The Latin  &UR; advenir &LR;  meant ``come to,''
as in ``come to pass; arrive, happen,'' and a vestige lingers in
gambling lingo as ``betting on the come'' in the hope that what
will come next will enable the gambling  &UR; adventurer &LR;  to win.
 &UR; Adventure &LR;  meant ``coming by chance; the luck of the draw.''
</P>
<P>
   Applied to a person,  &UR; adventurer &LR;  meant ``gamester,'' what we
would now call ``gambler.'' Accordingly, an English ordinance in
1474 decreed that the royal household would bar the ``swearer,
brawler, backbyter'' and `` &UR; adventorer &LR; .'' Five centuries ago the
 &UR; adventorer &LR;  was a fit companion for the secretive  &UR; backbyter &LR; , the
calumniator who whispered his slanders, stabbing reputations in the
back.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling and war combined, as soldiers of fortune bet their
lives on their livelihood; a 1555 usage derided ``our
 &UR; adventurers &LR; , that serue withoute wages,'' supported only by their
plunder. Just seven years before that, Edward Hall in his Chronicle
provided the etymology: ``He gave them a Pennon of St. George and
bade them,  &UR; Adventure &LR;  (of whiche they were called
 &UR; Adventurers &LR; ).''
</P>
<P>
   Most soldiers of fortune were self-glorified brigands; to be
called an  &UR; adventurer &LR;  was to be insulted.
</P>
<P>
   Then the pejorative word had a run of good luck. John Milton, in
his 1667 ``Paradise Lost,'' wrote of ``the Heav'n-banished host''
of fallen angels awaiting the return of their satanic leader ``now
expecting/ Each hour their great  &UR; adventurer &LR;  from the search/ Of
foreign worlds.'' (Though devilish, Lucifer was ``great.'')
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a commercial company was founded in Antwerp and
chartered in England called the Merchant  &UR; Adventurers &LR; , in the
sense of ``enterprise,'' and led in the exploration and
colonization of North America. The hazard to be undertaken was no
longer a time-wasting game, but a dangerous journey, an exploration
for riches or a moral crusade. Jonathan Swift wrote in his ``Tale
of a Tub'' (1704) ``to encourage all aspiring  &UR; adventurers &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   But then it was applied to Prince Charles Edward Stuart in the
pretender's desperate insurrection of 1745; his sobriquet was ``the
Young  &UR; Adventurer &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Then  &UR; adventuring &LR;  became an -ism and lost even more respect. An
English review in 1843 lumped together ``Concubinage, Socialism and
 &UR; Adventurism &LR; ,'' scorning all three as evidence of social decline.
The OED defined it as ``the principles and practice of an
 &UR; adventurer &LR;  or  &UR; adventuress &LR; ; defiance of the ordinary canons of
social decorum.'' An  &UR; adventuress &LR; , especially, was not just a
pinko kept woman but was stigmatized as ``loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse,  &UR; adventurism &LR;  was taken up by politics to define the most
dangerous form of policy. Russian communists in the 1920s called it
 &UR; avantyruizm &LR;  and Lenin considered it so deviationist as to border
on revisionism.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Harold Nicolson, in his 1932 ``Public Faces,''
deplored the way the public ``had ousted the Churchill government
on a charge of  &UR; adventurism &LR; .'' In 1957, The Observer wrote, ``Of
the three official accusations against Marshal Zhukov, that of
` &UR; adventurism &LR; ' appears to be based on no evidence whatsoever.''
Under the communists, it was not merely the practice of a rash,
reckless, precipitate or impetuous policy; it was a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Today, an  &UR; adventurer &LR;  is no longer a person to be feared. The
word has reasserted the romantic, courageous quality that the poet
Keats, in ``Endymion,'' gave it: `` &UR; Adventuresome &LR; ,/ I send My
herald thought into a wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, to be  &UR; adventuresome &LR;  is to be ``bold, daring,'' taking
risks without a connotation of impetuosity or imprudence. Foolhardy
_ having the hardiness of a fool _ is no longer automatically
attached to today's  &UR; adventurers &LR; . The battered old word that
gambled on the come to make its comeback has at last arrived.
</P>
<P>
   HELLMOUTH
</P>
<P>
   ``New York, which gave us a generation of female political
superstars,'' wrote Gail Collins in The New York Times Magazine,
``has turned into the  &UR; hellmouth &LR;  of women in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   What's a  &UR; hellmouth &LR; ? In the back of my head was Tennyson's
``Charge of the Light Brigade'': ``Into the jaws of death,/ Into
the mouth of hell/ Rode the six hundred.'' The image of the
entrance to hell as the mouth of a horrifying sea monster is
familiar to infernologists; the Book of Job's crocodilelike
Leviathan has lips ``ringed round with fearsome fangs'' and ``from
his mouth flames leap like sparks of fire escaping.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudyard Kipling, in his 1891 ``Tomlinson,'' had the Devil taunt
his hero, ``Now ye wait at  &UR; Hell-Mouth &LR;  Gate,'' taking the word
Spenser used three centuries earlier in his ``Faerie Queene.'' On
the medieval stage in Metz, France, the mystery play employed
special effects of a mechanical monster with what was called its
 &UR; hellmouth &LR;  agape, sparks shooting out. Was this the derivation of
my colleague's unfamiliar usage?
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; Hellmouth &LR; , right now, comes most directly from `Buffy the
Vampire Slayer,''' Ms. Collins said, referring to the series
telecast Tuesday nights on the WB (Warner Bros.) network. ``It's
the place where all things evil sort of arrive on the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a bit of an etymological letdown, but it's good to see
writers for today's TV series drawing on medieval theatrical
traditions. In the community of Sunnydale, the fictional
``watcher'' of Buffy _ a high school student with a knack for
slaying the evil beings lurking at the local  &UR; hellmouth &LR;  _
explains, ``The Spanish who first settled the area called it Boca
Del Infierno _ roughly translated, ` &UR; Hellmouth &LR; ' _ a sort of portal
from this reality to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to its rebirth in the series, the archaic word (it had
all but abandoned hope) has returned to vogue in related contexts
of horror. In the Kokomo, Ind., Tribune, Todd Burlage warned:
``They appear as  &UR; hell mouths &LR;  in the road and can sneak up on a
driver about as subtly as a hurricane. They are potholes.''

THE THING ABOUT `BOSTON MARRIAGE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The American Repertory Theatre is billing the new
David Mamet play, ``Boston Marriage,'' as a groundbreaking work for
the playwright because it is ``set at the turn of the century'' and
``features an all-female cast.'' But Mamet himself isn't talking.
And he doesn't want anyone to read the script before the play opens
at ART on Friday because it's changing daily during rehearsals. So
precisely what territory is being conquered here? What ground is
beingbroken? What is the thing about the thing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of Oscar Wilde and Samuel Beckett and mush them
together,'' Rebecca Pidgeon says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And throw in a little, a little, a little, a little what?''
adds Felicity Huffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well . . . a little Mamet,'' is the reply.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, that explains it.
</P>
<P>
   Wilde. Beckett. Mamet. The master of Victorian manners, the
granddaddy of postwar absurdity, and the maestro of contemporary
machismo. Those are three writers you'd never expect to inhabit the
same paragraph, much less the same room or the same stage. But as
Pidgeon and Huffman, joined by colleague Mary McCann, discuss the
play in an ART rehearsal studio, the sensibilities of all three
writers seem to influence the conversation _ that is to say, the
dialogue is polished and polite, with a hint of futility and a bit
of an edge.
</P>
<P>
   You see, the performers don't want to reveal too much about the
plot, which they say is full of Mamet's signature twists and turns.
``Oh, it gets very complicated, and we don't want to get into
actual plot details, do we?'' says Pidgeon. All three women are
longtime collaborators of the playwright (Pidgeon is his wife), and
they say they've never seen him _ or anyone else, for that matter _
write anything quite like this.
</P>
<P>
   This much we do know: Popularized by Henry James's 1886 novel,
``The Bostonians,'' the term ``Boston marriage'' is an antiquated
euphemism for two women sharing their lives in relationships that
were passionate and romantic, yet sexually ambivalent, at least to
the outside world. In Mamet's play, the partners (played by Pidgeon
and Huffman) are women of a certain class who live on the fringes
of genteel society; they don't have the income to keep crumpets on
the table and a roof over the parlor, so one of them finds a man
with an endowment who will become their ``protector.'' Meanwhile,
the other has fallen in love with someone else, raising questions
about the meaning of marriage and the sanctity of bonds.
</P>
<P>
   These women are forever dropping obscure literary and scientific
facts, but they're really quite ``clueless'' about the dirty,
down-to-earth details of life. The maid, played by McCann, serves
as a sort of Greek chorus, interrupting the high-minded chatter
with simple yet profound truths. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mamet's women &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so educated, but in a way, they're so vacant,'' says
Pidgeon. ``Dave said to me on the way home from work the other day,
`God, these women are just so dumb, aren't they?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some would argue that the women in Mamet's other plays aren't
exactly brain-surgeon material, either _ if they appear at all. In
the theater, Mamet is best known for creating a testosterone-pumped
world where bruisers and losers compete viciously in man-eat-man
battles, whether they be the two-bit thugs of ``American Buffalo,''
the oily salesmen of ``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' or the smarmy
Hollywood types of ``Speed-the-Plow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People have had strong'' _ a pause _ ``and diverse reactions
to the females of his other plays,'' says McCann. The character of
Carol in ``Oleanna'' received the strongest reaction of all; in the
play, a college student destroys a professor's career by charging
him with harassment, among other things. That play divided
audiences, mostly (but not exclusively) along gender lines. Anyone
predisposed to object to so-called ``political correctness'' saw
the student as a manipulative witch; others saw Mamet as the
manipulator, stacking the deck to make the woman seem like a
witless pawn in a grand scheme to emasculate the powers that be.
</P>
<P>
   Pidgeon played the role at ART and on Broadway; McCann replaced
her in the New York production. Often, audience members interrupted
the performance, yelling things like ``Kill her'' and ``Bitch.''
``It was like a Rorschach test,'' says McCann. ``Everyone's
reaction was very much from their own experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The women in ``Boston Marriage,'' of course, are wildly
different from the character in ``Oleanna.'' They're from a
different time, a different social class, different backgrounds and
education _ and, McCann says, ``they get to wear better clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   And speak a different language. The play is a drawing room
comedy in the style of Wilde; while Mamet is known for capturing
the precise rhythms of contemporary speech _ the fractured syntax,
the unfinished thoughts, the evasions and the profanity _ there's
none of that in ``Boston Marriage.'' ``The dialogue is very
Victorian/Edwardian,'' Pidgeon says. ``There is much more _ what's
the word? _ oh, oh, sort of floral. And it's a very feminine
piece.''
</P>
<P>
   There is only ``a wee bit of profanity'' in the piece, Huffman
says, noting that you can't enter a drawing room comedy spewing a
particular verb about a woman named Ruthie the way one character
did in ``American Buffalo.'' ``There are words that are
anachronistic for the time period,'' Huffman adds. ``It's nice
because it keeps shocking you, waking you up and making you look at
the play anew. Who is that guy who keeps shocking you out of it?
You won't believe I forgot his name. That guy who wrote political
plays?''
</P>
<P>
   Brecht?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Brecht. It's not like Brecht; it's not political. But
the effect is the same,'' she says. ``Just when you're lulled into
thinking, `Oh, what nice drawing room ladies,' he'll throw in a
word that you heard Thursday on the street. Not profanity, but
something jarring.''
</P>
<P>
   These drawing room ladies are waiting around for something big
to happen, like Beckett's tramps taking tea in the parlor.
``They're like Gwendolyn and Cecily in a Beckett play,'' says
Pidgeon, referring to Oscar Wilde's ``The Importance of Being
Earnest.'' ``There are elements of absurdity in it. They think
they're in such control, and that they're going to change their
lives, but no. They're out of their element. And then in walks the
maid who blurts out some profound truth and then off she toddles.
We tell her repeatedly to go away, to go away, to go away, but she
never goes away. She's always there to carry some message from the
gods, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Floral language, messages from the gods. ``American Buffalo''
it's not. But, as they say, things change. Mamet is defying his own
stereotypical image as a man's man these days. His latest screen
outing, an adaptation of Terence Rattigan's ``The Winslow Boy,'' is
a gentle exploration of an Edwardian family that risks everything
to clear the name of a teen-age boy accused of a minor crime. A
young suffragette, played by Pidgeon, is the quiet center of the
film, a serene soul with both a genteel demeanor and a steely
dedication to justice.
</P>
<P>
   While Mamet's stage plays have often seemed to be painted in
bold strokes of black and white, ``Winslow Boy'' is sensuously
muted in a soft wash of pastels. Granted, Mamet simply adapted the
play, but he directed the film with a sort of studied reverence for
such values as loyalty and propriety.
</P>
<P>
   Are ``Winslow Boy'' and ``Boston Marriage'' signs of an artistic
shift? Perhaps. It's certainly different: Mamet meets Beckett meets
Wilde. We haven't seen that one before. As for the ``all-female
cast,'' Pidgeon downplays the idea that one ought to call that a
groundbreaking change. ``I don't see it as soft or feminine,'' she
says. ``I see a real play about marriage that is profound and
poignant and beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a love story,'' adds Huffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not soft because of all the stuff they go through to
get to the other side,'' says McCann.
</P>
<P>
   And what is the thing about the marriage thing? What does it say
about marriage _ the Boston kind or the institutional kind? ``I
don't know, to tell you the truth'' says Huffman. ``I'm not trying
to be cagey . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Pidgeon finishes the thought. ``I do, but that would be giving
it away, wouldn't it?'' No surprise there.

 NAGOYA, Japan: ... are unlimited.)  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neither the first batch of MFA shows nor the Nagoya museum's
architecture is worth much of a detour. MFA officials are quick to
insist that Nagoya is a museum about collections, not about a
building. Rather than signing on a Gehry, a Meier, or an I. M. Pei,
Nagoya looked to a big Japanese firm, Nikken Sekkei Ltd., with
Yoshinobu Sato the lead architect on the project. There's been
hairsplitting about whether the museum is part of the hotel complex
or adjacent to it, as if being part of it is somehow less
dignified, even though Japan has a tradition of credible museums in
department stores and corporate headquarters. The Nagoya building
is, in fact, seamless; the museum lobby is a continuation of the
hotel's. Before the recession, there was talk that the hotel would
be developed by Ritz-Carlton. Instead, the Grand Court Nagoya fell
to ANA, a Japanese-based worldwide chain, not exactly in the Ritz
league. (The headboards in the bedrooms are vinyl.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Decent but not dazzling &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The museum lobby feels corporate and chilly. There's no art in
the vast space; there are lots of zigzagging escalators and a glass
elevator that rises between two Ionic columns that replicate those
on the MFA's facade. The exterior of the 31-story skyscraper, the
city's third-tallest structure, is a severe grid of granite, glass,
and metal, the top floors in accordion angles, folded like a
Japanese screen. A resolutely stark contrast to the gaudy chaos of
the rest of downtown Nagoya, the complex is a decent if not a
dazzling building. It boasts something the MFA doesn't have, at
least not yet: underground parking.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the Nagoya museum's three floors is entirely
devoted to the ticket booth and gift shop, the latter a
disappointment. Why the Italian pottery? Why are virtually all the
books about French painting, with nary a one related to the ancient
art exhibition? Why not represent Boston by having work by living
Boston artists, including some from the MFA's affiliate school, for
sale? The shop, operated by Meitetsu Department Stores, is
disappointingly generic _ and in a country that has raised the
department store to a high art. (Japan's finest emporia easily
outclass Harrods or Neiman Marcus.)
</P>
<P>
   As for the inaugural exhibitions, Nagoya got a drab version of
what it asked for and an excellent version of what it didn't.
``Monet, Renoir, and the Impressionist Landscape'' is a lineup of
62 paintings that don't resonate together. They're a hodgepodge,
with some fine works and some duds, big names mixed with
nonentities, and what is possibly the worst Renoir ever, the vapid
_ even by Renoir standards _ ``Children on the Seashore, Guernsey''
(from circa 1883). Given the Japanese public's familiarity with
Impressionist painting, a focused show might have been more
effective than this one-of-everything approach, which, adding
insult to injury, came with wall texts geared toward kindergarten
level.
</P>
<P>
   The Impressionist show is up for five months. ``Art of the
Ancient Mediterranean World'' is up for five years, and its
installation is far more elaborate and inventive. The Japanese
design team is the star here, along with the objects themselves.
The show opens with a stunner _ a glorious gilded mummy mask in
splendid isolation, set against deep turquoise walls. Doorjambs
from the Egyptian tomb of Mehu are set into a doorway, to suggest
their original site. A colossal head of Ramses perches on a tall
pedestal, to give a sense of its height back when it still had a
body. Doll-size models of a brewery and a boat are charming. Dim
lighting makes the mummy coffins extra magical. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Greek enlightenment &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lights go up as you enter the Greek galleries: It's
enlightenment literal and figurative, the installation opening with
an elegant abstraction of a columned portico with a tiny, riveting
Cycladic female figurine hovering in the center. In a farther room
is a series of pedestals, each topped with a Greek marble figure
fragment. Your relationship with these sculptures is all the more
intimate because they're not under glass bonnets. Instead, the
architectonic sprawl of a series of ground-level platforms prevents
your getting too close. Still farther on is a circular,
pantheon-like room whose niches are filled with Roman statuary; in
its center is the marble figure of a woman clad in gloriously
liquid drapery that ripples down on the diagonal.
</P>
<P>
   The MFA's classical collections, long overdue for new galleries
back home, have never looked better than they do now in Japan.
Nagoya also sets a standard for its parent in a spiffy resource
room, a handsome, glass-walled space with Italian chairs and a
serpentine table full of computers where you can consult both
museums' Web sites. The current selection of books for browsing are
all on Boston. Alas, for the most part they're basic tourist
guides, a chamber of commerce selection.
</P>
<P>
   As for future shows bound for Nagoya, the bright spot is an
exhibition on Okakura Kakuzo, the influential Japanese-born curator
of Boston's Department of Chinese and Japanese Art early in this
century. Along with masterpieces Okakura acquired for the MFA,
there will be photographs and archival material about him. It is,
in other words, a show that will require curatorial skills.
``Karsh,'' another show on Nagoya's calendar, is less promising.
The 1996 MFA exhibition of Yousuf Karsh's stilted celebrity
portraits was a low point in the museum's recent programming. The
Nagoya show sounds like a replay. Between Okakura and Karsh comes
``Voice of Mother Earth,'' a selection of Native American art
focusing on Pueblo pottery. Japanese ceramics are, of course,
celebrated worldwide: Japanese reaction to another pottery
tradition will be interesting to track.
</P>
<P>
   Nagoya programming beyond next year hasn't been announced. Let's
hope, though, that the MFA administration encourages its curators
to use their imaginations, to come up with shows that duplicate
neither content nor context. In Japanese museums, artworks are
usually strictly divided according to medium and period, like
paired with like. Shows like the MFA's late, lamented
``Connections'' series, which paired contemporary and historic work
with results both startling and illuminating, might interest the
Japanese as an alternative approach. For the moment, the most
intriguing aspect of the Nagoya/Boston Museum of Fine Arts project
is that, with the luxury of 20 years to experiment with
exhibitions, it could actually succeed.

THE UNSINKABLE TITANIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ On a recent warm Sunday afternoon, an appreciative
audience at the Civic Opera House applauds a musical with no stars,
a trimmed-down set, and a story that everyone knows so well it
borders on a cultural cliche.
</P>
<P>
   So what are all these people doing on their feet for ``Titanic:
The Musical''?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're applauding the whole show,'' says Kevin Gray,
who plays Mr. Andrews, builder of the doomed British luxury liner,
just a few minutes after the final curtain. ``What makes this show
go is a team effort. Everyone pulling together. If the people who
built the ship were this selfless, it might still be floating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanic: The Musical'' almost suffered the same fate as its
namesake. The $10 million Broadway show (it cost $2.5 million more
than the actual ship), was nearly sunk by the same sort of hubris
that accompanied the liner to the briny deep. But after an initial
pounding by the media and lackluster ticket sales, the musical was
re-rigged and _ powered by the strong winds of five Tony Awards,
the sensationally popular film, and the nearly daily promotion of
the Broadway run by Rosie O'Donnell _ it's now successfully
floating across America.
</P>
<P>
   Before she even left her berth in Southampton, RMS (Royal Mail
Service) Titanic symbolized the grace, wonder, and arrogance of the
modern age. Engineered to withstand all but the most unlikely
blows, the luxury liner represented the biggest, fastest, grandest,
prettiest, classiest, and, yes, safest ship afloat. While she
crossed the North Atlantic on her maiden voyage, the manufacturers
and owners floated on pure hubris. The record shows that an iceberg
sliced the side of the ship just before midnight on April 14, 1912,
off the coast of Nova Scotia, causing it to sink with 1,517 of the
2,228 passengers and crew going down with it. When the unthinkable
happened to the unsinkable, arrogance was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the sea disaster that took down a Guggenheim and an Astor,
along with all the third-class passengers who were locked below,
seems to sail on forever. From James Cameron's Oscar-winning
cinematic spectacle to the touring company of ``Titanic: The
Musical,'' the queen of the White Star Line has taken on mythic
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   When the musical, with music and lyrics by Maury Yeston and book
by Peter Stone, opened on Broadway on April 23, 1997, the icy
critics were prepared to put it in dry dock before it even left its
moorings at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Tipped off by rescheduled previews _ one had to be canceled just
a few weeks before opening, because the stage ship wouldn't sink _
the critics seemed prepared to hate it. The New York Times's Ben
Brantley opined, `` `Titanic' . . . doesn't sink. Unfortunately,
that is also probably the most exciting thing that can be said
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the original liner, which had such an auspicious
beginning and tragic end, the opposite has occurred with ``The
Musical.'' The producers have had the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   They cut back many of the special effects that burdened the
Broadway show. Gone are the smoking coal bins and the elaborate
lifeboat scenes, replaced by suggestive scrims. Leaner, cheaper,
faster. Apparently, the producers also learned a lesson about
hubris.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the actors in the touring company, Melissa Bell, who
plays Kate McGowan, an unwed Irish woman on her way to America, has
had the most interesting perspective. She's been with the show, in
one capacity or another, since that fateful Broadway opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, it was like the ship, we were just going too fast. I
started as part of the swing group,'' says Bell, referring to the
stand-by group of actors that reinforce the cast. ``I had to be
ready to play nine diferent parts. I started as a dancer. But now
there's no dancing. I was in the chorus. But now there is no
chorus.''
</P>
<P>
   Being backstage, Bell has seen the evolution of ``Titanic: The
Musical'' from disaster to hit. ``The reviews were scathing. How
did we go from the worst show in the world to winning five Tonys?
Sometimes there's more hubris on the other side of the
footlights.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell says changes occurred on a nightly basis. ``We lost all the
big technical effects along the way. And with each special effect
we lost, the focus got more and more on the characters and the
music and the story rather than the special effects. The movie had
all the special effects you need. Whole sections would be moved or
eliminated. But it all worked out for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should see my scrapbook,'' she says with her mouth smiling
but her eyes raised to the sky in memory of the disastrous opening.
``I've got all the clips.''
</P>
<P>
   Including the negative reviews?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she says. ``But it wasn't so much the reviews as the
gossip columns. They loved to write things about the Titanic
sinking and those things. They just liked playing with the words
and, I think, they wanted to see it fail. But it didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell smiles. The matinee audience was appreciative today, and
she appreciates that. ``It makes me happy to be part of this
cast,'' she says. ``They tried to sink us but they couldn't because
there are so many great songs and the story's so great. So we won.
We weathered the storm and succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   The original ship's owners, says Gray, ``threw all their
statistics into the faces of the gods and look where it got them.
It's a story worth telling. It's a new angle on the old angle. It's
hard for us to imagine what it was like when an unsinkable ship
went down with Astor and Guggenheim. It would be as if a plane went
down with Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky. While people think it
was women and children first, more men from first class survived
than from second and third class combined.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray, sounding more like the attorney he plays, pleads his case.
``There were 16 compartments. Any two could be breached. In an
emergency, the first four could be breached. So the ship could have
stayed afloat if they hit the iceberg head-on . . . but it was the
near miss that killed them. Legally, they had enough lifeboats. The
law was 20 lifeboats per ship but that was based on the usual
12,000-ton ship. Titanic weighed 46,000 tons. It's funny but her
sister ship, Olympic, had a long and fruitful life. These people
really thought it couldn't sink.''
</P>
<P>
   Since they've already played other cities _ including Seattle
and Denver _ does Gray sense any difference in the way different
areas react to the play?
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain cities have a greater appreciation of class
stratification with old money, old families,'' he says. ``People
who understand that seem to have a fuller understanding of the
show's underpinnings. I think Boston is one of those cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray knows the city, having spent time with the Boston
Shakespeare Company back in the early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had rotating rep then. It was more fun than an actor should
be allowed to have,'' said Gray, looking matinee-idol handsome in
his backstage dressing room. He took a deep breath and returned to
the subject of the famous vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ship was the result of irrational exuberance,'' he says.
``These people really thought it couldn't sink. They could have had
more lifeboats but they used the space to upgrade the first-class
cabins. But the other element to consider is its grandness and
scale _ nearly operatic. The Captain was the highest-paid captain
of his time and came out of retirement to sail Titanic. The state
rooms went for $4,500. How could anything as majestic as this
sink?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a story about class and privilege,'' agrees Taina Elg,
who portrays Ida Strauss, wife of merchant Robert Strauss, who
founded Macy's in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I auditioned for this role three times before I got it,'' she
says, without a hint of animosity. ``They thought I was too old.
And it was a bit risky. They thought I might get hurt.'' She
smiles, implying that she's as tough as they come.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very well-schooled company,'' she adds. ``An
exceptional company. Some of the critics haven't been kind, but
we're doing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Elg even enjoys touring. She's looking forward to Boston for a
pair of reasons. She can visit with her friend, Harvard professor
and theologian Harvey Cox, and revisit the Colonial Theatre, where
she played in the touring companies of ``Gigi'' and ``Irma La
Douce.'' ``Also,'' she adds, ``my son, Raoul Bjorkenhein, is a
graduate of the Berklee School of Music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally understood what the original crew never
understood,'' summarizes Gray. ``It takes teamwork and cooperation,
not ego, to have a successful sailing.''

RETIRED COUPLE SHOULD DIVERSIFY  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  I am 69 and my wife is 67. We are both retired and living
comfortably on my pension and Social Security benefits, which
amount to $45,000 a year. Our home is free end clear and we have no
outstanding financial obligations. Our portfolio consists of
$750,000 _ $600,000 in mutual funds and $150,000 in cash. All of
the funds are with Fidelity: Blue Chip Growth, 13 percent; Capital
Appreciation, 10 percent; Contrafund, 2 percent; Contrafund II, 10
percent; Equity-Income, 7 percent; Equity-Income II, 4 percent;
Fidelity Fund, 24 percent; Growth and Income, 6 percent; Large Cap
Stock, 7 percent; Puritan, 13 percent; and Value, 4 percent. Do we
have too much of our total invested in mutual funds? Do we have
excess duplication of funds? R.F., LYNN, MASS.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I see no big problem having 80 percent of your nest egg in
mutual funds, especially since at this point you don't require an
income stream. But I do think this is a pretty poorly balanced
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   With the Capital Appreciation and Value funds, you have 14
percent of the fund portfolio in mid-cap stocks, and the
fixed-income side of the Puritan holding gives you about a 5
percent position in cash and bonds. The remaining 81 percent of the
fund portfolio is entirely invested in large-cap stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   You could make things easier by consolidating some of the
holdings, but unless these savings are in tax-deferred accounts,
there likely would be unpleasant tax consequences of selling some
of your positions just for the sake of simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   There's a pretty good argument to be made for selling some of
your large-cap holdings for the sake of diversification. For one
thing, you're probably in a tax bracket that's high enough so that
you would profit by owning a fund such as Fidelity Spartan
Massachusetts Municipal Income, the yield of which is free of both
state and federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to analyze your tax situation to determine if
tax-free holdings would work for you. My guess is that the current
portfolio has been providing you with fairly little income in the
way of yield, but with some very substantial taxable income from
distributions. Moving to tax-free and fixed-income investments
should help.
</P>
<P>
   If you can make additional moves without tax penalties, you
should add some international stock exposure, such as through
Fidelity Overseas, and it would also be nice to have some exposure
to small-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   However, Fidelity Low-Priced Stock fund is now closed, its
Small-Cap Selector fund has built a poor record, and its Small Cap
Stock fund, although promising, is still too young to have built a
record. I think I'd wait a bit before making a decision on a
small-cap fund.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, I'd like to see a lot more fixed-income
holdings, such as Mortgage Securities or Spartan Government Income
or Investment-Grade Bond. If you put at least 30 percent of the
fund portfolio on the fixed-income side, it would provide you with
more buffer against a possible downturn in the market.
</P>
<P>
   While you can probably afford to take a long-term viewpoint, and
I agree that domestic large-cap stocks are a great long-term
investment, I also believe that a broadly diversified portfolio
will provide you with greater safety, and probably with substantial
growth as well.

   DVD UPDATE: Sales of the DVD versions of ``A Bug's Life'' and
``Antz'' have led family titles on DVD to almost twice last year's
children's figures. Last year, non-action titles (family, comedy,
romance) made up 13 percent of the market, according to recent data
compiled by industry observers, the DVD Video Group and VideoScan.
So far this year, the non-action genres make up 25 percent of the
market; when Disney begins releasing its classic animation on DVD
in the near future, that figure should climb. Eleven of the 25
top-selling titles this year fall in the categories of family,
romance, or comedy. (The figures are based on sales data collected
by VideoScan from retail locations nationwide, including Best Buy,
Blockbuster, Circuit City, Musicland, Tower Records, and more, but
do not include small specialty stores and mass merchants such as
Wal-Mart and Kmart.) &QL;

WHY `BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER' WAS THE BEST THING ON TV THIS
SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you think this is yet another lecture on how badly you've
been squandering your Tuesday nights watching the wrong show, then
skip this piece and move directly to Travel or some other innocuous
section.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not here to make you feel guilty about the way you've been
ignoring the season's best drama. Go right ahead and watch ``JAG''
or PBS or whatever else that is keeping ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' off your prime-time menu.
</P>
<P>
   In the just-concluded season of ambivalent law firms and Prozac
mob families, of sports nights and everybody's love for Raymond,
``Buffy'' stood alone, and not because the buffed one ultimately
would win in a drag-out street brawl with all comers. Emotion for
emotion, kick for kick, the drama on which the WB network continues
to coast was a sheer pleasure trip.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it time due reverence is paid?
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: No other series this season pulled off a similar
degree of cinematic difficulty with as much consistency, panache
and unpredictability. Not the outlandishness of ``Ally McBeal,''
not the violent domesticity of ``The Sopranos,'' not the
pitch-perfect yakkers populating ``Sports Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Horror, humor, action, romance and adolescent angst _ ``Buffy''
stuffed it all in a zippered sandwich bag. In fact, this year, the
series, created and meticulously produced by 35-year-old Joss
Whedon and starring Sarah Michelle Gellar as the teen-age demon
dethroner, not only improved upon its tricky blend of meshing one
element into the next but managed to get deeper.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for ``Buffy'' has always been how to combine
horror and seemingly normal high school life without making one
seem silly or fake. Each week, it delves into the murky mythology
of the American teen and actually emerges as a hipper mirror of the
teen psyche than those whiny neurotics of ``Dawson's Creek,'' who,
by the way, wouldn't last one day in Sunnydale.
</P>
<P>
   Both shows may wallow in self-aware, brand-name,
psychotherapy-rich banter that can be as annoying as it is
exhilarating. But ``Buffy'' doesn't expect its pop-cultural
references to be taken seriously. (No wonder a character can
appraise a student's outfit and snap, ``I see you've been enjoying
the softer side of Sears.'')
</P>
<P>
   Now I can go all TV symbolism on you here and say that Buffy is
television's outstanding emblem of anti-''Ally'' feminism:
confident, powerful, focused, a character who suggests that fantasy
television can tell stories about women that reality-based shows
like ``Dawson's'' can't.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, Whedon, who honed his tangy dialogue and idiosyncratic
characters writing movies (''Alien: Resurrection,'' ``Speed,''
``Toy Story,'' the 1991 ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' movie),
continues to pull a ``Titanic'' on us.
</P>
<P>
   Like the big boat used as a prop, Buffy's vampire slaying and
saving of the world is merely the background scenery of a journey
that's less about stamping out evil than it is about coping in an
image-crazed culture.
</P>
<P>
   That connection in mind, it's understandable why the WB yanked
last week's explosive season finale in which high school graduates
face annihilation from their commencement speaker, who has
transformed himself into a 60-foot demon. (Though it also seemed a
bit calculated; why, for instance, didn't they pull the first part
of the two-part finale, as well?)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, what Whedon has done is craft a pretty traditional story
of a girl in search of herself, her place among her peers, and the
guy she loves, and merely surrounded it with horrific consequences.
For instance, when Buffy finally loses her virginity to her vampire
boyfriend Angel (David Boreanaz) it would have been no big deal
were it not for a Gypsy curse that doomed him to lose his human
soul should he ever achieve true happiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dates are things normal girls have,'' Buffy complains during
one episode. ``You know what I think about? Ambush tactics and
beheading.''
</P>
<P>
   Whedon is old-fashioned when it comes to heart and story, and he
has made the series about disenfranchisement. Buffy is a social
outsider (OK, a stretch considering Gellar's homecoming-queen
beauty), and we can relate to the pain in her sense of otherness,
whether she's merely the school outcast, the slayer stuck in a job
she never wanted, or the girl yearning for the guy she can't have.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   Buffy is like a harried contemporary working woman who needs to
get through the day without distractions, so that she can have some
energy left to devote to other things. Like homework, dating,
hanging out with friends. (This is a girl who spent her prom night
fighting furry demons and dancing with a guy 200 years her senior.)
</P>
<P>
   Gellar, who has acted since the age of 4 and won a daytime Emmy
as the bad-seed daughter to Susan Lucci's Erica Kane on ``All My
Children,'' plays the slayer with emotional resonance and cheerful
delight. The fight scenes, at least two per show, are shot like
mini-martial-arts movies, with flying fists and vicious leg kicks
and, at times, absurdly exaggerated leaps and flips.
</P>
<P>
   My theory behind ``Buffy's'' continued it's-good-but-not-great
reputation involves the reluctance of critics to see it as anything
more than a comic-book-style series that's simply shrewdly crafted.
It's intellectually safer to champion series like, say, ``The
Practice,'' what with its high-brow morality plays and real-world
plot twists.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the question of whether ``Buffy'' is too gender-
and generation-specific (older adults don't get it when Buffy
accuses her more cautious mentor Giles, played by Anthony Stewart
Head, of ``Scullying'' her hunches). Then there's its home on the
smaller, less-seen network.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, ``Buffy'' ends this season with a weekly audience of
5.3 million, a ranking of 124 out of the 168 programs that aired at
least one episode since September. (In comparison, ``ER'' attracted
a weekly average of 25 million.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the series _ which also stars Nicholas Brendon as the
meek but well-intentioned Xander, Alyson Hannigan as novice witch
Willow, Charisma Carpenter as the spoiled pain-in-the-rear
Cordelia, and Seth Green as the werewolf Oz _ has turned out to be
the WB's strongest show among women 18 to 34.
</P>
<P>
   Whedon, who was raised by ``an extremely hard-working woman,''
takes great delight in giving Buffy strength and such an
independent, underdog spirit, particularly since young women ``are
not overly represented in the cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   Since far too much coverage of hyped shows consists of first
raves and then critical backlash, perhaps we should take solace in
the fact that ``Buffy'' in season No. 3 has not gained the media
stature of an ``Ally McBeal'' or even ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd question whether too much attention would undermine that
underdog spirit of a series working harder to stay true to its
mission. The way I see it, there's something to be said about a
program having an inkling, but not knowing full well, that it's the
best thing on prime-time TV.

BRITISH SAILORS GRATEFUL FOR AID IN `THE YANGTZE INCIDENT'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HORACE CRAIG 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is for the officers and men of the U.S. hospital ship
Repose who served on the China station 50 years ago. It is a story
about surviving British sailors consumed with a desire to thank
someone _ anyone _ remotely responsible for saving their lives.
</P>
<P>
   It began with what has come to be known as ``the Yangtze
Incident,'' in which four British warships innocently got caught up
in the Chinese civil war. Forty-six British sailors were killed,
and 68 others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded credit a U.S. Navy presence for keeping them alive.
</P>
<P>
   The nightmare began when the frigate HMS Amethyst steamed up the
Yangtze River in April 1949 to relieve the British station ship at
Nanking, the Nationalist capital. Communist artillery on the north
bank of the river opened fire at close range, crippling the neutral
Amethyst and causing heavy human casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Going to the aid of the Amethyst were the destroyer HMS Consort,
the frigate HMS Black Swan and the cruiser HMS London. All came
under the same withering gunfire with added damage and casualties
before they were forced to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   The disabled Amethyst was trapped upriver for 100 days. The
other three ships returned to Shanghai, along with the Amethyst's
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The casualties were beyond the ability of shipboard medical
attention, and qualified civilian medical help wasn't available in
Communist-threatened Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. hospital ship Repose happened to be anchored at the
mouth of the Yangtze. Its medical facilities were offered to the
British. My ship, the USS LCI 989, a converted landing craft,
transported the wounded about 20 miles downriver to the Repose.
</P>
<P>
   While playing around on the Internet early this year, I noticed
a call for any items about the Yangtze Incident that might be used
in a special 50-year exhibit at the City Museum in Plymouth,
England. I had photographs of several of the wounded being hoisted
in wire baskets from the deck of my ship up the side of the Repose.
As a radioman, I also had copied much of the distress radio
traffic. I offered these.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks came immediately from John Dunstan, secretary of the
sponsoring Four Ships Association, who invited me to come to
Plymouth for the 50th anniversary memorial.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Loquita, and I (because I was the only former U.S.
sailor present) were unexpectedly called before the Lord Mayor of
Plymouth and 560 crewmen and relatives from the four ships. I was
presented with a framed, commemorative plate in appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, a queue of those who had been wounded formed at my
table to thank me ``for saving my life,'' or ``for giving me such
good care.''
</P>
<P>
   One wheelchair-bound ``boy sailor'' was hit in the chest with
shrapnel and had been paralyzed for 50 years; yet he had
established a successful business and said he has ``had a good
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Another man lost both legs. A former HMS London sailor seated at
my table had been hit by nine pieces of shrapnel. Another survivor
still carries shrapnel in his hip.
</P>
<P>
   Many wanted to know if I remembered a certain doctor or a
particular nurse aboard the Repose.
</P>
<P>
   A moving memorial service was conducted the next day in the
packed St. Nicholas Church at the historic Plymouth Dockyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shall not grow old as we who are left grow old.
</P>
<P>
   Age shall not weary them nor the years condemn.
</P>
<P>
   At the going down of the sun and in the morning
</P>
<P>
   We will remember them ...''
</P>
<P>
   My only part in the incident was on the periphery, a very minor
role. My ship was so small that it didn't rate a proper name, only
a number: 989. I was uncomfortable being the recipient of such
well-intentioned gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   But I accepted the thanks anyhow in the name of those who truly
deserve it, particularly those who served aboard the Repose.
</P>
<P>
   I will keep and cherish the memento presented to me, but I pass
on to those who warrant it the profound gratitude of some British
sailors who owe their lives to a humanitarian offering of care by
the U.S. Navy a half-century ago.

NEW MUSEUM SHOWS OFF BOSTON'S COLLECTIONS, NAGOYA'S AMBITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGOYA, Japan _ If Kyoto is the Boston of Japan, Nagoya is the
Detroit. Kyoto and Boston _ officially sister cities _ share a
historical charm that makes them a magnet for tourists. Nagoya,
bombed into oblivion during World War II, is now a city of mile
after mile of banal buildings, hundreds of bleak high-rises only
occasionally relieved by a low-lying traditional temple.
</P>
<P>
   In this drab context, the $200 million hotel-and-office complex
that houses the new Nagoya/Boston Museum of Fine Arts stands as a
beacon of architectural integrity. Not that it's a great building.
Far from it. But compared with the shoddy haphazardness of nearly
everything else in Japan's fourth-largest city, the shiny white
skyscraper at least looks planned.
</P>
<P>
   The museum itself is the outcome of eight years of planning by
Nagoya's city fathers and the administration of the MFA. Arduous
negotiations, begun when Japan was enjoying an economic boom and
concluded after recession had hit, resulted in a deal with Nagoya
giving $50 million to the Boston museum, and the MFA reciprocating
with 20 years of loan shows drawn from its copious collections.
It's a great arrangement for the Boston museum, which, in addition
to the money and the chance to see long-hidden works cleaned and
conserved for the journey to Japan, has reaped reams of publicity
for being the first Western museum with an Asian outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Is it as good a deal for Nagoya? No, I'd argue. The project is
trumpeted as the ``first encyclopedic museum in Japan,'' which is a
stretch. An encyclopedic museum exhibits art of all, or at least
most, major civilizations at the same time and under the same roof,
so visitors can compare and contrast cultures and centuries. It's
one-stop shopping. Because Nagoya's is a very small museum _ at
just over 10,000 square feet of exhibition space, it's about the
same size as the MFA's Gund Gallery, where major temporary shows
appear _ it will house just two shows at a time. One will be up for
five months; the other, for five years. Over the 20 years of the
contract, the offerings will add up to something approaching
``encyclopedic'' _ but so does the programming of other Japanese
museums, if you look at it over two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Nagoya have free choice among the MFA's collections.
The skeletal, nonspecialist staff of the new museum merely select
from among a list of shows suggested by the MFA. Originally, the
Japanese hadn't asked for encyclopedic programming at all, just for
their favorites: the traditional art of their own country and the
painting of 19th-century France. The MFA responded to the first
request with an aptly named ``Japanese Corner,'' a small space
where Boston will mount concise shows drawn from its immense stores
of Asian art. As for the second, one of the first exhibitions to
fill Nagoya's two larger spaces is a dutiful survey of French
painting, Barbizon to Henri Le Sidaner, one of several
lesser-knowns in the show likely to inspire a ``who?'' response in
both America and Japan. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mediterranean antiquities &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The other inaugural exhibition, ``Art of the Ancient
Mediterranean World,'' was the idea of former MFA director Alan
Shestack, who thought the Japanese could benefit from an overview
of the ancient art of Egypt, Greece, and Rome. At the time of his
suggestion, this particular art was little seen in Japan. But with
the 1997 opening of the spectacular Miho Museum outside Kyoto, that
changed. The Miho boasts such dazzling examples of antiquity that
MFA curators felt pressured to send some star objects of their own
just to compete.
</P>
<P>
   The Nagoya/Boston Museum of Fine Arts is part of a recent
expansionist trend in the museum world. When a museum's collections
or programs fill its own quarters to overflowing, it opens a branch
or two. New York's Whitney and Guggenheim museums and London's Tate
Gallery have all had such outlets for years. All, though, were
domestic. Then, in 1997, the Guggenheim upped the ante and went
international with its spectacularly successful Spanish branch, the
Guggenheim Bilbao.
</P>
<P>
   Bilbao's purpose was somewhat the same as Nagoya's. Both cities
are industrial, glamorless places, accustomed to playing second
fiddle to other metropolises in their countries: Barcelona and
Madrid in Bilbao's case, Tokyo and Kyoto in Nagoya's. Culture,
along with new airports and international conferences, was supposed
to spiff up their images. In the case of Bilbao, the strategy has
succeeded. In an era when a museum's architecture is often as much
of a draw as its collections, Frank Gehry's joyous titanium
pirouette at Bilbao became the most photographed and instantly
recognizable new building on earth. Most gratifyingly, it showed
off the Guggenheim collections rather than overwhelming them, as
people had feared. Bilbao drew 1.3 million visitors its first year,
about a third of them foreign. Along with Richard Meier's Getty
Museum, sitting atop a hill overlooking Los Angeles like an
American Acropolis, Bilbao became a point of pilgrimage. Anyone
serious about the international art scene had to pay a visit.
</P>
<P>
   No one could seriously say the same about the Nagoya museum,
which even its backers insist is intended mostly for the home
crowd. Nagoya officials' optimistic estimate of first-year
attendance is 600,000, with 80 percent of the total local. On the
assumption that the initial curiosity will wear off, the next
year's attendance projection plummets to 330,000. The fact that
half the Nagoya shows will be up for five years may discourage
return visits, as will the odd _ by American standards _ policy
that allows museum members only three free visits per short-term
show. (Visits to the long ones are unlimited.)

AFTER 100 YEARS, SCOTT JOPLIN'S RAGTIME MUSIC REMAINS A CULTURAL
TREASURE
</HEADLINE>
 
(Accompanied by BC-JOPLIN-CD) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One hundred years ago, while Gustav Mahler pushed the symphonic
tradition to monumental heights and Claude Debussy invented musical
impressionism, an equally remarkable event took place in a dark,
upstairs ``gentlemen's club'' for African-American men in Sedalia,
Mo.
</P>
<P>
   There, a young African-American musician who made his living
playing the piano in barrooms, brothels and dance halls fused the
European tradition and the march forms of John Philip Sousa with
the thriving _ albeit degrading _ black minstrel tradition, the
leading popular idiom of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The result was ragtime music _ perhaps the best-known example of
which is the ``Maple Leaf Rag'' _ which went on to become one of
the landmarks of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   And the young musician? Scott Joplin. Between 1897 and 1899 _ no
one knows quite when _ he wrote the ``Maple Leaf Rag.'' In 1899,
the piece was published, becoming one of the most popular and
well-known works written in America. This week, through Sunday,
Sedalia celebrates the centennial of that publication with a week's
worth of concerts at the 16th annual Scott Joplin Festival.
</P>
<P>
   As Edward A. Berlin points out in his Joplin biography, ``King
of Ragtime: Scott Joplin and His Era,'' the origins of ``Maple Leaf
Rag'' are obscure. The club at which Joplin played the piano was
the Maple Leaf Club; whether he named the piece for the club or the
club was named for the piece is not certain.
</P>
<P>
   Why ``Maple Leaf''? Berlin concludes, simply, that the
inspiration was the plenitude of maple trees in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Joplin was born near Texarkana in 1868 _ no one has proved
conclusively whether on the Arkansas or the Texas side. He managed,
in an era of total oppression of African-Americans (slavery had
ended only three years before his birth), to get decent piano
lessons as a child, and also learned to play violin from his
musical father. Joplin's greatest musical influence in Texarkana
was the German-born teacher Julius Weiss, who recognized Joplin's
extraordinary talent and showed him the glories of European art
music.
</P>
<P>
   Though a career in classical music was unthinkable for an
African-American in those days, Joplin as a teen-ager became a
professional musician in the touring dance bands from which the
ideas of ragtime began to emerge. He made Sedalia his home base in
the 1890s, and continued studies in harmony at George R. Smith
College.
</P>
<P>
   And that's how one of the greatest convergences in American
music came about. From one direction came the lively, sassy music
of the barroom, brothel and minstrel show; from another, the
sturdy, reliable structures of Sousa's marches, which were
ubiquitous at that time; and from another, the clarity and
intellect of the Mozart and Mendelssohn that Joplin learned in his
piano lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of composers of the day wrote rags, but Scott Joplin's were
the best, exploiting the sonorities of the piano simply but
beautifully, setting the always surprising syncopated melodies
against a solid, always predictable ``oom-pah'' bass. And there's
something extra, there, too, in Joplin's music: an indefinable,
expressive quality, speaking of a great soul communicating through
music.
</P>
<P>
   A publisher in Sedalia, John Stark, took a liking to the ``Maple
Leaf Rag,'' and agreed to publish it in the fall of 1899. Within
the year, it became a national hit. For years afterward, it
remained a standard item on piano music stands in parlors across
the land, and, in arrangement, for pit orchestras at shows and for
hotel and dance-hall orchestras. For a piece of popular music, it
had remarkable staying power, holding the public imagination until
the 1920s. Joplin followed up with 37 other rags, including the
famous ``Entertainer,'' ``Easy Winners'' and ``Wall Street'' rags;
you could argue all day about which is the best, just as you could
argue about which of Chopin's etudes is the best. They're all
great.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite international recognition as ``the king of ragtime,''
Joplin's life declined into tragedy. His attempts to establish
himself as a producer of opera in St. Louis and New York failed; he
died in 1917, in advanced stages of syphilis. While satisfying the
public taste for ragtime, he wrote two operas, a piano concerto and
a ragtime ballet, and was working on a symphony at the time of his
death. All are lost except for the second opera, ``Treemonisha.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in Joplin and ragtime rekindled in the 1960s, but
musicologist Vera Lawrance had to hound seven publishers before
finding one who would take on republication of the music in 1971.
Musicologist-pianist Joshua Rifkin recorded a selection of the rags
_ now classified as ``classical music'' by the record companies _
for Nonesuch in 1970, producing a surprise hit. Marvin Hamlisch
wove several of the rags into the score for the hit movie ``The
Sting'' in 1973, and ``Treemonisha'' was produced in Houston and on
Broadway. A special posthumous Pulitzer Prize was awarded to Joplin
in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   But, if there was a Joplin ``craze'' for several years, it has
now given way to Joplin as a permanent symbol of American culture,
as entrenched in our national self-image as are Elvis Presley,
Grant Wood and ``The Wizard of Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like Emily Dickinson in poetry,'' says composer-pianist
William Bolcom, one of the leaders of the Joplin revival. ``His
range is small, but many of the rags are perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Composer-conductor Gunther Schuller, who led the New England
Conservatory Ragtime Ensemble during the height of the Joplin
revival, says, ``I gave 1,700 performances of his music, and I
never got tired of it. I could go into a concert after a horrible
day, play four bars of Joplin, and be flying. This is great music,
and it will live forever.''  &QL;

   Scott Joplin's music is well-represented on compact disc;
recordings range from solo harpsichord to brass quintet to a
combination of tuba, flute and piano. Some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   PIANO: For generous selections of the complete rags in their
original versions for piano solo, there's a complete version by
pianist William Albright on the Music Makers label. Pianist Joshua
Rifkin's recordings of a large part of the rags are still available
on Nonesuch compact disc.
</P>
<P>
   ORCHESTRA: Gunther Schuller's authentic orchestrated versions
with the New England Conservatory Ragtime Ensemble are available
under the title ``The Red Back Book,'' named after the original
publication of these versions.
</P>
<P>
   PIANO AND ORCHESTRA: Try EMI/Angel's ``Digital Ragtime,''
featuring pianist Rifkin and the Southland Stingers instrumental
ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   PIANO AND VIOLIN: Composer William Bolcom has said that
sometimes the rags seem to have been written to be played by piano
and violin; violinist Itzhak Perlman and pianist Andre Previn do
just that on ``The Easy Winners and Other Ragtime Music of Scott
Joplin'' on EMI.
</P>
<P>
   OPERA: The flawed but immensely rewarding opera ``Treemonisha''
is available on Deutsche Grammophon, with Schuller conducting the
Houston Grand Opera.

TALENTED TATTLER TERRIBLY GOOD AT WHAT HE DOES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Would someone from Tattler's Anonymous please call and let me
know the time and place of your next meeting? I need to enroll my
baby boy in your 14-step program. (I know it usually only takes 12
steps, but he's got it bad.)
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't know the meaning of the word ``closemouthed.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't know the meaning of the word ``discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't know the meaning of ``privileged information.''
</P>
<P>
   I know, he doesn't know the meaning of a lot of words because
he's just a kid, but things are getting out of hand. I truly wish
that he'd stop taking his self-appointed role as the thorn in his
big brother's side quite so seriously.
</P>
<P>
   I have to say, my youngest man has a talent for telling.
</P>
<P>
   Before he learned his ABCs, he had memorized my work number, my
cell phone number, my pager number and my fax number. He could
track me down better than a Dixie bloodhound.
</P>
<P>
   As time passed, the novelty of his Junior Central Intelligence
Agency wore off, and I had to tell him to stop calling me every
time his brother forgot to cover his mouth when he coughed. That's
when he started sending faxes to my office.
</P>
<P>
   The latest one was typical _ a report on the subversive activity
going on in my own home at that very moment:
</P>
<P>
   To: Monica Anderson
</P>
<P>
   From: Jacob Anderson
</P>
<P>
   No. of Pages: 1 (including cover)
</P>
<P>
   Message: My brother has been using the same face towel for three
weeks. I think that is why he has those little bumps on his nose
and forehead. Please call home and punish him. Maybe you should
give his new basketball to me.
</P>
<P>
   Yours very truly,
</P>
<P>
   The Good Son
</P>
<P>
   I hate to cut him off from this completely for fear that one day
he'll have some really juicy information on his brother and decide
not to give it up. But it occurs to me that there is a downside to
this. If he keeps this up and his interest starts to spread, soon
my husband will know what really happened to that box of delicious,
hot Krispy Kreme doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I guess that settles it.
</P>
<P>
   You TA folks? Please give me a call. If you need my phone
number, just check with my son.
</P>
<P>
   He'll tell you anything you want to know.

OF ATTACK RABBITS AND WHY SUSAN BECAME SIGOURNEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was Jimmy Carter really attacked by a rabbit when he was
president? _ A.D., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: April 20 was the 20th anniversary of President Carter's
encounter with a ``killer rabbit.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Carter was fishing in Plains, Ga., when a rabbit swam
toward his canoe making hissing noises and baring its teeth,
according to press reports.
</P>
<P>
   The president responded by either hitting the animal with his
paddle or by splashing water at it until it swam away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Service having been caught flatfooted _ I'll grant
you an amphibious rabbit assault is a tough thing to defend against
_ the president did what he could to protect himself,'' Cecil Adams
wrote in 1995 in his column, Straight Dope.
</P>
<P>
   The incident did not become public until August 1979, when Press
Secretary Jody Powell let the rabbit out of the hat by telling AP
reporter Brooks Jackson about it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the meaning of Sigourney Weaver's first name? _ J.T.,
San Mateo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A: Susan Weaver was 14 when she decided to take the first name
Sigourney, inspired by the name of a minor character in ``The Great
Gatsby.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old actress comes from a family with an interest in
unusual names. Her parents, former NBC President Pat Weaver and
actress Elizabeth Inglis, named thier son Trajan and almost named
Susan Flavia.
</P>
<P>
   Fans can write to Sigourney Weaver in care of International
Creative Management, 8942 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, CA 90211.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the Elia Kazan movie ``A Face in the Crowd'' available on
videotape? I've looked for it on television, but it never seems to
air. _ F.S., Spencer, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Crowd,'' a 1957 film that stars Patricia Neal and Andy
Griffith, is available from several video retailers.
</P>
<P>
   One place to find it is the Internet movie retailer Reel.com,
which is selling new copies for $16.99 at www.reel.com. Or, call
its Berkeley, Calif., retail store at (888) 707-7335.

WHERE PORK IS KING, THEY DON'T KNOW BEANS ABOUT MAINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's capital, which already has the White
House, the Chinese pandas, and the House Republican managers, is
about to get its own trout stream. Inside. At a shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   L.L. Bean, the venerable Freeport, Maine, purveyor of hunting
boots and chamois shirts, is coming to a mall just a few miles
outside the Washington city line. The 75,000 square foot store
planned for Tysons Corner, Va., will be the beginning of a chain of
Bean stores across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, you say: More evidence of the homogenization of America.
Except for one thing: Even with regional differences seeping out of
American culture, it would be impossible to make Washington
anything like Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Here the preeminent outdoor sport is hiking over to the
Government Printing Office to pick up early copies of the
President's Budget Message to Congress. Here the most treacherous,
winding trail leads from the third floor of the Senate side of the
Capitol to the third floor of the House side of the Capitol. Here
big-game hunting is done by fund-raisers employed by the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Maine Hiking Shoe that Leon Leonwood Bean advertised for
$2.85 (postpaid) in Hunter-Trapper-Trader magazine in 1929 is all
but unknown here; this is the land of a different sort of footwear.
During a late-night tax markup session in the mid 1980s, anxious
lobbyists paced in front of the closed doors of the Senate Finance
Committee hearing room. Senator Bob Dole, at the time the Finance
chairman, was told that the lobbyists were Gucci-to-Gucci in the
hallways (although he allowed as to how they would be barefoot in
the morning).
</P>
<P>
   In my 20 years in exile from New England I have seen with my own
eyes Washingtonians walking on mountain trails in beach
flip-flopssweatshirts;; Washingtonians flopping down demanding ski
trails in the freeze of mid February wearing Florida State
sweatshirts; Washingtonians passing a beautiful spring picnic
afternoon talking about community development block grants;
Washingtonians sitting at the shore with their briefcases;
Washingtonians paying $10 a pound in a grocery store for the most
pitiful, listless lobsters you have ever seen; Washingtonians who
have no moxie and never have tasted Moxie; Washingtonians who think
that a clam roll consists of scrawny little clam necks stuffed in
an untoasted bun.
</P>
<P>
   So before L.L. Bean plants its store in Tysons Corner, it ought
to know the following things about Washington:
</P>
<P>
   1. Thrift is not embraced in Washington, as it is in Maine. L.L.
Bean himself once crusaded for the flinty values that the nation
now celebrates only in nostaligia. ``We wish to call your attention
to the fact that throwing away a pair of used Maine Hunting Shoes
is about the same as throwing away a $5 bill,'' he once wrote,
asking customers to send their old shoes back to Freeport to be
rebuilt. Washington, on the other hand, is the city where the
deficit blossomed, and where the budget surplus that followed was
marked by a remarkable burst of feeding at the troughs by the
porkmeisters of Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   2. The greatest of all New England values, the reluctance to pop
off about something you know nothing about, is not honored here. At
any hour Capitol Hill is full of experts on subjects they have
hardly ever encountered. Representative Perkins Bass, a Republican
who represented the western congressional district in New Hampshire
between 1955 and 1963, was known as Small-Mouth Bass. (His son, who
has represented the same district since 1995, is no talkaholic
either.) Advice to human resources coordinator for the Tysons
Corner Store: Taciturn Maine salespeople will not do. Find a
filibusterer. The locals love a talker.
</P>
<P>
   3. There are no seasons here, at least not like the ones there
are in Maine. But there is election season, and for that the
preferred attire is the blue Oxford-cloth shirt and the red tie. No
one who has ever worn anything remotely like the short-sleeve
hibiscus floral shirt on page 32 of the current cataloghas ever
been sighted in the Speaker's Lobby. Sad but true.
</P>
<P>
   4. It does not snow here, at least not like it does in Maine.
Last March the local authorities closed the public schools in the
District of Columbia after the area was hit by the icy blast of
winter and huge amounts of snowfalls, with drifts approaching
three-quarters of an inch in my backyard. In Maine they say that
``the snow of winter did lie very long upon the ground.'' Here the
``snow'' of ``winter'' lasts for but a few hours. No need here for
snowshoes, except maybe on the wall of a bar, where they might be
mistaken for old tennis rackets.
</P>
<P>
   5. People do not stir here in summer, at least not like they do
in Maine. In his famous elegy to a lifetime of lake summers in
Maine, E.B. White wrote: ``Summertime, oh, summertime, pattern of
life indelible, the fade-proof lake, the woods unshatterable, the
pasture with the sweetfern and the juniper forever and ever, summer
without end.'' Even if a writer of White's read lived here (and
none would), he would never write a sentence like that.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington summer is a lot like a sauna without a shower.
James Russell Wiggins, who was managing editor and editor of The
Washington Post, abandoned the game of tennis and just about
anything else outdoors when he came here. ``When I moved to
Washington I quit doing things outdoors,'' said Wiggins. ``It was
too damn hot.'' Wiggins, who at 95 now edits The Ellsworth American
(circulation 12,000) in Ellsworth, Maine, has a theory that might
explain Bean's marketing strategy: ``Maybe,'' he told me, ``they're
appealing to the people in Washington who are planning to move up
here, to Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   6. Geography and geology have conspired to make the Washington
area recreation-free, and not at all like Maine. It is possible to
get to decent mountains from Washington. It takes four hours. It is
possible to get to a decent beach from Washington. It takes three
hours. This is one explanation for why Washingtonians are so
severe.
</P>
<P>
   For years an L.L. Bean catalog cover has hung in my home. It was
produced in fall 1933, and it is mostly blue, like the times. In
the background is a dog, and in the foreground is a hunter with a
long rifle standing in knee-high boots in the snow. This man has
never been to a food court. This man has never consumed homemade
pasta with spinach, mortadella ham and three cheeses baked in a
cream sauce, nor has he ever dipped his freshly caught fish in a
Parmesean egg batter, flash-fried it, topped it with hollandaise,
and plopped it on a plate with bliss potatoes. (These are actual
menu items from the best-known pub in Tysons Corner, a rifle shot
from the very spot where L.L. Bean will be located.)
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday night I was paddling a canoe on Great Pond in
Rome, Maine. The breeze was brisk, the sky clear. There was an
osprey nest in the tree on the big island. The ducks paddled
quietly. The blue flag of Maine flapped from a pole on the shore.
The water was cool, a hint of March mixing with the reality of May.
It was a real Maine moment, ``under the silent spruces,'' as Edna
St. Vincent Millay wrote in her Maine poetry, ``where the wide,
quiet evening darkens without haste.''
</P>
<P>
   For that Maine moment I felt far from my worries, from my
obligations _ and from the mall.
</P>

JAPAN'S MUSEUM SCENE IS VIBRANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese park art museums in department stores and
corporate headquarters, in Western-style buildings by Le Corbusier
or Japanese proponents of the Bauhaus, and in Asian ones with tile
roofs that curl up at the corners. Their tradition of
open-to-the-public art museums is roughly as old as ours, getting
seriously under way in the late 19th century. And, like ours, it
was greatly influenced by the dour, didactic model of London's
Victoria and Albert. You see that in Japan's national museums,
where, as in the V &AMP; A of yore, objects are categorized and lined
up in cases, without regard to dramatic display.
</P>
<P>
   The current talk in Japan's art world is all about the bubble
economy that burst, the recession that has resulted in art
galleries closing, in sales slipping (especially in the fragile
contemporary market), and in the likelihood that the national
museums, supported since the start by the government, will soon be
cut loose. During my recent visit to Japan, news came that the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art had bought 10 contemporary paintings
by artists including Lichtenstein and Johns from the Fukuoka City
Bank _ for $60 million. A few years ago, the traffic was going in
the other direction.
</P>
<P>
   To put matters into perspective, though, if I hadn't already
known about Japan's recession, I never would have guessed. Japan is
hardly Third World, and compared with the museum and gallery scenes
I've observed recently in truly troubled countries _ Russia, Egypt,
and South Africa in particular _ Japan's seems positively
prosperous. Major museums in Cairo and St. Petersburg seem to be on
the brink of collapse. Roofs leak. Ceilings sag. The national
museums I saw in Tokyo and Kyoto looked in need of paint, and the
lighting is lousy, but you don't feel that the artworks are
actually endangered by their surroundings, as you do in Russia. The
Russians are, by the way, earning money in Japan at the moment,
through a show of paintings from the Hermitage at the Museum of
Western Art in Tokyo. It's one of several current shows in Japan on
loan from Western museums, including one from London's National
Gallery. The Japanese seem eager for a steady diet of Western art.
</P>
<P>
   Recession or no, they're still building museums, even museums of
vision and ambition. Foremost among them is the Miho, a $1.1
billion project outside Kyoto (see accompanying story). The Miho is
an art museum pure and simple. More common in Japan's private
sector is the museum that is part of a larger entity, often an
office building or department store. Westerners trained to think of
art museums as secular cathedrals tend to see this as
</P>
<P>
   sacrilege, but these corporate museums often have impressive
collections and mount their own temporary shows, complete with fat
catalogs. &QL; 
 &QL; 
An international entry &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new entry, and a new wrinkle, in Japan's corporate museum
world is the Mori Art Center. Scheduled to open in 2003 on the 52d
and 53d floors of a new tower in Tokyo's Roppongi district, the
center is the brainchild of Minoru Mori, Japan's largest real
estate developer. Programming in the space _ a European-style,
non-collecting kunsthalle _ will be international. Mori curator
Yukiko Harada is forging links with foreign museums, including
those at Harvard. On her US forays she's visited Cambridge to talk
with Harvard University Art Museums director James Cuno about shows
he might send to the new space. The Mori center will focus on all
of contemporary culture, not only ``fine'' art, but advertising,
animation, and fashion from all over the world. The team of
designers and architects working on the building complex is also
multinational, including Britain's Terence Conran and America's
Richard Gluckman.
</P>
<P>
   A man whose mission is nothing short of imposing some sort of
order on Tokyo's chaos, Mori is an admirer of the utopian planned
cities of Le Corbusier. A Mori proposal to replace single-family
sprawl with 40-story high-rises surrounded by green space echoes Le
Corbusier's 1925 ``Plan Voisin,'' which would have replaced central
Paris with dozens of identical office and residential blocks. To
Americans bred on individualism, this sounds horrible _ but much
more so in the case of Paris than Tokyo, an urban-planning
nightmare where almost any change would be for the better.
</P>
<P>
   Le Corbusier was also a painter, strongly influenced by Cubism
and Leger, and Mori is a major collector of his paintings,
sculpture, and works on paper. At the moment, they adorn a private
club in a Mori-owned building, where the privileged few can enjoy
them. Harada hopes that they'll one day be on loan to the Mori
Center, for everyone to see.
</P>
<P>
   Le Corbusier's only building in Japan, the National Museum of
Western Art, doesn't make me regret there aren't more. For someone
who was a painter, he designed a structure notably unsympathetic to
the display of art. The thick concrete pillars and low ceilings
painted black weigh down the paintings, a cache whose core was
bought between the two world wars by shipbuilding magnate Kojiro
Matsukata. Centered, predictably, on the big names of 19th-century
French painting, the Matsukata collection was held hostage by the
French government during World War II, then ultimately released to
its Japanese prison, designed by a French architect.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's fascination with Western art fascinates Westerners. The
country's passion for Impressionism is legend. Truth to tell, the
Japanese have sometimes bought by name rather than quality,
snapping up third-rate Renoirs just for the sake of the signature.
In Tokyo's Bridgestone Museum, built by the tire tycoons within
their corporate headquarters, is a room filled with the Japanese
version of Impressionism, which shares the same not-quite quality
of America's Monet wannabes.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's relationship with 20th-century Western art is more
complex. The country's first museum to focus on recent art is a
private one. Tokyo's 20-year-old Hara Museum of Contemporary Art is
housed in a converted 1938 Bauhaus-style building by Japanese
architect Jin Watanabe. Its sleek curves and walls of glass brick
make a suitable setting for the international art on view: You'd
never guess you're in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   At the Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo, you see Japanese
artists coming to grips with Abstract Expressionism and Pop, and
coming into their own with their own movements. The museum is the
result of the city recognizing a need _ and then filling it rather
questionably. The building, which opened in 1995, is the kind of
concrete bunker that suits huge installation pieces but is
incompatible with painting on anything but a heroic scale. It's so
far off the beaten track _ a $40 cab ride from the city center _
that it's little visited. The major show I saw there was
photography by Araki Nobuyoshi, whose gritty documentation of seamy
street life and quasi-pornographic pictures of trussed-up women
with their kimonos half off have earned him comparison to American
photographer Nan Goldin _ even though Araki was practicing the
style first.
</P>
<P>
   The West still expects Japanese artists to be exotic, and
somehow recognizably Japanese. Hence the popularity in Europe and
America of Yasumasa Morimura and Mariko Mori, two photo-based
artists whose work stars themselves. It's easy to pigeonhole them
as Japanese Cindy Shermans. On the other hand, in Tokyo's Nantenshi
Gallery, one of the city's best commercial venues for new art, I
chanced on a show of recent, and exquisite, sepia-toned prints of
eerily empty rooms by Ryoji Ikeda. Perhaps because there's nothing
particularly Japanese about their work, artists like Ikeda are all
but unknown outside Asia. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A national context &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Japan's high-speed bullet trains make day trips between major
cities simple. People in Nagoya can see anything in Toyko or Kyoto
and make it home for dinner. So the new Nagoya/Boston Museum of
Fine Arts has to be seen in a national context. Of course it also
exists in the smaller context of Nagoya itself. However drab that
city's image, there are other cultural attractions there. Ten
million people a year make the pilgrimage to Atsuta, the
second-biggest Shinto shrine in Japan, a complex that includes an
impressive museum housing 4,000 designated National Treasures _
swords, lacquerware, scrolls, and kimonos among them. The Tokugawa
Museum, established in 1935, survived the bombings in World War II,
was extensively renovated in 1987, and includes spectacular
displays of traditional arts. As opposed to the straightforward
lineups of objects in most Japanese museums, the Tokugawa mixes
media in vignettes that re-create tea houses, Noh stages, or rooms
in Nagoya's 17th-century castle. The presentation is world-class
and sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   There's a Nagoya City Art Museum, too, a decade-old example of
playful, postmodern, Lego-like architecture, filled with
20th-century collections that range from School of Paris paintings
to, rather improbably, works by the Mexican muralists, to major
pieces by contemporary masters including Anselm Kiefer and
Magdalena Abakanowicz. It turns out that the new Nagoya museum
isn't the only Boston art presence in town. Smack in the middle of
the City Art Museum's double-height lobby is one of the ``Hammering
Men'' of Jonathan Borofsky, a Boston native. He specializes in
giant, generic metal figures, which he's installed in countries the
world over. The blunt, unrelenting, mechanized gesture of the
Hammering Men suggests all the workers of the world rolled into
one. They're a global tribe, their presence in Japan symbolic of
that country's desire for full participation in the world of art.

THE DIVERSE CREATURES OF THE DEEP MAY BE STARVING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hordes of creatures living in the hidden depths of the deep sea
are in danger of starving to death, scientists report. This remote
part of the planet is believed to harbor millions of undiscovered
species, an unknown number of which may be in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   A study of food supply and demand miles down in the North
Pacific between 1989 and 1996 found that creatures of the seabed
suffered from growing food shortages. A likely culprit, scientists
say, is a documented increase in sea surface temperatures during
the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the food deficit continues, it is going to change the
configuration of the deep-sea communities,'' said Kenneth L. Smith
Jr., a biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San
Diego and a co-author of the report, which was published recently
in Science. ``Some species will die out while those that can
survive on a very low food supply will still be able to maintain
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about the creatures of the darkness, much less
about fluctuations in their diets and fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   The sea's inky depths, which dwarf the planet's land masses in
overall size, have been found to support fish, snails, worms,
slugs, barnacles, corals, crabs, prawns, sponges, sea anemones,
brittle stars, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, feather stars and sea
lilies. Scientists estimate the diversity at up to 10 million
species _ far more than the 1.4 million varieties of land dwellers
that have been described and named.
</P>
<P>
   Most animals of the deep rely on a food chain that begins in the
sea's lighted realms, where sunlight is captured by the microscopic
plants known as phytoplankton. The plants in turn nourish a riot of
sea life. Leftovers from the feast, including dead plants and
animals, as well as fecal droppings, produce a constant rain of
organic matter that falls into the depths and feeds the bottom
dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Ronald S. Kaufmann, a former Scripps post-doctoral
researcher now at the University of San Diego, found that the
rainfall of food in the North Pacific had declined over seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   About 135 miles off the central California coast, in a region
more than two and a half miles deep, they measured the rain in
sediment traps, cone-shaped devices that catch falling particles.
The traps were suspended off the bottom at elevations of roughly
150 and 2,000 feet. Trapped particles were collected periodically
over the seven-year study period and analyzed to determine organic
carbon content.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of sinking particulate matter (a measure of food
supply) was compared to oxygen consumption by marine creatures in
the seabed (a measure of food demand). The scientists reported that
between 1989 and 1996 the ratio decreased by more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The findings of Smith and Kaufmann will have far-reaching
implications,'' Ellen R.M. Druffel of the University of California
at Irvine and Bruce H. Robison of the Monterey Bay Aquarium
Research Institute, in Moss Landing, Calif., said of the research
in a Science commentary. ``We used to think of the deep sea as a
highly stable, steady-state system.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Kaufmann said the decline in the food supply might be
related to an increase in surface temperatures during the same
period. The ocean warming, they said, may have prompted a decline
in zooplankton _ tiny creatures that eat the tiny plants of the sea
and in turn become food for a vast web of life. And their
diminishment in turn may have cut the total amount of food that
falls into the depths.
</P>
<P>
   ``A long-term reduction in surface productivity,'' Kaufmann said
in a Scripps statement, ``could severely impact the amount of food
delivered to the deep ocean.''

   &UR; PARROT ENVY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A lady was walking down the street to work and she saw a parrot
on a perch in front of a pet store. The parrot said to her, `Hey
lady, you are really ugly.` The lady is furious!
</P>
<P>
   She stormed past the store to her work. On the way home she saw
the same parrot and it said to her, `Hey lady, you are really
ugly.` She was incredibly ticked now.
</P>
<P>
   The next day the same parrot again said to her, `Hey lady, you
are really ugly.`
</P>
<P>
   The lady was so ticked that she went into the store and said
that she would sue the store and get rid the bird. The store
manager apologized profusely and promised he would make sure the
parrot didn't say it again.
</P>
<P>
   When the lady walked past the store that day after work the
parrot called to her, `Hey lady.`
</P>
<P>
   She paused and said, `Yes?`
</P>
<P>
   The bird said, `You know.`
</P>
<P>

   One Saturday this spring my friends Steve, Rich, Kathy and I
decided to go bicycling from midtown to Riverdale. Kathy, who is
from Sarasota, Fla., has been in New York only for six months, and
she and Rich are marrying in June.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped at the Morris-Jumel Mansion at West 160th Street and
were outside the gates peering in when the curator came out and
asked if we would like to look around. We said we were on our way
cycling, but she said we would be her free admissions of the day,
so inside we went for a very pleasant tour.
</P>
<P>
   We were continuing up Broadway when we passed a couple of
bagpipers, members of the Emerald Society. Since Rich and Kathy
were looking for bagpipers to play at their wedding, we approached
them. They were off-duty police officers and said they'd be happy
to play, but they didn't have a pen to write down their phone
number. One of the officers took a bullet out of his revolver and
used the lead tip to jot down the number.
</P>
<P>
   We next rode across the Broadway bridge and on our way through
Riverdale passed Wave Hill. We rested near the entrance when a
couple of the guards asked if we would like to go inside. Not
really, we said, but the guards said that admission was free until
noon and that they would watch our bikes. So off we went for
another nice tour.
</P>
<P>
   As we were leaving the Bronx, a community affairs police officer
flagged us down and asked if we wanted to register our bikes in the
police anti-theft program. We declined but appreciated her gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Later, I looked over at Kathy. ``You see,'' I said, ``You didn't
believe us, but we told you New Yorkers were friendly.''

   Michael Heim was shopping at Williams-Sonoma on the Upper East
Side when he noticed a fashionably dressed woman awkwardly holding
a stainless-steel colander. Would the colander look all right if
left out on the kitchen counter, she asked the saleswoman. Yes, the
saleswoman said, she thought it would be quite attractive.
</P>
<P>
   The customer then asked what else she might buy that would look
good if left out on the kitchen counter. The saleswoman, obviously
recognizing that she had a customer more concerned with appearance
than utility, happily obliged.
</P>
<P>
   ear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   A man I had never met came to my office seeking an impromptu
meeting with my boss. When I told him that she was out, he asked
whether there was another time that day when he might drop by.
While checking her calendar, I received a personal phone call that
I really couldn't put on hold. I tried to speak as softly as I
could _ it concerned the pain I felt at the recent break-up of a
relationship of five and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   I got off the phone and apologized to the man, who appeared to
have heard some of the conversation. I told him that my boss's
schedule was nearly full, and he said perhaps he'd drop by later.
An hour later he appeared. I smiled and told him my boss hadn't yet
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured,'' he said. ``But it looks like someone is having a
bad day.'' And from behind his back, he brought forth three dozen
yellow roses and put them down in front of me, turned around and
left.
</P>
<P>
   He never returned to call up the favor. He just did it to
brighten a life. And so he did.
</P>
<P>
   _ ANONYMOUS
</P>
<P>
   Recent news stories prompted Susan Thaler to recall an incident
when a friend's daughter was in second grade. The child returned
from school and reported that her teacher, who was black, was
``different from you and me.'' Her mother, hoping to nip any
incipient racism in the bud, explained that all people were created
the same, that no one was different from anyone else. To no avail;
her daughter insisted her teacher was different.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, nearing despair, finally asked why the teacher was
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has eyes in the back of her head,'' her awestruck daughter
whispered.
</P>
<P>
   Fog grounded a U S Airways flight to Richmond, Va., recently and
the passengers in the aircraft at La Guardia were impatiently
waiting for takeoff. After an hour or so, one of the frustrated
passengers announced that she had a few hundred homemade
chocolate-chip cookies she was taking to a nephew's graduation and
proceeded to distribute them to everyone on board. The woman got a
long round of applause and, according to Selma Goldstein, one of
the recipients, the cookies were delicious.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Lydia Page was on a bus recently when a woman of
about 80 tugged at her elbow. ``I don't mean to intrude,'' she said
as she pointed to a store they were passing. Written in bold
letters on the window were PORNOGRAPHY, VIDEOS and one other
descriptive term. ``I know what pornography is, I know what videos
are,'' the woman said. ``But tell me, what do you think they do in
a CD ROOM?''
</P>
<P>
   The driver on the uptown Broadway bus spotted a man entering
from the rear door. Jane Seskin reports that he didn't get angry.
``Sir,'' he said politely. ``Is there any reason you are coming
through the back? Have you forgotten there's a very modest service
charge?''
</P>
<P>
   A young mother and her 8-year-old daughter entered an uncrowded
M train bound for lower Manhattan. A young deaf man sitting next to
the girl was signing to his friend across from him, who was sitting
next to me.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the girl touched the signing man's shoulder and
pointed to her eye, her heart and her mother. The man smiled and
the mother said, ``Oh, I thought it was like this,'' and pointed to
her eye, hugged herself and then pointed to her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The man smiled again, held up his hand with pinky and thumb
pointing up and explained that this also meant, ``I love you.''
They all smiled.
</P>
<P>
   In the subway, with few words, ``I love you'' was expressed
three times among strangers.

   The pope just finished a tour of the East Coast and was taking a
limousine to the airport. Having never driven a limo, he asks the
chauffeur if he could drive for a while. Well, the chauffeur didn't
have much of a choice, so he climbs in the back of the limo and the
pope takes the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope proceeds onto Hwy. 95, and starts accelerating to see
what the limo could do. He gets to about 90 mph, and suddenly he
sees the blue lights of the State Patrol in his mirror. He pulls
over and the trooper comes to his window. The trooper, seeing who
it was, says, `Just a moment please, I need to call in.`
</P>
<P>
   The trooper calls in and asks for the chief. He tells the chief
that he's got a REALLY important person pulled over, and asks how
to handle it.
</P>
<P>
   `It's not Ted Kennedy again is it?` replies the chief.
</P>
<P>
   `No Sir!` replied the trooper, `This guy's more important.`
</P>
<P>
   `Is it the Governor?` replied the chief. `No! Even more
</P>
<P>
   important!` replies the trooper.
</P>
<P>
   `Is it the PRESIDENT???` Replied the chief. `No! Even more
</P>
<P>
   important!` replies the trooper.
</P>
<P>
   `Well WHO THE HECK is it?` screams the chief. `I don't know

   KOSOVO-CLINTON (Washington, Va.) _ Answering critics who claim
that the United States is carrying a disproportionate share of the
costs and risks of the battle over Kosovo, President Clinton today
said that the American involvement in the conflict will ultimately
save lives _ ``including American lives.'' In a Memorial Day
address at Arlington National Cemetery, Clinton said that the
peacekeeping force now being assembled in hopes of escorting
hundreds of thousands of refugees from Kosovo will be predominantly
European. And he said that the reconstruction of Yugoslavia after
the conflict ends would be financed chiefly by European nations. By

   REFORM-JEWS (Undated) _ More than a century ago, leaders of
Reform Judaism declared such practices as wearing skullcaps and
prayer shawls and using Hebrew in services to be the dated relics
of the past, and emphasized instead a focus on social ethics and a

   Canada for Children
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I wish to go to Newfoundland and Labrador this
summer with our son, who will be 18 months old. What child-friendly
activities are there? And do any hotels provide child care? _
Dorothy Bleiler, Englewood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. Gillian Marx of the Newfoundland and Labrador Department of
Tourism, Culture and Recreation, who has two sons ages 1 and 3,
recommended several places.
</P>
<P>
   Bowring Park, Waterford Bridge Road and Cowan Avenue in St.
John's, has a swimming pool, a playground and a pond where you can
feed ducks and geese. Older children might enjoy climbing on the
statue of Peter Pan. Call (709) 576-6134.
</P>
<P>
   Salmonier Nature Park, a 40-minute drive west of the city, has a
boardwalk through a wilderness reserve and injured indigenous
animals that are being rehabilitated, like bald eagles, mink and
otter. Staff members provide programs for children. Open to Labor
Day. Free admission; call (709) 729-6974.
</P>
<P>
   The Fluvarium, on the shore of Long Pond in C.A. Pippy Park in
St. John's, provides a panoramic view of life in Nagles Hill Brook
through nine underwater windows. Call (709) 754-3474; admission
$2.72 (at $1.47 Canadian to the United States dollar), ages 4 to 14
$1.50.
</P>
<P>
   The Ocean Sciences Center of Memorial University, on Marine Lab
Drive, has a touch tank as well as harbor and harp seals. Telephone
(709) 737-3706; admission $3, students and seniors $2.40.
</P>
<P>
   If your son is up for nothing much more than a stroller ride,
Memorial University Botanical Garden, also in Pippy Park, contains
110 acres of cultivated and natural habitat, with an extensive rock
garden. Telephone (709) 737-8590; admission $1.40.
</P>
<P>
   As for accommodations with child care, Ms. Marx suggested the
Winterholme Heritage Inn, (709) 739-7979, in the center of St.
John's. There are efficiency units in this Queen Anne mansion, with
complimentary breakfast and baby-sitting for an extra charge.
Rates: $67 to $122 a night, plus tax.

<P>
   The Canadian Pacific Hotel Newfoundland, St. John's, (709)
726-4980, provides referrals to outside baby-sitting services.
Rates start at $88.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta St. John's, (709) 739-6404, also provides referrals
for child care. Doubles from $105.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on the province, call (800) 563-6353.
</P>
<P>
   Dance in Spain
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be in northern Spain in August and would like to
attend fiestas with regional dancing in Navarre, Aragon and
Catalonia. What's on the calendar? _ S. P. Levine, River Forest,
Ill.
</P>
<P>
   A. The main event for folk dancing in the region during this
time is the Pyrenees Folk Festival, the first week in August in
Huesca in upper Aragon.
</P>
<P>
   In August, several towns have festivals dedicated to their
patron saints, with regional dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Aragon: This region is home to the jota, a bounding, leaping
dance done to fast rhythms. The Festival of San Lorenzo, in Huesca,
is Aug. 9 to 15.
</P>
<P>
   Catalonia: The sardana is usually danced in a circle in the main
square on Sundays. In Amer (12 miles west of Gerona), the Mayor's
Sardana, a ceremony that celebrates coexistence, is Aug. 16. Town
officials and citizens join hands in a long line, rather than the
usual circle.
</P>
<P>
   In Calella, on the Costa Dorada south of Barcelona (not the
Calella farther up the coast), there's a sardana contest each
Sunday in August.
</P>
<P>
   Sant Feliu de Guixols, on the Costa Brava, has its festival Aug.
1 to 4.
</P>
<P>
   Navarre: The jota is also danced here, but to a different tune.
The Feast of San Esteban at Vera de Bidasoa (near the French
border) is Aug. 3, and the feast of San Andres in Estella (about 25
miles southwest of Pamplona) is Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Tourist Office of Spain, 666 Fifth Ave., New York,
N.Y. 10103; (212) 265-8822.
</P>
<P>
   Dordogne Walks
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to go on a walking tour through the countryside
in the Dordogne, but I don't want to go during hunting season. Can
you tell me when that is? _ Kathleen Lobley, Indianapolis, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   A. The Dordogne, in southwest France, is known for peaceful,
rolling countryside filled with farms and vineyards, and hiking and
climbing are popular activities. The region's cuisine features
game: deer, boar, pheasant, partridge, quail and hare.
</P>
<P>
   They don't surrender voluntarily, though. According to the
French government Tourist Office in New York, (212) 838-7800, the
waterfowl season begins in mid-August. Starting around
mid-September, hunters pursue deer, rabbits and birds, and the
season runs to early January.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt to India
</P>
<P>
   Q. For a trip I'm planning later this year, I am interested in
cruise passage between Port Said, Egypt, and Bombay, India. What is
available? _ C.W. Layton, Baton Rouge, La.
</P>
<P>
   A. Cruise ships connect these two ports, but in the months you
mention _ November and December _ you'll have to combine parts of
two cruises (and pay full fare for both) or take segments of longer
voyages while paying the fare for the full trip.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Song of Flower, a Radisson Seven Seas Cruises
ship, leaves from Dubai on Nov. 9 and arrives in Bombay nine days
later after stops in Kuwait, Bahrain and Muscat. On the cruise
immediately preceding this one, the ship stops in Safaga, Egypt, on
Oct. 29, eventually continuing to Dubai. By booking early,
combining the two cruises and booking your own flights, you can pay
as little as $8,590 a person, double occupancy. You can contact
Radisson at (800) 285-1835.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can take part of a longer cruise. On Nov. 7, the Silver
Wind, a Silversea Cruises ship, departs Athens on a 16-day cruise
to Bombay. Along the way, it stops in Alexandria on Nov. 10, after
which it goes through the Suez Canal, followed by stops in
Sharm-el-Sheik, Aqaba, Djibouti and Bombay. But you must pay the
full Athens-Bombay fare, starting at $9,995 a person, double. Call
Silversea at (800) 774-9996.
</P>
<P>
   The Crystal Symphony, part of the Crystal Cruises fleet, leaves
Athens Nov. 3 and stops in Port Said on Nov. 7. From there, the
ports of call are Sharm-el-Sheik, Djibouti and Oman; it ends in
Bombay on Nov. 19. Again, you must pay the full Athens-Bombay fare,
starting at $4,825 a person, double. Call Crystal at (310)
785-9300.
</P>
<P>
   You may do better if you can be flexible about your travel
dates, or can go in the opposite direction _ Bombay to Port Said.
In any case, check with a travel agency specializing in cruises.

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Debut for a Bridal Collection &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Because customers have been asking to order evening dresses in
white or ivory as bridal gowns, Barneys New York decided the time
was right to carry wedding dresses in its Madison Avenue store. The
idea was to have a designer who was exclusive to the store. Vera
Wang, whose bridal wear is carried in the Chicago and Beverly Hills
branches of Barneys, has her own store in New York, so she was not
a possibility. But Richard Tyler was. And so his first bridal
collection will make its debut in Barneys later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been toying with the idea of doing bridal for quite a
while,'' said Judy Collinson, an executive vice president. ``We
thought of Richard because he would be perfect. He manufactures in
the United States. His make is impeccable. And he's very good with
delivery, which is especially important for bridal.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler had a show of his bridal designs several months ago, and
Barneys secured the line exclusively for New York. It will be
housed in a room on the store's third floor with its own seamstress
and a veil maker.
</P>
<P>
   The dresses, in satin, silk tulle, taffeta, organza and lace,
range from unadorned columns to designs with beaded lace, quilting
or bustles. They include a sheath with three-dimensional roses, a
Cinderella-worthy strapless dress with a bouffant skirt of 12
layers of silk tulle, a halter with lace panels down the sides, and
a two-piece dress with a portrait collar. They are being made in
Tyler's Los Angeles workrooms.
</P>
<P>
   There is enough variety in the styling to appeal to brides of
different ages and degrees of sophistication, as long as they can
afford upward of $3,000 for a dress and can wait three months for
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Body by Starck
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Starck is at it again. After achieving fame for
designing hotels and lemon squeezers, he turned to fashion last
year with a one-piece dress-and-tights of nylon and spandex,
designed for Wolford and dubbed Starcknaked. More than 30,000 have
been sold. He has now come up with a version for summer called
Starcknaked Hot, which consists of a long strapless tube with
attached panties.
</P>
<P>
   Like the original dress, the new one can be worn in different
ways, at lengths from micro to maxi. It can also be pulled down to
the waist or hips to be worn as a skirt.
</P>
<P>
   The dress, in midnight blue, two shades of gray and a hot
orange, sells for $325; an accessory kit, consisting of a tube top,
long sleeves and a turtleneck, is $180. They are available at all
Wolford stores.
</P>
<P>
   But be warned: Because of the revealing fit of the stretch
fabric, only the daring are likely to dare.
</P>
<P>
   Paper Looks Back
</P>
<P>
   Paper magazine is celebrating its 15th anniversary this month
with a 24-page spread of fashion photographs from its archives, and
a monthlong retrospective to open on June 22 at the Holly Solomon
Gallery, 172 Mercer Street (Houston Street).
</P>
<P>
   As other unconventional publications have come and gone or
changed their formats (think of Details evolving from an indie
downtown fashion magazine into a mainstream men's-wear book now
owned by Conde Nast), Paper has continued to focus in an
idiosyncratic way on independent artists, designers and performers.
It has grown from a foldout black-and-white poster with a printing
of 6,000 to a 160-page bound, full-color glossy with 65,000
subscribers and a press run of 110,000.
</P>
<P>
   It began with $4,000 and a desire to produce something stylish
with content, said Kim Hastreiter, who founded the magazine with
David Hershkovits and continues to co-edit and publish it with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``David is the word person, and I'm the visual person,'' she
said. ``What Paper is about is finding creative people and pointing
to them. We promote independent culture and independent thought. A
lot of the people who work here are artists. We don't have
traditional journalists. We like people who are fanatical and
knowledgeable about different genres, and we teach them how to
write.'' &QL;

A COMIC TOUCH, BUT NO SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CATHY HORYN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Haute couture, let's face it, is hardly anyone's idea
of a happening concern. Sure, one has the Miller sisters to hold up
as the inevitable example of new blood, and of course there is
Isabella Blow. Ms. Blow _ Izzy to her friends in London, where she
is a kind of muse _ is so crazy about couture that during the
semiannual showings in Paris she will change her outfit two or
three times a day.
</P>
<P>
   But apart from a few rich society figures and the ever-odd
English eccentric, everyone else is screaming ooh-la-la and running
to Gap.
</P>
<P>
   So why are all these fanatically cool people pouring into
Visionaire, the fashion publisher and art gallery in SoHo, to check
out the latest haute couture creations by a couple of Dutch
designers named Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren?
</P>
<P>
   The two men are in a corner talking to Cecilia Dean, a
Visionaire editor who recently was named to the International
Best-Dressed List. And one can see why. Ms. Dean has on a white
pants suit by Viktor &AMP; Rolf, as their label is called. It looks
like any white pants suit, except that it is outlined with a wide
black ruffle, so that Ms. Dean seems to be popping perpetually out
of a dark space.
</P>
<P>
   When the designers showed their black-and-white collection of
stiff skirts and bouffant ruffs in Paris last January, they used
ultraviolet light to create the same effect. Everything white in
the room glowed, including the fashion editor's teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Now 3 of the 17 outfits from that collection are mounted in the
center of the Visionaire gallery. They're on Pucci mannequins that
are wearing ash-blond wigs that have been eccentrically combed out
by Danilo Dixon, a hairdresser, and about $1.2 million worth of
borrowed Vedura jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Standing near the door are Nicole Fischelis, the Saks Fifth
Avenue fashion director, and Lauren Ezersky, who has a fashion show
on cable television. Ms. Fischelis says: ``I wanted Viktor &AMP; Rolf
to do something for Saks. I think they're brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So all these things are not for sale?'' Ms. Ezersky
interjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because talent is so rare,'' Ms. Fischelis continues.
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't immediately learn the answer to Ms. Ezersky's
question, because more people keep trooping in. There is Diane Von
Furstenberg, the designer, and Christian Laboutin, the French
shoemaker, and Shalom Harlow, a model. Ronald van der Kemp, the
Dutch-born designer who's with Guy Laroche in Paris, is here, too.
So are Ruben Toledo, the illustrator, and his wife, Isabel Toledo,
a dressmaker. Someone has just introduced them to Horsting and
Snoeren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love your work,'' Toledo says to the Dutchmen, who have the
shellshocked look of a couple of people from Ohio who've just
stepped out of the Port Authority bus terminal at dawn. They trade
pleasantries, and Toledo nods and says, ``Yeah!''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Ezersky's question is intriguing. Even though Viktor &AMP;
Rolf represent what is optimistically called the ``new couture,''
and have shown their collections independently for three seasons in
Paris, though they will be on the official couture schedule next
month, not one client has bought a single outfit, which costs about
$12,000. That is a relatively small sum in the world of haute
couture, where a made-to-measure suit from Dior, without any
details to speak of, can run $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a client were determined to have a Viktor &AMP; Rolf
creation, she'd have to go to Amsterdam, where the designers are
based. Moreover, she'd have to be able to picture herself in the
clothes _ the very surreal collars rising up like Napoleon
pastries, the almost Victorian silhouettes.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, for their second collection, the one that put them
over with fashion editors and led to their New York invitation,
they created shirts that had literally been blown up with balloons
and confetti. The way the models' heads looked, small and bobbing
above these enormous inflated pigeon breast, it was almost the
reverse effect of seeing a pumped-up bodybuilder in a pair of tiny
briefs. It looked cartoonish.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, not many women can picture themselves in Victor
&AMP; Rolf's exaggerated silhouettes, and that's why the clothes
haven't sold. On the other hand, without commercial constraints,
the designers have been free to express themselves, and in a way,
their overblown shapes are a reaction to Dutch conventionality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion doesn't hold a big value with Dutch people,'' says
Snoeren, who, like his partner, graduated in 1992 from the Arnhem
Institute for the Arts. ``It's all sportswear and second-hand
clothes.'' Horsting adds: ``In Holland, the mentality is you're not
supposed to want to stand out. We made our collections to be
noticed, but it was also a reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the comic brilliance of their second couture show,
Victor &AMP; Rolf have been embraced by the fashion world, especially
by those who look for connections between conceptual art and
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The July collection was really a break-through for us,'' said
Snoeren several days before the Visionaire party as he and
Horsting, both 29, had lunch at Balthazar. They were in town as
guests of Creative Time, an artists group, which had invited them,
along with avant-garde designers like Martin Margiela and Susan
Cianciolo, to be in a site-specific installation at the Brooklyn
Bridge Anchorage. For their exhibition, Horsting and Snoeren
planned to perch like birds in a large cage. ``It reflects the
fashion world,'' Horsting said. ``Who's watching who. Who's in,
who's out.''
</P>
<P>
   But to return to their breakthrough. Snoeren said: ``When things
are extreme, it's really easy to think it is a joke. Of course, for
us it was very serious. But people thought we were clowns.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest collection, their point proven, they moved to more
classic silhouettes. ``To show that we were making serious couture,
we did the first part of the January show in the dark and the
second in light,'' Snoeren said. ``It was like showing we had
conquered our demons and we're ready for reality.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Maybe. Although they seem committed to producing ready-to-wear
as soon as 2000, the only reality they've known is couture, which
even for established houses is a money-losing luxury. Horsting and
Snoeren said they have survived in the six years since finishing
school on a mix of government grants, museum sales and good will.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: In the last year they've been featured in dozens of
magazines, from Vogue to Composite in Tokyo. When Stephen Gan, the
Visionaire editor, decided to have a gallery in his new space on
Mercer Street, Viktor &AMP; Rolf were among the first designers he
thought of. ``They represent a new period of people craving fantasy
in fashion,'' Gan said.
</P>
<P>
   All this attention has been achieved without having a real
product. ``Fashion is not just about clothes,'' Horsting said. ``It
also deals with imagery and marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   His partner added, ``If the name is out there in the world, then
you can apply it to bags and T-shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   Horsting continued, ``You could say that for the last couple of
years our name was the only product we were working on.''
</P>
<P>
   This may sound disingenuous, yet look how successful a company
like Gucci has been using sex and celebrity to sell loafers. Even a
couple of Dutch novices can appreciate that. ``Did you see Julia
Roberts wearing our big blouse in Vanity Fair?'' Snoeren asked.
``She might be coming to the Visionaire party. That's what we were
told.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Anchorage event, with the pair in their bird cage (``The
first thing I can say is they're very brave,'' said Alex de Betak,
a fashion show producer for designers like Donna Karan), Susan
Cianciolo stood nearby and said that she actually enjoys the
commercial side of making clothes _ contrary to what people might
think of someone whose clothes have often been shown in art
galleries. ``I've a million ideas, and I'd like to offer things to
more people,'' she said. ``I just don't want to be me and my
studio.''
</P>
<P>
   van der Kemp of Guy Laroche had a different view. Maybe he was
jealous of Viktor &AMP; Rolf's freedom, he said at Visionaire, glancing
at a mannequin in a ruffled mantilla. ``Once you stop thinking this
way, you lose a lot of your identity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's an impossible situation. Nobody wants clothes.
They want Gap or Banana Republic, or they want something very
special.''

NEW THERAPY BUILDS BONE WITHOUT UNPLEASANT EFFECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Neb.)   (af)  
 By NANCY BETH JACKSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new study suggests that low-dose hormone replacement therapy
combined with calcium and vitamin D supplements may increase bone
mineral density in women over 65 by at least as much as the higher
hormone doses now recommended but without unpleasant side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by researchers at Creighton University in
Omaha, is of particular importance in osteoporosis research because
it helps establish that increased levels of calcium and vitamin D
can enhance the effectiveness of estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Osteoporosis, which often goes unnoticed until a person suffers
a debilitating fracture, is the most common bone disease in
America, particularly among postmenopausal women. Many women avoid
hormone replacement therapy, or HRT, which helps prevent
osteoporosis, because of side effects and increased risk of more
serious complications.
</P>
<P>
   As reported in The Annals of Internal Medicine this week, a
study of 128 healthy women ages 65 to 91 and covering three and a
half years found that those taking only 0.3 milligrams of estrogen
daily showed as much as 5.2 percent increase in spinal bone mass
density.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the lowest dose effective for building bone density
was considered to be 0.625 milligrams. Side effects like weight
gain, breast tenderness and spotting were minimal initially and
disappeared totally within six months, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joan McGowan, head of the muscular-skeletal diseases branch
of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin
Diseases, said she was surprised and delighted when she saw the
paper several months ago. ``Estrogen is less investigated than
people think it is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert R. Recker and his colleagues at the Osteoporosis
Research Center at Creighton's School of Medicine, initiated their
study because they felt complications in hormone replacement
therapy were dose-related and the role of vitamin D in increasing
calcium absorption particularly unexplored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave a little less than half of what was previously thought
of the lowest dose of estrogen to get the effect and boosted the
calcium and vitamin D above levels anybody had ever dosed before,''
Recker explained.
</P>
<P>
   The study revealed that initially more than 75 percent of the
women had daily calcium intakes under 1,000 milligrams. They
received supplements to bring their intakes above 1,200, the
Dietary Reference Intake for calcium for men and women over 50, as
well as vitamin D supplements.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the study, however, cannot be applied to younger
women without additional research, said Dr. Bess Dawson-Hughes of
Tufts University, who has researched the benefits of calcium and
vitamins. The lower levels of estrogen even with the supplements
may not be sufficient to cover the drastic decline in estrogen that
can lead to bone loss experienced in the first few years of
menopause, she warned.
</P>
<P>
   But some estrogen is better than no estrogen, she said, adding
that the dose-cutting might be more pertinent to those who cannot
tolerate more.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. McGowan, who is also a project director of the Women' s
Health Initiative, a National Institutes of Health study of
menopausal women, pointed out that the study did not look at the
levels of estrogen needed to achieve other possible benefits such
as improved cardiovascular health or if lower doses would cut the
HRT risk of breast or endometrial cancer.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREEVILLE, N.Y. _ ``Fleas,'' the textbook states, ``are highly
specialized parasitic insects belonging to the order
Siphonaptera.'' That order name tells it all: Fleas have a siphon,
a Draculian mouthpart that sucks the life blood from whatever
animal their genes have programmed them to latch onto. Or, failing
to find their predestined host, they will dine on any available
red-blooded creature.
</P>
<P>
   Fleas' habits would surely place them among the more repulsive
of living things. Upon landing on their victim, they proceed to
harass, extract blood, induce allergic reactions, introduce
infectious organisms and deposit their eggs on their unwelcoming
host.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny worm-like larvae emerging from the eggs feed
principally on the feces of their parents, who nourish the next
generation with partially digested blood.
</P>
<P>
   Disgusting, possibly, but not to Dr. Jay Georgi, an emeritus
professor at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine,
the operator of one of the nation's few flea farms and the inventor
of a most improbable boon to scientific research: the artificial
dog.
</P>
<P>
   When his flea farm was going full-tilt, Georgi's freeze-dried
fleas were more than worth their weight in gold, fetching $40 a
gram ($1,200 an ounce), or 10 cents a piece live. Pharmaceutical
and pesticide companies bought them to develop flea-control
products and allergy shots.
</P>
<P>
   But the artificial dog _ in effect, a device in which fleas live
and reproduce _ has greatly reduced the farm's business. The
companies that made the farm one of the largest flea-suppliers in
the country bought his artificial dog instead, and bred their own
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgi does not mind. ``Most of the new products on the
market for controlling fleas were developed using my artificial
dog,'' he is proud to say.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, he keeps a ``small population'' of several hundred
thousand fleas alive and breeding for emergencies. ``You never know
when we'll get a call for fleas from some company or researcher,''
he remarked. ``We always have to be ready to fill an order.''
</P>
<P>
   A tinkerer by nature, Georgi invented the device that
revolutionized the flea-breeding business when the grant he had to
work on another costly parasite, the schistosome, was not renewed.
At the time, fleas for research were bred on live animals, mainly
cats and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell's College of Veterinary Medicine, where Georgi worked
and authored a classical text on animal parasites, had six cats
that served as flea-breeders. And while the cats' flea production
was prodigious, the cats were not exactly thrilled and the
harvesting was tedious.
</P>
<P>
   Georgi thought he could come up with a device that would do
better. His artificial dog, modified and patented since his
retirement, is a transparent acrylic box, about 16 inches on a
side, with an electric heater to warm the fleas and the cow blood
they drink. Within the box are 25 cylindrical cages, each of which
can feed 300 reproducing fleas.
</P>
<P>
   The cages consist of an aluminum cylinder filled with blood and
covered with parafilm, an artificial skin through which the insects
feed. Their eggs and feces collect at the bottom in plastic dishes
filled with sand and ground-up dog food.
</P>
<P>
   Every other day, the adults are separated out by blowing on the
dishes, which sends them hoping about wildly. Then, using another
Georgi invention, the adults are sucked into a collector with a
modified vacuum cleaner. Eggs are then transferred to an incubator
where they hatch into larvae that dine on the blood-rich feces and
dog food, then pupate within silken cocoons surrounded by sand
grains where they metamorphose into adults _ wingless creatures
with strong spring-like legs that can propel them up to 7 feet
vertically or 13 feet horizontally, the equivalent of a person
jumping 250 feet up or 450 feet forward.
</P>
<P>
   Georgi figures that one artificial dog can do the work of 104
live ones. If need be, the parasitologist can raise 12,000 fleas in
a day with the artificial dog.
</P>
<P>
   But while he is proud of his invention, the fleas are what
really fascinate him. He marvels at their mouthparts, which are
horizontal, then squeezed vertically to make a perfect feeding
tube.
</P>
<P>
   Observing fleas through a microscope, Georgi produced a home
video of the fleas feeding and excreting and then mating, an act
entertaining enough to be in a flea circus. The male crawls beneath
the female and turns its tail end up to copulate.
</P>
<P>
   As with most other species, the males compete for females, and a
male in the mood will try its best to dislodge another male already
in a copulatory position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very fond of them,'' Georgi said. But, he admitted, ``No
matter how much you love them, you can get bored watching them.
They do the same things over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of warm weather means the height of flea season is
fast approaching. The creatures thrive at temperatures of 80 to 85
degrees, and humidity of at least 75 percent to 85 percent, said
Dr. Michael Dryden, a veterinary parasitologist at Kansas State
University in Manhattan. As a result, fleas are a year-round
problem in the Gulf Coast States, a summertime plague in the
Northeast and Midwest and a negligible presence in the Rocky
Mountain States.
</P>
<P>
   Adult fleas are about 1/16-inch- to 1/8-inch-long with dark
reddish-brown, wingless, hard-to-crush bodies and three pairs of
legs (the hind pair produce those incredible leaps). Their bodies
are flattened vertically or horizontally to allow easy movement
between the hair, fur or feathers of their hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide there are in fact about 1,350 different species of
fleas that specialize on various birds and mammals. Pet owners _
and those who bought homes previously occupied by a flea-infested
pet _ are most familiar with the cat flea, the flea that is usually
found on domestic dogs as well as cats.
</P>
<P>
   Adult fleas wisely select feeding sites where their hosts are
unable to scratch, typically the base of the tail and between the
shoulder blades. Given the opportunity, fleas could easily become
ubiquitous pests that inhabit every nook and cranny on earth. Under
ideal conditions, in just one month 10 female fleas can generate a
quarter of a million fleas in various life stages.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Pet owners struggling to get rid of fleas are often warned that
the parasite spends most of its life off the animal, and that
treating the animal's environment is as important as treating the
animal itself. However, thanks to a discovery in the late 1980s by
Dryden, it is now possible to control fleas without poisoning the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Dryden showed that once they sink into a blood supply, adult
fleas hang on to the animal for life. Even though the other stages
a flea's life cycle are spent off the animal, the new flea control
products, which include insect growth regulators and
skin-penetrating insecticides that are used only on the infested
animal, are able to interrupt the flea's life cycle by killing off
adult fleas when they seek their blood meal.
</P>
<P>
   Each fertile female lays about 15 to 20 eggs a day that lie
loosely on the animal's coat and drop off almost anywhere,
especially where the animal rests, sleeps or nests. Eggs can be
found in upholstered furniture, bedding, carpets and in crevices
and cracks on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   In two days to two weeks the eggs hatch into blind,
light-avoiding larvae, which molt twice within a week to several
months before spinning a cocoon. The adults form in the cocoon in
about five to 14 days. If conditions are right, they may emerge
right away, or they may remain in their silken womb for months
until they detect vibrations, pressure, warmth, noise or carbon
dioxide that indicate a blood meal is near.
</P>
<P>
   Adult fleas can live for a year without feeding, but will dig in
the moment a likely meal appears. That is why people are often
viciously attacked by hordes of blood-thirsty fleas when a family
returns home from a long vacation or someone moves into a house
that was empty for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Georgi said that one Cornell professor, upon returning from
vacation, would send his dog in first for a few hours to feed the
resident fleas before he entered the home. In warm climates, fleas
can live outdoors year-round. The so-called sand flea that people
encounter on vacation beaches is nothing more than a common flea
that is breeding outdoors in the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Fleas are more than annoyances. About 15 percent of dogs, cats
and people who are preyed upon by fleas develop an allergic
reaction _ a maddening itch at the site of the tiny red ``bite''
surrounded by a red halo or in some people a generalized allergic
dermatitis characterized by intense itching and swelling. A puppy
or kitten heavily infested with fleas can actually die of anemia.
</P>
<P>
   Before the new flea-control products arrived on the market
claiming to control flea allergy, the Heska Corp., a veterinary
biotechnology company in Fort Collins, Colo., was working on
allergy shots for flea-tortured pets.
</P>
<P>
   Using an adapted artificial dog, researchers collected spoonfuls
of flea saliva from the feeding membranes, identified the protein
allergens in the spit, cloned the genes that produce those proteins
and were preparing to test the effectiveness of desensitization
shots in cats and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Grieve, the company's chief executive, said the project
was ``suspended, though not abandoned.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleas also spread disease, both to pets and people. Most common
in domestic animals and an occasional unfortunate human is the
tapeworm. Flea larvae, which have chewing mouthparts and
nondiscriminating appetites for anything organic, can feed on
egg-filled tapeworm segments that escape through the anus of an
infested animal.
</P>
<P>
   The eggs hatch into larvae in the adult flea. Then, when a dog
or cat swallows a flea in the process of grooming, the tapeworm
larvae are consumed and invade the animal's digestive tract.
Children too may get tapeworms after accidentally consuming parts
of tapeworm-carrying fleas.
</P>
<P>
   More serious ailments transmitted by fleas include bubonic
plague, a disease that is endemic in the American Southwest where
it is spread primarily by the oriental rat flea from rodent to
rodent and from rodent to humans, although 30 other flea species
can also transmit the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The oriental and northern rat fleas transmit murine typhus fever
among rodents and from rodents to people. Fleas are also carriers
of tularemia, a disease related to plague that originates in
cottontail rabbits in the east and jack rabbits in the west.
</P>
<P>
   For those interested in assessing the seriousness of an indoor
flea infestation, researchers offer this technique: Put on a pair
of light-colored trousers and tuck them into white socks. Then
enter the area in question for exactly one minute. If five or more
fleas have landed on the person's legs, the infestation is severe.
</P>
<P>
   Flea experts at Colorado State University say that chemical and
ultrasonic flea collars are ineffective at controlling fleas. But
the newer products, which include insect growth regulators and
insecticides that disperse in the animal's skin or get into the
blood, work far better than flea powders, shampoos and sprays in
keeping pets free of fleas.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Timber wolves from Canada are unlikely to recolonize the
northeastern United States on their own, leaving the politically
more contentious course of deliberate reintroduction as the best
strategy for restoring the wild wolf's howl to the region, a new
study sponsored by New York's Wildlife Conservation Society has
found.
</P>
<P>
   While there are corridors of natural habitat through which
wolves from southern Quebec might move into Maine, the study found,
many barriers inhibit their passage, most importantly legal hunting
and trapping, which have long been a way of life in that region of
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty intense gantlet they would have to run'' to
survive in numbers sufficient to establish a permanent population
in the United States, said Dr. William Weber of the Wildlife
Conservation Society, formerly the New York Zoological Society.
Weber was one of four authors of the study, which appears in the
current issue of the Wildlife Society Bulletin, a scientific
journal.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a few lone wolves were to succeed in filtering into the
northeastern states, the study found, they might well mate with the
region's abundant coyotes. This could create a hybrid population in
which the wolf gene pool would eventually be swamped, defeating the
very purpose of recolonization. Artificially reintroducing intact
wolf packs might overcome that difficulty, some scientists believe,
since packs tend to kill coyotes rather than breed with them.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation organizations, led by the Washington-based
Defenders of Wildlife, have been pressing for the re-establishment
of timber wolves in northern New England or the Adirondacks or
both, where they were once plentiful but have been extinct for
about a century.
</P>
<P>
   The new study ``says what we have felt all along, that natural
colonization probably isn't highly likely,'' said Nina Fascione,
the director of species conservation for the Defenders of Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Although wolves are plentiful in Canada and Alaska, several
species of them have long been legally protected as endangered or
threatened in the contiguous 48 states, where populations numbering
in the thousands were hunted to the verge of extinction, or beyond,
well into the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Today, gray wolves are on the rebound in two former American
strongholds, the Northern Rockies and the upper Great Lakes. More
than 30 packs totaling 400 to 500 wolves now inhabit large areas of
Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, mostly because wolves artificially
introduced from western Canada in 1995 and 1996 have rapidly
reproduced. Some 2,500 wolves now live in Minnesota, Wisconsin and
Michigan, where they always lived.
</P>
<P>
   The Midwestern and Western wolves are doing so well, in fact,
that federal officials plan to remove the Great Lakes population
from the protected list soon and hope they will be able to follow
with the newly re-established Northern Rockies population in two or
three years. The Mexican wolf is also being restored to the
Southwest, albeit with much difficulty, and the red wolf has been
re-established in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these efforts, according to the new study and
others, the wolf population of the United States outside Alaska has
doubled and the wolf's range has nearly tripled.
</P>
<P>
   Now federal officials are turning their attention to the
Northeast. After the plan to reclassify some wolves under the
Endangered Species Act is published in the Federal Register for
public comment, perhaps next month, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service will begin putting together a recovery plan for wolves in
the Northeast, said Paul Nickerson, a wildlife biologist who heads
the agency's regional office of endangered species in Hadley, Mass.
All recovery options will be considered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the standpoint of conserving biological diversity, the
basic rationale for re-establishing wolves in the Northeast could
be strengthened by recent genetic studies by Canadian scientists.
Their findings, not yet published, suggest that the timber wolf of
eastern Canada and formerly of the eastern United States, long
considered a subspecies of gray wolf, is in fact a separate species
and may be more closely related to the red wolf than the gray.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of wolf recovery say that restoring wolves would help
to re-establish natural ecological relationships long sundered in
the Northeast. For instance, wolves prey on moose, which are too
big for coyotes. Moose have flourished in northern New England,
both because there are no predators and because logging has created
ideal second-growth habitat for them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Wolves, which along with cougars were historically the region's
top predators, might restore some natural equilibrium with moose,
say the advocates, just as they might help control runaway deer and
beaver populations. In addition, the carcasses of animals killed by
wolves provide food for scavengers that are essential elements of a
complete ecosystem. Moreover, wolves have acquired a certain
cachet, as their new popularity in Yellowstone testifies, and
proponents say they bring in tourist dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents, as they did in the West, argue that wolves would
prey on livestock. There have been some attacks in the West, and
owners of the livestock have been compensated from a special fund
set up by the Defenders of Wildlife. In Idaho and around
Yellowstone, owners are allowed under federal rules to shoot wolves
they see attacking livestock, and some have been legally killed.
Some opponents also fear that wolves might attack people, but
experts on wolves say that they strongly fear humans and avoid
them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fascione said that for her, the possibility of interbreeding
between wolves and coyotes was the biggest concern about the
success of wolf restoration in the Northeast. Her organization,
which has been instrumental in the Northern Rockies wolf
restoration, is completing its own two-part study of restoration in
the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier study sponsored by the Wildlife Conservation Society,
in 1997, concluded that the Adirondacks were too removed from
Canadian wolf packs for any natural recolonization to take place.
It also found that the Adirondacks had little more than half the
area needed to sustain a wolf population. If wolves were put into
the Adirondacks, Weber said in a recent interview, they would
probably expand into more of upstate New York and neighboring New
England.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 study found that northern New England was a better bet
than the Adirondacks for both natural colonization and for
providing sufficiently extensive habitat. It also identified two
possible corridors near Quebec City along which wolves could
disperse from Quebec into Maine. The authors of that study said,
however, that further investigation would be required to determine
whether wolves were actually likely to move along the corridors.
</P>
<P>
   The new study found that highways, railroads and the St.
Lawrence River posed formidable barriers across these corridors. It
also concluded that intensive hunting and snaring, coupled with
negative attitudes toward wolves, would further inhibit their
spread. Moreover, the study found, hunting and trapping had reduced
the wolf population of southern Quebec enough to lessen the
pressure on wolves to migrate to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The authors said that natural colonization remained a
possibility if Canada and the United States worked together to
protect wolves in the dispersal corridors. It also noted that any
reintroduction of wolves to the northeastern United States would
require Canadian cooperation, since the wolves would probably
spread into New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any restoration in New England has to be done with binational
cooperation,'' Ms. Fascione said.

TURBULENT TIMES FOR TOURISM IN GREECE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., June 6) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With tourism throughout the Balkans suffering as a result of the
air war against Yugoslavia, it was perhaps inevitable that Greece
would be among the victims. But travel agents and tour operators
say that a bad regional situation has been made considerably worse
by a spate of terrorist attacks in and around Athens. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks the residence of the Dutch ambassador was
damaged by a bomb, and a rocket was fired at the German
ambassador's residence. Three western banks in the port of Piraeus,
just outside the capital, were also hit by rockets. A Greek woman
was killed by a bomb at the Athens Intercontinental Hotel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been left speechless,'' Dimitris Andoniou, president
of the Union of Greek Travel Agencies, said after the April 29
hotel bombing. ``First the war and now this. It will be many years
before we see American tourists.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the attacks have been attributed to a far-left group
bitterly opposed to the NATO operation in Serbia, which it
described in one statement as the work of ``euro-Atlantic assassins
and their chief, Clinton.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The State Department issued an announcement on April 29 ``urging
American citizens traveling to or residing in Greece to exercise
appropriate security precautions and avoid demonstrations.'' In
response, the Greek government's principal spokesman, Dimitris
Reppas, said: ``We do not think this initiative by the United
States is correct.'' He said it ``could create many problems,
especially for tourism in our country.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is big business in Greece. Last year about 12.5 million
foreigners came to Greece for holidays, a 10 percent increase over
the previous year, and spent nearly $7 billion. But growing numbers
of tourists are avoiding the country. Some Europeans are switching
to destinations in Spain or Portugal. British charter operators
have cut the prices of flights to Greece in an attempt to woo
customers back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans are also having second thoughts. ``We have
cancellations,'' said Michalis Ghiolman, an Athens travel agent who
specializes in arranging tours for visiting Americans. ``Even
Greek-Americans are afraid to come.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Northern Greece, which borders on Albania and Macedonia, has
been especially hard hit. Proximity to the war zone is one concern,
but environmentalists have also warned that the bombing of
pharmaceutical plants, oil refineries and fertilizer depots in
Serbia could release poisonous dioxins into the air. Some residents
of northern Greece have begun stockpiling food and water. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to published reports, half a million tourists have
canceled trips to northern Greece in recent weeks. The area is
especially popular with budget-minded travelers from Poland, the
Czech Republic and Hungary. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cruise lines, which normally do a brisk business cruising the
Greek islands in the Aegean, are also hurting. Orient Lines, which
is based in Florida, recently sent letters to American travel
journalists inviting them to join a cruise from Athens to Istanbul
``to see for yourself that cruising the Greek isles is still a safe
and viable vacation option for summer/fall 1999.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The handful of terrorist attacks in Greece is having an effect
similar to that produced by a spate of attacks in neighboring
Turkey earlier this year. Visitors to both countries report feeling
quite safe, although some who have gone to Greece recently say they
have experienced disturbing instances of anti-Americanism.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Opinion surveys show that Greeks are overwhelmingly opposed to
the NATO operation in Yugoslavia, and anti-NATO emotions are
running high. Many Greeks sympathize with the Serbs, with whom they
share the Orthodox Christian faith, and blame the United States for
conceiving and directing the bombing campaign aimed at Serbia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some recent protests in Athens have ended with the burning of
American flags. Major newspapers portray NATO as the perpetrator of
atrocities while giving little coverage to the campaign of ethnic
cleansing that Serbs are waging in Kosovo. A group of mayors on
Crete issued a statement saying that the 450 American military
personnel stationed there were no longer welcome and that their
safety could not be guaranteed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Burns, the American ambassador to Greece, urged
citizens of both countries ``to keep our disagreements rational, to
keep our disagreements proportional and to avoid demonizing each
other.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One travel agent in New York who arranges tours to both Greece
and Turkey, Suzanne Hall of IST Cultural Tours, said her Greek
business is slumping, though not as badly as her Turkish business. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just had two new requests for tours to Greece, so maybe
things are starting to pick up,'' Ms. Hall said. ``But in general,
business is definitely off. The big problem isn't the hotel
bombing, which didn't get much coverage in the American press.
Kosovo is what they're afraid of. People are worried, and the
region as a whole is suffering.'' &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   As spacecraft go, it is small, inexpensive and normally would
hardly stand out among the dozens of satellites and probes NASA is
planning to send into space. But Triana, because of its unusual
origin and mission, has attracted a lot of attention. And it is in
trouble because of it.
</P>
<P>
   The goals of this simple satellite, designed to view the Earth
from afar, have become complicated by the reality of Washington
politics. The debate over whether the mission is a good idea or not
is muddled by the awareness of whose idea it was in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Triana, in its earliest incarnation, is the brainchild of Vice
President Al Gore. In a speech on March 13, 1998, at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Gore challenged NASA to
build and fly an inexpensive spacecraft that would make continuous,
live pictures of the full, sunlit Earth from far out in space that
would be available to the world at all times via the Internet and
television.
</P>
<P>
   Weather and scientific satellites view the Earth all the time,
but they orbit so close that they only see a portion of the planet
at a time. Any ``whole Earth'' view has to be stitched together
from several images and none of these displays can be done in real
time.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that seeing the entire Earth against the blackness of
space at any time, which is not now possible, would inspire
environmental consciousness and encourage new educational and
scientific efforts. As the nation's classrooms and homes are
connected to the Internet and cable television, he said, the images
could arouse new feelings among millions of Americans about their
home planet.
</P>
<P>
   As White House aides tell it, Gore's idea came to him almost in
a dream. He awoke at 3 a.m. one day in February 1998, and thought
about a global view of Earth, they say, perhaps inspired by the
famous ``Blue Marble'' photograph of the planet taken in December
1972 by the returning crew of Apollo 17, the last moon mission. A
copy of the picture hangs in Gore's office.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also gave the Earth-watching project its name, after
Rodrigo de Triana, the lookout aboard Christopher Columbus' ship
who first saw the New World in 1492.
</P>
<P>
   After Gore told the NASA administrator, Daniel S. Goldin, about
the idea and asked if it was feasible, the agency made a quick
study of the proposal and concluded that it could be done for
between $20 million and $50 million. But after NASA asked for bids
on the project, it grew from a simple camera-in-space idea _
nicknamed by some the ``Gorecam'' or ``Goresat'' _ to a more
elaborate spacecraft that would also do environmental monitoring of
the Earth and the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, after an evaluation of nine competing proposals,
the agency selected one from the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography at the University of California at San Diego for a $75
million mission.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of just a video camera for taking pictures of the Earth,
the Scripps mission includes a multi-spectral imager that sees a
variety of wavelengths of light, from ultraviolet to near infrared,
to measure ozone, cloud height, the amounts of aerosols and
particulates suspended in the air, and other parameters.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes a radiometer for monitoring the solar radiation
reflected back into space by Earth and an instrument package for
monitoring solar events that could affect electrical equipment on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``By no means is this the `Gorecam,''' said Dr. Francisco P.J.
Valero, director of the Atmospheric Research Laboratory at Scripps
and principal investigator for Triana. ``We wouldn't get into this
unless there is good, substantial science. We will be looking at
the planet in a way it has never been looked at before.''
</P>
<P>
   But as interest in Triana grew, so did opposition from some
space scientists concerned about diminishing NASA budgets and
politicians on Capitol Hill, particularly Republicans. NASA found
$35 million in its fiscal 1999 budget to begin the project, but ran
into renewed opposition this spring in trying to get $32 million
for Triana for the 2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   On May 13, the Republican-controlled House Science Committee
voted 21 to 18 along party lines to send a $41.2 billion,
three-year NASA authorization bill to the full House without Triana
financing. The measure included an amendment by Rep. Dave Weldon,
R-Fla., who called Triana ``a multimillion-dollar screen saver''
and ``tripe science,'' that shifted money for the project to other
research.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking against Weldon's amendment, Rep. Bart Gordon, D-Tenn.,
accused Republicans of attacking Triana in a partisan effort to
hurt Gore's presidential aspirations while ignoring the scientific
and educational uses of the program.
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, when the House considered the NASA financing bill,
Republicans attacked the project, with the majority leader, Dick
Armey of Texas calling it a ``far-out boondoggle'' and Rep. F.
James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, branding it ``the vice
president's late-night inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 259-168 to pass the measure without Triana
financing. Democratic leaders said they would ask their Senate
colleagues to reinsert money for Triana this summer when conference
committees of both houses meet to reconcile their spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, White House and NASA aides said Goldin might
recommend a presidential veto of a final agency spending bill that
did not include Triana.
</P>
<P>
   If Triana survives the budget wars, there is still discussion
among scientists on what the spacecraft will do and how valuable a
scientific contribution it can make.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft is scheduled for launching from a space shuttle
during a flight in December 2000. After a six-month journey, it is
to enter an orbit about a million miles from Earth at a point
called Lagrange 1. At this point, the gravitational pulls of the
Sun and the Earth balance one another, leaving a spacecraft to
match the Earth's track around the sun. There are several
spacecraft already at Lagrange 1, but they all face the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Triana would always have the sun at its back and its face toward
the sunlit side of Earth turning beneath it. There it would
constantly image the planet. Several times a year, Triana would
take detailed pictures of the far side of the moon, fully lighted
by the sun, as it passed between Triana's camera and Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Valero, the project's principal scientist, said Triana would be
the first craft to study Earth's energy balance and how it affects
climate. The planet absorbs energy from the sun that drives its
weather and climate, but it also reflects an unknown amount of
energy into space. The instruments would also track clouds and the
types of particles in them to see how they affect energy exchanges
in the atmosphere and how much potentially harmful ultraviolet
radiation reaches Earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have thought about doing science like this for years, and
now it's possible,'' Valero said. ``A lot of thought has gone into
these experiments. Science like this does not come out of a
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is disagreement about the project's worthiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you went to the scientific community and asked what is
needed most for Earth science, this would not be it,'' said Dr.
Richard S. Lindzen, a professor of earth, atmospheric and planetary
science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``I don't see
a big benefit to science coming out of this. This is a strange way
to go about designing a project, starting with the vice president
having a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindzen said that if NASA wanted to devote part of its resources
to public relations, the agency might be justified in doing so. But
he said it should not call these projects ``science'' or devote too
much of its limited funds to them.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven C. Wofsy, a professor of atmospheric sciences at
Harvard University, says he was initially very skeptical about the
Triana proposal, but now says believes it may produce useful
science. He is not involved with the project, but serves on a
scientific committee that was briefed on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed by how carefully thought-out the experiments
were,'' Wofsy said. ``These people were determined to make
something out of it and they did. It's more than a world-cam, which
no one needs, and offers potentially unique results.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald Johnson, a retired professor of atmospheric sciences
at the University of Wisconsin who is now with the Universities
Space Research Association, says he can understand why some people
oppose Triana because of its political origins or its use of money
that could go to other projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes with some political baggage,'' he said, ``but it
still can be useful.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from any scientific payoff, he said, continued monitoring
of Earth can attract attention to the planet's problems globally
and be a useful educational tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some value in just making people aware of their
world,'' Johnson said.

<P>
   Experimental restoration of the gray wolf to Montana, Idaho and
Wyoming has been so successful since 1995, federal officials say,
that the first steps toward a single, integrated wolf population in
the Northern Rockies have now been taken.
</P>
<P>
   In the Yellowstone area, where wolves have been most visible to
wildlife enthusiasts, there are now about 110 adult wolves and
roughly 60 newborn pups organized into 11 or 12 packs, said Edward
E. Bangs, a biologist with the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service
who heads the Northern Rockies recovery program. The wilderness of
central Idaho is home to at least 12 packs with about 115 adults
and 60 to 65 pups.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian wolves were introduced to these two areas in 1995 and
1996, and natural reproduction has steadily expanded their
populations since then.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 8 packs with about 60 adults and some 50 pups now
inhabit northwestern Montana as a result of natural southward
expansion of wolves from Canada that began in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 percent of the wolves die each year from various
causes, including starvation, predation by mountain lions, auto
collisions, avalanches, old age and gunshots. Most of the latter
killings were done legally, after wolves preyed on livestock.
</P>
<P>
   Just as significant as their numbers is the fact that in at
least two instances, wolves from different populations have mated,
making a genetic connection that could be the foundation for a
single Rockies population.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time since the reintroductions, wolves have
taken up territories well outside Yellowstone Park in the last
year. One pack each has established itself near Cody, Dubois and
Jackson, all in Wyoming, some 50 miles from the park boundary. The
Jackson pack has adopted the National Elk Refuge as its winter
hunting ground. One could sit in Jackson this winter, ``sipping
your latte and watching nature at work'' as the wolves hunted down
elk, Bangs said.
</P>
<P>
   In another ecological milestone, he said, one Yellowstone pack
has learned to attack and kill bison in the park and is now
something of a bison specialist. The Yellowstone wolves generally
have concentrated on the park's abundant elk population.
</P>
<P>
   From 1995 through 1998, 80 cattle, 190 sheep and 12 dogs were
confirmed victims of the Northern Rockies wolves. Nearly $70,000 in
compensation was paid to the affected owners from a fund maintained
by the Defenders of Wildlife, according to a report by Bangs and
others in the current issue of the Wildlife Society Bulletin.
Forty-seven wolves were moved after depredations, and 43 marauding
wolves have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, according to the report, livestock producers in
Montana alone lose an average of 142,000 sheep and 86,000 cattle,
valued at $45 million year, to all causes each year.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court has decided that the rules under which
reintroduced wolves can be killed violate the Endangered Species
Act and has ordered all the wolves removed from Central Idaho and
Yellowstone. The case is now on appeal. As a practical matter,
Bangs said, the wolves are now so numerous and well-established
that removing them would be a problem. ``You could remove all the
wolves,'' he said, ``but you couldn't catch them all alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the wolves born after the initial reintroductions are
not wearing radio collars and would be hard to find. ``To recapture
all of them would be very difficult,'' Bangs said.
</P>
<P>
   If the restoration program survives the court challenge, the
Northern Rockies wolf population can be removed from protection
under the Endangered Species Act when there have been at least 100
wolves and 10 packs in each of the three recovery areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dad-gum close to the countdown'' to that day, said
Bangs.

   It's amazing what can be done with a little bit of Scotch tape.
Take, for example, the work of a team of researchers in creating a
kind of artificial muscle out of a piece of double-stick.
</P>
<P>
   It helps, of course, that attached to both sides of the tape are
sheets of single-walled carbon nanotubes, cylindrical molecules
with walls that are one atom thick. Carbon nanotubes, which were
discovered less than a decade ago, are among the star materials in
the growing research into development of molecular-scale
manufacturing devices.
</P>
<P>
   In the current research, reported in the journal Science,
scientists from Allied Signal and several universities put a
nanotube-tape-nanotube sandwich in an electrolyte (in one case,
simply a beaker of salt water) and applied a charge to one side.
</P>
<P>
   The nanotubes on the positively-charged side contracted, while
those on the negative side expanded, causing the whole sandwich to
bend. The result is a new kind of actuator, a device that converts
electrical energy into mechanical energy. It could have
applications in all kinds of microscopic devices.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers point out that the nanotube sheets, with their
array of countless numbers of the carbon cylinders, are akin to
muscles, which consist of millions of tiny fibers that contract
when an electrical signal reaches them from the brain. &QL;

   The emu has not been kind to American ranchers. Many sank their
savings into raising the large ostrichlike birds in the hopes that
emu meat would catch on at the dinner table. It hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   But the emu, which is native to Australia, has been kinder to
researchers. Analyzing the proportions of carbon isotopes found in
fossilized emu eggshells dating to 65,000 years ago, scientists
have gained further insight into how the climate and vegetation of
Australia have changed.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, from American and Australian institutions, made
use of the fact that different climatic conditions produce grasses
with different levels of carbon isotopes, which are incorporated
into the eggshell when the grass is eaten and metabolized.
</P>
<P>
   Using fossilized egg samples from the Lake Eyre Basin, a huge
expanse of arid land in Australia, the researchers found that from
65,000 to 45,000 years ago, warmer-weather grasses linked to summer
monsoons predominated. These grasses disappeared in the last ice
age, from 28,000 to 15,000 years ago, when cold-weather types took
over.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who described their work in Science, found that
when warmer temperatures returned, about 10,000 years ago, the
warmer grasses did not return to previous levels. They suggest that
the burning practices of early humans may have affected how far
into the continent the monsoons penetrated.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread burning in what were then semiarid areas would have
modified the vegetation found, with desert scrub replacing trees
and shrubs. The vegetation change would, in turn, have reduced the
moisture transferred to the atmosphere, thus lessening the amount
of rainfall. &QL;

   An 18th moon has been found orbiting Uranus, giving it a share,
with Saturn, of bragging rights in the category Planet With Most
Moons (mighty Jupiter, with 16, is third, followed by Neptune with
8, Mars with 2, and Earth and Pluto with 1 each).
</P>
<P>
   The new moon, which is only about 25 miles in diameter, was
actually photographed 13 years ago by the Voyager 2. Voyager had
already been credited with the discovery of 10 moons; a University
of Arizona astronomer poring over images from the mission found the
new one.
</P>
<P>
   The moon has yet to be named by the International Astronomical
Union. But most of the planet's other moons take their names from
Shakespeare (Desdemona, Oberon and Juliet being just a few). Given
how much in vogue the bard is these days, the trend seems likely to
continue.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CULLMAN, Ala. _ Before sound bites, before the press was called
the media, before the talk of broadband communications,
narrowcasting or dot-com Web portals, there was The Cullman Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Times, which sells 10,358 copies daily, has been there for
43 years. And it is still there for big events: it was the first to
tell many of its readers of the death of Diana, princess of Wales.
More recently, it let them know when $13.50 worth of gasoline was
stolen from the grocery-store pumps on Route 278. It went nuts over
the state championship girls' basketball team from Cold Springs
High School. It regularly notes who is admitted and discharged from
the Cullman Regional Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Times is one of 940 daily newspapers around the United
States with circulations of 20,000 or less. Many such newspapers
once had profit margins only a family could love. But recently,
while attention was focused on cable and Internet companies, these
far-flung atolls of the information age have been bought, sold and
swapped like the most valuable properties in a manic Monopoly game.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and 1998, more than 300 daily newspapers changed hands,
according to Owen Van Essen, whose Santa Fe, N.M. firm _ Dirks, Van
Essen &AMP; Associates _ brokers newspaper sales.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, a new generation of companies is emerging with a
different profile from earlier groups. The newcomers have borrowed
the strategy _ favored by Thomson Newspapers and others _ of buying
clusters of newspapers in one geographic area, sharing printing and
accounting facilities and offering big regional advertisers five or
six papers in a single buy.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the established publishing companies, which acquire
large and small newspapers in both rural and urban settings, the
newcomers have focused exclusively on community newspapers in
out-of-the-way regions where the skies are truly dark at night.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the new wave is a Birmingham, Ala., company called
Community Newspaper Holdings Inc., which bought The Times and 44
other newspapers late last year and, in the process, became the
biggest little newspaper company in the country (95 dailies, 125
weeklies).
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Community Newspaper Holdings is a rarity: Its sole
investor is a pension fund, which has provided all its working
capital. The Retirement Systems of Alabama, which has $22 billion
in assets, has lent the company $1.13 billion to buy newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   What would a pension fund want with small newspapers, the bottom
end of a business that is, in the polite putdown of the financial
world, mature? Small newspapers are suffering from the same
problems as their larger brethren: declining circulation and
limited growth potential for the ink-on-paper product.
</P>
<P>
   But Community Newspaper and others see gold in the steady if
unspectacular cash flow of small businesses that often operate with
little or no competition.
</P>
<P>
   There are other incentives. Think synergy at its most basic. The
director of the Alabama pension fund, David Bronner, wanted a solid
return on his investment and a media platform from which to sing
the virtues of his adopted state of Alabama. With Community
Newspaper, he gets both.
</P>
<P>
   John Morton, a newspaper-industry analyst, set up the
pension-fund manager's calculation like this: ``I can invest in the
bond market and earn five or six percent _ or I can invest in all
of these teeny cash-flow engines stuck all over the place'' for
double that return. ``Even if we have a national recession,''
Morton added, ``these are pretty durable.''
</P>
<P>
   That durability, however, depends on putting the right
combination of newspapers together. Not all regions fit Community
Newspaper's vision. Ralph J. Martin, the company's top executive,
is looking for areas with stable or growing populations, far enough
away from large television markets that there are few competitors
for local advertising dollars.
</P>
<P>
   He has developed a rough formula. For long-term economic
stability, Martin said, it helps if a newspaper is near a county
seat (lawyers tend to be newspaper readers; governments take out
legal advertising); near large educational and medical institutions
(educated work force, recession-resistant employers); near large
government operations (recession-resistant, stable employers), and
near an Interstate highway (truck traffic and tourism keep
communities healthy).
</P>
<P>
   He has selected Community Newspaper's newspapers with an eye to
minimizing the effects of an economic downturn. Martin, the
president and chief executive of Community Newspaper Holdings, said
recessions tend to hit the country at large for 18 months to two
years; in markets that fit his formula, he said, recessions have
lasted eight months or less.
</P>
<P>
   To further reduce risk, he is diversifying. Community
Newspaper's publications are based in a mixed basket of
microeconomies in places from northern New York to Kentucky to
Texas, reducing the risk that all the revenue streams would dry up
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, newspapers are not exactly a traditional investment for
a pension fund, but then again, Bronner is not exactly a
traditional pension-fund manager. His investments have also
included a New York skyscraper, a steel mill in Birmingham,
chemical plants in Mobile, a Wal-Mart distribution center in
Cullman, and his favorite, a series of golf courses around his
adopted state.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Stein, a law professor and pension specialist at the
University of Alabama, said some pension-fund members regarded
Bronner as ``something of a genius.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He does a lot of unorthodox things,'' Stein said. ``He's an
entrepreneur in an industry that is dominated by passive
investors.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bronner took over the fund in 1973, Stein said, it had $500
million in assets _ ``one dollar for every four dollars we owed.''
In 25 years, the assets have grown to $22 billion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a reason to be out on the cutting edge on some of the
things I do,'' Bronner said. ``But I think about it very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Investment decisions, he said, are made for financial reasons
first, and then are designed to meet one other unique criterion:
``Can I change the image of Alabama?''
</P>
<P>
   So when the state got a round of terrible publicity in 1990,
when the Professional Golfers' Association held its tournament at
an all-white country club, Bronner's response was to pour $120
million in retirement-system funds into a string of
state-of-the-art golf courses, open to all. The Robert Trent Jones
Golf Trail now has 324 holes to play in seven locations around the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bronner wanted to spread the word. Which is where the
newspapers come in. In addition to interest rates ranging from 9
percent to 10.4 percent, the Retirement System of Alabama requires,
as a condition of its loans to Community Newspaper, that the
company's papers provide free advertising space to the pension fund
to tout the virtues of Alabama. (He made a similar deal when he
invested in a small television company.)
</P>
<P>
   Community Newspaper's creators had different, though
complementary, agendas. Martin had worked for another large chain
and wanted to run a company of his own. One of the company's other
partners, Tom Lindley III, is a reporter turned editor turned
publisher, who is living out old daydreams of running his hometown
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the company's financial goals fit Lindley's notion of
the right balance between profit and investment in journalism. The
interest payments to the pension fund consume 9 percent to 10
percent of Community Newspaper's profit; the overall margins
expected from the newspapers, Martin said, range from 19 percent to
26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That is well below the 30 percent-plus margins of some Wall
Street favorites, like Gannett Co. But Martin said he preferred to
reinvest the difference in presses, computer technology and
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the first generation of chaining was going on,'' Martin,
a former executive at Thomson Newspapers, said, ``there was so much
opportunity from a consolidation standpoint'' that executives
focused on efficiency. ``I don't think there was an attack on
news,'' he added. ``It just fell through the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he wanted local editorial autonomy, and said he
offered only a few guidelines. Editors and publishers may not
double as local political leaders and no article may be run unless
the subject of the piece has had a fair chance to present his or
her side.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has encouraged the 53 Community Newspaper publications in
Oklahoma to create a common statehouse bureau that none could have
afforded on its own; the bureau opened four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   There is a question about whether the state of Alabama, through
its pension fund, could have a financial interest in a paper like
The Cullman Times without tainting its journalism. Will Alabama get
kid-glove treatment from Community Newspaper? ``No,'' Bronner said,
``because I know we will drag one foot forward and shoot it off
every once in a while.'' All he wants, he said, is to make clear
that ``there are some positive aspects along with the negative
aspects.''
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy did not work well at one twice-weekly newspaper,
The Floyd County Times in eastern Kentucky, which Community
Newspapers bought last year. The newspaper lost two senior
reporters after a dispute with the publisher installed last year _
Martin's brother Ed.
</P>
<P>
   As described in the current issue of American Journalism Review,
the reporters covering the corruption-ridden, economically
depressed community balked at Ed Martin's insistence that when it
comes to news, ``good and bad have the same weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Dowling Jr., editor and publisher of The Cullman Times,
said in a recent interview that a classic newspaper-company mistake
``is to think that all markets are the same and can be approached
in a cookie-cutter fashion.'' He wants the latitude to earn his
community's respect.
</P>
<P>
   Lindley, who is also editor and publisher of The Evening News in
Jeffersonville, Ala., has similar aims.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lindley was the matchmaker between the two key players
in Community Newspaper. He introduced Ralph Martin to David Bronner
in late 1996. One of Bronner's conditions, on making the initial
loan, was that Lindley would be one of the company's owners.
</P>
<P>
   Lindley had firsthand experience of what small-town newspapers
can go through. When he arrived at The Evening News (circulation
10,305) in August 1995, he said, he found a demoralized staff.
Starting salaries for reporters were $265 a week. Just a few months
before, a feature writer had been living in a homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   When Lindley asked the dean of Indiana University's journalism
school to give him the names of prospective reporters, he said, he
was told, ``We don't recommend your newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   He started to make changes. Then in mid-1997, the owners of Park
Communications Inc., who had hired him, sold their newspapers to
Media General Inc. Media General Inc. has agreed to sell its cable
television systems in Fairfax County and Fredericksburg, Va., to
Cox Communications Inc., but Media General remains an independent,
publicly owned communications company. With headquarters in
Richmond, Va., it continues to operate newspapers, broadcast
television stations, recycled newsprint production facilities, and
diversified information services.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had long thought about running his own chain, but was not
sure where to get the capital. So Lindley introduced him to
Bronner, whom he had covered as a statehouse reporter for The
Birmingham News.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Bronner hit it off, and Bronner agreed to provide the
company with working capital. In January 1997, Community Newspaper
Holdings was formed with 13 former Park Communications newspapers.
Then Martin went looking for more. Community Newspaper's most
recent big deals brought it 28 newspapers from Donrey Media Group
last September and 45 more from Hollinger Inc. in December.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Martin said, Community Newspaper is resting on
its laurels. Some future acquisitions and adjustments may be made,
but none are on the immediate horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Lindley now worries about both profit and news, but more about
news. ``If we don't do a good job in that regard, then the money
will never come,'' he said. He has hired a city editor and a
photographer, neither of which the paper had. As of now, he said,
``It's not great yet, but it's gotten better.''
</P>
<P>
   The news staff is up from nine to 11 and starting salaries are
up 35 percent, to about $360. And letters to the editor are pouring
in; at the end of last month's mayoral race, Lindley found the
angry incumbent mayor banging on his door on a Saturday night,
``scorched'' in Lindley's word, by letters he didn't like.
</P>
<P>
   At The Cullman Times, Dowling is still getting to know his new
bosses. He said he had not lost ``the local autonomy to do what we
need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be heavily involved in this community,'' he said.
``We want to be a cheerleader when people deserve it, and we want
to scold people that need scolding.''

WHAT DO WOMEN WANT? CONFESSIONS OF AN EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(kd) 
 (David M. Buss is a professor of psychology at the University of
Texas at Austin and author of ``Evolutionary Psychology: The New
Science of the Mind'' (Allyn &AMP; Bacon). 
 By DAVID M. BUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Men are slime.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how a woman graduate student summarized my conclusions
about the things men will do to have sex. Though this reaction
stings, as an evolutionary psychologist I've grown accustomed to
it.
</P>
<P>
   The theories of evolutionary psychology _ the idea that the ways
we think and act now arose through the process of natural selection
and that men, for example, evolved a strong desire for a variety of
sex partners _ disturbs so many people that the field swirls with
controversy. Goldie Hawn's publicist said she wanted to slap me.
One male colleague once called me a ``semen head.''
</P>
<P>
   According to evolutionary psychology, evolution by natural
selection has fashioned specific psychological inclinations in
response to adaptive problems repeatedly encountered over thousands
of generations. Because mating lies at the center of so much of
life, it is a particularly important area of study for evolutionary
psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologically, mating affects the distribution of wealth, and
can create patterns of inequality. Psychologically, it influences
everything from depression to social success. Mate preferences _
how we pick partners, attract them, conflict with them, keep them,
lose them, and then start all over again _ determine who is
selected and shunned, altering our species' evolution.
</P>
<P>
   And men and women differ more in mating than in any other area
of life. A man can produce a child in as little as a few minutes of
sex, but women tie up their bodies for nine months in pregnancy.
Furthermore, women have always been 100 percent certain that they
are mothers of their children. Men can never be sure. As the saying
goes, ``Mama's baby, papa's maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionary psychologists believe it would be extraordinarily
unlikely for such spectacular differences in reproductive biology,
recurring over millions of years of evolutionary history, to result
in a sexual psychology identical in men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women all want mates who are kind, understanding,
dependable, intelligent and healthy. But men and women differ in
three clusters of preferences. Women place a greater premium on a
mate's financial capacity, as well as the qualities that lead to
resources, such as ambition, industriousness and social status;
these likely aided the survival and reproduction of ancestral women
and their children. Men, in contrast, place a greater premium on
cues to fertility, such as a woman's youth and physical appearance,
as well as desiring a greater variety of sex partners.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that people's love lives are influenced by human
evolution is shocking. When I first presented my findings on mate
preferences in 37 cultures at a professional meeting, for example,
a woman approached me and suggested that I suppress the work. Her
sentiment reminded me of Lady Ashley, a contemporary of Darwin, who
said upon hearing his theory: ``Let's hope that it's not true; but
if it is true, let's hope that it doesn't become widely known.''
</P>
<P>
   But the theories of evolutionary psychology did become widely
known and a robust reaction set in. Some argued that God, not
evolution, created the human mind. Others fretted that anything
forged in the furnace of evolution would be unchangeable. And
mainstream social scientists argued that society molded the mind.
</P>
<P>
   But for me, theories that people are blank slates on which
culture writes the script could neither predict nor explain sex
differences that research tells us are universal.
</P>
<P>
   The most common concern now is that the findings will be
misused. Men, for example, might justify sexual infidelity _ ``I
couldn't help it; my evolved psychology made me do it.'' But I have
also heard men say that knowledge of evolutionary psychology helps
them remain faithful. One told me, ``When I find myself attracted
to another woman, I realize that it's just my evolved desire for
sexual variety; it doesn't mean I don't love my wife.'' He added,
``Knowing this helps me to stay faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   Another worry is that discoveries of sex differences will
justify discrimination. If evolution has made women and men
different, this reasoning goes, it might justify keeping women out
of certain jobs or at home barefoot and pregnant. But the findings
of evolutionary psychology provide no justification for these
inferences. Men and women may have different reproductive
strategies, but neither can be considered inferior or superior to
the other, any more than a bird's wings can be considered superior
or inferior to a fish's fins.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, there remains the issue of female infidelity, a
phenomenon common among species from birds to people. Perhaps it is
an adaptive sexual strategy that secures women the best of both
worlds: long-term investment from one man and higher quality genes
from another. Some ancestral mothers had affairs with men who were
stronger, healthier, more attractive or more powerful than their
husbands. Some of us are their descendants. Men fidget nervously
when I describe this theory.
</P>
<P>
   As much as evolutionary psychology can explain sexual treachery,
it also illuminates the importance of long-term love. In the
37-cultures study, I found that both women and men prize mutual
love, judging it more indispensable than any other quality. As one
Botswana woman said in the book ``Nisa,'' by Marjorie Shostak:
``When two people are first together, their hearts are on fire and
their passion is very great. After a while ... they continue to
love each other, but in a different way _ warm and dependable.''
</P>
<P>
   According to one evolutionary hypothesis, love emerged along
with the evolution of helpless offspring needing care from both
parents, with consequent commitment and pair-bonding. People
cherish a spouse because that spouse is the one person on a planet
of billions who has as much of an interest in the fate of their
children as they do.

STEROID USE BY TEEN-AGE GIRLS IS RISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)

 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether trying to reach stardom in high school sports, working
to achieve a fashionable lean-but-muscular look or suffering from a
deep psychological disorder, teen-age girls are using illegal
anabolic steroids in sharply increasing numbers, health authorities
say.
</P>
<P>
   The increased usage among girls, which some researchers
attribute in part to a kind of reverse anorexia, has caught up to
levels that began to be established by boys in the 1980s. And
steroid use, researchers say, exposes girls to the same severe
health risks, but with the added potential of destroying their
ability to bear children.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Drug Abuse says about 175,000
teen-age girls in the United States have reported taking anabolic
steroids at least once within a year of the time surveyed _ a rise
of 100 percent since 1991. The surveys, by the University of
Michigan's Institute for Social Research, the National Household
Survey of Drug Abuse and the Youth Risk and Behavior Survey System,
were done in schools or the home through anonymous self-reported
questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lloyd D. Johnston, director of the Michigan project, which
has been conducting annual youth surveys since 1975, said the
actual number of users may actually be higher than the most recent
surveys show, since people tend to underreport drug use. The rate
among teen-age boys has also continued to rise, to the current
estimated level of 325,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other indications, including the results of a small study in
Oregon, are that steroid use among both girls and boys is
increasing unabated. The three national surveys were conducted
before Mark McGwire set baseball's single-season home run record
last year, acknowledging that he used androstenedione, a precursor
of testosterone, to help him build muscle. Whether androstenedione,
which is allowed in professional baseball but banned in other
sports, does in fact build muscles remains a matter of medical
dispute, though the perception of many athletes, both adult and
adolescent, is that it does. In any case, sports medicine doctors
generally agree that its potential for inducing serious side
effects is similar to that of anabolic steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get calls every day from the coaches and parents of girls as
well as boys,'' said Dr. Linn Goldberg, a physician at Oregon
Health Sciences University in Portland and a United States Olympic
Committee drug testing official. ``Some are concerned and some want
to know whether their children should use androstenedione.''
</P>
<P>
   His answer is an unequivocal no, either to use of steroids or
androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   Anabolic steroids are synthetic substitutes for testosterone,
the hormone that directs the body to produce or add male
characteristics like increased muscle mass, facial hair and a deep
voice. The hormone exists in females as well, though in much
smaller amounts. Liver cancer, heart disease and uncontrollable
aggressiveness are among other serious side effects that can occur
in both males and females of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   The health damages might not appear for years or decades after
the steroids are taken, said Dr. Gary I. Wadler, a professor of
clinical medicine at New York University School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles E. Yesalis, a steroid authority at Pennsylvania
State University, was among the first to analyze the 1997
female-adolescent data in December of that year in the Archives of
Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine and to sound the alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Most prevention programs, he said recently, have not been
effective. ``I am asked to speak in schools and other
institutions,'' Yesalis said, ``but you don't get anywhere with
speeches or charts or film clips or posters. We know one-shot
messages don't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said teen-age boys and girls generally obtain illegal
steroids from people who congregate at commercial gyms. ``That's
where most people say they obtain them,'' Goldberg said. ``Someone,
in this part of the country, will go down to Mexico, where it is
easy to get the stuff, and bring it back, either in pill form or
injectables.'' And then one young person will buy some and
distribute them to his or her schoolmates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new interest among teen-age girls, these and other health
experts say, reflect a gradual change in attitude, and fashion, or
teen-age peer pressure, away from a preoccupation with thinness.
Some teen-age girls now desire to look more healthy and somewhat
more muscular, but this has led some girls toward an unhealthy
compulsion to be ever fitter with larger muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone from the overweight beauty of the Rubens women, to
the thin rail of the Twiggy types and now back to something in
between, the lean but muscular type,'' Wadler said. ``These are
people who are virtually addicted to the mirror. But they will
never be satisfied with what they see, and this is now happening to
teen-age girls who want bigger muscles no matter how much bigger
their muscles have become.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harrison G. Pope Jr., chief of the Biological Psychiatry
Laboratory of Harvard Medical School's McLean Hospital, and
colleagues referred to a similar disorder in male weight lifters as
``reverse anorexia'' after it was observed in 1993. The researchers
recently updated the work with a study of 32 women bodybuilders, 17
of whom showed signs of an emotional disorder called body
dysmorphism, which is the excessive preoccupation with a trait or
traits of the body viewed as ugly or defective whether they are or
not.
</P>
<P>
   Several women in the study were so addicted to working out that
they cut off job opportunities and close personal relationships.
But Pope said too little research had been done on this emerging
obsession among teen-age girls to draw specific conclusions about
its complex causes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The case of one of the worst known adverse reactions to steroid
use, reported by Goldberg, is that of a 19-year-old West Coast
woman who was preparing to enter her first bodybuilding contest,
lifting weights and eating a high-protein diet. She then switched
to a drastically reduced intake of food and water. Obsessed with
her goal, she began taking anabolic steroids and a diuretic. The
steroid would add muscle and the diuretic would drain the body of
fluid and make the muscle stand out more.
</P>
<P>
   She won the contest, but it will probably be her last. After she
collected her trophy, she resumed drinking water and eating
normally, and her weight shot up by 25 pounds in three days.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that the diuretic had masked the actual amount of
muscle she had built up, said Goldberg, who was one of a group of
health experts who reviewed the case. When she drank more fluids,
he said, her muscles pushed out to the full over-developed size and
crushed blood vessels in her legs. Called compartment syndrome, the
condition put her limbs, if not her life, in danger, and surgeons
had to cut open both legs to protect her vascular system and remove
significant amounts of the new muscle tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg and Dr. Diane L. Elliot hope to educate girls about the
dangers of steroid use as they have done with boys. They recently
completed a program, called Atlas, that is supported by the
National Institute on Drug Abuse and is aimed at reducing steroid
use among young male athletes. A main element of the program,
involving 3,200 male athletes at 31 high schools in Oregon and
Washington, was to teach the students to educate one another on the
problems. The number of male students that reported having used
steroids within a year was cut by 50 percent. Under another
National Institute of Drug Abuse grant, they are developing a
similar program for girls.
</P>
<P>
   Yesalis said the Goldberg-Elliot program was the only one he
knew of that worked. ``Unless young people are taught to know where
and how to draw the line, to know that it's not right to try to win
at all costs, they're not going to listen when you tell them
steroids put their lives at risk for the glory of winning,'' he
said.

PERSONAL HEALTH: GUIDE FOR PARENTS IN HUNT FOR A SAFE SUMMER CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why does a tragedy always seem necessary to alert people to
consider safety issues that should be a matter of course? Such a
tragedy occurred last summer when 10-year-old Jeremy Scheinfeld of
New Rochelle, N.Y., drowned during an ill-conceived activity at an
upstate sleep-away camp.
</P>
<P>
   The incident took place during a game off camp grounds that
required him to jump into swirling water wearing hiking clothes and
shoes. Though he could swim, he became enmeshed in underwater
branches and could not free himself. It took 18 hours to locate his
body.
</P>
<P>
   The death has led Jeremy's parents, Jodi and Robert Scheinfeld,
to start a campaign to improve camp safety and to get parents to
look more carefully into the people to whom they entrust their
children during the summer and the camp conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Parents checking out summer camps for their children are likely
to delve into the camp's reputation, the kinds of activities
offered, the mix of children who attend, the attitudes of camp
personnel and the general atmosphere of the camp. But do they know
if the counselors are well trained, or whether fire extinguishers
are readily available in the bunks, or how well the camp is able to
deal with medical emergencies?
</P>
<P>
   Though most people would prefer not to think that a stay at camp
could involve a life-threatening illness or injury, the
Scheinfelds' experience is good reason to go to great lengths to
assure that children in camp will not be the victims of poor
judgment and avoidable injury and will return home healthy and
intact.
</P>
<P>
   The Scheinfelds have established a Web site outlining safety
guidelines for parents to consider when shopping for a camp. It is:
www.campsafetyguide.com
</P>
<P>
   It is not that camps lack safety requirements. The American
Camping Association, which accredits camps, lists 300 health and
safety standards, but only about 25 mandatory standards and an 80
percent score on the rest must be met to be accredited.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Hammond, the group's director of standards, says 2,300 to
2,400 camps are accredited, representing only one-quarter to
one-third of camps in this country.
</P>
<P>
   To obtain an operating permit, camps must meet state safety
standards, but there are no federal requirements. (In New York,
inspections are done by a county health officer.) If serious
injuries or deaths occur at a camp, the state health department is
supposed to be notified. But parents who want to know whether a
particular camp has had such problems do not have easy access to
state records.
</P>
<P>
   And so parents seeking information about a camp need to question
the director or other responsible person about things like
counselor training and credentials, safety of buildings,
precautions taken around water and access to emergency care.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the parents' job to be sure their children are
physically suited for the activities likely to be encountered at
the camp. Too often, the precamp medical examination is treated as
a bothersome formality.
</P>
<P>
   Why, many parents wonder, do perfectly healthy children have to
be checked out before engaging in camp activities that they are
likely to take part in at other times of the year as well?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the precamp physical is an opportunity to have a
child's health thoroughly assessed. For another, children at camp
may push themselves or be goaded to go beyond their bodily limits
when engaging in physically demanding group activities.
</P>
<P>
   Camp personnel should always be alerted to the recent or current
health problems of children in their charge. These might include
recent illnesses, injuries or operations; allergies and especially
food allergies, which can be life-threatening, chronic health
problems like asthma or diabetes and any physical limitations or
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Parents must also be sure to give permission to camp personnel
to provide emergency medical care, if needed, if the parents cannot
immediately be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can consult the camping association's Web site, which
has a section that includes suggested questions to ask camp
directors, guidance on choosing a camp and a list of accredited
camps. The site is: www.acacamps.org
</P>
<P>
   Be sure the camp is accredited, but do not assume a camp is safe
even if it is accredited or if a parent or child previously
attended it or worked there. Ask to see the camp's written safety
plan, which must be filed with the state or county health
department and which describes staff qualifications and training,
camper supervision, safety requirements for specific activities and
fire safety and medical requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Ask how the staff is screened and trained. Are prospective
counselors checked for driving and criminal records and previous
employment history? Are their swimming skills tested? Do counselors
undergo a precamp training program (usually for six days) that
includes safety instruction and must they pass a test? Are all
counselors at least 18, and is the median age of counselors 21 or
more, as recommended by the camping association? What is the
camper-to-staff ratio? The younger the children, the fewer campers
should be in each counselor's charge.
</P>
<P>
   What percentage of counselors are trained and certified in CPR
or first aid? What arrangement does the camp have for medical care,
both on site and off?
</P>
<P>
   How are water-related activities supervised? Does the aquatic
director have at least three seasons of previous waterfront
experience, as required by New York State? Does the camp have a
water safety or progressive swimming instructor to assess the
swimming ability of each camper? How many lifeguards are there and
are they specifically trained for the types of swimming areas at
the camp?
</P>
<P>
   Is there a protocol for all off-site excursions? Will counselors
have a way of communicating for help if needed? Does a qualified
scout check out the path or activity before the children start out
(for example, a hiking trail may become treacherous after a rain)?
Must parents sign permission forms for these activities? Is proper
safety equipment used? Are children transported in safe vehicles
that have seat belts, and are they required to buckle up?
</P>
<P>
   Does the camp allow children to go into off-site bodies of
water? If so, has a government permit been issued that insures the
availability of lifesaving and safety equipment and qualified
lifeguards? Children should always wear bathing attire, not street
clothes, when entering water and life jackets when in boats.
</P>
<P>
   Does the camp maintain strict discipline for the staff,
including zero tolerance for drug and alcohol abuse and a staff
curfew? Has it fired counselors and for what reasons? Have there
been deaths or serious injuries, what happened and what has the
camp done to prevent a recurrence?
</P>
<P>
   If your inquiries are met with hostile responses, try another
camp.  &QL;

HYPOTHERMIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. If a body temperature of 107 degrees Fahrenheit is nearly
always fatal, what low body temperature is generally fatal?
</P>
<P>
   A. Medical literature contains few if any cases in which people
have recovered after their inner, or core, temperatures dropped
below 55 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``The Merck Manual of Medical Information'' says that
people with hypothermia should not be considered dead until they
have been warmed and still have no signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   Core body temperature is usually measured by electronic sensors
inserted into the digestive tract, often by way of the mouth or
rectum. It cannot be measured with an ordinary oral thermometer.
Hypothermia is considered to exist whenever the core temperature is
below 95 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Hypothermia occurs when the body loses heat faster than it can
burn fuel to replace it. How severe a person's reactions to low
temperatures will be depends on age and overall physical condition,
with the very old and the very young the most vulnerable; about 80
percent of hypothermia deaths occur in those older than 65.
</P>
<P>
   Age increases the risk for several reasons. The ability to
generate body heat declines because the heart rate is slower, blood
vessels do not contract as well, and the elderly often lose muscle
tone (which generates heat) and body fat (which conserves heat and
supplies body fuel).
</P>
<P>
   Exposed skin, cold air, cold water, cold wet clothing and
sitting on a cold surface that conducts heat away from the body all
greatly increase the rate of heat loss. Dehydration also adds to
the risks.
</P>
<P>
   The rates of chemical activity in the body are slowed by very
low temperatures. Eventually, the heartbeat and breathing may stop,
but even a very slow heartbeat and rate of respiration may maintain
vital body functions.
</P>
<P>
   Immediate treatment for hypothermia victims involves stopping
further loss of heat by wrapping the person in warm dry blankets.
Gentle handling is essential because jolts can cause fatally
irregular heart rhythms.

ATHLETES TEST STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By LIZ NEPORENT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many adults, the mention of the president's Physical Fitness
Test conjures up images of sprinting between two chalkboard erasers
and doing sit ups to exhaustion. For those with fond memories of
this grade school gym class standard there is now a grown up
version of it called Strend, a challenging six-event contest that
is attracting more and more competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Strend is an acronym derived from the first three letters of
``strength'' and ``endurance.'' Each Strend competition includes
five upper-body strength events _ bench presses, pull-ups, military
presses, chin-ups and bar dips followed by a three-mile run. The
first Strend contest in 1992 was little more than a group workout.
There are now four to six events a year in several U.S. cities and
throughout Germany. A world championship features 50 competitors
and offers prize money for the top three men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors are allotted three minutes per strength event to do
as many repetitions as possible and then move on to the run. To
negate size and body-weight advantage, the weight that participants
use for the lifting exercises is based on a percentage of
individual body weight, which is officially measured a few hours
before the start of the competition. For example, Jennifer
Thompson-Tuzon, third-place finisher in the elite division at the
world Strend championship in October, was required to bench press
80 percent of her total body weight (120 pounds) as many times as
she could in the three minutes. ``I'd hoped I could do that much,''
said Ms. Thompson-Tuzon. She needed to complete a minimum of four
repetitions to prevent disqualification. She exceeded this by five
repetitions.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of a Strend competition is the athlete with the
highest Strend factor, a number calculated by adding the total
number of repetitions performed in the strength events and dividing
them by the three-mile run time. At the championship, Sonki Hong of
Walnut Creek, Calif., performed a total of 130 strength
repetitions, including 36 bar dips, and ran his three miles in
17:27, (5 minutes and 45 seconds per mile) for a world record
Strend factor of 7.449. At the same event, Peedi-Jean Saldania of
Honolulu established a new women's elite Strend factor record of
3.566. Ms. Saldania completed 78 strength exercise repetitions and
finished her run in 21:52 (7 minutes and 10 seconds per mile.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The philosophy of Strend is to maintain a balance between
muscular strength and aerobic endurance,'' said Carol Jaxon,
president of Strend Fitness Challenge, ``and unlike many other
sports, Strend makes an attempt to level the playing field.'' She
points out that the 29-year-old Hong weighs just 135 pounds and
that many of the other athletes outweigh him by more than 30
pounds. Also , factors like the hand placement on the pull-up bar
and the barbell are carefully controlled to take arm length into
account.
</P>
<P>
   The Strend Fitness Challenge is the brainchild of Edward
Bugarin, Ms. Jaxon's husband and a retired Army officer who was
once part of Delta Force, the elite anti-terrorist unit. The idea
for the competitions evolved from the fitness routine Bugarin used
to keep in shape for military operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to give those who practice both strength and
cardiovascular disciplines a way to compete against other like
athletes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The next Strend competition will be Saturday at Miramar Marine
Corps Air Station in San Diego, and the fourth Strend world
championship is scheduled for Oct. 16 in Honolulu. Strend is on the
Web at www.strend.com.  &QL;

GANGING UP ON BLOOD CLOTS WITH A NEW DRUG COCKTAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Mass., Wash., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adding a ``super aspirin'' to a standard clot-dissolving drug is
a more effective treatment for heart attacks than either drug
alone, according to an international study being published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs are alteplase, or Activase, and abciximab, or Reopro.
Each drug is marketed in this country but for separate uses. The
combination promises to spare many patients from angioplasty, a
procedure to widen blocked coronary arteries, or even from coronary
bypass surgery, experts said, citing the report in Circulation, a
journal published by the American Heart Association in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Heart attacks are the leading cause of death in the United
States and in other developed countries. Most heart attacks result
from blood clots that form after deposits of fat break open in the
lining of coronary arteries that nourish the heart, stopping blood
flow, destroying heart muscle and weakening the heart's ability to
pump blood. This, in turn, increases the risk of dangerous abnormal
heart rhythms and other complications.
</P>
<P>
   Alteplase, a standard drug often called TPA, can dissolve the
clots if given within a few hours after chest pain and other
symptoms of a heart attack begin. But sometimes, clots recur after
such drug therapy, largely from the clumping of blood cells known
as platelets.
</P>
<P>
   Abciximab prevents platelet clumping, and because it is more
potent than aspirin in doing so, abciximab is often called a
super-aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   The study is ``an important conceptual breakthrough'' in heart
attack therapy because the drugs attack clots in different ways,
said the lead author of the study, Dr. Elliott M. Antman of the
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Abciximab weakens the structure of the clot by breaking up
platelet clumps and allows alteplase to penetrate more deeply into
the clot.
</P>
<P>
   Alteplase is a member of a class of drugs approved for treating
heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Abciximab, which is generally used in angioplasty procedures and
in cases of a chest pain condition known as unstable angina, does
not have broad approval for use against heart attacks. However,
doctors often use licensed drugs for unapproved uses, and many are
now expected to use the new combination for heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial in the same issue of the journal, Dr. J. Ward
Kennedy and Dr. Michael L. Stadius, both of the University of
Washington in Seattle, called the study ``a major contribution'' to
the management of heart attacks. While cautioning that additional
studies will be required, the Seattle cardiologists said that this
and newer combinations of drugs ``will likely prove to be
equivalent or superior to'' angioplasty and bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Antman said his team got the idea for the combination therapy
three years ago after it ``pieced together'' clues to its potential
use from animal experiments and from analyzing some clinical trials
in which a small number of patients happened to receive both drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Antman credited experiments conducted by Dr. Barry S. Coller,
then of the State University of New York at Stony Brook and now of
Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan, as pivotal in starting his
team's study, which was conducted from March 1997 through July 1998
in the United States, Belgium, Canada, England, France, Germany and
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The study compared the ability of different amounts of the two
drugs, singly or in combination, to dissolve blood clots and
improve blood flow at 60 minutes and 90 minutes after they were
injected. A major concern was that a smaller-than-standard dose of
alteplase would be ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   But a combination of half the standard dose of alteplase and a
standard amount of abciximab improved blood flow in 72 percent of
the heart attack patients at 60 minutes and in 77 percent at 90
minutes. Alteplase alone eased blood flow in 43 percent of the
patients at 60 minutes and 62 percent at 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Both drugs are expensive. Alteplase costs about $2,000 for a
standard dose. Abciximab costs about $1,000. Although the immediate
savings balance out, there could be substantial longer-term savings
if the therapy reduces the need for angioplasty and bypass surgery,
Antman said.
</P>
<P>
   If widely adopted, the combination drug therapy would be only
part of the long-range treatment to prevent heart attacks. Patients
would also receive a drug to lower cholesterol in the blood and in
the fatty deposits in the arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to test combinations of other drugs that are
now marketed or in development, Antman said.  &QL;

IN TIME FOR THE BEACH, NEW SUNSCREEN RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(lh) 
 By ALISHA BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration recently issued new regulations
for labeling, testing and manufacturing sun protection products.
The rules do away with terms like ``sun block,'' ``waterproof'' and
``all-day protection.'' All over-the-counter sun protection
products will be called ``sunscreen.'' Those that resist water will
be classified either as ``water resistant'' or ``very water
resistant'' on product packaging.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency also approved a list of active ingredients
for over-the-counter sunscreens. In order to be considered
``active,'' ingredients have to ``absorb, reflect or scatter
radiation in the UV range at wavelengths of 290 to 400
nanometers.'' UVB rays, which induce sunburn and skin cancer, fall
into the 290 to 320 nanometer range, while UVA rays, which affect
aging and cause skin cancer, range from 320 to 400. Some of the
sunscreen-approved ingredients that the agency listed were zinc
oxide, titanium dioxide, dioxybenzone and avobenzone. There were 18
in all.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also announced a new rating system in which sunscreen
products would be ranked as ``minimum,'' ``moderate'' or ``high.''
High includes any products with an SPF, or sun protection factor,
of 30 or greater, moderate is 12 to 29 and minimum is 2 to 11. SPF
ratings are calculated by comparing the amount of time needed to
produce a sunburn on protected skin to the amount of time needed
for unprotected skin to burn. In other words, people wearing
sunscreen rated SPF 15, would take 15 times longer to burn &UR;  &LR; than
they would if they were not wearing sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Dermatology takes issue with some
aspects of the new guidelines. Dr. Darrell S. Rigel, president of
the academy, believes it is misleading to lump all products with
SPF ratings of 30 or greater into one category. In the past,
sunscreen products have been labeled as high as 60 in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent studies have indicated that people tend to underapply
sunscreen and only get 20 to 50 percent of the rated SPF,'' Rigel
said. ``If you're using a 30 the way studies have shown the average
person uses it, you're only getting a 6 to 15, and that may not be
sufficient. Besides, if you cap what manufacturers can claim is the
highest SPF, there will be no incentive to make a better
sunscreen.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency counters that there are not adequate test measures to
gauge the safety and effectiveness of products with SPF's of more
than 30.
</P>
<P>
   This year, more than one million new cases of skin cancer will
be diagnosed, and the most serious form, malignant melanoma, will
claim 9,200 lives, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the effects of when people don't protect themselves from
the sun like they should,'' Rigel said. ``It is frustrating because
we know that if they protect themselves from the sun their chance
of getting skin cancer drops dramatically.''

NOTION OF DETERIORATION WITH EACH PASSING YEAR IS A MYTH, STUDY
FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (The Science Times) 
(jt) 
 By PHILIP J. HILTS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until recently, very few people lived to be more than 100. But
with the number of centenarians rocketing upward, statisticians and
scientists have begun studying them _ and challenging some of the
conventional wisdom about the very old.
</P>
<P>
   These are not necessarily people at the end of the line,
deteriorating into extreme age. Rather, many show patterns of
health that are as surprising as they are mysterious. For example,
the rate at which people die rises steadily from middle age up
through the 80s. But then, death rates decline. After age 110, the
death rate drops back to that for people in their 80s.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who make it past 90 or 95 are in robust health; as
a group, they are healthier than people 10 to 15 years younger. It
is as if those strong enough to make it to 95 are strong enough to
run a while longer. A substantial number of them stay healthy and
in command of their faculties until a short time before death.
</P>
<P>
   Those who reach 100 usually have had no dementia or serious
cognitive problems up through their mid-90s, said Dr. Margery H.
Silver, a leader of a Harvard University study of centenarians.
Contrary to previous studies, which suggested that nearly 100
percent of those reaching 100 should suffer dementia, the study
shows that after 100, up to one-quarter of the centenarians still
have no dementia. About 50 percent have mild to moderate dementia,
and an additional quarter have very severe dementia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways centenarians are healthier than people 20 to 30
years their junior,'' Dr. Silver and her colleague, Dr. Thomas
Perls, wrote in ``Living to 100,'' recently published by Basic
Books. ``Rather than accumulating damage, they were shedding it
like water from a duck's back.'' Perls and Dr. Silver are leading
the New England Centenarian Study at Beth Israel-Deaconness
Hospital and Harvard University Medical School, both in Boston.
</P>

   One of a number of studies of the extremely old, it is the only
so-called population-based study of people 100 and older. That
means it followed a natural population (in this case, 460,000
people in six towns in Massachusetts) and studied every person who
reached 100, checking factors like their conditions, incomes and
social status. Since the study began in 1994, a number of
interesting facts have emerged, including these:
</P>
<P>
   _Among the 169 centenarians, who have been extensively studied,
only three have had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   _A disproportionate number are women who never married.
</P>
<P>
   _No pattern of diet and exercise appears among the centenarians;
some are vegetarians, some eat lots of red meat; some are athletes
and some do nothing strenuous.
</P>
<P>
   _The only personality trait the subjects share is the ability to
manage stress effectively. As a group, they have experienced as
much stress as others, but they seem to have bounced back readily
from life's crises.
</P>
<P>
   _About 80 percent of those over 100 are women. But the
relatively few men in the group are far healthier than the women _
exactly opposite the situation at age 85. About 80 percent of the
men over 100 are healthy and mentally alert, while 80 percent of
the women have at least some dementia.
</P>
<P>
   _Among the women who are mothers, the ones who had children
after age 40 are disproportionately represented.
</P>
<P>
   _Medical expenses, which peak for those 60 to 69, drop for those
85 to 105. They get cheaper for society as they age.

 UNDATED: they age.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What may be the most fundamental finding is not in the details,
but in the larger picture: some people live to extreme old age in
good health.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 50,000 centenarians in the United States now, up
from almost none at the turn of the century. Like the rest of
society, they have benefited from two great waves that extended
life expectancy: improved public sanitation, which increased
average life expectancy by 20 years, and the advent of antibiotics
and other drugs, which added another 10.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, demographers began to calculate the combined
effects of the growing population and the additional life span,
producing a gloomy ``standard model'' of aging that has prevailed
for 20 years. In this view, said Dr. Richard Suzman of the National
Institute on Aging, society might ``save people from dying, but
would not be able to cure them of chronic, disease.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus,'' Suzman said, ``there would be an accumulation, a
pandemic of people in worse and worse shape. This was a very
strongly held paradigm in gerontology.''
</P>
<P>
   The Centenarian Study challenges this view. The elderly are not
only living longer and are healthier, but there is something of a
mystery about why.
</P>
<P>
   James W. Vaupel, a demographer at the Max Planck Institute in
Rostock, Germany, who is involved in a Danish centenarian study,
noted last year in the journal Science that it had long been
erroneously assumed that there was a biological limit to longevity,
and that more and more people in a group died each year as they
approached it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a hypothetical group of 100 people, a certain
number die each year. That number increases to about 5 each year at
around age 65, 8 each year at 75 and 11 each year at 85. How is it
possible, then, that at age 90 the number remains 11 and at 100 it
drops back to 8? The studies show just that: The death rate levels
off in the 90s, and even appears to decrease after age 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decline in old-age mortality is perplexing,'' Vaupel said.
``What biological charter permits us to live long post-reproductive
lives?
</P>
<P>
   Scientists who study population figures were skeptical when
these numbers were first suggested. They suspected the sampling of
the very old was skewed. So Vaupel and colleagues ran tests to
check the idea. They figured that if the drop in mortality rate was
a real biological phenomenon, it should also appear among other
species.
</P>
<P>
   He started with fruit flies _ 2,706,967 of them to be exact. He
also followed the lives of 27,542 wasps, and about 650,000
parasitic worms. The pattern was the same across the species. Death
rates rose, peaked late in life, then dropped. Thus, while most
fruit flies die at age 30 days, a few hardy ones fly on. Of the 2.7
million he studied, 44 females and 18 males lived 100 days.
</P>
<P>
   To check one more possibility, Vaupel studied another complex
creature: the automobile. A car has died, he decided, if it is not
reregistered. He studied Chevrolets and Toyotas from the 1970 and
1980 model years. The pattern was there again: the ``death'' rate
peaked at about 10 years, then began to drop. The effect was not as
dramatic as in fruit flies, but it was there.
</P>
<P>
   The question is why? It may be partly a phenomenon of large,
complex systems of all kinds _ a few of the best made and best
treated can last much longer. With humans, that may mean
exceptional genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably all have the genes to get us to age 85, if we take
care of ourselves,'' said Perls. ``But it may be that some of us
have supergenes, genes that protect us from cancers or Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth Rockwood, a gerontologist at Dalhousie University in
Halifax, Nova Scotia, said the important factor, genetic or
otherwise, appeared to show itself early. Aging may be slowed even
at young ages, for example, with very late menopause, which occurs
among many of the women who become centenarians, suggesting they
are already aging more slowly by 50.
</P>
<P>
   Perls and Dr. Silver say they have found crucial evidence that
genes are a large part of living past 100 _ that extreme old age
runs in families. They have found several families with 10 or more
centenarians and many others over 90. Now they hope to find genes
that keep them healthy, perhaps by helping to ward off disease.
``Then maybe we can find some medications that will inhibit
negative gene products, or potentiate the positive ones,'' Dr.
Perls said.
</P>
<P>
   An example of what they hope to find is a human counterpart of
the fruit-fly gene HSP70. These proteins shield other cellular
substances from damage, and so as flies age, the more of this
protein they make, the longer they live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we know that a substantial number of people can
remain robust and healthy through their 90s, at least, that should
change our attitude about old age,'' Perls said. ``It is no longer
a curse, but an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the centenarians studied in New England group was Anna
Morgan of Rehoboth, Mass. She remained so healthy in old age that
on her 100th birthday, she was not at home but rather was
testifying on health care before a committee of the state
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Just before she died at 101, she told researchers she had to
make all her own funeral arrangements before anything happened to
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my children to be burdened with all this,'' she
said. ``They're old, you know.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of potent thunderstorms will develop across the middle
Mississippi, Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys in response to the
lifting of humid air from the Gulf of Mexico by a jet stream
disturbance approaching from the central Plains. Some of the storms
will produce heavy rain. Severe weather is also possible in a few
of the storms, with isolated spots of large hail and damaging
winds. Burly, hit-or-miss thunderstorms will extend southwest into
portions of eastern Oklahoma, Arkansas and northeast Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Hazy humid conditions with scattered showers and thunderstorms
will extend from the central Gulf Coast to the western spine of the
southern and central Appalachians as a Bermuda high-pressure system
continues to pump tropical air into the East. Northbound tropical
air will also collide with a cool front across the eastern and
southeast Great Lakes region, setting the stage for hit-or-miss
thunderstorms with the potential for heavy rains across northern
Indiana, southern Michigan, extreme western New York and the St.
Lawrence River Valley in Quebec, Canada, the latter being at
greatest risk.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated, heavy thunderstorms associated with the leading edge
of the sea breeze will erupt across southern Florida. With moist
winds from the east importing juicy tropical air, rainfalls of 2
inches or more are possible in spots.
</P>
<P>
   Widely separated showers and thunderstorms will develop across
northern Washington and southern British Columbia as a pocket of
cold air 18,000 feet aloft destabilizes the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: June Gloom
</P>
<P>
   The high at San Francisco on Saturday was 54 degrees, tying the
city's record for the lowest maximum temperature for the date. The
daytime chill was caused by low clouds and drizzle associated with
a deep, cool and moist layer of marine air, which, on Saturday
spanned from the ground to 3,000 feet aloft. A marine layer gets
its name from the fact that coast-bound air acquires moisture and
the approximate temperature of underlying cool waters. With
cooler-than-average Pacific waters, the infamous ``June gloom'' of
recurrent morning fog and low clouds at the coast now appears to be
a safe bet.

DATA SHOW GOOD HEALTH MAY BE SOCIALLY CORRECT

<P>
   Doctors usually evaluate patients' vulnerability to serious
disease by inquiring about risk factors like cigarette smoking,
obesity, hypertension and high cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   But they might be better off asking how much money those
patients make, how many years they spent in school and where they
stand relative to others in their offices and communities.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have known for decades that poverty translates into
higher rates of illness and mortality. But an explosion of research
is demonstrating that social class _ as measured not just by income
but also by education and other markers of relative status _ is one
of the most powerful predictors of health, more powerful than
genetics, exposure to carcinogens, even smoking.
</P>
<P>
   What matters is not simply whether a person is rich or poor,
college educated or not. Rather, risk for a wide variety of
illnesses, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arthritis,
infant mortality, many infectious diseases and some types of
cancer, varies with relative wealth or poverty: the higher the rung
on the socioeconomic ladder, the lower the risk. And this
relationship holds even at the upper reaches of society, where it
might seem that an abundance of resources would even things out.
</P>
<P>
   Social class is an uncomfortable subject for many Americans. ``I
think there has been a resistance to thinking about social
stratification in our society,'' said Dr. Nancy Adler, professor of
medical psychology at the University of California at San Francisco
and director of the John T. and Catherine D. MacArthur Foundation
Research Network on Socioeconomic Status and Health. Instead,
researchers traditionally have focused on health differences
between rich and poor, or blacks and whites (unaware, in many
cases, that race was serving as a proxy for socioeconomic status,
since blacks are overrepresented in lower income brackets).
</P>
<P>
   But the notion that a mid-level executive with a three-bedroom,
split-level home in Scarsdale might somehow be more vulnerable to
illness than his boss in the five-bedroom colonial a few blocks
away seems to have finally captured scientists' attention.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, 193 papers addressing aspects of
socioeconomic status and health have appeared in scientific
journals _ twice the number in the previous five-year period. The
National Institutes of Health last year declared research on
disparities in health related to social class or minority status
one of its highest priorities, said Dr. Norman Anderson, associate
director of the NIH. And a recent conference in Bethesda, Md., on
the topic, sponsored by the New York Academy of Sciences and the
MacArthur Foundation network, drew more than 250 participants from
a wide variety of disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   What first compelled researchers interest was a now-classic
study, begun in the late 1960s, of men in the British civil
service. The Whitehall study, directed by Dr. Michael Marmot,
director of the International Center for Health and Society at
University College London, tracked mortality rates over 10 years
for 17,530 male civil service employees.
</P>
<P>
   When the data were analyzed, the researchers were astonished to
discover that mortality rates varied continuously and precisely
with the men's civil service grade: the higher the classification,
the lower the rates of death, regardless of cause.
</P>
<P>
   This finding was as perplexing as it was intriguing. The men all
had jobs, and equal access to health care under Britain's national
health system. But mortality rates for men in the lowest civil
service classification, the researchers found, were three times
higher than those for men in the highest grade. And a 25-year
follow-up of the Whitehall subjects, some results of which were
published in 1996, found the social class gradient persisted well
past retirement, even among men into their late 80s.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent studies demonstrated a similar relationship between
socioeconomic status and mortality in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   What could account for such startling findings? One plausible
explanation was that lower-ranked men might engage in more risky
behaviors, like smoking. But the same health disparity from pay
grade to pay grade that was evident in smokers held for nonsmokers,
too. And all coronary risk factors combined, the researchers found,
accounted for only a third of the differences between grades.
</P>
<P>
   Stress, or other aspects of psychological life that can have an
impact on a person's vulnerability to disease, the Whitehall group
reasoned, might also play a role in the results. Prolonged exposure
to stress, researchers have found, can lead to abnormalities in
immune function and glucose metabolism, and destroy brain cells
involved in memory. And studies show that the lower one's social
status, the more stressed people feel, and the more stressful
events they encounter in their lives.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sheldon Cohen, professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh, has demonstrated a link between social
status and vulnerability to infectious disease in male macaque
monkeys. In a study carried out in conjunction with primate
researchers at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Cohen
found that males at the lower end of the dominance hierarchy were
more susceptible to a cold virus than dominant males.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and his colleagues at Carnegie Mellon then replicated
those findings in humans. Subjects in the study were asked to rate
their relative standing in their community on a social status
ladder, then were exposed to mild respiratory virus. People who
ranked themselves low on the ladder were more likely to become
infected with the virus than those who ranked themselves higher up
on the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, the researchers found that people who had been
unemployed for one month or more under highly stressful conditions
were 3.8 times more susceptible to a virus than people who were not
experiencing a significant stressful situation.
</P>
<P>
   At least in primates, the interaction of stress with social
class and illness, however, depends both on the nature of the
stress and the context in which it occurs, as demonstrated in a
series of studies by Dr. Jay R. Kaplan, a professor of pathology
and anthropology at Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   In a crowded situation where resources are scarce, for example,
male monkeys at the lowest end of the dominance hierarchy, who must
scramble hardest to survive, are likely to feel the most stress.
And in studies of primates in the wild, researchers find that
subordinate animals show higher levels of stress hormones.
</P>
<P>
   But when Kaplan and his colleagues fed male monkeys a ``luxury''
diet, high in fat and cholesterol, and moved them each month for
two years into a new group of strange males, it was the dominant
animals, forced to reassert their position continually, who
suffered the most stress. Under such conditions, Kaplan finds,
dominant males show a hypervigilant response, and have higher rates
of coronary artery disease than subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   For humans and primates, a sense of control over life events is
intimately related to stress. And control seems to have been one
factor at work in the Whitehall study.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Marmot and his colleagues launched Whitehall II, a
second large-scale study, which included civil servants of both
sexes and which collected more detailed information on the
participants.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the study, employees were asked to rate the amount of
control they felt over their jobs. Managers also rated the amount
of control employees had. Job control, the researchers found,
varied inversely with employment grade: the higher the grade, the
more control. And the less control employees had, as defined either
by their own or managers' ratings, the higher the employees' risk
of developing coronary disease. Job control, in fact, accounted for
about half the gradient in deaths from pay grade to pay grade.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, people's ability to withstand stress, and the
ways in which they interpret and respond to life events, are also
shaped by early life, the product of what one social scientist, Dr.
Clyde Hertzman of the University of British Columbia, calls ``the
long arm of childhood.'' Genetics play a role, as does nutrition.
(In the Whitehall study, height _ which varies with social class _
was used as a rough indicator of childhood influences on
development, and accounted for a small portion of the association
between mortality and employment grade.) And scientists have found
that early life experiences _ abuse and neglect, for example _ can
alter brain development and influence responses to stressful
events.
</P>
<P>
   Any discussion of socioeconomic status in the United States of
necessity involves a discussion of race, since the two are entwined
in complex, sometimes inextricable, ways. Proportionally, far more
African-Americans live in poverty than whites: 28.4 percent of
blacks fell below the poverty line in 1996, compared with 11.2
percent of whites, according to government data. Death rates for
African-Americans from all causes are 1.6 times higher than for
white Americans, Dr. David R. Williams of the University of
Michigan's Institute for Social Research, said at the Bethesda
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy for blacks and whites also varies. At age 45, a
white man can expect to live five years longer than an
African-American man, and white women can expect to live 3.7 years
longer than their black counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   If socioeconomic status is taken into account, health
differences between blacks and whites decrease substantially: Black
men in the highest income brackets, for example, have a life
expectancy 7.4 years longer than black men in the lowest brackets,
Williams said. White men at top income levels live 6.6 years longer
than their lowest-income counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   But race and to some extent sex still have an impact on health
that is independent of social class. The gap in infant mortality
rates between blacks and whites, for example, actually increases
with higher social status. And being black or female discounts some
of the advantages afforded by education: white men accrue health
advantages with every additional year of schooling they receive.
But black men and women, though they also show gains, show them
only through high school, according to an analysis of federal data
by Adler and Dr. Burton Singer of Princeton University's Office of
Population Research. White women, the researchers found, continue
to gain in health status through college, but unlike white men, do
not receive the gains in health bestowed by post-graduate
education.
</P>
<P>
   Social exclusion, residential segregation and other expressions
of institutional racism magnify the impact of socioeconomic status.
Several studies, for example, have shown higher adult and infant
mortality rates for people living in segregated areas.
</P>
<P>
   For both blacks and whites, living in a neighborhood where
social bonds have eroded may have negative effects on health. Dr.
Robert Putnam of Harvard University coined the term ``social
capital'' to describe the elements that contribute to social
cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ichiro Kawachi, director of the Harvard Center for Society
and Health, has explored one aspect of social capital _
interpersonal trust _ and its relationship to national and
community rates of illness and death.
</P>
<P>
   Kawachi and his colleagues correlated mortality rates in states
with the percentage of state residents who agreed with the
statement, ``Most people would try to take advantage of you if they
got the chance.'' Death rates, Kawachi reported at the Bethesda
conference, were strongly linked to level of social trust, with the
most mistrustful ratings clustering in southern and northeastern
states. Another study, of Chicago neighborhoods, yielded similar
findings: neighborhoods in which more residents agreed with the
statement ``Neighbors can be trusted'' had lower mortality rates.
</P>
<P>
   Why are neighborhoods or states with higher levels of trust
healthier? Kawachi suggests that in neighborhoods where social
trust is high, negative health behaviors _ smoking and alcohol
consumption, for example _ might be discouraged through community
pressure. Residents in high trust neighborhoods may also share more
resources, be more willing to help one another out and offer one
another more emotional support. ``It is speculation,'' Kawachi
said, ``but probably these little things add up to quite important
health differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the relationship between social class and health is
unlikely to be entirely explained by social capital, or by any
other single dimension of life experience. Said Adler, ``There
isn't going to be a single explanation or an easy solution, but
we've started mapping out some of the places where we can
intervene.'' &QL;

   Hiking is wildly popular these days, as are rafting and
bicycling. So Backroads, a travel company in Berkeley, Calif., did
not need a computer program to grasp that a combination would sell.
According to Megan Gaynor, a spokeswoman, these trips, begun only
in 1997, are the fastest growing in the company's catalog.
</P>
<P>
   These, like other physically rugged trips on horseback, bike,
raft and kayak, are starting to sell out for this season, mostly
because each trip has only a few spaces to begin with. But many
operators have dates still open for those willing to shop. Here is
a glance at a few trips, with suggestions for further looking. &QL;
</P>
<P>

   A Triathlon of Sorts
</P>
<P>
   One of Backroads' multisport trips is ``Canadian Rockies
Kananaskis,'' for 20 people in two kinds of housing: tents and
cabins, or inns and lodges. The site for these trips, Kananaskis
(pronounced kah-nan-NANS-kiss) Country, is centered on the village
of Kananaskis, west of Calgary, Alberta, in an area of mountains,
lakes and forests.
</P>
<P>
   In the inn-lodge version, these six-day, five-night trips, all
meals included, cost $1,598 a person, double occupancy; the
double-occupancy cost is $898 in the tent-cabin version in areas
with coin-operated showers. Bicycles can be rented.
</P>
<P>
   In the tent version, the first day involves a 90-minute van ride
to the campground and a warm-up bike ride. The morning of the
second day brings a 20- or 25-mile bike trip _ participants pick
the difficulty _ and the afternoon, a raft trip with Class 1 to 3
rapids (6 is the most difficult). The next day brings an eight- or
nine-mile hike with a 1,600-foot climb. Bike trips and hikes occupy
the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the rugged schedule, Ms. Gaynor said that the
company let people drop out and ride after part of a day, but that
fitness was important.
</P>
<P>
   The tent trips leave on Sundays from July 4 through Aug. 29; the
Aug. 15 and July 25 trips are full; those on July 11 and 18 are for
families (children over 9 are allowed), and those Aug. 8, 22 and 29
for single travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The inn versions start July 25, with the last on Aug. 29. Those
on July 25 and Aug. 8 are for single travelers.

Bear Basin Ranch in Westcliffe, Colo., a two-hour drive southwest
of Colorado Springs, offers five-day pack trips in the Sangre de

accommodates eight guests and two guides; one pack horse is
provided for each two riders.
</P>
<P>
   The participants should have riding experience and should be
prepared for activity above 11,500 feet, and for total lack of
facilities; Dave Wiggins, president of American Wilderness, said
that one mountain pass was above 13,000 feet. Three-person dome
tents are set up to accommodate one or two travelers, and pit
toilets are used.
</P>
<P>
   Most travelers come alone, he said, although families are
welcome. It is recommended that children be at least 16 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about accommodating vegetarians, Wiggins said, as did all
the others, that with notice this was not a problem. ``In fact, we
don't prepare much meat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cost is $810 a person for five days and four nights.
Sleeping bags can be rented.

   Kayaking Off Maine
</P>
<P>
   The Maine Island Kayak Co. runs courses and trips, some of which
are demanding. Among them are five-day, four-night trips to
Penobscot Bay or the Fundy Isles. The company owner, Tom Bergh,
says both of these are for adults.
</P>
<P>
   Single-paddler kayaks are used, and tents and cooking gear are
carried along. The company supplies everything but sleeping bags.
</P>
<P>
   These trips accommodate six to eight travelers and two guides.
The paddling route is selected each day, with an eye on the
weather; camps are set up on various islands each evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Penobscot Bay trip, which starts on Little Deer Isle, may
involve paddling around Vinalhaven or Isle au Haut. The price is
$750 a person, and trips leave June 21, July 26, Aug. 23 and Sept.
13.

<P>
   Outdoor Adventure River Specialists (OARS), in Angels Camp,
Calif., operates five-night trips on the Middle Fork of the Salmon
River in Idaho. These trips, which start every seven or eight days
all summer, accommodate 24 travelers and 6 guides, using dories,
boats with oars, rubber rafts and inflatable one- or two-paddler
kayaks. Participants may try various boats in Class 3 and Class 4
rapids, said Eric Grathwol, the marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   The trip is affected by the seasonal shift in the river,
Grathwol said: In May and early June, when the water is high, the
trip is demanding and the minimum age is 15. When the water is
calmer, in late June and in July, 9-year-olds are accepted.
Families tend to come in August, he said, and anglers in September.
</P>
<P>
   The price, including all equipment, in May, June, August and
early September is $1,509 a person; in July, $1,625. When the water
drops in September, the trips are shorter _ four days and three
nights, for $1,315.

   The National Outdoor Leadership School, or NOLS, has been in
business for 34 years and now has headquarters in Wyoming. Its
whitewater, horse-packing and rock-climbing courses in the lower 48
states are virtually filled this summer, although Tom Reed, a
spokesman, says there are waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
   This organization usually discourages couples and families
because it wants each participant to interact with the others, he
said. It also stresses good physical conditioning, and while there
is transportation back for participants who find that they cannot
cope, the organization does not give refunds to them.
</P>
<P>
   There are openings on two 20-day canoe trips on the South

   MORINI, Albania _ NATO planes bombarded Serbian positions in
southern Kosovo for much of Monday, dropping bombs only yards from
Albania's border, as refugees crossed over against a backdrop of
billowing black smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, America,'' Kadrush Demir, a 22-year-old farmer from
Kosovo, said approvingly after arriving in Albania, as yet another
explosion shook the town of Verbnice, over the border in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees _ among 200 or so who arrived in Albania on Monday
_ said none of them were hurt in the explosions, though several
bombs dropped only a few hundred yards away on what they said were
groups of Serbian soldiers near the border.
</P>
<P>
   Most the refugees appeared to be more of the men who reported
that they were imprisoned for several days or weeks by Serbian
forces. In the last eight days, about 2,500 men have crossed into
Albania saying that they had been held captive at a jail in
northern Kosovo. Nearly all reported that they had been beaten.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the men who crossed on Monday said that they had
been held in the southern city of Prizren. That suggests that the
Serbs may have broadened what aid officials here say is a
well-organized effort to extract information about the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the Kosovo Albanian rebel group fighting Serbian
forces, from men fleeing Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clearly now extremely systematic,'' said Rupert
Colville, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
``It's kind of a conveyor belt of brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   Demir said that he had been separated three days ago from the
women and children in a group fleeing toward the Albanian border
and taken, along with 40 other men, to a shoe factory in Prizren.
He said that they were not fed and were beaten often by Serbian
policemen, who demanded information about the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, without explanation, the men were all set
free.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat us,'' he said, as he wolfed down bread and cheese,
his first meal in three days. ``They took our money. And they
didn't need us anymore.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Throughout the day, NATO planes thundered above the mountains
along the border between Albania and Kosovo, dropping dozens of
bombs on several villages within sight of the border. On the
Albanian side, people stopped by the side of the road, children
craning their necks, and cheered as bombs hummed down to their
targets and exploded.
</P>
<P>
   In the late afternoon, Albanian soldiers moved their border post
back several hundred yards after bombs exploded on the Kosovo side
nearby and machine-gun fire rattled from Serbian positions.
Albanian military officials said that the bombed villages appeared
to include Gorozhupe, Planeje, Verbnice and possibly Zhur.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian forces also traded gunfire with rebel forces on Monday
in the hills just across the Drini River from the border crossing.
Officials with the Albanian military and rebel officials said that
Yugoslav soldiers continued to lob shells into Albania, hitting
four villages in a reported transit area used by rebel fighters on
their way into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   No one was reported injured there on Monday; but two people were
killed last week when the same towns were shelled.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The nearness of the NATO bombing and other fighting to the
Albanian border _ and to 100,000 refugees living in the nearby city
of Kukes _ was further evidence of what officials say is an
increasing danger here.
</P>
<P>
   There have been two sniper attacks at the border crossing in
recent days, including one last week in which a Chilean sound
engineer was hit. On Sunday, Serbian forces fired two mortar shells
across the border here. They landed only 500 yards from the area
where refugees are processed.
</P>
<P>
   Colville said that the shooting and shelling episodes further
underscore the need for the the refugee agency's plans, which many
of the refugees here are resisting, to move the Kosovo Albanians
away from camps near the border to new camps in the south and west
of Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely of paramount importance that we try to empty
these camps as quickly as possible,'' he said.

FOOD LAWS MAY BE STIFLING PUBLIC DEBATE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every week, it seems, brings a new food scare. And each scare,
whether valid or dead wrong, has the potential to jolt the nation's
diet.
</P>
<P>
   But ever since apple sales plummeted a decade ago, after a
report by CBS News demonized the chemical Alar, food producers,
crying foul, have been fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   At their urging, 13 states passed laws to help protect farmers
and food companies from criticism that could lead consumers to shun
their products. One such law was used, unsuccessfully, by a group
of Texas cattlemen to seek damages from Oprah Winfrey, the
talk-show host, after she made disparaging remarks about beef.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, critics say those laws are putting a chill on the
continuing debate about what the public should eat.
</P>
<P>
   Though some publishers and broadcasters continue to put out new
reports on food, other media companies, especially smaller ones
worried about the high cost of defending a lawsuit, have stricken
information from manuscripts, avoided certain food issues or, in
one case, dropped a book project that was already at the printer.
</P>
<P>
   Food producers say they need protection against irresponsible
claims, but critics say the laws cut off debate on evolving health
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Catholic Church telling Galileo in the 1620s
that he was not allowed to trumpet a new viewpoint,'' said Bruce
E.H. Johnson, a Seattle lawyer who represented CBS in the apple
growers' suit. ``These laws are designed to lock orthodoxy in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   If the laws had been in place in the 1960s, Johnson said, Rachel
Carson might not have found a publisher willing to print ``Silent
Spring,'' her groundbreaking book on the dangers of pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``If society wants to continue to have safe food,'' he said,
``you need to have free and open discussion of the risks.''
</P>
<P>
   The laws, which are aimed at plugging holes in existing libel
laws, differ in each state. But because books and television shows
must play to a national audience, the statutes in effect are
reaching across state borders, causing consumers everywhere to get
less information about food safety.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Alec Baldwin, the actor, said he had recently approached several
television channels with a proposal for a documentary called ``The
History of Food.'' Baldwin contended that one executive at the
Discovery Channel balked when he explained that a part of the
four-hour show would be devoted to pesticides, herbicides and some
disputed practices used to raise beef.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Oh no, we could never do that,''' Baldwin said.
``You could see that these program people that we pitched this to
did not want these things discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Baratz, publicity director for the Discovery Channel,
which is a unit of Discovery Communications, said the executive
recalled the discussion with Baldwin differently. The executive
said he had not made a decision about the project because he had
not received a written proposal.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, editors at Renaissance Books in Los Angeles called J.
Robert Hatherill, a research scientist at the University of
California at Santa Barbara, to tell him they had cut long passages
from the manuscript of his book ``Eat to Beat Cancer.'' Gone was
information on growth hormones administered to dairy cows,
Hatherill said, as well as facts from a study showing the amounts
of lead found in over-the-counter calcium supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book is a very watered-down version of what I intended,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance, through a spokesman, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   And a year ago, Vital Health Publishing of Bloomingdale, Ill.,
canceled a book, ``Against the Grain: Biotechnology and the
Corporate Takeover of Your Food,'' after the manuscript had been
sent to the printers. The publisher had received a letter from a
lawyer at Monsanto Co. who said he believed the manuscript, which
he had not seen, included false statements that would disparage a
herbicide called Roundup, made by Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Lappe, a toxicologist and co-author of the book, said the
manuscript had already been approved by the publisher's lawyer. But
Monsanto's letter changed the lawyer's mind, Lappe said, because of
concerns that the publisher could be sued under the food libel laws
in other states. Lawmakers in Illinois have defeated efforts to
enact a similar law.
</P>
<P>
   David Richard, the owner of Vital Health, said he had been
trying to get insurance to protect against libel actions when he
received Monsanto's letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared,'' Richard said. ``As soon as I told my insurance
agent about the letter, he would not return any of my calls. I had
no choice. I had to let go of the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Drake, a spokeswoman for Monsanto, said the company did not
intend to suppress publication. She said Monsanto lawyers had
worried that the book would contain errors after they read a
magazine article written by its two authors that, she said,
included inaccuracies. The company was asking only that those
errors be corrected, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're respectful of differing points of view,'' Ms. Drake
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lappe and his co-author, Britt Bailey, later took their
manuscript to another publisher, Common Courage Press, which
published the book in November _ and has not heard from Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have brushed off the state laws as silly, so absurd
that they could have gotten former President George Bush in trouble
for shunning broccoli.
</P>
<P>
   And many lawyers who have studied the 13 laws say they believe
many will eventually be overturned as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Abrams, a lawyer who is an expert on First Amendment
issues, said many of his clients, which include large media
companies, did not view the state laws as a threat because they
appear to be unconstitutional. But other media companies, those
that cannot afford hefty legal fees, may feel differently, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of smaller publishers do not want to be sued,'' Abrams
said. ``They do not want to be part of some test case.''
</P>
<P>
   The agriculture groups that have been lobbying to have many
other states approve similar laws say the measures are doing just
what they were intended to do: causing people to think twice before
they make damaging comments that are exaggerated or untrue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers are tired of being victimized,'' said Steven L.
Kopperud, senior vice president at the American Feed Industry
Association, which first had the idea for the special laws to
protect food producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The laws don't inhibit anyone from stating their opinion,''
Kopperud said, ``as long as, if they are challenged, they can prove
it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, the association, which is based in
Alexandria, Va., sent a model law drafted by a Washington law firm
to state agricultural groups, many of which were angry after the
1989 report by the CBS News program ``60 Minutes'' about the Alar
sprayed on apple trees. The program cited scientific studies that
had concluded that Alar, used in large quantities, was probably a
carcinogen.
</P>
<P>
   After the report, many consumers panicked, schools pulled apples
off lunch menus, and apple prices sank. Even though most apple
trees were not sprayed with Alar, all apple farmers lost money, and
some farms went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Apple farmers in Washington state sued CBS, but a judge
dismissed the case in 1993, saying the farmers had not proved that
the report was false. If the new laws had been on the books, the
farmers might have had an easier time, though that is far from
clear.
</P>
<P>
   In statehouses around the country, farmers pointed to the apple
growers' losses when lobbying for the laws. Between 1991 and 1997,
Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana,
Mississippi, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Texas
passed different versions of the model law.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Robert Turner of Texas, a sheep rancher who helped
write the Texas law, said farmers need protection because often
they cannot sue under normal libel laws that prohibit false,
damaging statements about a product. Under those laws, a company or
person must be named by the party making the false statements to be
able to recover damages.
</P>
<P>
   But if someone, say, questions the safety of melons, Turner
said, all melon farmers, named or not, may lose money. ``Individual
farmers were falling through the cracks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In early May, Turner helped defeat an attempt by media companies
and civil liberties groups to repeal the Texas law. Three lawsuits
have been filed under that law, including the high-profile case
against Ms. Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   The cattlemen sued her after her 1996 television show on the
possible threat of ``mad cow'' disease to the American beef supply.
During the show, after listening to comments by an anti-meat
activist, Ms. Winfrey exclaimed: ``It has just stopped me cold from
eating another burger!'' The cattlemen said the show caused cattle
prices to drop, costing them millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But during the trial of their suit, a federal judge ruled that
live cattle were not a perishable agricultural product and that the
cattlemen could not sue under the Texas law, known as the False
Disparagement of Perishable Food Products Act of 1995. Instead, the
cattlemen faced the higher burden of proving malice, under regular
product disparagement laws.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, a jury in Amarillo, Texas, ruled in Ms.
Winfrey's favor. The cattlemen have appealed. Ms. Winfrey has so
far spent more than $1 million on legal fees, her lawyer said.

<P>
   Some people who have studied the laws say they believe they are
having a greater effect than can readily be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``These laws make people wary about what they say,'' said Rodney
A. Smolla, a law professor at the University of Richmond who
specializes in First Amendment issues and has criticized the laws.
``It is very hard to document people who don't speak. You're
documenting silence.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some agriculture groups have used the laws to try to quiet food
critics. In 1997, the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association
sent a letter from its law firm to an environmental group in
Vermont called Food and Water that insisted that Food and Water
stop distributing reports questioning the safety of irradiating
fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you are no doubt aware, nearly 30 state legislatures have
passed or are considering legislation which codifies a cause of
action against persons who disseminate false statements regarding
agricultural products,'' the letter warned. ``We must advise you
that Food and Water's actions will be closely scrutinized.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Stenzel, president of the United Fresh Fruit and
Vegetable Association, said his group did not want to cut off
debate but questioned the accuracy of Food and Water's statements.
</P>
<P>
   And in Ohio, where lawmakers passed a food libel law in 1996,
some people who have spoken out on food issues in the past say they
now hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I give speeches, I look around and think, `Does someone
have a tape recorder?''' said Laurel Hopwood, a nurse and volunteer
at the Ohio Sierra Club who speaks to groups about genetically
engineered food. ``I'm even afraid to say, `This might be
unsafe,''' she said, ``because I'm fearful I could get sued.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hopwood said she recently spent hours fretting over the
words in a brochure she wrote about genetically modified food. On
April 22, Earth Day, she asked other volunteers to help her hand
out the pamphlet. ``They were afraid,'' she said. ``They kept
asking, `Can we get sued?'''

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ If there is an overwhelming sense that
emerges from a walk through the squalid refugee camps of Macedonia
these days, it is despair.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is the newly arrived refugees who until last week
bravely eluded Yugoslav efforts to expel them from Kosovo, only
finally to flee in the face of dwindling food and unending fear, or
the refugees who have already endured weeks in the overcrowded
camps here, Kosovars are giving up on their dream of returning home
soon and are increasingly desperate to go abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, ethnic Albanians arriving from Pristina,
Kosovo's capital, described how they spent the last two months
determined to wait out the conflict and not bow to Yugoslav
pressure. After being expelled from their own homes in early April,
they simply moved from house to house, village to village, for
weeks, they said, playing a nerve-fraying cat-and-mouse game with
their pursuers.
</P>
<P>
   But as each week passed, as April dragged into May and now June,
their desperation grew and their determination waned, refugees
said. Sherif Krasniqi, 42, a librarian who fled Pristina with his
family last Monday and now hopes to go abroad, said the daily
disappointments were torturous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonstop we were listening to the news,'' he said. ``Waiting
for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, among the roughly 100,000 refugees who have
been waiting in camps here, initial optimism that the conflict
would be over swiftly has faded, along with the desire to avoid
resettling farther from home.
</P>
<P>
   The largest single source of tension in the camps is no longer
the at times heavy-handed tactics of local Macedonian police
guarding the camps, aid workers said. It is bitter disputes over
who gets to be evacuated abroad first. Journalists once besieged
with requests from refugees to borrow cellular phones so they could
tell their relatives they are alive, are now besieged with requests
from refugees for help _ help of any kind _ to go abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue is even setting in among the 140,000 Kosovo refugees who
are living in the community, with both refugees and the families
that took them in complaining that after two months, they are
reaching the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family we are staying with doesn't have any more money,''
said Hafiza Haziri, 48, a widow who was waiting last week to fly
with her two children to relatives in Madison, Wisc. ``They kept us
with food and everything, but now they don't even have food for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   As the conflict drags on, the rising despair and continuing
evacuations abroad are helping President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia achieve what is believed to be one of his primary goals.
The ``ethnic cleansing'' of Kosovo, the permanent reduction in the
number of Albanians living in the disputed province, is gradually
being accomplished. Before the conflict, some 90 percent of
Kosovo's population was ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Many Kosovars begin their journey vowing it will be a temporary
one. As Mrs. Haziri waited to depart for Wisconsin, along with 400
other people flying to the United States, she wept miserably,
insisting that all she wanted to do was ``go back to Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Bekim Berisha, 30, a doctor who is taking his wife and
1-year-old son to Phoenix to stay with relatives, said: ``I don't
know how long it will be. I hope it will be over as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But history is against them. In the Balkan wars of the past 120
years, few who were forced from home ever went back. Most of those
driven from Bosnia during its 1992-95 war have not returned, some
because their homes are still controlled by their wartime enemies,
others because the life they were forced to adopt abroad, while it
may be tough, in the long run seems better for them and, most
important, their children.
</P>
<P>
   The pressures that lead refugees to abandon hope of quickly
returning home are reflected in the tale of Afrim and Lumnije
Murat, two young Pristina lawyers who fled Kosovo recently and are
now struggling to decide what to do.
</P>
<P>
   When they set foot in Macedonia on May 22 after living in hiding
for two months, Afrim and Lumnije's only thought was of their
unborn child. For eight weeks, 28-year-old Lumnije, who is seven
months pregnant, lived a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Ordered by her doctor to avoid stress, she lived in constant
fear of a knock on the door from Serbian police. Told to have
regular prenatal checkups, she had none because her doctor fled.
And instead of a carefully planned diet of vitamins and nutrients
for her child, she dined on beans and potatoes, day in and day out,
for two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one miscarriage before,'' she said. ``I was afraid it
would happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Murat, a highly articulate, boyish-looking 28, said his father,
mother, brother and two sisters fled to Macedonia during the first
wave of expulsions in late March. But he was determined to stay to
protect the family home, which his father and grandfather had spent
50 years building and expanding. It was by far the family's biggest
investment and asset.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of fleeing the country with his family, he and his wife
hitched a ride on a tractor to a village outside Pristina. For the
next two weeks, they moved from village to village, fleeing Serbian
attacks until they decided to sneak back into Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   For the next six weeks, Ms. Murat did not set foot outside in
the daylight, fearing for her and her unborn child's safety. Murat
did the same, fearing he would be taken away by police because he
was of fighting age. As the conflict dragged on, their food and
optimism dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought at first when NATO started bombing that after a
week they would accept,'' he said, referring to the Serbs. ``But
the situation got worse and worse.''
</P>
<P>
   When police went through their neighborhood door-to-door on May
22, expelling anyone who remained, a long-running fear for their
unborn child finally took over. When the knock on their door came,
they fled to a neighbor's home through a hole in a fence. Hearing
trains were again running to Macedonia, they walked to a train
station south of Pristina, in the town of Kosovo Polje, the next
morning.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There, Yugoslav soldiers asked the Albanian men gathered if they
were college graduates, Murat said. After the men identified
themselves, they were led away. Murat did not raise his hand.
</P>
<P>
   After a grueling journey on a packed train that included another
night in a village and hours of waiting to cross at the border,
they arrived in the sprawling Stenkovec I refugee camp outside
Skopje two days later. Aid workers rushed Ms. Murat, who could no
longer walk, to a German field hospital.
</P>
<P>
   `'I'm tired but I feel better,'' she said the following morning.
``The baby is OK.'' She lay beside two women who had given birth
the previous night. One of the children, a twin, had died.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation that day, Murat vowed to return to Pristina
and was torn about temporarily leaving the region. If he went, he
said, he would be abandoning Kosovo and furthering Serb aims of
emptying Albanians from Kosovo. ``If I know a particular date, one
month or two months,'' he said, ``I would stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, his views began to shift. The thrill of escaping
Kosovo alive was replaced by the numbing routine of camp life.
</P>
<P>
   Their new home was a white, four-person tent they shared with
another couple from Pristina. Skopje already sweltered in late May,
with temperatures inside the tents reaching over 90 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Their beds consisted of three blankets. Their diet was a
variation of bread, soft cheese, milk and canned meat. And their
community toilet consisted of holes in the ground surrounded by
plastic sheeting. The stench is so powerful some people gag.
</P>
<P>
   With no running water or showers, refugees stand outside their
tents, pour water over their heads and wash their hair to give
themselves some sense of being clean. Some young people have shaved
their heads to avoid contracting lice.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions are uncomfortable but by no measure
life-threatening. Remaining here would kill no one. But the potent
force pulling the refugees abroad is the seemingly slow progress of
NATO's air campaign, the tedium of camp life, and the daily
spectacle of other refugees departing for what seem to be far
better places and lives.
</P>
<P>
   Barred from leaving without permission, the 20,000 refugees in
Stenkovec I are penned into a flat, dusty, 1-mile-long by
half-mile-wide monotonous maze of tents. There is little to do but
check the lists for who is headed abroad, walk in circles and while
away the time strategizing about how to get out.
</P>
<P>
   The situation here is far different from the camps in Albania.
There, the government has tried to strictly limit evacuations
abroad, arguing that they further Milosevic's goals. But the
Macedonian government has aggressively pushed for evacuations.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Macedonians fear that if the Kosovo Albanian refugees
permanently resettle here, the ethnic balance in Macedonia could
sharply shift and ethnic Albanians could eventually outnumber
Macedonians. The new plans to begin evacuating some refugees from
camps in Albania are a concession to Macedonian officials who are
trying to find ways to get refugees to move voluntarily from camps
in Macedonia to camps in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   On his second day in Macedonia, Murat's family visited after
hearing through friends that he had arrived. Speaking through a
chain-link fence, his mother urged him to try to go abroad. His
wife, who still feared for the baby's health, was eager to join her
parents who were already in Germany with her brother.
</P>
<P>
   On his fourth day in the camp, Afrim agreed. He explained how
his family needed a person abroad earning money to survive. And he
was less adamant about returning to Kosovo, saying the province and
his own home would likely be destroyed by withdrawing Serbs or
advancing NATO soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   He had resisted all he could in Pristina, he said, and still
hopes to return. But in the end, he cited a reason many refugees
did for leaving _ the same reason many may never return: his
child's future. ``Soon, she will give birth,'' he said. ``I have to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   If chosen for evacuation, the couple could be flown to Germany,
and be building a new life, within a week.

`BRIEF INTERVIEWS WITH HIDEOUS MEN': CALLING THEM MISOGYNISTS WOULD
BE TOO KIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How to describe David Foster Wallace's new collection of
stories? You might say it's like being a therapist and being forced
to listen to one narcissistic patient after the next, prattle on _
and on and on _ about their neuroses and their explanations for
those neuroses and the rationalizations behind the explanations for
those neuroses.
</P>
<P>
   Or you might say it's like being locked in a room with a bunch
of speed freaks babbling to themselves nonstop on a
benzedrine-fueled high as they clip their toenails or cut the split
ends out of their hair.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in ``Brief Interviews With Hideous Men,'' all of
Wallace's remarkable powers of observations _ not to mention all of
his manic energy _ are trained not outward at the world at large,
as it was in his 1996 magnum opus ``Infinite Jest,'' but inward at
the convolutions of his characters' shallow psyches.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the people in this book are members of what might be
called Inward Bound, and nearly every story in this volume features
``an element of self-consciousness'' that ``now was itself an
object of focus, like some sort of diffraction or regress of
self-consciousness and consciousness of self-consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting book is an airless, tedious production, virtually
devoid of the wonderful descriptive powers on display in Wallace's
earlier fiction and reportial essays. Absent too, for the most
part, are his antic sense of humor, his uncanny ability to limn the
surrealness of contemporary life and his zingy, idiosyncratic
prose.
</P>
<P>
   One piece in ``Hideous Men'' reads like a parody of Nicholson
Baker, providing a minutely detailed account of the emotions going
through a 13-year-old boy's head as he dives into a swimming pool.
Two other stories _ a dying man's rant against his son and another
man's account of his father's career as a men's room attendant _
read like imitations of the early Martin Amis: they are animated by
a sophomoric voyeurism, and a fascination (and disgust) with bodily
functions.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the volume's other stories (or ``belletristic pieces,''
as Wallace pretentiously calls them) are discursive portraits of
relentlessly self-absorbed whiners, set down in an unappetizing mix
of psychobabble, scholarly jargon and stream-of-consciousness
riffs. Few of these characters are even given names, and they often
seem more like generic types than distinct individuals.
</P>
<P>
   There's ``the depressed person,'' a woman so immersed in the
fluctuations of her own self-esteem that she can spend hours
complaining about her own emotional pain to a friend who is dying
of cancer. There's a writer (perhaps a stand-in for Wallace
himself) who babbles on for pages about whether to level with the
reader about his post-modernist narrative strategies or whether
this impulse indicates an embarrassing need for approval.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a self-absorbed woman who is relieved to discover
that her husband is a ``Secret Compulsive Masturbator'' because it
means that his distraction in bed isn't a result of her own
inadequacy as a lover.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt these portraits are meant as sardonic commentaries on
our narcissistic, therapeutic age, but they are so long-winded, so
solipsistic, so predictable in their use of irony and gratuitous
narrative high jinks that they end up being as tiresome and
irritating as their subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of this volume consists of equally numbing
portraits of ``hideous men,'' who reveal in a series of interviews
that they are exemplary chauvinist pigs. One hideous man
rationalizes his womanizing, trying to turn the act of cruelly
dropping his girlfriend into a self-pitying disquisition on his own
inability to love.
</P>
<P>
   Another says he calls his deformed arm (``a itty tiny little
flipper'') ``the Asset'' because of its ability to evoke pity in
women he wants to seduce. And a third says he married a woman who
``had a good body even after she'd had a kid'' because it meant
she'd been ``pre-tested'': ``the kid didn't blow her body out, so I
knew she'd be a good bet to sign on and have kids with and still
try to have sex.''
</P>
<P>
   These men run the gamut from the annoying to the monstrous. At
one end of the spectrum are two Beavis and Butt-head adolescents
chortling (``Heh heh heh'') over a voluptuous target of seduction;
at the other is a maniacal psycho who suggests that gang rape, like
the Holocaust, isn't necessarily a bad thing because it might make
its victim ``more of a complete human being.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear just what point Wallace wants to make with these
boring, repetitious and frequently repellent profiles, aside from
the obvious one of examining the ways in which men can take
advantage of women. There is little subtlety or insight to his
portraits: his men are so uniformly misogynists, his women so
uniformly victims that the reader who didn't know better might
easily surmise that an angry radical feminist had penned them as
part of an ideological screed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed this entire volume represents a sharp falling off in
ambition, nuance and vision from Wallace's previous works of
fiction, books like ``Infinite Jest'' and ``The Broom of the
System'' (1986), which aspired to give the reader a hip, tactile
take on millennial America while daring to combine the latest
post-modernist hardware with an old-fashioned love of character and
storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   In an essay in ``A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again''
(1997), ``Fun Thing,'' Wallace mourned the loss of engagement with
deep moral issues that distinguished the work of the great
19th-century writers, and he took contemporary writers to task for
using the tools of irony and sarcasm to avoid commitment and risk.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Brief Interviews With Hideous Men,'' he is
guilty of exactly those failings. Only one story in this volume _ a
sad, little elliptical tale titled ``Church Not Made With Hands,''
which depicts a man trying to cope with his daughter's injury in a
freak swimming pool accident _ evinces the lure and dazzle of his
earlier work and hints at the capabilities of this immensely
talented writer. &QL;

 &HT;    Lopez aims to live the dream of Open win
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's been stirring within her for about a month now.
When a U.S. Women's Open approaches for Nancy Lopez, so begins the
struggle. Can she maintain a balance of physical and mental
preparedness without becoming obsessed and overwhelmed by it all?
If so, can the most sentimental journey in women's golf move to the
non-fiction shelf?
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lopez wants a U.S. Women's Open as much John Elway wanted
a Super Bowl ring, more than Greg Norman covets a Masters title.
</P>
<P>
   And women's golf fans would like to see it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Chance No. 23 will come on Thursday in West Point, Miss., when
Lopez, the most famous carpooling Mom in Albany, Ga., strides down
the first fairway of the Old Waverly Golf Club hoping that her
karma, her ballstriking and her putting stroke might blend together
for a dream week.
</P>
<P>
   She's hoping that The Open that got away at Pumpkin Ridge two
years ago was not her last shot. She's hoping that she'll get to
stand over another 10-footer for a chance at the elusive USGA
trophy. She's hoping that a rush of tears that followed her missed
putt then, allowing a victory for England's Allison Nicholas, might
be felt this time without clenched teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me months to get over it,'' Lopez said during a
telephone interview. ``I thought about it every night. I went to
sleep every night thinking about it. I didn't think it would affect
me the way it did. I thought, `God, what's going on here?' It was
really a tough defeat. Usually, if I lose, I accept it and move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Move on? Yeah, right. Even two years later, when Lopez sees
Nicholas on the putting green or the practice range, she says in
jest, ``I kind of want to trip her as she goes by. . . . I pick on
her a lot, but she played like a champion and deserved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are Lopez still had Pumpkin Ridge on her mind last year,
when the Open was played at Blackwolf Run in Kohler, Wisc. In what
would become a tournament featuring Duke's Jenny Chuasiriporn and
Korea's Se Ri Pak, Lopez spent a nightmarish two days, missing the
cut by 10 shots with rounds of 77-83.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hated it,'' she said. ``It wasn't even fun. I was glad
I missed the cut so I wouldn't have to be 27-over by Sunday and
embarrass myself.''
</P>
<P>
   This week Lopez will be paired with Chuasiriporn, who makes her
professional debut, on a course where Lopez feels most comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Friends with owner George Bryan, she has played the course many
times during the last 10 years, occasionally by personal invitation
and annually in a charity event there.
</P>
<P>
   Will her experience provide an edge on a course unfamiliar to
many of the competitors?
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably,'' Lopez said, ``but I don't want to say that. . . .
I am excited about it, though. I have a good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Although victimized by recent mental errors, Lopez has been
striking the ball superbly, tying for 15th at Corning last week in
preparation for an Old Waverly course that demands crisp iron play
to small greens. Her putting is much improved since a switch to the
cross-handed style a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Lopez is 42 years old. She has arthritis in her left knee,
``bone-on-bone'' from where cartilage was removed several years
ago. It happens to most people who spend 30 years twisting on a
knee, especially when combined with recent years of pounding on
treadmills and stairmasters. She's been taking glucosamine sulfate
instead of anti-inflammatories that are harder on the body. She
regularly exercises in her pool, lessening the strain on crucial
joints. She's into magnetic therapy to increase circulation, and
senses some positive results.
</P>
<P>
   When Lopez wore a brace on the knee last week, concerned viewers
watching on TV during the Corning Classic began calling in
remedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be a little more pressure I've put on myself
because I know there are only going to be so more Opens that I can
win,'' Lopez said. ``I'm getting older and I've got to face that.
My mind's not older, but my body is. I don't do pain too well. I'm
a real baby when it comes to that. Sure, I'm hurting and people ask
about my knee, but I don't want to think that I'm complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez has for the first time brought her three daughters to the
tournament site along with husband Ray Knight, who typically walks
every hole from behind the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to change my luck,'' Nancy said, ``and bring
everybody.''

   Mexico Sets Entry Fee For Most Tourists &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starting July 1, Mexico will begin charging foreign tourists 150
pesos, about $16 at recent exchange rates, to enter the country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tourists arriving by air or on land will be subject to the entry
fee. But tourists who declare that they intend to stay within 15.5
miles of the border and passengers from cruise ships who stay in
Mexico less than 72 hours will not be charged. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents say that the fee is unlikely to discourage
tourists planning lengthy trips to Mexican beach resorts or to
colonial cities, who expect to spend hundreds of dollars on their
vacations in any event. But people traveling to Mexico on modest
budgets, including thousands of Mexican-American families who
travel by car or bus from border states to cities in northern
Mexico to visit relatives, could feel the squeeze. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mario Sanchez, a spokesman for the Tourism Ministry, said that
the ministry was aware of the risks and was studying how to
minimize them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want to discourage tourism or damage the tourism
industry,'' Sanchez said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that the measure would generate about $80 million a
year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Air passengers arriving in the United States must pay a $32.50
entry fee. Mexican applicants for a United States visa now pay a
$45 fee. &QL;

   Seeing the Earth With an Astronaut's Eye &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, people have looked up at the sky and watched the
stars and planets. This week the American Museum of Natural History
will present a view of the earth as it would look from the bay
window of a space shuttle in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Opening Saturday, the David S. and Ruth L. Gottesman Hall of
Planet Earth is the first in a series of halls scheduled to open as
part of the Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Center for
Earth and Space. Others, including the new Hayden Planetarium and
the Cullman Hall of the Universe, will open in early 2000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the attractions at the Hall of Planet Earth is a ``dynamic
earth globe'' eight feet across, onto which are projected, in a
12-minute loop, images of the rotating earth, showing such things
as dissolving clouds, then dissolving oceans to highlight the
topography. Other exhibits include 167 rocks from around the globe,
a model of a peak in Switzerland, ice core samples from Greenland,
and a sand model that illustrates how mountains are formed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the hall, visitors can see exotic black smokers _
chimneylike sulfide structures that grow along thermal vents on the
ocean floor and provide glimpses into communities where microbes
flourish and offer clues to the origins of life on earth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One interactive display allows visitors to explore ice core
records covering more than 115,000 years of the earth's climate
history, and another describes how carbon moves through the earth,
the atmosphere and salt rock. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A number of videos _ including ``Various Views of the Planet''
and ``El Nino'' _ will run throughout the exhibit. An Earth Events
Wall will provide news and videos of such phenomena as earthquakes,
volcanic eruptions and hurricanes as soon as they occur. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Suggested admission to the museum, which includes entry to the
Hall of Planet Earth, is $8, $4.50 for children, and $6 for seniors
and students. The museum is open daily. For information call (212)
769-5100.

   When Cotton Was King In New Orleans &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nights in 19th-century New Orleans were famously racy, notorious
for drinking, dancing and gambling; by day there was more serious
business _ most notably cotton. Before the Civil War, the city was
one of the busiest cotton ports in the world; boatloads of cotton
poured into the city and created the wealth that built many of the
mansions that still grace the Garden District. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cotton in all its permutations _ from plants, lush fields, tired
pickers, and plantations to art that the crop inspired _ can be
seen in an exhibition at the Historic New Orleans Collection, a
small French Quarter museum with extensive archives, through July
10.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 90 items in the exhibition are photographs of
steamboats and of grand houses built by rich plantation owners and
cotton factors, illustrations of machines that processed the
harvest, portraits of people prominent in the cotton world,
examples of the paper trail generated by cotton trading, ephemera
from the New Orleans 1884-85 World's Industrial and Cotton
Centennial Exposition, and five panels of a popular 19th-century
form of art known as pasties, removed from the walls of the Nitta
Yuma plantation house near Vicksburg, Miss. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Nitta Yuma pasties are collages of cut silhouettes placed in
a painted landscape centering on scenes of slaves returning from
the cotton fields. The work was done by a traveling artist, William
Henry Brown, who visited the plantation in the early 1840s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The show, titled ``The Fabric of History: The Cotton Industry in
New Orleans, 1835-1885,'' can be seen Tuesday through Saturday from
10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., 533 Royal Street, (504) 523-4662. Entry is
free. &QL;

   Setting Sail for San Francisco &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As part of the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the
California Gold Rush, a parade of barques, schooners,
square-riggers and other tall ships from around the world will sail
under the Golden Gate Bridge and into San Francisco Bay on July 2,
beginning at about 1 p.m. It will be one of the largest collections
of tall ships to converge on San Francisco since the Gold Rush,
when a virtual armada bore thousands of miners to California. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The United States Coast Guard training ship Eagle will lead the
parade, which will feature ships from Japan, Ecuador, Colombia,
Canada and Indonesia, as well as other United States tall ships and
historic vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty tall ships, most of them reproductions of 18th- and
19th-century ships, will participate. The majority are training
vessels carrying cadets. The largest ship will be Japan's 361-foot,
four-masted barque, Kaiwo Maru. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ships will dock along San Francisco's waterfront near
Fisherman's Wharf, from Pier 27 to the Hyde Street Pier, and will
be open for free public tours from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on July 3 and
4. On July 5 some of the ships will participate in a race to Long
Beach, Calif., that will begin 10 miles out to sea and cover 400
miles.
</P>
<P>
   All the ships in the San Francisco parade will be on view to the
public in Long Beach from July 8 to 12 and in San Diego from July
13 to 18. Information: (415) 556-0115. &QL;

ASSESSING BLAME JUST SHORT-CIRCUITS PROCESS

columnist for the Los Angeles Daily News. His column moves Mondays
in the ``f'' financial news file. Send your questions to P.O. Box

By KEN LLOYD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I delegated a project to one of my
employees, and although I worked with him and guided him along the
way, he needed an extension on the due date, and the final report
missed the mark. Now my manager tells me this is as much my failure
as his, and I do not agree. Do you? G.T.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: It is not a whole lot of fun to work for a manager who
plays the blame game, but in a technical sense, you can delegate
authority but not responsibility. When you are delegating
authority, you are delegating the power to get a job done, but the
responsibility for getting it done still reverts back to you.
</P>
<P>
   However, even if part of this failure arguably rests on your
shoulders, your manager should be directing his energy toward
solutions rather than problems. He should be focusing on the steps
that need to be taken in order to bring the project up to par and
giving you guidance as to the ways to delegate more effectively in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that since he originally delegated this project to
you, then some of the responsibility for its failure is his as
well. The problem is that when people are running around trying to
figure out who is to blame for what, all they are doing is
generating dissatisfaction, disloyalty and distrust, and this
increases the likelihood that future projects will fall short of
the mark as well.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, you should meet with your manager to discuss the
ways to bring this project to a successful completion. If he balks,
no one can blame you for having real questions about his skills as
a manager.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am beginning my career, and I want to know how to respond
to a job interview question about my goals if I don't have a
particular objective. I know what direction I want to go in, and I
want to do well, advance and continue to learn, and maybe my goals
will crystallize when I join the company. M.N.
</P>
<P>
   A: It sounds like you have more goals than you think. By
definition, a goal should be specific, clear and prioritized. On a
near-term basis, just as you said, your goal is to get a job.
Related to that objective, you want to perform effectively, be
promoted, and continue to grow and develop. The fact that you
anticipate that your goals will come more into focus after you are
employed can actually help that occur.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason why you cannot express these points during a
job interview. If a company rejects you because you do not know
exactly what you want to be doing in one year, five years or 10
years, the odds are that you would not be happy in such an
organization in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   You could concoct some goals that may sound good to an
interviewer, but that would be shortchanging yourself. Not only
would this force you to lie in the interview, but if this is what
it takes to get the job, you would be entering the company with a
false story, and such stories typically have unhappy endings.
</P>
<P>
   Many of today's successful leaders did not have crystal-clear
goals at the outset of their careers, and some still don't have
them. When it comes to articulating your goals, look to yourself
rather than to whoever may be interviewing you.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We cannot pay our employees very high wages, but we are
fairly competitive for our industry. With all the emphasis today on
how money motivates people, what are some things we can do, besides
money, to motivate them? H.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: Short of money, there are still many ways to create an
environment in which the employees are likely to be motivated.
</P>
<P>
   The starting point is to treat the employees equitably and with
respect and trust. Provide them with real opportunities to present
their ideas, suggestions and inputs in the decision-making process,
and keep the communication lines open.
</P>
<P>
   Give the employees a good deal of recognition when due, along
with opportunities to sense achievement, accomplishment and
personal growth. Training and educational programs, along with
opportunities to advance, can be particularly helpful in this
regard. The employees should also understand the significance of
their work and how it fits into the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   There tends to be a positive motivational impact associated with
family-friendly policies, programs and the flexibility to meet the
needs of today's employees. And, speaking of the employees' needs,
why not ask them? Employees often have good ideas in terms of
motivational programs, and those which they suggest often tend to
be the most motivational of all.

 &HT;    Latest conflict with Chinese to play out in U.S. elections
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Depending which has been in or out, China has long
been a field of political opportunity for both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who lost China?'' was a rallying cry for Republicans riding
the anti-communist wave of the early 1950s. Only a few years later,
John F. Kennedy used the crisis over Quemoy and Matsu, two small
islands between the mainland and Taiwan, to question American
military readiness in the 1960 presidential campaign. (Though
unknown to the American public at the time, that passing emergency
also helped generate the frictions between China and the Soviet
Union which Richard Nixon would later exploit to make his historic
overture to the Chinese.)
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to say what impact last week's release of the Cox
Report on Chinese nuclear espionage will have on next year's
presidential election, but it seems bound to play a central role,
by a kind of centrifugal force of events: Drop a bomb on Belgrade
and it hits the Chinese embassy. Follow the list of names in the
Cox Report _ Wang Jun, Johnny Chung, Charlie Trie _ and they
connect back to the campaign finance scandal.
</P>
<P>
   You can judge a book by its cover _ to a certain extent at least
_ and by its method of delivery. Multiple copies of the
three-volume report, bound in black and printed on glossy paper,
were express-mailed to newsrooms around the country last week.
</P>
<P>
   This departure from the plain-brown style of nearly all
congressional reports, including last year's articles of
impeachment, hints at the political impact which House select
committee chairman Christopher Cox and other Republicans intended
it to have.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of finger-pointing which has followed the
publication of the report make it more difficult to determine what
real implications the report's findings have for the nation's
military security. An analyst for the Cato Institute, a libertarian
think tank which maintains its independence from both parties, was
critical of the report for its lack of clarity on this question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really uncertain as to what's been stolen, or what's the
impact of this,'' said Ivan Eland, Cato's director of defense
policy studies. ``Even with a worst-case scenario, this needs to be
placed in context.''
</P>
<P>
   In Eland's view, the lapses outlined in the Cox Report do not
represent ``a quantum leap in threat.'' Any breach involving
nuclear weapons is a grave matter, however, and the report's
finding that the leaks go all the way back to the 1970s adds to the
uneasiness.
</P>
<P>
   The assertion by the Chinese government on Monday that the
nuclear secrets are already available on the internet and in
libraries is not terribly comforting, either.
</P>
<P>
   Only weeks after the Chinese government stood by as a mob
surrounded the U.S. embassy in Beijing, chanting ``Death to the
long noses,'' a government spokesman dismissed the Cox Report's
claims that Chinese businessmen and students were used as spies as
``typical racial prejudice.'' The government condemned the
congressional resolution on the anniversary of the Tiananmen
massacre, claiming the Chinese people _ presumably excepting the
Tibetans _ now enjoy ``unprecedentedly extensive human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder the report packs such a political wallop.

 &HT;    BellSouth Mobility adds pager to portfolio
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth is scheduled to announce today that its
interactive pagers will be sold by the unit that sells wireless
phone service, a move aimed at boosting both.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement between the two BellSouth units offers something
to both: BellSouth Wireless Data's already hot pager will get a
boost from the phone unit's sales force, while BellSouth Mobility
gets another way to make its service stand out in a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The interactive pager is the only truly national service offered
by BellSouth, whose local phone turf is the nine-state Southeastern
region. Unlike one-way pagers that receive messages, the
interactive pager permits the user to type responses that can be
received _ when all goes well _ within seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The BellSouth service competes directly with SkyTel, which is
being purchased by Mississippi-based MCI WorldCom. BellSouth claims
its pagers use a faster technology than SkyTel's.
</P>
<P>
   The interactive pager is marketed by New Jersey-based BellSouth
Wireless Data, mostly through dealers. However, it also will be
offered through PageNet, one of the nation's leading paging
companies, using both companies' names, said John Kampfe, spokesman
for BellSouth Wireless Data.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth Mobility offers wireless phone service through the
Southeast as well as in three other cities. The unit has sometimes
been faulted as a regional player in a matchup against national
players such as Sprint, Nextel and AT&AMP;T. Those companies can offer
lower out-of-town and long-distance rates because _ so the logic
goes _ they can save money by keeping traveling customers on their
own networks.
</P>
<P>
   But BellSouth of late has responded to that challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The company now has ``one rate'' plans aimed at high-spending
mobile professionals. BellSouth has also added Portico, ``virtual
assistant'' software that can route and respond to messages.
</P>
<P>
   Kristie Madara, BellSouth Mobility spokeswoman, said the
addition of the pager is aimed at giving the company more services
to offer each customer and is more than just an attempt to give the
service a national presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Portico, it's a great differentiator in the marketplace
where carriers are starting to look alike. I certainly think it
will give us a competitive advantage. It's another product that
meets the needs of a particular group of customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The pager can be purchased for $359 or rented for $20 a month.
The basic service costs $25 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Pagers and wireless phones are seen as providing different
services. BellSouth believes they will sometimes appeal to
different users, while some users will carry both.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things I can deal with without dialing a
phone,'' Madara said. ``Cell phones ringing in a meeting can be
very distracting, but (with an interactive pager) I can type back a
message and nobody in the room even knows I am doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The interactive pager has also been known to let two people in a
meeting send each other messages.

 &HT;    MediaOne rolling out digital TV in Georgia
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MediaOne will begin offering digital television for
the first time today, beginning with a small group of its customers
in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The service, to be called MediaOne Digital NexTV, will be
available to about a third of MediaOne's 95,000 subscribers in Cobb
County. It will offer 222 channels of music, premium movie services
and pay-per-view programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the next step in bringing customers the
products and services they've said they want,'' said Ellen
Filipiak, vice president for MediaOne's Southeast region. ``Our
customers want to control what they're watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is only the second market in which MediaOne, the
nation's third-largest cable operator, has begun to offer digital
television. The service was first rolled out in Detroit last year.
</P>
<P>
   Digital television requires a new network, which MediaOne has
been building in metro Atlanta for years. About 36 percent of the
operator's Atlanta system, which serves 570,000 subscribers, has
been rebuilt.
</P>

 &HT;    MediaOne rolling out digital TV in Georgia
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MediaOne will begin offering digital television for
the first time today, beginning with a small group of its customers
in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The service, to be called MediaOne Digital NexTV, will be
available to about a third of MediaOne's 95,000 subscribers in Cobb
County. It will offer 222 channels of music, premium movie services
and pay-per-view programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the next step in bringing customers the
products and services they've said they want,'' said Ellen
Filipiak, vice president for MediaOne's Southeast region. ``Our
customers want to control what they're watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is only the second market in which MediaOne, the
nation's third-largest cable operator, has begun to offer digital
television. The service was first rolled out in Detroit last year.
</P>
<P>
   Digital television requires a new network, which MediaOne has
been building in metro Atlanta for years. About 36 percent of the
operator's Atlanta system, which serves 570,000 subscribers, has
been rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving full steam ahead,'' said Filipiak, who added that
the pace of reconstruction will pick up in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The new network offers three next-generation services: digital
television, telephone service and high-speed access to the
Internet. So far, MediaOne has signed up 5,000 telephone customers
and 3,000 for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   None had yet been offered digital television, which features
sharper pictures and 100-plus new channels. That will begin

</P>
<P>
   MediaOne has finished installing the first equipment necessary

already is able to offer telephone service and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled next to receive digital television service are Clayton

MONET'S ENDLESS VALEDICTORY OF LIGHT AND WATERLILIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ If the rest of the world is allowed to indulge in
Monetmania, why not also Paris? So, after ``Monet in the 20th
Century'' drew 566,000 visitors to the Museum of Fine Arts in
Boston last fall and a further 813,000 to London's Royal Academy
this spring, it is now the turn of the Musee de l'Orangerie on the
Place de la Concorde to offer its own crowd pleaser, ``Monet, the
Waterlily Series.''
</P>
<P>
   With 60 paintings on display through Aug. 2, it is a smaller
exhibition than the one presented in Boston and London, which also
included some of Monet's Venice and London series. But in some
ways, by limiting itself to the waterlilies, or ``nympheas,'' that
absorbed most of Monet's energies during the last 30 years of his
life, this show illustrates more sharply why the Impressionist
master is considered also the precursor of Abstract Expressionism.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangerie has another plus: It is home to eight of Monet's
large-format paintings. Donated to the nation by the artist in
1922, these so-called ``grandes decorations'' were installed
permanently in the museum in 1927, the year after his death. They
normally share the building with the Walter-Guillaume collection of
Impressionist and Modern works.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are surrounded by a solid selection of the 250 or so
waterlily paintings attributed to Monet.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Georgel, the museum's director, who organized this show,
has a point when he says that nothing like this will be seen again.
Because the Orangerie will close on Aug. 3 for renovation, it was
possible to remove the Walter-Guillaume collection a few weeks
early to make room for the Monets. But when the building reopens in
2001, that collection will return and the ``grandes decorations''
will again simply be a stop on a tour of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there are always plenty of Monets to be seen in Paris,
at the Musee d'Orsay and the Musee Marmottan-Monet. Monet's home at
Giverny in Normandy, where he built the gardens, pond and Japanese
bridge that appear endlessly in his waterlily series, also remains
something of a shrine for art lovers. Yet for all that, the
Orangerie has demonstrated that, even with an artist as overexposed
as Monet, there is much to learn from a well-focused show.
</P>
<P>
   Almost by definition all the works in the exhibition (18 are on
loan from American collections) were painted at Giverny, where
Monet first rented a mansion in 1883. Seven years later he bought
the house and soon afterward began building the ``water garden''
that he would keep expanding and altering over the next 20 years. A
century later the garden looks much as it does in Monet's
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The first ``Nympheas'' in the show dates from 1897 and,
surprisingly, it was intended as a step toward the ``grandes
decorations.'' But in practice Monet did not return to the large
formats until 1914. Instead, in 1899 and 1900 he did a series of
oils of the Japanese bridge and the waterlily pond.
</P>
<P>
   And as with his earlier series of, say, Rouen Cathedral and
Poplars, the same scene was transformed in each painting by the
effect of light _ and the seasons _ on its colors.
</P>
<P>
   In the next group of works, the ``Paysages d'Eau'' _ literally
``waterscapes'' _ painted between 1903 and 1908, Monet's
fascination with light led him to concern himself as much with the
reflection of the sky and trees on the pond as with the waterlilies
floating on its surface. In some cases, with the reflection turning
the original image on its head, the light reaching into the sky
between two trees resembles a huge waterfall pouring across the
canvas. Perhaps, unknowingly, Monet was already moving toward
abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly when he presented the ``Paysages d'Eau'' to acclaim at
an exhibition at the Durand-Ruel Gallery in Paris in the spring of
1909, he was puzzled by critics who said he was reinventing
reality. A few months earlier he had written a friend: ``I am
absorbed in my work. These landscapes of water and reflections have
become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man,
and yet I so want to render what I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   This was to be the last exhibition of his lifetime. Indeed for a
while he stopped painting. In 1910 floods ravaged his gardens; in
1911 the death of his wife set off a depression, and in 1912 he
discovered ``with terror'' that he was losing the sight of his
right eye and that he had developed cataracts (although he refused
surgery until 1923). Then in his 70's, he could easily have retired
on his laurels.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in April 1914 he returned to work with new vigor, announcing
that he was going to tackle the large-format paintings that he had
contemplated 17 years earlier. He had built a large studio that
could accommodate works on a new scale. The Orangerie show includes
a number of ``grandes etudes d'apres nature,'' enlarged close-ups
of details of waterlilies and reflections of weeping willows that
served as preparation for the ``grandes decorations.''
</P>
<P>
   In these Monet seems suddenly liberated. Having long insisted
that he was an artist who painted what he saw, now spending more
time in his studio he began painting as much from memory. In the
summer months he would again work in his gardens. But the outdoor
easel paintings of the final decade of his life also show a
dramatic change in his style, toward what we now call abstraction:
his beloved bridge, for instance, is barely recognizable amid a
storm of brush strokes in autumnal colors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was the ``grandes decorations'' that Monet considered the
true climax of his lifetime. He began the first large panels in
1914 and by 1918 felt ready to offer two compositions totaling 12
panels to the nation through his friend Georges Clemenceau, then
France's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   When it was decided they would be installed in the Orangerie in
1922, he increased his donation to eight compositions comprising 22
panels (the largest ``grande decoration'' is more than 6 feet high
and 55 feet wide).
</P>
<P>
   But Monet was never satisfied with them and refused to release
them even though the Orangerie had been adapted to receive them.
Only after his death were they installed. Another 30 or so
large-format works were sold off by Monet's heir in the 1950s, when
interest in the artist revived. Four of these, including two from
the Museum of Modern Art in New York, are also in this show.
</P>
<P>
   Through his mastery of light, Monet succeeds in transcending
form in these vast oils to the point that reality hovers on the
boundaries of abstraction. Nowhere is this better experienced than
in the two oval-shaped galleries of the Orangerie given over to
Monet's eight ``grandes decorations.''
</P>
<P>
   After the turmoil of his ``grandes etudes d'apres nature,''
these paintings are almost breathtakingly silent, so silent that
they are difficult to walk away from. Fortunately, when the
Orangerie reopens in 2001, they will still be there.

 &HT;    BellSouth Mobility adds pager to portfolio
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth is scheduled to announce today that its
interactive pagers will be sold by the unit that sells wireless
phone service, a move aimed at boosting both.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement between the two BellSouth units offers something
to both: BellSouth Wireless Data's already hot pager will get a
boost from the phone unit's sales force, while BellSouth Mobility
gets another way to make its service stand out in a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The interactive pager is the only truly national service offered
by BellSouth, whose local phone turf is the nine-state Southeastern
region. Unlike one-way pagers that receive messages, the
interactive pager permits the user to type responses that can be
received _ when all goes well _ within seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The BellSouth service competes directly with SkyTel, which is
being purchased by Mississippi-based MCI WorldCom. BellSouth claims
its pagers use a faster technology than SkyTel's.
</P>
<P>
   The interactive pager is marketed by New Jersey-based BellSouth
Wireless Data, mostly through dealers. However, it also will be
offered through PageNet, one of the nation's leading paging
companies, using both companies' names, said John Kampfe, spokesman
for BellSouth Wireless Data.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth Mobility offers wireless phone service through the
Southeast as well as in three other cities. The unit has sometimes
been faulted as a regional player in a matchup against national
players such as Sprint, Nextel and AT&AMP;T. Those companies can offer
lower out-of-town and long-distance rates because _ so the logic
goes _ they can save money by keeping traveling customers on their
own networks.
</P>
<P>
   But BellSouth of late has responded to that challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The company now has ``one rate'' plans aimed at high-spending
mobile professionals. BellSouth has also added Portico, ``virtual
assistant'' software that can route and respond to messages.
</P>
<P>
   Kristie Madara, BellSouth Mobility spokeswoman, said the
addition of the pager is aimed at giving the company more services
to offer each customer and is more than just an attempt to give the
service a national presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Portico, it's a great differentiator in the marketplace
where carriers are starting to look alike. I certainly think it
will give us a competitive advantage. It's another product that
meets the needs of a particular group of customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The pager can be purchased for $359 or rented for $20 a month.
The basic service costs $25 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Pagers and wireless phones are seen as providing different
services. BellSouth believes they will sometimes appeal to
different users, while some users will carry both.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things I can deal with without dialing a
phone,'' Madara said. ``Cell phones ringing in a meeting can be
very distracting, but (with an interactive pager) I can type back a
message and nobody in the room even knows I am doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The interactive pager has also been known to let two people in a
meeting send each other messages.

RELATIVES OF TIANANMEN DEAD CALL FOR CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM with DAVID CHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Ten years after army troops and tanks were used to
smash pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, more than a
hundred relatives of the dead have petitioned the government to
open a criminal investigation of the responsible officials.
</P>
<P>
   Like previous demands for an inquiry into one of modern China's
most traumatic events, this one is certain to be rejected by the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time, the victims' relatives have tried to use
China's nascent legal system for redress. And they see this as the
opening round in a new push for answers to what their documents
call the ``bloody slaughter'' of June 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives, who are working closely with a dissident group
and lawyers abroad, say that if the Chinese legal system fails
them, they will seek an international legal forum, like a U.N.
tribunal or a court in a sympathetic country, that will investigate
the government's actions of June 1989 and assess individual blame.
</P>
<P>
   In two documents handed in to the national prosecutor's office
in the last two weeks, tailored to China's criminal code, the group
asserts that former Premier Li Peng should be investigated as the
``primary suspect'' in the killings. Li _ remembered for his angry
exchanges with students and his televised announcement of martial
law in May 1989 _ is today the No. 2 leader of the ruling Communist
Party and chief of the national Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Several military officers and former Beijing city officials are
also cited for their roles in what the petitions describe as a
planned campaign to shoot students and others, violating criminal
laws against ``intentional killing'' and ``intentional injury.''
</P>
<P>
   The petitions were signed by 105 people who live in China,
including close relatives of people killed in 1989 as well as
several people who were seriously wounded in the army attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the actions of Li Peng and other people
constituted a genuine crime and nothing less,'' said Ding Zilin, a
retired professor whose 17-year-old son was killed the night of
June 3, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ding, a relentless critic of the government over the last
decade and chief organizer of the victims' families, spoke Monday
by telephone from her Beijing apartment on the campus of People's
University. Since early May, she said, the police have not allowed
her or her husband to leave the campus, on threat of immediate
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The new petitions, while repeating demands that Ms. Ding and the
relatives' group have made in previous public appeals, represent
their most formal effort yet to put China's legal system on the
spot over the 1989 killings. But China's courts have never acted
independently in cases that are politically sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   The petitioners' strategy, worked out with lawyers here and in
the United States, is to exhaust domestic legal options as the
first step toward a campaign for an international inquiry into the
events. They have been inspired, for instance, by the Spanish
arrest warrant for Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean
dictator, that led to his detention by Britain long after his
alleged crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The victims' group is working closely with a dissident group in
New York, Human Rights in China, which will coordinate the
international legal campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the Tiananmen massacre was a crime against
humanity,'' Xiao Qiang, executive director of Human Rights in
China, said in a telephone interview. ``This is just the first
step,'' he said of the petitions delivered in Beijing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The human rights group plans to release further details on
Tuesday at a news conference in New York.
</P>
<P>
   As corroborating evidence in their appeal, the relatives' group
provided names and details of 155 people who were killed and 65
people who were wounded in the attacks by the army and the police
on June 3 and 4, 1989. ``Not one was engaged in any violent
behavior,'' the group says of those listed. ``They were all
innocent victims of the massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of people who died in the crackdown has never been
disclosed, but it is believed to total several hundred at least.
The new list of victims, though far from complete, is the longest
ever publicly compiled.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party has firmly refused to reconsider its verdict
that the raucous 1989 demonstrations, in which hundreds of
thousands of students and other citizens marched or camped on
Beijing's central square, were a ``counter-revolutionary'' movement
that had to be crushed for the sake of China's stability and
development.
</P>
<P>
   Li, the central target of the new petitions, appears to be
securely in power today, a key spokesman for more conservative
elements in the Communist Party. The group's decision to cite Li
and other living officials as targets for criminal indictment
assures a hostile reaction from the Communist Party and the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Western and Chinese experts believe that the final decision to
use military force to clear students from Tiananmen Square was made
by Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader who died in 1997, and that
the military operations were directed by Yang Shangkun, who died
last September.
</P>
<P>
   But the new petitions say Li, as premier, bore major
responsibility for the killings because of his role in declaring
martial law, because he ``failed to stop the cruel killings of
civilians,'' and because he ``tried to cover up these crimes,''
praising the army for its achievements in the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the attacks on unarmed civilians ``systematic and
organized,'' the petitions say several military leaders should be
held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   The first petition calling for a criminal inquiry was delivered
on May 17 by Zhang Xianling, 62 and Su Bingxian, 64, both mothers
of young men shot dead on June 4, 1989. They took the petition to
the front gate of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the agency
that prosecutes crimes. Eventually an official emerged and took the
document, they reported, promising an answer that has not come.
</P>
<P>
   On May 24, the same two women delivered a second document
providing more details of the group's demands to guards at that
same gate.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone Monday, officials in the information
section of the Supreme Procuratorate said they had no knowledge of
the petitions and could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ding and other organizers of the victims' group know that
they are pushing the authorities to the limit, risking arrest and
prison. Working with exiled dissidents against the interests of the
Communist Party is often declared a major crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since my son died in 1989, there's nothing more that can scare
me,'' Ms. Ding said Monday. ``I do what I choose to do according to
my own conscience.''

 &HT;    McGwire quietly returns to South Florida
 &HT;    By Dan Graziano
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ So, Mark McGwire and the St. Louis
Cardinals come to town today. Remember the last time that happened?
It was last September when McGwire electrified South Florida and
all of baseball by hitting his 56th, 57th, 58th and 59th home runs
of the season in two games at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The sold-out stadium was rocking, and fans were blissfully
risking their health by diving all over (and under) the outfield
tarps to retrieve the precious home-run balls.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that? Well, this isn't going to be quite the same.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, McGwire played, despite missing Saturday's game in Chicago
after being hospitalized for treatment of a staph infection in his
right leg. But, attendance figures for the four games are expected
to be in the 20,000s _ good compared to the Marlins' typical
weeknights, but nothing approaching the sold-out fiestas of last
season. And they won't be taking the tarps off the upper-deck seats
in left field.
</P>
<P>
   They have nearly sold out the left-field club seats, which is
the location from which the Marlins' radio broadcasters will call
the game. They've sectioned off part of the section in left and are
calling it ``Home Run Alley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any giveaways, but we are highlighting the fact
that Mark McGwire will be coming to town for his only visit of the
season,'' said Mark Geddis, director of marketing communications.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Marlins will show a short video
presentation in tribute to McGwire's accomplishments here last
season.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has played only six games at Pro Player Stadium in his
career, but he's hit six home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of guys in baseball who have that threat, but
their home runs don't go 700 feet,'' Marlins interim manager Fredi
Gonzalez said. ``If they're solo home runs, I wouldn't mind
watching a couple. If we win 10-2 and he hits two solo homers,
that's fine.

   TORREON, Mexico _ Maria Torres Garcia turned on a faucet in her
home one recent morning and watched a little trickle run into the
bucket she uses to collect water during the few hours a day when
water still flows into homes here.
</P>
<P>
   Later the same day, Mrs. Torres raised her umbrella _ to shield
against the sun, since it has not rained in Torreon since last
August _ and trudged a mile or so away to the Nazas River _
actually to its parched bed, since the water dried up completely in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   There, Ms. Torres joined a throng of 6,000 other Roman Catholics
who gathered to pray for relief from a withering drought that is
killing livestock, draining reservoirs and forcing hundreds of
towns across northern Mexico to limit their consumption of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father, grant to us and to our fields the water we need,''
Mrs. Torres said, repeating with thousands of others a common
prayer led by Archbishop Jose Trinidad Medel Perez, who presided
over the Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In Torreon, a city in Coahuila state, 600 miles north of the
capital, and all across the country's arid north, Mexicans have
been praying for rain. Late last week, the federal government
declared 10 northern states, covering about half the country,
disaster zones because of the drought.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have explained the mounting water shortage as one of
the vagaries of nature, since for several years rainfall has been
lower than usual in northern Mexico. But Torreon residents, and
several experts as well, contend that deforestation, wasteful
irrigation and water-intensive industrial processes ill-suited to
an arid region, have worsened the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Torreon faces Gomez Palacio, in the state of Durango, across the
Nazas River. Together with Lerdo, Durango, the cities form a single
metropolis of 1 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Jose Gomez, the manager of Torreon's municipal water
system, said that punching thousands of deep wells in the region to
irrigate fields of alfalfa and other cattle-feed crops has consumed
so much water since the 1950s that the aquifers under Torreon have
dropped hundreds of feet. The water table fell 30 feet just in the
last year, Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico's water shortage is worsening because of bad
policies,'' he said in an interview during a regional water
conference, held in a Torreon hotel hours before the evening Mass
at the Nazas River. ``The water's been wasted. That's why we have a
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference brought state and municipal officials from
Durango, Coahuila and Zacatecas states together with ranchers and
businessmen to discuss strategies for confronting the water crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The conference reflected an increasing sense of urgency among
local and federal officials about the severity of the country's
water problem. Some prominent business leaders and
environmentalists have begun to criticize the distorted utility
price structures that encourage the waste of water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   During the water conference, Ulises Adame de Leon, Durango's
minister of agriculture, described uncontrolled logging that he
said was leveling forests all across Mexico's mountainous northern
watersheds, which act as funnels to replenish the region's
underground aquifers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine the destruction,'' Adame said. ``Hundreds of
trucks are carrying logs out of those mountains every day. If we
don't act, the cutting is going to turn our watershed into a desert
in 10 years.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, from Mexico's Green Party, has been
speaking out about the dangers of continuing deforestation and its
relation to the water scarcity.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico City, federal officials have issued repeated emergency
declarations about the drought up north, which has become entangled
in the politics of an emerging presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his last acts as interior minister before resigning to
seek the presidential nomination of Mexico's governing party,
Francisco Labastida Ochoa signed proclamations declaring the states
of Durango, Coahuila, Chihuahua, Sinaloa and Sonora to be disaster
areas.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition parties cried foul because the governors of all
five states are from the governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party, while other states suffering from drought but governed by
opposition parties were not included.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry said the five states were extended
disaster aid first because they had requested it first. But after
days of criticism, the Interior Ministry gave disaster aid to
Zacatecas, whose governor belongs to the opposition Party of the
Democratic Revolution, as well as to San Luis Potosi, also led by
the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they made a political mistake and then corrected
themselves,'' Ricardo Monreal, the Zacatecas governor, said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Later last week, the Interior Ministry also declared the states
of Baja California Sur and Nuevo Leon, both governed by the
opposition, and Tamaulipas, led by the governing party, to be
disaster zones. The federal aid is intended to help farmers keep
herds of cattle and sheep alive by providing forage, and to help
the states improve their conservation infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   But some Torreon residents took matters into their own hands. In
one working-class neighborhood where water runs from household taps
only from about 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. weekdays, residents became
irritated over the apparent waste of water by a factory that washes
enormous amounts of denim fabric used in making jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Until new drainage pipes were installed recently, the factory's
used water ran through an open channel, where it was visible to
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a river of water, running blue,'' said Rogelio Garcia
Triana, a sign maker who lives near the factory, and who also
attended the open-air Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood residents surrounded the plant recently in an
attempt to close it down, but dispersed after police arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think it's fair for a plant to waste water when our city
is so dry?'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   At the makeshift altar, a priest from a Torreon parish, the Rev.
Manuel Chavez, urged worshippers not only to issue a plea for
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's also ask forgiveness for what we've done to a world that
was once perfect,'' he said.

 &HT;    Vouchers debate halts vote on tax-cut package
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ State lawmakers appeared well on their way to
approving about $2 billion in tax cuts Sunday until the dreaded
``voucher'' word arose, grinding progress to a halt in the House
and Senate, which both faced a midnight deadline to complete
substantive work on proposed laws.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats opposed to using tax-funded vouchers for private
school education late Sunday said they believed that a tax credit
proposal added to a bill meant to give $506 million in business and
tax credits was an attempt to create a voucher-type program.
Vouchers for private school tuition have been a heated topic in the
Legislature this year. Opponents have blocked all attempts to
attach such programs to several proposals this year and killed two
voucher-program bills in House and Senate committees.
</P>
<P>
   Senate lawmakers earlier Sunday approved the business and sales
tax-cut bill without debate on the voucher issue. But officials
from one Senate office said the same language opposed by House
Democrats was reviewed and judged not to create a voucher program.
Senate lawmakers, however, briefly stalled their debate on a $3.9
billion school finance proposal, including local school property
tax cuts, teacher pay raises and new education spending, to await
House action on the business and sales tax-cut bill. They later
approved the education bill, sending it to the governor, who is
expected to sign it into law.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Dunnam, D-Waco, said he supports the other programs in
the tax-cutting measure known as Senate Bill 441. But he said he's
opposed to any program that allows public money to go to private
schools. The proposal before the House was a House-Senate
compromise reached Friday on plans to cut taxes by $506 million
over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is an end-run to vouchers,'' Dunnam said.
</P>
<P>
   With Monday reserved for minor and technical adjustments to
already-passed bills, lawmakers could either vote for Senate Bill
441 or let it die at their midnight deadline Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Paul Sadler, D-Henderson, chairman of the House Education
Committee, did not allow a vote on a voucher bill in his committee
this session. He tried Sunday night to convince fellow lawmakers
that the proposed tax credit for before- and after-school programs
did not amount to publicly paid private school educations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, Texas corporations could get tax credits for
donations made to various institutions that offer before- and
after-school programs. The donations could be used for constructing
or remodeling a building for the program; purchasing equipment,
supplies and food for the program; or operating the program,
including administrative and staff costs.
</P>
<P>
   Voucher opponents, including Rep. Sylvester Turner, D-Houston,
said the program may not require the state to give up tax income
for private school tuition, but ``these tax credits do cover
everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said private schools could be among those institutions to
which corporations could donate money and get tax credits. He added
the state indirectly would be subsidizing the cost of private
school costs, allowing those schools to reduce tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler said donations to private schools could be eligible for
the tax credits. But he added that the building, equipment,
supplies and other costs paid by the donations would primarily have
to go to the before- and after-school programs in order to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it is not is a voucher for tuition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   in addition to the tax credit for before- and after-school
programs, the bill would give corporations tax credits for research
and development costs; capital investments and job creation in
counties with high unemployment and low per-capita income; and
investments in their employees' child-care costs. The bill also
would exempt from the state business franchise tax any corporation
that makes less than $150,000 in gross annual income. Only
corporations pay the franchise tax.
</P>
<P>
   While the education and tax bills had promised to be the
crowning jewels of the 1999 session, lawmakers passed scores of
other legislation Sunday as well. They included:
</P>
<P>
   _Requiring candidates and political action committees to file
campaign finance reports electronically.
</P>
<P>
   _Allowing the Texas Department of Criminal Justice to track some
repeat sex offenders after their release from prison. The agency
would identify the offenders who pose the greatest risk and require
them to wear electronic tracking devices and attend treatment
programs.
</P>
<P>
   _Requiring governments to prove a compelling interest to enforce
laws that would limit the practice of religion. The Texas Religious
Freedom Restoration Act has been a priority for Bush, who is
expected to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   _Requiring public school students to take more state
standardized tests and pass comprehensive exams to get a diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Austin city officials were relieved by the death of several
proposals to restrict its land development rules. One proposal
killed was Senate Bill 938, filed by Sen. Ken Armbrister,
D-Victoria, which would have prevented Austin from enforcing its
water-quality rules in its extraterritorial jurisdiction in Hays
County.
</P>
<P>
   The other bill, by Rep. Harold Dutton, D-Houston, would have
required a city to have identical water-quality rules in every part
of the city.

THAT EXTRA MUSICAL INGREDIENT, FRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The amateur soprano has reasons to fear Beethoven's
Missa Solemnis. Professional choristers don't take it lightly
either. It is the inner segments _the Gloria, the Credo and parts
of the Sanctus _ that make palms sweat and throats turn dry. The
high Bs, B flats, As and Gs keep coming, incessant, like battering
rams.
</P>
<P>
   The height is manageable, for a time. Sopranos by definition
live a good part of their lives above the G-clef staff. It is the
relentlessness and the duration of these attacks. Facing difficulty
like this comes in stages, much like the familiar ones for facing
death: fear, disbelief, anger, acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, in most amateur performances of the Missa Solemnis I
have heard, sopranos get the hard parts right and do less well
elsewhere. It is hard to explain, but perhaps fright unleashes a
new level of psychic energy, extruding the best from us in a
survive-or-die environment.
</P>
<P>
   Beethoven was deaf as a post when he wrote the Missa Solemnis,
but like any complete musician, he heard inside his head what he
was writing on paper. The high-flying passages are just one item in
a catalog of daunting peculiarities.
</P>
<P>
   There are especially the Missa's fugues, spit out at great
speeds in twisted, dense, crossing lines. Needed is a a kind of
breathless, teeth-grinding vigilance: one slip, and derailment is
upon you.
</P>
<P>
   At last Thursday's performance of the Missa Solemnis at Avery
Fisher Hall, Kurt Masur had all the virtuosity he needed. The New
York Philharmonic gleamed; the New York Choral Artists and the
American Boychoir knocked down one scary passage after another. It
was very impressive and almost too easy. This is not easy music.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Beethoven make things so hard for the rest of us? Mozart
and Liszt wrote music that likes to be played, though both are
difficult in their separate ways. One explanation says that
Beethoven was mad (which he must have been). Another is that he
didn't care (he said as much, famously, to a complaining violinist
about another piece): Beethoven wanted an effect, and it was up to
the performer to realize it.
</P>
<P>
   Another answer is that deafness had so isolated him from the
tactile and practical world of performing that the concerns of the
musician became remote from his thoughts. Composers in fact often
hear their music faster than performers do, probably because for
them the connection of thought to sound is direct, without the
middlemen that the listener requires: no violins to scrape, pianos
to pound or high notes to attack.
</P>
<P>
   A machine on the drawing board runs unimpeded. In motion,
friction comes into play. It slows things down.
</P>
<P>
   This might be why the metronome speeds that Beethoven later
attached to his pieces seem fast to us, so fast that the composer's
metronome has been accused of malfunction. Or are these tempos what
he really wanted? The better we get at playing the string quartets,
for example, the more quartet players argue for the latter, but we
won't ever really know.
</P>
<P>
   The more paranoid among us say that Beethoven knew precisely
what he was doing and that fear and physical strain were calculated
parts of the musical message. It happens elsewhere in his later
music, one example being the finale of the ``Hammerklavier'' Piano
Sonata, written five years earlier than the Missa Solemnis.
</P>
<P>
   So great is the effort to negotiate this monster of a movement
that palpable effort, even among well-developed piano virtuosos,
becomes part of the musical experience.
</P>
<P>
   It is the well-established struggle factor that makes
performances by people like Maurizio Pollini somehow inauthentic.
Pollini sails through the difficulties of the ``Hammerklavier''
with so little perspiration and apparent apprehension that we
barely recognize the music as Beethoven's.
</P>
<P>
   Impossibility has a history in the annals of musical
performance. One of the more famous examples is the Tchaikovsky
Violin Concerto, which was declared unplayable by those who tried
it first. ``Not possible,'' said the bassoonist first faced with
the nervous, whining opening of Stravinsky's ``Sacre du
Printemps.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are those who think that Brahms left out some of the
tortuous inner detail of his B Flat Piano Concerto when he played
the earliest performances. (Pianists still do, but won't admit it.)
Rubinstein adored the piano music of Albeniz and with his cleverly
self-deprecating charm didn't mind confessing that some of the
composer's bizarre complications were left on the cutting room
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet unplayability has less to do with the limits of human hands,
arms, legs, mouths and throats than it does with old cultures
meeting new ones. Musicians trained in Eurocentric conservatories
are simply not prepared for the fanatical, repetitive exactitude of
some Minimalist music.
</P>
<P>
   European music gives, bends, stretches and contracts according
to gravitational pulls of harmonic change; a lot of contemporary
music does not.
</P>
<P>
   Liszt and Mozart embrace what traditional training teaches us
and then challenge its limits. Liszt brooks not the slightest
blemish in phrasing; Mozart raises Czerny, Hanon and the dreary
tradition of scales and arpeggios to sublime heights.
</P>
<P>
   Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky heard new sounds within them and had
to go against received wisdom. Among their first jobs was to
persuade musicians that their methods were not as unnatural as they
seemed.
</P>
<P>
   And anyone who has wrestled with the physical problems of music
making, and taught others ways of dealing with them, knows that
persuasion is the operative noun. The conquering virtuoso, bulging
with muscle, is a dangerous image.
</P>
<P>
   If we are wise, we remember Plato's myth of creation, in which
the universe is fashioned not by fiat or force but by seducing the
elements of chaos. In much the same way, we woo the muscles,
tendons or vocal cords. We comfort them, soothe their anxieties and
explain.
</P>
<P>
   I wish that ``we'' were more inclusive. How else can one explain
the explosion of on-the-job injuries suffered by musicians of every
kind? Learning by brute will has done terrible things not only to
the quality of the music produced but also to the minds and bodies
of those who are producing it. And it is practiced everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Other impossibilities turn out to be seductive acts by
persuasive composers. Debussy, that most subtle of score-writers,
often writes piano passages on three staves instead of the usual
two, placing the notes so far apart that two hands can't possibly
reach all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, of course, is the sustaining pedal. With it can
come the lingering, echoing wash of sound from keys no longer
touched.
</P>
<P>
   But Debussy does not just tell you to use the pedal; a few of
those electrocardiogram-like squiggles placed underneath could do
that. He teaches you. First lesson: Musical scores are not
operator's manuals with instructions about what body part to put
where. Scores are visual maps of what the composer wants people to
hear. Second lesson: Think for yourself and listen. Are you hearing
as you play what the map says?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some impossibilities are simply impossible. One finds
them in freshman conservatory classes where aspiring composers
still don't know what particular instruments can and cannot do.
Beethoven, a marvelous orchestrator in his earlier years, seems
sometimes to have miscalculated in later music. Those ``mistakes''
are the subject of many a conductor's furtive editing.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimate unplayability is offered by Schumann, who writes on one
page ``as fast as possible'' and on the next ``faster.'' Don't ask
me.

SHIPPERS HOPE FOR THE BEST AS CSX AND NORFOLK SOUTHERN ACQUIRE

 (HLW)  
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The companies about to divvy up the huge Conrail system have
certainly tried to do their homework.
</P>
<P>
   They bought extra locomotives, laid hundreds of miles of new
track, tested computer systems and settled with a multitude of
unions. They hired thousands of Conrail workers and managers and
spent long hours teaching them what the future would hold.
</P>
<P>
   That future arrives on Tuesday, as Norfolk Southern and CSX,
which already dominate commercial rail traffic in much of the East,
take over chunks of Conrail. The switchover will herald the most
sweeping change in a generation in the Northeast's commercial
railroads _ especially in the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   If the transformation goes smoothly, the effects will be felt
far and wide. With more competition, shipping costs should fall, a
benefit that could ripple throughout the region's economy in the
form of lower prices for all manner of goods. And increased rail
traffic could take business from truckers, which would have a
marked impact on traffic and pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this bonanza, however, could well come at the expense of
commuters. Many commuter lines in the Northeast share tracks with
Conrail, and increased commercial traffic could put a squeeze on
them _ and increase the risk of snags that would delay everyone.
Both railroads have had extensive meetings with local
transportation authorities to address these concerns.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, though, the focus is on the long-awaited
transition, and executives at the Norfolk Southern Corp. and the
CSX Corp. say they are doing everything they can to make it go
smoothly. For no one _ not the railroads, not the thousands of
companies that rely on them to ship raw materials and finished
products, not the consuming and traveling public _ wants a repeat
of the nightmare that followed another recent railroad merger.
</P>
<P>
   After taking over Southern Pacific in 1996, Union Pacific, the
nation's largest railroad, was mired in chaos for months, with
thousands of rail cars lost or misrouted and its major rail lines
clogged with traffic. Shippers faced such frustrating delays that
some, in desperation, had to go to Union Pacific's rail yards
themselves to search for their goods.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the debacle, in late 1997, the extra cost to
manufacturers, utilities and retailers along the Gulf Coast and on
the West Coast ran to an estimated $100 million a month.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific did finally manage to restore service to normal,
but the experience left many shippers nervous as the joint takeover
of Conrail drew near. So a group of companies put pressure on
executives of both Norfolk Southern and CSX to meet with Union
Pacific executives to try to find out what went wrong and what they
could do to avoid a chaotic encore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make sure they didn't repeat the same mistakes,''
said Edward H. Rastatter, director of policy at the National
Industrial Transportation League, a trade group that represents
many of the nation's largest rail shippers.
</P>
<P>
   Before the group would support the takeover, he said, it
insisted that the two railroads meet monthly with a group of
shippers to report on their progress. The group also urged the
railroads to avoid Union Pacific's mistakes by having all labor
agreements in place, testing information systems and completing the
training of workers and managers well before they began running
Conrail themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The top executives of both railroads needed little urging,
having seen claims and lawsuits from shippers mount against Union
Pacific. They met with executives not just from Union Pacific but
also from Burlington Northern Santa Fe, which was formed in a 1995
merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took extra care,'' said David R. Goode, the chairman,
president and chief executive of Norfolk Southern, which is based
in Norfolk, Va., and whose reputation for planning carefully and
paying close attention to detail has earned it one of the
industry's best safety records.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1997 that the managements of the two railroads, each
of which had sought to take over Conrail for itself, ended their
bidding war, realizing that even if one of them prevailed, it would
face major antitrust hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   That April, they agreed to buy Conrail jointly for $10.3
billion, with Norfolk Southern getting 58 percent and CSX 42
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But both railroads bided their time before taking over. They
also agreed to spend money to buy new equipment, including
locomotives, and to train extra engineers so they would have a
reserve if they ran into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken longer than we expected,'' Goode said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ward, an executive vice president at CSX Transportation
Inc., the railroad subsidiary of CSX, based in Richmond, said Union
Pacific's troubles proved to be an advantage in the transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made us pause and not rush the savings,'' he said. ``It
gave us the patience to do this properly.''

UNDATED: this properly.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The change was a long time coming. Back in 1976, Congress, with
much fanfare, created the government-controlled Consolidated Rail
Corp. out of the bankrupt Penn Central Railroad and five other
struggling lines in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1980s _ after a huge infusion of public funds to
replace or rebuild its aging locomotives, rolling stock and track,
over $7 billion all told, and repeated rounds of cost cutting and
job cuts _ the railroad showed stirrings of life.
</P>
<P>
   In this period, various attempts were made to sell Conrail,
either to a private company or to the public. Norfolk Southern was
once close to a deal, but it lost out when Conrail's unions and
managers fought back and forced a sale through a public offering.
</P>
<P>
   The government's 85 percent stake was finally sold to the public
in March 1987 for $1.9 billion, while its unions kept 15 percent.
Since then, the railroad and its shareholders have prospered, with
hefty profits and a sharply rising stock price. It has been a major
force in getting shippers to send their freight on intermodal
trains _ which carry containers or easily transferable truck
trailers _ rather than trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Thus CSX and Norfolk Southern will be dividing up a robust
competitor, one that has played a big role in helping sustain some
basic industries in the Northeast economy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A major goal of shippers and other groups in the Northeast was
to have two railroads compete for Conrail's customers, and the
breakup achieves that.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz Russell, director of policy and planning for the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey, said his agency had favored
dividing Conrail to insure ``that the region not end up with
another monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the agency and other groups were also able to persuade
both railroads to help revive some rail service in the various
marine terminals in the port of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there is practically no way to get goods across New
York Harbor except by truck or barge. A short line called the New
York Cross Harbor railroad has reached an agreement with Norfolk
Southern to help it build up the use of barges, which will move
containers, taken from rail cars, between the Greenville yards in
Jersey City and the Red Hook section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Also, some tracks on Staten Island's North Shore Line are being
restored with the help of the New York City Economic Development
Corp. This will enable containers to be moved by rail, by both
railroads, between New Jersey and docks in Staten Island. It will
also link the docks with trains that can go anywhere in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The New York region now lags behind other major cities and ports
in moving freight by rail. But these changes, Russell said, will
help change that. Huge containers now moved by truck will soon be
carried by rail, easing road congestion and lowering costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some shippers have already seen their rates fall by about 5
percent, he added, as the two railroads compete to sign up
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, of CSX, estimated that of Conrail's $3.5 billion in annual
revenues, about $1 billion came from what the railroads term
``jump-ball customers'' _ which, because of track layout, could
theoretically be served by either railroad.
</P>
<P>
   The two rivals have been fast off the mark. Between them, he
estimated, their sales staffs have signed up shippers representing
about 80 percent of that $1 billion by offering discounts of
roughly 6 percent to 8 percent. And in the push to compete with
trucking, many others could get discounts, too.
</P>
<P>
   Even after such rate cuts, he said, the railroads will be able
to turn a profit. That would be good news for stockholders, since
both railroads added greatly to their debt load to buy Conrail. CSX
stock is roughly where it was two years ago, while Norfolk Southern
shares are up slightly. CSX closed at $46.9375 on Friday, and
Norfolk Southern closed at $32.875.
</P>
<P>
   One big change is that with more extensive track networks, both
railroads will offer more routes on which a single train can make
the whole journey _ from, say, Atlanta to Chicago or Bangor, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   While containers generally arrive about a day later by rail than
if they were moved by truck, the rates offered by railroads are
about 15 percent lower, creating a strong incentive to switch.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Conrail did provide some competition for trucks, in
many cases ``there will be competitive service where none existed
before,'' said Tom Finkbiner, the vice president for intermodal
trains for Norfolk Southern.
</P>
<P>
   There has been little outcry from truckers, and some, seeing
rate cuts as inevitable, are even cooperating with railroads.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, everyone has been poised for Tuesday, when one of the
most complex transitions in railroad history will take place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're satisfied that they have done a superhuman effort of
planning,'' Rastatter of the transportation trade group said.
``We're waiting with our fingers crossed.''

ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL IN SOUTH AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ There was a last-gasp volley of
election salvos on Sunday night, the closest that South Africa's
second post-apartheid election campaign has come to a debate.
</P>
<P>
   The government-owned television network, which controls three of
the country's five stations, tried to set up a debate. But
President Nelson Mandela's heir apparent, Thabo Mbeki, declined to
take part.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing the governing African National Congress
likely to win the vote on Wednesday in a landslide, Mbeki no doubt
saw little need. Instead, the network gathered representatives of
five parties for what turned out to be a raucous discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's stand-in as the party's representative, Essop Pahad,
faced tough questioning on the economy, crime and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Tony Leon, the fast-talking leader of the liberal
Democratic Party, who showed off the quick tongue for which he is
known. On the subject of corruption, he said, the ANC has failed to
show much leadership. ``Under this government,'' he said, ``obeying
the law looks like a second option.''
</P>
<P>
   Pahad shot back, albeit a bit feebly, ``One can never take that
man seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heavyweight: Mandela
</P>
<P>
   Though Mbeki has been an energetic campaigner, crisscrossing the
country highlighting his party's achievements, it often seems that
it is the 80-year-old Mandela who is assigned the tougher
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela has not hesitated to talk to angry white farmers who
have been plagued by crime, traditional leaders who feel ignored
and mixed-race voters, who have never felt that the ANC had their
interests at heart.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an often grueling pace, Mandela seems to revel in his
campaigning, often recalling his humble background and always
urging South Africans to unite behind his party.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at a shopping center in the mixed-race neighborhood
of Eldorado Park outside Johannesburg, he was busy reminding
potential voters of all the mixed-race people in the Cabinet and in
other major posts when his microphone went dead.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, he pressed on. ``You can hear me,'' he told the
crowd. ``I used to shout at the sheep to get them to come home.''
</P>
<P>
   A Sly Poster
</P>
<P>
   Although South Africa has many advertising agencies that compete
to produce witty poster and magazine ads, the advertising for this
election has been stultifyingly dull. Most posters have
straightforward, rather lumpish slogans like ``Vote ANC'' or
``Fight Back _ Vote DP'' or ``Fight Crime Now _ Vote IFP.''
</P>
<P>
   The exception has been the National Party, which ran this
country for 47 years and still has a formidable campaign machinery.
Its posters change frequently. And some are not subtle: ``Hang
Murderers and Rapists _ Vote NP'' reminds voters that the party
favors the return of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But its slyest poster has been simple: ``Mugabe Has
Two-Thirds,'' a reference to the ANC's desire to win a two-thirds
majority in Parliament. The slogan counts on the voters' knowing
that President Robert Mugabe of neighboring Zimbabwe, once the
widely admired leader of a liberation movement, has become a
virtual dictator over a riot-torn country on the edge of
bankruptcy. Mugabe's party has 147 parliamentary seats out of 150.
</P>
<P>
   A Neighborhood's Hope
</P>
<P>
   The Greenfields neighborhood on the outskirts of Johannesburg
was once a sign of all that has been accomplished by the ANC. The
neighborhood did not even exist in 1994, when the first multi-race
national elections were held. Now, what was once a bleak hillside
is dotted with neat rows of modest pastel-colored homes.
</P>
<P>
   But look closely, and some of the new houses have already been
burned out. Installation of electricity and running water have
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The area has become a casualty of the political campaign. The
governing party's supporters have clashed there with supporters of
the new United Democratic Movement, started by Bantu Holomisa, a
former ANC official who was expelled for insubordination. Only last
week, a police officer patrolling the area was killed by sniper
fire.
</P>
<P>
   So far, more than 40 ANC supporters from Greenfields have taken
refuge in three tiny rooms at the back of a police station several
miles away. In one room no bigger than a sauna, 19 women and
children sleep piled up on the floor. Their stacked blankets reach
to the ceiling during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of the displaced feel they are better off than they
were before the 1994 elections. At least now, they own homes. Most
believe fervently that the ANC will take care of them when the
elections are over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, my house _ the doors and windows have been ripped
out,'' said Nkululekao Duka, 32, who before the last elections was
living in a squatter camp. ``But they have promised they will put
security there. They will solve the problem. I believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   A Lesson in Soweto
</P>
<P>
   The students at Anchor High School in Soweto were gathered last
week in the auditorium _ a graffiti-filled room with a peeling
linoleum floor, broken windows and only a handful of chairs _ for
voter education.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the students are well into their 20s. In the years
leading up to 1994, Soweto was in many ways ground zero for the
liberation struggle _ and youngsters, often at the forefront of the
movement, missed out on school.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are back. But the schools are a mess. There are no
textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing about where to get his identification papers and
how he should go to hear what the candidates had to say, Freddy
Tebogo, 23, walked away with a shrug. ``They say, `Youth, you must
vote,''' he said, ``but then they give us nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   First World or Third?
</P>
<P>
   In a shopping mall in Johannesburg, Tony Leon was weaving his
way through the crowds, asking for votes, shaking hands, engaging
in impromptu debates over the merits of the death penalty and, of
course, admiring babies.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign workers walked behind him, stuffing Democratic Party
pamphlets into hands already busy with shopping bags. In short, it
could have been a campaign stop almost anywhere in America.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the vote-getting looks like this. South Africa is a
country that is both First World and Third World.
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, Senzo Mchunu, the deputy secretary for the ANC
in the province of KwaZulu/Natal, was standing in a field in the
remote village of Ndlangubo waiting for a plane to fly overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get to places like this can be very difficult for our
campaigners,'' Mchunu said. ``Some of the people around here, if
they see campaigners, they are very suspicious. They think, `Ah,
they are here to take our land or our wives.'''
</P>
<P>
   So for three days the party conducted a sort of crop-dusting
operation in which a small plane swooped in on clusters of huts to
unload thousands of pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   How effective the tactic was is unclear. Many of the villagers
who came to greet Mchunu while he waited said they could not read.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Even as India continued bombing what it calls
a Pakistani-sponsored band of 700 guerrillas occupying a frigid
swath of Indian territory, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
Monday agreed to hold talks with Pakistan about this ``warlike
situation'' in the contested state of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, which are yet to be scheduled, will take place in an
atmosphere of deepening mistrust between two bitter adversaries,
who conducted tit-for-tat nuclear tests a year ago and matching
tests of missiles able to carry nuclear warheads in April.
</P>
<P>
   On India's side, the mistrust has become very personal.
</P>
<P>
   At the invitation of Pakistan's prime minister, Nawaz Sharif,
Vajpayee in February took the inaugural ride on a new bus service
connecting New Delhi and Lahore, Pakistan. The two men embraced and
promised to seek solutions to the issues that divide them,
including the status of Kashmir, which India claims as one of its
states and whose people Pakistan says should be allowed to decide
whether to join India or Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Monday, Vajpayee recalled his bus trip to Lahore in
describing his sense of betrayal now. As the head of the Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which has been hawkish on
India's relationship with Pakistan, Vajpayee's hand of friendship
to Pakistan had been seen here as a sign of hope that decades of
hostility might finally ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started the bus service to Lahore, it was to improve
relations,'' Vajpayee said. ``I went as an emissary of peace. I
have told the Pakistani leadership that it seems that while I
talked peace with you, you were preparing to attack our borders. We
still believe in peace, but you cannot clap with one hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians and Pakistanis have such diametrically opposed
viewpoints it is difficult to see how talks between their foreign
ministers here in New Delhi will produce any convergence.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Indians see Pakistan-backed terrorists grabbing Indian
territory, the Pakistanis say they see indigenous Kashmiri freedom
fighters seeking their right of self determination, with no
financial support from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   And just as adamantly as India has accused Pakistan of
committing an act of aggression against India, Pakistan has charged
India with provoking tensions by using air power in Kashmir so
close to the heavily fortified cease-fire line.
</P>
<P>
   Tariq Altaf, a spokesman of Pakistan's Foreign Office, said
Monday that Pakistan has asked India to stop the air raids and to
agree to neutral monitors or U.N. observers at the cease-fire line,
known as the line of control, which divides Indian and
Pakistan-occupied portions of Kashmir. These are all steps that
India has ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret that India continues to obstruct all moves aimed at
peace and defusing tension at the line of control,'' Altaf said
Monday in Islamabad.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pakistani officials have said Pakistan will protect its borders.
Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad on Sunday told The News, an
English-language daily in Pakistan, ``We will not hesitate to use
any weapon in our arsenal to defend our territorial integrity'' _ a
fearsome statement from a new nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   Altaf said Monday that Ahmad had not meant to suggest that
Pakistan would use nuclear weapons, only that Pakistan would not
hesitate to defend itself as it did when it shot down two Indian
jet fighters that crossed over the cease-fire line into
Pakistan-held Kashmir on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   India maintains that one of the jet pilots accidentally strayed
across the line after developing engine trouble, while the other
pilot was just trying to help his comrade. India accused Pakistan
of murdering one of the pilots with gunshots to the head and heart
_ a charge Altaf called ``absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that the conflict over Kashmir could turn into a wider
war, the United States and the United Nations, among others, have
encouraged India and Pakistan to seek ways to calm things down.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the two nations are clearly talking past each
other. Pakistan, which proposed the talks, has asked for measures
that India has said are not even on the table _ stopping the air
raids, or agreeing to a role for the United Nations in settling the
Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee said Monday that while India was prepared to meet with
Pakistan, India's determination to drive out the guerrillas hiding
in the rugged Himalayan mountains on the Indian side of the
cease-fire line was non-negotiable.

PLAYWRIGHT DAVID HARE TAKES ROLES OF PERFORMER AND REPORTER 
</HEADLINE>

(af) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He came upon the notion of a monologue about Israel,
David Hare explained, when it became clear to him that the Holy
Land far exceeded the possibilities of conventional fiction. It is
a perception that has only been reinforced by what has happened
since he took his one-man play, ``Via Dolorosa,'' onto Broadway,
including the stunning defeat of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The thread of the play, more a lecture by a thoughtful British
intellectual, is a lament for Yitzhak Rabin, a survey of the land
of Israel at the moment when its course is abruptly changed. So the
election four years later of Rabin's hand-picked protege, Ehud
Barak, amounted to a historical reversal, an event with such
dramatic force that Hare was stunned by the thin American
television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes historically clear that the intention of the
Israeli people was to go in the direction that Yitzhak Rabin took
them, that they'd been in a waiting room for four years,'' he said.
``There's a feeling now that Barak will resume the direction Israel
was going in the early 1990s, that there has been a needless
delay.''
</P>
<P>
   If David Hare the reporter watched in awe, David Hare the
playwright was a bit uneasy. The play, after all, is about a
specific time, and with the election that moment was now history.
The burst of press publicity only made the audiences more informed,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made no accommodation to any event since I wrote the
play,'' he said. ``Yes, it's a piece of journalism: to use that
awful phrase, a snapshot. But it's about profounder themes, themes
of the human soul. So it wasn't necessary every time to change the
detail.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to explore these themes through a straight, direct
report, stripped of any theatrical technique, was really a process
of elimination. Hare originally set off for Israel on an assignment
to write about memories of the British mandate, but aside from the
scarcity of these, he arrived at the moment when the assassination
of Rabin rudely lifted the curtain on all the profound conflicts
and drama of the country. Stagecraft simply seemed redundant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back with a simple journalistic zeal to say this isn't
what you think it's like, it's like something else. And that
excitement _ the reporter's excitement of `You may think you know
about this, but you don't' _ is what carried me through,'' Hare
said in a conversation at his New York pied-a-terre, a spacious
loft in the East Village.
</P>
<P>
   There is something suspect, albeit pleasing to a reporter's ear,
when the best-represented playwright on Broadway finds there are
themes that defy his art, subjects to which only journalism can do
justice. Yet anybody who has been in Israel knows it is a place
that wrenches the soul in a way fiction simply cannot.
</P>
<P>
   There is the overwhelming presence of religion, to which nobody
reacts in the same way. There are the conflicts, in which nobody
can remain neutral. There is the beauty, the sun, the desert, the
danger, and the extraordinary compactness of the place, which
prevent even momentary escape. This is stuff that begs to be told
as it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a feeling that I didn't want it to be, as it were,
conventional fiction,'' Hare said. ``And the minute I thought about
scenes of enactment, I became depressed because I knew that they
would be acted by English Jewish actors who would bear no
relationship to Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israelis are not, they really are not, like Jews who've been
living in North London for 30 years or 40 years. And the
Palestinians would have to be played by, you know, an Egyptian
actor, maybe a light-skinned Pakistani, maybe if we were lucky a
Lebanese, you know. And they would not be anything like the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if the more important the subject, the more
gratuitous the conventional approaches of fiction seem. And, you
know, in my view the greatest writer about the Holocaust was Primo
Levi. It's barely fiction at all. I don't mean there isn't art.
There is immense art, and there is immense imagination. But finally
Levi's claim to greatness is that you believe that it is true, and
that he's managed to encompass every aspect of it by the greatness
of his imagination. For what he's bringing you is something you
believe to be the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Hare first played with the idea of having a real Israeli and a
real Palestinian join him onstage to present their separate
versions of reality alongside his own. But then he realized that
even this attempt to reduce the story to its elemental components
would be a lie, because for a Palestinian writer even to step on
the same stage with an Israeli would be to imply a rapprochement
that does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Thus in the end Hare is alone on the stage of the Booth Theater,
in slacks and white shirt-sleeves, a somewhat awkward and slightly
bemused Briton talking about his visit to Israel. No plot, no
intermission, no actors, no dialogue, no costumes: nothing at all
between the storyteller and his audience except the footlights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pushing Broadway as far as it can be pushed,'' Hare said
with a dollop of pride. And it is a push that Lincoln Center
Theater, producer of the play, might not have risked with a lesser
playwright than Hare, who has had two other shows on Broadway this
season, ``Amy's View'' and ``The Blue Room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand before you as the reporter, and you have to decide
whether I'm an honest reporter or not,'' he said. ``And if you're
convinced that I am honest, then I think that you will listen to me
in a way that you wouldn't have listened to a fiction where scenes
are made. Does that make sense?''
</P>
<P>
   It does make sense to a reporter. But Israel arouses such
passions that simple honesty is not always enough to avoid
nastiness. There is a story Henry A. Kissinger tells about his
first meeting with Golda Meir, by then the former prime minister of
Israel, at which she told him that she expected the United States
to be evenhanded in the Middle East. ``She said that meant we had
to agree 100 percent with Israel,'' Kissinger continues. ``At the
time I thought she was kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   Hare was in Israel long enough to understand that, and one of
his more powerful passages is his meeting with American settlers in
the West Bank, to whom he assigns the names Danny and Sarah Weiss,
``whose American-type home is littered with Delta timetables and
yesterday's copy of The New York Times.'' It is here that Hare
comes face to face with the core of Jewish zealotry, the immutable
belief that the lands of Judaea and Samaria are the God-given
property of the Jews, and only the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few places where my antagonisms or my sympathies
show, and plainly the settlers were, for me, a disturbing people to
meet, because to live as they seemed to, or as they pretend to,
with no conception of the future, is a very peculiar way to live,''
Hare said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet like so many other outsiders who have listened to the
impassioned arguments of the settlers, he cannot dismiss them:
``One of the most powerful lines to me in the play is when Sarah
says, unless we stay here, we have no chance at all. I'm not just
talking about the Holocaust, but you will find in every moment in
Jewish history whenever there's a moment of safety, persecution
started again. And that is a very difficult argument to deal with,
isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Inescapably the play has had some minor disruptions during
performances _ walkouts, loud comments and the like _ but not on
the scale that Hare or the producers feared. He recalled a fax he
received from Salman Rushdie asking whether Hare really planned to
stage the play in New York. ``And he said this wonderful thing, he
said being a persecuted writer isn't all it's cracked up to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not frightened about scrutiny,'' Hare said. ``I've thought
quite long and hard about what I want to say in this play. And if
it means that every single sentiment that I produce is put minutely
under an ideological microscope, that's fine.''

A ROARING RETURN FOR KENNY BRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The third time proved to be the charm for Kenny
Brack.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Brack arrived from Sweden and had his debut in
the Indianapolis 500 ruined by a crash on the warmup lap that wiped
out him and the rest of the starters on the fifth row. Last year,
he returned as part of A.J. Foyt's stable and qualified fast enough
to join teammate Billy Boat, the pole-sitter, on the front row. He
led 23 laps, the third-best total in the race, but finished sixth
after running out of fuel on Lap 88 and barely making it back into
the pits.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Brack was the unwitting beneficiary of Robby Gordon's
fuel problems, as the CART driver ran out of gas with one lap to
go, delivering the 33-year-old native of Arvika, Sweden, his first
Indy 500 victory and Foyt, a four-time winner as a driver, his
first triumph as a car owner.
</P>
<P>
   Brack gained a greater appreciation for Foyt's four Indy 500
titles. ``It's very hard to win a race like this race, because
there are so many unknowns,'' he said. ``You don't know how the
car's going to handle, you don't know what's going to happen with
other drivers, if there's going to be lots of overtaking, and
there's so much risk involved that you have to calculate correctly
all the time. So you have to really have a lot of knowledge and so
forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this year we picked up a lot of good things. I've been
watching the videos, I've been taking notes and doing research for
two or three months and going through things just to know what I
could expect here. We planned for this, the team planned well, and
I think you get a little lucky _ if you prepare well.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day when a huge crowd turned out to bid farewell to Arie
Luyendyk, the 45-year-old pole-sitter whose 15th and final Indy 500
ended in a Turn 3 wall crash on Lap 117, the torch seemingly was
passed from the Flying Dutchman to Brack, who was described by
Michael Buffer during driver introductions as ``the Swede with the
need for speed.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Brack and runner-up Jeff Ward were the only
ones out of seven drivers who led at least a lap to make it to the
finish. Brack led four times for a total of 66 laps, the most of
any driver, while Ward led once for three laps before Brack's
daring Turn 1 pass on Lap 154.
</P>
<P>
   Brack adhered to his plan to play it cool, keep pace for the
first 100 laps, then give chase and go for it all in the last 10
laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't in a hurry all day,'' Foyt said. ``We were going to
run our own race. If we had to get reckless in the end, then we
would. I didn't want to take chances of eating our tires up. It was
just one of those days where everything worked in our favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially when the leaders pitted under caution with about 30
laps to go and Gordon stayed on the track to move up to the lead.
As Brack gave chase and Foyt kept a vigil in the pits, they knew
that Gordon's 35-gallon tank would run dry before he could take the
checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt Robby should have run out before he did,'' Foyt said.
``Last year we tried to stretch it and we got ourselves in trouble.
But I told Kenny I didn't want second.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt's wishes were granted when Gordon's car sputtered with one
lap to go.
</P>
<P>
   The result was one of the oddest of couples in Victory Circle:
Brack, the quiet, unassuming road racer from Sweden who watches his
diet as carefully as he measures his words; and Foyt, the sometimes
brusque but always outspoken car owner from Houston with a
voracious appetite for life and anything with a high caloric
content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody laughed when I brought a foreigner to America, but I
brought him to Texas (to live) and he's not too bad,'' Foyt said of
Brack, who won three races in a row last year to deliver his car
owner an Indy Racing League championship. ``He's a good racer.''
</P>
<P>
   While Foyt has a reputation for going through drivers at Indy
the way George Steinbrenner does managers at Yankee Stadium, Brack
has settled into an easy working relationship with Foyt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been good so far, no bad moments,'' Brack said. ``Sure,
A.J. calls a spade a spade. I'm not as outspoken as he is, but I
think I tell it like it is.''
</P>
<P>
   So whom was Brack happier for? Foyt, for winning his first as an
owner and fifth overall? Or himself, for winning his first?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy for both of us,'' Brack smiled. ``I think more for
me. He has won it four times already. So I am happier for myself.
It has been very special to me.''

   Energizers Motorsports chief mechanic Steve Fried, who was
critically injured when he was run over on pit row during the race,
remained in critical but stable condition in the intensive care
unit at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis. He was awake and
responding to those around him, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   Energizer team management has decided to have crews don helmets
at the next Indy Racing League event June 12 at Texas Motor

 &HT;    Spoleto's `Burgschaft' a dark masterpiece
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Kurt Weill was born in 1900 and died in 1950,
which makes next year both his centenary and the semicentennial of
his death. The Spoleto Festival got a jump on the double
anniversary by offering the U.S. premiere of his epic opera ``Die
Burgschaft'' (1932), which was banned by the Nazi government after
just three performances.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why. The opera is profoundly disturbing, as its
leftist composer intended. Sen. Joseph McCarthy, Pat Buchanan and
the House impeachment team also might be happy to shut it down.
</P>
<P>
   Conceived and directed by Jonathan Eaton of the University of
Cincinnati's College-Conserv-atory of Music, the production is
close to brilliant: brooding, violent, comfortless and not at all
to the taste of Spoleto's we're-here-to-play audiences. Designers
Danila Korogodsky (sets and costumes) and John McLain (lights) have
made a world in which nothing is finished: scaffolding and packing
boxes, faceless inmates in work-camp clothes, searchlights: the raw
materials of isolation, firing squads, gas chambers. We can see
Hitler coming, just as Weill could: A banner the width of the stage
screams ``FREI,'' but the rest of the word has been torn away
(Freiheit, meaning freedom).
</P>
<P>
   Having broken his partnership with the playwright Bertolt
Brecht, Weill in the early '30s was looking beyond the
cabaret-style satires (''The Threepenny Opera'') they had created.
In ``Die Burgschaft,'' he wrote a full-scale political allegory on
no less a subject than the disintegration of what John Locke called
the social compact between the individual and the community.
</P>
<P>
   Burgschaft may be translated as pledge or bond. But considering
the source of its story, I prefer its older meaning of covenant.
It's based on a parable from the Talmud (a collection of rabbinic
commentaries) as retold by the 18th-century German humanist Johann
Gottfried von Herder: a complex set of origins that shows Weill
thinking beyond the immediate troubles of Weimar Germany to the
greater (and recurring) ones of human civilization across history.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins simply enough, with David Orth, the grain
dealer in the mythical city of Urb, pledging his resources to the
creditors of his friend Johann Mattes, the cattle broker, who
doesn't know when to stop gambling. In this one-to-one transaction,
the bond of trust that cements both friendship and commerce holds.
</P>
<P>
   But when a totalitarian invader seizes Urb, trust is distorted
beyond recognition _ eventually, frayed beyond repair. Cold delight
in money-making for its own sake erodes the basic human contract;
Orth and Mattes find it all too easy to forget friendship and
family ties as they become war profiteers. At last not even the
business bond remains: With no more money to be made at the war's
end, Orth turns over his former friend to a lynch mob.
</P>
<P>
   The opera's music and its drama are at cross-purposes. As the
tale moves from the particular to the general, from individuals to
classes, the music becomes more potent and glorious: big blazing
choruses of passion and despair, outshouted by the orchestra at its
most apocalyptic. But the people get lost, and with them the opera.
If opera has a defining trait, it's the primacy of the individual;
once the group takes over, what we have is a combination of pageant
and oratorio.
</P>
<P>
   The Spoleto production (a copy of one that Eaton directed in
Bielefeld, Germany, in 1998) has an outstanding cast, led by
Frederick Burchinal as Mattes, Dale Travis as Orth, Margaret
Thompson as Mattes' wife and Katherine Ciesinski as the people's
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Musical forces are led by New York City Opera's Julius Rudel, a
long-standing champion of Weill. At 78, he has lost none of his
energy. He regards ``Die Burgschaft'' as a masterpiece, and he
proved it.

MANY ENTREPRENEURS ARE ON INTERNET AUCTIONS

   SOMERVILLE, Mass. _ The poster in the antique shop was more than
a century old. Produced for the Union Pacific Railroad, it
encouraged New Englanders to take scenic train trips across the
grand vistas of the western United States.
</P>
<P>
   To Shannon Aaron of South Boston, it was ideal eBay bait, the
sort of collectible that would surely find a buyer on the popular
Internet auction site. So Aaron paid $25 for it, and posted an
offer on eBay to sell his find to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, a railroad buff in Montana bought the poster for
$700, or 28 times what Aaron had paid. ``I had a collector who said
he'd been waiting all his life,'' Aaron says. ``It was the cap of
his collection.''
</P>
<P>
   A knack for making this kind of deal has changed Aaron's life.
He no longer edits a local antiques magazine or works in somebody
else's knickknack shop. Instead, he's found a career tracking down
valuable antiques and collectibles and reselling them on the
Internet's hottest auction site.
</P>
<P>
   And he's not alone. An industry of entrepreneurs has sprung up
around auction sites like eBay. The sites enable anyone to start an
Internet business in minutes and to sell goods around the world.
And as the most popular such site, eBay is a favorite storefront
for these independent business people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly growing, as more and more people find out how
easy it is,'' said Kevin Pursglove, an eBay spokesman. Pursglove
won't say how many people have turned eBay auctions into a
full-time job, but confirms that the number is ``significant.''
</P>
<P>
   So significant that eBay has set up a special Power Sellers
program for regulars who sell more than $2,000 of goods per month.
Power Sellers get a special logo attached to their eBay Web
auctions, to tell potential buyers that the seller is a
trustworthy, respected member of the eBay community. There are
other perks, too: Those who sell $25,000 a month or more are
assigned a personal eBay account specialist to provide technical
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron won't say how much he takes in as an eBay auctioneer,
except that it's a lot. ``I make more money than I've ever made at
any job I've ever had,'' he declares.
</P>
<P>
   The eBay site was created in 1995 by Pierre Omidyar to buy and
sell the Pez candy dispensers that his wife loved to collect. But
it rapidly expanded into an on-line auction house for all manner of
merchandise. For people looking to empty their attics, eBay can
provide a cheap and simple alternative to garage sales and
newspaper ads. Because it uses an auction format, sellers often get
exceptional prices for items they once thought of as little more
than junk.
</P>
<P>
   Profits for eBay come from listing and transaction fees charged
to the seller. The company earned $2.4 million last year, but its
market capitalization is a stunning $22 billion. That's why many
other firms are trying their hand at the Internet auction business.
The on-line bookstore Amazon.com Inc., for instance, is spending
millions to promote its new auction service. But for now, eBay is
far ahead of the pack, with about 8 million visitors every month.
</P>
<P>
   Many serious entrepreneurs try to peddle goods over the
Internet. But there's the challenge of learning how to design a Web
site, or the expense of hiring a professional to do the job.
Besides, with millions of Web pages on the Internet, it's difficult
to attract visitors to any one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Now many of these businesspeople are simply auctioning their
goods on eBay or one of its competitors. It's relatively easy to
post a description of the product, and even a photograph. And eBay
draws about 8 million visitors from around the world each month,
boosting the odds that the goods will sell. The seller can set a
minimum price, and if a bidding war breaks out, an item can end up
selling at a far higher price than it would at an ordinary Internet
storefront.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you need is two obsessed people,'' said Michael Agostino
of Quincy. The 32-year-old Web site designer supplements his income
by selling rare compact discs on eBay under the name
``thelimelight.''
</P>
<P>
   Agostino is astounded by the prices some music fans cheerfully
pay. ``I sold a Mariah Carey CD single for $120,'' he recalls. Then
there's Carmen Electra, Baywatch girl, former wife of basketball
star Dennis Rodman, and erstwhile singer. ``She actually recorded a
CD with Prince before her Baywatch days,'' says Agostino. ``I found
it in a used CD store for like two bucks and I sold it for 80
bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   The community of people making a living off sites like eBay
sites doesn't stop with auctioneers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   During the California gold rush, some people got rich selling
picks and shovels to miners. In the same spirit, some eBay
entrepreneurs specialize in selling products to professional
on-line auctioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Schlicht of San Mateo, Calif., has created a software
program called AuctionPoster that makes it easy to list dozens or
hundreds of items on eBay. The 27-year-old software engineer had
gotten into the eBay habit, auctioning about 10 items a week. Each
item required a separate posting on the eBay Web site, and Schlicht
found the process tedious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was taking me 20 minutes to post an auction on eBay for
something that's only going to sell for $10,'' he said. So Schlicht
wrote a program to automate the process. Then he realized he could
sell the software to other eBay regulars.
</P>
<P>
   AuctionPoster is a subscription service that costs $29.95 a year
for unlimited use. Schlicht also provides a Web-hosting service for
people who want to display pictures of their merchandise on the
eBay site.
</P>
<P>
   Schlicht says his earnings from AuctionPoster in the last two
months have outstripped his salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very close to doing it full time,'' he says. But Schlicht
clings to his day job, worried that eBay might eventually offer a
competing service that would reduce demand for his product.
</P>
<P>
   The on-line auctioneers are so far having only a slight effect
on traditional retailers of collectibles. Andy Papertsian, owner of
Bay State Coin Co. in Boston, says he's forced to sell coins,
trading cards, and other collectibles at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always hearing, `Well, I can get it cheaper on the
Internet,' '' says Papertsian. ``I'm being compared, not just to my
competitors on the street, but to some nebulous eBay in the sky.''

   &UR; LOOKING AT THE WHOLE EARTH AGAIN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This summer is the 30th anniversary of the moon walk, and is
also the 30th anniversary of the first man-made photograph of our
whole planet from space, as taken by an astronaut on  &LR; an &LR;  Apollo
mission. The photograph came to grace the cover of the Whole Earth
catalog, as a reflection of the vision of  &UR; Stewart Brand &LR; , who
created the catalog, and founded the WELL in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Brand recalled the other day that in 1966, to ``get people
going'' in favor of space travel, he'd given out buttons that said,
``Why haven't we seen a photograph of the whole Earth?''
</P>
<P>
   The classic shots taken three years later ``weren't photographs
taken by robots on a satellite,'' says Brand. ``They were taken by
homesick astronauts looking toward the Earth from the moon.'' The
change in people's perception of themselves in the cosmos was like
that ``when mirrors got really good,'' said Brand, ``when people
could really see themselves. ... We saw a planet, but we saw
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, after the image was used on the cover of Life
magazine and all sorts of ads, ``it just became the classic image
of the world. It became as strong as the mushroom cloud, and
eventually displaced it, as fear of Armageddon was replaced by a
sense of the wholesome Earth and the age of space travel. What's
interesting is that the same rockets that were going to deliver the
bombs were going to deliver us to space. One was a message of
destruction and the other was a message of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand has just published ``The Clock of the Long Now'' (Basic;
$22), which he says is about ``making a hasty world safe for haste
by tending to the slow things.''

   ``I love color,'' said  &UR; Louise Grunwald &LR; , who is described as a

</P>
<P>
   ``I never get tired of period rooms,'' antiques dealer
 &UR; Merrill Stenbeck  &LR; revealed, ``but I've never had the urge to sit
down and read a magazine in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Decorator  &UR; Mica Ertegun &LR;  took a harsh view of ``pretty ... not a
word that ranks high on my decorating list,'' she said. ``It equals
mediocrity.'' Magazine editor  &UR; Cristina Greeven &LR;  disagreed in the
strongest terms: ``I couldn't imagine sleeping in a bedroom that
wasn't pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, said Grunwald, ``A woman's decorator, like her
hairdresser, has always been her shrink.''

DECISION ON TRADEMARK RIGHTS FOR A RUM SPURS GLOBAL DISPUTE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANA RADELAT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cuba cannot sell rum in the United States, but an
American court ruling over Cuba's rights to the Havana Club
trademark has President Fidel Castro so mad he is threatening to
market his own brand of ``Coca-Cola.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not the only one fuming. So are executives at Pernod Ricard
SA, the French beverage giant that paid an estimated $50 million
six years ago to team up with Cuba to produce and export Havana
Club rum, the island's prize liquor. The European Union has taken
up Pernod Ricard's cause, and the prospect looms large that rum
will soon join bananas, airplane engine mufflers and
hormone-treated beef in the parade of trans-Atlantic trade
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, with the exception of Bacardi-Martini U.S.A., the U.S.
subsidiary of Bacardi Ltd., which contends that it holds the rights
to the Havana Club name, just about everyone seems unhappy with the
ruling. The ruling, in April, by Federal District Judge Shira A.
Scheindlin of Manhattan, denied trademark rights to Cuba's most
famous rum.
</P>
<P>
   Many American companies, fearful of losing their trademark
rights in Cuba, are lobbying for the repeal of the law on which the
ruling was based. Criticism of the legislation is even being heard
from some quarters in the U.S. Trade Representative's office, the
guardian of corporate America's global interests.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute revolves around a provision of last year's federal
omnibus spending bill known as Section 211. The provision was
sponsored by Florida's senators, Connie Mack, a Republican, and Bob
Graham, a Democrat, at the behest of Bacardi Ltd., which is based
in the Bahamas but has a big presence in southern Florida. It
prohibits American courts from upholding trademarks ``that were
used in connection with a business or with assets that were
confiscated'' by the Castro government, unless the original owner
``expressly consented.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacardi bought the rights to the Havana Club trademark from the
original owner, the Arechabala family, in 1997, after Pernod Ricard
and Cuba went to court to stop Bacardi's American unit from selling
rum under that label. Like the Bacardi family, the Arechabalas went
into exile after the Castro government nationalized the rum
industry in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Barcardis, the Arechabalas never went back into
the liquor business, and Pernod Ricard contends they thereby
abandoned their trademark rights. Presumably, the United States
agreed, because the Castro government legally registered the brand
at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office years ago. Today, Pernod
Ricard holds trademark rights to the name in 180 countries; the
only place they are contested is in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Scheindlin's decision provoked Castro to rail against
America's ``bald-faced violation of international law'' and to
threaten to end protection for hundreds of American trademarks
registered in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope no one complains if one day we begin to produce
Coca-Cola,'' Castro said in a speech in Havana in May. ``We might
be able to make it better,'' he added, ``and on the can we'll put:
Cuban Coca-Cola.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Michael Heltzer, government relations manager at the New
York-based International Trademark Association, said Castro's
comments caused concern among some of his American members. He said
his group had ``at no point indicated its support'' for Section
211.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce was more emphatic. It said it
wanted Section 211 stricken from the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should have been thought through a little more carefully,''
said John Howard, the chamber's director of policy and programs.
``Given its effects, it should be repealed.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Washington's longstanding embargo on trade with Cuba,
hundreds of American companies have registered their brand names in
Cuba, including McDonald's, Calvin Klein, Gillette, Sara Lee and
Pepsico. Many are members of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   While American companies are grumbling about Section 211, Pernod
Ricard is shouting. It has begun an energetic campaign to persuade
the 15-nation European Union to challenge the new trademark law at
the World Trade Organization, the international arbiter of trade
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Hebebrand, an official with the Washington trade
office of the European Commission, the executive branch of the
European Union, said the commission would ``probably go ahead''
with the dispute-resolution process. European officials are
especially galled because they recently dropped a complaint against
another American law, the Helms-Burton Act, a 1996 measure aimed at
punishing foreign investors in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The matter has come up at every high-level meeting we've had
with the administration,'' Ms. Hebebrand said. ``The idea now is to
put some pressure on the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative, has
refrained from commenting on the issue, and a spokeswoman for her
office would only say that it was ``under review by an interagency
team.'' But a memo written to Ms. Barshefsky by three members of
her staff shortly after Section 211 became law concluded that ``its
language is problematic because it violates'' America's
international trade obligations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For all the clamor against it, the law has one powerful
defender: Bacardi, the world's largest rum producer. Jorge
Rodriguez, a spokesman for Bacardi, said the measure was not a
violation of international law and defended Judge Scheindlin's
ruling. He said Bacardi had entered into an agreement with the
Arechabalas, the original owner of the Havana Club name, because it
wanted to help an old competitor who was ``wiped out since they
were confiscated in 1960. We also liked the brand,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The rum war did not begin until 1993, after the collapse of the
Soviet bloc forced Cuba to look for Western investors and Pernod
Ricard entered the stage. After the French company and Cuba formed
their joint venture, Havana Club Holdings International, global
sales of Havana Club quickly soared to more than 1 million cases a
year from fewer than 400,000 cases.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Bacardi began producing its own Havana Club brand in
the Bahamas, though in tiny quantities. It halted production after
Havana Club Holdings filed suit, contesting Bacardi's right to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Pernod Ricard is appealing Judge Scheindlin's ruling, arguing
that the new American law is both illegal and unfair. ``It is
exactly as if at the end of a soccer game the referee says, `Okay,
guys, I'm sorry, but the rules of this game changed while you were
playing,''' said Pierre-Marie Chateauneuf, Pernod Ricard's general
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Bacardi says it will seek registration of its Havana
Club brand at the Patent and Trademark Office and will restart
production of the rum ``as soon as logistically possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lynne Beresford, a lawyer at the trademark office, said
Bacardi faced regulatory as well as legal obstacles. Her agency
cannot register a trademark that has a ``false designation of
origin,'' she noted, and Bacardi's Havana Club, which in addition
to its name has a picture of Havana's famed sea wall, or El
Malecon, on the label, may be considered an attempt to mislead
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We normally would refuse registration for an entity that is
geographically misdescriptive,'' Ms. Beresford said.

SCIENTISTS REPORT A NEW CATEGORY OF STAR

   CHICAGO _ Ambitious new surveys of the sky are surprising
astronomers with mystifying discoveries in recent weeks, including
an entirely new and cosmic category of numerous dim, reddish
objects that scientists are calling methane brown dwarfs.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the first observations by the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey, a project to map a broad swath of the heavens, astronomers
detected dots of light from two unusual objects. Each was smaller
than a star and larger than a planet. Their atmospheres were rich
in methane. And they were on their own, far from any neighboring
star.
</P>
<P>
   The two objects were not like any previously observed brown
dwarfs, the so-called failed stars that had long been theorized but
were not observed until 1995. Brown dwarfs have too little mass to
generate the nuclear fusion to shine like other stars and yet too
massive and hot to be a planet. The only other such object with
traces of methane, known as Gliese 229B, was detected orbiting a
normal star.
</P>
<P>
   Another team of astronomers, using near-infrared telescopes,
also reported finding four similar objects that were too cool to be
seen in visible light. They bore the methane fingerprint of
extremely cool brown dwarfs.
</P>
<P>
   The discoveries, announced here Monday at a meeting of the
American Astronomical Society, were described as strong evidence
that the faint brown dwarfs, though elusive, may represent a
significant population of the universe. Astronomers speculated that
these objects may well be as numerous as the stars.
</P>
<P>
   The first observations of the new methane brown dwarfs were made
this spring by astronomers at Princeton University, using the Sloan
Survey's new telescope at Apache Point, N.M. Dr. Michael Strauss
and a graduate student, Xiaohui Fan, were searching for objects of
unusual color.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object we observed was the reddest object we have found
thus far in 400 square degrees of observing,'' Strauss said.
</P>
<P>
   Then astronomers using the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope in
Hawaii took a look and analyzed the object's light for clues to its
chemical composition. Seeing evidence of water vapor and methane,
they concluded that the new object was an almost exact twin of
Gliese 229B. It was a brown dwarf, but was not associated with a
star companion. The object is about 30 light years away in the
constellation Ophiuchus.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, other Sloan observers, led by Dr. David
Golimowski of Johns Hopkins University, found another such object
and it, too, had methane. That object was also relatively nearby,
in the constellation Virgo.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday, Golimowski said the new objects
were probably older brown dwarfs that had cooled over billions of
years. The presence of methane would not have been possible in
hotter, younger objects. An estimate of their mass has yet to be
determined, but brown dwarfs are thought to have between 10 and 80
times the mass of Jupiter. If the object were any larger, it would
be big enough and hot enough to generate the nuclear reactions that
make stars shine.
</P>
<P>
   The first regular brown dwarf was detected by Dr. Gibor Basri,
an astronomer at the University of California at Berkeley. He said
the new discoveries were especially significant because, if the
galaxy has been producing brown dwarfs for the last 10 billion
years, most of them should by now be old, cool objects like the
newly found objects. Though they are hard to find, the universe may
be thick with these dim methane dwarfs.
</P>
<P>
   The detection of four other such objects was made in a separate
report by scientists at the California Institute of Technology and
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, both in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think these brown dwarfs are only 30 light years away,''
said Dr. Davy Kirkpatrick of Caltech. ``Because our telescopes can
only see the closest examples, this means the Milky Way must be
brimming with objects like these.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Geballe of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii, who
analyzed the light from some of the new objects, said that
``methane dwarf'' is the name being applied to distinguish them
from the more familiar kind of brown dwarfs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Methane is characteristic of giant planets, like Jupiter,'' he
said. ``But it never appears in normal stars _ they are too hot _
or even in most brown dwarfs.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, another group of astronomers reported
detecting an even more puzzling object, whose light appears to be
unlike anything seen before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have combed the literature and asked all kinds of experts,
but no one can tell us what it is,'' said Dr. S. George Djorgovski,
an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology and member
of a team conducting another sky survey at Palomar Observatory in
Southern California. ``It is the first one of something new, and a
complete mystery to us.''  &QL;

   Newspaperman Philip True, an American based out of Mexico City,
made a one-way trek into Mexico's last great wilderness last
December, fascinated by the unspoiled land of the Sierra Madre
Occidental and the intact culture of the Huichol Indians. Two weeks
later he turned up in a shallow grave. Atlanta writer Paul Kvinta
retraces True's journey for Outside ($3.95) and discovers that True
may have been blind to one important fact: This was a culture that
did not want to be discovered.

<P>
   EYE OF RAGE: Images can hasten war, Charles Paul Freund points
out in Reason ($2.95), discussing the role that broadcasts of
atrocities have played in American humanitarian expeditions in
Somalia, Haiti and, today, in Kosovo. Freund argues that what
starts out as a mission of mercy inevitably brings political
entanglements, and opines that ``when we do choose to act, it
should be in full appreciation not only of mercy's limits but of
its consequences.''

   LEARNING PEACE: A violence-prevention program called Second Step
that is taught in Decatur, Ga. schools and in Forsyth County, Ga.'s
Midway Elementary School receives attention from Life ($3.99) as a
viable way to silence the gunfire disrupting American schools.
Kennedy Middle School in Eugene, Ore., experienced a shooting last
year, and Second Step has reduced the number of Kennedy students
getting into trouble because of aggression and hostility, Life

   GOT MILK? Swedish researcher Catharina Svanborg set out to
determine why breast milk is so effective at warding off bacteria.
But when she started mixing breast milk with cancer cells seven
years ago, she saw the cancer cells falling apart _ in her words,
``committing suicide.'' Breast-fed babies are nine times less
likely to develop childhood lymphoma than bottle-fed babies, and
Svanborg thought she might have found out why. More than that, she
imagined isolating the compound in breast milk that kills cancer
cells and creating an across-the-board antidote. Discover ($4.99)
reports on her mom-and-pop research center in Lund, Sweden, and her
search for the grand cure.

 BEIJING: in Beijing.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The human rights group plans to release further details on
Tuesday at a news conference in New York.
</P>
<P>
   As corroborating evidence in their appeal, the relatives' group
provided names and details of 155 people who were killed and 65
people who were wounded in the attacks by the army and the police
on June 3 and 4, 1989. ``Not one was engaged in any violent
behavior,'' the group says of those listed. ``They were all
innocent victims of the massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of people who died in the crackdown has never been
disclosed, but it is believed to total several hundred at least.
The new list of victims, though far from complete, is the longest
ever publicly compiled.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party has firmly refused to reconsider its verdict
that the raucous 1989 demonstrations, in which hundreds of
thousands of students and other citizens marched or camped on
Beijing's central square, were a ``counter-revolutionary'' movement
that had to be crushed for the sake of China's stability and
development.
</P>
<P>
   Li, the central target of the new petitions, appears to be
securely in power today, a key spokesman for more conservative
elements in the Communist Party. The group's decision to cite Li
and other living officials as targets for criminal indictment
assures a hostile reaction from the Communist Party and the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Western and Chinese experts believe that the final decision to
use military force to clear students from Tiananmen Square was made
by Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader who died in 1997, and that
the military operations were directed by Yang Shangkun, who died
last September.
</P>
<P>
   But the new petitions say Li, as premier, bore major
responsibility for the killings because of his role in declaring
martial law, because he ``failed to stop the cruel killings of
civilians,'' and because he ``tried to cover up these crimes,''
praising the army for its achievements in the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the attacks on unarmed civilians ``systematic and
organized,'' the petitions say several military leaders should be
held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   The first petition calling for a criminal inquiry was delivered
on May 17 by Zhang Xianling, 62 and Su Bingxian, 64, both mothers
of young men shot dead on June 4, 1989. They took the petition to
the front gate of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the agency
that prosecutes crimes. Eventually an official emerged and took the
document, they reported, promising an answer that has not come.
</P>
<P>
   On May 24, the same two women delivered a second document
providing more details of the group's demands to guards at that
same gate.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone Monday, officials in the information
section of the Supreme Procuratorate said they had no knowledge of
the petitions and could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ding and other organizers of the victims' group know that
they are pushing the authorities to the limit, risking arrest and
prison. Working with exiled dissidents against the interests of the
Communist Party is often declared a major crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since my son died in 1989, there's nothing more that can scare
me,'' Ms. Ding said Monday. ``I do what I choose to do according to
my own conscience.''

 &HT;    Rescue attempt in suburban Atlanta turns tragic
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ None of Thomas Robinson's grieving relatives expressed
surprise Monday that ``Cowboy'' gave his life trying to save a man
whose canoe had capsized in Joel's Lake near Lithonia, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   They said the 39-year-old Robinson, who drowned trying to swim
back to shore Sunday night, helped anyone at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always did stuff like that,'' his sister-in-law, Carlotta
Harrell, said. ``He'd help out folks he didn't know. He'd give away
his last dime. He'd find jobs for people who needed one.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson died trying to save the life of Dwayne Evans, 33, who
also drowned. Police say Evans was fishing with two other men on
Sunday. According to the DeKalb police report, Evans was playing
around in the boat and it flipped over. None of the three men were
wearing life jackets, Fire Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a father of four, was a former deputy nicknamed
``Cowboy'' because he loved horses. A former rodeo rider, Robinson
owned several horses.
</P>
<P>
   He founded one of Atlanta's first horse-drawn carriage
companies, which caters to tourists downtown. He also loved driving
his Harley-Davidson and was a member of a local motorcycle club.
</P>
<P>
   About 7:30 p.m. Sunday, Robinson was out in the yard when a man
came running up from the lake, saying a canoe with three fishermen
had capsized. Robinson immediately called his wife, Kenya, on the
couple's two-way radio and told her to dial 911. Robinson then
sprinted down to Joel's Lake.
</P>
<P>
   At the lake, Robinson dove in to try and save Evans, Harrell
said.
</P>
<P>
   As Kenya Robinson waited for fire and police personnel to arrive
at the house, her husband called back on the two-way radio, asking
her to bring him some dry clothes and some towels.
</P>
<P>
   When she asked if he had been able to save the third man,
Robinson said, ``No, I'm not a lifeguard,'' said Robinson's
mother-in-law, Brenda Harris, who heard the call. She added:
``Those were the last words we heard him say.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson apparently dove back in the lake one last time but
never made it back to shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave up his life trying to save someone else,'' Harris
said. ``It doesn't surprise me whatsoever. ... But he was the sole
bread-winner for his wife and four children. We've just got to
figure out what to do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Divers found Robinson's body 50 to 75 feet from shore at about 9
p.m. Sunday and pulled Evans' body from the lake about 11 a.m.
Monday, DeKalb Fire Battalion Chief Bobby Wade said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrell, Robinson's sister-in-law, criticized DeKalb County
police and fire officials for not immediately jumping in to try and
save Robinson when they arrived at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   But Wade said DeKalb Fire officials did not want another
fatality. ``If we had jumped in, one of us might have ended up just
like Mr. Robinson,'' Wade said.
</P>
<P>
   One firefighter saw Robinson struggling in the water and threw a
fire hose toward him, but Robinson was unable to reach it, Wade
said.

AGGRAVATION BOILS OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The day had already turned sour on the Detroit Tigers
when relief pitcher Matt Anderson threw his last pitch of what was
for him a long afternoon in a short time span.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Anderson and the Tigers, the pitch plunked Red
Sox first baseman Mike Stanley just below the shoulder blade.
</P>
<P>
   Home plate umpire Chuck Meriwether took about a second to
determine that the pitch, which came on a 3-and-2 count, had been
intentionally thrown at Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was gone, and the ejection set off Tiger catcher Brad
Ausmus, who went from disbelief to rage in a heartbeat, and that
set off Tiger manager Larry Parrish, who sprinted onto the field in
a futile effort to protect his catcher from being tossed.
</P>
<P>
   But all Parrish could do was voice his own outrage and disbelief
at something that enraged the Tigers as much as turning a 6-1 lead
into an 8-7 loss did.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, of all,'' Parrish said, ``to think that he was throwing
at anybody with a 3-and-2 count is ridiculous. The way he was
pitching, he couldn't have hit anybody if he wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson faced four batters, allowing a two-run pinch-hit home
run to Jason Varitek, a single to Nomar Garciaparra, and a two-run
home run to Troy O'Leary before plunking Stanley, so he no doubt
would have been gone anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the way he departed that angered the Tigers. Adding
to their frustration was that Meriwether was behind the plate nine
days ago when Detroit and Cleveland got into a ``beanball'' war
that led to ejections and suspensions. Those things can be
particularly frustrating for a team playing as poorly as the
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Making things worse was watching Red Sox closer Tom Gordon nick
Damion Easley with a pitch in the top of the ninth without any
action from Meriwether.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be consistent,'' said Ausmus, who conceded that he
deserved to be tossed for his reaction. ``If they can come out and
warn him before the ninth, and then he hits Damion Easley with
nothing happening is embarrassing for the umpires. Especially when
a week ago the same crew is working the Cleveland series and C.J.
Nitkowski was suspended and thrown out for two games and didn't hit
a guy. There's no consistency. There's no question in my mind that
Tom Gordon was not trying to hit Damion Easley, but he should have
been thrown out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ausmus also conceded that he was not in the best of moods even
before Stanley was hit. Watching his team blow another lead, on a
91-degree Monday afternoon, contributed to his irritation.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I was just flabbergasted they would throw Matt
Anderson out,'' said Ausmus. ``But then the first words out of my
mouth were the kind you couldn't play on television before 11:30 at
night and probably after it as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck generally does a good job. He works his ass off. Today
he mad a bad decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Tigers sat around after the game and watched a
replay of Anderson hitting Stanley. Some suggested that Meriwether
actually bumped Parrish in their face-to-face confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was trying to hit anybody,'' said Parrish. ``But if you
are consistent, Tom Gordon deserved to be thrown out as well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just an aggravating day,'' summed up Ausmus.

MIDLIFE HITS LINCOLN CENTER WITH CALLS FOR A FACE LIFT

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Across Lincoln Center's 18-acre expanse, granite
paving blocks are spider-veined with cracks. Missing tiles mar the
reflecting pool that frames Henry Moore's signature sculpture. An
uncomfortable crush of patrons often jams the undersize lobby of
the Metropolitan Opera House, and its metal ceiling is turning
green from oxidation. Calls for sweeping renovations of Avery
Fisher Hall and the New York State Theater are growing more
insistent.
</P>
<P>
   As it celebrates its 40th birthday, Lincoln Center for the
Performing Arts, the world's most successful arts complex, is
showing its age. Officials are weighing a vast fund-raising
campaign to address the wear and tear and other gnawing problems,
from shortages of backstage space to troubled acoustics to
underground leaks.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars,
making it the largest arts initiative in the city in years.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys of the needs of the Metropolitan Opera House and of
Avery Fisher Hall, home of the New York Philharmonic, indicated
that renovating those two buildings could cost more than half a
billion dollars. A committee led by Roy Furman, vice chairman of
the center's board of directors, has been asked for a report by
this fall on capital needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this effort is going to be looking at things 40 years
old whose useful life has run out and need to be replaced,'' said
Nathan Leventhal, the president of Lincoln Center since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Coming four decades after Lincoln Center's groundbreaking in May
1959, the internal review is described by officials as a midlife
stock-taking, a way to figure out what it would take to bring the
complex's performance halls up to 21st-century standards and to
keep enticing audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues Lincoln Center faces is how to mount a major
new capital drive without interfering with the fund raising of its
constituents, from the Metropolitan Opera, halfway through a $200
million drive to double its endowment, to Jazz at Lincoln Center,
which is pressing to raise about $70 million for its first
performance hall.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the thinking is expansive. One member of the
Philharmonic's board, Rita E. Hauser, suggested rebuilding almost
every performance hall. ``They all served a wonderful purpose,''
she said. ``But if I had my druthers, other than the Met, I'd take
them down.''
</P>
<P>
   The buildings are not under landmark protection, but because
they were part of a federally aided urban renewal project, any
changes to their exterior would face government and community
review.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by a coalition of esteemed architects, Lincoln Center's
melange of arched facades, clad in luminescent but vulnerable
travertine, bears the scars of patchwork repairs and deterioration.
(Kimball J. Beasley, an engineer at Wiss Janney Elstner Associates,
said that travertine, a type of limestone, was particularly
susceptible to pollution.)
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, the center has spent nearly $25 million on
repairs and maintenance, not including such capital projects as the
continuing $30 million reconstruction of the performing arts
library. Its endowment is $142 million. For all this, said Joseph
Volpe, the Met's general manager, ``The condition of the plaza is a
disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Met, the Philharmonic and Jazz at Lincoln Center,
the 13 constituents of the center are the New York Library for the
Performing Arts; the School of American Ballet; the New York City
Ballet; the New York City Opera; the City Center of Music and
Drama; the Juilliard School; the Film Society of Lincoln Center
(which runs the New York Film Festival); the Chamber Music Society
of Lincoln Center, and the Lincoln Center Theater. The constituents
include Lincoln Center itself which, in addition to managing the
complex, presents 350 events a year, from the Mostly Mozart
festival and Great Performers to the Lincoln Center Festival in the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   An Avery Fisher study, sponsored by the Philharmonic and the
center, has not been publicly released. But executives familiar
with the report said it recommended three options: upgrade the hall
with a largely cosmetic face lift ($20 million); overhaul it in a
major modernization ($100 million), or recreate it in an expansive,
innovative way, including a new stage and sound system ($200
million). The hall, which had acoustic problems that were addressed
by a $30 million effort in the 1970s, is still dealing with cramped
concourses and a poor restaurant layout.
</P>
<P>
   At the New York State Theater, Martin J. Oppenheimer, who is the
board chairman, said that the house, built for ballet, has
shortcomings for its opera component: ``Is it adequate for opera?
Yes. Have we made improvements? Yes. Do we hope for something even
better? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The theater, executives said, lacked adequate space for
workshops and rehearsals, for storage of sets backstage and for
cooking food to serve at receptions; caterers must carry the food
across the plaza from Avery Fisher Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Bourscheidt, the master plan coordinator for the State
Theater, said that a minimal upgrading of the facade and windows
had been estimated at $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Opera is in far better physical shape. For its
silver anniversary at Lincoln Center in 1990, the Met undertook 82
capital projects totaling about $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said James H. Naples Jr., the house manager, a crush of
patrons was often a problem in the lobby because the design was
shortened by 40 feet to save money. As with other buildings at
Lincoln Center, the Met's travertine facade shows its patches.
</P>
<P>
   Since completion of the initial Lincoln Center plan in 1969, at
a cost of $184 million, the biggest project has been the $180
million construction, from 1988 to 1992, of the Samuel B. and David
Rose Building and the Walter Reade Theater, along with additions to
Juilliard.
</P>
<P>
   Many within the complex consider the prospective effort of a
piece with the master plan laid out more than 40 years ago by John
D. Rockefeller III, who led the campaign for the center. ``We are
not building for just '56 or '57 or '58,'' he said. ``We are
thinking of something that will last for generations.''

BIZARRO BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The full moon was Sunday night, but the real lunacy
didn't take place until Monday afternoon at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   It will go down as a nifty, come-from-behind, 8-7 victory over
the Detroit Tigers, making the Red Sox 20-8 for the month of May
and inflating their giddy, first-place lead over the Yankees to 1
1/2 games.
</P>
<P>
   But it was so much more. This was was ``Pulp Fiction'' meets
``Bull Durham,'' one of the nuttiest and most entertaining games of
this or any season. It was Bizarro Baseball, a Holiday Festival
that included 10 pitchers, six homers, four hit batsmen, three
ejections, one subluxation (Mark Portugal's shoulder), and one
cleaned-out locker _ from a guy on the winning side.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. It might not rank up there with the
locker-emptying of Roger Clemens and Mike Greenwell in the final
week of the 1996 season, but Portugal, the Sox starter, packed his
stuff and loaded his car after giving up six runs in three innings.
Boston manager Jimy Williams said he expects Portugal back on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was the perfect guy to encapsulate the events of the
final day of May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange game,'' said the manager. ``A day game, but I was
looking for that moon. I don't know what was happening but there
were some strange things.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange indeed. Most peculiar.
</P>
<P>
   It started with Luis Polonia's big-league popup that Nomar
Garciaparra lost in the sun. The ball landed for a two-base hit
(originally scored an error, but changed after the game, adding two
more runs to Portugal's ERA). That set the tone.
</P>
<P>
   After Polonia's 120-foot double, Tigers second baseman Damion
Easley was hit for the first of three times. Actually, he was
grazed three times.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox got one back in the first (Nomar's 33d RBI of the
month), but Detroit struck quickly in the second. Gabe ``We Tease
Him A Lot, 'Cause We Got Him On The Spot'' Kapler started the
three-run rally with a Bucky Dent-type homer into the net.
</P>
<P>
   With one on and one out, Deivi Cruz hit a one-hopper back to
Portugal and the righty strained himself when he leaped and gloved
the ball. His left shoulder popped out of its socket
(``subluxation'') and it looked as though Portugal's body was being
invaded by Joe Cocker. Call Ghostbusters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt me, just watching,'' said Williams. ``I guess it
went out of its socket.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal hung around for three full innings, then left trailing,
6-1. While the Sox came back with a barrage of homers, the veteran
righty did some packing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in to get a bat and he was packing a bag,'' said Mike
Stanley. ``I guess he has some serious decisions to make in the
next 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston trailed, 6-4, in the seventh when things really got
interesting. With one on and one out, Tigers manager Larry Parrish
summoned rocket reliever Matt Anderson. The righty has been clocked
at 103 miles per hour, which is the approximate speed at which
Jason Varitek's game-tying, two-run, pinch homer left the yard.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit flamethrower wasn't done. He immediately surrendered
a single to Garciaparra, then Troy O'Leary conked a 318-foot
pop-fly homer just inside the left-field foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley was next, and on a 3-and-2 pitch, Anderson drilled the
first baseman with a 99-mile-per-hour fastball. The pitch hit
Stanley above the left elbow and prompted Anderson's immediate
ejection by plate umpire Chuck Meriwether (he and the Tigers have
some history).
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Brad Ausmus was incensed and got himself tossed before
behemoth Parrish could reach Meriwether for his own pink slip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Matty's throwing, he couldn't hit him if he threw at
him,'' reasoned Parrish.
</P>
<P>
   From that point, the game moved to its inevitable conclusion.
The indomitable Tom Gordon came on to record his 54th consecutive
regular-season save. Imagine making The New York Times Bestseller
List (Stephen King's ``The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon'') and winning
the Rolaids Relief Award in the same calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   Given their first-place status and the nature of this thrilling
comeback, one would have expected euphoria in the Sox clubhouse,
but the mood was somewhat muted by Portugal. He met with Williams
briefly, then brushed past a group of writers without commenting.
His locker was nearly empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a little down,'' said Williams. ``It's a personal
situation. We'll just try to keep it in our clubhouse. I appreciate
his privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Williams think Portugal will report for work Tuesday?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll be here,'' said the manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I've never seen that before,'' said Sox pitching
coach Joe Kerrigan. ``When I was with the Orioles, Jim Palmer did
it once a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal hasn't won since May 9 and his ERA is 5.00.
</P>
<P>
   If Portugal goes AWOL it would not be the first time a Sox
pitcher bolted in the middle of a season. Bill Lee took a hike
after the Sox traded his pal, Bernie Carbo, in 1978 and tall righty
Gene Conley tried to fly to Israel after a frustrating loss in
Yankee Stadium in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   God bless the Red Sox. In bad times and in good, they are always
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   We can't wait for June.

HOW BAD DO THINGS HAVE TO GET?

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The letter from the woman began, ``Two and one-half
years ago, my formally considerate, loving, obedient 15-year-old
son walked in the door and informed me that he didn't have to do
anything I said anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   She was determined to prove him wrong.
</P>
<P>
   She sought help from family, friends, counselors, the police,
the juvenile probation department, the courts. She's seen her son
arrested, hauled before judges, ordered to perform community
service, placed on probation and on house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   She's watched him ignore it all, and her, with no real
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never would have believed it,'' she said last week. ``But
now, after all this time, I realize that when he came into the
house that day and said he didn't have to listen to me anymore, or
to anyone else, he was right.''
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking about a gang-banger. Her son hasn't robbed a
convenience store or assaulted a police officer or organized a
major drug ring. It would be easier if he had. Those kids we know
how to deal with. We treat them as adults and put them away.
</P>
<P>
   We identify them in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   But not this kid. His mother, Cindi, won't have a last name in
this article, and the boy won't be named at all because, as yet,
his crimes don't warrant it.
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem. &QL; 
Learning lessons &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the two years he's been acting out this way,'' Cindi
says, ``he's learned that he can disregard the rules and defy
authority. And get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been involved in vandalism, shoplifting, loitering, curfew
violations and drug use. The juvenile courts have placed him on
probation and house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ignores it, or gets around it,'' Cindi said. ``And when I
turn him in, the probation people get annoyed and say, `Let us do
our job.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her son's been ordered to perform community service, and hasn't.
He does what he wants.
</P>
<P>
   His parents are divorced. He's gone to live with his father and
with other relatives. It never lasts long.
</P>
<P>
   ``He eventually acts with them as he does with me,'' Cindi said.
``And they throw him out.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's juvenile probation department knows all about the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Townsend, director of Juvenile Court Services, said,
``He's done things and been faced with increasing consequences. We
don't believe we're letting him skate. I know, by now, the mom
would probably like for him to be detained. The reality is that our
detention centers are very overcrowded.'' &QL; 
No room in jails &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We don't have room for all our violent juvenile offenders, let
alone for kids like Cindi's son. It leaves a struggling mother with
few options. She doesn't have the money to send her boy to one of
those tough-love wilderness experiences, or any other expensive
private program. He wouldn't agree to go, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society hasn't figured out what to do with him,'' she said.
``He's not bad enough yet, I guess. So, instead of preventing him
from becoming that bad, we choose to just wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Townsend says prevention programs work, but need to be
expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just kids who need help, these days,'' she says.
``It's families. We need more resources to help families deal with
these types of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, if Cindi's boy kills someone in a car accident
or a fight, it'll be Cindi we blame. Blaming parents is a national
pastime. It's easy. It requires little thought, and even less
money.
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Townsend believes this particular boy still can be
helped. He has another probation violation hearing this week. Maybe
something productive will come of it, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Cindi isn't as optimistic. Her boy turns 18 in less than six
months, and will either move out or be asked by his mother to
leave. It's something she wants us to think about because she
figures there are a lot of kids like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no respect for the law,'' she said. And no sense of
responsibility. And no fear of reprisal. And he's about to become
an adult. &QL;

Metreon, which opens in San Francisco next month, is being billed
as a cross between a high-tech shopping mall and a theme park. But
it's also a four-story, 350,000-square-foot marketing vehicle for
Sony Corp.
<P>
   Almost every square foot of Metreon promotes the Tokyo company's
far-flung holdings _ from its music-recording arm, which includes
the Epic label, to its film studio, Columbia TriStar Motion Picture
Group, to its computer games, high-definition televisions and
boom-boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy works on many levels: Sony will sell consumer
products in the high-profile PlayStation and Sony Style stores.
Behind the scenes, it will showcase business technologies _ such as
a DJ sound system in Jillian's restaurant that Sony hopes to sell
to nightclub developers and other corporate clients. Throughout the
complex, Sony hopes to build its image as a cool, cutting-edge
company.
</P>
<P>
   If the experiment works, observers say, Metreon could be as
effective a branding vehicle for Sony as Disney World is for Walt
Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Sony plans to roll out other Metreons around the world if this
one proves successful.
</P>
<P>
   If Metreon fails, Sony will have bungled an $85 million
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A virtual showroom for Sony makes tremendous sense,'' said
Mike Moriarty, an entertainment-retail consultant with A.T. Kearney
in Chicago. ``If they want to keep their leading-edge image, they
have to maintain a leading-edge position in new technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Metreon's blatant brand-marketing elements include 15 Sony
cinemas, some of which will &LR;   &LR; show Columbia TriStar pictures, and a
huge Sony IMAX theater for 3-D movies.
</P>
<P>
   But most of Sony's salesmanship is understated.
</P>
<P>
   Sony recordings will be played as background music throughout
the mall. The PCs running Microsoft software in the Microsoft store
will carry little Sony tags, as will the headphones in Hear Music's
listening stations.
</P>
<P>
   Sony technology is behind the 110-foot video wall in the
Discovery Channel Store, Melvin the talking robot in an educational
attraction called Why Things Work, and the computer server that
lets Hear Music patrons listen to thousands of CDs.
</P>
<P>
   A Metreon debit card that visitors can use instead of cash was
developed by Sony. Games in a futuristic arcade called the Airtight
Garage were created by Sony. Even leftover Sony computer parts have
become a design element _ tiny chips and other computer innards are
pressed into Metreon's concrete walls.
</P>
<P>
   Metreon will even showcase a technology that is still on the
drawing board: decorative, 12-foot ``wings'' floating above the
lobby will one day be outfitted with thin HDTV screens, although
Sony is still trying to figure out how to make monitors that are
long and thin enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to expand the definition of entertainment,'' said
Tom Sugiyama, general manager of Sony's location-based
entertainment division. ``We're taking advantage of our hardware
and also taking advantage of our content, like movies, games and
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony's goals are twofold: to strengthen the Sony image as ``a
company that offers a new kind of lifestyle'' and ``to make money
by merging these kinds of entertainment'' into a profitable
shopping center, said Sugiyama.
</P>
<P>
   But will a visit to Metreon really influence a visitor's buying
decision months later, when he or she is shopping for a boom box in
Walnut Creek or Topeka, Kansas? That's something nobody knows for
certain, including Sony officials, Sugiyama admits.
</P>
<P>
   For Metreon to be an effective brand-builder, the Sony name must
be reasonably conspicuous, said Moriarty. If visitors skip the
cinemas and PlayStation and Sony Style stores, they could miss the
Sony connection.
</P>
<P>
   Company decision-makers opted not to call the center Sony
Metreon because they didn't want visitors to arrive with
preconceived ideas, said Sugiyama. Yet consumers are unlikely to
use it's official name, ``Metreon, a Sony Entertainment Center.''
So the Sony name could get lost.
</P>
<P>
   The name issue aside, consultant Pat Esgate said Metreon seems
unique and cool enough to burnish Sony's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe (Metreon visitors) will be more likely to buy Sony
products, just as I'm sure there's an impact when people go to
FootLocker after they've visited NikeTown,'' said Esgate, who runs
Esgate &AMP; Associates in Nyack, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   There are two requirements for retail entertainment venues like
Metreon to be a success, said Moriarty: ``continuously refreshable
content and continually refreshable consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   If Metreon succeeds in attracting 2.5 million out-of-town
tourists per year _ half of its projected annual traffic of 5
million _ the ``refreshable consumers'' should be taken care of.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Swinney, president of Sony Development, said merchandise
selections at Sony Style and other stores will be frequently
refreshed. Same with the games in Airtight Garage and the exhibits
in the Way Things Work, a multimedia attraction that uses gears and
levers to teach children (and their parents) about physics and
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the applications developed for Metreon, such as the
debit card and arcade games, were not designed for resale to other
companies, although they may be used in future Metreons. Their
function is to make Metreon a fun and unique experience that
shoppers associate with the Sony name.
</P>
<P>
   But other Sony technologies used in Metreon are intended to make
money through sales to other businesses. Even before the doors open
June 16, Sony will have sold $10 million of its own electronic
components, like video monitors and projectors, for use in the
center, said Swinney.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sony developed a server with San Francisco music
retailer Hear Music that will let patrons listen to thousands of
CDs at listening stations around the store.
</P>
<P>
   Hear Music, which will occupy part of the Sony Style store,
intends to buy servers to install at its four other outlets, in
Berkeley, Palo Alto, Santa Monica and Chicago, as well as in future
locations around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In existing stores, Hear's listening stations are equipped with
CD changers, which are slow to switch between songs, &UR;  &LR; break down
easily, and can play only up to 10 CDs per station. In addition to
playing thousands of CDs at the touch of a button, the Sony server
lets patrons read articles and music recommendations at 11
interactive stations in the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a quantum leap for us,'' said Don MacKinnon, president of
Hear, who is also a fan of Sony headphones and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Hear won't give preference to Sony recordings and in fact the
contract between the two companies states that it cannot be asked
to do so, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Swinney expects Sony to recoup its initial investment in Metreon
within seven years. If its bet pans out, of course, the ultimate
payoff will be much greater.

FAWN RAISED WITH HUMAN ASSIST CREATES QUANDARY IN SMALL TOWN

<P>
   LINN VALLEY, Kan. _ The tale of Pretty Girl, an orphaned deer
that paces alone in a tiny petting zoo after having the run of this
small community, sounds like a Disney story waiting for a happy
ending.
</P>
<P>
   All looked lost for the spotted fawn in July 1996 when children
said they came upon coyotes devouring its mother in northern Linn
County.
</P>
<P>
   The children plucked the fawn from the wild and delivered it to
Mary Perkins' small yellow house on the edge of the private
community of Linn Valley Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins was the natural choice.
</P>
<P>
   Since moving to Linn County from Roeland Park in 1986, she had
kept a trough just outside her back yard, where deer would gather
for regular feedings. She watched as opossums dined from her cat's
dish on the back porch, and she put out food for any sort of hungry
stray that wandered the community.
</P>
<P>
   She had even raised another fawn from a bottle until a
neighborhood dog that ate in her yard frightened it off.
</P>
<P>
   So Perkins stocked up on baby formula, bought bottle nipples
from the local co-op and raised the fawn, which she named Pretty
Girl, in her back yard.
</P>
<P>
   When the animal grew big enough, it regularly hopped Perkins'
fence to explore the neighborhood, nibble at landscaped yards and
try to pal around with residents.
</P>
<P>
   It is illegal to keep a wild animal. Charlie Ward, a regional
supervisor with the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks, said
that what kept Perkins in the clear is the same thing that has
doomed Pretty Girl to her 35-by-65-foot pen at Linn Valley Lakes.
The deer was free to come and go from Perkins' yard like a wild
animal, but it chose to wander about town and try to play with
people like a pet.
</P>
<P>
   The way Perkins tells the story, Pretty Girl was an oversized,
graceful version of Mary's Little Lamb.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor little thing would follow anybody anywhere, she was
so tame,'' Perkins said. ``She wanted to go to church. She'd follow
people while they walked up to the mailbox and back.''
</P>
<P>
   That is true, say others in Linn Valley, which became a city in
November. But the qualities that Perkins found so endearing in
Pretty Girl _ wandering into houses, stretching on her hind legs to
snack on tall plants, rearing up in play _ upset some of Perkins'
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Carpenter, 7, likes to pet Pretty Girl in the zoo, but
she was afraid to play outside when the deer ran loose. Last spring
her brother, Josh, 11, tried to run the animal off with a broom so
the little girl could play in peace. The deer reared up and
scratched Josh's face, said his mother, Sue Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins ``did it a favor, saving it, and that's wonderful,''
Carpenter said, ``but you can't keep an animal that's hurting
people.''
</P>
<P>
   She told Larry Dwyer, general manager of the Linn Valley
Property Owners' Association, who called Wildlife and Parks for
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing was just getting too big. When it was a fawn, it
wasn't much of a problem,'' Dwyer said. ``The choices were either
round her up and put her in the pen, or destroy her. And she'd been
like a pet to a lot of people around here, so we didn't want to put
her down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like that deer.''
</P>
<P>
   So Pretty Girl's freedom ended in April 1998, while Perkins was
in the hospital with heart problems. Linn Valley officials took the
deer and locked it in the largest pen of the community's small
petting zoo. Ward said Perkins agreed to have the deer confined,
but Perkins insists she'd never consent to locking up a creature
that had grown up in such freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them when they put her in there that she'd be better
off dead,'' Perkins said. `` &UR; `I'd shoot her right now, if I had a
gun,' I told them. They don't want her to have a good life.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty Girl is being neglected in the petting zoo, Perkins and
her supporters say.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the deer and animals in the other pens had fresh
straw, food and water. But Perkins said that the animals usually
lived in mud and that the area was spruced up after a reporter
asked about it. The deer had mud halfway up its legs, and its water
bucket looked as if it had been lifted from mud recently and placed
on drier land. Fresh straw was spread over deep mud outside the
deer's corrugated metal shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Mills, a Wildlife and Parks conservation officer who
routinely checks on the deer's living conditions, said the zoo was
taking proper care of the animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been up there that the deer didn't have food and
water,'' Mills said. ``All you have to do is look at the deer and
know that it's had plenty to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins' daughter, Marija Fitzpatrick of Fontana, thinks
captivity has instilled such a fear of humans in Pretty Girl that
the deer could be released into the wild and never bother anyone
again.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the zoo suggests that is unlikely. Pretty Girl stays
on the perimeter of the pen to be close to visitors as they walk
around. She enjoys being scratched and is especially fond of
touching humans' noses with her own in a sort of deer kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty Girl would not last long in the wild, said Ward, the park
department supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first hunter that came along would've popped it, because
it would've thought it was a friend,'' Ward said. ``I wish we
could've gotten to it sooner so we could've released it into the
wild. But because it was hand-raised, it was ruined.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins thought she had found a happy ending to the story a few
weeks ago, when she invited someone with plenty of land to take
Pretty Girl so the animal could run free again. But they found a
truck backed up to the zoo's fence, blocking the deer's way out.
</P>
<P>
   That is because officials caught wind of the plan, and only
someone with a permit can take the animal. Perkins and her
supporters hope to find someone with enough land to make Pretty
Girl happy and the right paperwork to satisfy the state.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter enjoys looking at the deer at the petting zoo, but
finding a better home for the animal sounds like a good idea to
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``That animal doesn't belong caged,'' Carpenter said. ``But at
the same time, it doesn't belong in a community with small
children.''

 By NADINE BROZAN and GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For Maron Waxman, practicing Judaism has been a
series of deepening experiences. She began lighting Sabbath candles
after her children were born, in the 1970s. In the next decade, she
started studying Hebrew. And from once having attended synagogue
only infrequently, Ms. Waxman has been going twice weekly of late,
Friday nights and Saturday mornings. She also serves as president
of the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue, a Manhattan congregation
affiliated with Judaism's Reform movement.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent airplane flight, she worked on a transliteration of
Hebrew prayers for members of her congregation who do not read that
language. Taking a break, she opened a book of Jewish short
stories. ``This is not what I would have been doing on a plane five
years ago,'' said Ms. Waxman, who is director of special publishing
at the American Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   Yet her closer attention to her faith's traditions is by no
means untypical among members of the Reform movement, Judaism's
largest liberal branch and one that is now undergoing some major
internal shifts.
</P>
<P>
   More than a century ago, Reform leaders declared practices like
wearing skullcaps and prayer shawls and using Hebrew in services to
be dated relics of the past, and emphasized instead a focus on
social ethics and a highly cerebral approach to the faith.
</P>
<P>
   But in a symbolically resonant gesture, Reform's rabbinic arm,
the Central Conference of American Rabbis, in Pittsburgh last week
adopted a document that encourages the movement's members to
explore traditional rituals.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbis' statement _ known as the Pittsburgh Principles _ is
advisory, far from binding in a movement that values individual
autonomy. But by commending study of the mitzvot, the sacred
obligations that include traditional rituals that are required in
more conservative branches of Judaism, the rabbis positively
acknowledged a trend among many of the 1.5 million Reform Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The mitzvot (Hebrew for commandments) are wide-ranging, covering
religious and social practices in Judaism. The Talmud counts 613
mitzvot in all, of which one, for example, would be the wearing of
tefillin, the small leather boxes, containing four passages of
Scripture, worn on the forehead and arm during morning prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for guidance, for assistance, for help in
understanding what the Reform movement stands for,'' said Rabbi
Richard Levy of Los Angeles, the conference's immediate past
president, who wrote the draft statement on which the document is
based. ``The Pittsburgh Principles will help them understand
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The shift occurs amid growing public interest in ritual,
evidenced by a boom in books on prayer, meditation and other
aspects of religious tradition. Even the Latin Mass has made a
comeback in some Roman Catholic dioceses.
</P>
<P>
   The greater interest in tradition among Reform Jews is something
the movement's leaders attribute to several factors _ the
widespread spiritual searching going on in the United States, a
longing among liberal Jews to connect with their roots, and a
heightened interest in traditional practices among Reform rabbis,
who since 1971 have been required to spend a year of study in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Sheldon Zimmerman, president of Hebrew Union
College-Jewish Institute of Religion, said the desire of many to
reconnect with religious tradition came amid a decline in
anti-Semitism in the United States in which the larger society less
frequently reminds Jews of their identity. ``The question today is,
why be Jewish?'' he said. ``No other generation has had to answer
that question.''
</P>
<P>
   At Hebrew Union, Zimmerman said he saw some people studying to
be rabbis and cantors who had enrolled partly ``to find themselves
Jewishly.'' And during the study year in Israel, he said, many
students discover traditions that become important to them, ``like
wearing a prayer shawl, covering their heads, experimenting with
keeping kosher.''
</P>
<P>
   But interest in tradition is evident among lay people as well.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Paul Menitoff, the conference's executive vice president,
said he measured the change in Reform's culture by comparing what
he saw at two national meetings of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations, the Reform movement's synagogue arm, that occurred
22 years apart in Dallas. At the first, in 1976, one had to look
``long and hard'' to find anyone wearing a skullcap at Sabbath
services. But at the meeting that took place there last year, he
said, at least half of those attending wore a head covering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a change in the sociology of what we're all
about,'' Menitoff said. ``Our parents and grandparents were coming
to this country and trying to become Americanized. They wanted
their kids to be as American as apple pie, and they did a very good
job.'' Members of the younger generations are now searching for
their roots, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of change can be found in many synagogues. Leonard
Gordon, a lawyer who arranges investments in companies that make
advanced medical devices, said he grew up six decades ago attending
a Reform synagogue in Cleveland where the rabbi kept ``secretly
kosher'' and no one wore a skullcap. Now, attending the Jewish
Center of the Hamptons in Easthampton, N.Y., he has started Torah
study (in English) and has been increasing his knowledge of Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, when Rabbi Peter Rubinstein was interviewed
for the job of senior rabbi at Central Synagogue in Manhattan, the
search committee asked if there was anything in particular it
should know about him. He replied that he wore a skullcap and
prayer shawl when he led services. The committee told him that
rabbis at Central did not do such things, he recalled. ``I said,
`You had better have a long discussion, not about me, but about who
you are as a Reform synagogue. Reform Judaism is about the ability
to make a decisions _ now you are telling me that we may not have a
choice.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Rubinstein got a call from the committee saying
that wearing a skullcap was not a litmus test; he was soon hired.
</P>
<P>
   At the Stephen Wise synagogue, where Ms. Waxman is president,
Rabbi Gary Bretton Granatoor said a ``remarkable transformation''
was going on, involving an increase in the use of Hebrew in
services, a greater level of singing and chanting by congregants
and a deepening interest among adults in religious education.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, some lay people want to handle duties, like
visiting the sick, that an earlier generation left largely to the
rabbis and cantors. ``There is a group in the synagogue called
Morei Derech, which means role models, and they are lay people
taking on responsibilities that in the past many congregants felt
professionals had to do,'' Granatoor said. ``That is exactly what
mitzvot is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet much of the embrace of tradition by Reform Jews is occurring
in the home, too.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Sue Ann Wasserman, associate director of the department of
religious living at the Union of American Hebrew Congregations,
said she maintained a kosher kitchen in her home, a practice begun
in her college years at Brandeis University. ``I wanted my daily
life to feel Jewish, to feel significantly Jewish,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wasserman said she would ``bend'' her dietary rules a bit
outside her home. ``I see it as a way of balancing my desire to
make friends of people in all faiths and communities,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, her department is developing a wallet-sized
card listing various traditional blessings, to be spoken at meals
or on other particular occasions. That such a thing would be in the
works, she said, is a sign of the times within the Reform movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are bringing their Jewishness out in public,'' she
said. ``Part of this whole trend really shows how comfortable Jews
are in America, how secure we are.''

COMMENTARY: ARE YOU READY? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About a year and a half ago I interviewed John Chambers, the
president of Cisco Systems _ the company that makes the black boxes
that connect the Internet. Chambers declared that, though most
people did not grasp it yet, the Internet was about to change
``everything'' about how people work, invest, learn, shop and
communicate. I wrote down what he had to say, but thought of it as
the sort of overstatement one could expect from an Internet exec.
</P>
<P>
   Well, a few weeks later, Cisco sent me a box of stuff from its
upcoming ad campaign _ a sweatshirt, a coffee mug and a tape. I put
the tape in the VCR and saw all these young people looking into the
camera and asking: ``Are you ready?'' All I could think of was:
``Are you ready for what?''
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half later I now appreciate Cisco's ad, and
Chambers' prediction. The year 1999 will go down as the year that
the Internet really began to penetrate the consciousness of
Americans _ that the way they buy everything from cars to airline
tickets, and the way they communicate, invest, work and learn, is
being fundamentally transformed by the Web. But it has come on so
fast that people are feeling overwhelmed by it. When I travel
around America today, one of the most frequent foreign policy
questions I get is about cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Parents are worried because three things are happening at once:
</P>
<P>
   1. The Internet is becoming increasingly pervasive, unavoidable
and indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   2. There is a dawning realization that the Internet, as such a
tool, is different from radio, television and newspapers in that it
is a totally open, interactive technology _ but with no built-in
editor, publisher, censor or even filters. With one mouse click,
you can wander into a Nazi beer hall or a pornographer's library,
hack the NASA computers or roam the Sorbonne library, and no one is
there to stop or direct you. You interact with the network naked.
The only really effective filters are the values, knowledge and
judgment that your kid brings to the Web in his or her own head and
heart.
</P>
<P>
   3. At the same time, more moms and dads are both working outside
the home, so less parenting is going on generally _ less time is
being spent filling kids' heads and hearts at home _ and people are
becoming increasingly dependent instead on their schools to raise
and nurture their children for them.
</P>
<P>
   When you take such a totally open network and you combine it
with parents' being able to spend less time building their kids'
internal codes and filters, then you add the fact that the Internet
is going to become the nervous system of our commerce and society,
you have a potentially dangerous cocktail.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the most important thing parents need to understand
about preparing their kids for the Internet world is that it
requires not more whiz-bang high-tech skills, but rather more
old-fashioned fundamentals _ reading, writing and arithmetic, plus
church and synagogue. Kindergarten becomes more important than
college in the Internet age. That is, unless parents are building
kids with sound fundamentals _ with the individual judgment, values
and knowledge skills to handle this technology on their own _ Lord
only knows what can happen. It can be like everyone letting his
kids drive without a license, map or sense of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Steve Case, the CEO of America Online, what he tells
parents. He said: ``It requires a thoughtful, sustained, integrated
effort. And perhaps the Internet, while only part of the problem
parents now face, can be an even greater part of the solution. You
have to make sure your kids are connected, because that is the
future and it is important that everyone have access to the future,
so we don't widen society's gaps with a digital divide as well. But
as you get connected, you have to understand this is an empowering
medium. It gives you millions of new choices, but many will not be
appropriate. So with empowerment must come greater
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the faster your kid's modem, the faster he or she can
get online, the stronger must be his or her own personal software.
You've heard of Moore's Law, that the performance of
microprocessors doubles every year and the price halves every year?
Well, here (with tongue slightly in cheek) is Friedman's Law:
Parents should add one hour per week of quality time with their
children each time the speed of their kid's modem doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Now go check your kid's modem.

NEWS ANALYSIS: IN SEC'S DOCK, LAWYERS WALK IN CLIENTS' SHOES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two lawyers who have nimbly defended prosperous Wall
Street professionals stood before judges with lawyers of their own
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The cases, though different in magnitude, highlight the power
that defense lawyers wield in securities-law prosecutions _ and the
limits of the Securities and Exchange Commission's patience with
those who may use that power improperly.
</P>
<P>
   The more dramatic case surfaced in Manhattan on Thursday, when
Hartley Bernstein, who represented defrauded investors before he
began defending those accused of such frauds, pleaded guilty to
federal charges that he had participated in a fraud conspiracy that
generated more than $100 million in illegal profits. He also
confessed to lying to the SEC in its investigation of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise confession by Bernstein covered crimes he said he
committed while serving as the lawyer for Sterling Foster, a
defunct penny stock brokerage house in Melville, and for various
start-up companies that Sterling Foster brought to market from 1994
to early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors have charged that Sterling Foster was
secretly controlled by Randolph Pace and Alan Novich, who are
awaiting trial on charges of organizing the criminal conspiracy in
which Bernstein said he had participated. They have denied the
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   The less noticed of the two recent cases involved Charles J.
Hecht, another high-profile New York lawyer. Hecht, a partner in
Hecht &AMP; Steckman, has represented a number of SEC defendants over
the years, but perhaps his most colorful long-running client was
Fred Mazzeo, who in the early 1980s operated a prolific New York
penny-stock brokerage house called the Creative Securities Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1985, Mazzeo's firm failed as he tried to prop up the
prices of some of the stocks that it had underwritten. In the
aftermath, Hecht helped Mazzeo file a securities-fraud lawsuit that
accused Alan Abelson, the longtime editor of Barron's magazine, of
conspiring with short-sellers to destroy his business. In 1988,
that lawsuit was dismissed by the court as baseless.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Hecht's client was another securities lawyer,
William N. Levy of Voorhees, N.J. Levy is one of more than a
half-dozen defendants who were accused by the SEC in March 1998 of
manipulating the stock of Electro-Optical Systems Corp., which said
it was developing an electronic fingerprint-based security and
identification system.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares had been widely promoted on the Internet,
and the SEC charged that Levy and the other defendants garnered
more than $12 million in illegal profits from thousands of
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Levy denied any wrongdoing, but the commission nevertheless
obtained a court order freezing his assets. In the sometimes hectic
negotiations to have that freeze lifted last spring, Hecht agreed
that his client would provide regulators with a complete accounting
of his financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
   That was when the trouble began. In a complaint to the court
last fall, the SEC accused Hecht of receiving legal fees from his
client while the assets were supposed to be frozen. More seriously,
the SEC said that Hecht had allowed his client to submit an
incomplete and misleading accounting. It asked Federal Judge Denise
L. Cote in Manhattan to hold Hecht in contempt of court. Suddenly,
Levy's lawyer needed a lawyer of his own.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing on the contempt motion in December, a staff lawyer
for the SEC explained why the agency was moving so forcefully
against Hecht. ``We don't have vast resources, say like the IRS
does or the Justice Department, to investigate things,'' said Dan
Hurson. ``We have to be able to rely on accountings ordered by the
court that are fair and accurate and complete and not misleading in
any respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Hoffman, representing Hecht, explained that his client
had simply overlooked the fact that Levy was the source of the
legal fees he collected, having expected that those fees would be
paid by one of Levy's relatives. As for the questionable
accounting, Hoffman insisted it was a misunderstanding that arose
in the confusion of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Blackburn, at the SEC's New York regional office,
disputes that explanation. ``This is not a case about the crush of
business,'' he said in a recent interview. ``It is a case about
honesty and respect for the court and other lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obvious rancor in the case, a settlement was reached
this spring that called for the commission to withdraw its contempt
motion, in exchange for which Hecht was to turn over more than
$150,000 that he had received from Levy. He also paid more than
$20,000 to compensate the commission for its expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement required him to apologize to the court _ which he
did, in a carefully worded statement read to Judge Cote at a
hearing on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that he had never intended to disobey court orders, he
apologized for not having been more diligent and attentive and
promised to be more careful in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said that Levy's financial statement was ``false in
terms of its language'' and ``was also intended to be misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   While she allowed the SEC to withdraw its contempt motion, Judge
Cote also told Hecht, ``I believe you fell down in this case. You
did not stay alert to your obligations to the court, to the law or
to your license.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Levy, the SEC's case against him and his co-defendants
has been deferred while a criminal investigation continues,
Blackburn said.

   YELTSIN NAMES REFORMERS TO TOP ECONOMIC POSTS
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin placed two familiar and reform-minded
fiscal experts in top economic posts, but after a week of brutal
infighting among his closest advisers the question of who really
controls his latest Government seemed no clearer than before.
Yeltsin appointed Viktor Khristenko, a deputy prime minister until
last August's fiscal collapse, to the new post of First Deputy
Prime Minister for macroeconomics and financial policy. He also
named Mikhail Zadornov, the finance minister until this month, as
the government's special negotiator with the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   A CHILL ON FOOD REPORTING
</P>
<P>
   A series of state libel laws that were aimed at protecting the
makers of agricultural products from food scares is putting a chill
on the continuing debate about what the public should eat. Food
producers say they need protection against irresponsible claims,
but critics say the laws cut off debate on health issues.
</P>
<P>
   SPECULATORS BORROW YEN
</P>
<P>
   The spread between Japanese and higher American interest rates
has recently been widening, tempting speculators to borrow yen at
bargain-basement prices, convert them to dollars and invest them in
United States Treasury bills. The idea is to sell the bills later
on, pocket most of the interest payments and then repay the
low-interest yen debt.
</P>

   MICROSOFT OFFICIAL TAKES SABBATICAL

<P>
   Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's chief technology officer, will take
a yearlong sabbatical to pursue his own scientific research and
travel, the company announced. Several news organizations reported
that Myhrvold was leaving after a falling out with Microsoft's
president, Steven Ballmer. Microsoft executives said the reports
were inaccurate.

ISRAELI-BACKED TROOPS START TO WITHDRAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ Troops from an Israeli-backed militia began withdrawing
Monday night from the northern-most fringe of the Israeli-occupied
``security zone'' in South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The pullback by the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army was seen as a
significant retreat from Hezbollah guerrillas waging a war of
attrition to end Israeli control of the south.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear whether the move could also be a step to the
wider Israeli withdrawal promised by Israel's newly elected Prime
Minister Ehud Barak from the nine-mile wide swath that Israel
occupies along the Lebanon-Israel border to protect itself from
hostile incursions.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 p.m. Monday night, three of the SLA's armored personnel
carriers, three aging tanks, and two trailer trucks transporting
heavy equipment formed a convoy exiting Jezzine.
</P>
<P>
   And as the exodus got under way, the people of the predominantly
Christian village were left fearing possible reprisals from
fighters of the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah, or ``Party of God.''
</P>
<P>
   The commander of Israel's South Lebanon Army, General Antoine
Lahd announced Monday that the phased withdrawal from Jezzine would
begin that night and continue over the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lahd, a 70-year-old renegade Lebanese army officer, has been
sentenced to death for treason by the Beirut government for
commanding the 2,000-man strong militia since it was established in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters at his home in Marjayoun: ``The situation in
Jezzine could not handle any more deaths. Our aim in being in
Jezzine was to protect its people and we hope the government will
do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah has ratcheted up its attacks and proven a dogged and
determined opposition to the Israeli occupation. It often plants
roadside bombs around Jezzine and seriously wounded the militia's
senior Jezzine commander and killed one of his senior officers this
year. Five SLA militiamen have been killed and 34 wounded in the
fighting since January.
</P>
<P>
   Lahd conceded to reporters that his militia's morale had been
``battered'' but said he had offered to relocate the troops to
homes inside the occupation zone.
</P>
<P>
   But dozens of militiamen are switching sides, pledging
allegiance to the Lebanese government and vowing to remain in
Jezzine even if they face treason charges, according to Edmund
Rizk, a former member of parliament from Jezzine and a leader of
the town.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Monday night, Rizk said he had been
urging militiamen in the area to turn themselves in to the
authorities and assuring them that the Lebanese government and the
Lebanese Army would ensure ``Lebanese law is there to protect the
citizens of Jezzine.''
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah guerrillas see the SLA troops -- whose uniforms have
Hebrew writing on them and who receive monthly stipends from the
Israeli government-- as religious infidels and traitors.
</P>
<P>
   The pullback of SLA forces in Jezzine, observers say, will be an
important test of the Lebanese army's ability to preserve the rule
of law and to control Hezbollah's guerrillas in a town formerly
controlled by the Israeli-backed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah vowed Sunday that his
forces would not enter Jezzine or use it as a base for launching
further attacks on the SLA and Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
   But Nasrallah has made it clear that he believes militiamen who
collaborated with Israel should be tried in Lebanese courts.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah has offered amnesty to militia members who surrender,
but Nasrallah said, ``Those who serve the enemy until the last day
and have not renounced their collaboration when the enemy drops
them should not benefit from the amnesty.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said fears that Hezbollah would move quickly to apprehend
and execute milita members were ``exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Lahd reiterated Monday that even though he faces the death
penalty as a collaborator with Israel that he has nothing to fear
from an Israeli pullout of southern Lebanon because he is a citizen
of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   The same cannot be said of the several thousand Christian
residents who live in Jezzine and are widely viewed as
collaborators by Hezbollah. Their fate remains uncertain, as does
that of tens of thousands of Lebanese residents living in the
security zone whose husbands or sons supported, or as many claim,
were coerced into fighting with the SLA.
</P>
<P>
   The move out of Jezzine comes at a potentially critical moment
in the long war of attrition between Hezbollah and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In his election campaign, Israel's Prime Minister-elect Barak
promised to remove within one year the roughly 1,000 Israeli troops
stationed in the the self-proclaimed ``security zone'' that it has
occupied since 1985 to protect against border attacks.

EUROPEANS WILL CONTRIBUTE MOST OF PEACEKEEPING FORCE, CLINTON
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of a key NATO decision on how to
assemble a large peacekeeping force for Yugoslavia, President
Clinton said on Monday that Europeans would contribute most of the
force and would pay most of the cost of rebuilding Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In a Memorial Day address at Arlington National Cemetery,
Clinton said the decision to intervene in Kosovo was aimed at
saving lives, including American lives.
</P>
<P>
   NATO military leaders are expected to finalize planning for the
Yugoslav peacekeeping force at a meeting in Belgium on Tuesday. The
president stressed that a large majority of the troops in the force
will come from other NATO nations and perhaps countries outside
NATO like Russia and Ukraine. The force is expected to number about
50,000 troops, including roughly 7,000 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that many Americans believe that this is not our
fight,'' Clinton told an audience of active-duty and retired
military personnel amid the crowded rows of bone-white crosses at
Arlington cemetery on Monday morning. ``But remember why many of
the people are laying in these graves out here _ because of what
happened in Europe and because of what was allowed to go on too
long before people intervened. What we are doing today will save
lives, including American lives, in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 20-minute speech, Clinton made no mention of diplomatic
efforts to resolve the Balkan conflict, which have followed a
meandering course over the past month through Moscow, Helsinki,
Berlin and Belgrade.But White House aides said that Clinton spoke
for 30 minutes on Monday morning with Sergei Stepashin, the new
Russian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the two discussed progress on the diplomatic
front and agreed to a meeting on Tuesday in Bonn among the three
principal negotiators _ Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott,
President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland and Viktor Chernomyrdin, the
Russian special envoy for the Balkans. The three diplomats are
expected to brief Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany after
their meeting, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely that Chernomyrdin and Ahtisaari will travel to
Belgrade later in the week to speak with President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia, an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that Stepashin initiated the call to Clinton and that the president
on Monday was ``cautiously optimistic'' that the talks in Europe
this week could lead to some progress. He said that some leaders
detected ``a little movement'' by Milosevic toward accepting the
NATO conditions for ending the bombing of Yugoslavia. He suggested
the pressure on Milosevic may have grown after he was indicted last
week on war crimes charges by an international tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the Memorial Day address to repeat NATO's core
demands for ending the aerial bombardment of Serbia, the dominant
republic of what remains of Yugoslavia. Clinton said that Serbia
must withdraw its forces from the province of Kosovo, where they
have been carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing that has
displaced more than 1.5 million Kosovars of Albanian descent from
their homes. He said that the Kosovo refugees must be able to
return home in peace. And he said that Serbia's government must
accept a peacekeeping force in Kosovo ``with NATO at its core.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also replied to complaints from domestic critics
on both the left and right that the United States had become
excessively entangled in a regional conflict, now in its 10th week,
that does not threaten vital American security or economic
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this military campaign the United States has borne a large
share of the burden, as we must, because we have a greater capacity
to bear that burden,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all Americans should know that we have been strongly
supported by our European allies; that when the peacekeeping force
goes in there, the overwhelming majority of people will be
European; and that when the reconstruction begins, the overwhelming
amount of investment will be European,'' he said. ``This is
something we have done together.''
</P>
<P>
   About three-quarters of the aircraft flying missions over
Yugoslavia are American, and much of the weaponry is also American,
like the cruise missiles launched from warships and B-52 heavy
bombers. Clinton has asked Congress for $6 billion in emergency
appropriations for the Pentagon, most of it to cover the costs of
the Balkan air war. Congress approved nearly twice that much, using
the emergency bill to authorize a military-wide pay increase and
other Pentagon spending unrelated to the Yugoslav conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO meeting in Mons, Belgium, will address the composition
of the Kosovo peacekeeping force. Military commanders from NATO's
19 countries will decide which nation will contribute which sorts
of troops, not only combat forces but engineers, mine-clearing
teams, transportation units, translators, intelligence officers and
medical battalions.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has demanded that any peacekeeping forces be unarmed
or lightly armed, and that NATO not dominate the force. But the
United States and its allies insist that all units be capable of
defending themselves and that NATO will provide the command
structure and the bulk of the personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said on Monday that the stakes were high in Yugoslavia
for Europe and the world. He vowed that the West cannot allow the
assault on an entire population to go unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can say 'no' to that,'' Clinton declared before the
veterans at Arlington on Monday, ``and we should.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling Kosovo ``a very small province in a small country,
Clinton said it was nevertheless `` a big test of what we believe
in.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton said the American involvement demonstrates ``our
commitment to leave to our children a world where people are not
uprooted and ravaged and slaughtered en masse because of their
race, their ethnicity or their religion; our fundamental interest
in building a lasting peace in an undivided and free Europe, a
place which saw two world wars when that dreamed failed in the 20th
century; and our interest in preserving our alliance for freedom
and peace with our 18 NATO allies.''

A BANGED-UP EWING LUMBERS ON

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ His quadriceps and shoulders are the newest
additions to the list of injuries that have riddled Patrick Ewing.
They are just two more parts of an aging 36-year-old body that will
require extra attention, tape, ice, heating balm, Ibuprofen, what
have you from the medicine cabinet when Ewing leads the New York
Knicks against the Indiana Pacers Tuesday night in Game 2 of the
NBA Eastern Conference finals at Market Square Arena.
</P>
<P>
   They will go along with the aching ribs Ewing hurt in Game 2 of
the first-round series against the Miami Heat, the right wrist he
broke last season, and the sore Achilles' tendon that has bothered
him all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how hurt I am,'' Ewing said with a smile Monday,
refusing to divulge exactly what was ailing him.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, Ewing proved to be a big pain in the neck to
the Pacers as he led the Knicks to a 93-90 victory, snapping
Indiana's streak of 12 consecutive playoff victories at home. Ewing
grabbed 10 rebounds and scored 16 points in 40 minutes.
</P>

   That had Pacers coach Larry Bird shaking his head after Monday's
workout. Bird was amazed that Ewing could perform as well as he did
with the injuries he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick Ewing is hurt and he played 40 minutes Monday,'' Bird
deadpanned. ``Rik Smits has been hurting all year, and if we played
him 40 you wouldn't see him for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Was it a case of an aging warrior wanting to go out on his
shield?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is, but he's playing and that's all that
matters,'' Bird said. ``Patrick is a friend of mine, but I don't
want to hear about how hurt he is, because he played 40 minutes.
That's a lot of minutes for a guy who's hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Pacers guard Mark Jackson, a former Knick teammmate of
Ewing's, ``He's milking it. If a guy who takes shots and makes
shots and then hobbles around . . . well, I just wonder when the
limp is going to disappear, like Keyser Soze.''
</P>
<P>
   Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy could only shrug when asked about
Ewing's health.
</P>
<P>
   ``It amazes me, too,'' he said. ``It's showing a tremendous will
to win and heart. And I know that it doesn't surprise Mark because
he's played with him.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ewing has aged, and as the injuries have mounted for the
former Cambridge Rindge &AMP; Latin and Georgetown star, the Knicks
have had to refocus their strategy of making him the focal point of
their offense.
</P>
<P>
   No longer are the Knicks cast in Ewing's lumbering image.
</P>
<P>
   This season, they have reinvented themselves as something of a
transition team, with a rotation of hyperquick guards including
Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell, who has provided a burst of
energy off the bench as the sixth man. Houston led the Knicks in
scoring Sunday with 19 points while Sprewell had 16 off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came down to crunch time, there was Ewing, hobbled
as ever, making 4 of 4 crucial free throws in the final 51.3
seconds to enable the Knicks to salt away Game 1, neutralizing
Indiana's home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy was asked if there was any thought about giving Ewing
some rest at the end of Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``None _ zero,'' he said. ``He's finishing games. We want him in
there at the end of games.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not unlike a baseball manager coming out late in the game
to inquire about his ace on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what do they always say?'' Van Gundy asked. ``It's always,
`I'm fine.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But wasn't Ewing tired?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, everybody is tired,'' Van Gundy said. ``Fatigue is a
part of it, but that's what makes him a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Van Gundy knows it is not in his best interest to expose
his aging center to 40 hard minutes of combat against the league's
elite centers. That is why Ewing has been insulated by a strong and
athletic frontcourt that includes power forwards Larry Johnson and
Kurt Thomas and a bench rotation of Chris Dudley and Marcus Camby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, because Patrick is so hobbled, we can't ask him to
play the top centers in the league for more than a few minutes at a
time in any game,'' Van Gundy said. ``But because of his great
heart and will to win, he'll give you what he can.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that the eighth-seeded Knicks are in the Eastern finals,
three victories from a berth in the NBA Finals, Ewing is prepared
to sacrifice his body in the quest for an elusive title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to get to the next level,'' Ewing said.
``And if we have the opportunity, then we have to try and seize it.
Whether it comes this year, or next year, my goal every year is to
win a championship. I think about it a lot. That's the only thing I
want to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what price his body has to pay.

IN PLEA FOR HIS LIFE, KURDISH REBEL OFFERS TO HALT WAR  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IMRALI, Turkey _ On the first day of his trial on treason
charges, the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan apologized for
his past and said he would call for an end to guerrilla violence if
the Turkish authorities would give him the chance to turn his army
into a civilian political party.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with rising emotion, Ocalan admitted that he and his
fighters were responsible for all the killings and other acts
attributed to them by prosecutors, and added: ``I could list many
more you haven't mentioned.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he had come to believe that his approach to solving
the country's ethnic problems was ``a dead-end street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time to end this conflict, or else it will get much
worse,'' he said. ``I want to dedicate my life to bringing Turks
and Kurds together.''
</P>
<P>
   There have long been complaints from Kurds, a distinct ethnic
group in Turkey and neighboring countries, about official
suppression of their language and culture. The Kurdish guerrillas
have been at war with the Turkish government for 15 years, a
struggle that according to various estimates has taken more than
30,000 lives and cost Ankara $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's statement was sure to astonish many Turks, Kurdish or
not, and many may find it hard to take seriously. For more than a
decade he has been portrayed here as a bloodthirsty killer
fanatically dedicated to dividing and destroying the Turkish
republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see this as a great chance for the state, but it's
hard to imagine them taking it,'' said a European diplomat who was
at the court session on Monday. ``Compromising with an enemy you've
been fighting and denouncing so fiercely for so long runs against
something that's very deeply ingrained in this part of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial is being held under tight security at the remote
prison island of Imrali, where Ocalan (pronounced OH-ja-lan) has
been the only inmate since his capture in Kenya in October. He
entered the courtroom unannounced through a side door and took the
sole seat inside a glass booth reserved for him.
</P>
<P>
   The outburst of anger that some had expected from parents of
fallen soldiers who were in the courtroom did not materialize. But
three were led out later, after they began shouting epithets and
waving pictures of their dead sons at Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   As is the custom in Turkish security courts, the three judges,
including one military officer, shared the raised dais with
prosecutors. Defense lawyers sat below. Two of them left early,
evidently upset that they had not been able to agree with their
client on a strategy.
</P>
<P>
   After the presiding judge rejected a motion that the trial be
postponed, prosecutors began reading their indictment, which was a
detailed account of Ocalan's personal and political history.
</P>
<P>
   It described his founding of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or
PKK, in 1978, his decision to begin an armed campaign in 1984 and
his use of training bases in Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere. The
indictment included reports of specific engagements in which
Ocalan's fighters were said to have killed soldiers, police
officers and civilians.
</P>
<P>
   It is universally assumed here that the trial will end with a
guilty verdict, most likely a death sentence; Ocalan has not
entered a plea. Whether the sentence will be carried out is
uncertain. There have been no executions in Turkey since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership council that has taken over direction of Ocalan's
group since his capture issued a statement before the trial began
on Monday threatening retaliation if he is executed. ``Policies of
extermination and vengeance, especially aimed against the person of
our president, will not go unanswered,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In another reminder of the reality of war in southeastern
Turkey, the military announced that soldiers had killed 10 rebels
and lost one of their own in clashes over the weekend.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ocalan, 50, was held incommunicado for 10 days after his
capture. He has been allowed only limited meetings with his
lawyers, who seemed confused and ill-prepared on Monday. Some human
rights advocates have said he is being treated unfairly, but Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit on Monday rejected such charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rights of the defendant and his lawyers are being
guarded,'' Ecevit said. ``It is now up to the independent Turkish
judiciary to have its say.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the government and mass media seemed likely to report
Ocalan's professed conversion to democracy with skepticism, the
dozen foreign diplomats who were in the courtroom, among them
representatives of the United Nations and the European Parliament,
described themselves as amazed. None had expected to see the
longtime Marxist firebrand so contrite and at the same time so
overwrought.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went on for minutes on end with just sentence fragments,
and it was impossible to figure out what he was saying,'' said one
diplomat. ``You got the feeling the situation was overwhelming him.
But the message came through anyway, loud and clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's rambling statement lasted nearly 40 minutes. He said he
was worried that he would not have another chance to speak, but the
presiding judge assured him that he would have ample opportunity
later in the trial, which is expected to take weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Ocalan poured scorn on Greece, which he said had
supported his group for years but failed to protect him when he
sought asylum. But the core of his statement was his call for an
end to violence.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had forged his ideology during the 1970s, when
Turkey was being torn by political violence, but that ``since 1990,
I have wanted to change in accordance with the new situation in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give up the armed struggle and have full democracy,
so the PKK can enter the political system,'' he said. ``From this
moment on, I don't want one single soldier or PKK militant to
die.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Barriers against the expression of Kurdish language and
culture should be removed,'' he said. ``Today the best policy would
be to give the Kurds linguistic and cultural freedom. Kurds should
not hesitate to use this democratic chance in the best way
possible. I call on the state not to block the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will work with the Republic of Turkey toward the goal of
peace and brotherhood. In the past, I was the one to blame, the one
responsible. But that is not the case today. I call on both sides
to stop the bloodshed of armed conflict. Call it a cease-fire or
whatever you want. Turkey's future is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan offered to broker a peace, if the court lets him. ``I
will serve the state, because I now see that it is necessary,'' he
said. ``These are my most important words. My service is important
if it extinguishes the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am given new means, I can bring the fighters down from
the mountains in three months. But the state cannot do it. Let us
join together to end this danger. The PKK should see that the only
solution is living together in a single country, together and
without weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize I am saying this too late, but what can I do now?
Maybe I can help. The best shelter for Kurds would be a democratic
republic.''

   A New York Times News Service article sent on Sunday, May 30,
about the scaling back of coverage of refugees from Kosovo,
referred incorrectly to the current assignments in Macedonia and
Albania by The New York Times and by The Washington Post. Neither
paper has cut back its coverage. (One of four Times correspondents
assigned there left temporarily, to complete a report about the
purging of Kosovar Albanians by Serbian forces. The Post plans to
keep at least four correspondents there.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Haute couture, let's face it, is hardly anyone's idea
of a happening concern. Sure, one has the Miller sisters to hold up
as the inevitable example of new blood, and of course there is
Isabella Blow. Ms. Blow _ Izzy to her friends in London, where she
is a kind of muse _ is so crazy about couture that during the
semiannual showings in Paris she will change her outfit two or
three times a day.
</P>
<P>
   But apart from a few rich society figures and the ever-odd
English eccentric, everyone else is screaming ooh-la-la and running
to Gap.
</P>
<P>
   So why are all these fanatically cool people pouring into
Visionaire, the fashion publisher and art gallery in SoHo, to check
out the latest haute couture creations by a couple of Dutch
designers named Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren?
</P>
<P>
   The two men are in a corner talking to Cecilia Dean, a
Visionaire editor who recently was named to the International
Best-Dressed List. And one can see why. Ms. Dean has on a white
pants suit by Viktor &AMP; Rolf, as their label is called. It looks
like any white pants suit, except that it is outlined with a wide
black ruffle, so that Ms. Dean seems to be popping perpetually out
of a dark space.
</P>
<P>
   When the designers showed their black-and-white collection of
stiff skirts and bouffant ruffs in Paris last January, they used
ultraviolet light to create the same effect. Everything white in
the room glowed, including the fashion editor's teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Now 3 of the 17 outfits from that collection are mounted in the
center of the Visionaire gallery. They're on Pucci mannequins that
are wearing ash-blond wigs that have been eccentrically combed out
by Danilo Dixon, a hairdresser, and about $1.2 million worth of
borrowed Vedura jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Standing near the door are Nicole Fischelis, the Saks Fifth
Avenue fashion director, and Lauren Ezersky, who has a fashion show
on cable television. Ms. Fischelis says: ``I wanted Viktor &AMP; Rolf
to do something for Saks. I think they're brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So all these things are not for sale?'' Ms. Ezersky
interjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because talent is so rare,'' Ms. Fischelis continues.
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't immediately learn the answer to Ms. Ezersky's
question, because more people keep trooping in. There is Diane Von
Furstenberg, the designer, and Christian Laboutin, the French
shoemaker, and Shalom Harlow, a model. Ronald van der Kemp, the
Dutch-born designer who's with Guy Laroche in Paris, is here, too.
So are Ruben Toledo, the illustrator, and his wife, Isabel Toledo,
a dressmaker. Someone has just introduced them to Horsting and
Snoeren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love your work,'' Toledo says to the Dutchmen, who have the
shellshocked look of a couple of people from Ohio who've just
stepped out of the Port Authority bus terminal at dawn. They trade
pleasantries, and Toledo nods and says, ``Yeah!''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Ezersky's question is intriguing. Even though Viktor &AMP;
Rolf represent what is optimistically called the ``new couture,''
and have shown their collections independently for three seasons in
Paris, though they will be on the official couture schedule next
month, not one client has bought a single outfit, which costs about
$12,000. That is a relatively small sum in the world of haute
couture, where a made-to-measure suit from Dior, without any
details to speak of, can run $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a client were determined to have a Viktor &AMP; Rolf
creation, she'd have to go to Amsterdam, where the designers are
based. Moreover, she'd have to be able to picture herself in the
clothes _ the very surreal collars rising up like Napoleon
pastries, the almost Victorian silhouettes.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, for their second collection, the one that put them
over with fashion editors and led to their New York invitation,
they created shirts that had literally been blown up with balloons
and confetti. The way the models' heads looked, small and bobbing
above these enormous inflated pigeon breast, it was almost the
reverse effect of seeing a pumped-up bodybuilder in a pair of tiny
briefs. It looked cartoonish.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, not many women can picture themselves in Victor
&AMP; Rolf's exaggerated silhouettes, and that's why the clothes
haven't sold. On the other hand, without commercial constraints,
the designers have been free to express themselves, and in a way,
their overblown shapes are a reaction to Dutch conventionality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion doesn't hold a big value with Dutch people,'' says
Snoeren, who, like his partner, graduated in 1992 from the Arnhem
Institute for the Arts. ``It's all sportswear and second-hand
clothes.'' Horsting adds: ``In Holland, the mentality is you're not
supposed to want to stand out. We made our collections to be
noticed, but it was also a reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the comic brilliance of their second couture show,
Victor &AMP; Rolf have been embraced by the fashion world, especially
by those who look for connections between conceptual art and
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The July collection was really a break-through for us,'' said
Snoeren several days before the Visionaire party as he and
Horsting, both 29, had lunch at Balthazar. They were in town as
guests of Creative Time, an artists group, which had invited them,
along with avant-garde designers like Martin Margiela and Susan
Cianciolo, to be in a site-specific installation at the Brooklyn
Bridge Anchorage. For their exhibition, Horsting and Snoeren
planned to perch like birds in a large cage. ``It reflects the
fashion world,'' Horsting said. ``Who's watching who. Who's in,
who's out.''
</P>
<P>
   But to return to their breakthrough. Snoeren said: ``When things
are extreme, it's really easy to think it is a joke. Of course, for
us it was very serious. But people thought we were clowns.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest collection, their point proven, they moved to more
classic silhouettes. ``To show that we were making serious couture,
we did the first part of the January show in the dark and the
second in light,'' Snoeren said. ``It was like showing we had
conquered our demons and we're ready for reality.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Maybe. Although they seem committed to producing ready-to-wear
as soon as 2000, the only reality they've known is couture, which
even for established houses is a money-losing luxury. Horsting and
Snoeren said they have survived in the six years since finishing
school on a mix of government grants, museum sales and good will.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: In the last year they've been featured in dozens of
magazines, from Vogue to Composite in Tokyo. When Stephen Gan, the
Visionaire editor, decided to have a gallery in his new space on
Mercer Street, Viktor &AMP; Rolf were among the first designers he
thought of. ``They represent a new period of people craving fantasy
in fashion,'' Gan said.
</P>
<P>
   All this attention has been achieved without having a real
product. ``Fashion is not just about clothes,'' Horsting said. ``It
also deals with imagery and marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   His partner added, ``If the name is out there in the world, then
you can apply it to bags and T-shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   Horsting continued, ``You could say that for the last couple of
years our name was the only product we were working on.''
</P>
<P>
   This may sound disingenuous, yet look how successful a company
like Gucci has been using sex and celebrity to sell loafers. Even a
couple of Dutch novices can appreciate that. ``Did you see Julia
Roberts wearing our big blouse in Vanity Fair?'' Snoeren asked.
``She might be coming to the Visionaire party. That's what we were
told.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Anchorage event, with the pair in their bird cage (``The
first thing I can say is they're very brave,'' said Alex de Betak,
a fashion show producer for designers like Donna Karan), Susan
Cianciolo stood nearby and said that she actually enjoys the
commercial side of making clothes _ contrary to what people might
think of someone whose clothes have often been shown in art
galleries. ``I've a million ideas, and I'd like to offer things to
more people,'' she said. ``I just don't want to be me and my
studio.''
</P>
<P>
   van der Kemp of Guy Laroche had a different view. Maybe he was
jealous of Viktor &AMP; Rolf's freedom, he said at Visionaire, glancing
at a mannequin in a ruffled mantilla. ``Once you stop thinking this
way, you lose a lot of your identity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's an impossible situation. Nobody wants clothes.
They want Gap or Banana Republic, or they want something very
special.''

NATO BOMBS STRIKE SANITARIUM, KILLING AT LEAST 16 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SURDULICA, Yugoslavia _ Four years ago, a Croatian soldier
pressed the barrel of a gun to the back of Milica Pjevac's head, as
she and thousands of other Serbs were forced out of the Krajina
region of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the 70-year-old Pjevac was startled out of her sleep,
feeling that same frightening pressure bearing down on the back of
her skull. This time it was her ceiling. But to Pjevac, it felt the
same. It conjured the same feelings of fear and panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a gun to my head,'' the old woman said sadly,
shaking her head and a heavily bandaged right hand, sitting in a
hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   Pjevac was one of the lucky ones who survived after NATO bombs
hit a sanitarium here. She was rescued after being buried in the
rubble for more than an hour. At least 16 people were killed. Up to
five others are missing and presumed dead, crushed under the debris
of two buildings that partially collapsed when NATO bombs hit a
sanitarium complex housing patients with respiratory illnesses,
retirees, and Serb refugees from Bosnia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing here in southern Serbia followed Sunday's bombing of
a bridge in central Serbia that killed at least 11 civilians. The
bombings of the sanitarium and bridge showed that as NATO escalates
its campaign into nearly round-the-clock airstrikes, the risk of
damage to civilians will increase, too.
</P>
<P>
   At least 47 civilians have been killed by NATO bombs in the last
two days, according to Yugoslav officials, who say up to 1,500
civilians have been killed since NATO began bombing March 24. NATO
officials insist they do not target civilians on purpose, and say
mistakes by their pilots have caused only a couple of hundred
deaths, what NATO claims is an acceptable level given the number of
missions flown.
</P>
<P>
   For this town of 15,000, Monday's bombing was a deadly case of
deja vu. On April 27, NATO missiles slammed into a residential
neighborhood here, killing 11, including 10 people in one house.
Officials say four other people later died of their injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Few places in Yugoslavia have suffered more casualties than
Surdulica since NATO began bombing. With over 30 dead, this small
town has lost the most people per capita in Yugoslavia. It has lost
more people than Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital of 2 million which
again was plunged into darkness Monday night when NATO bombs hit
the city's electrical grid.
</P>
<P>
   While the people of Surdulica accused NATO of cravenly targeting
them, they got no sympathy from Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials insisted that none of its missiles went astray
over the last two days. NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said that the
bridge bombed in Varvarin on Sunday was a legitimate military
target because it was used as a supply line to Yugoslav forces in
Kosovo. Residents said the bridge was full of pedestrians and cars
because Sunday is market day in the town. NATO military spokesman
Konrad Freytag said NATO pilots bombed a military barracks and
ammunition dump here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But as rescue workers here paused in their efforts to find more
bodies, they said NATO was lying.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no military targets here. Just old people, sick
people, refugees,'' said Alexander Milanov, 45, a civil defense
volunteer covered with dust. ``This is a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Dusan Petkovic, a teacher, said it was an insult to the dead to
suggest they were used as human shields for Yugoslav troops. He
said the army barracks was 2 1/2 miles away. Besides, said
Petkovic, NATO had bombed the town before.
</P>
<P>
   That refugees were victims Monday was seen as ironic by Serbs,
who complain that while NATO was willing to go to war with
Yugoslavia over the forced expulsion of ethnic Albanians, no one
did anything as 500,000 Serbs were forced out of Croatia in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wanted to bomb Croatia,'' Petkovic said bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   Bratislav Ristic, the local civil defense director, said about
100 people lived at the quiet sanitarium complex that is set in
some woods here on the outskirts of town. He said 16 people were
killed when at least two NATO missiles slammed into two of the
seven buildings on the property. He said another five people were
buried under the rubble. More than 40 others were injured, five
critically, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside one of the two buildings that took direct hits, the
bodies of four elderly people were lined up on stretchers. Rigor
mortis had set in and one of the women's arm was rigidly aloft, her
finger pointed almost accusingly. Police lined one side of the
complex, barring reporters from straying away from the bombing
site.
</P>
<P>
   Outside a second building, seven other bodies lay on stretchers,
some of them badly mutilated. One of the dead was Bosiljka
Malobabic, who settled here after being forced out of Croatia in
1995 with her three children. The bodies of two of her children,
16-year-old Milena and 17-year-old Rade, were barely visible about
50 yards away, crushed under the roof that fell in on them. Only
18-year-old Milan survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milena was a lovely girl,'' said Petkovic, who taught the
Malobabic children, as he thumbed through one of Milena's chemistry
textbooks, which was part of the rubble strewn across the grounds.
``She worked in a local cafe. They escaped dying in Croatia, only
to die like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The force of the explosion sheared off the tops of trees and
sprayed other trees with clothing. Shirts, pants and stockings hung
from evergreen trees, 50 feet in the air, like Christmas tree
ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Srboljub Aleksic, 60, the sanitarium director, stood amid
the wreckage, accusing NATO of engaging in the war crimes it is so
quick to accuse his president, Slobodan Milosevic, of committing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This building is a hospital. There is a Red Cross sign on the
roof,'' he said. ``For NATO to say it didn't know this is a place
for sick people is a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   The injured were evacuated just down the road to a decrepit
hospital that has no water and intermittant electricity. Dr.
Slavojub Cvetkovic said his hospital was without water because NATO
planes had bombed the town's waterworks three days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if some of the injured could die because of the lack of
water and electricity, Cvetkovic shrugged. He glanced at
65-year-old Mile Tepsic, who lay unconscious, an intravenous drip
the only treatment available to the old man, and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's office issued a statement Monday saying that
``massacres and crimes'' like the bombing of Surdulica ``are
undermining the resumed peace efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday in Bonn, Russian Balkans envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin is
expected to meet for more talks with US deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbot and Finnish President Maarti Ahtisaari. Chernomyrdin
and Ahtisaari are expected in Belgrade on Wednesday for talks with
Milosevic, whose aides insist he has been sending signals that he
is ready to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In Surdulica, people hope a compromise is in the offing, because
people like Momcilo Bogdanovic are tired of digging their neighbors
out of rubble. Bogdanovic said he rushed to the scene and was
chilled by the sounds of people ``screaming under the concrete.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogdanovic, an engineer for a construction company, said, ``I
was hoping finally I would start building homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bogdanovic continued to forage for bodies under a
destroyed one.

CELEBRATORY MOOD ENVELOPS TEXAS CAPITOL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ From high anxieties over the fate of pet bills
to the euphoric giddiness of sleep deprivation, the final days of
the 76th Texas Legislature rocked like an emotional roller-coaster
that ground to a halt Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days before allies and adversaries ultimately bid
each other farewell, a celebratory mood enveloped the Capitol as
strains of mariachi music rose through the rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators gave a standing ovation to Gov. George W. Bush at a
fajita lunch under a blue-and-white striped canopy on the front
lawn of the Governor's Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like the flame and you all are the moths,'' Bush told
reporters as festivities began and a clutch of television cameras
followed his every move. As photo opportunities go, this one proved
ample with Bush working the crowd of state politicians and national
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's human nature when people are excited about the potential
prospect of their governor running for president to basically try
to say that everything has presidential overtones,'' said Bush's
spokeswoman Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think if the sun comes up tomorrow someone will probably
say it's because Gov. Bush is running for president. We all know it
would have come up tomorrow anyway, but ... ''
</P>
<P>
   In certain respects, partisan clashes were more apparent during
a session that careened between powerful feelings on hate crimes,
parental notifications for teens seeking abortions, school vouchers
and tax-cutting zeal.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the previous session, however, this one had no match for
the infamous Memorial Day Massacre of 1997 when Rep. Arlene
Wohlgemuth, R-Burleson, killed the remaining bills on the day's
calendar in retaliation for the same fate on a parental
notification bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of partisan activity, more so than I've ever
seen. But in the end people seemed to be in good moods, happy to be
going home and proud of their accomplishments,'' said Rep. Elliott
Naishtat, D-Austin, chairman of the House Human Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   When the Texas House reconvened after lunch, female members of
both parties joined ranks to put their sometimes puffed-up male
colleagues in place. They gathered around Speaker Pete Laney,
D-Hale Center, hoisting cigars and then proceeded on their ``cigar
strut'' through the chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get even with the guys,'' Wohlgemuth said.
</P>
<P>
   Goofiness was in high gear, too, as Rep. Bob Hunter, R-Abilene,
distributed a list of little-known facts about House members.
Several, one discovers, have celebrity connections.
</P>
<P>
   The bespectacled Anna Mowery, R-Fort Worth, once jitterbugged
with Larry Hagman of ``Dallas fame. Naishtat once had a date with
Leslie Gore, famous for the pop tune, ``It's My Party and I'll Cry
if I Want To.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wolens, D-Dallas, who was accused by an anti-abortion
lobbyist this session of ``hoodwinking'' colleagues, does turn out
to have some talent at sleight of hand. Wolens, 48, performed a
magic act for President Lyndon B. Johnson as a kid back in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Other facts might better have been left untold. Leticia Van de
Putte, D-San Antonio, takes ``long, hot, soothing bubble baths''
and watches the Public Education Committee on television. Dawnna
Dukes, D-Austin, admits to having one birthmark shaped like an
angel and another like a hamburger. And, does anyone really want to
know that Toby Goodman, R-Arlington, claims to have once kidnapped
a buffalo?
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the session, talk buzzed about the fact that
conservative Republican Rep. Talmadge Heflin of Houston had refused
a haircut since last July when he didn't like the results. The
hefty-bodied Heflin with fading blonde locks touching his
shoulders, however, looked more like something out of the
Elizabethan era than the hippie one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another reason for them to harass me,'' he said.
``They always found plenty, so it's no difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of lawmakers sported new looks, whether by design or spoof.
Rep. Ron Wilson, D-Houston, spent much of the session wearing dark
glasses in both chambers.
</P>
<P>
   The photogenic Republican Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, however, wasn't
so sure he liked being shown wearing lacy ruffles and disco-dancing
garb as ``Austin Perry'' in a movie poster with '60s slogans such
as ``Groovy Baby'' _ a takeoff on the Austin Powers movies. Perry
offered Monday that the look comes about 30 years too late.
</P>
<P>
   Perry wasn't the only politician whose image underwent brilliant
transformations by Mark Loeffler, aide to Sen. Mike Jackson, R-La
Porte, who runs a company called Quantum Graphics. For a look at
``Senate Wars: Vouchers II, The Phantom Menace,'' starring Bush and
Republican Sens. Florence Shapiro of Plano, Teel Bivens of Amarillo
and Bill Ratliff of Mount Pleasant, visit the Web site at
www.onr.com/user/leff/images/movies.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, who was at the forefront of several legislative
skirmishes, also shows up on Cameron Diaz's body in a slinky little
dress. She gets top billing in ``There's Something about Flo'' _ a
story about men and commitment.

10 YEARS LATER, HINTS OF MORE FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Ten years since tanks rumbled and fired down the
Avenue of Everlasting Peace, killing at least hundreds of
reform-minded protesters, China is in many ways a freer place than
it was _ thanks to the same ruling party that crushed those who
dared to demand change.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the anniversary of the June 4, 1989, massacre,
most Chinese people prefer not to talk about it, children too young
to remember are not told what happened, and democracy activists
remain exiled, jailed or under surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities made sure there would be no significant memorials on
the anniversary by hauling off at least 50 dissidents in the last
few weeks, cutting off reception of most foreign and cable TV
channels, ordering news blocked to pager systems and computer
networks, and boarding up Tiananmen Square with the excuse that it
needs renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Even without such measures, after a decade of anti-June 4
propaganda and steady changes in everyday life, it is unclear how
many would have taken the chance to commemorate the date.
Dissidents still committed to ideals of political freedom say that
the masses support them, but that the government terrorized them
into silence in 1989 _ and has bought their quiescence with
gradually rising incomes.
</P>
<P>
   But those are not the only reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the demands of the student-led demonstrators in
Tiananmen Square _ with the notable exceptions of democracy and
full political freedoms _ have been met in the last decade by a
Communist Party resolved on doing what it must to keep its
half-century hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty once inspired obedience to the party. But the days of an
unquestioning Chinese public cut off from other influences are
over, and the Tiananmen massacre exposed a brute force that shocked
many party members who had been true believers. For a variety of
reasons, the leadership has had to change with the times.
</P>
<P>
   The Tiananmen Square protesters _ who at their peak drew 1
million to the streets of the capital and millions more in about 80
cities nationwide _ were demanding not only democracy, but
practical reform: a more accountable government, a crackdown on
corruption and nepotism, a halt to inflation, a purge of
conservative leaders, the freedom to choose one's job, and greater
freedom of ideas. In differing degrees, they have gotten most of
those demands, making the movement a backdoor success, despite its
brutal suppression.
</P>
<P>
   At Beijing University, the hotbed of student activism, many
young people today echo the thoughts of a 20-year-old life sciences
student surnamed Chu, who reflected recently on the upcoming
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what students wanted 10 years ago, we have gained
since then. Economically, China has turned a planned economy to
more of a market economy, and our system is more connected to the
global economy. Politically, we have . . . more freedoms and
rights. The government is doing anticorruption work, making
reforms, and working hard,'' Chu said. ``I cannot say everything is
perfect, but we are going in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   It is often forgotten that Tiananmen protesters did not demand
the overthrow of the government, and even many dissidents say they
would prefer the Communist Party to reform itself to ensure smooth,
peaceful change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the government had some ability to change and would
have to reform because of pressure from the people,'' said Jiang
Qisheng, a former June 4th student leader at People's University.
Jiang spoke with the Globe two days before he was detained,
apparently in a pre-anniversary sweep of dissidents, and his family
says he has been incommunicado since May 18.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International has documented 241 people still imprisoned
for June 4th activities, but said the true figure is much higher.
And a Hong Kong human rights group estimated that 2,000 are still
in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Its intolerance for dissent notwithstanding, the government has
reformed in many ways in the aftermath of the crackdown. The party
launched a tough antigraft campaign _ the original demand of
Tiananmen protesters _ that has punished hundreds of thousands of
officials in the last decade, with some even sentenced to death.
People are no longer assigned jobs, inflation was reined in, and
ideas and books that do not openly flaunt party authority are
generally tolerated. Most important, most wallets are fatter.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the price of these changes has been a tacit agreement not to
question the party, and to accept its view that limits on freedom
ensure stability and are in China's best interest. It is an
oft-repeated scene here that China would have followed the former
Soviet Union _ political and economic chaos _ if Tiananmen
protesters had introduced democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang insisted, however, that there are ``potentially more
people to support the movement today, but they wouldn't come onto
the streets now, (except) maybe if the economy collapsed. First
they'd come for jobs, then for democracy. People do want more
money,'' he added, ``but they want more freedom, too. The two are
not contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   The government, meanwhile, has undertaken some reforms that are
boosting its legitimacy, but which in time could undermine its
authority. It has modernized the legal system, retired laws against
``counterrevolutionary'' crimes, and given citizens leeway to sue
if they face official abuse. Village elections have been gradually
introduced nationwide, bringing the power of the vote and a
more-accountable government to an estimated 600 million of China's
1.3 billion citizens _ even though for now, most candidates remain
party members. Beijing signed the UN charter on civil and political
rights, and although it is not observing it yet, it might have to
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   There are continual fits and starts, however, as the government
wrestles with how much freedom is too much. Internet access is
widespread in urban China, but Web sites perceived as
controversial, including the Boston Globe's, are often blocked.
Ideas can be discussed freely at home, but magazines that delve too
much into politics are censored or shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Dissidents were allowed last year to register the China
Democracy Party _ the first opposition party since the communist
revolution. But the party was soon outlawed and its three top
leaders sentenced in summary trials to 11- and 13-year prison
terms. Three other Democracy Party leaders were allowed to campaign
for local Beijing elections to the National People's Congress last
fall, but they say authorities followed them and confiscated their
brochures.
</P>
<P>
   Due to halting progress, however, the public seems less likely
to run to the ramparts for June 4th-style ``radicals.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is not to say that 10 years after Tiananmen, China is a
nation of satisfied customers. On the contrary; there are more
protests than ever before, though none as big or as potentially
destabilizing as the Tiananmen movement.
</P>
<P>
   Academics, labor leaders, and independent groups record nearly
daily protests across China, most related to livelihood issues.
There are tens of millions of jobless, pensioners without support
checks, farmers locked in land and resource disputes, and peasants
fighting high taxes. And there are those who hate the government,
but most are too terrified to protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so afraid of the government, we don't want to say
anything about politics. We're weak, we're scared,'' cried a
64-year-old food vendor, dropping to her knees and sobbing..
</P>
<P>
   The woman's friend said she was beaten by authorities during the
Tiananmen demonstration. Because of legal freedoms granted since
the protest,the woman is trying to sue for damages in local court.
But in a sign of lingering official paranoia about dissent and a
free press, the woman's conversation was monitored by two
plainclothes security officers following this reporter around town.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance of dissidents has increased before the anniversary,
with some detained or kept under house arrest and others followed.
About 10 plainclothes officers trailed two leaders of the banned
China Democracy Party and the wife of a jailed founder of the party
to a recent lunchtime interview _ and arranged with the restaurant
for a special room to be used. But that did not stop the dissidents
from speaking their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the current government could reform itself, that would be
best,'' said Zha Jianguo, 48, a vice chairman of the outlawed party
and a Communist Party cadre until he quit over June 4th. ``As soon
as people are not scared and pressured by the government, they will
stand up and ask for democracy. Maybe in three years, maybe five
years. Definitely within 10 years.''

BUSH HONORS MEDAL OF HONOR WINNERS FROM TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In comments both patriotic and presidential,
Gov. George W. Bush told a Memorial Day audience at the Texas State
Cemetery on Monday that America owes its heroes a commitment to
preserve what many of them died for.
</P>
<P>
   While a campaign consultant shot video footage that may later be
used in his White House campaign, the governor dedicated a monument
to 83 Medal of Honor winners from Texas and presented a special
citation to the survivors of a fallen World War II hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``New threats are replacing old enemies. Unstable dictators seek
weapons of mass destruction. Regional power grabs become global
crises,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is still America that preserves the peace. Our nation
still determines the future of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Several national reporters covered Bush's appearance, which came
on the last day of a mostly successful legislative session and may
have been a warm-up for the Republican governor's first
out-of-state presidential campaign trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I begin to move around, I'm going to start talking about
foreign policy, how the military relates to diplomacy, the need to
make sure that we have a strong and vibrant military,'' Bush told
reporters later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can either seize the moment as we head into an uncertain
century, or we can shirk from duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is scheduled to begin a campaign swing to Iowa and New
Hampshire on June 12, is still developing his foreign policy
credentials. Just last week, he jumped into an international
controversy by criticizing the Clinton administration's response to
reports of Chinese spying.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the governor said he was honored to ``shake the hand
of freedom's heroes'' and remember how liberty has been ``measured
in young lives that ended so suddenly, so tragically, so very far
from home.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States needed a ``clear military mission in
times of crisis'' and must resolve ``never to multiply our missions
while cutting our capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush posthumously presented the Texas Legislative Medal of Honor
to First Lt. Jack Llewellyn Knight, a Texas Army National Guard
officer from Garner in Parker County, who was killed in Burma in
1945.
</P>
<P>
   Bush presented the medal to Knight's brother, Bill Knight of
Mineola, and sister, June Knight Campbell of Weatherford.

YELTSIN NAMES TWO REFORMERS TO TOP ECONOMIC POSTS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin placed two familiar and
reform-minded fiscal experts in top economic posts on Monday, but
after a week of brutal infighting among his closest advisers the
question of who really controls his latest government seemed no
clearer than before.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin appointed Viktor Khristenko, a deputy prime minister
until last August's fiscal collapse, to the new post of first
deputy prime minister for Macroeconomics and Financial Policy. He
named Mikhail Zadornov, the finance minister until this past month,
to be the government's special negotiator with the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Both appointments seemed to have been sought by Yeltsin's latest
prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, who has been locked in a bitter _
and losing _ battle with rival political forces to place loyalists
in senior government jobs. Many of the jobs with direct control
over money and fiscal policy appear to have been filled not by
Stepashin's allies, but by people tied to Boris Berezovsky, the
supposed billionaire businessman and an on-and-off intimate of the
Yeltsin family.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Stepashin's own future seemed in some doubt last Friday
when his highest-ranking appointee, Zadornov, abruptly quit the
macroeconomics and fiscal policy post. Zadornov said that Yeltsin
had refused to give him the authority he needed to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   That sparked a weekend of furious and nearly unanimous attacks
on Yeltsin, in which he was accused of handing the keys to the
treasury to Berezovsky's clique and of sacrificing his own place in
history as the father of Russian democracy.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Stepashin tried to declare the entire affair over,
saying, ``There will be no more sudden resignations.'' Yeltsin's
spokesman, Dimitry Yakushkin, called speculation over the power
struggle an ``absolutely artificial polemic'' and said the new
appointments should put an end to it.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview on Monday with the newspaper Izvestia,
Zadornov seemed to suggest that a struggle for control not only
existed, but had yet to end.
</P>
<P>
   With Stepashin's appointment to succeed Yegeny Primakov as prime
minister, he was quoted as saying, ``here was a unique chance to
resolve the political crisis and begin effective work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But subsequent events have nullified the political
achievements,'' he said. ``It is Stepashin who is preventing the
situation from sliding into deeper crisis, the end of which no one
can now foresee. We are under the impression of only one, albeit
tumultuous, week. Final assessments and conclusions should not be
made hastily.''
</P>
<P>
   With the completion of Stepashin's Cabinet, analysts said, the
question now becomes which of the government's top economic
advisers will end up with the lion's share of authority.
</P>
<P>
   Khristenko shares that power with another first deputy prime
minister, Nikolai Aksyonenko, who formally is in charge of
industrial policy but who already has said that he will exercise
full control of economic policy. Aksyonenko, until recently the
railways minister, is regarded by political handicappers as an ally
of Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcements should please Western lenders, who are
still trying to negotiate repayment of billions of dollars in
Russian and Soviet debt as well as new loans intended to keep
Russia afloat until its economy improves. Zadornov already has been
handling the major negotiations with the International Monetary
Fund. Khristenko is experienced in international finance as well,
having served as Russia's representative to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   One experienced western financial analyst, Charles Blitzer, the
director of emerging markets research for the London office of
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, said the appointments, while
comforting, may not matter all that much in the long run because
Russia has little choice but to adopt economic reforms. The
alternative would be to default on even more of its worldwide
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, I'm not sure it makes any difference,'' he said.

`SUPER ASPIRIN' BOOSTS CLOT-BUSTING THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new regimen for treating heart attacks promises to rescue
thousands of patients for whom the current clot-busting therapy
does not work.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a ``super-aspirin'' drug called abciximab to the standard
clot-dissolver, dubbed TPA, boosts the chances of restoring normal
blood flow within the stricken heart by 67 percent, according to a
large international study being published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the new treatment represents the biggest
advance in heart attack treatment since clot-busting drugs came
into routine use 15 years ago. Such drugs interrupt a heart attack
in progress by breaking up the clump of platelets and proteins that
has shut off blood flow to a region of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of clot-busting therapy, technically called
thrombolysis, has revolutionized heart attack care by rescuing
heart muscle from certain death. Not only has this reduced
immediate mortality from heart attacks, but it has left survivors
with less-damaged hearts.
</P>
<P>
   But the best clot-dissolving therapy restores normal blood flow
only about half of the time, and even then, new clots form in 5 to
10 percent of patients. The double-drug therapy raised the success
rate to nearly 80 percent within 90 minutes of treatment onset.
</P>
<P>
   The study results ``have opened a new era'' in the treatment of
heart attacks, Dr. J. Ward Kennedy and Dr. Michael L. Stadius of
the University of Washington declared in a commentary on the
research in the American Heart Association journal, Circulation.
</P>
<P>
   The authors estimate that the new double-drug treatment will
save 20 additional lives for every 1,000 heart attack patients who
receive it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one-two punch is much more successful,'' said Dr. Elliott
M. Antman of Brigham and Women's Hospital, who was the study's
principal investigator. ``Not only are a higher proportion of
arteries being cleared, but the arteries are being opened faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Speed is critical in minimizing damage to heart muscle
threatened by a coronary clot, Antman noted. ``The amount of muscle
salvaged is one of the most important factors in determining how
well a patient will do in terms of mortality and risk of subsequent
heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The research project goes by the acronym TIMI-14 because it is
the fourteenth major report from a study called Thrombolysis in
Myocardial Infarction. It involved 888 heart attack patients at 63
hospitals in North America, Britain, the Netherlands, France, and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Participants received an array of clot-busting drug treatments.
The one that worked best used half the standard dose of TPA, also
called alteplase, along with an infusion of abciximab, which goes
by the brand name ReoPro. The study was funded by Eli Lilly Inc.,
and Centocor, which make alteplase and abciximab, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the drug treatments were started, 72 percent of
patients receiving both drugs had normal blood flow restored in the
clogged artery, compared to 43 percent of those receiving TPA
alone. After 90 minutes, the two-drug group had a 77 percent
success rate compared to 62 percent for those getting only TPA.
</P>
<P>
   The double-drug treatment achieved a success rate nearly equal
to the ``gold standard'' of acute heart attack treatment, an
artery-clearing procedure called balloon angioplasty. But the drug
treatment does not require highly skilled angioplasty teams at the
ready, so it may be more widely used than angioplasty ever could
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for some major centers to embrace'' the
TPA-ambicixmab treatment, reserving angioplasty for heart attack
patients with underlying bleeding disorders or other reasons why
they should not have the drug therapy, Kennedy and Stadius wrote in
their editorial.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence may also lessen the need for more hospitals to
develop angioplasty programs, at least on the basis of their
usefulness in treating heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Antman said the drug combination is more effective because
abciximab precisely targets platelets, sticky, disk-shaped blood
cells that make up a major part of blood clots. On the other hand,
TPA works on a clot protein called fibrin.
</P>
<P>
   By attacking both clot elements, the drug combination seems to
dissolve it more completely and quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, TPA has the undesirable effect of activating
platelets, which may explain why some heart attack patients develop
new clots after the initial one is dissolved. Abciximab, a highly
specific artificial antibody, blocks this process by inhibiting
platelet activation.
</P>
<P>
   Aspirin, which is widely used in heart attack care, also blocks
platelet activiation. But abciximab is much more potent, which is
why the drug is often called a ``super-aspirin.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of the two-drug treatment opens the door to a range
of new, experimental drug combinations to clear coronary clots even
more effectively, Kennedy and Stadius said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Brady, the Parade Magazine columnist, was
driving toward his white-clapboard home on Further Lane in East
Hampton, telling funny stories about his rich and famous neighbors,
when his eyes fell upon the hulk of an abandoned, unfinished home
that had all the grace of a prison wing, only with larger windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the grandchildren trained,'' Brady, 70, said sadly.
``We tell them, `Don't look at the yucky house,' but my
granddaughter Sarah _ she's 5 _ she'll always peek, and say, `I saw
it, I saw the yucky house.'''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Ladies Village Improvement Society, which has taken
a hard line against all things neon, and despite town planners who
once tried to stop an East Hampton merchant from displaying
Halloween pumpkins, the yucky house still stands _ both as a symbol
of change in the Hamptons, and as a reminder of the annual ritual
of criticism that befalls this celebrity haven each Memorial Day
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Brady, who has kept a house here for 20 years, said the
questions are always the same: Have the Hamptons become declasse?
Have they been ruined by IPO arrivistes who chug $40 shots of
Porfidio tequila with their Southwestern Sushi? Have they been
spoiled by hordes of ``day trippers'' _ words always spoken with a
sneer here _ who come hoping per chance to rub elbows with Steven
Spielberg at the Blue Parrot, or Martha Stewart at Nick &AMP; Toni's?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear that every year, and then the next year it's more
popular than ever,'' said Brady, who, despite the eyesore mansion
100 yards down the road, declared: ``Further Lane is about as good
as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Propelled by a bull market and fueled by celebrity sightings,
change is rippling as never before across the Hamptons, and it is
challenging traditional defenses that have long served to protect
the Hamptons Way of Life, many locals say.
</P>
<P>
   The Ladies Society, the taste patrol for East Hampton, continues
to issue warnings about hedge heights, but newly minted Internet
magnates persist in challenging conventions with lavish
landscaping. More beaches are requiring parking permits to keep
people away, but more parking permits are being sold than ever.
Rental prices, already steep, keep climbing, but young Wall Street
traders barely bat an eye at $45,000 for the summer season.
</P>
<P>
   Town planning boards come up with new barriers, yet vineyards
and farm fields keep getting plowed under for developments that
look suspiciously like upscale suburbs. Even horse owners are
feeling pinched. ``I used to ride everywhere, and now there's
always a trail _ and a house on it,'' said Nancy Hodin, an
independent television producer.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes the dreaded inevitable: chain stores. In Hampton
Bays, which marks the western entry to the Hamptons, McDonald's has
applied for planning approval. There are dark rumors that Starbucks
has plans for Bridgehampton, and Blockbuster made it into Water
Mill, though this is considered a safe distance from East Hampton,
where the standards are thought to be the toughest. Yet even there,
right in the heart of Main Street, Banana Republic stands proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the affronts, on Sunday an airplane towed a banner
advertisement for a chain of steakhouses past the Maidstone Country
Club, a blue-blood bastion of exclusivity in East Hampton. It may
as well have been Coney Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of money floating around here, and these stores
want to be in it,'' said a resigned Roland Eisenberg, co-owner of
the Blue Parrot.
</P>
<P>
   The money floats in on private helicopters and corporate jets
and gleaming white yachts. ``I just got it yesterday,'' said
Jonathan Iseson, a 42-year-old hedge fund manager, docking his
48-foot cruiser at the Sag Harbor Yacht Club. He downsized from a
55-footer. ``I got rid of the wife, so I didn't need the space,''
he explained.
</P>
<P>
   With the money has come increased competition for cocktail
invitations, for dinner reservations, for parking spaces, for tee
times. Andrew Weddle, 35, a real estate executive from South
Carolina, said the $7,000 he paid for a share of a beach home in
East Hampton is small change for him and his banking friends, who
constantly compare who has the coolest Porsche, the hottest
girlfriend. He said all this while standing next to his girlfriend,
Denise Shannon, 31, a woman with honey-blond hair and cherry-red
toenails. Ms. Shannon introduces herself as a hair designer, and
then speaks of enduring condescending party questions about her
career choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby, don't be discouraged,'' Weddle told her soothingly.
</P>
<P>
   It is all too much for some year-round residents who want to be
left alone, though they don't exactly mind the soaring property
values. ``Yuppie scum!'' roars Phil Berg, 50, a local contractor.
``They think nothing about pulling out in front of a guy with a
loaded dump truck.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Hamptons are under siege from interloping yuppies, it
is also true that they are under assault from established residents
who bicker constantly over how much is too much. Exhibit A, of
course, is Ira Rennert's planned construction in Sagaponack of a
60,000-square-foot castle with 25 bedrooms and 39 bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm opposed to it because it's too goddamned big, but that's
not a very reasoned argument,'' said Brady, whose latest book,
``The House That Ate The Hamptons'' (St. Martin's Press), is based
on the Rennert compound.
</P>
<P>
   But there are lesser known examples, such as the estate on
Wiborg Beach in East Hampton, known as the ``TWA House'' for its
hangar-like appearance. Esthetics aside, many here consider the
house in bad taste because a wall juts from the house and blocks
the view of neighbors Herbert Ross, the film director, and Lee
Radziwill, sister of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. (The owners tried
to resolve the matter by cutting holes in the wall.)
</P>
<P>
   Or this: Mortimer Zuckerman, the co-publisher of The Daily News,
installed a large satellite dish in front of his beachfront home in
East Hampton, which prompted angry protests from a neighbor, which
led to a dispute, which resulted in the dish coming down, which led
the neighbor to commission a sculpture of Don Quixote riding toward
Zuckerman's manse, his jousting staff rising some 50 feet.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the only people in the Hamptons who have never sued
their neighbors,'' joked Jerry Della Femina, the advertising
executive and restaurateur, who lives two houses down from
Zuckerman. Technically, Della Femina is telling the truth. But it
is also true that he once sued the village of East Hampton, and
that he keeps a life-size cardboard blowup of him being led off in
handcuffs for displaying pumpkins in front of his food market.
</P>
<P>
   For all the griping, there are few signs of an exodus from the
Hamptons. The author Kurt Vonnegut, who lives near the Rennert
compound, has told friends that ``the Hamptons are finished.'' He
hasn't moved yet. Nor have dozens of other celebrities from the
worlds of fashion, art, business and film. Alec Baldwin has
practically made a second career of writing cranky letters to the
local papers.
</P>
<P>
   For all the fuss, the old rhythms of Hamptons life endure.
Parents still take their children on pilgrimages to The Fudge
Company in Southampton. The town historian in East Hampton still
leads walking tours by the light of a lantern. Residents continue
to take up collections for worthy causes _ such as new sails for
the picturesque windmills that dot the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   And always, there is the scene at the beaches, still ranked
among the finest in the United States. Late Sunday morning, a young
woman in an aqua bikini and Chanel sandals walked up to lifeguard
Paul Gebbin and asked him to rub suntan lotion on her back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Mexico last week and got fried,'' she said, as
Gebbin, who works during the week as a prison guard, took his sweet
time with the lotion.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't want crowds, there is always peace to be
found behind the tall privet hedges that surround many of the
mansions. This is so at Della Femina's place, just around the
corner from Martha Stewart's home on Lily Pond Lane in East
Hampton. Late Sunday night, Della Femina stood on his stretch of
beach, smoking a cigar, watching his friends enjoy the sunset and a
bonfire. Whenever there's a storm, he said laughing, sand from
Calvin Klein's place washes down on his beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get designer sand!'' he said in a way that suggests life is
good.
</P>
<P>
   Realtors keep calling him with tempting news about the value of
his house, which he bought for $3 million in 1987. They tell him he
could get $10 million, $11 million, $12 million. Up, up, up.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are a man like Jerry Della Femina, you think about
how much it would cost to buy the same sort of place in Nantucket
or some other playground, and you think about being 100 miles from
Manhattan, and you come to the only possible answer to such
blandishments: ``It's fake money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bonfire is burning low, and the setting seems so common, so
suburban, if you overlook the fact that Della Femina's home was in
that day's New York Post, which published a ``Key to Celebrity
Homes'' in the Hamptons. (His came just after Steven Spielberg's
and before Sting's.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants Godiva s'mores?'' called out his wife, Judy Licht, a
television reporter for WABC, after she had run out of Hershey's
chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   It is like some scene out of a J. Crew catalog, except there's a
double agent here. Her name is Jodi Della Femina, the 31-year-old
daughter of Della Femina. As the owner of the East Hampton
Independent newspaper, she's a true Hamptons insider. But she also
has just written ``Jodi's Shortcuts '99,'' which offers helpful
hints on how to penetrate all the Hamptons' defenses, including,
most flagrantly, how to avoid traffic by threading the maze of
Hamptons backroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually wrote step-by-step instructions,'' she said. ``This
is, like, criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Della Femina has her rationalizations for the book _ ``Why
should everybody have to go to the same three restaurants when
there are 200?'' _ but she knows the argument is suspect, and she
expects to pay a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've given up some of my true favorite farm stands, and I know
I'm going to have to wait in line now,'' she saod.

SOX COME FROM BEHIND TO TAME TIGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's too bad for the Red Sox that May is over. There
hasn't been this much fun around Fenway Park since 1986. You know,
the one they still call, ``That Championship Season.''
</P>
<P>
   If you were among the 27,883 in attendance or near a television
set Monday, you probably got a lot of enjoyment out of the Old
Towne Team's 8-7 victory over the Detroit Tigers. Can you remember
the last time the Red Sox overcame a 6-1 deficit with three home
runs, then held off the visitors with a magnificent rescue by the
oft-maligned bullpen?
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have won four in a row, went 20-8 in May, and increased
their lead in the American League East to 1 1/2 games over the
Yankees, who lost to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   What happened Monday should be ample evidence that this is a
team we are going to enjoy the next couple of months. The three
home runs, each of which came with a man on base, were off the bats
of Brian Daubach, Jason Varitek, and Troy O'Leary, none of whom
figures to break any slugging records. O'Leary's blast in the
seventh inning broke a 6-6 tie. Is there anything that could make
the Fenway Faithful happier?
</P>
<P>
   How can you lose when your starting pitcher has his left
shoulder nearly pulled out of the socket while fielding a ground
ball in the second inning, then demands to be left in? Mark
Portugal's wisdom in the situation could be questioned but not his
courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of weird stuff out there today,'' said
Varitek, whose homer also came in the seventh, as a pinch hitter,
and tied the game at 6-6. ``But we kept plugging away. Tip your hat
to the bullpen: Pat Rapp, John Wasdin, Mark Guthrie, Derek Lowe,
and Tom Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough day for Portugal. You have to admire a guy who
gets his shoulder thrown out of the socket on a ball hit back to
him and he stays in the game. That shows you how much of a
competitor he is and how much we're going to need him down the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this luck? After O'Leary's homer, Mike Stanley came to the
plate knowing that the Tigers have not hesitated to pinch inside
lately, but when he got hit on a 3-and-2 pitch by Matt Anderson, it
was the Tigers who lost two players and manager Larry Parrish
because of it. All were thrown out by plate umpire Chuck
Meriwether, who had seen a similar act in Cleveland last week
involving the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably thinking about what happened in Cleveland,''
said Meriwether. ``I'm not. Every game is different. I make a
judgment on a situation as it happens right then.''
</P>
<P>
   Said crew chief Jim Evans: ``Our response is because there was
provocation _ two home runs given up. If not, maybe a warning at
that time would have been sufficient. But in that situation, you're
going to have a further incident in the game if you don't do
something at that point. You've got to take action right there. If
he wasn't throwing at him, it's a bad time to let one get away
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley said pitches that stray are not uncommon after home
runs. He expected one right away, but not on 3 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what he was thinking,'' said Stanley. ``It's
tough to say. It was just the decision by the umpire that it was
intentional. I was on my heels with the first pitch. I didn't know
what was going on. But after that, maybe that one got away from
him.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Sox began May, they were 11-11 and struggling to find
an identity. The lineup was not set. Injuries to Nomar Garciaparra
and Gordon made you wonder whether this would be a .500 club all
year. But they reeled off their first 20-victory month since 1996,
doing major damage at the expense of Anaheim, Texas, New York, and
Cleveland, all teams with playoff ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to come from behind and score 6-7 runs against
major league pitching,'' said Daubach, whom Varitek was pinch
hitting for and who was the first person to greet Varitek in the
dugout. ``But we kept playing hard every inning and didn't give up.
We peck away and peck away and then we got a couple of home runs
for the win.''
</P>
<P>
   The game-winner by O'Leary went to left field and got an assist
from the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the wind was blowing out,'' said O'Leary, ``and I was
just hoping it was to the wall. The next thing I knew, I looked up
and it was out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were happy to peck away. But the big damage was done by
Varitek. I got in there and the wind was blowing out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some strange things early and we fell behind,''
Williams said. ``But we fought back, tied it, and went ahead. We're
resilient. The big middle innings by Rapp picked us up and gave us
a chance to get our offense going.''

REHAB CLINICS IN DOCTORS' OFFICES RAISE LEGAL QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Creative entrepreneurs and some doctors are seizing
on a change in Medicare rules to establish part-time rehabilitation
clinics in doctors' offices, an arrangement that critics say comes
dangerously close to violating fraud, abuse and kickback laws.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, trying to save money for Medicare, Congress
changed the rules governing physical therapy and similar services
provided to people with a wide range of illnesses and injuries. The
revision limited the amount that Medicare would pay for each
patient's treatment and established a fee schedule that took effect
this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the change had a surprising, unintended consequence.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, health care businesses seized on the new
rules as a way to make money by increasing the numbers of patients
being treated in doctors offices even though the per-patient fees
were not as lucrative as before. The businesses sent unsolicited
invitations to doctors across the country, proposing to establish
part-time rehabilitation clinics in their offices.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors did not have to do anything but provide office space
for a few hours a day, three days a week. In return, they were
told, they would receive up to $3,000 in ``monthly compensation,''
payable ``upon receipt from Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrangements, described by one Democratic congressman as
``too good to be true,'' show why it is difficult to control
Medicare costs. In this case, while the fees per patient were
limited, enterprising businesses found a way to provide more
services to more patients in the fast-growing Medicare market. They
simply followed the old maxim that when prices are cut, make up the
difference in volume.
</P>
<P>
   D. McCarty Thornton, chief counsel to the inspector general of
the Department of Health and Human Services, which runs Medicare,
said he had received reports of the new arrangements cropping up
around the country. Thornton said the government was investigating
such arrangements because some of the proposals raised ``serious
questions under the federal fraud and abuse laws, in particular the
anti-kickback statute.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, it is a crime to pay, solicit or receive anything
of value in return for the referral of Medicare patients, or for
buying or leasing any goods or services under Medicare. A separate
law says that if a doctor has a financial relationship with a
company, the doctor may not refer patients to that company for any
``designated health services,'' like physical therapy, occupational
therapy or speech-language pathology services. Those are the very
services provided in outpatient rehabilitation clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies involved in the growing business is Senior
Health Care of Savannah, Ga., which in a solicitation letter
invites doctors to ``participate in an exciting program offered
through Medicare.'' The company says it is careful to keep its
program within legal limits, employing experts in Medicare payment
policy to ensure that it is acting properly.
</P>
<P>
   In its solicitations, the company proposes to use the doctor's
office as an ``off-site location'' for a clinic known in the
Medicare law as a comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility,
or CORF.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to chiropractors in various states, Dr. John P.
Olevnik of Senior Health Care said: ``The benefit for you is that
for every month you provide the CORF with a minimum of five new
patients to treat in your office, I will reimburse you $21 per
square foot for the space I use. Up to a maximum of $3,000 per
month.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Health Care said, in other materials made available to
doctors, that it was ``currently in the process of securing CORF
licenses nationwide.'' Such outpatient clinics are not new, the
company said, but in 1999, for the first time, they ``will be
allowed to make a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   By accepting this proposal, Senior Health Care said, doctors can
expand the range and scope of services available to Medicare
patients, ``at absolutely no cost'' to the doctors.

</P>
<P>
   Stroke victims, people who have fallen and broken a hip, and
people severely injured in auto accidents are among those who could
benefit from the services of such clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Health Care said it worked with a Florida company, Total
Health Care Consulting, to set up the clinics in doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``A single CORF license can have 100 or more off-sites'' in the
same state, the companies tell doctors. ``Only the primary (main)
CORF facility will be subjected to a certification inspection. The
off-sites have no inspection.''
</P>
<P>
   Total Health Care Consulting said in an information package for
doctors that it intended to set up comprehensive outpatient
rehabilitation clinics in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Health Care contends that its arrangement complies with
the law because it pays doctors ``fair market value'' for the space
it rents from them. And it says it does not require the doctors to
send patients to the clinics operating in their offices _ even if
some solicitation letters suggested such a link.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are well aware of the law,'' said Benjamin S. Eichholz, a
co-owner of Senior Health Care.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTION TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers and medical groups are advising doctors to be
careful. The Florida Chiropractic Association sent a bulletin to
its members urging them to ``use caution in responding to any
solicitations'' from companies that wanted to rent space in their
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Downing, executive director of the California
Chiropractic Association, said doctors should ``seek the advice of
a lawyer familiar with Medicare, unlawful referral and general
health care issues before signing any contract or rental
agreement.'' And the American Podiatric Medical Association told
its members to exercise ``extreme caution.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., said: ``The incentive for gross
overutilization of services in these kinds of deals is enormous.
Implicit in the deal is the message, `Doctor, you can make a lot of
money by renting spare office space to me, but I will have to keep
busy _ through referrals of your patients for rehab and physical
therapy.'''

</P>
<P>
   Dr. John B. Collet Jr., a podiatrist in Ventura, Calif., said
that he had initially agreed to let a rehabilitation clinic rent
space in his office, but that he now wanted to wait until the
federal government clarified the legality of such arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is perilous,'' Collet said. ``I don't want to get into a
conflict of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract does not appear to require Collet to send patients
to the clinic. But, he said, after he signed the document, it
became clear to him, in discussions with owners of the clinic, that
``I'd be a source of patients for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, Medicare generally paid 80 percent of the
``reasonable costs'' that outpatient clinics incurred in providing
therapy and other rehabilitation services to Medicare patients.
Federal auditors examined the claims and could deny payment for
costs deemed to be excessive.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, as a result of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997,
Medicare began using a fee schedule like the one used to pay
doctors. Clinics that hold their costs below the fees paid by
Medicare can keep the difference. Congress saw this as a way to
control costs, since Medicare payments would be fixed in advance.
But some businesses see it as a new opportunity to make profits.
</P>
<P>
   Literature sent out by Senior Health Care tells doctors: ``This
is a win-win situation for all involved. The patient can get needed
therapy without having to travel to a hospital or rehab center, and
the off-site receives compensation for providing space for the
therapist to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Under such an arrangement, according to material from Total
Health Care Consulting, health care providers can ``receive a
rental rebate'' while expanding services to their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Health Care says it uses the services of Carlos A.
Carrero and Jorge L. Narvaez to help bill Medicare. The two men
used to work at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, the local
Medicare contractor, which reviews and pays Medicare claims on
behalf of the government. Their company, based in Jacksonville,
Fla., offers advice on Medicare billing techniques to clients in
Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Texas and other states.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Carrero, a former auditing manager at Blue
Cross and Blue Shield, said: ``As a taxpayer, I congratulate the
government for investigating the outpatient rehabilitation
facilities. If the contract or the rent is in exchange for
patients, I have to agree 100 percent with Stark. That's a no-no.
If anyone is offering to pay rent as compensation for the referral
of Medicare patients, that's a questionable practice, to say the
least.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, the new limits on Medicare coverage of therapy
services took effect. There is a limit of $1,500 a year on physical
therapy for each beneficiary and a separate $1,500 limit for
occupational therapy services, which enable people to take care of
themselves and engage in productive activity.
</P>
<P>
   Karen A. Monson, director of Medicare benefits integrity at Blue
Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, said some clinics had found
``ways to circumvent the limits.'' For example, Ms. Monson said,
they may provide physical therapy, but bill Medicare for
respiratory therapy, which is not subject to an annual limit.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Monson did not identify any of the clinics but said her
office was looking into this practice.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Monson said, some clinics provide physical
therapy to the same patient at more than one site, so it is
difficult for the government to keep track of expenses incurred by
that beneficiary.

NATO BOMBING HELPS KOSOVO REBELS IN BATTLE FOR STRATEGIC MOUNTAIN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Unmoved by signs that President Slobodan Milosevic
of Yugoslavia might be prepared to negotiate a settlement, NATO
carried out withering new air strikes across Yugoslavia on Monday,
seizing on a day of clear weather to attack targets from the
capital to the increasingly tense border with Albania.
</P>
<P>
   NATO jets, including American A-10s, carried out a series of
strikes against Yugoslav army units that NATO said were trying to
repel an offensive by the Kosovo Liberation Army, the Kosovo
Albanian separatist rebels, along Kosovo's southwestern border.
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO has not coordinated its attacks with the rebels,
NATO spokesmen in Brussels said the strikes effectively aided the
rebels' efforts to seize a strategic mountain, Mount Pastrik, which
straddles the border between Yugoslavia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO spokesman, Col. Konrad Freytag, said that Yugoslavia's
Serbian-led army had massed troops and weapons and had been driving
the rebels off the mountain's slope and toward Albania on Sunday.
On Monday, the low-flying A-10s, designed to find and destroy tanks
and other armored weapons, attacked the site of the Serbian
buildup.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO aircraft are taking advantage of this opportunity to
attack the now more prominent concentration of Serbian war
machinery,'' Freytag said.
</P>
<P>
   With clear skies and new authority to expand the air raids, NATO
has conducted some of the most sustained attacks since the bombing
began 69 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, endured a heavy night of
bombardment late Sunday and early Monday that knocked out an
electrical tower. On Monday night, two more towers were struck,
once again plunging the city into darkness. Yugoslavia's official
news agency reported air strikes across the country again on Monday
and Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesmen said on Monday that the alliance had conducted
323 combat strikes in the previous 24 hours, the fourth straight
day that American and NATO aircraft had flown such a large number
of raids.
</P>
<P>
   The intensification of the attacks has coincided with still more
instances of NATO bombs and missiles killing civilians. A day after
striking a heavily used bridge near an open air market, killing at
least nine people, NATO strikes on Monday hit a hospital complex in
the Serbian city of Surdulica, killing 17 civilians and wounding
43.
</P>
<P>
   Freytag said NATO aircraft had successfully attacked a military
barracks and an ammunition storage area in Surdulica, but he said
he could not confirm any attack on the hospital complex.
</P>
<P>
   Western journalists went to the scene and reported seeing both
bodies and evidence of damage to the hospital buildings. On Monday
night, official Yugoslav news reports said NATO missiles hit an
apartment building in another city, Novi Pazar, killing at least 10
people.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has repeatedly expressed regret for the deaths of
civilians, but on M Monday, its chief spokesman, Jamie Shea,
sounded increasingly frustrated with the criticism of NATO's
mistakes, saying the bombings would go on undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been engaged in this because the government in
Belgrade has been deliberately targeting large numbers of its own
civilian population for months,'' Shea said. ``We have made it
clear that we would have preferred to solve this through other
means, except the use of force, but we are not going to be
deterred, having started to do this, until our objectives are
met.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest raids, NATO said, its aircraft also struck highway
bridges at Vladicin, Varvarin, Bare and Donje Trnjance, airfields
at Nis and Ponikve, and army barracks in six cities, including
Belgrade and Surdulica. NATO also continued to attack radio and
television towers.
</P>
<P>
   The clear weather has apparently improved the alliance's success
against Yugoslav forces still operating in Kosovo. NATO reported
destroying significant clusters of heavy weapons in Kosovo, among
them 12 tanks, seven artillery pieces and six armored personnel
carriers, including those involved in the fighting against the
Kosovo Liberation Army around Mount Pastrik.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fighting between the Serbian forces and the rebels has
intensified in recent days. The rebels, whose numbers have
reportedly grown to as many as 15,000, have tried to take advantage
of NATO's air raids to harass the battered Serbian units and,
increasingly, to carve out territory for use as supply routes. Shea
said on Monday that the rebels had moved into three towns cleared
of Serbian forces by NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Pastrik is a strategic position, with a commanding view
from the city of Prizen to the Djakovica Valley, areas hotly
contested by the rebels. NATO officials say that Serbian artillery
and tanks had used the position to attack rebel strongholds and
concentrations of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said the rebels were ``indirect beneficiaries'' of NATO
attacks on the Serbian positions on Mount Pastrik.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a clear objective here of striking at the Yugoslav
forces wherever they are in Kosovo,'' he said. If the rebels ``are
able to benefit from that, so be it.''

NATO STRIKES KILL MORE CIVILIANS BUT DIPLOMACY ADVANCES

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ As diplomacy inched forward toward a
possible settlement over Kosovo, NATO air attacks killed at least
another 16 civilians Monday and wounded 43 when four missiles hit a
hospital complex in the town of Surdulica.
</P>
<P>
   Later today, NATO missiles aimed at a local television station
hit an apartment building in Novi Pazar, close to Kosovo, killing
at least 10 people and wounding more than 20, according to the
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, NATO aircraft hit a bridge in the middle of a market
day in Vavarin, a small Serbian town, killing at least nine people
and wounding 17.
</P>
<P>
   Another person died and eight more people were wounded overnight
in Belgrade, the capital, and two more civilians were killed Monday
when NATO hit another bridge, between Leskovac and Lebane in
southern Serbia, the independent and normally reliable Radio
Pancevo reported.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, NATO attacks blew out the electricity in
Belgrade once again. The only lights in the city were from car
headlights and anti-aircraft tracers. A bomb on the outskirts of
the city lighted up the skyline.
</P>
<P>
   The intensifying air campaign, with considerably more daylight
bombing even around Belgrade, is clearly tied to the diplomatic
effort to get President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to agree
to NATO demands over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian special envoy to the Balkans, Viktor Chernomyrdin,
is expected to return to Belgrade on Wednesday for more talks with
Milosevic, accompanied for the first time by the Finnish president,
Martti Ahtisaari, who is representing NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, expressed new hope
Monday for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   And the Yugoslav government, after a Cabinet meeting, repeated
its acceptance of the principles for an agreement laid out by the
Group of Seven major industrialized nations, plus Russia, sometimes
called the Group of Eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``In accordance with our consistent policy of peace and defense
of freedoms, Yugoslavia has accepted the G-8 principles and thinks
a U.N. Security Council resolution, in accordance with the U.N.
charter, should enable the transfer of the resolution of the crisis
from the military to the political sphere,'' the statement said,
according to Tanjug, the official Yugoslav news agency.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly identical to a statement issued by Milosevic's
office on Friday night, after he met with Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   But fleshing out the principles with a detailed U.N. Security
Council statement and a peace plan is another matter. Considerable
gaps remain between Yugoslavia and NATO over the size of a U.N.
security force to protect Kosovo Albanians, as well as its
leadership and its composition.
</P>
<P>
   Though Yugoslavia has accepted the idea of NATO troops in the
force, it would prefer to have soldiers inside Kosovo from NATO
countries not associated with the bombing _ in other words, not the
United States or Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia would also prefer a neutral commander. But NATO
insists that American and British troops be part of the force and
that NATO troops constitute its ``core.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO is also demanding that Yugoslav forces start pulling out of
Kosovo before any bombing halt. Yugoslavia and Russia believe that
too rapid a withdrawal would leave a vacuum that would be filled
immediately by the separatist Albanian rebels of the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is the southern province of Serbia, which is the larger
of two republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of Yugoslavia's willingness to deal, the
ultranationalist deputy prime minister of Serbia, Vojislav Seselj,
said on Sunday night that he would now accept foreign forces in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that is the price we have to pay for the war to end, we can
let up a bit,'' Seselj said.
</P>
<P>
   He still opposed NATO forces inside Serbia, he said, and
approved Chernomyrdin's proposal to leave at least some Yugoslav
security forces inside Kosovo to guard the borders and preserve the
symbols of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The intensifying NATO bombing is increasing pressure on the
government, but it is also killing more civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO spokesman, Jamie Shea, brushed off the increased number
of civilian deaths again Monday as the unfortunate ``collateral
damage'' of war, saying that NATO had aimed at a military barracks
in Surdulica and believed it had hit its target.
</P>
<P>
   But Western journalists who went on Monday to Surdulica, 155
miles southeast of the capital, said that two missiles each made
direct hits on a retirement home and a sanitarium for tuberculosis
patients. The sanitarium also housed a number of healthy Serbian
refugees who were expelled from Croatia in an earlier period of
ethnic purging that, as Yugoslav officials often point out, brought
Croatia little criticism and no bombing from NATO.
</P>
<P>
   On April 27, another NATO attack on Surdulica missed its target
and killed 20 people in a residential area, half of them children.
</P>
<P>
   The injured were taken Monday to another hospital in Surdulica,
one that had no running water. A NATO bomb burst a water pipe in a
field 100 yards from the sanitarium on Saturday, depriving much of
the town of water.
</P>
<P>
   After that bomb, some refugees, believing that the hospital
complex was a NATO target, began living in tents on the grass, said
journalists who went there Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The two buildings are set in a wooded area on the edge of town,
and police officers lined the roadway into the complex, as if to
prevent journalists from straying. But residents said that the
nearest military target, a barracks, was several miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of four elderly women lay on the ground outside the
retirement home, the journalists said, and 11 more bodies were
visible near the sanitarium, where the explosions had collapsed the
upper floors. One of the other bodies was still under the rubble,
crushed in a bed, one hand outstretched. Local officials and the
hospital director told journalists that 10 more bodies might still
be buried under the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Mica Pjevac, a woman in her 60s who fled Croatia in 1991, said
she had been asleep on the second floor of the sanitarium. ``I
heard a plane pass by and then return,'' Mrs. Pjevac told the
reporters. ``After that, there was an explosion. From the wall and
the ceiling, everything fell on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pjevac was trapped for over an hour, she said. ``I kept
thinking, it's over, it's over,'' she was quoted as saying. ``I
thought that was the end of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, after speaking with President Clinton on the phone
and meeting with Chernomyrdin and the Russian foreign minister,
Igor Ivanov, Prime Minister Stepashin said, ``There are signs that
even this situation, which originally seemed to be intractable, may
be settled after all,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin plans to go to Bonn, Germany, on Tuesday to meet
once again with the American deputy secretary of state, Strobe
Talbott, and with Ahtisaari and the German chancellor, Gerhard
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin and Ahtisaari are then expected to fly together to
Belgrade.

 CHINA DETECTS RACISM IN U.S REPORT ON SPYING  (mk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China on Monday issued its broadest attack yet on the
congressional report that says China stole nuclear and missile
technologies, calling the document a tissue of half-truths,
conjectures and lies.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference, the information minister of China's State
Council, or Cabinet, used an Internet hookup to illustrate his
point that detailed information on American nuclear weapons was
readily available from public sites on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The minister, Zhao Qizheng, alternated between outrage and
ridicule as he called the allegations of spying absurd and racist.
</P>
<P>
   In its assertion that China has engaged in decades of successful
military espionage, Zhao said, the report relied on ``terms of
conjecture like seemingly, presumably, if, perhaps, probably and
perhaps in the future,'' while offering no substantive evidence of
theft.
</P>
<P>
   The contention that American security was endangered by all
types of Chinese visitors, including scientists, students and
executives, is ``a great slander against the Chinese nation and is
typical racial prejudice,'' Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
   Like other officials in recent days, the minister portrayed the
report, from a committee led by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., as
the latest blow by hostile groups in the United States who are
trying to sabotage Chinese-American relations. Zhao took pains to
describe Chinese progress in military technologies, saying,
``During the years when the United States imposed an all-round
blockade and used nuclear blackmail against China, China relied on
its own efforts to develop atom bombs, missiles, satellites and
other sophisticated national-defense technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the report concern American companies' hiring Chinese
rockets to launch commercial satellites. The report says the
companies, eager to prevent failures, gave China militarily useful
information on rocket guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Zhao said that when China entered the commercial launching
market in 1990, it had already successfully launched 20 satellites
of its own and had little need of outside advice for its own secret
rocket designs. He also questioned the military value of
information that could be gleaned from commercial launchings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commercial satellite launches require only an economical and
rational guidance system with moderate precision,'' he said,
``instead of the high-precision guidance system needed for
ballistic missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhao said China had never stolen secrets from American weapons
laboratories and asserted that important performance information on
the seven types of American warheads that are involved in the
spying case had ``long been openly published in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   To buttress the point, a Web page of the Federation of American
Scientists (http://www.fas.org) was shown on a screen as an
operator scrolled through it, displaying technical descriptions of
American warheads and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Internet sites like that nor books that Zhao cited
offer the secret design details at the center of the most serious
espionage charges.

TEACHING VALUES WITHOUT TAKING A PAGE FROM THE BIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Md.)  (lh) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's public schools, which taught the Bible routinely
for generations but retreated from explicitly moral education in
the individual-rights boom of the 1960s, are under growing pressure
to offer ethics instruction to provide safe learning free of
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   While the pressure on schools has been building through the
1990s because of the increase in the numbers of working parents and
concerns about the influence of television and music, recent school
shootings and last week's Supreme Court ruling on sexual harassment
by students have given the issue a new urgency, educators say.
</P>
<P>
   School administrators say they understand the need for such
instruction but worry that their legal protections are unclear,
their resources limited and the need to improve academic standards
already nearly all-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of School Boards says there has been a
notable rise in ``character education'' in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend now is that there is no one else to turn to for the
teaching of right and wrong so the schools are being asked to take
it on,'' said Samuel G. Sava, executive director of the National
Association of Elementary School Principals. ``But everyone is
concerned about getting sued for infringing on the prerogatives of
the family. No one knows where the limits are.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is that much of what passes for education in values
today amounts to the promotion of high ideals. These might include
caring and responsibility, taught, say, by hanging posters, naming
weekly or monthly themes or labeling hallways, like
``Responsibility Lane.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many educators say that because there is so little of such
basic value re-enforcement at home or elsewhere in society, such an
approach makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   La Jolla Elementary School in San Diego offers an example. Anne
Slattery Howard, a parent, said that two years ago she urged the
school to focus on character and morals. Now each month bears a
theme. September was ``courtesy month,'' February was ``caring
month,'' and activities and projects were geared around those
values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had many parents come up to me and say they are
extremely grateful for the program,'' Ms. Howard said. ``Because we
have moved away from extended families and children are often not
at the top of the list of parents' priorities, there is no one
there to discuss with kids how to behave. The schools must fill
in.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The principal of La Jolla, Patricia Dibos, said that when the
program began, there was debate over what to call it. ``Virtues''
and ``values'' were rejected as too shaded by religion and open to
objection by parents. So the program is called ``interactive
skills.'' No one has complained.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Schools across the country have taken other approaches. Buck
Lodge Middle School in Adelphi, Md., was honored for its approach
last year by the Character Education Partnership, a nonprofit
group. For two years, the program at Buck Lodge worked by defining
a virtue on Monday, then devoting Tuesday to the telling of
positive and negative experiences related to that virtue. On
Wednesday, a guest from the community explained how the virtue was
important and could be applied at work. On Thursday, historical
figures who exemplified the virtue were discussed. On Friday,
students presented projects.
</P>
<P>
   The school has altered the program but still incorporates
virtues into its daily and weekly activities. It also encourages
students to do volunteer work, like making sandwiches for the
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   But there is competition for limited resources. Under
legislative and public pressure, schools are working vigorously to
raise academic standards. And while well-behaved students may make
for a better learning environment, which probably produces higher
achievement, trying to improve academic standards and create
programs focused on character is not proving easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is about competition and the other is about cooperation,''
said Gordon M. Ambach, executive director of the national Council
of Chief State School Officers.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, schools act in loco parentis, as stand-in parents,
during the school day. But courts have told educators that they may
not foster religion and have made it clear that the young have
legal rights and protections, which reduce institutional authority.
</P>
<P>
   And schools and their counselors have an even bigger job,
psychologists say, because the growth of managed health care has
reduced the availability of routine mental health services for
youngsters.

   Last week's Supreme Court decision poses a complex question: Can
students be taught how to avoid sexual harassment without being
taught about sex?
</P>
<P>
   Debra W. Haffner, president of the Sexuality Information and
Education Council, a nonprofit group, says the answer is no.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't talk about inappropriate sexual behavior until you
help young people deal with sexuality as a whole,'' Ms. Haffner
said. But she acknowledged that most schools did not see it that
way and that the court's ruling would not change that.
</P>
<P>
   In its 5-4 decision, the court said that schools may be held
liable for failing to stop a student from severely sexually
harassing another student. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for
the dissent, said the ruling amounted to labeling puerile behavior
_ teasing, grabbing, offending _ as sex discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the majority, says
liability will result only when harassment is ``so severe,
pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively bars the
victim's access to an educational opportunity or benefit.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Esther F. Schaeffer, executive director of the Character
Education Partnership, a six-year-old nonpartisan coalition in
Washington that promotes the teaching of values, said opinion
surveys showed that Americans overwhelmingly want their schools to
teach basic values like honesty, respect and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schaeffer said other research showed how acute the need was.
She said teen-agers had been asked how many hours they spent
watching television, in school and engaged in meaningful
conversations with their parents. Over the course of a year, the
teen-agers said, they were spending 1,500 hours watching
television, 600 hours in school and 33 hours in conversation with
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is awareness all around of these other influences on the
young,'' Ms. Schaeffer said. ``Parents need some help to equalize
the situation.''

<P>
   Advocates of public moral education say the Supreme Court may
have banned prayer in schools but it had never insisted that
schools be neutral on values. In fact, they say, former Chief
Justice Warren Burger made clear in a 1986 case about high school
student speech that the opposite was true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools must teach by example the shared values of a civilized
social order,'' Burger wrote in Bethel School District vs. Fraser,
a decision often quoted by advocates of education that includes
values.
</P>
<P>
   Objections about the nature of public moral education used to
come most often from liberals who objected to the conservative
Christian bent they detected. But in recent years it has come more
from conservatives who say schools are promoting values like
feminism and one-world government, noted Jay P. Heubert, professor
of education at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in every state, the Character Education Partnership
says, there is some form of character education, often using a mix
of private and public money. The Department of Education began a
pilot program four years ago to finance such projects. Now 28
states get federal assistance for values projects.

REDS BEAT METS, 5-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thirty minutes after the Mets had lost their
season-high fourth consecutive game, a 5-3 decision to the
Cincinnati Reds on Monday afternoon, their clubhouse was almost
deserted, the sign of a struggling team.
</P>
<P>
   Most players had showered quickly and left Shea Stadium. Not Al
Leiter. He stayed and answered questions about another bad outing,
his first start in 11 days: 5 runs on 7 hits, including 2 more home
runs in 7 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are many things the 33-year-old left-hander cannot
explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should have been seven innings, two runs,'' Leiter said.
``It's that close. I can't explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter (2-5) is not the only one grasping for answers. The Mets
(27-24) had no hits and no base runners after the third inning. The
most alarming question might be why the team's starters, which had
the fourth-best earned run average in the National League last
season (3.74), are near the bottom of this season (5.53) when
almost all of the pitchers are the same.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the Mets starters are 18-21. Only one of the five
pitchers who opened the season in the starting rotation has an era
of less than 5.00 _ and that is Masato Yoshii (4.94), who began the
season as the team's fifth starter and was one shellacking away
from being demoted to the minor leagues a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   And Leiter? After allowing solo homers on Monday to Greg Vaughn,
in the fifth inning, and Pokey Reese, in the seventh inning, for
the game's final two runs, Leiter has surrendered 9 home runs in 62
innings this season and has a 6.39 era.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Leiter allowed only eight homers in 193 innings _
tied with Kevin Brown among starters for the lowest number allowed
in the league, and which was one big reason Leiter went a
career-best 17-6 with another career-best 2.47 era.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've given up more homers than I would like, that's for
sure,'' said Leiter, who was rewarded with a four-year, $32 million
deal after last season and anointed the ace of this year's staff.
``The bottom line is we lost and I gave up five runs in seven
innings. But I felt I threw better than that, if that makes
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to make any sense of Leiter's season. After a rocky
spring and his first three regular-season starts, Leiter had
allowed two runs in 131/3 innings over his next two starts when it
was determined that he had a sprained left knee. Over his next four
starts, Leiter allowed 24 earned runs in 22 innings.
</P>
<P>
   And then Manager Bobby Valentine noticed something different in
Leiter's motion as he pored over videotapes. Last season, when
Leiter was pitching well, he exploded through his follow through
with his left (back) leg. Since the sprain, however, Leiter had
been following through as though his back leg was tied to the
pitching rubber.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter was held out of a start and he experimented with a new
taping method on his sore left knee. On Monday, both Valentine and
Leiter said that he had much more explosion with the leg. And
Leiter _ who broke a half-dozen Cincinnati bats with his pitches _
said he did not feel unusual soreness from the new knee wrap.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Edgardo Alfonzo hit a solo home run in the first
and Bobby Bonilla _ in his first game back from the disabled list _
and Brian McRae belted consecutive solo homers in the second to
give the Mets a 3-1 lead, Leiter could not hold it. He had escaped
a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the second with only one run allowed.
But Sean Casey singled in two runs in the third to tie the game at
3-3.
</P>
<P>
   And after left-handed reliever Ron Villone came on for Brett
Tomko with runners on second and third and two out in the third and
threw three straight strikes past Robin Ventura (who struck out
four times on Monday), the Mets did not record another hit. Villone
(1-0) retired the first 12 batters he faced before walking Luis
Lopez on four pitches with two out in the seventh. And then
right-hander Scott Williamson came on and struck out pinch-hitter
Benny Agbayani to end the threat, before pitching two more perfect
innings for his sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Valentine liked enough of what he saw of Leiter to
say, ``He was four or five pitches away from having probably a
complete game shutout, so we'll build on that.'' But the results
were pretty much the same.
</P>
<P>
   Another rough outing, another loss, another five days spent
trying to explain. &QL;

KUERTEN, THE FAVORITE IN PARIS, HAS VISIONS OF A NO. 1 RANKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ These days Gustavo Kuerten is a vision in black and
lime, no longer cloaking his lanky frame in the blue-and-yellow
dazzle of his national flag the way he did when he became a Grand
Slam champion here two years ago. But there seems little dispute
that the blood pulsing through his veins is still the color of red
clay.
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten, the Brazilian who chose the French Open as the site for
his first career title in 1997, is back in the hunt, except that
this time around not only is he the favorite to claim the title,
but he could also earn the No. 1 ranking as a personal bonus prize.
</P>
<P>
   With the major museums in Paris closed by a strike, the best
place to see artistry Monday was Court Suzanne Lenglen at Roland
Garros, where Kuerten defeated Bohdan Ulihrach, 6-4, 6-4, 6-1, and
was the only headliner for the sparse men's Round-of-16 program.
Kuerten zipped through his match with typical nonchalance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if I was a product, I would be difficult to sell,''
joked Kuerten.
</P>
<P>
   But Kuerten, 22-3 on clay this season and riding his cushion of
topspin like a magic carpet, is anything but a hard sell. According
to Ulihrach, the only player left in contention with a prayer
against the Brazilian is Andre Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten would need to win the final against ninth-seeded Marcelo
Rios, not the 13th-seeded Agassi, to reap sufficient bonus points
to also seize the top ranking. But he said he was not looking
beyond his quarterfinal with 100th-ranked Andrei Medvedev, the
Ukrainian who spoiled Sampras' French Open in Round 2 and Monday
downed Arnaud DiPasquale, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-3), 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm ready to go out on court and really show a lot
of good tennis, let the guy respect me more, just go in like a
favorite and win the match, too, not only win on paper,'' said
Kuerten, whose searing crosscourt backhand was so accurate it dug a
hole in the corner of the court. ``I have to win against the next
guy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A banner day for Brazil was guaranteed when Kuerten's buddy, the
54th-ranked Fernando Meligeni, upended 14th-seeded Felix Mantilla
of Spain, 6-1, 5-7, 7-5, 7-6 (7-1) in a 3-hour-7-minute slugfest
that concluded with a flimsy netted backhand after Meligeni reached
match point with another frantic scramble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have Armada Espanola, but we have Armada South
America now,'' said the 28-year-old Meligeni after reaching his
first Grand Slam quarterfinal in animated fashion. ``I don't know
if I am good enough to win the tournament or good enough to lose in
the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just get in the court, try my best, hit the ball harder, run
like a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Kuerten, the 142-pound Meligeni is slight by tennis
standards. ``You don't need to be Schwarzeneger to play tennis,''
Meligeni said.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Corretja, seeded sixth, accomplished what his comrade,
Carlos Moya, the French Open's defending and now deposed champion,
could not: He reached the final eight.
</P>
<P>
   Corretja advanced with a 6-2, 6-3, 7-5 victory over Stefan
Koubek, the 22-year-old left-hander who has dislodged Thomas
Muster, the 1995 champion, as Austria's top player.
</P>
<P>
   Corretja struggled with mononucleosis before the event began and
pronounced himself barely recovered from a bout with food poisoning
on the eve of Monday's match against the inexperienced Koubek, who
made 88 unforced errors.

QUICK RECOVERY MAY UNDERCUT SOUTH KOREA'S QUEST TO BAIL OUT BANKS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ South Korea's efforts to enlist foreign capital and
expertise in an overhaul of its rickety financial system have
become bogged down in, of all things, the country's stunning
recovery from economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Financial Supervisory Commission, the financial
watchdog charged with cleaning up South Korea's debt-laden
financial institutions, announced that it had extended negotiations
over the final terms of the sale of Seoul Bank to HSBC Holdings PLC
until June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both parties agreed that more time was needed, as due
diligence of the bank took longer than initially expected,'' the
commission said in a statement, referring to the need for the buyer
to do more research.
</P>
<P>
   The tortured negotiations stand in stark contrast to the rest of
the optimistic news sweeping the country and are thus fast shaping
up as a litmus test of the government's resolve to continue to push
reform now that pressure in the form of imminent economic collapse,
a sinking currency and a crashing stock market has faded.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also delayed for a third time the sale of Korea
First Bank to a group of investors led by Newbridge Capital Ltd., a
private equity group backed by two U.S. financiers, David Bonderman
and Richard C. Blum.
</P>
<P>
   Both banks were nationalized as part of a $57-billion bailout by
the International Monetary Fund in December 1997 when Korea
teetered on the brink of default.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions have changed markedly since then. Today, Korea's
economy is growing beyond all expectations, and its stock market
hits post-crisis highs nearly every day, as foreign investors
register their approval of the government's reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is improving, people are feeling better and the
sense of urgency is not as great,'' said Jeffrey D. Jones, the
president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Jones said, the economic improvements do in fact
reduce the need for foreign capital, although Korea is still eager
to obtain it. ``When you don't see that sense of urgency, that can
be seen as a step back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining the drive to change ways of doing business that are
decades old, however, is critical, not only in Korea but across
Asia. Japan's seemingly intractable economic decline stands as a
stark reminder of the perils of staving off the problems rather
than moving aggressively to eradicate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's maybe the biggest challenge Korea in particular and the
rest of Asia in general faces, not lapsing back,'' said Wilbur
Ross, a high-profile turnaround strategist at Rothschild Inc. He
was recently appointed by the Korean Ministry of Commerce, Industry
and Energy as the ``Honorary Economic Ambassador'' to the APEC
Investment Mart being held in Seoul this week, an offshoot of the
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum that is aimed at enticing
foreign investors to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   He remains bullish on the region, as he will demonstrate in a
speech to the conference on Tuesday that will stress the importance
of following up capital enhancements to financial systems with a
complete overhaul of management practices.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Ross, like many other foreign executives who have
shuttled between their home countries and South Korea over the last
year, said he had definitely encountered changes in attitude among
people there. ``The first place you see it is in the cab drivers,''
he said. ``They're more abrupt, less courteous than a few months
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, at least in so far as the demeanor of cabbies is
any indicator, there has been a pronounced swing back to old
habits.
</P>
<P>
   There may be some political motivation for Monday's delays.
Parliamentary elections are coming up on Friday, and the government
is afraid of a public backlash against the ruling party should it
conclude the deals before voters go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Supervisory Commission has spent 43.9 trillion won
of taxpayer money (about $37 billion) so far to recapitalize
financial institutions, and politicians from the ruling party are
worried that voters will be shocked to see how comparatively little
money the government gets for the two banks.
</P>
<P>
   The delays, however, raise the taxpayers' bill. After it
postponed the deal for Korea First, the government was forced to
put in another $2.5 billion of capital _ in addition to the
intangible costs of dampening investor sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Both bank deals have foundered over price, with the government
insisting that the banks' assets are worth more than the
prospective buyers are willing to consider. However, Jones said
that he believed that HSBC's acquisition of Seoul Bank would
ultimately be completed.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this month, price scuttled a deal for Korea Life
Insurance, which the commission was trying to sell to a foreign
buyer. Metropolitan Life, the big American insurer, spent several
months and roughly $2 million poring over the books only to
conclude that the government would never entertain a bid at a price
Metropolitan Life considered reasonable, according to one person
familiar with the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Axa, a large French insurance company, apparently came to the
same conclusion. Neither company even tendered an offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of foreign buyers came to Korea at a very early stage,
talked to companies when they were at the very bottom and walked
away with plans to buy that were bargains,'' said Kristine Li, an
analyst who follows Korean banks for Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong.
``But Korea has recovered so quickly, just in the last four months,
and everything, including the perception of the values of assets,
has changed quickly, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Although its efforts to lure foreign capital into the banking
system have been delayed, the Financial Supervisory Commission has
pushed through extensive changes in the financial system. Banks are
cutting up to 30 percent of their employees, and the number of
banks has shrunk, from 27 to 17. About 20 percent of bank branches
are being phased out, and new managers are gradually entering the
top ranks of decision makers. ``I don't think any other country has
done or could do as much as they have in terms of cleaning up the
banking system,'' Ms. Li said.

FEN-PHEN TRIAL TO GET UNDER WAY IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: N.J.) 
 
By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The nation's first full trial of a lawsuit involving
the death of a ``fen-phen'' diet drug-combination patient is to
start Tuesday in Harris County state district court.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is being closely watched because it could indicate
whether jurors will buy arguments that the ``fen'' part of the
combination could cause serious heart disease leading to death, as
well as how much jurors might award in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers have declined to comment, saying state District Judge
Katie Kennedy did not want them to discuss the trial before opening
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with litigation over the diet drugs have said
several fen-phen death cases in the country have been settled for
about $4 million to $5 million each.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer of the ``fen'' drug, American Home Products of
Madison, N.J., met recently with lawyers in New York and Houston to
discuss a possible settlement of the potentially tens of thousands
of fen-phen cases nationwide. A jury verdict in this case could
significantly impact such a settlement, lawyers have said.
</P>
<P>
   No figures have been discussed in the settlement talks, lawyers
have said, but any such settlement would easily exceed the drug
company's $1 billion insurance liability limit for fen-related
claims.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration pulled ``fen'' from the
market Sept. 15, 1997, citing evidence it may have irreversibly,
and sometimes fatally, scarred users' heart valves. An estimated
6.6 million people have used the diet drug combination.
</P>
<P>
   No jury has ruled on any fen-phen cases. A case in Cleburne,
Texas, was the first to reach trial in the country, but it was
settled April 8, before American Home Products started presenting
its case. Although the settlement was supposed to be confidential,
it was reported to be $500,000. That case did not involve a death.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the Houston-area case are the survivors of
Mary Marisa Smith, who died allegedly of primary pulmonary
hypertension as a result of taking ``fen'' under the marketed name
of ``Pondimin.'' The lawsuit does not say when Smith died or her
age, only that she had a life expectancy of at least 50 more years.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are her husband, two children and two parents,
all of Harris County, which includes most of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   They are seeking unspecified damages from American Home
Products, Dr. Leo Borrell, who prescribed the drug, and the M.D.
Managed Weight Care clinic in Clear Lake, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs also name the manufacturers of the ``phen'' part
of the combination, but a panel of state district judges has ruled
that those manufacturers are not liable.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims the defendants had ample knowledge before
FDA's withdrawal that the drugs could cause serious heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   All defendants have denied wrongdoing in court documents, saying
evidence linking the drug to the disease is inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   The ``fen'' part of the drug combination was manufactured by a
division of American Home Products, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories of
Philadelphia. Two versions were marketed _ fenfluramine, sold as
Pondimin, and a purer version of the compound known as
dexfenfluramine, or Redux.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA withdrawal did not include phentermine, the ``phen'' of
the drug combination, manufactured by several companies, primarily
Interneuron Pharmaceuticals of Lexington, Mass. No studies linked
this drug with the heart valve damage.
</P>
<P>
   However, phentermine manufacturers were also sued in Harris
County because they allegedly marketed phentermine to prolong the
usage of either ``fen'' compound from the usual 12 weeks to six
months. Phentermine manufacturers have been dismissed from most, if
not all, suits around the country.

SPORTS COLUMN: INDIANS ARE PUTTING THE YANKEES ON THE ALERT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's nothing on the Yankees' uniforms to indicate
that they are World Series champions. Just the intertwined ``NY''
on the chest, each player's number on the back, and a small ``5''
on the left sleeve to memorialize Joe DiMaggio's death. It's as if
nothing needs to be said about the Yankees' 24th World Series
reign.
</P>
<P>
   On the right sleeve of the Cleveland Indians' road grays is a
red logo identifying the ``AL Central Champs,'' which they've been
for each of the last four seasons. But it's all they have to brag
about.
</P>
<P>
   That logo is more of a reminder of what the Indians haven't done
than what they have. Although they were in the World Series twice,
they lost both times _ to the Atlanta Braves in 1995, to the
Florida Marlins in 1997. In the American League playoffs the other
two years, they lost to the Baltimore Orioles in 1996 and to the
Yankees last year.
</P>
<P>
   But this is 1999, and as June begins, the Indians were
baseball's best team.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived at Yankee Stadium Monday with a 32-16 record and a
.300 team batting average, scoring nearly seven runs a game.
</P>
<P>
   If the playoffs were beginning now, the Indians would be opening
against the wild-card Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't just beat you,'' Joe Torre was saying prophetically
before Monday's opener of a three-game series, ``they put you in a
trunk and drive you away somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   After only two innings, the Yankees and Orlando ``El Duque''
Hernandez were in a trunk on their way to a 7-1 loss. Manny Ramirez
hit a two-run homer. Jim Thome hit a grand slam into the Yankee
bullpen in left-center field. Not that the Indians dared to gloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice, but it's early,'' said Thome, the big first
baseman. ``This don't mean a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did mean something. It meant that the Indians, who don't
play the Yankees again until mid-September in Cleveland, alerted
the Yankees that they mean business. Thome especially. On the pitch
that turned last year's American League Championship Series, Thome
had struck out with two on against El Duque in the sixth inning of
the Yankees' 4-0 victory in Cleveland that squared the playoff at
2-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the same pitch, a changeup, but that one was a little
in,'' Thome said, referring to the one he missed in Game 4. ``This
one was out over the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hargrove, the Indians' manager, wasn't about to gloat,
either. After the Indians had been swept by the Red Sox in a
three-game series over the weekend in Cleveland, he was ``just
happy to win'' a game.
</P>
<P>
   But some of his players understood the significance of serving
notice on the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's always important,'' said Dwight Gooden, once a
Yankee. ``Players always downplay it, but I think it's important to
try to send a message.''
</P>
<P>
   Richie Sexson, their designated hitter, insisted that the
Indians weren't thinking about ``trying to beat'' what the Yankees
did last year in winning 125 games while sweeping the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking,'' Sexson said, ``about what we have to do to
beat the Yankees this year.''
</P>
<P>
   As good as the Indians have been so far this year, they surely
will try to get even better. Before Monday's game, their staff had
a 4.73 earned run average, seventh among AL teams. That ERA will be
good enough to dominate the AL Central, but to improve their
chances in the playoffs, look for the Indians to seek an
established stopper.
</P>
<P>
   For two years now, the Indians have talked about obtaining Curt
Schilling from the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   And if Schilling isn't available this time, they might pursue
David Wells, the former Yankee who is now an unhappy 5-5 with a
6.30 ERA for the Toronto Blue Jays, who don't seem interested in
negotiating a three-year extension on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   If the Indians were to acquire Wells, that would be the Yankee
fans' worst nightmare _ going against the Boomer in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, of course, was traded to the Blue Jays for Roger Clemens,
who Tuesday night will be trying to find holes in the Indians' big
bats. But just the thought of Clemens' fastball had Hargrove
wincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' the Indians' manager said, ``that'll be fun, won't
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's why the Yankees made the deal for Roger Clemens _ to
make sure the Indians just keep wearing that ``AL Central Champs''
logo.

YANKEES' PRAISE OF THE INDIANS HAS A HOLLOW RING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Through grins, the New York Yankees acknowledged that
they were thoroughly outplayed by the Cleveland Indians Monday.
They conceded their own failures, the poor performance of Orlando
Hernandez and their lack of clutch hitting. Nobody suggested that
the Indians didn't earn their 7-1 victory before 46,605 at Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Yankees also think that Manny Ramirez's bat made a
very funny sound when he stretched to hit a low pitch for a
monstrous two-run home run in the first inning. Many Yankees think
Ramirez's bat is packed _ illegally _ with cork.
</P>
<P>
   Asking umpires to check a bat for a foreign substance can be
considered an act of war, and in recent years the Yankees and
Indians have shared a respectful rivalry; the Yankees did not
challenge the legality of Ramirez's bat in his subsequent plate
appearances, in the first game in their three-game series. ``It
looks like sour grapes if you say you lost because of the corked
bat,'' one Yankee said. ``They're a good team, and they beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees think they have strong circumstantial evidence
of cork against Ramirez and the Indians, who have been involved in
bat controversies before. When Albert Belle played for Cleveland in
1994, he was suspended for 10 days for using a corked bat _ the
Yankees reliever Jason Grimsley was with the Indians at the time _
and according to American League lore, the Indians' bat rack was
once full of corked bats, pieced together in a secret room in
Jacobs Field (perhaps by a carpenter named Bigfoot).
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez would not discuss whether his bat was corked. ``Not
right now,'' he said cordially when a reporter approached. He then
turned away and ignored questions that followed.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's home run was preceded by a long delay. Roberto Alomar
pulled a long fly down the right-field line and began trotting to
first base, assuming he had hit his seventh home run. But after the
ball crashed into the upper deck, near the foul pole, Larry Young,
the first-base umpire, waved his arms to indicate the ball had
sliced foul. Alomar thought otherwise, protesting to Young and then
to the home-plate umpire, Al Clark, that the ball had glanced off
the foul pole for a homer. Indians Manager Mike Hargrove replaced
Alomar in the debate. Hernandez stood on the mound and waited as
Hargrove argued with Young.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez waited. Hargrove went to argue with Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez waited, bending on the mound to stretch his legs, to
combat boredom. Hargrove escorted Clark to first base, to engage in
a three-man panel over whether the ball was fair or foul. Hernandez
waited. If not for the fact that it was Memorial Day, millions of
shares would have exchanged hands on Wall Street in the time it
took for Young and Clark to inform Hargrove that Alomar's fly had
gone foul.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, finally tired of the delay, but
just as he went to the top step of the dugout, Hargrove turned and
walked slowly back toward the Indians' dugout, accompanied part of
the way by Clark. Hernandez waited, and good things did not come to
him.
</P>
<P>
   He walked Alomar. ``Maybe, by staying out there long enough,''
Alomar said, ``it took away from his concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   With a two-ball, two-strike count on Ramirez, Hernandez tried
three times to throw fastballs past Ramirez; he fouled off each
one. Hernandez then spun a slider low and away, and Ramirez reached
out and, with his weight off his back leg and his bottom hand
pulling the ball through the strike zone, he flicked his wrists.
</P>
<P>
   Boom. The ball rocketed toward center field, carrying and
carrying, flying over the wall. Estimated distance: 412 feet. Some
of the Yankees exchanged glances over the fact that Ramirez had
been able to hit a low pitch so far and over the sound of the bat
meeting the ball. ``It just didn't sound right at all,'' said one
Yankee, who, like the others discussing their corked-bat theory,
spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next was Exhibit C: Ramirez stopped at second
base, not realizing he had hit the ball out of the park. ``He
couldn't believe he hit the ball that far, either,'' another Yankee
said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Tschida, the second-base umpire, told Ramirez he had hit a
home run, and Ramirez continued on his way. In his next at-bat,
several Yankees said, Ramirez used a different bat. ``The bat he
hit the home run with, it was more worn and it looked like he'd
been using it for a while,'' said a Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Leading by 2-0 after the first inning, the Indians added five
runs in the second. With runners at first and second and two out,
Hernandez covered first on a grounder to Tino Martinez and dropped
the throw, loading the bases. Ramirez laced a grounder past the
mound _ and it hit Tschida's right foot before it got through the
infield. The ball was ruled dead, and Ramirez was credited with a
single, all runners advancing one base. Chuck Knoblauch, the
Yankees' second baseman, was sure he would have had a play on the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Then Hernandez flipped a changeup to Jim Thome _ the same pitch
Hernandez struck out Thome with in the American League Championship
Series last year in a pivotal situation _ and Thome whacked it over
the wall. ``They got two extra outs in that inning,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees took full blame for their loss and gave the Indians
all the credit. And they will be watching, and listening, when
Ramirez comes to bat Tuesday.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fifty-five years later, Murray Gaile vividly
remembers the 123 days that he spent surviving at Anzio, in the
Allied invasion of Italy in 1944. As a mortarman, he supported Army
Rangers who were scythed down by German gunfire on one of the
bloodiest beachheads of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were with them when they got wiped out,'' said Gaile, whose
own unit, the 83rd Chemical Battalion, lost 381 men before it
reached Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But as Gaile, now 75, watched Memorial Day ceremonies on the USS
Intrepid in Manhattan on Monday, bitterness weighed on him as much
as the American and French military medals tugging on his shirt.
``Today, they don't even know what Anzio was,'' Gaile said. ``Most
people aren't interested.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went for many veterans at the smattering of parades and
commemorations on Memorial Day, a holiday better known these days
for barbecues, beach trips and bargain sales than for selfless
courage. Parade routes that spill over with crowds on holidays like
Thanksgiving and St. Patrick's Day had mostly casual tourists
Monday, as continuing sunshine drove temperatures into the high 80s
and many more New Yorkers to the parks and seashore.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer Americans called to serve their country, the ranks of
veterans who turn out in New York and elsewhere has dwindled, and
with them the spirit of a holiday that once saw thousands of men
and women marching down Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan or the
Grand Concourse in the Bronx to cheering crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial Day was created after the Civil War ``for the purpose
of strewing with flowers or otherwise decorating the graves of
comrades who died in defense of their country during the late
rebellion,'' according to the order of May 5, 1868, creating
Decoration Day, as the holiday was first called.
</P>
<P>
   John Logan, commander in chief of the Grand Army of the
Republic, pledged, ``If other eyes grow dull and other hands slack,
and other hearts cold in the solemn trust, ours shall keep it well
as long as the light and warmth of life remain in us.''
</P>
<P>
   His general order remains an implicit rallying call for veterans
who turn out on the last Monday of May, if only to maintain faith
with their dead comrades and each other. ``I'm nothing,'' said
George Arnone, a 54-year-old social worker who served as a Marine
in Vietnam in 1965-66 and attended the Intrepid ceremony. ``I owe
my life to a bunch of guys who aren't here. I can't lose sight of
what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   In upper Manhattan, the Rev. Kevin Devine celebrated Mass for
the war dead Monday at the Roman Catholic Church of the Good
Shepherd in the Inwood neighborhood. Afterward, Devine, who spent
18 months in Vietnam as a chaplain in the 4th Infantry Division,
donned his Army uniform to march up Broadway with other members of
Inwood Post 581 of the American Legion. A few pedestrians stopped
to applaud and cheer the men, who had to ask their color bearers,
wearing desert camouflage, to slow down in the wilting heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to remember everyone who gave their life,'' Devine
said as he limped along. ``We'd like to think that everyone
remembers them, but we're grateful that many do.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Hoare, 34, a Marine who served in the 1991 Persian Gulf
war, was marching in remembrance of his cousin of the same name, a
Marine lieutenant killed in Vietnam in the battle for Hue in 1968.
``We're going to continue the tradition as long as possible,'' said
Hoare, a portfolio manager for Chase Manhattan Bank and commander
of Post 581. ``Let the word get out that the people of northern
Manhattan have not forgotten and will never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an occasion for some ordinary-looking New Yorkers to
confess to extraordinary exploits.
</P>
<P>
   Bronislaw Bartkowski, 75, was one of 16 veterans who showed up
at a memorial ceremony Sunday at Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 3427
in Flushing, Queens. An Army sniper in World War II, Bartkowski
said he weighed barely 98 pounds when he dragged six wounded
American soldiers to safety, then killed five Nazi SS soldiers and
captured their tank. ``My legs were shaking so much I couldn't hold
my rifle,'' Bartkowski recalled. ``Then I heard my mother's voice
whisper to me, `You have to do it.''' His heroism earned him the
Medal of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   But Post 3427, to which Bartkowski belongs, has not participated
in a march since 1995. ``You can't have a parade with 20 men,''
said the post's commander, James Moglia, 52, who was an Air Force
technician at Ben Hoa, Vietnam, in 1969-70.
</P>
<P>
   In Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, Salvatore Grasso, 75, marched wearing a
red blazer identifying him as a former American prisoner of war. He
lost seven toes to frostbite in a German prison camp during the
winter of 1944-45, he said, and has not missed a Memorial Day
parade since.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cunningham, 77, who was captured during the Battle of
the Bulge in 1944, conceded that the marching bothered his feet
because frostbite had claimed all his toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's especially bad that people have forgotten about Memorial
Day because Memorial Day is for the dead guys,'' Cunningham said.
``Turnout is going down. Interest is going down. It's been a long
time since these guys saved the world.''

   TRUMBULL, Conn. _ Julia Toledo de Urgiles lay in her coffin with
her youngest son, Pedro Andres, 3. Two other sons, Jose Francisco,
10, and Angel Gabriel, 6, shared one, too. Carlos Enrique, 11, had
his own. On top was a white T-shirt he had won from a drug abuse
prevention program, but had not had a chance to collect before his
sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   The three gleaming white coffins were placed side by side, the
two that held the remains of Jose, Angel and Carlos adorned with
the black and red scribblings of friends and relatives in English
and Spanish: ``We will miss you,'' ``We love you,'' ``We will
always remember you.''
</P>
<P>
   As the three coffins were lowered into the earth after a funeral
attended Monday by 500 friends and relatives, the mystery behind
their deaths was buried, too.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday at 2:20 a.m., Mrs. Urgiles, who had immigrated from
Ecuador 18 months ago, and her four young children were struck and
killed by an Amtrak train just west of the train station in
Fairfield. Mrs. Urgiles was dashing across the tracks to get one of
the boys when the train hit them, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is sure why they were out there in the middle of the
night or where they were going, but on Monday those questions
weighed on the minds of mourners and caused tension among family
members.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Mrs. Urgiles', Olga Leiva, said she believed that
Mrs. Urgiles was headed to Fairfield University, where another son
and her sister were working a late shift for the janitorial company
that employed Mrs. Urgiles.
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, Mrs. Urgiles had moved out of a Bridgeport
apartment owned by her sister, Maria Toledo, and into an emergency
shelter for homeless families. Friends said she was under the
mistaken belief that her relatives were plotting to take custody of
her children. Several said she had been depressed lately. A few
days before her death, after she complained of headaches and
hearing voices, the friends said they took her to a mental health
clinic, where a psychologist spoke with her and scheduled a
follow-up visit for later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wasn't feeling well,'' said Clodomiro Falcon, a family
friend and a former leader of their Spanish-speaking Mormon
congregation. ``She had suffered a lot in the past because of
domestic issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Urgiles was in the process of divorcing her second husband,
Carlos Urgiles, who is the father of the four boys killed with her.
She had two other children from a previous marriage: a son, Anibal
Aguirre, 20, who lived with her in Bridgeport, and a daughter,
Jenny Aguirre, 21, who lives in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   The Urgileses had immigrated following Mrs. Urgiles' sister, who
converted from Roman Catholicism to the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints. But Urgiles stopped attending Mormon services
within a few months, and friends of Mrs. Urgiles' said religious
differences may have played a role in the deterioration of their
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said Mrs. Urgiles had filed a complaint with police last
year accusing Urgiles of abusing her and threatening the children.
(Police said Monday that the records office was closed and that
they could not immediately confirm the report.) Urgiles returned to
Ecuador shortly afterward, but he denied in interviews Monday that
he intended to harm anybody, and said he returned to his farming
village in Ecuador because he was having trouble adjusting to life
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The strains in the family were evident. Urgiles, upon his
arrival in New York on Friday night, declared his intent to bring
his family home for burial, but after a meeting Saturday with
officials of the Ecuadorean Consulate and Mrs. Urgiles' family, he
agreed to let the funeral and burial proceed in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   At a private memorial service before the funeral, Urgiles, 52,
buried his head in his hands and wept as he said a blessing over
the coffins, each of which was topped with a spray of white
carnations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family, I hope you can appreciate my terrible pain and that
I will think of you always, that I will never forget you,'' Urgiles
said.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Romero, secretary of the Ecuadorean Association, a
Stamford group with several dozen members, said the Urgileses were
typical of many of her compatriots who, sponsored by relatives,
have begun streaming into southwestern Connecticut to take service
industry jobs.

SPORTS COLUMN: EWING, SMITS AND PLAYING WITH PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   af)  
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. _ Larry Bird has heard all about Patrick
Ewing the Warrior, Patrick Ewing playing so hurt he should be in
traction in an emergency ward, Patrick Ewing so bruised and beat up
that he appears to have been run over by shoppers at a
bargain-basement sale. Larry Bird says he's buying none of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of hearing about how hurt Patrick is,'' the Pacers'
head coach said Monday. ``I don't think he's hurting that bad.
C'mon. He played 40 minutes last night. If Rik Smits played 40
minutes you wouldn't see him again for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   If it is true, as Patrick Ewing had said before the
Knicks-Pacers Eastern Conference final series, that ``This is
war!'' then the day after Game 1 and the day before Game 2 at
Market Square Arena here was a matter of splitting hairs, or,
rather, medical reports regarding the opposing centers.
</P>
<P>
   But as their relative or fanciful health goes, so might well go
the series.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Bird believes that a contused Patrick is a con job. And
that the sore Achilles' tendon, the battered ribs, the throbbing
thigh, the knees and shoulder and feet that need to be iced in
wraps and buckets after each game is all as phony as a four-dollar
bill. Or maybe he just doesn't want his players to suffer sympathy
pangs for the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ewing not only played 40 minutes in the Knicks' 93-90
victory over Indiana in Game 1, but he also played superbly, though
not perfectly, scoring 16 points, and hitting all eight of his
free-throw attempts. They included four in the last 30.6 seconds of
the game, and twice broke a tie to put the Knicks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Smits is playing with a broken toe. ``Sometimes,'' he said,
``it's so hard for me to move it feels like I'm standing in
cement.'' He also played 26 minutes in Game 1, before fouling out
with 87 critical seconds left in the last quarter, scoring 12
points and taking down 6 rebounds, 4 fewer than Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Smits was having a tough offensive night _ he scored no points
in the first half _ when in the fourth period he seemed
resuscitated. He hit a hook shot, two jump shots and a pair of free
throws _ blowing by Ewing on a drive from the top of the key and
stopping only when Ewing grabbed him _ before committing his sixth
foul, with his team up by 3 points, 87-84.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just Smits' scoring at this juncture that was
significant, but how Ewing was forced to guard him and was no
match. He looked either fatigued, hobbled, old or simply
out-skilled. Perhaps all four _ and the last since Ewing's forte
has never been footwork on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of Patrick's physical condition,'' said the Knicks'
head coach, Jeff Van Gundy, ``we can't ask him to play the
top-scoring centers for more than a few minutes in a half.''
</P>
<P>
   But had Van Gundy down the stretch considered removing Ewing if
Smits had not fouled out?
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy's eyes grew steely at the question. ``None! Zero!'' He
cooled, and explained: ``He's finishing games. Playing in pain and
fatigue is part of his greatness. At the other end, he made a
basket to cut their lead to three'' _ with 2:20 left in the game _
``and then he hit those free throws. But I felt he has to defend
better. We've talked about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, though, must be given credit for the heart and will he
has played with this season, these playoffs. He is obviously in
agony, but it is subverted for his lust, at age 36, to win a
championship and quiet his critics. Even the most rabid Knick fans,
however, have been distressed over the 13 years he has played in
New York when all his sweat on the court sometimes went for naught
because he was not as good a passer, defender, rebounder or team
player that he could have been had his heart and will been in it
fully from the start.
</P>
<P>
   As Van Gundy talked with the press after practice Monday, a
voice from a passerby said an expletive to say hello.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ewing, smiling broadly. And Van Gundy, laughing, answered
with an expletive greeting and added, ``for making your free
throws, baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy had said that he had ``talked with Patrick about
making his free throws at the end of games'' and ``I told him one
out of two wasn't good enough, he had to make 'em both.'' He added,
self-deprecatingly, ``Now that's coaching,''
</P>
<P>
   He paused for a moment, his thoughts seeming to follow the
departure of this player he clearly has such respect for.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yeah,'' he said, referring to Bird's remarks in doubting
Ewing's infirmities, ``and Smits doesn't have a broken toe,
right?''

PLAYING YEN AGAINST DOLLARS IS AGAIN TEMPTING THE RISK TAKERS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the main culprits in the global financial crisis of 1997
is sneaking back into the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The spread between Japanese and higher American interest rates
has recently been widening, tempting speculators to borrow yen at
bargain-basement prices, convert them to dollars and invest them in
U.S. Treasury bills. The idea is to sell the bills later on, pocket
most of the interest payments and then repay the low-interest yen
debt.
</P>
<P>
   If the yen does not turn against the borrower _ and most
forecasts are saying that it will not _ it is an easy, if perhaps
esoteric way to make money.
</P>
<P>
   But the play, known as a ``carry trade,'' has not caught fire
yet the way it did two years ago, traders and analysts say, in part
because speculators are still smarting from their losses after it
backfired in 1997 and again in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If this bet does go mainstream again, though, it could weaken
the yen and buoy the U.S. bond market, helping to keep interest
rates lower than they would otherwise be.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig &AMP; Co., argues that
if the yen carry trade does catch on again, it could make the
Federal Reserve's goal of slowing economic growth here more
difficult. ``The yen carry trade shows that global capital flows
can be at odds with domestic economic circumstances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the trade _ besides a large enough difference in
interest rates _ is the performance of the currency that the
borrowing is done in. It has to remain stable or weaken against the
currency that the bonds are bought in. If the borrowing currency
suddenly rallies, the cost of paying off the loan rises. A sharp
currency rally can quickly make the carry trade a big loser.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Asian investors took low-interest loans in yen or
dollars and invested at higher rates at home, for example, in
Thailand. Last year, the carry trade was focused on borrowing in
Japanese yen and investing in U.S. Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   But when the yen suddenly rallied against the dollar and other
Asian currencies in May 1997, that carry trade blew up in the
speculators' faces. The rush to get out involved the selling of
local currencies, like the Thai baht, to convert to yen and dollars
to pay off the loans. And that selling marked the beginning of the
rush that forced the devaluation of the Thai currency in July,
which in turn marked the beginning of the Asian, and eventually
broader, financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, speculators began to get out of the yen carry trade
as the Russian financial crisis came to a head in August. The
flight accelerated after the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital
Management, the American hedge fund. The selling of dollars to buy
yen and pay off the yen loans helped send the yen soaring 29
percent against the dollar in two months. After that the
interest-rate spread narrowed, closing the door on the carry trade.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last two months, the spread between American and
Japanese interest rates has widened again _ to a high of 4.42
percentage points on 10-year notes, a big enough difference to make
the strategy attractive once more. With yields that much higher in
this country, as long as the yen does not significantly strengthen
against the dollar, it will be very profitable to borrow in Japan
and invest the proceeds in the bond market here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that it is now the time to put the trade
back on,'' said Jeremy P. Fand, senior foreign exchange strategist
at BankBoston. Yet he said he did not think there are nearly as
many bets on now as there were in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for this reluctance, in addition to the memory of
recent losses, is that market players realize there is much more
risk of an adverse currency move. In 1997, for example, the Thai
baht's value was pegged to the dollar, making the trade appear much
less risky. In contrast, given the sharp fluctuations of the yen
against the dollar over the last year, the currency risks are much
greater. The yen, after falling 8.6 percent this year, has gained
almost 3 percent in the last week and a half, trading on foreign
spot markets late Monday around 121.50 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is investors' wariness about the prospects for
emerging markets and U.S. stock markets in the wake of the Federal
Reserve's announcement that it would now lean toward a policy of
higher interest rates. With stock selloffs still fresh in their
minds, some traders may be reducing their exposure to risky bets,
including the yen carry trade.
</P>
<P>
   James Kemp, the head of foreign-exchange sales and trading for
North America at Citigroup, suggested that the yen's recent rise
reflected this cautiousness. ``People are in risk-reduction mode,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A strategist at a prominent hedge fund, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, agreed. ``People are playing, but they are
taking their profits right away,'' the strategist said, adding,
``That is why you are going to see a lot of spikes up and down in
the yen.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rally in the yen could set up another run into the
carry trade. While the interest rate spread has narrowed a little,
to 4.17 percentage points on Friday, the last day of bond trading
before Monday's holiday, the yen, many forecasters think, is most
likely to reverse course, weakening to a level of perhaps 130 to
the dollar. And if that turns out to be true, the lure of the yen
carry trade could prove irresistible.

CHICAGO MUSEUM REOPENS AND TUTANKHAMEN REIGNS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Oriental Institute reopened to the public this
past weekend after three years of reconstruction, allowing
museumgoers to come face-to-face _ or rather face-to-knee _ with a
colossal statue of Tutankhamen that was made the centerpiece of the
new Egyptian gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The $10.1-million renovation and expansion was undertaken mainly
to safeguard more than 300,000 artifacts, including one of the
largest Egyptian collections in the United States, from this city's
unforgiving climate. Scholarly work at the 80-year-old institute, a
research division of the University of Chicago that specializes in
the ancient Near East, continued during construction.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian gallery was the first to reopen, coincidentally
while ``The Mummy'' is playing in 48 theaters around Chicago. Other
galleries, focusing on Mesopotamia, Sumer, Persia, Palestine,
Israel, Anatolia and Nubia, are to open over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each gallery will have a monumental focus,'' said Dr. Emily
Teeter, the curator of the Egyptian gallery. Gesturing to
Tutankhamen, she added, ``You can't get much more monumental.''
</P>
<P>
   The 17-foot-4-inch quartzite pharaoh is believed to be the
largest Egyptian statue in the Western Hemisphere, Dr. Teeter said.
About 3,320 years old, it is one of a pair that were excavated by
an Oriental Institute team in 1930 at Medinet Habu in Luxor. The
other one, in better condition, remained in Egypt. They are the
largest known representations of Tutankhamen.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the statue was once relegated to the sidelines in another
gallery near a 16-foot-long, human-headed, winged bull from the
throne room of Sargon II, a Neo-Assyrian king from the eighth
century B.C. Tutankhamen was so close to a wall that it was almost
impossible to read the hieroglyphs on its back pillar.
</P>
<P>
   Moving it down the hall to a commanding position in the new
gallery took six weeks. The statue was cut apart between the hips
and thighs, the dividing line between original and reconstructed
material, because it was too high for doorways.
</P>
<P>
   A four-legged steel framework on a concrete foundation was built
in the basement directly below the statue to support its estimated
weight of five to six tons. When the statue was re-erected, it
cleared the ceiling beam above it by an inch.
</P>
<P>
   To Dr. Teeter, it was worth the effort to be able to see the
rose-colored figure from all angles. ``I love the curve of the hips
and the width of the shoulders and the roundness of the head,'' she
said. ``It's so massive, yet so sensuous. It's like a different
statue.''
</P>
<P>
   Admiring the newly visible back pillar, she read a column of
hieroglyphs: ``Beloved of him _ possessor of diadems _ ruler of
happiness, I guess it is _ djeser kheperw Re setep en Re _ holy are
the manifestations of Re, the one selected by Re. These are pretty
highfalutin names. These guys were not modest at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The hieroglyph mentioning Re, the sun god, refers to the Pharaoh
Horemheb, who reigned from 1321 B.C. to 1293 B.C. and appropriated
the colossal statue by chiseling his name over that of his
predecessor, Aye. It is widely believed that Aye in turn had
appropriated the statue from  &UR; his &LR;  predecessor, Tutankhamen,
because its facial features resemble other representations of
Tutankhamen.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it actually resembled any of them would hardly have
mattered to ancient Egyptians, Dr. Teeter said, because
inscriptions _ not likenesses _ identified statues as representing
one king or another.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing about 800 objects out of a collection of more than
35,000 artifacts from the Nile Valley, Dr. Teeter said one goal was
to find things that ``people could relate to,'' like a mummified
chicken and a child's linen tunic.
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, 12-year-old Shaneira Brandon, who came with seven
family members from the west side of Chicago for her first visit to
the Oriental Institute, passed right by King Tut, drawn instead to
a 10-inch-long baby crocodile mummy.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny crocodile from between the fourth and first centuries
B.C. exemplifies the kind of delicate object that could not have
been displayed before the installation of climate control. Other
such artifacts include clothing, shoes, metal tools and papyrus
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of exposure to pollution and widely varying humidity
have taken a toll on the collection. In the worst cases, involving
inscribed stones or pottery shards known as ostraca, salt layers
formed beneath the ancient paint, causing the decorated surface to
flake off.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Teeter said there was not much permanent damage. ``The
desire for climate control was to arrest future damage,'' she said.

SOME EARLY CAMPAIGN DONORS PLAY THE ODDS IN BOTH PARTIES

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Alfonse M. D'Amato and Charles E. Schumer faced
off last year in New York's divisive Senate race, David G. Lambert
decided to take a side. Make that two sides.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, Lambert, a managing director of the Goldman
Sachs Group in New York, gave $1,000 to Schumer, the eventual
winner. Six months later, he pulled out his checkbook and gave
$1,000 to D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Lambert is at it again. As fund-raising gears up for
the 2000 presidential contest, he is among the contributors who
have donated both to the presumptive front-runners of the
Democratic and Republican parties, Vice President Al Gore and Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas. Lambert has given $500 to each of them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being hopefully associated with a winner, early
financial supporters also often get the best seats at the
Inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the people whose contributions will be remembered by
the candidates, and that's what you want when you make a
contribution,'' said Paul Hendrie, the communications director at
the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan campaign finance
research group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for donors to give to multiple candidates
within a party, and already, for 2000, prominent Democrats and
Republicans have given the maximum donation of $1,000 each to more
than one primary candidate. For example, Eppie Lederer, the advice
columnist known as Ann Landers, has given both to Gore and his
Democratic rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   More unusual are the so-called pragmatic donors who split their
contributions among Republican and Democratic contenders. ``If you
really believed in the candidate,'' Hendrie said, ``you wouldn't
turn around and give to his opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   An analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics of Federal
Election Commission records for the first three months of 1999
reveals only 18 contributors who have given to both Gore and Bush.
As the election season progresses, there are certain to be many
more.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, more than 250 donors gave the maximum to both President
Clinton and former Sen. Bob Dole, the Republican candidate, in the
primaries, commission records show.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Gore-Bush donors agreed to be interviewed last
week, many on the condition of anonymity. Their comments shed light
on the increasingly complex interplay between money and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Several donors said their contributions had little to do with
the candidates and much to do with personal ties to campaign
solicitors. The Bush-Gore list is an affluent one, including
Lambert of Goldman Sachs; William Tiefel, president of Marriott
Lodging, and Michael Kassan, president of Western International
Media, the largest advertising media firm in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the donors described themselves as pragmatists who
wanted to be with a winner. But most donors explained their
contributions in other ways. Some simply admired both Bush and Vice
President Gore and said dual donations served primarily to advance
the best candidate in each party.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the dual contributors described themselves as
political moderates who disliked seeing Washington torn apart by
partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are outstanding men,'' said Michael D. Goldberg,
president of On-Care, a cancer-treatment company south of San
Francisco. ``Both of them would make excellent presidents.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ On a sunny midday in Golders Green, Simon Benarroch is
offering lox and champagne to celebrate the opening of the first
office in London of Edward Jones, the U.S. retail investment
broker.
</P>
<P>
   Benarroch, 25, a British newcomer at the conservative U.S. firm,
might seem an unlikely emblem of a U.S. invasion aiming at some of
the billions in private investment to be unlocked as Britons look
beyond the welfare state to embrace a U.S. philosophy of financial
self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   But Benarroch figures he has history on his side
</P>
<P>
   ``My generation knows that when you get to retirement, you'll
have to look after yourself,'' Benarroch said, breaking briefly
from shaking hands with potential customers in this wealthy area of
north London. ``Older people think the state is going to look after
them, but they haven't cottoned on yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The calculation that Britain is ripe for a personal investment
boom underpins this newest U.S. sortie into Main Street Britain by
a company that seeks a niche between high-priced financial
advisers, low-cost discount brokers and banks. Increasingly, the
argument runs, a wave of privatizations is introducing Britons to
investment markets at precisely the time when state and corporate
pension funds and other safety nets are shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw this shift towards the individual,'' said John
Bachmann, the managing principal of Edward Jones, who visited his
first London branch for the champagne-and-lox ceremony a few weeks
ago. ``Those of us who were in the U.S. markets in the 1960s come
over here and see a market that we recognize. It's one that is set
to boom over the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Edward Jones, based in St. Louis, is late into the
game, opening its first provincial office in Norwich last year and
now boasting 52 one-person British outlets, many in the traditional
stockbroker belt around London.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab, the largest U.S. discount broker, acquired
Sharelink, a provincial British stockbroker, four years ago,
climbing into a rough-and-tumble contest. Banks, discount
share-dealing firms and even Richard Branson's Virgin company are
all competing for investment and savings funds that Britons once
kept locked away in low-yield bank deposits and accounts at savings
and loan companies, many of which have now been turned into banks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the mid-1990s transformation of savings and loan
companies and the privatization of utilities made many Britons into
shareholders for the first time, swelling the ranks of Britons who
hold stock to more than 17 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even the mighty Merrill Lynch, strongly established in the City
of London, has gone regional, opening offices last year in
Edinburgh and Newcastle and eyeing similar expansion in Manchester
and Leeds, according to Tim Taylor, its managing director of
private banking in London. And while Merrill Lynch's global asset
management offering caters to a more well-padded clientele with
upwards of $250,000 to invest, some of the calculations about the
future are similar to those of Edward Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it's true that future generations are going to find
themselves making decisions about the allocation of long-term
assets that were once made by state or corporate pension schemes,''
said Michael Morley, a Merrill Lynch private client specialist.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. invasion has added to the competitive pressures on
Britain's own fractured investment fraternity, which is heavily
concentrated in London, and which has traditionally carved up the
market between high-ticket stockbrokers, independent financial
advisers selling pensions and insurance and a range of fund
managers. In recent years, some of Britain's best-known private
client stockbrokers have been forced into mergers, and that trend
may well continue. ``We expect a lot more change, a lot more
consolidation,'' said Taylor at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty at stake. More than 4 million Britons have
financial assets _ pension funds, bank deposits and investments _
worth more than $80,000 and, of those, 1.4 million have assets of
between $160,000 and $800,000, making Britain the world's fifth
biggest personal financial services market, according to a Merrill
Lynch study released last year and based on 1997 figures. By the
end of 1997, this report said, Britain's private investors
controlled assets _ including offshore investments _ of more than
$1 trillion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Edward Jones approach, of course, is distinctive in Britain,
stressing a Main Street presence and local contacts made from a
one-person office, where advice is free and revenues come from
commission fees and transaction charges.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jones, an U.S. pioneer who opened an Edward Jones outlet
in Sevenoaks last year, came from a similar operation in Wake
Forest, N.C., and established himself in Britain, he said, by
``walking up and down the street'', seeking out the nameplates of
accountants and solicitors for his client list.
</P>
<P>
   Benarroch's own operation on Finchley Road in Golders Green is
sandwiched between Diva's Italian restaurant and Co Co's Fitness
Center. But while Co Co's offers ``rapid inch loss'' and ``the
ultimate relaxing experience,'' Benarroch is hooked up by satellite
and computer to the markets and is set to offer ``buy-and-hold''
investments, primarily in British equities, for the long haul.
``Some people come in wanting to make a quick fortune, and we say
they are not the people for us,'' Benarroch said.
</P>
<P>
   If Britons resent the U.S. approach, they are not saying so.
``As a woman, yes, it appeals to me because I feel comfortable
coming into a place like this,'' said Susan Mindel, who runs a
mail-order business in photographic supplies. Benarroch even won
the endorsement of one representative of the British establishment,
Lord Jeffrey Archer, who traveled to Golders Green to inaugurate
the office and, thereby, press his campaign for London's mayoral
elections next year. Pointedly, he noted that the U.S. company said
it was no fly-by-night. ``Those are the ones we like,'' he said.

DDB WORLDWIDE: HOPING TO BUILD ON A LEGACY OF 50 YEARS OF
INNOVATION  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When is an anniversary not just an anniversary but
the start of an ambitious brand image campaign? When it is
commemorated on Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago on Tuesday, an agency named Doyle Dane Bernbach
opened its doors in midtown Manhattan with 13 employees and
billings of $500,000 or $600,000 (memories vary). From those modest
beginnings emerged a shop that grew to 15,000 employees and
billings of $14 billion. But more importantly, it revolutionized
advertising with distinctive creative and operational approaches
that still resonate a half century later.
</P>
<P>
   The successor agency to Doyle Dane, DDB Worldwide Communications
Group, is capitalizing on the anniversary as a way to help burnish
its reputation and stand out from myriad competitors. There is a
particular focus on the achievements of William Bernbach, the
copywriter recently described by the trade publication Advertising
Age as ``the single most influential creative force in
advertising's history.''
</P>
<P>
   By reminding everyone of the contributions of Doyle Dane _ as
seen in refreshingly low-key, entertaining campaigns for
advertisers like Alka-Seltzer, Avis, Chivas Regal Scotch whisky,
Cracker Jack, El Al, Levy's rye bread, Ohrbach's department store
and especially Volkswagen _ the celebration is meant to promote DDB
as the keeper of the flame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to reclaim the Bernbach legacy,'' said Keith
Reinhard, chairman and chief executive at DDB in New York, a unit
of Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernbach belongs to the industry and to the world,'' he added.
``But he belongs to us first.''
</P>
<P>
   The Doyle Dane heritage ``represents a brand equity we should
leverage,'' Reinhard said, ``but a forward thrust is more important
than a retrospective.''
</P>
<P>
   (In the interest of full disclosure, it should be noted that
this columnist played a minuscule role in the history of Doyle
Dane, spending the summer of 1971 working in the agency's
mailroom.)
</P>
<P>
   A centerpiece of the celebration on Tuesday is the dropping of
``Needham'' from the name of the agency, which had been DDB Needham
Worldwide Communications Group since 1986. That's when Doyle Dane,
battered by account and personnel losses after the death of
Bernbach in 1982, merged with Needham Harper Worldwide, a
Chicago-based agency known for more prosaic work for mainstream
marketers like McDonald's. The merged agency did not truly jell for
six to eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any merger putting two cultures together is rough,'' said
Reinhard, who had headed Needham Harper, ``but we didn't know it
would be that rough.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency, by renaming itself DDB, is accelerating a process
that started in 1994 at various offices; for instance, BMP DDB
Needham in London became BMP DDB.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a marketing decision,'' Reinhard said, to play up ``an
important defining and differentiating part of our agency brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Needham Harper traced its roots to 1925, with the founding of
the Maurice H. Needham Co. But with the emphasis on DDB, similarly
elaborate hoopla next year to commemorate a Needham 75th
anniversary is about as likely as, well, the reopening of
Ohrbach's.
</P>
<P>
   The Doyle Dane celebration that DDB is orchestrating includes
giving away 315,000 postcards in cities around the world that
reprint familiar print advertisements for products like Chivas
Regal, the Volkswagen Beetle and the New York Lotto; compiling
lists of the 50 best commercials and print ads produced since 1949;
sponsoring exhibits at museums, and taking group portraits of DDB
employees at what are now 206 offices in 96 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhard has taped a tribute to Doyle Dane to be shown on
Tuesday at every office; he is joined by Maxwell Dane, 93, the sole
surviving co-founder (Ned Doyle died in 1989). And DDB will hold a
party for creative executives at the International Advertising
Festival this month in Cannes, France; Reinhard is president of the
festival's jury.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, only one agency could possibly warrant such a lengthy
list of celebratory events. The war waged by Bernbach and Doyle
Dane against Madison Avenue's conventional wisdom was fierce,
passionate _ and ultimately successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernbach invented `modern advertising,''' said John Hegarty,
chairman and creative director at Bartle Bogle Hegarty in London, a
creatively focused agency in which a DDB rival, the Leo Burnett
Co., owns a minority interest. ``Our debt to him is incalculable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bernbach, as the creative spark at Doyle Dane, insisted
that advertising could be effective without insulting the
intelligence of consumers. The agency proved that bold assertion
with respectful, low-key campaigns infused with cheeky,
self-deprecating humor. At Doyle Dane, copywriters and art
directors were paired to produce more efficient creative teams. The
agency brought a new humanity _ and credibility _ to ads by
diversifying casts to include ethnic Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle Dane itself was widely staffed with Americans of different
ethnic backgrounds, who often had found themselves unwelcome at the
white-shoe agencies of the era. Scores of those employees went on
to found risk-taking, rule-breaking agencies of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, there's a dispersion of creative talent at 10 to 20 great
agencies,'' said Diane Rothschild, a former Doyle Dane creative
executive who is president at Grace &AMP; Rothschild in New York.
``Then, the talent was all in one place.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Doyle Dane creative alumnus, Roy Grace, chairman at
Grace &AMP; Rothschild, said he welcomed the renewed interest in Doyle
Dane at DDB Needham.
</P>
<P>
   ``A horrible mistake was made when they changed the name'' after
the merger, he said. ``It was like changing the name of
Coca-Cola.''
</P>
<P>
   Was there any inkling on June 1, 1949 among the workers in a
walkup office at 350 Madison Avenue that they were starting an
agency that one day would be compared to the world's most famous
brand?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pretty excited,'' Phyllis Robinson, a copywriter at
Doyle Dane, recalled last week. ``There was a great sense of
adventure and freedom, that we'd have great fun without having a
boss peering over our shoulder telling us, `You can't do that kind
of work.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill used to say, `If we really do this right, we could have a
$2-million agency,''' Ms. Robinson said. ``We felt pretty confident
we would succeed, at least up to Bill's goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, she added, chuckling, ``he didn't believe he had
ever said that his goals were so modest.''

BRADLEY'S RUN AT GORE IS MAKING STRIDES IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa _ The man with the perfect resume has himself
in the perfect position.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley _ Princeton graduate, Rhodes scholar, basketball
star, author and three-term U.S. senator _ is the insurgent
candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. But now
Bradley finds himself with only one person to beat _ Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people will be surprised by how well he does in
Iowa,'' said Jim Beres, a Gore backer who listened to Bradley speak
for an hour Monday in a park shelter here in Marshalltown. ``It's
sort of a stealth candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not for much longer. Bradley has been enjoying a media
boomlet because of his unusual standing. Never before has a
presidential race without an incumbent come down to only two
contenders so early in the nomination process.
</P>
<P>
   And with Gore struggling recently, the focus on Bradley has
intensified.
</P>
<P>
   Though defeating the vice president will be a herculean task,
few political observers count Bradley out. He stands to be the lone
beneficiary of ``Clinton fatigue,'' the sentiment that many voters
are tired of the Clinton administration _ and Gore by extension _
after eight turbulent years. It helps that Bradley's own ethics
record is spot-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worry with Gore is how much of Clinton's problems will
settle on his shoulders,'' said Jim Harrison, a lifelong
Marshalltown resident who also listened to Bradley on Monday. ``You
can't separate Bill Clinton from Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Expectations will be Gore's constant worry. He has to win early
primaries big. He has to raise money in multiples of whatever
Bradley brings in. Any better-than-expected showing by Bradley will
be portrayed as a sign of Gore's vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, 55, has his own share of doubts to overcome. He is a
steady but uninspiring speaker known for telling long stories with
sometimes confusing conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is much more of a contemplative figure than someone who is
a crowd-pleaser,'' said Ross K. Baker, a political scientist at
Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's own political history does not offer much confidence
about his ability to win the White House. In 1990, in his last
re-election race for his Senate seat from New Jersey, Bradley
narrowly survived an upset bid by Republican Christine Todd Whitman
even though he outspent her 12 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways Bradley does not offer much contrast to Gore. Both
are the antithesis of back-slapping pols. Both are prone to deep
thoughts and stiff presentations. When it comes to criticism of the
Clinton administration, Bradley offers a mild rebuke of Clinton's
welfare-reform bill. He is somewhat more outspoken about the
president's failure to outline clearer military objectives in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley asserts that his own life experiences are more varied
than Gore's and that the vice president is prone to caution.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley does not get much tougher than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the built-in advantages Gore has as vice president, the
question is whether Bradley's low-key, gentlemanly way of
campaigning is enough to distinguish himself and score a
breakthrough,'' said Dennis Goldford, a Drake University political
scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley insists that he is the outsider candidate of ``big
ideas.'' His outsider status, however, has been questioned because
his 18-year Senate career ended only in 1997. And Bradley has been
maddeningly vague about how he would take his ``big ideas,'' such
as improving race relations and reforming health care, and
transform them into public policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about intellectual abstractions. This isn't a
senior thesis at Princeton,'' said David Axelrod, a Chicago-based
Democratic consultant who backs Gore. ``This is about real life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley promises more details by fall. The early stages of the
campaign, he says, are about offering himself as a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in the Senate, my kind of leadership was to take
big, complex issues like taxes, international trade and
international finance and put a structure of reform around those
issues and then push for that reform,'' he said in an interview
Monday. ``Or I would take issues that were volatile, like race, and
try to play to our better angels.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday in Marshalltown, a city of 25,000 about 30 miles
northeast of Des Moines, Bradley was charming but, as usual,
low-key. In the park shelter before about 40 people, he spoke for
20 minutes, and then sat on a picnic table and fielded questions.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke quietly in almost a pastoral manner that some onlookers
said exuded sincerity. He drew laughter by recounting how he got
picked off first base in a key Little League baseball game years
before in Ottumwa. Bradley's team from Missouri wound up losing by
one run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since that day I've dreamed of coming back to Iowa and
winning one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked afterward whether he could motivate the country with such
a mild demeanor, Bradley said he could rise to the occasion when
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's rhetoric, and there's communication,'' Bradley said.
``The key is to communicate well.''
</P>
<P>
   As he left, Bradley signed autographs and posed for pictures, as
he does at almost every stop. Although his NBA career ended in the
mid-1970s, his celebrity endures, fueled by books that relied on
his basketball days and, less so, on his 18-year Senate career.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who hails from Crystal City in eastern Missouri, has
spent most of his life in the public eye. As a star basketball
player at Princeton, he was a celebrity when he was barely old
enough to vote.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up two years of pro basketball to accept the Rhodes
Scholarship and, after turning pro, spurned millions of dollars he
could have earned in endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate he developed a reputation as an original thinker
on major issues. He was known to listen carefully to others and,
when possible, incorporate their thinking into his own proposals.
</P>
<P>
   /{The National Journal/} hailed Bradley for his work on what may
have been his crowning achievement, the momentous 1986 tax reform
that lowered rates and closed loopholes. /{The Journal/} called his
work a ``stunning achievement,'' particularly for a member of the
minority party with little seniority.
</P>
<P>
   ``At each stage of the tax-reform debate, Bradley was there,
quietly encouraging others, avoiding the spotlight but offering
advice and lobbying key members,'' the publication said.
</P>
<P>
   For years Bradley has been considered a probable presidential
candidate. But in 1988 he said he wasn't ready. His tough 1990
Senate race, in which Bradley refused to criticize Democratic Gov.
Jim Florio's tax increases, kept him out in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when Bradley announced his retirement from the Senate,
some thought he was done with politics for good. But last fall,
Bradley said he looked in the mirror and decided he was ready.
</P>
<P>
   Back then the Democratic race appeared to be anything but a
one-on-one duel. Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota was going to run.
So was Richard Gephardt, the House minority leader from St. Louis,
and Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But then, certainly awed by the challenge of facing Gore, they
all backed out.
</P>
<P>
   His sole-competitor status is not the only thing propelling
Bradley's campaign. In the first three months of the year, he
raised a respectable $4.3 million, far less than Gore's $8.9
million, but more than expected. He has said repeatedly that he
will raise the benchmark total of $20 million to $25 million to run
a competitive race.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's strategy is hardly a secret. The trip to Marshalltown
was part of a three-day campaign swing to Iowa, his ninth, that
began in Sioux City on the western border. His trip to Marshalltown
was his second of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bradley is to make a breakthrough, he has to do it in Iowa
and New Hampshire, or it's good night, Irene,'' Goldford said about
the states that conduct the first two major presidential tests.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the front-loaded primary schedule favors
front-runners and affords challengers little opportunity to break
out.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Gore, Bradley can move around Iowa and New Hampshire with
relative ease to do the type of person-to-person ``retail''
campaigning that voters demand. As the sitting vice president, Gore
must drag along a security entourage that limits his mobility.
Gore, for example, recently had breakfast with the mayor of Osceola
in his modest, brick-and-siding home while his 14-vehicle motorcade
waited outside.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he welcomed the chance for voters to size him up.
But whether voters see a winner or another Adlai Stevenson, the
deep-thinking Democrat who lost twice to Dwight Eisenhower in the
1950s, remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``How it all wears is hard to say,'' said Fred I. Greenstein, a
Princeton University political scientist.

THE BACKLASH TO HIGH CEO PAY: THEY'RE TAKING THE MONEY AND
RUNNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Is this irony, or what?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same corporate boards that inflated executive
salaries to balloon-popping dimensions are whining now that they
can't retain their top talent. Their CEOs are taking early
retirement because they have all the money they need.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   For a couple of years, I've attended periodic information
breakfasts presented by the Hay Group, a business consulting
organization that, among other things, studies and advises clients
on pay and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn A. Joy, a senior consultant in Hay's executive compensation
practice, didn't mince words at a recent breakfast when she warned
that huge pay packages for U.S. CEOs were causing problems. And
it's not just that the CEOs are so flush they're escaping to
Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is it because worker-bee morale is hurt by insanely
skewed corporate pay structures. Big-company compensation
committees ignored that fallout while cultivating pay systems to
reward Fortune 500-type CEOs with more than 400 times the annual
pay of average blue-collar workers. (Just 20 years ago, the
difference was ``only'' about 40 times average-worker earnings.)
</P>
<P>
   There's also a world marketplace backlash. This is a global
economy, remember? European and Asian executives are not drawing
anywhere near the monster bucks of their American counterparts, and
they don't like competing with those who do.
</P>
<P>
   The compensation kinks in the Daimler-Chrysler merger were a
perfect example. Uppermost Daimler execs earned noticeably less
than Chrysler execs in subordinate positions. Talk about difficulty
meshing corporate cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the free-market theory of supply and demand _ which
holds that top executive talent commands whopping pay because
demand for proven business winners exceeds the supply _ has been
undermined.
</P>
<P>
   Joy blamed Section 162(m) of the federal tax code, passed in
1993. Reacting to public outcry against surging executive pay,
Congress decided that publicly traded companies no longer could
take tax deductions for compensation exceeding $1 million to any of
their top five executives, except for certain performance-based
compensation. Companies reacted by channeling more executive pay
into those performance-based exemptions, such as bonuses and stock
options.
</P>
<P>
   But the unintended legacy of the intended pay cap, Joy said,
``was that it sent out the message that, hey, we can go up to $1
million before there's a problem of excess _ so it just set a new
floor instead of a maximum.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this surprises Responsible Wealth, a program of United
for a Fair Economy, and the Executive PayWatch project of the
AFL-CIO. The groups have campaigned for years for brakes on
executive compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Their bottom line is pretty much mine in this regard: Yes, there
are executives whose intellect, vision, skill and charisma combine
to lead their organizations to strong growth and a competitive
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But show me one who's doing it alone.
</P>
<P>
   I just can't see how it's possible for Michael Eisner _ to pick
on one of the megabuck collectors _ to have earned $575 million
last year.

BRAZIL DEVALUATION CHANGES THE TRADING BLOC PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ For generations of Argentines, the
quality of the meat they produce has been not just a source of
pride but part of their national identity. So it is not hard to
imagine the consternation that greeted a recent piece of news: The
country is now importing meat from Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil may be on its way to recovery from the crisis that in
January forced the government to devalue the national currency by
40 percent. But the fallout from that move has turned things
topsy-turvy in neighboring countries and created new tensions and
exacerbated old ones between Brazil and its partners in the trading
bloc known as Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1991, Mercosur is the world's third-largest trading
bloc, after the North American Free Trade Agreement and the
European Union. Since Brazil's $800 billion economy is more than
double the combined gross national product of Argentina, Paraguay
and Uruguay, the other Mercosur members, the sharp drop in the
price of Brazilian goods as a result of the devaluation has
generated considerable turbulence, both economic and political, in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardoso is scheduled to
meet on June 7 with Carlos Menem, his Argentine counterpart, in an
effort to resolve their differences. The timing is important
because the leaders of Mercosur and other Latin American countries
are scheduled to meet with the European Union nations here late in
June to discuss economic integration.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Brazilian meat exports to Argentina has been
largely symbolic. But the more substantive matter of steel has
become a flash point between the two countries after Argentina, in
response to a complaint by a local producer, activated a mechanism
in April that requires Brazilian steelmakers to pay a bond that
will be forfeited if it is determined they have been selling steel
at prices below cost, an unfair trade practice known as dumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some uneasiness about the process of calculating and
determining the margins of dumping,'' Luiz Felipe Lampreia,
Brazil's foreign minister, said about the decision. He described
talks with Argentina about the issue as ``very negative,'' adding
that ``it seemed to us that a decision had already been taken, that
the Argentine side wasn't willing to listen to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Argentina, in the midst of a presidential campaign in which
trade relations with Brazil are an issue, is hardly alone in being
affected by the spillover from Brazil's economic problems. Uruguay
normally sends one third of its exports to its northern neighbor,
but the devaluation has caused sales of textiles, wool and grains
to Brazil to sag by 20 percent, a blow that contributed to a
one-day general strike in Montevideo in May.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Paraguay, the smallest and weakest member of the
group, called for a renegotiation of membership terms and benefits
after a popular uprising forced a change of government in March.
``Paraguay and Uruguay should without a doubt have some privileges
and concessions,'' in order to bring about ``a much more balanced
integration,'' the country's new president, Luis Gonzalez Macchi,
said recently.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Brasilia in April, Cardoso praised his
counterparts for their ``understanding and sympathy'' during
Brazil's recent travails and said that Mercosur was ``fundamental,
a top priority'' to Brazil. But he gave little indication that his
government was willing to make concessions on the key issues
dividing the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a deficit with Argentina, and we never complained,'' he
said, in a reference to the unfavorable trade balance of about $6
billion his country incurred between 1995 and 1998. ``This is
incidental,'' he added, and does not reflect a structural flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil also appears to have parted company with its Mercosur
partners on the issue of how and when to enlarge the group. Chile
and Bolivia have already been granted associate member status as a
first step to full participation, but there has been resistance to
granting similar standing to the remaining Andean countries.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Cardoso's government has begun a crash effort to
negotiate bilateral trade agreements with Colombia, Ecuador, Peru
and Venezuela, members of the Andean Community. In doing so, Brazil
has ignored Argentine assertions that Mercosur policy is to pursue
trade ties with outside countries as a bloc, not individually.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis here has also brought out into the open a
long-submerged debate about what sort of currency policy Mercosur
should adopt. In January, Brazil responded to the speculative
pressure on the real by allowing its currency to be freely bought
and sold in the foreign-exchange market. Argentina, in contrast,
has since 1991 adhered to a policy of parity between its peso and
the American dollar, a step that has imposed enormous fiscal
discipline on the previously unruly Argentine economy but clashes
with the new Brazilian approach.

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. _ On practice floors and inside the coach's
office, Chris Childs and Jeff Van Gundy have yelled at each other
like two drivers arguing over a fender bender. No disagreement has
been major, no damage has been irreparable.
</P>
<P>
   Three years and all those volatile moments have helped them
understand each other a little more.
</P>
<P>
   As their relationship has unfolded, the trust that has developed
between them is as subtle as the difference between Childs'
bellyache on Sunday and his bellyaching of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the fourth quarter in Game 1 of the Eastern
Conference finals, Childs, who had been a tireless defender on Mark
Jackson for the bulk of first half, was feeling sick to his
stomach. One or two years ago, his teammates and his coach might
have rolled their eyes as if to say, Here we go again, another
fragile moment for Childs. And the team and coach would have turned
to Charlie Ward.
</P>
<P>
   No more. Not after a year in which Childs played through nagging
ailments. Not after a season in which he sent a message to his team
and coach that they can rely on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the fourth quarter started, I was bent over with my
stomach, and then Jeff looked at me like: `Hey, don't pull that
junk. You play better when you're sick,''' Childs said Monday after
the Knicks practiced in preparation for Game 2 at Market Square
Arena on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a respect thing. Jeff knows that I'm going to go out
there and give 150 percent. And I know that I can go out there, and
if I do make a mistake but I'm doing it hard, he's not going to
worry about it. Before, it wasn't like that. Before, I was always
looking over my shoulder and wondering about what he was
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Childs knows. During a critical stretch of the fourth
quarter, Van Gundy leaned on Childs, one of the best on-ball
defenders in the league, to come through and guard Jackson in the
post. Usually, it was one-on-one. But when help did arrive with 3
minutes 25 seconds left in the game, Jackson slipped a pass to Rik
Smits for a jumper that gave the Pacers a 4-point lead. The Knicks
called a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so upset, I slammed the ball down,'' Childs said. ``I
went into the huddle, and I said: `Don't come and help me. If Mark
Jackson scores on me, I'll take the blame.'''
</P>
<P>
   Childs was on the spot. Using his broad body, Jackson bumped and
backed Childs into the paint on two consecutive possessions. Each
time, as he tried to whirl around Childs, he missed short jump
hooks. The Knicks capitalized with points at the other end and took
back the lead. At that moment, the situation the Knicks worried
about before this series began _ Jackson's impact in the post _ was
diluted by Childs' physical defense in Game 1. That's the way it
appeared to many, though Jackson wasn't among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you consider that great D, then I'm happy for you,''
Jackson said after the Pacers practiced Monday, less than 24 hours
after he finished Game 1 with 11 assists but shot just 1 for 8 from
the field. ``Good try by him. He played me straight up, and they
didn't want to double. I missed two jump hooks that I usually knock
down. It doesn't matter what kind of grabbing or holding is going
on in there, that's my strength. I'm going to get to the spot I
want to get to, and I'm going to get the look I want to get. Last
night, they didn't drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's response to Childs is not new. Thanks to the $24
million deal he signed three years ago, Childs has a Jaguar among
his cars and an all-white suit in his closet of style, but credit
has been hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like Mark was standing there, shooting the ball by
himself,'' Childs said. ``We pressured him early on. He might not
have had the legs that he usually has if he wasn't getting worked
by me and Charlie. If he says he was just missing them, I say,
Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Childs is never short on clever responses. But three years ago,
for once, he didn't know how to react when he arrived in New York
and was labeled the point guard of the future. Guys like Jackson,
they were part of yesteryear. But when Childs stepped on the floor,
it was like stripes on plaid. Once a playmaker with a green light
in New Jersey, he was unable to blend his wilder side with the
team's more conservative system.
</P>
<P>
   Childs resisted change, rebelled a little and complained at
times. And a divide developed between him and Van Gundy. As Childs
puts it, ``We've had the same relationship as he and John Starks
did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I coach people better the more time we go along,'' Van Gundy
said. ``With Chris, he has a strong personality, as I do, and there
was a natural head-butting. Now, I think it's evolved into
something that's good and workable.''
</P>
<P>
   It has worked because Childs agreed to accept a backup role
before the 1997-98 season began. But it was ego deflating. And at
times, it seemed an irritable Childs was more likely to sit out
with aches and pains than he was to play through them.
</P>
<P>
   But with time, any doubts about his durability have ceased. With
a flair for the dramatic, he can still limp and wince and groan on
cue with the best of them, but Childs doesn't allow pain to get in
his way of running an up-tempo second unit that has given his
run-and-gun style new life.
</P>
<P>
   The additions of Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby are like
wings for Childs. He can fly now, just like he always wanted to.
That approach sent the Pacers backpedaling in vain in the first
half of Sunday's game, when the Knicks scored 18 of their 22
fast-break points. While the Knicks were running, they were also
keeping tabs on the Pacers' dangerous transition game and protected
the 3-point line as well as they have all season.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks gave up just three 3-pointers to a Pacer team that
usually feeds its transition game with open shots from the
perimeter. For the game, the Pacers had just 8 points on the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we did a good job getting back,'' Pacers forward
Dale Davis said. ``We gave up a lot of transition baskets, and we
can't afford to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy said Childs had had a great year. ``And I think it
comes from accepting who he is as a player, where he is in his
career and what he needs to do in order for our team to be
successful,'' Van Gundy said. ``He's been terrific.'' &QL;

SAN ANTONIO TAKE ITS TIME, AND GAME 2 
</HEADLINE>

   SAN ANTONIO _ Once it became close, the San Antonio Spurs knew
they had it won.
</P>
<P>
   Recovering from an 18-point deficit, the Spurs defeated the
Portland Trail Blazers by 86-85 Monday night before 35,260
delirious fans at the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Spurs a 2-0 lead in this four-of-seven-game
Western Conference championship series, which will resume Friday in
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs won a game they never led until the final moments.
That was when Sean Elliott made an unfathomable 3-point shot from
the right baseline with 9 seconds remaining. The 3-pointer was
Elliott's sixth in seven attempts and came with the 6-foot-11-inch
Rasheed Wallace flying at him.
</P>
<P>
   As in Game 1, Portland had a chance for the victory, but shots
by Jimmy Jackson and Walt Williams fell short, giving the Spurs
their sixth victory in seven games this season against the Blazers.
All of the Spurs' victories have been decided in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very confident down the stretch,'' said David Robinson,
San Antonio's longtime leader. ``We've proved it time and time
again that we can win close games, so for us that's a good thing if
they are close games and come down to execution.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott scored 22 points to follow Tim Duncan's game-high 23,
and Robinson added 14 points as all five Spurs starters scored in
double figures. Arvydas Sabonis led Portland with 17 points, Damon
Stoudamire added 15 and Wallace scored 13.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Grant put the Blazers ahead by 74-63 on a smooth
turnaround jumper over Duncan with nine minutes remaining, but the
Spurs countered with their second big run of the half, this one a
9-0 surge. In a half of spurts, Portland put together the next one
behind a 3-pointer and slick spin move in the post by Jackson.
Wallace wrapped two jumpers around a jumper by Avery Johnson to
make it 82-74 with less than three minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   When Stoudamire followed a basket by San Antonio's Mario Elie
with a jump shot that made the score 84-76 with two minutes left,
the Spurs seemed dead. But Johnson, shooting with confidence
despite a terrible start, nailed a baseline jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Then Elliott got his fifth 3-pointer and Robinson stole the ball
from Wallace, leading to two free throws by Elie. Suddenly the
Blazers' lead was down to 1 point with 33 seconds on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Stoudamire took an ill-advised jumper on Portland's next
possession, but after Walt Williams grabbed the rebound, he made
one of two free throws to make it 85-83 and set up the drama at the
end.
</P>
<P>
   Just when Portland seemed ready to crash, especially with
Wallace and Grant on the bench with four fouls, another turnaround
occurred, and the Blazers regained control. Sabonis and Stoudamire
began scoring again, the Spurs turned cold and Portland pulled away
to lead by 67-60 heading into the final period.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers' grabbed their 48-34 halftime lead by running their
offense through Sabonis. With the slow-moving veteran using every
facet of his versatile game _ shooting, rebounding and passing _
Portland dominated the Spurs with a well-balanced attack.
</P>
<P>
   Though he shot poorly, making just three of 10 attempts, Sabonis
led the way with 9 first-half points while also notching five
rebounds and four assists.
</P>
<P>
   Keyed by the play of Sabonis, their 7-foot-3-inch center, the
Blazers enjoyed a surprising advantage in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   Running a seemingly endless supply of large bodies at San
Antonio's Duncan and Robinson, the Blazers outrebounded the Spurs
by 24-17 in the first half and had nine offensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   If it wasn't Sabonis using his bulk to battle the Spurs' big
men, it was Wallace, Grant, Jermaine O'Neal or Kelvin Cato.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace and Grant were as productive as Sabonis before foul
trouble sent them to the bench in the second quarter. Wallace had 7
points, and Grant matched his Game 1 scoring output with 8 points
and four rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, who scored all of his first-half points in the opening
quarter, teamed with Sabonis to total 15 points in leading the
Blazers to a 31-20 advantage after one quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers' offense was incredibly efficient, as they shot 57
percent against one of the top defensive outfits in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs seemed to be in for a boost when Grant was whistled
for his third foul just two minutes into the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But with Cato on the floor, the Blazers didn't miss a beat as
they ran to a 39-22 lead midway through the quarter. If Grant's
absence wasn't enough inspiration for San Antonio, then it seemed
that Wallace's would be. But when Wallace committed his third foul
and joined Grant on the bench with 6:42 left in the half, the Spurs
still could not take advantage, getting no closer than 11 points
before the break.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan led all scorers with 11 points, but it was quiet
production, largely because he only had two rebounds to go with it.
Robinson's 8 points and three rebounds also seemed minimal. With
San Antonio's big men unable to rule, the Spurs' horrific outside
shooting became huge.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, whose touch has always been a question mark, missed
four wide-open jumpers and two driving layups.
</P>
<P>
   Jaren Jackson, the reserve turned sharpshooter in the semifinal
victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, was no better, missing all
five of his shots, and Elie was just one for three. Only Elliott
provided anything on the perimeter, hitting two 3-pointers in
scoring 8.

1946 KILLING OF 4 BLACKS IS MOURNED

<P>
   BOSTWICK, Ga. _ In 1945, returning from the Pacific after four
and half years in the Army, George Dorsey got off the bus in
Monroe, east of Atlanta, and walked down a dirt road to his home.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as other veterans of World War II were honored, Memorial
Day services were held here to remember George Dorsey, not just for
what he did overseas, but because of what happened to him when he
returned.
</P>
<P>
   On July 24, 1946, after living quietly and working at a farm in
nearby Walton County for 10 months, Dorsey, his wife and two
others, all black, were shot to death by a group of about 15
whites, in one of Georgia's most infamous, and still unsolved,
incidents of racial brutality.
</P>
<P>
   On July 24, 1946, Dorsey and his companions were dragged out of
a car and shot more than 60 times because, people said at the time,
one of them, a farm worker named Roger Malcolm, had stabbed the son
of his white boss. Many people said the boss' son had been having
an affair with Dorothy Dorsey, Malcolm's common-law wife and
Dorsey's sister.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, many whites were outraged by the stabbing.
Eleven days later, less than an hour after Roger Malcolm had been
released on bail from the county jail, George Dorsey, 28, his wife,
Mae, 23, Roger Malcolm, 24, and Dorothy Dorsey, 20, lay lifeless on
the Georgia clay.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, dozens of people commemorated the deaths. In a plain
country church in neighboring Morgan County, about 60 people
listened to an account of the slayings and how George Dorsey, who
risked his life for his country, lost his life when he came home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every generation has the duty and responsibility to take up
the cross and advance the cause of human rights, human dignity and
good human relations,'' Christopher Culbreath, a local city
councilman, said from the pulpit Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``On July 24, 1946, George W. Dorsey answered the call for his
generation,'' Culbreath declared.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting six rows back, Jessie Robinson said she could not help
noticing how different the service was from the one given when
George Dorsey was buried. Mrs. Robinson, 86, was there that day,
when no one dared to mention the cause of George Dorsey's death. It
was too dangerous a subject, she said, so they said a prayer, put
him in the ground and walked away silently.
</P>
<P>
   After the speeches were given Monday, the crowd followed a
bagpipe player to the Mount Perry Missionary Baptist Church
cemetery, where the Dorsey and his wife are buried. An American
flag was folded by two sergeants from McPherson Army Base in
Georgia and handed to George Dorsey's nephew, Columbus Dorsey Jr.
Surrounded by graves marked by small, wooden crosses, Columbus
Dorsey shut his eyes as taps was played. His mother and brother,
sitting beside him, stared straight ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1946, the killings made national headlines and led to a
six-month FBI investigation. In the end, a federal grand jury of 21
whites and two blacks listened to 100 witnesses and came up with no
indictments.
</P>
<P>
   The case then lay dormant for almost half a century. The site of
the killings, a single-lane bridge over Moore's Ford, a section of
the muddy Apalachee River, was eventually torn down, and life went
on for the residents of this small northeast Georgia county, which
is still mostly farmland and forest.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1991, the case was reopened when a witness, Clinton
Adams, came forward. Adams was 10 when he and a friend saw the four
people being shot again and again in a barrage of bullets that, in
Adams' words, left smoke and bubbles coming out of their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, then a barefoot white boy in overalls, watched in horror
from the edge of a nearby grove of pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   He knew George Dorsey as the neighbor who came over to help chop
wood and who had run two miles to telephone an ambulance when
Adams' father died.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was over there in the war, he was a soldier
fighting,'' said Adams, 63, speaking from his home in Bonifay, Fla.
``But when he came back, he was just a nigger. Him being a veteran
didn't enter anybody's mind. I know I'm not supposed to talk like
that, but that's how it was then.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though he wanted to help, Adams said he thought that
talking would have cost him and his family their lives. Forty-five
years later, after a lifetime of moving from one town to the other
in fear of the Ku Klux Klan, which he believed was behind the
killings, he told the FBI his story. The case was reopened, but no
arrests have been made.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After the killings came back to public attention, a memorial
committee _ made up of blacks and whites and including civil rights
advocates and the athletic director at the University of Georgia _
was formed.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception in 1998 the group, the Moore's Ford Memorial
Committee, has laid granite headstones at the victims' previously
unmarked graves and led a march over the new bridge at the site of
the killings. Monday's service singled out George Dorsey as a
veteran of war.
</P>
<P>
   Holding his uncle's flag tightly, Columbus Dorsey Jr. said he
doubted any arrests would ever be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be a book wrote about it, but justice? No, justice
will never be done,'' he said.

 &HT;    Smoltz's return means move for Chen
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Rookie pitcher Bruce Chen is expected to return to AAA
Richmond today when John Smoltz is activated from the disabled list
for tonight's start. Chen made two starts in which he kept the
Braves in contention but didn't make enough of an impression for
the Braves to reconsider their decision to use Odalis Perez as the
fifth starter.
</P>
<P>
   Perez is coming off his best start of the year on Friday night
in which he flirted with a shut out against the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Chen allowed six earned runs in 12 innings, four on the grand
slam by Gary Gaetti in his first inning in his first start. He ran
into trouble in the first inning of his second start, this time
with his location but escaped without allowing a run. He received a
no decision after holding the Brewers to two runs in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know I can pitch here,'' Chen said. ``There's nothing I
can do about (the decision) but go back to Richmond. I have to keep
working, getting more starts. Other than that, I think I'm fine. I
don't think I have to develop, I just need the opportunity.
Hopefully I opened some eyes, that people will say the kid is
ready. If (another injury) happens, I'll be the first one they call
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz ready
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz reports that the 15 days off has served him well and he's
ready for today's start against the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have waited three more weeks and I don't think it
would have done me any good,'' Smoltz said. ``You never know how
your elbow is going to react. I know I can pitch when it ain't
great, that's the comforting thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss waits
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Walt Weiss had toyed with the idea of getting back in
the lineup on Monday but manager Bobby Cox thought he needed a day
or so to make absolute sure his sore left quadriceps was ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel it some,'' said Weiss, who strained it running
out an infield hit in Milwaukee. ``(Cox) wants me to go out there
100 percent, so there's no chance of going backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said he ran at 50 percent on Sunday and planned to push
himself to about 85 percent in his workout Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The times he gets frustrated about sitting, all Weiss has to do
is think about last year when quadriceps and hamstring injuries
limited him to 96 games, his fewest since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the one who wasn't smart at times,'' Weiss said. ``Every
day I keep wanting to get back in there, but last year is a good
reminder.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive lapse
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have played some uncharacteristically flawed defense
this season, never more evident than over the weekend when a pair
of errors led to two losses to the Dodgers. Through 50 games last
year the Braves had committed only 21 errors. This season through
50 games, they've had 41.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's one of those things,'' said first baseman Brian
Hunter, who was responsible for one of them against the Dodgers.
``You don't hit for a while, you don't pitch well for a while,
we're in a slump making errors. The last couple have hurt us.
Hopefully guys will crack down. I'll take groundballs, just like I
always do. To me, it was just a decision I made (to go for a double
play), not a physical (mistake).''
</P>
<P>
   Angel Pena's line drive took a hop Hunter wasn't expecting and
bounced through his legs. It wound up costing the Braves two runs
in a 2-1 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could have knocked it down we would have been out of the
inning easy,'' Hunter said. ``In that situation, I should have
knocked the ball down.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko's error on Sunday, trying to catch a high throw from
Chipper Jones, cost the Braves a 5-4 extra inning loss.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko (6) and Hunter (2) have combined for eight errors at
first base, compared to Andres Galarraga's five through 50 games
last year. Weiss has nine errors in 42 games. He had 12 in 96 games
last year. Chipper Jones has five errors in 48 games, he had 12 in
158 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves finished first in the National League with a .985
fielding percentage last year. Right now they rank sixth in the
National League with a .978 fielding percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rely an awful lot on playing flawless defense, and when we
don't play good defense behind (Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine) we're
going to get beat,'' Jones said. ``It's going to happen to some of
the best players in the game...Are we worried? No.

 &HT;    Braves best Rockies 3-1
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Remember that 20-5 doozy the Braves won at Coors Field
last month? Remember who started for Colorado?
</P>
<P>
   Rockies right-hander Pedro Astacio is one man who's like to
forget, and planned to use Monday night to do it.
</P>
<P>
   In a place he'd been uncharacteristically effective against the
Braves _ he's 2-0 at Turner Field against the team that's beaten
him more times than any other in baseball (11) _ Astacio pitched
stingier, the way he has for his last four starts.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves beat him anyway, using three hits and two runs
batted in by Brian Jordan, a key RBI hit by Ryan Klesko in the
sixth and a strong pitching effort of his own by Kevin Millwood to
pick up the 3-1 win and even their record to 2-2 on this homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, who was pitching on three days rest for the second
time in his career in preparation for John Smoltz's coming off the
disabled list today, did some gutsy pitching to pull out his fourth
consecutive win.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood mixed stretches of dominance with shakiness, but for
the most part pitched like the most formidable Braves starter in
the absence of Smoltz that escaped him in his last outing against
the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   He clutched a 2-1 lead after allowing a solo home run to Vinny
Castilla in the fourth inning, loading the bases in the fifth and
using a Castilla popup to get out of it. He retired the next six
batters he saw and got a little more breathing room with a Braves
run in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Take Rockies pitching out of the Rockies and it hasn't looked so
bad. Colorado pitchers had a 2.57 ERA in the first seven games on
this trip through Houston and Philadelphia, riding a streak of a
club record 17 scoreless innings coming into Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves squelched that by taking a 1-0 lead four batters into
the game, 2-0 two innings later, but left a pair of runners on each
time on consecutive outs by Javy Lopez and Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves weren't raking Astacio this time, just picking at him
with infield hits and grounders sneaking up the middle. The 2-0
lead came on five singles, both after Bret Boone reached, moved to
third on Chipper Jones singles and scored on Jordan hits.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio pitched three more innings this time (6) against the
Braves than the start in Denver, allowed one fewer hit (7) and
three fewer runs (3). Still the same nemesis though. Jordan had two
RBIs and a run scored in the April game on a two-run home run, two
RBIs and a run scored this time on a pair of singles.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Remlinger came in in relief of Millwood, and John Rocker
was brought in for the 9th inning. Rocker got his 10th save of the
season.

ON BASEBALL: RAMIREZ RAISES BROWS BEHIND HIS (HOT?) BAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Poor Manny. His friends have abandoned him. The large
groups who used to sit in the upper stands on the third base side
of Yankee Stadium do not go there anymore. At least that is what he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be the same because some of my friends don't
go to the ball park anymore,'' Manuel Aristides Ramirez said
Saturday of the Cleveland Indians' impending visit to New York.
``They're working.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday was a holiday, so who among Ramirez's Washington
Heights friends was working?
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, after he reignited the Indians' volatile offense
with a two-run home run in the first inning and set the tone for a
7-1 Indians victory, Ramirez still insisted his friends had not
been among the 46,000 fans at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't like me anymore,'' he said Monday, then laughed.
</P>
<P>
   At that very moment, two young men sat at Ramirez's locker in
the visiting clubhouse. They wouldn't say much _ ``He doesn't like
me to talk about him,'' one of them said _ but they acknowledged
they were his friends and one said, ``A lot of Dominicans were here
today.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ramirez, a Dominican Republic native who grew up and lives in
New York, chose to remain mysterious about his New York fans, he
also raised suspicion about the bat he used to hit the home run.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Yankees suspected that the bat had more than wood
in it _ cork, to be descriptive _ citing Ramirez's unusual reaction
to the home run and his decision to use a different bat in the
second inning, when he rapped a two-out run-scoring single off an
umpire's foot ahead of Jim Thome's grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   If they are correct about the cork, would that illegal aid taint
the two-month performance that has made Ramirez the chief rival of
Derek Jeter for the American League Most Valuable Player Award? Not
if Ramirez abandons the bat and no one ever establishes that he
produced most or at least some of his major-league-leading 63 runs
batted in with that sticky wicket.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez does not talk much about his hitting or anything else
for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't speak English well, not enough to do an
interview,'' said Omar Vizquel, the Indians' shortstop and an
articulate and delightful Venezuelan. ``That's what he says. That's
his excuse. But he can say so many nice things.''
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the Cleveland club attributed Ramirez's
reticence to shyness. But in what apparently was his first and only
interview of the season, Ramirez last Saturday talked briefly about
his 1999 hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year,'' he said softly, ``I think I'm more lucky. I'm
getting hits at right time. More runners are on base. Sometimes I
bring them in; sometimes I don't. I just try to be patient. It's
still early. A lot of things can happen. I'm not trying to get a
big head. I just go out and play and whatever happens happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Ramirez has been a corking good hitter
throughout his six-year major-league career. In his previous four
seasons, he batted .310 and averaged 34 home runs and 113 RBIs a
year. Last year he established career highs with 45 home runs and
145 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   His home run and umpire-aided single Monday raised this season's
average to .350, fourth in the league, and kept him well ahead of
other hitters in the RBI race. By comparison, he has more RBIs than
any pair of Yankees except Jeter and Chili Davis, who combined have
knocked in 66 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manny may have the most pure sweet swing,'' Mike Hargrove, the
Indians' manager, said. ``You watch him take batting practice, and
it doesn't look like he's swinging hard, and the ball jumps off his
bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove, it should be noted, offered that observation before
the Yankees' suspicions surfaced and later wasn't around to address
that issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got tremendous power to all fields, which is a huge
advantage'' _ his home run cleared the center field fence _ ``and
he's a very good off-field hitter,'' the manager continued. ``He
can pull the ball, but if you stay out away from him too long he'll
hurt you in that direction, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove said that Ramirez had developed one flaw this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times he's overswinging,'' he said. ``I've very rarely seen
Manny do that before. Usually he swings very controlled and
measured. It's a good swing; it's a good, powerful, quick swing
when he does that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why he does it. I think Manny wants to hit the
ball out of the ball park when he does that. I also think Manny
knows himself better as a hitter now, knows the pitchers better and
gets into a good count when he knows he can hit this ball hard and
he gets the pitch that he wants and he overswings. All hitters do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, remarkably, has become more than a one-dimensional
player. The Indians generally agree that he has improved
tremendously in right field and adequately on the bases.
</P>
<P>
   As a base runner, with some help from Roberto Alomar, he has
become more focused and more aggressive. Running with greater
confidence, Ramirez has become a two-base runner instead of one who
stops at each base along the way, Hargrove said.
</P>
<P>
   The manager also said Ramirez had made himself one of the better
right fielders in the league, covering a lot of territory and
possessing an above-average arm, above-average accuracy and a quick
release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to work a little bit every day,'' Ramirez said. ``I take
fly balls and ground balls. I think that has helped me a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the question remains. Has cork helped him a lot, too?

 &HT;    Carnival ride inspection bill goes to governor
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A year after a 15-year-old girl was thrown to
her death from an amusement park ride at the Austin-Travis County
Livestock Show and Rodeo, Gov. George W. Bush is poised to sign
legislation that would allow police to inspect and immediately shut
down unsafe rides.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gonzalo Barrientos, D-Austin, and Rep. Terry Keel,
R-Austin, filed the legislation in response to the death last
spring of McNeil High School student Leslie Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Under current Texas law, ride operators must be able to prove
that they have insurance and that the ride is inspected at least
once a year. Insurance companies can choose their own inspectors,
as long as they meet certain standards of education and experience.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would supplement that system by allowing law
enforcement officials to inspect and immediately shut down unsafe
rides. Under current rules, law enforcement officers or Texas
Department of Insurance officials must get a court order to close a
ride.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would stiffen sanctions for failing to comply
with the insurance and inspection rules, making jail time a
possibility in addition to fines.
</P>
<P>
   Keel called the new law ``probably the best in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a careful balance in the bill to promote
safety without overregulating private industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say the bill is weak because, unlike many other
states, Texas would not use state inspectors to ensure ride safety.
Others have questioned whether police officers will have the
expertise to recognize safety risks.
</P>
<P>
   But Keel insists that the new system is preferable to relying on
state inspectors, who wouldn't be able to inspect rides every day.
He noted that riders and police officers are always present, and
that most safety problems _ such as a broken lap bar or an
intoxicated operator _ are obvious to everyone. Senators added a
provision to the bill requiring signs notifying riders of their
right to contact a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of federal regulations, amusement park rules vary
greatly from state to state. Arkansas and Florida use state
inspectors to check rides at every setup, while Hawaii uses state
inspectors every six months. Nevada leaves it up to city code
inspectors. Missouri and North Dakota have no safety requirements.
Some states perform inspections but do not require insurance.

WOULD-BE SPOILERS CHOMPING AT BIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first of the great spoilers in American racing history was
the perfectly named Upset, the 2-year-old whose victory in the 1919
Sanford Memorial Stakes at Saratoga accounted for Man o' War's only
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Upset _ that surprising horse of nearly 80 years ago _ is said
to have inspired the common term for an unexpected result. But did
he really?
</P>
<P>
   The derivation isn't mentioned in any etymological guide I've
run across. Besides, what if the roles had been reversed in that
long-ago race? Would we be saying things like, ``The Jets' Super
Bowl victory _ now there was a real Man o' War''?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his effect on the language, Upset remains the best
example of the spoiler phenomenon, in which an otherwise
little-known horse hands a great horse a significant defeat and
thereby siphons some of the loser's fame for his own use.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen horses, including the streaking filly
Silverbulletday, will aim to defeat Charismatic in Saturday's
Belmont Stakes, spoiling the Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner's
bid for the first Triple Crown sweep since Affirmed did it in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Because the racing industry yearns for a Triple Crown winner
only a little less than world peace, the people who speak for the
would-be spoilers are bound to hear the same soul-searching
question over and over, in a variety of forms, the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't win, do you want Charismatic to win? Would it be
bittersweet to prevent a Triple Crown? . . .
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Elliott Walden, whose Victory Gallop denied Real Quiet
the Triple Crown a year ago and whose Menifee is the most likely
spoiler Saturday, knows the drill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll pull out the same questions and responses as last
year,'' Walden was quoted as saying. ``Would I feel sorry for Bob
Baffert? Would a piece of me like to see a Triple Crown winner? . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   They're silly questions, and I promise not to ask them more than
twice a morning this week.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed emotions about spoiling a Triple Crown? You've got to be
kidding.
</P>
<P>
   There's no faster, surer route to a place in the thoroughbred
racing history books than a well-timed upset.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one man's list of the 10 greatest spoilers of the
century. They include two Belmont Stakes winners, a Kentucky Derby
winner, a Preakness winner, two horses who played each other's
spoilers, and one human being.
</P>
<P>
   __ Upset: Man o' War won all six of his races before the Sanford
and all 14 after it. But on Aug. 13, 1920, carrying 130 pounds to
Upset's 115, he and jockey John Loftus started slowly, rushed into
a pocket and lost the sprint by half a length.
</P>
<P>
   Upset would finish second to Man o' War three times _ but his
career was made.
</P>
<P>
   __ Dark Star: Native Dancer, like Man o' War, lost only once, in
the 12th of his 22 races. Native Dancer's defeat was more widely
noted at the time it happened, because it happened in the 1953
Kentucky Derby, and because the distinctive gray colt was the first
equine TV star.
</P>
<P>
   Dark Star and jockey Henry Moreno, 24-1 in the Derby, led from
gate to wire and won by a head as Native Dancer got into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   __ Allen Jerkens: The only human on the list is the trainer
whose horses scored notable upsets of Kelso (three times),
Secretariat (twice), Cicada and Buckpasser. Jerkens, 70, will get
his first victory in a Triple Crown race at a fitting time if Best
of Luck beats Charismatic on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Foolish Pleasure: Winning the 1975 Kentucky Derby should be
his claim to fame. But he'll be remembered as the colt who won the
match race in which the undefeated filly Ruffian suffered her fatal
breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   __ J.O. Tobin: Seattle Slew came to Hollywood Park for the 1977
Swaps Stakes three weeks after completing his Triple Crown to stay
undefeated in nine career starts. Reserved seats were sold out a
week before the race. More than 68,000 fans showed up.
</P>
<P>
   But J.O. Tobin and Bill Shoemaker ended Slew's streak, leading
from start to finish to win by eight lengths in a Swaps-record 1:58
3/5. Seattle Slew, worn out after the classics, finished fourth
behind Affiliate and Text.
</P>
<P>
   __ Codex: Thanks to the unchivalrous tactics of jockey Angel
Cordero on the turn for home in the 1980 Preakness, Codex almost
literally knocked off Genuine Risk, the first filly in 65 years to
win the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Genuine Risk got the better of Codex in the Belmont as she
finished second to his seventh; 53-1 Temperence Hill won it.
</P>
<P>
   __ Easy Goer: His 1989 Belmont romp kept Sunday Silence from the
Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sunday Silence: Easy Goer fans see it the other way: Sunday
Silence kept Easy Goer from immortality with his sneaky victories
in the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Breeders' Cup Classic.
</P>
<P>
   __ Victory Gallop: For drama, it'll be hard for any of this
year's Belmont horses to top his last-jump win over Real Quiet last
June.
</P>
<P>
   __ Dare and Go: More than 44,000 fans, a Del Mar record, hoped
to see Cigar win the 1996 Pacific Classic and beat Citation's
American record with his 17th consecutive victory. Dare and Go and
jockey Alex Solis left him a solidly beaten second.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before the race, Dare and Go trainer Richard Mandella
joked that if he won, ``I'd feel terrible _ for about a second.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning at Hollywood Park, Mandella thought back and
revised that statement. ``Maybe a fifth of a second,'' he
said.!hair! &QL;

TEXAS LAWMAKERS END `GOOD LEGISLATIVE SESSION' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
and JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ &UR;  &LR; The Texas Legislature gaveled to a close Monday
for the last time this century, ending a session that focused on
letting the good times roll with tax cuts, big teacher pay raises,
children's health insurance and other laws designed to make Texans
feel like they are sharing in the state's economic bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been a really good legislative session,'' said
Gov. George W. Bush, who as a GOP front-runner stood to gain from
legislative success. ``Texas is a better place because of the last
140 days.''
</P>
<P>
   The 76th Legislature passed more than 1,340 bills this session _
from the grand (electric and telephone service deregulation) to the
minutiae (setting weight standards for loaves of bread). But those
that got the most protracted attention seemed to focus on sharing
Texas' economic vitality.
</P>
<P>
   A package of tax relief bills promise consumers and businesses
half a billion in tax reductions over the next biennium, and a
school funding bill will give the biggest boost in history to
public school funding. The school finance package will trigger an
estimated $1.35 billion in property tax reductions and offer every
teacher a one-time pay raise of $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we did ... we took the surplus, and we invested
it in the future of Texas,'' said House Speaker Pete Laney, a
Democrat from the Panhandle. He was referring to the lawmakers'
decision to devote $3.8 billion of the state's record $6 billion
surplus to public schools and universities.
</P>
<P>
   In their final day, before calling a close to business at 6:19
p.m., Texas senators spent more than four hours engaging in Academy
Award-length speeches, for fellow Sen. Gregory Luna, D-San Antonio,
who missed most of the session hospitalized; for Senate Secretary
Betty King for her 22-year tenure; and for Houston Democrat Rodney
Ellis, who was elected president pro tempore of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The title will make Ellis acting governor whenever Bush and Lt.
Gov. Rick Perry are out of state. It also means that if Bush is
elected president and Perry ascends to the governor's office, Ellis
would preside over the Texas Senate until the body elects a new
lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Given Bush's travel plans as he heads to Iowa and New Hampshire,
sites of the first two presidential primaries, Ellis may assume
those duties before long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush needs to do what he needs to do in New Hampshire,''
Ellis said, adding that Perry should take his family on a long
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, who has guided 278 bills into law during his five terms
in office _ 90 of them this session _ said he would head back to
Houston to spend some time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I've got to go back and face Pampers,'' he said, a
reference to his infant son.
</P>
<P>
   But senators also praised Perry for his freshman session at the
podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You came in as a rookie and you followed an icon (former Lt.
Gov. Bob Bullock),'' said Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   This session also marked the first time in the 20th century that
Republicans held a majority of seats in the 31-member Senate and
had a Republican at the helm as lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, said he believed partisanship was kept under
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a very successful legislative session because we had a
Republican lieutenant governor and a Democrat speaker work
together,'' he said. ``We had a successful legislative session
because we had a Democrat committee chairman carry a significant
piece of education reform, teacher pay and tax cuts. We had people
from both parties come together to do what was right for Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only a few weeks ago, however, that members of the Senate
were locked in a rancorous partisan fight over a hate-crimes bill
that could not be salvaged. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Act, sponsored by Ellis and Rep.
Senfronia Thompson, another Houston Democrat, identified specific
groups, including homosexuals, for protection from crimes of
prejudice. A law now on the books is so vague it is virtually
unenforceable, according to experts. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; For the first time ever, the tougher hate-crimes bill passed
the Texas House, winning the vote of one of the most conservative
members of that body _ Rep. Warren Chisum, R-Pampa. But it failed
in the Senate in a struggle so emotional and bitter it temporarily
shut down that chamber for most of one day. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Rep. Paul Sadler, D-Henderson, called the bill's failure a
defining issue of the session.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had victims on one side of that issue and hatred and
bigotry on the other. If you chose the latter, it says a lot about
the party you represent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More partisanship flared just 48 hours before the session ended
when the Republican-led Senate fought with the Democrat-controlled
House over how to spend the last $47 million in the school finance
package. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Senate wanted the money to go to tax cuts; the House, whose
negotiations were led by Sadler, wanted it to go to early childhood
education programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans did almost all the compromising, but Democrats
refused to give an inch. In the end, a hasty projection of $100
million more in revenue by the state comptroller saved the day.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the extra education funding and tax cuts, other
spread-the-wealth bills sent to the governor include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A government-funded health insurance program for 500,000
low-income children under the age of 19.
</P>
<P>
   _ A $100 million college scholarship to send about 20,000 high
school graduates whose families earn less than $25,000 to college.
</P>
<P>
   _ Creation of permanent endowments to fund health care programs,
including county and hospital district indigent care, and
anti-smoking campaigns _ initiatives made possible by the first
payments to the state from tobacco companies in a $17.3 billion
lawsuit settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the Legislature also passed the most significant
change in abortion laws since the procedure was legalized more than
two decades ago by passing a law that will require doctors to
notify parents when their minor daughters seek an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   A major blow to Bush and Republican leaders was a pilot project
to allow public schoolchildren to attend private schools at
taxpayer expense. Despite intense pressure from proponents and
support by the governor, the issue never made it to the floor of
either house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked hard on the voucher issue. It just wasn't meant to be
this legislative session,'' Bush said Monday. ``I believe it's
(vouchers) an idea that frightens certain people.''
</P>
<P>
   The House finished its business Monday with a whimper, approving
a few corrections to major bills and scores of minor resolutions.
Members bid one another good-bye, signed each others' souvenirs and
praised the session's legislative output.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was maybe more partisanship present,'' acknowledged
Laney, the House speaker and a legislator since the 1970s, ``but it
probably didn't play as big a role.''

<P>
   As the Northeast begins its smog season _ when sunshine, warmth
and pollution combine to sting eyes and strain lungs _ state
environmental officials from Maryland to Maine are reeling from a
series of court rulings that have derailed federal plans to cut the
flow of air pollution across state borders.
</P>
<P>
   New York and other states in the region find themselves down to
their last defense tactic against smog-causing chemicals drifting
downwind from coal-fired power plants in the Middle West and the
South, but even that tactic is likely to face court challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the federal Environmental Protection Agency formally
accepted petitions from New York, Pennsylvania and the six New
England states requesting a federally imposed cleanup of dirty
power plants in states that send nitrogen oxides and ozone _ the
components of smog _ east on the wind. Petitions from New Jersey
and Maryland are still under review.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Clean Air Act, after receiving such petitions, the EPA
can order sharp cuts in pollution at specific power plants or other
sources. The petitions are a ``legal hammer'' of last resort
against out-of-state polluters, said John Cahill, New York's
commissioner of environmental conservation. This is the first time
the EPA has accepted petitions of this sort, officials with the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   But the petitions are certain to be challenged in the courts by
the same coalition of state governments and industry groups that
gained the favorable court rulings against other aspects of the
EPA's plans for reducing smog. Environmental officials from Middle
Western states and power industry spokesmen say the EPA's strict
new standards for smog are not supported by science.
</P>
<P>
   A result of legal challenges is likely to be further delays in
ending smoggy summers in the Northeast, according to various state
officials and private environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big polluters are succeeding in delaying rules that would
prevent a lot of sickness and death in this region,'' said David
Wooley, a law professor at Pace University who has been providing
legal advice to a coalition of 18 private environmental
organizations contributing briefs in the court fights.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the 1999 smog season is off to an early start.
New York state environmental officials on Saturday issued the first
ozone advisory of the year, with levels in several parts of western
New York rising above the federal safety threshold of 80 parts per
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeastern states have long contended, and the
environmental agency concurs, that plumes of nitrogen oxides from
old coal-fired power plants in the Middle West and South contribute
to eye-burning haze and lung problems along the eastern seaboard.
In the presence of sunlight, the nitrogen compounds produce ozone.
Ozone, in turn, can irritate the lungs and eyes, contributing to
asthma and raising death rates in the elderly and infirm. The
nitrogen oxides also contribute to acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   To solve the problem, the EPA required 22 states last fall to
file plans by September for sharply reducing emissions of nitrogen
oxides.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, in 1997, the agency issued new limits for ozone that
were far lower than the previous standard. That drew immediate
legal challenges from power companies that relied on coal and
states with older, dirtier power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over long-distance air pollution has intensified in
the last few years as the electric power industry has begun opening
up to competition.
</P>
<P>
   States with many older, coal-fired power plants, like West
Virginia and Michigan, have much cheaper electricity than areas
with newer, cleaner power plants, like the Northeast, and they want
to keep that competitive advantage, industry executives and state
officials in both regions say.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, several state environmental officials said, after
several years of relatively constructive negotiations and
cooperative research among the states to reduce smog, talks have
stalled and the battleground has shifted to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The latest court rulings on federal smog controls came on May 14
and May 25 in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia. In the first, two of three judges on a panel ruled that
the EPA had not adequately justified the need for a strict new
standard for ozone. The same ruling overturned new standards for
soot particles. The EPA was invited to return to court to
substantiate the numbers it chose. That decision was hailed by
industry groups and denounced by private environmental
organizations and the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   In the second ruling, three judges, including the two that
rejected the EPA's ozone standard, said states could hold off on
filing the plans for pollution cuts until the merits of the federal
requirements for nitrogen oxides were argued.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the rulings are likely to delay federal programs to
sharply cut levels of nitrogen oxides and ozone in the eastern half
of the country, Carol Browner, the EPA administrator, said in a
telephone interview on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency planned to return to court this summer with a new
argument in support of its pollution standards, Ms. Browner said.
``We're going to continue to look at how to provide the relief to
downwind states.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell Harding, the director of Michigan's Department of
Environmental Quality, said Friday that the courts acted
appropriately because the EPA could identify no ``bright line'' for
health effects of ozone that separated safe levels from hazardous
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there's no clear human threshold, then picking a number
becomes a policy call,'' Harding said. He added that setting policy
is the responsibility of Congress, not the agency.

<P>
   While waiting for appeals to play out, he said, Michigan plans
to proceed with a nitrogen-cutting proposal and still intends to
reduce its output of the smog-causing chemicals, but to a less
stringent standard than that sought by the EPA. ``We know we have
some culpability in Michigan,'' Harding said, ``but it's way, way
less than what they're talking about.''

<P>
   ``My view is that EPA is in deep trouble, and they know it,'' he
said. ``It's a house of cards that Carol Browner has built on
politics and bad science, and it's falling.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior EPA officials said the agency's smog standards had
nothing to do with politics and were a result of hundreds of
scientific studies and comments from states and industry.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shinn, the New Jersey commissioner of environmental
protection, said there was plenty of evidence from studies in New
Jersey backing the need for the strict ozone standard set by the
EPA.
</P>
<P>
   He said New Jersey had commissioned a study of asthma attacks
treated at a Morristown hospital and found that admissions rose 30
percent on days when ozone levels topped 60 parts per billion _ not
even a level as high as the federal standard of 80 parts per
billion.
</P>
<P>
   He added that half of the ozone measured in the state has been
shown to be a result of pollution carried on wind from the west.
Shinn has an ozone meter in his state car, he said, and often keeps
it running to track smog levels as he crisscrosses the state.
``I've found high levels in real rural areas _ in places where it
just shouldn't be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If transport is 50 percent of our problem,'' Shinn said, ``no
matter what we do to cut emissions here, we can never guarantee
healthy air for our residents.''

CRAIG GOT PAST ERRORS TO LEAD TROJANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wouldn't have been a career-breaker for Beau Craig, USC's
freshman third baseman who is going to switch to catcher next year.
But Craig knew it would be a long summer if his mistakes cost the
Trojans a chance to defend their national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have felt like the (jerk) on the team,'' Craig said.
``I would have been the guy that blew it. I'm always pretty hard on
myself. I've never had the perfect game. Things stick out in my
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig's two throwing errors, which led to USC's 4-3 loss to
Pepperdine on Sunday, became footnotes. The Trojans, pushed to a
final game to advance to this weekend's ``super regional'' at
Stanford, came back to beat the Waves 12-7 in the second game and
win the first-round regional at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a good thing, that my teammates picked me up,'' said
Craig, who contributed as much as anybody in USC's clinching win.
He went 3 for 4 and was flawless on two chances.
</P>
<P>
   Even after his earlier miscues, Craig was fearless. He told
shortstop Seth Davidson he was going to go after every ball hit to
the left side of the infield. An All-State catcher in high school,
Craig fielded dozens of ground balls last week to prepare for the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of stuff coming my way,'' he said. ``We're
playing better teams and better hitters. I'm not going to get much
of a break over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig's ability to hit _ his batting average is fifth-highest on
the team _ has kept him in the lineup. When starting catcher Eric
Munson broke his hand early in the season and missed 21 games,
Craig moved back behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Mike Gillespie is appreciative of what Craig has done
this season and the way his freshman rebounded Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Craig) should be proud of the defense he played,''
Gillespie said.
</P>
<P>
   __ No surprise: As expected, the NCAA announced Monday that
Stanford will host USC in a three-game series to determine a spot
in the College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   USC (36-24) and Stanford both put in bids to host the super
regional, but the Cardinal (46-13) are the nation's No. 6 seed and
the NCAA indicated that seedings were important for determining
second-round sites.
</P>
<P>
   Munson, who hit two home runs Sunday and was selected the
outstanding player in this past weekend's regional, doesn't care
that the games are at Stanford, where USC won two of three games
from the Pac-10-champion Cardinal in April.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans and Cardinal have played 323 times but never in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely always a tough series,'' Munson said. ``We'll
have to play our best baseball to win.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Little big man: The regional All-Tournament team included
four Pepperdine players but not sophomore outfielder Austin Evans,
who batted .450 (nine for 20) with eight runs scored and four RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Being left out hasn't bothered Evans, a 5-foot-8, 155-pound
former walk-on who became the Waves' starting center fielder and
leadoff batter in the middle of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Evans' parents, Bob and Shary, flew to Los Angeles from their
home outside Austin, Texas, to see their son play. It was the first
time they had seen him in a college game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When coaches (in the past) saw him initially, they saw his
size, not his ability,'' said Bob. ``Austin knew what he could
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Shary: ``His (high school) coach would always put him down.
He never got any respect because he was small.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who graduates in December, a year and a half ahead of
schedule, is one of eight underclassmen who started Sunday's final
game for the Waves, who finished 46-16.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine gained at least one out-of-area admirer after pushing
USC to the brink this weekend _ Virginia Commonwealth head coach
Paul Keyes. The Waves beat the Rams 12-5 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell they've got a lot of character,'' Keyes said. ``I
enjoyed watching them play. . . . Just a well-schooled team.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The old college try: Harvard went two-and-out at USC, marking
the first time in three years the Crimson didn't win a playoff
game.
</P>
<P>
   Although none of the seven teams from the Northeast won a
regional this year, Harvard head coach Joe Walsh said teams from
the East get a bad rap at playoff time for receiving bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are some good Northeast teams that are home,''
Walsh said last week. ``The thing we (Harvard) can't overcome is
the lack of scholarships. Most of these guys have a couple jobs
during the season.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Around the horn: Cal State Fullerton, the national No. 3
seed, won its regional at Notre Dame but is on the road again this
weekend. The Titans play at Ohio State in a super regional. . . .
Long Beach State was swept in two games by host Texas A&AMP;M Sunday
and was eliminated in the first round. Senior outfielder Termmel
Sledge (Granada Hills) went 5 for 10 in the two games for the
49ers, who went to the CWS last year. . . . USC pitching coach John
Savage said he is not a candidate for the head job at Cal and he is
supporting Cal assistant David Lawn for the job. Long Beach State
head coach Dave Snow, whose son Casey played at Crespi, is rumored
to be interested in going to Berkeley.

COMMENTARY: PEARL HARBOR AND A DEBT STILL UNPAID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Hawaii, Fla., Utah, N.J.)  (lh) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As always, Memorial Day took Leonard Purifoy back to
Dec. 7, 1941, back to Pearl Harbor, back to the boundless realm of
terror and the cold iron touch of death.
</P>
<P>
   Purifoy was a sailor in Hawaii that fateful day when Japanese
fighter planes attacked the United States fleet there. It took his
battleship, the Utah, 10 minutes to capsize after being torpedoed.
</P>
<P>
   Some people can live a lifetime in 10 minutes. This young man
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared and I was running,'' said Purifoy, now 80, a
retired mechanic living in Jacksonville, Fla. ``I thought the ship
was about to blow. I got out just in time. I guess I wouldn't have
if I wasn't so scared. I imagine I'd have been on the bottom with
the chief.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief was Chief Watertender Peter Tomich, and Purifoy
believes he was the last person to see him alive.
</P>
<P>
   Tomich, 48, was in charge of the Utah's engine room. While
others scrambled to get off the ship, he raced below deck to keep
the boilers from exploding and to make sure crewmen got out safely.
Most did, but 64 were killed, including the chief. He is among 58
sailors entombed to this day in the Utah's rusty hulk.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor, the
nation's highest decoration, for ``extraordinary courage and
disregard of his own safety.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes this more than just another old war story is this:
</P>
<P>
   No one ever received Tomich's medal. It is, in fact, the only
Medal of Honor in the last century never to have been presented to
someone, whether the person being honored or relatives.
</P>
<P>
   It has bounced from one display case to another, first on a
World War II destroyer called the Tomich, then in the Utah state
capitol building. Later, it went to the Navy Museum in Washington,
where it lies in a storeroom.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, a Navy spokeswoman said, is that the authorities
have never found ``definitive proof'' that Tomich had any
relatives. Back in the 1940s, she said, a man he had listed as next
of kin, a cousin living in Los Angeles, could never be found.
</P>
<P>
   But the New York Naval Militia, which has taken the Tomich case
under its wing, insists that the real problem is the Navy itself:
It and bureaucratic sloth.
</P>
<P>
   If the Navy has uncovered no proof, the New York militia says,
it is because it has done nothing to find it. Worse, the New
Yorkers say, Navy officials keep shrugging off evidence that Tomich
indeed has kin: distant cousins in the Balkans who would be
delighted to receive his medal.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. J. Robert Lunney knows, because he has tracked them
down himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all so frustrated over why our government doesn't
recognize their family,'' said Lunney, a Westchester lawyer who is
staff judge advocate for the Naval Militia, which for those
unfamiliar with it is equivalent to the Army National Guard. It
became involved because Tomich had once lived in Queens and had
joined the Army at Fort Slocum, N.Y., before switching services and
enlisting in the Navy from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   This is a tale that gets a little messy. We are talking,
remember, about the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The cousins, Lunney said, are Croatians from a village called
Prolog, an outpost of the Austro-Hungarian empire when Tomich was
born in 1893. Now it lies in western Bosnia. All the same, family
members are Croatian. One is a Croatian army officer.
</P>
<P>
   They use the name of the larger clan to which they belong:
Tonic. After Petar Tonic journeyed to America (becoming a citizen
in 1918), his name took new shape. Any child or grandchild of
immigrants will recognize the process by which Petar became Peter
and Tonic became Tonich, morphing later into Tomich.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting Prolog in 1997, after talking with villagers and
studying well-kept local records, Lunney became convinced that,
Tonic or Tomich, all belong to the same family. ``They're all so
proud,'' he said. ``And all they want is some acknowledgment that
the medal should be presented to them. It would be fine if it then
comes back here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   You might be wondering why any of this matters after so many
years. You might as well ask Leonard Purifoy why Memorial Day
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the right thing to do for a man who gave his life
for this country,'' said Rear Adm. Robert A. Rosen, commander of
the New York Naval Militia. ``It's a matter of honor.''

RUSSIAN ARREARS DEEPENING ON DEBTS TO FOREIGN GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ On Wednesday, Russia will default on roughly $900
million in interest payments on debt it owes the so-called London
Club, a group of major foreign banks and investors that lent money
to commercial entities of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Reneging on debt may be a grave transgression, but most London
Club lenders have shown little rancor or surprise at Russia's
failure to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Although a splinter group of U.S. creditors is threatening suit
against Russia, the London Club as a whole seems hesitant to act.
It could restructure the debt with the Russians, or it could get
tough and call in the full amount, accelerating a default. Yet
because of a host of considerations, the creditors have instead
chosen to look the other way as a bankrupt Russia falls deeper into
arrears.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's likely to happen after June 2 is that Russia will
remain in default and not get called on it,'' Charles Blitzer, the
chief international economist with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette,
said.
</P>
<P>
   When its economy collapsed last August, Russia unilaterally
annulled obligations on a range of debt, including a default on $40
billion of treasury bills. Besides its own loans, Russia had also
inherited the former Soviet Union's debts to foreign governments
and private lenders. After the crisis, Russia said it would honor
foreign debt it had accumulated after the fall of the Soviet Union,
which includes Eurobonds, loans from the International Monetary
Fund and a few other instruments. But the Russian government
maintained that it lacked the resources to pay the Soviet debt.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the June 2 default surprises few people because Russia
is already in arrears on $300 million it owed the London Club in
December 1998. All told, Russia has fallen behind on about $1.2
billion of about $30 billion in Soviet-era debt it owes the London
Club.
</P>
<P>
   When Russia did not pay last year, that debt was automatically
rolled over under the terms of its London Club contract. But some
creditors also called for a vote to accelerate default, which means
the whole sum comes due immediately. That measure failed, but it is
likely that a newly formed association of investment funds, the
U.S.-based Russia London Club Portfolio Managers Inc., may again
demand such a vote once a 15-day grace period passes after the June
2 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the commercial banks in the London Club are mistaken
about the sentiment among creditors this time,'' said Marc Helie,
managing director of the New York investment management firm
Gramercy Advisors and chairman of the association, whose members
hold about 10 percent to 15 percent of the total London Club debt.
``I think now many other creditors will vote for an acceleration of
default.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the vote, the emergence of the investor
association alone shows how fractured the London Club is, which may
help explain its hesitancy over Russia. About half of those holding
London Club debt are investment funds, according to Helie. Yet the
bank steering committee that actually negotiates with the Russians
is drawn from major lenders like Deutsche Bank AG, J.P. Morgan &AMP;
Co. and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. Helie and others say that because these
banks want future business with Russia, they may be unwilling to
pressure the government on the London Club arrears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The London Club has objectives beyond Soviet debt, such as
bilateral debt, underwriting of new securities, all of which would
tend to dilute their focus on these debt securities,'' Helie said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The varied business goals of the creditors and their access to
the Russians themselves affect how they view Russia's ability to
pay. Some argue that Russia could pay, at least partly, but is
unwilling to, because it knows that for the time being it can get
away with delaying tactics. They note that in mid-May, Russia
scraped together about $330 million in interest on bonds issued
against another package of Soviet-era debt. But those bonds are
held mainly by Russian investors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet others on the steering committee who are in regular contact
with the Russians say Moscow wants to pay but cannot, which
necessitates patience. ``Russia has been paying its debts incurred
since 1992, but only by borrowing from the Central Bank,'' one
London Club banker said. Russia's hard currency reserves are about
$11 billion now. ``It shows you that they have no further funds to
pay old debts,'' the banker said.
</P>
<P>
   The London Club is forming a subcommittee to do the preliminary
economic research to begin talks with Russia on restructuring,
tentatively scheduled for late June. Russian officials have said
repeatedly that they would like 75 percent of their debt forgiven,
which is unlikely. In fact, some observers think the London Club
should stay in its holding pattern, without restructuring or
calling a default, until the Russian presidential elections in
mid-2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the right time to get into serious negotiations,
because there won't be a stable government until there's a new
president,'' Blitzer said. ``The London Club is best advised to
agree to nothing and wait.''

DODGERS NEED A BREAK JOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ The Los Angeles Dodgers have won four of six games
and can finish the road trip in fine shape if they close out
Pittsburgh with two wins. But you get the idea that just as the
Dodgers reach the doorstep of putting together a momentum-building
streak, something, or some things, happen to push them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make your own breaks,'' manager Davey Johnson said after the
Dodgers lost 5-4 Monday to Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   It's simple, a cliche, and perfectly suitable as the reason the
Dodgers failed in their attempt to win three straight games for the
first time in a month. They had two guys thrown out when relay
throws were cut off and thrown to other bases. They produced one
run in five at-bats with runners in scoring position and played
conservatively on two balls hit to the outfield in an eighth inning
in which the Pirates scored the tying and eventual winning runs.
</P>
<P>
   It looks familiar to Pirates second baseman Warren Morris.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dodgers have failed to put together a head-twitching
winning streak in a month, the Pirates won four straight and seven
of nine, and entered the Dodgers series having swept the Houston
Astros in three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to believe whenever you get on a roll things are
going to go your way and good things are going to start happening
for you,'' said Morris, whose bloop single in the eighth inning
scored the Pirates' fifth run. ``The positive energy carries over,
a lot like Kevin (Young) today, taking advantage on the hustle play
and scoring from first (on a ball hit in front of left fielder Gary
Sheffield).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about momentum. If you can keep the negative things
to a minimum, you can carry it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Using (some of) the 'pen: Dodgers lefty Pedro Borbon is
coming off elbow surgery and hadn't pitched in the big leagues for
two full seasons, Alan Mills is the only right-handed set-up man
the Dodgers have and closer Jeff Shaw has appeared in 10 nonsave
situations. They've combined for 68 appearances while the other 11
pitches the Dodgers have used in relief have combined for 62
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson is taking it slow in developing
rookies Onan Masaoka and Jamie Arnold, and the results of that is
shown in the use of Borbon, Mills and Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Borbon) is not a long reliever, but I also have to bring
Masaoka along,'' Johnson said. When we're more ahead, I can use
Masaoka. I've given more work to Borbon. He's handled it. As
Masaoka comes along and Arnold gets better, they'll get (more
innings). If it were late in the year, after I'd have used Borbon
for an inning, I'd use Masaoka for a few innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Borbon, Mills and Shaw have a 2.33 ERA in 692/3
innings. The other 11 Dodgers used in relief _ including one
appearance each from Carlos Perez and Darren Dreifort _ have a 6.81
ERA in 762/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   With Mills and Borbon both used regularly in the first six games
of the road trip, Johnson went to Masaoka, Doug Bochtler and Jamie
Arnold against the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   __ A draining inning: One reason Dodgers starter Chan Ho Park
didn't pitch into the seventh was a long fourth inning in which he
faced five batters but had a lengthy duel with first baseman Kevin
Young. The at-bat lasted 12 pitches and finished with Young drawing
a walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That situation I had to concentrate and focus on a strike and
not corner, corner,'' Park said. ``Every time I throw too many
pitches in one inning, it's not good for the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   __ This and that: Dodger catcher Todd Hundley's two-run homer in
the fourth inning was his first hit in 18 at-bats during the road
trip. . . . Five of the past seven games have been decided by one
run. The Dodgers are 3-2 in that stretch. . . . Raul Mondesi
extended his hitting streak to seven games.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Brady, the Parade Magazine columnist, was driving toward
his white-clapboard home on Further Lane in the fashionable Long
Island, N.Y., community of East Hampton, telling funny stories
about his rich and famous neighbors, when his eyes fell upon the
hulk of an abandoned, unfinished home that had all the grace of a
prison wing, only with larger windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the grandchildren trained,'' Brady, 70, said sadly.
``We tell them, `Don't look at the yucky house,' but my
granddaughter Sarah _ she's 5 _ she'll always peek, and say, `I saw
it, I saw the yucky house.'''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Ladies Village Improvement Society, which has taken
a hard line against all things neon, and despite town planners who
once tried to stop an East Hampton merchant from displaying
Halloween pumpkins, the yucky house still stands _ both as a symbol
of change in the Hamptons, and as a reminder of the annual ritual
of criticism that befalls this celebrity haven in eastern Long
Island each Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Brady, who has kept a house here for 20 years, said the
questions are always the same: Have the Hamptons become declasse?
Have they been ruined by IPO arrivistes who chug $40 shots of
Porfidio tequila with their Southwestern Sushi? Have they been
spoiled by hordes of ``day trippers'' _ words always spoken with a
sneer here _ who come hoping per chance to rub elbows with Steven
Spielberg at the Blue Parrot, or Martha Stewart at Nick &AMP; Toni's?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear that every year, and then the next year it's more
popular than ever,'' said Brady, who, despite the eyesore mansion
100 yards down the road, declared: ``Further Lane is about as good
as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Propelled by a bull market and fueled by celebrity sightings,
change is rippling as never before across the Hamptons, and it is
challenging traditional defenses that have long served to protect
the Hamptons Way of Life, many locals say.
</P>
<P>
   The Ladies Society, the taste patrol for East Hampton, continues
to issue warnings about hedge heights, but newly minted Internet
magnates persist in challenging conventions with lavish
landscaping. More beaches are requiring parking permits to keep
people away, but more parking permits are being sold than ever.
Rental prices, already steep, keep climbing, but young Wall Street
traders barely bat an eye at $45,000 for the summer season.
</P>
<P>
   Town planning boards come up with new barriers, yet vineyards
and farm fields keep getting plowed under for developments that
look suspiciously like upscale suburbs. Even horse owners are
feeling pinched. ``I used to ride everywhere, and now there's
always a trail _ and a house on it,'' said Nancy Hodin, an
independent television producer.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes the dreaded inevitable: chain stores. In Hampton
Bays, which marks the western entry to the Hamptons, McDonald's has
applied for planning approval. There are dark rumors that Starbucks
has plans for Bridgehampton, and Blockbuster made it into Water
Mill, though this is considered a safe distance from East Hampton,
where the standards are thought to be the toughest. Yet even there,
right in the heart of Main Street, Banana Republic stands proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the affronts, on Sunday an airplane towed a banner
advertisement for a chain of steakhouses past the Maidstone Country
Club, a blue-blood bastion of exclusivity in East Hampton. It may
as well have been Coney Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of money floating around here, and these stores
want to be in it,'' said a resigned Roland Eisenberg, co-owner of
the Blue Parrot.
</P>
<P>
   The money floats in on private helicopters and corporate jets
and gleaming white yachts. ``I just got it yesterday,'' said
Jonathan Iseson, a 42-year-old hedge fund manager, docking his
48-foot cruiser at the Sag Harbor Yacht Club. He downsized from a
55-footer. ``I got rid of the wife, so I didn't need the space,''
he explained.
</P>
<P>
   With the money has come increased competition for cocktail
invitations, for dinner reservations, for parking spaces, for tee
times. Andrew Weddle, 35, a real estate executive from South
Carolina, said the $7,000 he paid for a share of a beach home in
East Hampton is small change for him and his banking friends, who
constantly compare who has the coolest Porsche, the hottest
girlfriend. He said all this while standing next to his girlfriend,
Denise Shannon, 31, a woman with honey-blond hair and cherry-red
toenails. Ms. Shannon introduces herself as a hair designer, and
then speaks of enduring condescending party questions about her
career choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby, don't be discouraged,'' Weddle told her soothingly.
</P>
<P>
   It is all too much for some year-round residents who want to be
left alone, though they don't exactly mind the soaring property
values. ``Yuppie scum!'' roars Phil Berg, 50, a local contractor.
``They think nothing about pulling out in front of a guy with a
loaded dump truck.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Hamptons are under siege from interloping yuppies, it
is also true that they are under assault from established residents
who bicker constantly over how much is too much. Exhibit A, of
course, is Ira Rennert's planned construction in Sagaponack of a
60,000-square-foot castle with 25 bedrooms and 39 bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm opposed to it because it's too goddamned big, but that's
not a very reasoned argument,'' said Brady, whose latest book,
``The House That Ate The Hamptons'' (St. Martin's Press), is based
on the Rennert compound.
</P>
<P>
   But there are lesser known examples, such as the estate on
Wiborg Beach in East Hampton, known as the ``TWA House'' for its
hangar-like appearance. Esthetics aside, many here consider the
house in bad taste because a wall juts from the house and blocks
the view of neighbors Herbert Ross, the film director, and Lee
Radziwill, sister of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. (The owners tried
to resolve the matter by cutting holes in the wall.)
</P>
<P>
   Or this: Mortimer Zuckerman, the co-publisher of The Daily News,
installed a large satellite dish in front of his beachfront home in
East Hampton, which prompted angry protests from a neighbor, which
led to a dispute, which resulted in the dish coming down, which led
the neighbor to commission a sculpture of Don Quixote riding toward
Zuckerman's manse, his jousting staff rising some 50 feet.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the only people in the Hamptons who have never sued
their neighbors,'' joked Jerry Della Femina, the advertising
executive and restaurateur, who lives two houses down from
Zuckerman. Technically, Della Femina is telling the truth. But it
is also true that he once sued the village of East Hampton, and
that he keeps a life-size cardboard blowup of him being led off in
handcuffs for displaying pumpkins in front of his food market.
</P>
<P>
   For all the griping, there are few signs of an exodus from the
Hamptons. The author Kurt Vonnegut, who lives near the Rennert
compound, has told friends that ``the Hamptons are finished.'' He
hasn't moved yet. Nor have dozens of other celebrities from the
worlds of fashion, art, business and film. Alec Baldwin has
practically made a second career of writing cranky letters to the
local papers.
</P>
<P>
   For all the fuss, the old rhythms of Hamptons life endure.
Parents still take their children on pilgrimages to The Fudge
Company in Southampton. The town historian in East Hampton still
leads walking tours by the light of a lantern. Residents continue
to take up collections for worthy causes _ such as new sails for
the picturesque windmills that dot the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   And always, there is the scene at the beaches, still ranked
among the finest in the United States. Late Sunday morning, a young
woman in an aqua bikini and Chanel sandals walked up to lifeguard
Paul Gebbin and asked him to rub suntan lotion on her back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Mexico last week and got fried,'' she said, as
Gebbin, who works during the week as a prison guard, took his sweet
time with the lotion.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't want crowds, there is always peace to be
found behind the tall privet hedges that surround many of the
mansions. This is so at Della Femina's place, just around the
corner from Martha Stewart's home on Lily Pond Lane in East
Hampton. Late Sunday night, Della Femina stood on his stretch of
beach, smoking a cigar, watching his friends enjoy the sunset and a
bonfire. Whenever there's a storm, he said laughing, sand from
Calvin Klein's place washes down on his beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get designer sand!'' he said in a way that suggests life is
good.
</P>
<P>
   Realtors keep calling him with tempting news about the value of
his house, which he bought for $3 million in 1987. They tell him he
could get $10 million, $11 million, $12 million. Up, up, up.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are a man like Jerry Della Femina, you think about
how much it would cost to buy the same sort of place in Nantucket
or some other playground, and you think about being 100 miles from
Manhattan, and you come to the only possible answer to such
blandishments: ``It's fake money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bonfire is burning low, and the setting seems so common, so
suburban, if you overlook the fact that Della Femina's home was in
that day's New York Post, which published a ``Key to Celebrity
Homes'' in the Hamptons. (His came just after Steven Spielberg's
and before Sting's.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants Godiva s'mores?'' called out his wife, Judy Licht, a
television reporter for WABC, after she had run out of Hershey's
chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   It is like some scene out of a J. Crew catalog, except there's a
double agent here. Her name is Jodi Della Femina, the 31-year-old
daughter of Della Femina. As the owner of the East Hampton
Independent newspaper, she's a true Hamptons insider. But she also
has just written ``Jodi's Shortcuts '99,'' which offers helpful
hints on how to penetrate all the Hamptons' defenses, including,
most flagrantly, how to avoid traffic by threading the maze of
Hamptons backroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually wrote step-by-step instructions,'' she said. ``This
is, like, criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Della Femina has her rationalizations for the book _ ``Why
should everybody have to go to the same three restaurants when
there are 200?'' _ but she knows the argument is suspect, and she
expects to pay a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've given up some of my true favorite farm stands, and I know
I'm going to have to wait in line now,'' she saod.

AFTER CONGRESS, STILL TRYING TO BRING GENERAL ELECTRIC GOOD
THINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For 20 years, Gerald Solomon represented the 22nd
Congressional District in upstate New York with such pro-business
gusto that environmentalists dubbed him ``the congressman from
General Electric.'' It was not meant as a compliment, but Solomon,
a former Marine, proudly wore the sobriquet like a medal.
</P>
<P>
   Today, six months after Solomon, a Republican, retired from
Congress, the nickname fits better than ever: He is now a lobbyist
for General Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   GE is not the only familiar name in Solomon's new stable of
clients. A staunch supporter of both the timber and dairy
industries in Congress, Solomon now represents both as a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been tremendously successful, in my eyes,'' Solomon, 68,
said in a recent interview. But Solomon's successes are not welcome
in all eyes. Groups that monitor congressional ethics say it is
just the latest case of a longstanding but growing trend: members
of Congress who step out of office and into lobbying jobs for
industries whose positions they had been advocating just months,
even weeks, before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the classic revolving-door problem,'' said Don Simon,
acting president of Common Cause, a government watchdog group.
``The fact that they were colleagues and often remain friends of
those in Congress certainly can give them not just entree, but also
enhanced influence with very important people.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 128 former members of Congress and scores of former
top congressional aides are now working as lobbyists in Washington,
pulling down six-figure salaries that are often quadruple or more
what they earned in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon's own small company, the Solomon Group, is affiliated
with a lobbying firm headed by former Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon is not alone among recent retirees from the New York
delegation to join the lobbying ranks. Former congressman Bill
Paxon, a five-term Republican of western New York who retired last
year, has joined the law and lobbying firm founded by Robert
Strauss, the former Democratic National Party chairman. And former
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a three-term Republican who was defeated last
year, has gone into consulting work for companies like MBNA America
Bank, whose fights he carried in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   By law, former members of Congress cannot directly lobby
Congress for one year after retiring. Paxon and D'Amato have not
yet registered as lobbyists, describing their work as strategic
consulting. And Solomon, though he has registered, says he is only
lobbying Clinton administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon offers no apologies, saying that he considers the ethics
rules barring him from lobbying Congress for one year
unconstitutional. ``You can't deprive a person of their income,''
he said. ``I'm going to work until I'm 85.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the relationships he developed in Congress,
where he was chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee, will
help his clients. But he asserted that access did not guarantee
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said he quit Congress largely to make enough money to
leave a substantial estate for his five children and six
grandchildren. Having sold off his shares of insurance, stock and
real estate businesses when he entered Congress, and then having
put five children through college, he said he has almost no savings
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``My former partners made fortunes,'' he said. ``And I left the
Congress after 20 years worth less than when I came.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to reveal his income this year, saying only that he
had turned down offers to join big firms as a ``show horse'' who
could have made $600,000 annually. Asked if that meant he would
earn less than that this year, Solomon laughed and said, ``The
year's not over.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress earn $136,700 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Solomon often defended General Electric in its
long-running battle to avoid dredging toxic polychlorinated
biphenyls, or PCBs, that the company has acknowledged dumping into
the upper Hudson River two decades ago. Dredging could cost
hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, who now splits his weeks between Washington and his
Lake George, N.Y., home, said he is not lobbying on the dredging
issue, but might in the future. His lobbying disclosure form also
listed work on the reauthorization of the Superfund program.
General Electric is pushing to change a Superfund provision that
can require companies to pay for damage caused by their pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said he endorsed the company's positions in Congress,
and still does, because they were supported by most farmers and
officials in his district. ``I am very proud that they were
positions I never veered from,'' he said. ``That's one of the
things I was known for. I never changed from being a hawk to a
dove.''

CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER AT MICROSOFT TAKES A LEAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's chief technology
officer, will take a yearlong sabbatical to pursue his own
scientific research and travel, the company announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft made the announcement after several news
organizations, including Time magazine, reported that Myhrvold was
leaving after a falling out with Microsoft's president, Steven
Ballmer. Microsoft executives, however, said the reports were
inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Myhrvold, who was the founder of Microsoft's research division,
joined the company in 1986 as director of special projects. He
became a Microsoft executive after the software company acquired
Dynamical Systems Research, a software company he had founded with
his brother, Cameron Myhrvold, who also became a Microsoft
executive.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Myhrvold founded Microsoft Research, and expanded the
effort with laboratories in England and China. Before becoming
chief technology officer in 1996, he was group vice president in
the company's applications and content group and was a key
contributor to Microsoft's early online and consumer efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Microsoft's efforts in the so-called content business
have been disappointing, and when the company announced a
broad-ranging reorganization earlier this year, Myhrvold was not a
member of an executive management group that reported directly to
Gates.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Monday, Myhrvold said that his
successes at Microsoft had outweighed any failures and that he was
leaving on his own decision, not because of corporate political
infighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about doing this for two or three years,''
he said. ``I was looking for the right time for the company, but
both Bill and I realized that there would never be a perfect
time.''

EDITORIAL: TRIAL FOR CAMPAIGN REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 1:
</P>
<P>
   It was hard enough to keep a straight face when House Speaker
Dennis Hastert declared that there was no time for campaign finance
reform, especially since he said it while the House was preparing
for its vacation. Even funnier was the sanctimonious lecture last
week by Tom DeLay to the half-dozen Republicans who defied Hastert
and signed a petition to force the Shays-Meehan reform bill to the
floor of the House. DeLay seemed to suggest that by standing up for
principle, these reformers were committing lese-majeste against
their speaker. But the issue here is not Hastert's dignity. It is
whether his party has a soul.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Shays is the Connecticut Republican whose bill
passed the House last year after surviving delaying tactics similar
to those now being used by Hastert and DeLay, the party whip. As
Shays obliquely observed, it is not Hastert who runs the show but
DeLay, a partisan infighter from Texas who is the GOP's biggest
fund-raiser and most important liaison with the special interests
that benefit so handsomely from the porous system of campaign
financing that Shays is trying to change.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay is also disingenuous. Even as he lectures Shays about
loyalty, he undercuts the speaker on Kosovo. When right-wing
Republicans block spending bills pushed by Hastert, they get no
lectures from DeLay. Instead, the House adjourns and goes home.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of campaign financing, however, DeLay is
consistently shameless. As if the loopholes in the current
fund-raising laws were not big enough, he and his allies are now
scheming to set up a new committee to raise $25 million without
disclosing any information on the donors or how the money is spent.
The current law, parts of which have been in effect since 1907,
bars donations from corporations and labor unions to individual
political candidates and places strict ceilings on funds from
individual donors. The Shays-Meehan bill would ban unregulated
donations to parties and bar donations to independent groups to pay
for television ads. DeLay's plan for another ``independent'' group
is nothing less than a proposal to create a clandestine and corrupt
slush fund.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of DeLay's scheme is that it comes at a time when
Republicans are attacking the 1996 Clinton re-election campaign for
accepting money that was traced to China. But if the plan succeeds,
foreign money will inevitably find its way into the system, and no
one will know because it will not be disclosed. The Democrats are
seeking a Justice Department ruling to stop DeLay's efforts.
Congress can close the loophole outright by passing the
Shays-Meehan bill.
</P>
<P>
   Five Republicans joined with Shays to sign the petition to force
the bill to the floor: Michael Forbes of New York, Mike Castle of
Delaware, Greg Ganske of Iowa, Constance Morella of Maryland and
Nancy Johnson of Connecticut. Democrats have signed up 196 members,
so that 16 more signatures are needed. Marge Roukema of New Jersey
and Zach Wamp of Tennessee say they want fast action. Why have they
not signed?
</P>
<P>
   The same could be asked of Bob Franks, Frank LoBiondo, Rodney
Frelinghuysen and Jim Saxton of New Jersey and Sue Kelly, James
Walsh, Sherwood Boehlert, Amo Houghton and Benjamin Gilman of New
York. To paraphrase an old 1960s slogan, if you're not part of the
effort to get this bill to the floor, you're part of the problem. &QL;

ALTON PETERS, 64, LAWYER WHO LED OPERA GUILD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Conn., Maine)  (mk) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alton Peters, a Manhattan lawyer and philanthropist
who was a passionate champion of opera, died Sunday at his home in
Manhattan. He was 64 and also had homes in Falls Village, Conn.,
and on Mount Desert Island in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his wife, Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   Peters was a partner in the Manhattan law firm of Kelley Drye &AMP;
Warren, which he joined in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   From 1986 until his death, he was the president of the
Metropolitan Opera Guild, on whose board he had served since 1965.
The Guild provides educational programs for the Met, publishes the
magazine Opera News, and runs the gift shop and other marketing
projects, and Peters expanded all those activities. He was also a
member of the Metropolitan Opera Association's executive committee.
Mrs. Peters said that opera had become his great love when he
listened to the Met radio broadcasts as a student.
</P>
<P>
   But he was active in a wide range of other causes. He was the
chairman of Goodwill Industries of Greater New York, and was on the
boards of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, the Academy of
American Poets, the Animal Medical Center and many other
organizations. He also staunchly supported the English-Speaking
Union and other groups that fostered relations between England and
the United States, and in 1982 was made an officer in the Order of
the British Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Peters was born in Albany, where his father, Emil, served as a
general counsel to General Electric. His maternal grandfather,
Joseph Rosch, was a justice of the New York state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Peters was a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, who is the youngest daughter of Irving
Berlin, he is survived by a daughter, Rachel Peters of New York; a
stepdaughter, Emily Fletcher of London, and two granddaughters.

WILLIAM RINGEL, 97, HEADLINE-MAKING JURIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William Ringel, who ruled Andy Warhol's ``Blue
Movie'' obscene, lectured civil rights protesters on the evils of
anarchy and sent a parade of slumlords, thieves and vagrants to
jail in 25 years as a judge in Criminal Court and other lower
courts in New York, died on Thursday at his apartment in Manhattan.
He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   The German-born jurist was the U.S. Army's chief
counterintelligence officer in Austria and Italy during World War
II, helped to organize the food-and-fuel relief effort for his
native Vienna after the war, and later was active in
German-American affairs. He helped found New York's Steuben Day
Parade, celebrating German-American culture, and was its grand
marshal for many years.
</P>
<P>
   On the bench, his rulings set no major precedents and he did not
preside over the big murder or corruption cases of his day. But
from 1940 until his retirement in 1971 _ with time out for service
in two wars _ Ringel was a familiar and zesty figure in the
workaday world of jurisprudence in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He sat in Criminal Court, Special Sessions Court, Traffic Court,
Probation Court, Homeless Men's Court, Magistrates Court, Auto
Accident Court and other courts of unlofty jurisdiction, often
presiding over simple bail hearings or arraignments, or judging the
misdemeanors of gamblers, loan sharks, brawlers, drunks,
pickpockets, prostitutes, stowaways and other malefactors.
</P>
<P>
   His cases often made headlines, however, as in 1969 when he was
part of a three-judge panel that called Warhol's ``Blue Movie''
obscene. The judges, after viewing the film, said that its graphic
sex was portrayed ``with no redeeming social value.''
</P>
<P>
   In the social-political upheavals of the 1960s, protesters
charged with disorderly conduct often faced Ringel, who typically
handed them stern lectures and suspended sentences. ``You cannot
decide what laws to obey and what laws to disobey,'' he told seven
clergymen, a seminarian and a social worker arrested in a 1963
protest against racial discrimination. ``If you don't like a law,
the remedy is to go to the Legislature.'' But he let them go.
</P>
<P>
   Eccentricity seemed indigenous to his courtroom. Not long after
his 1940 appointment by Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, for example,
Magistrate Ringel fined himself $2 for a parking violation.
``Guilty as charged,'' he announced, pulling his black robe aside
to dig out two $1 bills for the court clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the anguished cries of a half-dozen devotees of monkeys as
house pets, he ruled in 1949 that five monkeys were ``wild beasts''
that could not be kept in a midtown apartment, but he suspended a
workhouse term against their sobbing owner when he agreed to place
them in a zoo.
</P>
<P>
   And when 43 men in a bewildering array of costumes appeared
before him in 1962, he dismissed charges of ``masquerading to
conceal identity,'' a form of disorderly conduct, on the ground
that they had been seized in a raid at the National Variety Artists
Annual Ball, a real masquerade.
</P>
<P>
   William Edmund Ringel was born in Vienna on Dec. 17, 1901, and
as an infant was brought to New York by his parents and raised in
Yorkville, a section of Manhattan where German was as common as
English. He graduated from City College in 1923, became a city
schoolteacher and attended night courses at New York University to
earn his law degree in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   He practiced law for 11 years before being named to the bench.
His judicial career spanned 31 years, but was interrupted twice _
for four years during and just after World War II, and for two
years in the Korean conflict. He retired with the rank of
lieutenant colonel.
</P>
<P>
   While his courts were frequently reorganized and renamed, Ringel
became a courthouse regular, reappointed by Mayors William O'Dwyer,
Robert Wagner and John Lindsay.
</P>
<P>
   Ringel taught law at the New York Police Academy, and was the
author of numerous articles on the law and several textbooks,
including ``Searches and Seizures, Arrests and Confessions'' (Clark
Boardman Callaghan, 1972, 1981). He was also active in veterans and
German-American organizations and helped found the Steuben Day
Parade in 1958 and was its grand marshal for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement from the bench, Ringel was a hearing
officer for the New York state retirement system, and also worked
for the state as an arbitrator/mediator and a judicial hearing
officer.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, the former Irma Marie Saxl, whom he married in 1926,
died in 1989. He is survived by his daughter, Barbara Simner
Mendenhall, of Saratoga, Calif.; two sisters, Claire Rifkin of
Yonkers, N.Y., and Nettie Fishman of Long Beach, N.Y.; two
grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: THE CITIZENS' RIGHT TO KNOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 1:
</P>
<P>
   After years of talk from the Labor Party about ending Britain's
culture of secrecy, Tony Blair's government has just proposed a
sadly inadequate law governing the disclosure of government
information. In effect, Britain is bucking a trend that has helped
citizens elsewhere learn what their governments are doing and
prevent official misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   In other nations, freedom of information laws have improved the
policy-making process and provided a check against government
abuses. The laws, most of which have been adopted in the past
quarter-century, emphasize that government information belongs to
the people. They accompany other transparency laws, which require
web-site publication of government data or publication of proposed
laws in documents such as the Federal Register or Congressional
Record. Together, these laws have nourished democracy by
restricting government powers to withhold important information.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden approved the first freedom of information law in 1766,
stating that anyone could go to a government agency and look up
documents in the files. Today at least 15 countries and Hong Kong
have such laws, including Hungary and several Western European and
Asian countries and former British colonies. South Africa's new
democratic government put freedom of information in the country's
new Constitution, and is now facing the challenge of financing a
law and developing ways for citizens who cannot read or write to
make oral requests. Japan is the latest to pass a freedom of
information law, spurred in part by its Health Ministry's slowness
in dealing with HIV-tainted blood products, a scandal in which at
least 400 people died.
</P>
<P>
   The United States passed a weak law in 1966, but it was greatly
strengthened in 1974, after Watergate. It requires government
agencies to publish many kinds of information, and allows anyone in
the world to request the release of specific documents. The
government may withhold several types of information, including
material that violates privacy or damages the national security.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's new bill is weaker than previous proposals that both of
Britain's major parties have made, and in some areas even softens
current disclosure laws. It gives public officials the right to
withhold information that relates to the formulation of government
policy, material they believe could prejudice the workings of
government, and even any request they consider ``vexatious.''
</P>
<P>
   No law is perfect. America's Freedom of Information Act works
best for the businesses that are its biggest users and have long
relationships with the agencies they query. Industries the
government regulates, like pharmaceuticals, want early information
about new standards and whatever the government can tell them about
the competition. Some agencies with crucial information, such as
the CIA and the Pentagon, can take five years to respond to a
disclosure request. Agencies routinely underfinance their
information offices, and suffer no penalties for defying the
disclosure law. They also abuse the permitted exceptions, using
them to hide embarrassing behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these flaws, however, Americans have been able to use
freedom of information laws to learn about matters as diverse as
the Bay of Pigs, housing discrimination and safety problems at
nuclear plants. Many government officials admit that even though
they resent disclosure provisions, the laws have given citizens a
fundamental tool to expose and restrain government arrogance.  &QL;

ZITO PUTS WORRIES OUT OF THE WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Barry Zito is fearless and unflappable, as befits
the Top Gun of USC's baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   A few rocky innings are no cause for him to panic. The lanky
left-handed pitcher has been schooled since childhood to view
setbacks as nothing more than turbulence, a natural part of the
ascent into the clear blue yonder.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Zito's composure never cracked over the weekend. Not
when he loaded the bases in the fourth inning of an NCAA regional
game against Pepperdine on Saturday and had to beat back the heart
of the Waves' order.
</P>
<P>
   And not afterward when, having earned the 5-3 win against
Pepperdine with a gutsy 81/3 inning performance, he headed straight
to the hospital to check on his mother, Roberta, who is seriously
ill and awaiting a liver transplant.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Mike Gillespie said that Zito's focus _ he has won 11
straight games to run his record to 12-2 _ in the face of his
mother's illness ``has been amazing, quite frankly. It has to be a
major issue for him, but he doesn't betray his feelings. He has
been stalwart, composed beyond his years.''
</P>
<P>
   To maintain a fixed emotional attitude under the circumstances
is no small feat. Striking out 16 batters in back-to-back,
seven-inning appearances, as Zito did earlier this season? That's
nothing, next to holding steady emotions that should be rising and
dipping precipitously as a plane in a holiday air show.
</P>
<P>
   Zito has pitched defending national champion USC to the cusp of
a second consecutive College World Series appearance and he is on
the verge of fulfilling his dream of becoming a first-round pick in
Wednesday's amateur draft. The skies would be blue for as far as
the 21-year-old could see, if only his mother's prognosis weren't
so clouded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough,'' Zito said. ``It seems like I'm in some
state of denial. I keep telling myself she's OK. Then when I see
her, the seriousness of her illness kind of hits home.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Zito, 55, is an ordained minister and mother of three.
She is possessed with a personality so sunny it warms every life
she touches. Until her liver betrayed her, she didn't have an ounce
of venom in her body. And then one day last week, 32 ounces of
toxin-laced fluids had to be drained from her.
</P>
<P>
   From the day he arrived on campus back in January, Zito has kept
mostly mum about his mom's illness. The first inkling his USC
teammates had that there was anything amiss came about a month ago
when Zito abruptly skipped out on a game to return to his family's
home in San Diego. That same weekend, his mother was placed on the
organ-transplant list.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta is one of 55,000 people in the U.S. awaiting a
lifesaving organ transplant. A new name is added to the list every
18 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball parlance, Zito's mother is down to her final three
outs. The past few weeks, her condition has deteriorated to the
point where doctors have assured Joe Vito, Barry's father and
Roberta's husband of 34 years, that she's eligible for the first
compatible liver that comes into the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, while Barry was struggling with his control, his
mother was laboring to breathe. The fluids that weren't being
processed by her liver were building up and pressing against her
lungs, resulting in her respiratory difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Her skin is jaundiced and her body bloated. Zito hardly
recognizes his mother until she sees him and smiles. Then she is
just as he always has known her:
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest fan,'' Zito said.
</P>
<P>
   When he visits his mother at Cedars-Sinai, the first thing
she'll do is ask about his day, as though she were reclining on the
family-room sofa instead of a hospital bed with tubes going in and
out of her nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom's a really unselfish person,'' Zito said. ``She tries
to not talk about herself. When we talk, it's always about
baseball. I have to try to force things out of her about herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Zito, a man not given to doing anything halfway, has been
the architect of his son's baseball career, there's no question of
that. Just as there's no getting around the fact that all Zito
needed to succeed, he got from both his parents. The unconditional
support and encouragement came from his mother. The fundamentals
and the single-minded focus were his dad's domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always the one nit-picking,'' Joe Zito conceded Monday.
``And Roberta would be the one saying, `It's not that serious,
Barry.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying the gravity of his mother's condition. Zito
doesn't even try. Thanks to the focus drilled into him by his dad,
he's coping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' Zito said. ``I'll be at home and I'll have all
these thoughts in my head. When I'm on the mound, all of those
thoughts are cast aside. It's remarkable, actually, that the body
can do that. Thank God there's enough distractions on the field. It
is kind of an escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Zito has developed coping mechanisms of her own. On
Saturday, Zito's sister Sally phoned their mother's hospital room
with regular baseball updates. Roberta Zito had made her daughter
promise that she would.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mother's strong,'' said another sister, Bonnie. ``Just
like Barry.''

`SATURDAY NIGHT': EARLY, UNDISCOVERED SONDHEIM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., N.Y.)  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ For Sondheim groupies, the in place to be these days
is a utilitarian theater on the campus of a little-known college in
a nondescript Chicago neighborhood. That is where ``Saturday
Night,'' a 45-year-old musical with a book by an author of
``Casablanca'' and a thoroughly enchanting score by a young man who
was yet to make his mark on the musical theater, is having an
understated _ and long overdue _ American debut.
</P>
<P>
   If for no other reason than that it represented 25-year-old
Stephen Sondheim's first stab at a full-blown commercial musical,
``Saturday Night'' would be worth the trip to Truman College and to
this production by the Pegasus Players, the tiny Chicago troupe to
which Sondheim entrusted the material and for which he has written
two new songs. Blessedly, though, the show is no mere peek at
messy, fraying pages from Sondheim's discard pile. ``Saturday
Night'' is a musical comedy of beguiling innocence that hints at a
composer's promise in every downy-smooth and stylish number.
</P>
<P>
   The musical, based on the play ``Front Porch in Flatbush,'' by
Julius and Phillip Epstein, was to open on Broadway in 1955, but
the death of its young producer, Lemuel Ayers, that summer sealed
the fate of a venture that had already been greeted only tepidly in
backers' auditions. In the intervening years, several songs from
the show, including ``Isn't It?'' ``What More Do I Need?'' and the
title number's wry salute to restless bachelorhood, have made it
into cabaret acts and Sondheim anthology evenings. But it was not
until 1997 that Sondheim would authorize a full production, by the
Bridewell, a fledgling London company that had demonstrated an
affinity for the composer's work. (A version on compact disk has
been released by First Night Records and BMG Classics.)
</P>
<P>
   Now Sondheim has pried open the door for Pegasus, a troupe that
has staged several of his musicals. He spent a day with the company
during rehearsals, enlisted his longtime collaborator Jonathan
Tunick to create new orchestrations, added two ensemble numbers
(``Delighted I'm Sure'' and ``Montana Chem'') and even served as
editor, slashing Julius Epstein's book back to a manageable two and
a quarter hours.
</P>
<P>
   Has it been worth the new attention? Yes, absolutely. Though the
book remains a bit static and the direction by Gary Griffin is
stodgy, ``Saturday Night'' is a cold engine that turns over
miraculously whenever the band begins to play. With its treatment
of the amorous mishaps of a group of average Joes and Janes, and
the clean, character-defining songs that playfully introduce us to
a landscape more familiar to devotees of kitchen-sink drama than
musical comedy, ``Saturday Night'' has the unmistakable stamp of
shrewd imagination and originality. And for fans of Sondheim, it
packs something extra: the heart-stopping sensation of a curtain
going up on genius.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1950s musical universe of Siamese kings and Polynesian
temptresses, ``Saturday Night'' must have seemed weirdly unexotic,
a ``Marty'' among musicals. Set in 1929 on the eve of the stock
market crash, it tells the story of Gene Gorman, a Wall Street
clerk from Brooklyn, who is so intent on accumulating wealth that
he pretends to have some, dressing in tuxedos and crashing affairs
at the Plaza. At the hotel doors, Gene, played with an adolescent
charm by Ian Brennan, meets Helen Fogel (Elizabeth Sayre Yeats), a
woman who, though unknown to Gene, is from his neighborhood and
puts on the airs of a Southern belle. Helen's wavering willingness
to put up with Gene's scheming is the thin crux of the tale.
</P>
<P>
   It is Brooklyn, not the Plaza, that this musical seeks to
infiltrate, and it accomplishes that splendidly right off the bat
with the title number, sung by Gene's cronies, bemoaning their
chronic lack of romantic entanglement. ``Alive and alone on a
Saturday night is dead,'' they sing in the sweet outer-borough
bluntness that is one of the show's refreshing hallmarks. These are
the primordial models for the comradely men evoked again and again
in Sondheim's lyrics and musicals, from the Jets in ``West Side
Story'' to the songwriting team in ``Merrily We Roll Along'' to the
Baker in ``Into the Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   The astonishing gift for interior and unusual rhyming _
``peignoirs'' and ``Renoirs''; ``supine'' and ``new pine'' _ is
readily apparent, as are some of what would become the composer's
signature song styles: skillful mimicking of other genres,
demonstrated here in ``A Moment With You,'' a parody in the style
of Rudy Vallee; the exquisitely detailed list song (``Exhibit A,''
a template for ``Now'' in ``A Little Night Music''); the sobering
ballad (``So Many People'').
</P>
<P>
   If that were not sufficient, there is ``That Kind of a
Neighborhood,'' with its superb anthem to a much-maligned borough:
``Brooklyn, the pride of/The thorn in the side of/New York,'' and
``What More Do I Need?,'' one of the best songs ever written about
the utter madness of opting for city living.
</P>
<P>
   Given the limitations of Epstein's book _ the plot, at once
prosaic and convoluted, ends unconvincingly in a police station _ a
director needs to take this material strongly in hand. Griffin, a
Chicago director whose production of ``Beautiful Thing'' is to
close soon at the Cherry Lane Theater in Greenwich Village, is far
too timid; there is a generic feel to the effort to conjure a
specific time and place. Moreover, his young actors seem a bit
intimidated, as if they were abundantly aware of the importance of
the occasion. (The Chicago audience by contrast seems hardly aware
of it; the O'Rourke Center at Truman College was only about half
full for Friday night's performance.)
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, a Loyola University undergraduate, has the hungry,
open-faced appeal, if not the magnetism, necessary for the
opportunistic Gene; Ms. Yeats sings prettily, even if her put-on
Southern accent for the amusing ``Isn't It?'' isn't put-on enough.
Among their colleagues, Charles Karvelas is ideally cast as Gene's
cheapskate buddy Ray; Philip Dawkins brings polish and an
old-fashioned show-biz spirit to his solo number ``Exhibit A,'' and
best of all is Samantha Fitschen's Celeste, half of the show's
secondary romantic couple. Her no-frills rendition of ``I Remember
That,'' a song eerily close to ``I Remember It Well'' from
``Gigi,'' is effortlessly funny, a bright window on how the warming
effect of the whole show might be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   An evening with Sondheim's Brooklynites in Chicago leaves one
issue unresolved: why ``Saturday Night'' is not yet being produced
in the city that inspired it.

COMMENTARY: WHY SHOULD DAY TRADERS HAVE ALL THE FUN? 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The race is on to be the first to offer late-night stock
trading. The New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and a number of small
electronic competitors have the same brilliant idea _ let people
trade stocks until 10 p.m. If television networks think nighttime
is prime time, why should Wall Street be any different?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, few people on Wall Street much like the idea, for
reasons good and bad. But given the competitive pressures, and the
unwillingness of the Securities and Exchange Commission to block
it, nighttime trading is likely to be here by Labor Day, and will
probably expand after that. Why not midnight madness?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that such trading makes no sense for real
investors, who are looking for the best price on a stock they plan
to own for some time. But those investors are a declining part of
the market. In-and-out trades, with the hope of snaring quick
profits, are all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   Companies fear their employees are sitting in front of their
computers all day trading Internet stocks, rather than doing
whatever it was they were hired to do. Why not let these traders do
their thing on their own time? In addition, those poor souls who
actually have to work during the day could share in the fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The online firms think their customers want to trade when they
get home from work,'' says one person involved in the planning.
``They want to have the fun of hitting the button and getting an
execution.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason most investors would be better off sticking to normal
trading hours is that they benefit from having other investors
there to provide liquidity and make markets more competitive. When
people interested in buying and selling something are concentrated
together, both buyers and sellers are likely to get better prices
than if they have to rely on middlemen who shave off profits from
both sides. That is why medieval towns had market days.
</P>
<P>
   It is also why 24-hour trading has never caught on for
professional money managers, even though it is available because
major stocks trade in markets around the world. The pros know that
they will get the best price if they trade when and where a lot of
others are also trading.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals who trade at night are likely to find that with
fewer people active in the market, the spreads will be wider
between the prices buyers pay and those sellers get. Their loss
will be a gain for brokerage firms that serve as middlemen, but
some of those firms fear they will not make enough from the extra
volume to offset the costs of hiring a night staff.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that only the more active larger companies will be
traded at the start. But you can bet that such barriers will soon
fall. The night traders will crave the excitement of Internet
stocks, and ways will be found to give it to them.
</P>
<P>
   Since the SEC has decided not to try to stop nighttime trading,
the least it can do is try to make sure the gamblers (sorry;
investors) know the risks. Traders should be advised, on the screen
where they trade, that markets may be more liquid the next morning,
and be told that the order will be held for the next regular
session unless they specifically direct it to be executed at night.
</P>
<P>
   While the idea of stock trading as a leisure-time activity may
seem strange to many, it is not a new one. In the 1920s, as now, an
exciting new technology made it far easier to trade stocks while
also providing exciting speculative stocks that led a great bull
market. That technology was radio.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1929, trading on board ocean liners was all the
rage. On the liner Berengaria, which was at sea when the 1929 crash
started, one woman was said to have lost $160,000 on Oct. 24, but
made back most of that through active trading the following day,
when prices briefly rallied. Passengers filled the ship's brokerage
office, where prices were put on a blackboard, and a large crowd
gathered outside. It was a ``death watch,'' one passenger said.
</P>
<P>
   After the crash, the number of people trading stocks on ocean
liners fell sharply. Bear markets just aren't as much fun.

WILLIAM LAWLEY, 78, WON MEDAL OF HONOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Texas, Mass., Ga.)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Col. William Lawley Jr., who won the Medal of Honor in World War
II for flying a crippled bomber with wounded crewmen safely back to
England despite his multiple wounds, died on Sunday at a hospital
in Montgomery, Ala., his hometown. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications of pneumonia, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Feb. 20, 1944, the Allies began Big Week, the
war's most extensive bombing of Germany's aircraft industry. Among
the more than 1,700 planes taking off from England that day was
Cabin in the Sky, a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber piloted by Lawley,
then a lieutenant in the 305th Bomb Group of the Army Air Forces.
</P>
<P>
   Lawley was assigned to attack a plant at Leipzig assembling
Messerschmitt fighter planes, but a malfunction prevented release
of his bombs. As he left the target area, flying at 28,000 feet, 20
German fighters attacked his four-engine plane, which was being
flown in combat for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The shells killed the co-pilot, wounded the other eight crewmen,
left Lawley with deep cuts on his face, neck and hands, set an
engine ablaze, damaged a wing and sent the bomber into an almost
vertical dive.
</P>
<P>
   Lawley forced the co-pilot's body off the control column, fought
for control of the plane while bleeding severely and leveled off at
12,000 feet. Fearing that his plane would explode, he rang a bell
signaling his crewmen to bail out, but was told that two of them
were wounded so badly that they could not use their parachutes.

   He lost the help of his flight engineer, who bailed out, but
Lawley decided to try to reach England. Although almost five hours
of flying over enemy-held territory were ahead of him, he saw no
other way to save the badly wounded crewmen.
</P>
<P>
   After extinguishing the engine fire, Lawley avoided German
fighters by flying in the clouds. Harry Mason, his bombardier, tied
the co-pilot's body to his seat back with a parka to keep the
already-damaged instrument panel clear, then stood between the two
cockpit seats and helped Lawley with the controls.
</P>
<P>
   Having refused first aid, Lawley collapsed from loss of blood
and exposure over occupied France. After being revived by Mason, he
was finally able to release his bombs, lightening the load and
saving fuel, as the plane approached the English Channel.
</P>
<P>
   But as the English coast loomed, with one engine already having
burned, a second engine ran out of gasoline and then a third engine
caught fire. Lawley was left with only one working engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was looking for an open pasture,'' Ralph Braswell, one of
the plane's two waist gunners, recalled Monday from his home in
Bremen, Ga. ``All of a sudden, there was a Canadian fighter field.
He flashed the emergency signal and we went right in.''
</P>
<P>
   All the wounded crewmen survived a crash landing at Redhill, a
small fighter strip south of London. The flight engineer who had
parachuted out was captured, but also survived the war.
</P>
<P>
   The following August, Lawley received the Medal of Honor.

   William Robert Lawley Jr., a native of Leeds, Ala., entered
flight training in 1942 and went overseas the next year. He was on
his 10th bombing mission when attacked by the German fighters, then
flew four more missions before being sent back to the United States
for a tour promoting the sale of war bonds. He served in the Air
Force until 1972, then retired as a colonel.
</P>
<P>
   Lawley is survived by his wife, Amy; a son, William III, of
Dallas; two daughters, Susan Decker of Sudbury, Mass., and Anne
Sheftic of Dadeville, Ala; a brother, J.D. Lawley of Moody, Ala.,
and five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Lawley kept in touch with the crewmen he saved.
Braswell, the gunner that February day in 1944, visited him
recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had arthritis,'' Braswell remembered, ``but after I shook
his hands, I said, `They're beautiful. They saved my life.'''
