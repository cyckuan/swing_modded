<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tottenville High School, at the southern tip of
Staten Island, has one of largest expanses of artificial turf in
the world, a sprawling $7.3 million hyper-green carpet on which it
can conduct three major sporting events at once without conflict.
At Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn, the sports program
went broke last spring, forcing school principal Lena Medley to beg
the PTA for a handout.
</P>
<P>
   Students and alumni at Tottenville raised most of the cost of a
$5 million field house last year through donations of cash, labor
and material. Coaches at Jefferson raise $20, on a good day,
selling coffee and doughnuts outside the school office to buy
uniforms for the track and soccer teams.
</P>
<P>
   Both schools get the same funds from the city: about $2,500 for
all their teams for a whole year, not counting stipends for
coaches. And while Tottenville, with 3,800 students, raised about
$75,000 from the local community to make its program the envy of
the city, Jefferson, with 1,500 students, struggled to raise
$10,000 to try to get by.
</P>
<P>
   Neither school gets enough money or support from the city for
even a minimal athletic program. Where they differ is in how they
face that problem, and in the consequences that play out in the
lives of students and teachers and coaches in two deeply dissimilar
corners of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Sports at Tottenville and Jefferson, in their individual stories
of scramble and struggle, reflect the economic health of their
communities and the apathy or enthusiasm of coaches and parents.
And the city's school sports program makes no attempt to even
things out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some got it, some don't _ that's essentially it,'' said
Jefferson's head football coach, Keith Merriman, who had to tell
his team this year _ for the first time in a 22-year coaching
career _ that there wasn't even enough money to buy new football
jerseys, and that last year's would have to be used. ``In a lot of
instances, you're paying for where your school happens to be
located, not for what you can do as a coach, or even what kind of
kids you have in your program,'' Merriman said.
</P>
<P>
   Sports in the New York City public schools once offered a
mechanism for bridging the lives of young people from different
backgrounds. A team traveling to another school for a game could be
reminded that kids are kids, and that there are often more
similarities that unite than differences than divide. But that
bridge has become harder and harder to provide. As the burden of
maintaining school athletics has been shifted to the schools over
the last two decades, places like Tottenville and Jefferson really
have become independent and different.
</P>
<P>
   The stark differences in New York's neighborhoods _ economic as
well as cultural _ have been underlined and emphasized by its
public-school sports programs, rather than diminished. School
sports, under such conditions, are evolving differently in each
place, as schools search for a path forward.
</P>
<P>
   At Tottenville, for example, about one out of four students this
year is participating in a school sport _ more than 1,000
teen-agers on 41 different teams, from freshman baseball to
handball and fencing. At Jefferson, 22 miles away and in the heart
of East New York, only one student out of eight participates _ 180
boys and girls on 18 teams.
</P>
<P>
   At Tottenville, students ride buses to events. At Jefferson,
they mostly take public transportation or ride with their coaches _
violating school-system rules _ because chartered buses are not an
option.
</P>
<P>
   There were always differences between New York high schools, of
course _ some had good teams, some didn't. But the new inequality
extends beyond final scores and good and bad teams. Now, there are
the haves and the have-nots. Some schools have access to the money
needed to run a high-quality athletic program. Others are frozen
out. Some schools can get nice uniforms, and others are reduced, as
was the Brooklyn girls' volleyball team that visited Tottenville
for a game earlier this year, to taping their numbers on old
T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools have playing fields in good repair; others go to
practice with coaches and players holding their breath as to who
might turn an ankle in a rut, or fall on a jagged rock.
</P>
<P>
   But Tottenville and Jefferson also share certain haunting
similarities.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, known to generations of New York students as simply,
``Jeff,'' occupies a massive brick-and-stone building that
dominates its neighborhood. Its tiled hallways and 70-year-old
honor roll plaques resonate with a weighty grandeur, echoing the
decades when its name was associated with all that high school _
both in sports and schooling _ meant in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Stories are still told here about Jefferson legends like
football coach Moe Finkelstein. He retired 12 years ago, but
coaches still remember, even today, how he took his coffee: black.
And if you took it any other way yourself, you were a wimp.
</P>
<P>
   Tottenville's grandeur is different, but just as evident.
Designed in the 1960s to look more like a college campus than an
old-style urban school fortress, it sprawls across the land,
languid in its dominance. There are no metal detectors, no guards
patrolling the halls. Tottenville is about as relaxed as a high
school can be in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both schools are isolated: Jefferson by poverty, Tottenville
by geography. There are no grocery stores or movie theaters or
shopping malls near either one. As institutions, they are both
still powerful landmarks and symbols, but the roles they play in
their very different worlds have diverged.
</P>
<P>
   COMMUNITY ANCHOR: `Small-Town' Lives Focused on Sports  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, when the rest of the New York City school
system was being transformed by an innovation called ``educational
options,'' in which a student could choose a high school other than
the one in his or her own neighborhood, Staten Island held itself
apart. Parents' groups came forward, saying they liked the old
ways. The Board of Education created a system called ``internal
choice'' for the Staten Island schools that allowed them to keep
their traditional roles as community anchors, schools that students
in a given geographic area were expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent in charge of high schools in Staten Island
and Western Brooklyn then, Noel Kriftcher, said he thought that
allowed Tottenville High School to keep its role as the centerpiece
of life on the southern edge of Staten Island. And that, in turn,
has fed back on the school's sports teams, which still stand for
and captivate community and student spirit in a way that much of
New York City has forgot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools in Staten Island are still largely tied to
communities,'' Kriftcher said. ``You don't have that in a lot of
areas of New York City anymore, where schools are smaller or newer
or are no longer identified with a particular community.''
</P>
<P>
   Tottenville is not, by any measure, New York City's richest
neighborhood. The annual income per person in the school's zone is
just slightly higher than that of the city as a whole. But the
winding, often wooded thoroughfares like Hylan Boulevard feel more
like Westchester County or New Jersey. Unemployment is lower than
in the rest of the city, at about 5 percent, and home ownership
rates are higher _ with about three of four residents in the
district owning their own homes, according to the U.S. Census
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger force is stability, residents say. It's easy to
find people whose grandfathers and grandmothers grew up in
Tottenville and never left. More than half of the teachers at the
school have been there for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually a generation picks up and goes, but people here didn't
pull out,'' said Bill Leyes, owner of Tottenville Trading, an
antique shop. ``A lot of us are still together, that's all. I've
been here 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   That stability has also created, or preserved, a kind of
cloistered world. In a vast city where people often barely even
know their neighbors, Tottenville is a small town.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see someone I don't know,'' said Rabiye Tala, a 17-year
old soccer player at Tottenville, ``I think, `How come I don't know
them?'''
</P>
<P>
   And sports _ focused through Tottenville High, like light
through a lens _ is the mechanism that gives small-town Tottenville
its identity and its passion. It's what people have in common.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the Board of Education is distancing itself more
and more from the daily operations of high schools sports,
Tottenville's stubborn retention of old-fashioned sports boosterism
has become an overwhelming trump card that connects directly to
money and student participation and, many coaches in and out of the
school say, to sports victories. In the last six years, the school
has won more than a dozen city championships in football, baseball,
soccer and track.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, sports is not so much an extracurricular activity in
this school as it is an embrace. Local residents, including many
former Tottenville athletes, volunteer to help coach. The annual
sports parade through the center of Tottenville every April is one
of the biggest events of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Mosscuzza, Tottenville's girls' volleyball coach and
assistant athletic director, said she was approached last year
after a game by a little girl _ maybe 6 years old, if that _ who
was probably some 10 years away from high school, but already
hooked by the school's mystique.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `I want to play for Tottenville one day,''' Ms.
Mosscuzza said.
</P>
<P>
   And parents are involved _ sometimes, almost too involved,
coaches say. Their interest is constant, a blanket of sometimes
almost smothering attention that coaches say they value and respect
and can't ever ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who work as stockbrokers and crane operators adjust
their schedules to watch their children play. One father said he
left the company he worked for so he could be a self-employed
consultant who could attend his son's football games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get calls all of the time,'' said Alan Blanc, Tottenville's
athletic director. ``I get calls from parents on freshman teams
wondering why their son isn't playing.'' Sometimes, he added, ``The
parents care more than the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all Tottenville sports, baseball is where that passion rises
to its fever pitch. Parents even come to practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enjoy a cup of coffee and watch them practice,'' said Linda
Maklari, who has two sons on the team. ``We eat, drink and sleep
baseball here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tottenville baseball parents club holds monthly meetings
where guest speakers, including professional players and school
alumni, talk to team members about hitting, training and
schoolwork. When report cards come out, parents and the coach
discuss the players' grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like one giant baseball family,'' Ms. Maklari said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the parents become so close through baseball that they
even take a winter cruise together, a family affair where baseball
remains a topic of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys even bring their gloves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   THE CRUELEST TRUTH: Jefferson's Enemies Are Close at Hand
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tucker, a wisp of a 15-year-old who looked all the
skinnier for his oversize jeans, walked slowly across the field
early last fall, a bag slung over his shoulder. He arrived, still
without speaking a word, in front of Keith Merriman, Jefferson's
head football coach, and methodically unpacked a scuffed pair of
cleats, a set of worn shoulder pads, a faded practice jersey. He
placed them carefully on the grass and rezipped the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Only when he stood back up did he speak, and only then was it
clear why he had waited. Speaking softly, he told the coach he was
sorry, but he couldn't play football anymore because his mother had
just kicked him out of the house and he was, as of that morning in
late August, 10 days before the start of the school year and the
football season, homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Making sports work in New York, more than ever, depends on the
enthusiasm and support of families and communities _ money is just
a reflection and expression of that fact.
</P>
<P>
   And at Thomas Jefferson that is in many ways the cruelest truth.
As much as the coaches and teachers might criticize the city's
sports structure for abandoning the old ideals and standards of
financing, the greater enemy is closer to hand, they say: apathy,
poverty, the collapse of the family and the erosion of what holds a
neighborhood together _ that's what really did in the Orange Wave.
</P>
<P>
   Merriman and junior varsity coach Ernie General glanced at each
other with a deep, familiar weariness as Michael stood before them
that day. What was the story, they asked. Where did his mother
live? Did he have any other relatives? General wrote down names.
Merriman said he would call Michael's mother.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids shouldn't have to deal with this,'' Merriman said,
shaking his head as he watched Michael fade into the distance.
</P>
<P>
   On Jefferson's football squad of 28 boys, only 3 have both
parents at home. And at the team's opening game, coaches said, only
one of those parents came. The football team was unable to raise
the money for new jerseys this year, partly because of the crushing
poverty in this part of the city, but also because the parents'
booster club fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at Jefferson games has also nearly collapsed. Even as
recently as the early 1990s, Saturday football games would attract
500 or more paying fans. Recent games, even with a winning team,
have drawn only a few dozen fans at most games.
</P>
<P>
   And fewer fans, coaches say, have in turn reinforced the
desolation of the school's field on Flatlands Avenue. Prostitutes
who troll the streets of a nearby industrial zone sometimes bring
their customers behind the field. Homeless people have erected
lean-to shelters against a back fence. Even the cheerleaders, who
don't have real uniforms anyway, don't seem to want to come _ they
were only spotted at the Homecoming game.
</P>
<P>
   Holding together a sports program here means a constant search,
coaches and administrators say, for ways to connect to a
disconnected community. In the school zone that surrounds
Jefferson, nearly half of the adult residents are not in the labor
force, which means they have given up looking for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   East New York had the highest homicide rate in the city last
year. Two-thirds of the residents have no cars, and poverty is
enduring and deep _ more than one in eight of the households in the
school's district earned less than $5,000 in 1997, according to
U.S. Census Bureau figures.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Robinson, Jefferson's athletic director, almost cries
when he tells some of the sports stories that he says result from
such conditions. They are not tales of financial woe for the most
part, but of aborted hope.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, a girl entered the school who made every
coach's head turn, Robinson said. She was 6 feet 5 inches. She had
never played basketball even once in her life, she said. But
Robinson knew that didn't matter, and he went to see her parents,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was from a poor family, and we tried to explain to her
father that this was a means of getting her through college,''
Robinson said. ``We guaranteed her scholarships _ there was no
doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   But the father said no. ``His attitude was that she should come
home and cook dinner,'' Robinson said of the girl's father.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, there are small victories. Michael Tucker's
mother changed her mind after a visit from the Jefferson coaching
staff. She took her son back in and he resumed his spot as a guard
and linebacker on the football team _ never missing a game.
</P>
<P>
   COFFEE AND SYMPATHY: $10 to $20 Daily Lets Students Play  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Sioukas teaches gym every day for his living. But he sells
coffee and doughnuts every morning so that Jefferson High can have
soccer and track. Sioukas and Claudel Martin, Jefferson's track
coach, came up with the idea about three years ago _ a
mini-business that kicks out about $10 to $20 a day in profits for
the combined fund that the coaches and friends call their war
chest. The coffee cart helps pay for uniforms and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   But it has also come to mean more than that at the school. It
has become a vehicle and a rallying point, a new social connection
and a way of making a statement about perseverance and
resourcefulness. Teachers who never talked to each other before say
that they now routinely gather for a moment before the day begins.
Students have volunteered to help with the business, Sioukas said,
and have contributed helpful ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids see you working hard, they want to work hard too,''
Sioukas said.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising for high school sports in New York is not an end in
itself, but rather a mirror that shows how things work. And in the
life of this one coach, stopping at Krispy Kreme every morning at
6:20, pouring cups of coffee and collecting coins _ all the while
reminding himself of why he's doing it _ there is a deep reflection
of values.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson raises about $8,000 to $10,000 a year to run its often
threadbare sports program. It does get some external support: A
nearby church, St. Paul's Community Baptist, has become involved,
local politicians, including the local congressman, Rep. Edolphus
Towns, are occasionally enlisted for help, and the PTA can be
squeezed.
</P>
<P>
   But in a poor neighborhood full of parents who are either
struggling financially or uninvolved with the life of the school _
or both _ Jefferson's coaches and administrators say they have to
depend on themselves to make sports happen. As with the school
itself, with its uniformed officers patrolling the hallways and its
metal detectors _ a legacy of violence in and out of the building _
sports here exists in a kind siege mentality. Surrounded by apathy,
it lives or dies by what can be cultivated inside school walls.
Things like the coffee cart, in which most of the proceeds come
from the faculty, reflect and reinforce the school's isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, the track coach, has a whole closet full of old
sweatsuits in the gym _ collected and saved, tattered but still
usable for athletes who have no other recourse. They're free for
the asking for those who have no other choice but to ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``My coach never had a closet like this,'' he said. ``But now
you have to because some kids just don't have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising at Tottenville includes categories that just don't
exist in East New York: advertising revenue, for example. Local
businesses support the school's sports teams, taking out ads in
regularly published sports guides and game programs. Other stores
provide goods at a discount to the school or to athletes, or donate
them. Free labor and building supplies for construction or repair
projects are abundant.
</P>
<P>
   Money for sports is so available that supply can sometimes
outstrip demand. The Tottenville Little League _ a main feeder for
the school teams _ is so big and so important and such a visible
marketing opportunity that local businesses must put their names on
a waiting list if they want to sponsor a team.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are cake sales at sports events, and raffles, and alumni
fund drives _ a humming network of parents and businesses and
residents that looks to the school as its natural nexus for
donations of time and money. Tottenville even gets more money per
ticket at its football games than Jefferson: $4 a ticket, compared
to $1 to $3 in East New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the catbird seat here,'' said George Kaplan, the
girls' soccer coach. ``If we haven't raised enough money for
something, then the parents just pay for it. There's a lot of
support for the sports teams here, and that's what it's all about.
That makes a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   SUCCESS STORIES: Colleges Come Calling For 2 Hard Workers
</P>
<P>
   Mike Martinez's success on the football field _ he plays both
defense and offense and was voted last month to the New York City
Coach's All-City team as a tight end _ and his satisfactory
performance in the classroom at Jefferson are celebrated in a
school that has struggled in so many ways over the years. He's good
enough to get major recruiting attention from some of the best and
biggest Division I colleges in the nation, and competent enough
academically, in his SAT scores and grades, to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   But his distinctiveness also shows the long dark road that
sports has traveled through at the school. The last time an athlete
won a major college football scholarship was the year Mike was
born, 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The school's attitude about sports has changed as well. What
sports are here, what they mean, and what function they are meant
to perform in the lives of students, is evolving and changing.
Athletics for its own sake is not celebrated the way it once was.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when she came to Jefferson as principal, Ms.
Medley, unilaterally raised the school's academic standards for
eligibility to play on the sports teams. The Public Schools
Athletic League, which regulates public school sports, mandates
that a student must have a 65 percent average in his or her
classes, but Medley boosted it to 75 percent, and laid down other
new rules, as well. Student athletes have to attend daily mandatory
homework sessions with their coach and SAT test-taking workshops on
Saturdays during their sport's season _ miss either one, the new
rules say, and you don't play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago it was felt that the only way for certain people to
get out of certain circumstances and situations was for them to go
into sports,'' Ms. Medley said. ``But today you can get on a
computer and get out of the ghetto a lot quicker than you can
running down the field with a football under your arm. Sports is
being downsized to a certain degree, but that's all right.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mike Martinez, however, the passion for sports is utterly
undiluted. He is shy, soft-spoken and fiercely driven. He does 500
pushups every day in his room, all year long, except during
football season, when he slacks off to 100. His parents, Blanca
Martinez and Michael Stewart, say they have no ready explanation
for the way he is _ unstoppable and relentless _ except that he
just seems to have been born that way.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said that when Mike was little, he used to pick him up
and hold him to look out the window at all the kids running wild
around their housing project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say, `See that? Their parents don't care about them
because they're letting them run around,''' he said. ``You should
be home, or in school, somewhere where you're parents know where
you're at _ I guess that instilled something in him. Pride I
guess.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mike has also been affected by the environment of a school,
and neighborhood, where luxuries and frills are rare. Asked whether
it bothered him, in his triumphal, pivotal senior year _ the year
he was being watched by college coaches and recruiters _ to be
wearing last year's scuffed old jersey, he instantly shook his head
no.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what you wear _ it's how you wear it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Kerri Lynn Piznak was in eighth grade _ on the eve of
heading to Tottenville High _ she went into sports overload.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing everything,'' she said. ``One weekend we went to
Connecticut for a traveling basketball tournament, and my traveling
soccer team was having a tournament there, too _ so I'd play one
basketball game, go to a soccer game, then play another basketball
game and go back to soccer. `It was crazy,' everybody said, `you'll
have to decide what you're really going to do in high school.'''
</P>
<P>
   At Tottenville, Kerri said, the sacrifice of narrowing the field
meant focusing on her three greatest loves: basketball, soccer and
cross-country.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mike Martinez, she is now 17, a senior, and like him, she
is being recruited by colleges around the nation _ for basketball
in her case.
</P>
<P>
   They also seem kindred on another level. They don't let up.
Whatever it is that makes Mike do his pushups is the same
mysterious elixir that drives her to go the gym every Saturday
morning with her father, John, with whom she has trained since she
was in second grade.
</P>
<P>
   Always, she said, the goal was the same: to learn how to go up
and over his outstretched arm in their ritual no-holds-barred game
of one-on-one. And finally, about three years ago, she found a way
to do it.
</P>
<P>
   She has now beaten her father every Saturday morning without
fail since Father's Day 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Kerri, whose schedule is jammed with school activities, awards
and clubs in addition to sports, is also driven by a sense of
injustice.
</P>
<P>
   Even at Tottenville, a school that would seem to have it all,
there are imbalances and inequities, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Kerri decided that the girls' basketball uniforms
were shabby compared to the boys' outfits. The girls also got no
warm-ups as part of their kit, and this, too, rankled.
</P>
<P>
   So Kerri entered an essay contest sponsored by the Women's
Sports Foundation, a national research group, and won $2,500 for
her school, and used just 250 words to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come a long way,'' she wrote in her essay. ``But all is
not yet equal.''

NEW YORK REGENTS LOOK AT PRIVATE SCHOOLS' STANDARDS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a sign of its determination to include nonpublic schools in
its campaign to raise academic standards statewide, the New York
state Board of Regents spent two days this week in an unusual
meeting with leaders of private and religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Private school leaders and state officials said they could not
recall the last time the Regents had devoted so much of their
monthly meeting to the state's 2,400 nonpublic schools. During the
meeting, held Monday and Tuesday at St. John's University in
Queens, members presided over a community forum attended by more
than 70 people, including private school administrators, teachers
and a few parents, and visited 11 schools. They included yeshivas,
Christian schools and a Muslim school.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state does not monitor the nonpublic schools as
closely as public ones, Richard P. Mills, the state education
commissioner, often notes that the law requires him to insure that
every student gets a high-quality education, including the 485,000
in private schools _ 14 percent of the student population.
</P>
<P>
   Private schools must provide a ''substantially equivalent''
education to the local public schools, according to the State
Education Law, but they are largely free to develop their own
approaches to meeting that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Hayden, Regents chancellor, said that without infringing on
the nonpublic schools' independence, the state needed a mechanism
to measure their performance, but stopped short of suggesting an
equivalent to the state ``report cards'' on individual public
schools. To improve the public schools, the Regents have introduced
new assessment tests in both elementary and secondary grades, and
have toughened graduation requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see them take the lead in developing
accountability measures themselves,'' Hayden said of the nonpublic
schools. ``Right now there is a good deal of surmise about their
quality, because nobody knows for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The private schools say they already have a powerful mechanism
to assess their quality: market forces. If their graduates were not
admitted to the best selective middle and high schools or colleges,
parents would abandon them in droves, officials at the private
schools say. Most of those schools give their students the state's
standardized tests and, on the whole, their students' performance
on such tests is better than that of public school students.
</P>
<P>
   More important than measuring school performance, several
private-school leaders said, was establishing better communications
between them and the Regents and the State Education Department,
which has not had an assistant commissioner for nonpublic schools
in several years, because of reductions in state financing.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mills appointed the head of an upstate Muslim school
to his advisory board, a step that Shannon Huber, assistant
principal at Razi School in Queens, said would help address
concerns about communication.
</P>
<P>
   Among the kinds of problems better communications might solve,
for example, is many Muslim schools' displeasure with the
scheduling of the state's fourth-grade reading exam in the middle
of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month. Huber said she decided not to
give the test, which began Tuesday, to her fourth graders, in part
because of the timing.

<P>
   For women with a high risk of breast cancer, a study being
published Thursday offers hope, but at a cruel price. Removing both
breasts while they are still healthy reduces the risk of getting
breast cancer by 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings, from a study of 639 women who had their
breasts removed from 1960 to 1993, are widely regarded as the most
reliable information to date on the long-term effectiveness of the
operation. Surgeons had been performing the procedure, known as
bilateral prophylactic mastectomy on such women, since the 1960s,
assuming it would reduce a woman's cancer risk. But they did not
know whether it really did, or by how much, since there is no
guarantee that all the problem tissue has been removed.
</P>
<P>
   One way that high-risk women can try to protect themselves is by
having regular mammograms and breast examinations in hopes of
detecting the disease early enough to cure it with surgery,
chemotherapy and radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The only other way such women can protect themselves against
breast cancer is by taking the drug tamoxifen, which in a large
study last year was shown to reduce the risk of the disease by
about 45 percent. But women are supposed to take the drug for only
five years because it is thought to be ineffective after that time.
In addition, tamoxifen may cause blood clots or uterine cancer in
some women, and although it reduces the risk of breast cancer,
studies have not shown that it lowers the death rate from the
disease, as mastectomy does.
</P>
<P>
   The new study of the surgery, by researchers at the Mayo Clinic
in Rochester, Minn., is being published Thursday in the New England
Journal of Medicine. The women in the study were considered at high
risk because of a strong family history of breast cancer or a
personal history of breast lumps needing biopsies.
</P>
<P>
   Tests developed in the 1990s to detect genetic mutations also
provide an indication of women who may be at risk.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is a very important paper,'' said Dr. Patrick Borgen,
chief of breast surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
in New York, who was not involved in the study. ``It's the first
credible calculation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Borgen and other cancer experts, including the authors of
the paper, cautioned that the findings should not be used to
pressure women into having their breasts removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study doesn't mean we should sell the surgery to more
women,'' Borgen said. ``But women who are considering it now have a
hard-core fact to use as they're making their calculation.''
</P>
<P>
   The data reflect rates of illness and death for the participants
as a group. Individual women involved in the study, and others who
have undergone the procedure, have no way of knowing whether it
spared them from cancer that might have killed them, or cost them
their breasts to protect them from a disease they would never have
contracted.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lynn Hartmann, a medical oncologist who directed the study
of breast removal, said, ``This report is not meant as a universal
recommendation for this procedure. It's meant to provide data for a
tough and controversial area. I think that to date only a minority
of high-risk women are interested in this procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patricia Ganz, director of the division for cancer
prevention and control research at the Jonsson Cancer Center at the
University of California at Los Angeles, said that despite the
warnings, ``a lot of physicians and surgeons scare women, and there
is fear in the medical community that they will say to women, `You
ought to have your breasts removed.'''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 639 women studied, the researchers concluded that at
least 20 and as many as 40 women would have died if they had not
had their breasts removed. But there were only 2 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara Weber, an expert on breast cancer genetics at the
University of Pennsylvania, and coauthor of an editorial that
accompanied the study, pointed out that although the procedure
theoretically saved 18 lives, 621 other women who had their breasts
removed probably would have survived without the drastic operation.
She also noted the paradox of finding evidence supporting breast
removal in healthy women, when treatments for women who already
have cancer are aimed at saving the breast whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, she and other researchers said, many women with
strong family histories of breast and ovarian cancer are urged to
have their ovaries removed. But that surgery is not disfiguring,
and ovarian cancer, unlike breast cancer, is difficult to detect
early enough to save a woman's life.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Larry Norton, director of the Lauder Breast Center at
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said the study was
convincing and important. But the surgery ``is not for everybody,''
Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like very much to make this not an option, to have
better ways of preventing breast cancer in ways that do not involve
surgery,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   Norton said he hoped studies that would be starting soon,
combining a tamoxifen-like drug and other drugs that manipulate
hormone levels, would provide a risk reduction equal to that shown
for the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The number of women in the United States who have had their
breasts removed in hopes of preventing cancer is not known. There
is no registry of cases. Dr. Hartmann and other researchers said
that women who wanted it tended to be those who had seen mothers,
aunts and sisters die young from breast cancer.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Borgen said there had been a recent increase in interest in the
surgery, but he did not think the number of procedures had risen
with the development during the 1990s of tests for mutations in the
genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, which greatly increase a woman's risk of
developing breast or ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we had a way to identify women who had an 85 percent
chance of developing breast cancer, women said, `What can you tell
me about prophylactic mastectomy?''' Borgen said. ``All we could
say was, `Gee, we think it works. But no studies have been done.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although it might seem reasonable to assume that a woman without
a breasts cannot get breast cancer, proof was needed. Mastectomy
can remove only 90 percent to 95 percent of breast tissue, and many
researchers feared that the tissue left behind might harbor rogue
cells that could one day turn malignant.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hartmann and her colleagues sought to fill the information
gap by conducting a retrospective study, involving women who had
had the surgery in the past, rather than women going through it
now. They used the Mayo Clinic's records to identify 639 women who
had prophylactic mastectomies there from 1960 to 1993. The women
were 18 to 79 years old when they had the surgery, with a median
age of 42 years. Half the women had had the surgery 14 or more
years before, and all had had it at least five years previously.
</P>
<P>
   The team classified 214 of the women as high risk because their
family histories, Dr. Hartmann said. Many had mothers or sisters,
or both, with the disease, and in 150 of their families, there were
three or more breast cancers among close relatives. The women were
not tested for mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, but Dr. Hartmann
said the tests are under way.
</P>
<P>
   High-risk families like the ones identified in the study account
for 5 percent to 10 percent of the 180,000 new cases of breast
cancer diagnosed each year, Dr. Hartmann estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The other 425 study subjects, even though they had their breasts
removed, were considered to have been at only moderate risk. They
had fewer close relatives with the disease than the high-risk women
did, but, Dr. Hartmann said, many had chosen the surgery because of
their own histories of multiple breast lumps that required repeated
biopsies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one is an exercise in anxiety control,'' Dr. Hartmann
said. She said some women with that kind of history reach a point
where they look ahead and see an endless series of painful,
nerve-wracking biopsies, one of which they imagine will finally
give the result they have been dreading all along. And they decide
they might as well get it over with.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers tried to determine how many breast cancers would
have developed and how many women would have died if the surgery
had not been performed. Then they compared the expected numbers to
the real ones.
</P>
<P>
   They did the calculations differently for the two groups of
women. For the 214 at high risk, they compared the women with their
own sisters, who had not undergone the preventive surgery. Since
siblings are similar genetically and usually share the same
environment growing up, they assumed the sisters' risk of breast
cancer would be similar.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of the breast cancers that developed in the
untreated sisters after the subjects had mastectomies, the
researchers calculated that 38 would have been expected in the
subjects. But only three occurred _ a reduction in risk of more
than 90 percent. Similarly, 10 deaths from breast cancer would have
been expected, but only 2 occurred _ an 80 percent risk reduction.
</P>
<P>
   A computer model predicted 37.4 cases of breast cancer among
women in the moderate group, and only four occurred, for a 90
percent reduction in risk. Ten deaths were expected and none
occurred _ a 100 percent risk reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayo Clinic did not disclose the names of women who
participated in the study. But a woman who had the surgery
elsewhere agreed to be interviewed. Staci Mishkin, 40, from
Springfield, Va., was delighted to hear of the study, which, she
said, ``validates what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Ms. Mishkin had both breasts removed. She was
perfectly healthy, but her mother, maternal grandmother and two of
her mother's sisters had died of breast cancer before they reached
50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew growing up, my whole life, that women in my family got
breast cancer and died,'' said Ms. Mishkin, who tested positive for
a mutation in BRCA1. ``It was not a question of, will I get it?''
she said. ``It was a question of when.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mishkin said she had no regrets over having her breasts
removed, and said she believes doctors have been overly hesitant
about recommending the procedure to high-risk women.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't recommend it or not recommend it,'' she said of
her own operation. ``But now, with this study, they can say this
will reduce your risk 90 percent. They'll have to tell their
patients it's an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Susan Love, a breast cancer expert and professor of surgery
at the University of California at Los Angeles, said that, thanks
to the study, ``Women who want to do this know they will at least
have some benefit. But it should drive us hard to find better
prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Love said she did a few prophylactic mastectomies, but only
after several months of discussions with patients. ``Sometimes your
sister or mother gets diagnosed and you're so panicked you want a
quick fix,'' she said. ``I would suggest that women not choose to
do this at that moment in time.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said it was important to remember that seven women in
the study got breast cancer even though their breasts were removed.
``Nobody should come away thinking it's a guarantee,'' she said.

   WASHINGTON _ In the course of normal business, the Senate
chamber is mostly empty except for one senator delivering a
monologue. The few senators in their seats often read or sign mail.
Others wander in and out and whisper to their colleagues and their
aides.
</P>
<P>
   All will be different during the impeachment trial. Senate
leaders Wednesday handed out ``Decorum Guidelines for Senate
Trial.'' Among the pointers were these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Senators should plan to be in attendance throughout the trial.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reading should be limited to material pertaining to the trial.
</P>
<P>
   _ During votes, senators should stand at their seats and call
out ``yea'' or ``nay.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The well of the Senate, where tables have been set up for the
House managers and President Clinton's defense team, will be off
limits.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most difficult: ``We should also refrain from
speaking to neighboring senators while the case is being
presented.''

N.Y. COLUMN: MYSTIQUE OF A BUTTERFLY STIRS THE SOUL OF A TOWN
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILTON, N.Y. _ It is tiny and dainty and flits by so quickly
that many residents here have never actually spied the Karner blue
butterfly. But no matter. Who can resist the idea of saving a
butterfly, particularly if doing so can also save a town's soul?
</P>
<P>
   Wilton, in the Adirondack foothills just north of Saratoga
Springs, was hardscrabble back country in the early 1960s,
distinguished only by the mountaintop cabin in which Ulysses S.
Grant died. It had fewer than 400 residents. But then Interstate 87
_ the Northway, as it is known here _ roared through. And in what
seemed like the flutter of a butterfly's wings, Wilton turned into
a tract-house bedroom community of 15,000 for Albany's workers, a
distribution hub for companies like Ace Hardware, and the site of a
mall.
</P>
<P>
   Roy McDonald, the Republican town supervisor and a longtime
proponent of development, realized a few years ago that it was
Wilton's rural character that drew him here and that he ought to
work on salvaging what remained. His idea was to create a nature
preserve, but he knew that buying land for such a project can be
tough on taxpayers and fatal for a politician.
</P>
<P>
   Then he learned that the area he wanted to preserve happened to
be one of the largest habitats east of the Mississippi for the
imperiled Karner blue. So the Karner blue, officially declared an
endangered species in 1992, has become the banner that is stirring
local hearts and serving to pry open government and private
coffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was no butterfly we'd be doing this anyway, but the
butterfly gives us the mystique,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   The Karner blue, with characteristic iridescent blue wings, was
named after a now-vanished nearby hamlet by Vladimir Nabokov, a
lepidopterist as well as the author of ``Lolita.'' Like
11-year-olds who will dine only on chicken nuggets and plain pasta,
the Karner blue is a picky eater. Its caterpillar savors only the
leaf of the wild blue lupine, a wildflower with violet-blue
blossoms that thrives in sunny meadows. The adult female, which has
all of a one-inch wingspan, lays its eggs on the blue lupine's
leaves before it dies.
</P>
<P>
   Blue lupine, though, is being gobbled up by suburban sprawl and
so the Karner blue's populations have been dwindling, disappearing
entirely in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Lynn LaMontagne, a regional manager of the
Nature Conservancy, noticed that a one-acre parcel of Karner blue
habitat was being sold for back taxes. She asked McDonald if the
town would buy the property and let her organization manage it. She
didn't realize how modest her sights were.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about 2 to 3,000 acres?'' is what McDonald remembers
telling her before he laid out his dream for a wildlife preserve
that could at the same time protect the butterfly habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, butterflies have been symbols of freedom,
romance, and whimsy, and the notion of saving a butterfly, as
opposed to some esoteric snake or rodent, seems to have enchanted
and galvanized Wilton residents.
</P>
<P>
   Violet Opdahl donated 45 acres of farmland that her family had
owned since 1930, a tax write-off she had been planning anyway but
that now had a noble rationale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent our childhood in those fields and woods,'' the
74-year-old Ms. Opdahl said. ``I was concerned if I sold it would
end up in the hands of developers and I didn't want that.''
</P>
<P>
   Businessmen rallied around the bug. The Marriott family, which
manufactures portable toilets, and Marcel Zucchino, president of an
instruments manufacturer, pledged that they would not expand their
businesses into blue lupine habitat. Ace Hardware donated shovels
and chain saws for conservation workers.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers passed out blue lupine seeds for children to grow in
their backyards. Property owners promised to mow their land to keep
it as meadow rather then letting it turn to woodland.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. LaMontagne, who is executive director of what has become the
Wilton Wildlife Preserve and Park, estimates that $1.4 million has
come in from New York state, the conservancy and private donors for
land purchases. Five hundred acres have already been acquired; an
additional 615 acres are under negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, a hard-nosed investment banker, does not seem to be a
pushover for ethereal creatures like butterflies. He even
calculates that his campaign for the butterfly might get
Republicans some credit with environmentally conscious voters. But
he is grateful to the fragile Karner blue for helping him build a
park for his hometown's pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't have the butterfly,'' he said, ``I would have to
invent something like it.''

   WASHINGTON _ In their trial briefs, the president's defense team
and the House prosecutors present their Senate jury with a legal
version of ``Rashomon,'' in which the main characters recall the
same events differently.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers, who submitted their brief on Monday, weave
an elaborate narrative in which the president is a corrupt
protagonist, orchestrating a scheme to hide evidence of an illicit
relationship from the lawyers for Paula Jones. In their version of
Clinton's actions, the president is a conspirator who influences
Monica Lewinsky to falsely deny their affair in a sworn affidavit.
He then uses his loyal secretary to conceal gifts he and Ms.
Lewinsky exchanged and to cover up their relationship, and he
attempts to find the former intern a job to insure her silence in
the Jones case. Finally, he lies about it all before a federal
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``When viewed as a unified whole,'' the brief of the House
managers concludes, the evidence ``overwhlemingly supports'' two
articles of impeachment against President Clinton for perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The 130-page trial memorandum submitted on Wednesday by the
president's lawyers paints an altogether different picture of the
same events. The defense brief portrays a president beset by his
enemies, threatened by a politically motivated civil lawsuit and an
independent counsel bent on finding wrongdoing by the president
after years of fruitlessly investigating the Whitewater real estate
deal in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Far from committing perjury or obstructing justice, the
president's lawyers argue, he was simply attempting to conceal an
illicit affair and hide his own embarrassing behavior from his
family and closest aides. When he appeared before a federal grand
jury, however, the president told the truth, the lawyers say,
admitting to an ``inappropriate, intimate'' relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The briefs differ markedly in style as well as substance. What
is most striking about the House brief is its almost novelistic
structure, which lays out a highly detailed story alleging perjury
and obstruction of justice with chronological chapters and
subheadings such as ``Ms. Lewinsky's First Visit'' and ``Need For
The Cover Story.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's brief is filled with legal citations and
arguments that the charges against Clinton do not rise to the level
of impeachable offenses. ``The articles of impeachment that have
been exhibited to the Senate fall far short of what the Founding
Fathers had in mind when they placed in the hands of Congress the
power to impeach and remove a president from office,'' his lawyers
argue. But their brief too has some provocative subchapters,
including a section titled ``The Whitewater Investigative
Dead-End'' that contends the independent counsel's investigation of
Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky was ``wholly unrelated'' to its original
mandate.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the two briefs are indicators of two very
different trial strategies. The House managers want a longer trial
with the testimony of witnesses. Proving that the facts square with
the emphatic accusations in their brief, which in places goes
beyond even the impeachment referral of the independent counsel
Kenneth Starr, would almost certainly require the testimony of
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Although the defense brief disputes the facts in the Starr
referral, it trivializes the actual charges against the president,
minimizes the seriousness of the evidence against him and
criticizes the very structure of the impeachment articles,
whichunconstitutionally contain multiple offenses, the brief
contends. If they were counts in an indictment ``would not survive
a motion to dismiss,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers want a short trial with no witnesses,
and they want it decided on the basis that the case against Clinton
is not serious enough to warrant his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   The House brief, to a far lesser extent than the president's,
does not split the case into two parts, dividing it by the separate
perjury and obstruction charges. The House brief argues that it is
necessary to view the case as a whole and not by pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential to avoid considering each event in
isolation,'' the House managers maintain. ``Events and words that
may seem innocent or even exculpatory in a vacuum may well take on
a sinister, or even a criminal, connotation when observed in the
context of the whole plot.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's brief, by contrast, dissects each article, piece
by piece. On perjury, the president's lawyers argue that the House
case rests on ``such insignificant matters as misremembering the
precise months on which certain inappropriate physical contact
started'' and ``understanding as `occasional' his infrequent
inappropriate physical and telephone contacts with Ms. Lewinsky
over a period of many months.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his grand jury testimony, the president's prepared statement
said his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky spanned 1996 and 1997,
while she said it began in late 1995. She described 11 sexual
encounters with the president and 17 telephone conversations that
involved sexual banter.
</P>
<P>
   Because the president admitted to an ongoing physical
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in his grand jury statement, the
president's lawyers dismiss discrepancies between his testimony and
Ms. Lewinsky's over the number and dates of their encounters,
saying that ``these squabbles are utterly immaterial.''
</P>
<P>
   As to clashes in their testimony over the nature of their sexual
contact, the president's lawyers repeat their prior insistence that
President Clinton believed oral sex did not fall within the
definition of sexual relations in the Jones case and that other
intimiate touching alleged by Ms. Lewinsky ``comes down to an oath
against an oath.''
</P>
<P>
   This he-said-she-said argument of course, could undermine Ms.
Lewinsky's credibility when it comes to the second article of
impeachment, for obstruction of justice. Here the president's brief
relies on Ms. Lewinsky's testimony that no one ever told her to lie
and that she was never promised a job for her silence. The House
managers' brief argues that no one would have been so explicit in
seeking her cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The House brief also argues that the president's conversations
with Ms. Lewinsky about her affidavit in the Jones case and efforts
to find her a job after she appeared on the Jones witness list
strongly suggest an unlawful scheme to shape her testimony. The
president's lawyers counter that efforts to help Ms. Lewinsky find
employment began long before she became embroiled in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers also charge that the President's misleading
testimony in the Jones case constitutes obstruction of justice, a
contention that goes beyond the Starr referral and the articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The briefs also clash sharply on the proper standards and
precedents for the impeachment of federal officeholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate's own precedents establish beyond doubt that
perjury warrants conviction and removal,'' the House managers
maintain, pointing out that the 1980s the Senate convicted and
removed three federal judges for committing perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The president's brief cites other precedents, stressing that the
articles of impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee
against President Richard M. Nixon alleged officials wrongdoing and
that an article involving private and the filing of a fraudulent
tax return was rejected. The brief also reaches back to 1792, when
Congress investigated Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton for
making payments to a swindler whose wife was Hamilton's paramour, a
private matter that was deemed unworthy of removing Hamilton from
office.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers, however, soundly reject the notion that the
president's dealings with Ms. Lewinsky and his testimony about it
are a private matter. ``This case is not about sex or private
conduct,'' their brief states. ``It is about multiple obstructions
of justice, perjury, false and misleading statements, and witness
tampering _ all committed or orchestrated by the president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, despite the more than 50 pages of detailed narrative in
the House managers brief, the president's lawyers argue that the
charges against him are unfairly vague.

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
LAS VEGAS _ One moment, he's the ``new'' Mike Tyson, feeding on
continued psychotherapy to gain a pleasant attitude that sometimes
yields friendly joke sessions with members of the media.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next, he's an expletive-spewing, angry throwback to the
hostile man who became the youngest-ever world heavyweight champion
and a master intimidator in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Jekyll and Hyde live in this 5-foot-11, chiseled body of energy
whom doctors have deemed mentally stable enough to re-enter the
ring without coming unhinged as he did when he bit Evander
Holyfield's ears in 1997, earning the suspension of his boxing
license.
</P>
<P>
   To many of those who surround Tyson on a regular basis, he's a
man struggling to come to grips with life and gives every
indication the battle will soon be won.
</P>
<P>
   But his actions of the past few days seem to indicate he may not
have made quite the significant progress his handlers have
advertised.
</P>
<P>
   The latest indications occurred during a 48-hour period that
culminated Wednesday at the final formal news conference before
Tyson meets Francois Botha on Saturday night at the MGM Grand
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The former undisputed world heavyweight champion was asked
Wednesday if he was still a hungry fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to answer that, but they put a muzzle on me,'' Tyson
said. ``I can't say what I really want to say. There was an
incident on TV with a gentleman from New York.''
</P>
<P>
   That took place Tuesday when Tyson engaged in a conference call
with members of the electronic media. One broadcaster based in New
York asked Tyson if he felt capable of controlling his rage.
</P>
<P>
   Expletives flowed from Tyson's mouth. When asked why the
profanity was necessary, he let go with another blue cascade more
forceful than the first.
</P>
<P>
   The new Mike Tyson? The product of regular psychotherapy since
mid-October who's supposed to be more at peace with himself and his
surroundings?
</P>
<P>
   Dan Goossen is president of America Presents, the promotions
group that signed Tyson to a contract last summer after he bolted
from Don King. Goossen thinks Tyson is indeed on track to
respectability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I want to say `changed' as much as say it
looks like he's enjoying himself quite a bit with the public, with
the media,'' Goossen said. ``Quite frankly, he just seems to be
exuding a very nice nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there are those moments. But see Tyson during a public
workout as he prepares for Saturday's 10-round comeback bout, and
there seems to be a quirkiness about him still.
</P>
<P>
   The characteristic black boots sans socks are evident. But in
place of the ubiquitous black boxer's trunks is fluorescent
lime-green underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to some of his chatter for more evidence that Tyson may
not yet be out of the woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I lost to Holyfield. I bit his ears,'' he said. ``He's a
good fighter, but he's not Mike Tyson. He and Lennox Lewis are
going to fight, and they can't sell out the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I fight on the same night as these guys, they're out of a
job. I'm making $35 million fighting a 10-rounder this weekend. I'm
the champion even when I'm not the champ. I'm the king. Muhammad
Ali set the stage, but there's never been a fighter as big as Mike
Tyson.''
</P>
<P>
   A man in transition? A man gaining a firmer foothold in
mainstream society? One putting the beasts of a troubled past to
rest, once and for all?
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, part of the reason Tyson remains the top draw in a
sport drastically in need of an image cleansing is his sordid
life's tale. It has made him a tiger in the ring, a spectacle, a
curiosity to a public thirsty for those qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still incredibly exciting, and you never know what's
going to happen,'' said veteran promoter Don Elbaum. ``When you
watch Tyson, you're seeing an animal. That's something you're not
going to get with a Roy Jones or Lennox Lewis.''
</P>
<P>
   Something you also won't get from Jones or Lewis is
inattentiveness and boredom during pre-fight news conferences, the
typical behavior of Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last two months as America Presents conducted news
conferences around the country to hype Saturday's pay-per-view
card, he was a model citizen.
</P>
<P>
   During the first one, held in Hollywood, he was light-hearted
and exchanged jokes with the media. He was airy, free-spirited, a
pleasure to be around.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a worldwide teleconference two weeks ago. Near the end
of the 30-minute conversation, Tyson was asked about having once
described himself as a kindred spirit to the late, troubled
heavyweight champion Sonny Liston.
</P>
<P>
   It sparked an expletive-spiced, rambling diatribe that probably
made sense to no one but Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing fans traditionally care about more than the fight. They
care about the conflict behind the conflict,'' said Jay Larkin,
executive producer of Showtime Championship Boxing. ``And in terms
of drama, few can compare to Tyson. Tyson the story has eclipsed
Tyson the boxer.''
</P>
<P>
   Goossen had only casually known Tyson before last summer.
</P>
<P>
   He has been amazed at Tyson's demeanor away from the glare of
the spotlight and appreciative of the gracious, cooperative nature
the fighter has exhibitied while ``doing everything we've asked of
him over the past six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran trainer Lou Duva has known Tyson most of his
professional career. He, too, has noted a change in Tyson since
October, when, on the advice of mental health specialists, the
Nevada State Athletic Commission by a vote of 4-1 reinstated
Tyson's boxing license.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only talked to him a couple of times,'' said Duva. ``And
it seems to me he's a little passive. It's like he's saying, `These
people want me to show them what's what.' I know I've seen him blow
his top once.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the metamorphosis of Iron Mike Tyson continues. Duva
feels a truer picture of the emerging man may be revealed after
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much significance on this fight,'' Duva said,
``mentally and physically. This determines which way Mike Tyson is
going to go.''

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
CHICAGO _ The show must go on.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's pretty much the message NBA commissioner David Stern was
giving everyone Wednesday at the news conference to announce
Michael Jordan's retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan may be gone, but the NBA is here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very strong league, made more so by having Michael
Jordan a part of it,'' Stern said. ``I won't get into the argument
about predictions, but I'll only say, `See us in six months, and
tell me what kind of season we've had.' I think you're going to be
very pleasantly surprised about the strength of the league, the
competitiveness and the depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, but it was Jordan who propelled the league to the
stratospheric heights it enjoyed before the recent six-month
lockout began to erode that popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, however, thinks the league will prosper anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the league is going to continue on, although we've had
our troubles over the last six months,'' he said. ``I think that
(the lockout) was a reality check for all of us. It is a business,
but yet it's still fun, it's still a game, and the game will
continue on.''
</P>
<P>
   Having Jordan stick around for one more season would have
greatly helped the healing process.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Stern was able to package Jordan's
made-for-highlights game _ the soaring dunks, the
degree-of-difficulty drives through the lane, the no-look passes _
for worldwide consumption. And the world eagerly lapped up every
image, word and souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Jordan's retirement) will leave a huge vacuum for the
league,'' said New Jersey's Jayson Williams. ``It's going to be
very, very hard to replace him.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding a way to do just that will be a daunting task, but Stern
is confident it can be done. After all, he pointed out, the league
found a way to go on after Wilt Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson and
Jerry West departed and after Julius Erving, Larry Bird and Magic
Johnson retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Michael's void will be filled is by a group of
players,'' Stern said. ``I don't want to shortchange any particular
player by listing a whole group and leaving someone out, but when
one looks at (Boston's) Antoine Walker, (Philadelphia's) Allen
Iverson, (Seattle's) Vin Baker, (New Jersey's) Keith Van Horn, (the
Lakers') Shaq (O'Neal), (Detroit's) Grant Hill, (Orlando's) Penny
(Hardaway) or (the Lakers') Kobe (Bryant), you're going to see an
extraordinary number of stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you take something good from this, and I'm trying, the
fact of the matter is that the light that has shone so brightly on
Michael _ sometimes to the exclusion of others because of his
exploits and the way he carried himself _ will be spread amongst a
much greater number of players. America is going to get to meet
some people that they've never met before.
</P>
<P>
   ``But none of them is going to replace Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who did his share to carry the league throughout his
Hall of Fame career with the Lakers, thinks the era of the
transcendent superstar might have ended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think one person can carry the baton and lead the
league. It'll have to be the teams,'' said Johnson, now part-owner
of the Lakers. ``The Lakers have to become the team they are
supposed to be. Indiana and New York are going to have to come up.
Just like when the Lakers dominated and the Celtics dominated, we
have to turn to somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   And turn to somebody else when it comes to role models as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (Jordan, Johnson and Bird) have to continue to be the good
guys until the young guys break through,'' Johnson said. ``Maybe it
will be Kobe Bryant or Shaquille O'Neal or Grant Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley said he will wait to see which player elevates
himself to that level, rather than having the league simply choose
a player to be celebrated _ as it tried to do with Bryant last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't pass the torch,'' Barkley said. ``You earn the
torch. Nobody gave Dr. J (Erving) the torch; he earned it. Nobody
gave Magic and Bird the torch. Nobody gave Michael the torch. He
earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some old-timers doubt the new breed has what it takes to replace
the complete package Jordan presented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael's had the greatest impact on the NBA (of) any player
in history,'' said Dolph Schayes, one of the NBA's 50 Greatest
Players. ``He was the greatest competitor who came through when
asked. He'll surely be missed the first year or two out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sold out buildings because people want to see him. He got a
lot of people who were not fans watching the game. There's nobody
on the horizon to take his place, not Grant Hill and not Kobe
Bryant. He's the player of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one area where Jordan's absence may be seen as
beneficial _ for once, the NBA season will begin without a
clear-cut favorite to win the championship. Teams such as the
Pacers, Lakers, Heat and Knicks are entertaining title thoughts.
And if the Rockets can make the right moves, they will be in the
hunt as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of players who are telling me they are going to
win,'' Stern said. ``Mr. (Stephon) Marbury and Mr. (Kevin) Garnett
are telling me it's going to be Minnesota, but Shaq and Kobe are
telling me it's going to be LA. Reggie (Miller) and the Pacers are
saying they have something else in mind. David Robinson and Tim
Duncan (of San Antonio) have their own views, Patrick (Ewing) and
the Knicks think they can do it, and Alonzo (Mourning) and the Heat
think they can do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go on and on. There are eight to 10 teams that are
waiting to start their official training camp next week who think
they are going to be the next champions of the NBA. That, to me, is
the sign of a very strong league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person who will follow Michael is the person whose team
wins. This is an unforgiving business _ you have to win. Let's see
who wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever that may be, it likely won't be at the Bulls' expense,
since Chicago fell from the ranks of championship contenders the
moment Jordan announced his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   And Jordan was quick to remind Barkley, Ewing and Utah's Karl
Malone of that very point.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all wanted me to come back just so if they win a
championship, they can say they've gone through Chicago and Michael
Jordan to win it to give it the meaning of taking the title away
from Chicago,'' Jordan said, laughing. ``And that's the good thing
about it (retiring) _ that they won't ever have the chance to say
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I was so glad that Magic played and Bird played
when I won my titles, because I had to go through, to some degree,
Boston and LA. Patrick, I don't know, he won't be able to live with
himself _ he can't beat Michael Jordan in a series. Charles
Barkley, I told him he would never win because he doesn't dedicate
himself to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them joked with me and hated to see the possibility of
me retiring just because they didn't have an opportunity to beat me
in the Finals or get past me. That is the cute thing about
retiring. And I will always hold that in high respect when I see
these guys socially.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
CHICAGO _ When Michael Jordan announced Wednesday that he was
retiring from the game he has ruled for so long, it might have been
the wrecking ball that began the razing of the Chicago Bulls'
dynasty.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indeed, after shooting down so many other teams' title hopes
over the years, Jordan shot down the Bulls with his announcement.
</P>
<P>
   It was no secret Chicago management was frantically trying to
squeeze out one last title, hoping to entice Jordan, Scottie
Pippen, Dennis Rodman and perhaps even exiled coach Phil Jackson
back for one last go-round.
</P>
<P>
   But when Jordan uttered the words, ``I am here to announce my
retirement from the game of basketball,'' it ended all such talk in
Chicago. Now come the questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will they do now?'' asked Craig Hodges, a former Bull.
``Rebuild, rebuild, rebuild. Brick by brick. That's what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a pleasant thought after six NBA titles in the '90s. Local
fans, accustomed to winning, didn't welcome the news of Jordan's
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only team we have left with any hope of winning anything
is the Cubs,'' said James Block, 28. ``And when the Cubs are the
best team in Chicago, that's pretty sad.''
</P>
<P>
   A new era will soon begin in Chicago, one with Tim Floyd as
coach and Toni Kukoc, Randy Brown, Ron Harper and Keith Booth among
the players. Jordan has retired, and Pippen is a free agent who is
supposedly leaning toward coming to Houston. Rodman, Steve Kerr,
Luc Longley and just about everyone else who had anything to do
with last year's title are free agents as well.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuild or attempt to re-sign? Pippen, Rodman and Kukoc wouldn't
be a bad foundation, but general manager Jerry Krause reportedly
wants to start almost from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys we have back are basically young,'' Krause said of
the Bulls' roster. ``(We would) add more youth to them and see
where we go from there to build another championship team. We did
that once before a number of years ago with youth, stayed with
youth and added veterans as we went along.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Bulls were to struggle this year, they wouldn't be able
to pick a better season. After the six-month lockout, the league
has stripped the campaign to 50 games.
</P>
<P>
   Re-signing Pippen, Longley and perhaps Rodman might benefit
Floyd this season, but it might not be the best thing in the long
run for the Bulls. Using this season to rebuild would put them in
position to get a high draft pick, expediting the rebuilding
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanted to blow off a season, this is the one,'' said
one NBA general manager. ``It's not like being bad from October to
May. This is for three months.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the longest months imaginable now that Jordan is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan addressed the Bulls' murky future during his news
conference at the United Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it presents a challenge for them,'' said Jordan,
uttering one of the greatest understatements in sports history,
``to live up to the standards that we have brought here in the city
of Chicago. And I think it's part of the challenge for Jerry Krause
and (chairman) Jerry Reinsdorf and Tim Floyd to maintain that, and
I think they welcome that challenge, and that's good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what decisions they're going to make in terms of
free agency. I'd like to see them keep Scottie Pippen around and
give him the just due that he's deserving, but that's just my
opinion once again. But we set high standards here, and the
pressure's on them to maintain that. Now, how long will that last?
Will it be next year?''
</P>
<P>
   It could be this year if Krause plays his cards right.
</P>
<P>
   Renouncing their rights to Jordan would put the Bulls
significantly under the salary cap and squarely in the Antonio
McDyess sweepstakes. And if Krause, the only executive able to sign
Pippen to a contract worth more than $14 million annually, signs
the free-agent forward and deals him to, say, the Lakers for Eddie
Jones and Elden Campbell, the Bulls suddenly look like a contender
again.
</P>
<P>
   But expect Chicago to go in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry and Tim Floyd have their work cut out for them,'' Hodges
said. ``But they're professionals; they'll figure something out.
You can't feel sorry for him (Floyd). He understands the game, and
he understands what has to be done. I'm sure that just like an
athlete, a coach has to have challenges that need to be met.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't meet those challenges, you're not worth your
salt. He's no different than anyone else. I'm sure he's looking
forward to it.''

TYSON GOOD, NEVER GREAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Some have declared that the Mike Tyson who
annihilated then-unbeaten Michael Spinks in 91 mesmerizing seconds
in 1988 could have beaten any heavyweight in history.
</P>
<P>
   These days, such a contention _ that Tyson at his best
!ital!was!off! the best _ seems ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   Several boxing experts were asked whether Tyson, who returns to
the ring against Francois Botha on Saturday, was ever the greatest
fighter, a fighter who should be mentioned with the likes of Jack
Dempsey or Joe Louis or Muhammad Ali or even Joe Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   Their collective answer? No way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a comet that streaks across the sky,'' said
trainer/television commentator Teddy Atlas, who worked with Tyson
as an amateur. ``Comets are brilliant, they have a lot of power, a
lot of majesty but they don't have enough substance to remain in
the sky like a planet or a star.
</P>
<P>
   ``This analogy can apply to Tyson: He didn't have the character
to remain in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   The experts, along with most boxing observers, acknowledge that
the young Tyson had great tools: astounding speed and power,
intimidating rage and a style _ constant head movement and punches
in bunches _ suited perfectly to his God-given gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the comet was formed.
</P>
<P>
   For almost six years, 1985 to 1990, he destroyed anything that
got in his way to become the sport's most significant phenomenon
since Muhammad Ali changed boxing in the 1960s. Fight fans couldn't
get enough of him and even those who wouldn't know Marvin Hagler
from Marvin Hamlisch were intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   He won his first 37 bouts, including a second-round knockout of
Trevor Berbick to become the youngest world champion _ at 20 _ in
1986. Thirty-three of the victories came by knockout, !ital!17!off!
by first-round knockout.
</P>
<P>
   And with each demolition, his legend grew. It appeared to most
fans that Tyson was utterly unbeatable, and they didn't care about
the lack of suspense. They paid to see their man devour his prey,
and they did it in record numbers: He became the greatest
money-maker in the history of the sport and somehow remains so.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing he brought to the old-time fight fan was this: He
was heavyweight champion as a heavyweight champion should be,''
boxing historian and author Bert Sugar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He dispatched his opponents in one, two rounds. You have to
understand that right before him ... heavyweight championship
fights were going the whole distance. That's not what boxing fans
expect. Tyson brought back Louis and Dempsey in that respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what a heavyweight champion should be. Decisions are
for featherweights or lightweights.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many saw this and anointed Tyson one of its greatest
champions. After all, it's difficult to improve upon invincible.
</P>
<P>
   That's where they went wrong. They forgot to ask themselves one
very important question: Who did he beat?
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is when you ask people, `Who's the best fighter Mike
Tyson ever beat?' they're almost stumped,'' said television analyst
Larry Merchant. ``Who was it? Spinks? (Razor) Ruddock? They can't
come up with an obvious answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best fighters he fought, (Buster) Douglas and (Evander)
Holyfield, beat him. He's dominating when he's faced with opponents
who can be dominated. When he has been faced with someone who can't
be dominated, he has been something less.''
</P>
<P>
   As Atlas said, that's Tyson's great deficiency: When things get
tough, he folds.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Tyson was awesome when his opponents were terrified or
without ability or both. When the other guy in the ring stood up to
him and had sufficient skills, though, he was reduced to a mere
mortal.
</P>
<P>
   So who !ital!was!off! the best fighter he beat?
</P>
<P>
   Spinks? A great but unspectacular light heavyweight. Larry
Holmes? Once an exceptional fighter who was well past his prime.
Tony Tubbs? Tony Tucker? Bonecrusher Smith? Ruddock? Take your
pick; none do much for Tyson's resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to rate a fighter by the fighters he's fought,''
Sugar said. ``He's never fought anyone to validate his
credentials.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss to Douglas _ an unforgettable 10th-round knockout on
Feb 11, 1990 in Tokyo _ was the first and most shocking of Tyson's
in-the-ring failures.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the first clear indication that he might not be as
good as many believed. As Merchant pointed out, no truly great
fighter lost to an opponent as marginal as Douglas in his prime.
Certainly not Louis or Ali.
</P>
<P>
   However, Tyson's most telling defeats came at the hands of
Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's mystique appeared to be shattered by Douglas. That was
nothing three-plus years in prison for rape and subsequent
victories over four unworthy opponents couldn't reverse in the eyes
of many of his followers.
</P>
<P>
   The reason he lost to Douglas? He had lost focus.
</P>
<P>
   When Tyson stepped into the MGM Grand ring to face Holyfield on
Nov. 9, 1996, he brought with him his aura of invincibility.
Holyfield, deemed washed up by almost everyone, seemed to be
another victim in waiting.
</P>
<P>
   And then he wasn't. Holyfield, fearless and far from over the
hill, gave Tyson a terrible beating before the bout was stopped in
the 11th round.
</P>
<P>
   And when they did it again the following June, Tyson hit bottom
in his career. Apparently on his way to another loss, he twice bit
Holyfield's ears and was disqualified in the third round. He
subsequently lost his license for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe that fight defined the true Tyson, the Tyson who
will face Botha in the same MGM Grand ring in which he twice met
Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Botha doesn't appear to have the ability to fend off the former
champion. Even today, even with the three humiliating losses and
the erosion of both his skills and mystique, Tyson can still take
all but a few heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he remains a very good fighter _ good, not great, as it
always was.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a sensational style that is naturally crowd-pleasing,''
Merchant said. ``And he had the lifestyle to support it. That's why
he became such a compelling figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think an argument can be made, though, that he's one of
those great, power-hitting Triple-A first baseman who hits 40 home
runs at Albuquerque. But when he's faced with the best major-league
pitching, he turns out to be much less than that.''

   LOS ANGELES: what we needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Menzi likes to think of himself as a man with simple
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Simi Valley auto repair shop owner spends his
days fixing transmissions and changing timing belts. He's doesn't
like a lot of attention but rather enjoys the quiet life.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the Northridge temblor, however, Menzi's
survival became a defining story of the quake's wrath and the will
to live. Day after day, newspapers and TV featured the image of his
charred pickup truck surrounded by 70-foot flames from a broken gas
main and torrents of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attention I've got since then is tiring, but I survived
the Big One and I met a lot of good people,'' Menzi said. ``I don't
even remember much about what happened or how I felt that day, so
it's funny to me that I was so big in the media.''
</P>
<P>
   When the quake hit, Menzi was at his Simi Valley home. His first
reaction was to jump into his truck and drive to Canyon Country in
the Santa Clarita Valley north of Los Angeles to check on his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   As he drove along Balboa Boulevard in the San Fernando Valley
community of Granada Hills, about 25 miles northwest of downtown
Los Angeles, his pickup stalled. When he tried to restart it, a
natural gas leak ignited, setting him afire and killing his two
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   He escaped the burning truck and, despite the second-degree
burns over 30 percent of his body, a stunned Menzi walked and
hitchhiked six miles to his mother's house.
</P>
<P>
   Many thought Menzi had perished in the explosion until details
of his amazing story began to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Menzi is left with a few small scars on his back and a
slight fear of fire. It doesn't get in the way of his life, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have more respect for fire now,'' he said. ``The power of
fire has really hit home.''
</P>
<P>
   The toughest aspect of the quake for him was losing his two
dogs. But they've been replaced by two new ones, Bear and Jude.
</P>
<P>
   The quake changed Menzi's life in one way, he said. The
importance of friends and family has grown during the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep more in contact with friends now, it's become more
important to me,'' Menzi said. ``I should have eaten it in that
quake, and when you think about that it makes you value life
more.''

FOR SOME, '94 QUAKE HELPED FORGE PERSONAL STRENGTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- After the Northridge Earthquake tossed an armoire
onto Susie Riley and broke her neck, doctors could only stare at
the ground and dodge questions when she asked whether she would
walk again.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many victims of the temblor Jan. 17, 1994, the Valencia,
Calif., woman spent months fighting to reclaim her life. And like
many, her story is one of redemption and resilience.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after the quake, Riley has achieved what doctors
hesitated to predict -- she can walk again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to give up. I watched too many people in the
hospital give up and just not walk again,'' Riley said. ``What was
the worst year of my life actually made me a stronger person.''
</P>
<P>
   Although just about every Los Angeles resident experienced the
fear and hardship of America's costliest earthquake disaster, some,
like Riley, carry with them stories that will last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   They include Jimmy Menzi, a Simi Valley, Calif., mechanic whose
incinerated pickup truck became one of the most emblematic
televised images of the quake.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Mike and Patricia Kubeisy, who found love amid
the deadly collapse of the Northridge Meadows apartment building in
suburban Northridge in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles.
They got married and now have two children.
</P>
<P>
   As the fifth anniversary of the Northridge Quake approaches,
Riley is reflecting upon her miraculous recovery and the lessons
she and her family learned.
</P>
<P>
   `We've learned not to take life for granted, and to open our
eyes and slow down to enjoy life. It can all be taken away from you
in an instant,'' she said, rubbing her weakened right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Riley spent the first six hours after the earthquake wrapped in
a blanket in a hospital parking lot -- lying in the bed of her
husband's pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   She couldn't move any of her limbs. It took four months in two
hospitals before she could stand on her own. All the while, doctors
weren't encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one morning I woke up and I could move the toes on
my right foot. I was so excited I told the doctor and he stared at
me and just said, Interesting,'' Riley said. ``I guess you could
say I was in denial of my condition. I was going to walk again.
That was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her hospital stay was laced with a bit of irony. Years before
actor Christopher Reeve fell from a horse and was paralyzed, he
visited the suburban Van Nuys hospital where Riley was undergoing
treatment; he was preparing for a role as a quadriplegic police
detective in the film ``Above Suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeve spent hours with her, watching how she propped herself
upright holding bars and how she maneuvered in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   She often glances at Page 241 of Reeve's book, ``Still Me,''
where he mentions his encounter with Riley before he became
paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still shocks me that this happened to him. I feel like I
should return the favor and visit him -- give him encouragement,''
Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   She remains optimistic that she will continue to regain
movement. She's got her husband, Steve, 45, and her teen-age
children for motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the emotional and spiritual lessons learned, the Rileys
have made some practical changes: They've bolted their furniture to
the walls. And each day, she marvels at accomplishments that most
take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can eat and brush my teeth and turn on the television by
myself now,'' she said. ``I didn't even consider this before it was
all taken from me in an instant.'
</P>
<P>
   Tricia Silden didn't know Mike Kubeisy until 1994 when he pulled
her off a balcony from the destroyed Northridge Meadows apartment
complex. Now she knows him as a hero, and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Silden's rescue and Kubeisy's heroic efforts to save dozens of
other residents have earned him five years of media attention,
including spots on ``Nightline'' with Ted Koppel.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton even sought him out in the days after the
earthquake to shake his hand.
</P>
<P>
   But you could throw away all of the attention as far as Kubeisy
is concerned. What's more important is that he married Silden one
year after the deadly quake.
</P>
<P>
   What was once the worst time of his life gave birth to his
eternal happiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for the quake, I would have never met the woman
of my dreams,'' said Kubeisy, now 40. ``I believe God used me for a
purpose that morning, to help people, and in that I was led to my
perfect wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, the Kubeisys have a full house in Simi Valley.
Their second son was born in August of last year. Kubeisy's career
as a still photographer on movie sets is also going strong.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship began amid the rubble and death of the
Northridge Meadows collapse, when Kubeisy rigged a chain ladder to
the balcony of apartment 346, where Silden had been trapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were moans of death everywhere and the sky was on fire
from (Menzi's) accident. It was surreal,'' Kubeisy said. ``Tricia
and I became good friends after that and we got married. My life
has really come full circle since that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tricia is nothing short of amazing and I love being a dad,''
he said. ``I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubeisy is proud that he was able to help his neighbors, and
said he loves the media attention, but he doesn't like being called
a hero. The image of bloody water flowing down a drainage channel
behind the complex still haunts him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pierces my heart to be called a hero. To be tagged that at
the expense of death -- forget it,'' Kubeisy said. ``Me and others
were just doing what we needed to do.''
</P>

N.Y. COLUMN: JETS FEVER CAN GET LOST IN THE CROWD
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No matter how the Jets or the Broncos play in
Sunday's football game, one prediction can be made with confidence:
the final score will matter a lot less in New York than in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   New York is routinely called a great sports town, and many of
the fans, especially natives like Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, think
that sports are essential to the city's image. But plenty of other
cities have good teams and rabid fans. What distinguishes New York
is the relative unimportance of sports here.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets fever inspired by the American Football Conference
championship game Sunday is a mild version of the affliction that
grips other cities throughout the season.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, a Broncos game has about the same impact on business
at Borders Books &AMP; Music as a blizzard does. But at the Borders
store at 57th Street and Park Avenue, the customers show up no
matter who's playing on Sunday. ``Football doesn't really affect us
one way or the other,'' said Scott Stubbs, the store manager.
</P>
<P>
   The television ratings for last weekend's playoff games clearly
show the difference between New York and other cities with playoff
teams. In the Denver area, 49 percent of households watched the
Broncos' game, according to Nielsen Media Research. In
Jacksonville, 44 percent watched their team play the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York area, though, only 24 percent bothered to watch
the Jets in the playoffs. The rating for the Jets-Jacksonville game
was actually higher in Denver than in New York. The ratings also
were higher even in some places, like Pittsburgh, that didn't have
teams in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   New York's signature sports franchise, the Yankees, had one of
the greatest seasons in baseball history, but they drew fewer fans
than did the teams in seven other cities with smaller populations.
During the first game of the World Series, 41 percent of San
Diego's households followed their team on television, but only 28
percent of New York's watched theirs.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious reason for New Yorkers' apathy is that so many of
them grew up with different teams and different sports. More than
half the population was born outside the city _ 1 million in other
parts of America, 2.5 million in foreign countries. Another reason
is that New Yorkers have so many choices in sports teams and
cultural events. The Jets will be competing Sunday afternoon with
matinees on Broadway and Placido Domingo at the Met.
</P>
<P>
   But the main reason is probably New York's ego. Green Bay is
known as the home of the Packers, and Chicago is most famous
internationally for Michael Jordan, but New York's image doesn't
depend on sports. It's more like Paris or London _ and who can name
their teams?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to leave New York to appreciate how much psychic
energy cities invest in the teams,'' said Craig Unger, the editor
of Boston Magazine. ``Now that so many local industries and
institutions are being absorbed by out-of-town corporations, sports
are becoming the last way for cities to have an identity on the
national stage. That's why Bostonians worry that the Patriots'
leaving will hurt our chances to be a world-class city.''
</P>
<P>
   New York is different, as Unger discovered during his 16 years
living here. ``I was the only person I knew in Manhattan who
watched football on Sundays,'' he said. ``I'd grown up in Dallas,
where the average housewife knew the name of the Cowboys'
third-string linebacker, but in New York I stopped even mentioning
football. It became a guilty, secret pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, if sports don't matter, are New York politicians willing to
lavish so much money on the Yankees and other teams? Call it the
Brooklyn Dodgers Fallacy. Giuliani and other politicians are afraid
of triggering the sort of angst occasioned by the Dodgers' move to
Los Angeles in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   But by then the Dodgers were just about the last vibrant symbol
of Brooklyn's identity as a great independent city. Today's New
York has no such problem. The city's pride has hardly suffered
since the Jets and the Giants moved to New Jersey, and it will
survive no matter where the Yankees end up.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, sending the Yankees across the river might be best for
everyone. Image-conscious New Jerseyans would be proud to get a
famous team, and overtaxed New Yorkers would be freed of a
financial burden. New Yorkers would still be able to follow the
games on television _ although most, of course, would have other
things to do.

RANGERS GET TO .500, BUT HARVEY IS INJURED
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOE LaPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the first two periods of Wednesday night's game
against the Islanders, John MacLean of the Rangers was all over the
score sheet. The problem was, he was in the wrong column, with two
minor penalties and a 10-minute misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should know better,'' said MacLean, a 16-year veteran, ``and
I do.''
</P>
<P>
   MacLean showed that he knows by scoring a goal to tie the score
midway through the third period and assisting on Adam Graves's
game-winner at 3 minutes 8 seconds of overtime in the Rangers' 4-3
victory at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, and the raucous celebration, ended a wild contest,
often sloppy, and filled with penalties and major emotional
moments. It gave the Rangers their second consecutive victory and a
.500 record as they reached the midway point of the 82-game regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   For the Islanders, who competed well with their new goalie Felix
Potvin, it was their fourth consecutive defeat and their eighth
straight game without a victory.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers got bad news _ a left-knee injury to Todd
Harvey, their rambunctious right wing. Harvey suffered a
second-degree sprain of the medial collateral ligament, the Rangers
said, and will probably miss at least four weeks. Barton Nisonson,
the team physician, said: ``It means you have torn some fibers.
It's not a complete tear. Those heal very well.'' He added that
Harvey would not need surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The winning goal gave Graves 19 for the season, the most on the
Rangers. After MacLean passed the puck to Wayne Gretzky, the Great
One slipped a pass to Graves in the slot. It was the second assist
of the night for Gretzky, and it impressed Graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``As wrapped a gift as you're ever going to get,'' Graves said.
``That's why he has records that will never be broken. He makes
plays like that and he makes them at key times. I was worried about
standing in the crease.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the game, an apparent goal by Harvey was nullified
because one of his skates was in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Also playing a major role was Petr Nedved, who gave the Rangers
a 3-2 lead at 12:25 of the third period. It stood up until Kenny
Jonsson of the Islanders tied the score at 3-3 at 17:08 on the
power play.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved, whose availability had been questionable because of a
knee injury, used his linemate Mike Knuble as a decoy, with Knuble
occupying the attention of two defensemen, before beating the
sprawled Potvin with a high wrist shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't 100 percent sure I could play,'' Nedved said of his
injury. ``I was nicely surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Knuble, speaking of Nedved, said: ``It was a gutty performance.
He came through with a huge effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranger Coach John Muckler said Nedved ``won face-offs, he played
a ton.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing at least half a ton was MacLean, who scored at 11:48 of
the third period to tie the score at 2-2. After his helmet was
knocked from his balding head in a tussle with an Islander, MacLean
jumped up, took a pass from Niklas Sundstrom, beat Potvin between
the legs and celebrated jubilantly before looking for his helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only for protection,'' MacLean said.
</P>
<P>
   Muckler said he told MacLean, ``You should play guilty all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his penalty box time, MacLean said he told Muckler,
``I was well rested.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   MacLean, a former Devil who was signed as a free agent last
summer after a brief stay in San Jose, has scored five goals in his
last seven games. With Harvey out, he and Knuble will have more
responsibility on the right flank. Neil Smith, president and
general manager of the Rangers, said the team will draw from their
Hartford farm team and use Derek Armstrong, Scott Fraser and Johan
Whitehall to fill Harvey's role.
</P>
<P>
   Although Muckler has called Harvey the ``heartbeat'' of the
Rangers, it is an irregular beat due to injuries. ``Todd's had four
or five injuries,'' Smith said of a player he traded for last
spring. ``If he's going to play the way he plays, he's going to
have to pick his spots and make sure his condition is ultimate.''
Smith got Harvey in a trade with Dallas when Harvey was injured.
``I'm not saying there is any problem with his conditioning,''
Smith said, ``but he's got to be the fittest of the fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey said his skate got caught in a rut. It appeared that he
hurt the knee while trying to check Jonsson, a skilled defenseman
who was a Ranger target all night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers entered the game with the National Hockey League's
top power play, but could not score a goal despite 10 minutes and
44 seconds with the manpower advantage. The two referees called 20
penalties, many of them overlapping. While praising several
players, Muckler groused about undisciplined moments.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Milbury, coach and general manger of the Islanders,
complained about ``careless turnovers'' by his players and said the
game was ``obviously frustrating.'' He called a timeout after
MacLean's goal, but his team gave up another one, to Nedved, just
37 seconds later. His team had scored on the first shot of the
game, by Lawrence, at the 21-second mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange game,'' Gretzky said. ``It was a huge win for us and a
tough loss for them.'' Discussing his pass to Graves for the
game-winner, Gretzky said: ``I kind of had my head down and saw two
blue guys kind of there and out of the corner of my eye I saw Adam,
got a little bit lucky, threw it over there and Adam put it in the
net.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuelsson, playing in his 1,000th regular-season game, came
close to scoring a second time and also punched the net in
frustration after a slopping clearing pass by a teammate was
intercepted, interrupting a shift change. He called the goal and
milestone game ``sort of special'' and said he might put the puck
on a plaque.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are 3-0 against the Islanders this season. They have
won the last two against last-place teams and they play two more
cellar dwellers this week: the Blackhawks at the Garden on Friday,
the Canadiens in Montreal on Saturday.

SUNY'S CHANCELLOR PLANS TO STEP DOWN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ind.)  (nk) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John W. Ryan, who has been chancellor of the State
University of New York during one of its periods of greatest
change, announced Wednesday that he would leave the post as soon as
a successor was named.
</P>
<P>
   The SUNY board moved quickly to name a search committee of four
trustees, but finding a replacement might be a challenge, although
Ryan said he expected to leave no later than next January.
</P>
<P>
   While the job is prestigious _ chief executive of one the
largest public university systems in America, with 64 campuses and
more than 350,000 students _ it is academically and politically
complex. The SUNY board won a reputation for aggressiveness in
making the university more market-oriented and more accountable to
the board. SUNY must find someone who can live with the board's
hands-on style and its agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``This board has been in the process of asserting itself, and
now it has to stand back if it wants to attract one of the top
leaders in education,'' said Patrick M. Callan, president of the
National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, which is
based in San Jose, Calif. ``I'm not a person who wants to have weak
boards, but this board has to get some clarity about what kind of
leadership it is looking for and make that clear to potential
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though SUNY's trustees have been able to shape their own
agenda, there is much left to do. The next chancellor is likely to
determine how those new policies are put in place and enforced.
</P>
<P>
   The board knows what a difficult search is like since it had
problems finding a qualified candidate before Ryan was chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, who is 69, came to SUNY in 1995 at a difficult time for
the university. Gov. George E. Pataki had appointed a number of new
trustees, creating a sharply divided board that had growing
differences with the chancellor at the time, Thomas A. Bartlett,
who had been appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo shortly before
Pataki's election.
</P>
<P>
   The board pushed Bartlett out but then stumbled in finding even
an interim replacement. One strong candidate for interim chancellor
backed out at the last minute, citing personal reasons. Another was
withdrawn the evening before he was to be voted on, amid growing
questions about his administrative skills. Finally, Ryan, a
respected administrator and former president of Indiana University,
agreed to take the interim job in July 1996, pledging that his
primary goal was to find a strong permanent chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   But that search, too, proved difficult. And in the end, Ryan
reluctantly agreed to stay. He said all along that he did not
expect to stay forever, but his timetable may have been accelerated
by a recent illness.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was not available Wednesday after the announcement because
he was traveling.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, the trustees have made many changes, like
installing a new finance system that rewards campuses that meet
expectations in areas like enrollments, curriculum and
fund-raising. The board also recently adopted a 10-course core
curriculum to be used across the university.
</P>
<P>
   Through all of these changes, Ryan has been a quiet presence, a
chief executive who expressed his views behind the scenes but said
little publicly, letting his provost, Peter D. Salins, do most of
the talking. Faculty members and others who had hoped that Ryan
would offer more vocal opposition to the board and its agenda were
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, chairman of SUNY's board, said that the chancellor had
made ``extraordinary efforts'' for the university and helped it
strengthen the people running SUNY.
</P>
<P>
   ``His greatest contribution derives from her personal stature in
the academic world,'' Egan said Wednesday night. ``He helped us
attract a stronger group of presidents and a top-notch group of
senior administrators.''

A SUBDUED TYSON, LACKING PUNCH AT NEWS CONFERENCE, SAYS HE'S
MUZZLED
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The fizz left the Mike Tyson-Francois Botha
heavyweight fight press conference the moment Steve (Crocodile)
Fitch of Tyson's entourage _ screaming ``Guerilla warfare!'' _ was
led away in handcuffs by two security guards.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Crocodile returned Wednesday, minus the fancy
bracelets, it was too late to light a fire under the dreary affair.
Botha tried. Tyson, whose unpredictability was once his hallmark,
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The promoter, Dan Goosen, needed two introductions to get Tyson
on a theater stage at the MGM Grand. And when Tyson finally
emerged, walking more slowly than a man on his way to the gas
chamber, he didn't have much to say.
</P>
<P>
   This was his opening line: ``My wife has a new line of clothes _
Be Real Tyson Gear _ and I'm here to sponsor it.'' George Foreman's
title as the infomercial heavyweight champion is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Goosen, the MGM Grand and Showtime Event Television are all
banking on Tyson's having more sizzle when he and Botha meet on
Saturday night in a 10-round bout at the MGM Grand Arena. If not,
there won't be much left to sell in the next fight.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Tyson comes off better in a series of cleverly
produced television commercials designed to sell the pay-per-view
event. The promoters of the bout might have fared better running a
string of those commercials Wednesday rather than hold the live
press conference.
</P>
<P>
   A Tyson news conference was once an event, with the volume
turned way up. There would be hundreds of fans clamoring outside
for the former champion. There was no throng Wednesday. And the
volume was low.
</P>
<P>
   From the somber tenor of the news conference here Wednesday, one
would have thought that this Tyson had assembled the news media
here to call it quits. Instead, he was supposed to be heralding his
return to the ring after a 19-month absence resulting from the
revocation of his license for biting both of Evander Holyfield's
ears during a title bout on June 28, 1997. The Nevada State
Athletic Commission lifted Tyson's revocation on Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, 31, explained his solemn mood by saying he had been
muzzled because of a profanity-laced tirade he had gone on during a
satellite television interview with a reporter from a New York
station on Tuesday afternoon. He didn't make clear who applied the
muzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't express what I want to say, because I had an incident
with a gentleman from New York on TV,'' Tyson said. ``But come
Saturday night, you'll get a treat.''
</P>
<P>
   Or get tricked to the tune of $45, the price of the pay-per-view
fight. Goosen said he expects the number of pay-per-view purchases
to go over 1 million. A blackout of Clark County, which includes
Las Vegas, was lifted on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's last bout against Holyfield did a pay-per-view record of
1.9 million buys. The live gate is moving slowly. As of Wednesday,
10,000 tickets had been distributed for the 16,325-seat arena. The
lowest priced seat is going for $200. Ringside is $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Botha, whose 39-1 record includes a 12-round technical knockout
by Michael Moorer, doesn't bring nearly as much to the table as
Holyfield. But Botha is a more credible opponent than Peter
McNeeley, Tyson's first opponent in 1995 after he was freed from
prison after serving three-and-a-half years on a rape conviction.
McNeeley was disqualified when his trainer threw in the towel
shortly after the fight started.
</P>
<P>
   Botha defeated Axel Schulz for the International Boxing
Federation heavyweight title in 1995, but was stripped of the title
after testing positive for steroids following the fight. He is a
heavy underdog to Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings character to the ring,'' Jay Larkin, Showtime's
senior vice president of event programming, said of Botha. ``He's
tough, durable, keeps coming after you and he doesn't cover up.
He's the perfect opponent for the first time coming out. Depending
upon how Mike looks against Botha, it will tell us a lot about his
future.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking a few questions from the media, Tyson punctuated
the press conference by refusing to pose with Botha for the
obligatory face-to-face photographs. He said he would do it after
the fight. And then he left.

CAT BURGLAR PROWLING IN AFFLUENT L.A. HOMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENCINO, Calif. -- A meticulous cat burglar clad in a blue
jogging suit has broken into 38 homes in the affluent Encino Hills
area of Los Angeles, stealing about $500,000 in precious jewelry
and cash since September, police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police call him the Southside Burglar because he hits homes
south of Ventura Boulevard in the city's San Fernando Valley area,
approximately 16 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, said
Detective Jary Quinones of the Los Angeles Police Department's West
Valley Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's smart,'' Quinones said. ``He's crawling through the
windows, bypassing alarms.''
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the burglar picked a lock to break into a house
that its owners had left for just 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Always targeting master bedrooms, he heads straight for armoires
and jewelry boxes, choosing only the most expensive items,
including Rolex watches and gold Cartier necklaces, Quinones said.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to know exactly where to look, rarely ransacks rooms
and leaves behind property that other criminals typically would
take, Quinones said. With each break-in, he gets away with $30,000,
$70,000 or even $100,000 worth of items, the detective said.
</P>
<P>
   Since September, the burglar has worked exclusively in the
Encino Hills area, once home to Clark Gable and now where Michael
Jackson's parents live in a gated estate alongside entertainers,
attorneys and doctors. The average house there sells for about
$750,000, said a real estate agent for Fred Sands.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the burglar chooses his targets by
knocking to see whether anyone is home, usually between 3 and 9
p.m., Quinones said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, police warned about 150 people at a
Neighborhood Watch meeting in Encino to store their valuables in
safe-deposit boxes at banks, rather than at home.
</P>
<P>
   For career burglars, armoires are like candy stores for
children, Quinones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might as well just put up a neon sign with those,'' he
said. ``Most women want their jewelry right there to wear. It's a
burden for some people to go to a bank, but you can get ripped
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Encino Hills resident Les Symons and his wife said they learned
Nov. 13 how quickly the burglar can hit.
</P>
<P>
   The intruder is suspected of stealing about $10,000 in jewelry
from Symons' home as Symons, his wife and their golden retriever
left for only 20 minutes to pick up dinner from Tony Roma's a few
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Symons figured he'd be gone for only a few minutes, so he didn't
activate the alarm. And he took his backup alarm -- his dog -- with
him. Besides, he figured his home was safe, hidden behind hills and
fences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so weird,'' Symons said. ``I can't believe it. I was
extremely unlucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before showering and rushing off to get dinner, Symons'
wife had slipped off the $7,500 engagement ring he gave her a
decade ago and placed it in plain sight on their dresser, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her purse was left on the bed with $60 inside. He didn't even
go through it,'' Symons said.
</P>
<P>
   When they returned, the dog immediately picked up the burglar's
scent and darted down the hallway to the master bedroom, Symons
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought someone was still inside,'' he said. ``I could feel
it by the way she was sniffing.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the burglar is so successful because he
understands how alarms work and knows how to bypass them. He also
dresses in a jogging suit to blend in with residents out for a run.
</P>
<P>
   Quinones urges residents to call police if they see a car or
truck they do not recognize or one whose driver is acting
suspiciously -- even if it turns out to be someone who lives in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be more than willing to apologize to neighbors,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One gardener saw the man flee after a burglary and described him
as a clean-cut Latino or Asian, 24 to 30 years old and weighing
about 180 pounds, Quinones said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Lewis, vice president of the Encino Property Owners
Association, figures the burglar knows the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pattern thing,'' Lewis said. ``He's going into homes
with lots of shrubbery around that can't be seen from the street.
This burglar knows what he's looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kline, who played Larry Davis on the TV series ``Three's
Company'' and lives in the area, said Wednesday that the burglaries
in his neighborhood do not surprise him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can expect crime anywhere,'' he said. ``The
underprivileged get ripped off just as much as the supposed rich
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kline said he tries to reduce the chances of being a target by
knowing his neighbors. At least twice a month, the neighborhood
meets to discuss issues and socialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good idea as an awareness to find out what's going on
on the block,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Their divorces have come through and they have bought
a house in the Hamptons, so the question is: Will WILLIAM BRATTON,
the former police commissioner, propose to RIKKI KLIEMAN, an anchor
on the Court TV cable network?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking for an item, I wish I could give it to
you,'' Ms. Klieman said, ``but I'm still waiting for Bill to pop
the question.'' She added: ``It better be spectacular. I'm waiting
for skywriting or something.''
</P>
<P>
   But the will-you question may be a mere formality. They already
seem to be planning the wedding. At dinner Tuesday at Nirvana, a
restaurant on Central Park South, they invited their friend MICHAEL
GRIFFITH to do card tricks at their reception. ``We were
celebrating the fact that they bought a new house and they won't
have to be house guests at my house anymore,'' said Griffith, a
lawyer and an amateur magician.
</P>
<P>
   If Bratton has a plan for when, where or how he intends to
propose, he is not saying. He did not return a call to his office
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Legal Eagle
</P>
<P>
   On the morning after President Clinton sent $850,000 to Paula
Jones to settle her sexual misconduct lawsuit, her former
spokeswoman was in Manhattan with a prospective client: ABE
HIRSCHFELD, the real-estate developer who last year offered Mrs.
Jones $1 million to drop the charges. ( Hirschfeld later held that
check aloft during a court appearance after he was accused of
hiring a hit man to kill a business partner.)
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the spokeswoman, SUSAN CARPENTER-McMILLAN,
accompanied Hirschfeld to a hearing in Manhattan Criminal Court.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld said she had volunteered to represent him free. ``She
said she felt I was being harassed and it was so unreasonable,'' he
said. He said he was paying only plane fares and hotel rooms for
Ms. Carpenter-McMillan, who would fly in from California for major
court appearances. Ms. Carpenter-McMillan said she was evaluating
the case before deciding whether to sign on.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld also has a new lawyer, RANDY MASTRO, a former deputy
mayor in the Giuliani administration. He would not talk about why
he had taken on Hirschfeld as a client.
</P>
<P>
   Protesting the settlement with Ms. Jones, the New York divorce
lawyer RAOUL LIONEL FELDER canceled his insurance policies with
President Clinton's insurance company, the Chubb Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a pretty good customer for many years,'' said Felder,
adding that he had had policies covering three homes and four cars.
``But nobody else in the world could have an umbrella policy pay
for sexual harassment. It's outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   No Entry
</P>
<P>
   ED KOCH boldly tried to go where he had gone hundreds of times
when he was mayor: to the Blue Room at City Hall. The room where he
presided at press conferences. The room where his portrait no
longer hangs.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer stopped him.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration, which barred demonstrations on the
City Hall steps last summer in a security crackdown, has also
tightened access to the offices inside. But the checkpoint that
Koch did not pass _ a gate with a desk where the officer sits _ is
nothing new. It was there when Koch was mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Koch decided to stop by the Blue Room on the way to a speech by
City Council Speaker PETER VALLONE, and found himself face to face
with the officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to embarrass him,'' Koch said of the guard, whom
he said he recognized from his days in City Hall. ``He's doing
exactly what he was told to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The officer said that he would have to check with Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's press secretary. Koch left for the speech instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public paid for that Blue Room,'' he said. ``It's a jewel,
I'm sure. All of City Hall is a jewel, and you can't get in there
anymore.

DON HEWITT: TOUGH TASKMASTER WITH ONE-TRACK CAREER
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``You're going to hate the beginning,'' Andy Rooney
grumbled Wednesday to his boss, Don Hewitt, who has been the
executive producer of CBS's ``60 Minutes'' forever. Hewitt was in
his office with Rooney and was about to look at a tape of ``A Few
Minutes With Andy Rooney,'' to be broadcast Sunday. It was like
sending your article to a really tough editor.
</P>
<P>
   The tape rolled _ the spot was about Rooney's mail and President
Clinton's impeachment _ then ended. It was funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sensational!'' Hewitt shouted. ``Fantastic! You did it kid,
you did it!''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney beamed. He does not always get such a reaction from
Hewitt. ``He's a pain in the tail to work for, but he's very
good,'' Rooney said. ``When you interview him, you won't get any
idea of how good he is at picking a piece apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it was Hewitt's turn to beam. ``I'm like an idiot savant,''
he said. ``I do this very well. If I were a teller in a bank I'd
probably fail. I have a knack for doing one thing, and it's served
me very well. I don't know, if they never invented television,
maybe I'd still be the head copy boy at The Herald-Tribune.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt is feeling good these days, and a lot younger than his 76
years (``I have an energy level that I don't understand''). One
reason is the debut Wednesday night of ``60 Minutes II,'' the
offspring that Hewitt fought for months as a dilution of the
original but has now come to view as a favorite son. ``It's pretty
damn good,'' he said. Jeff Fager, a trusted ``60 Minutes'' veteran,
is the executive producer. Dan Rather is star correspondent.
Hewitt's connection to the show?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of Daddy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it's a complicated family. Daddy, creator of the most
powerful newsmagazine in the business, is a little competitive.
Hewitt wants the son to do well, but not TOO well. Without doubt,
120 Minutes will compete for stories. ``We're not going to roll
over and play dead for anybody,'' Hewitt said, ``not even our kid
brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Big brother, father _ what Hewitt really is to the television
newsmagazine business is the Grand Old Man, the spawner _ as much
as he disapproves of them _ of the proliferating ``Dateline'' on
NBC and ``20/20'' on ABC. His 50-year-career is nearly as old as
television itself. He grew up in New Rochelle (his father's company
distributed advertising circulars), dropped out of New York
University, then wrote for Stars and Stripes in London during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   But life really began the day in 1948 when he walked into the
old CBS News studios above Grand Central Terminal: ``I felt like
Dorothy in the Emerald City.''
</P>
<P>
   He was there because a friend had called him _ Hewitt was then
writing captions for Acme Newspictures _ to ask if he was
interested in CBS. When Hewitt asked why radio needed a guy with
picture experience, the friend said it was television.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean, where you sit at home and watch little pictures in a
box?'' Hewitt replied, in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt joined CBS as associate director of the 15-minute,
three-night-a-week broadcast ``Douglas Edwards With the News,''
which later grew to five nights (Hewitt had opposed the expansion
on the ground that its quality would be diluted). He became
director of ``See It Now'' with Edward R. Murrow, then executive
producer of ``The CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite,'' the
first half-hour network newscast. (Hewitt opposed that expansion
too, saying its quality would be diluted. A pattern?)
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt also directed and produced the coverage for all three
networks of the first televised presidential debate, between
Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was something wrong,'' he said, ``that the issue of who
was going to be president of the United States revolved around
makeup.'' Hewitt said he asked Kennedy first if he wanted makeup
for the debate, and Kennedy said no. ``He was tan and looked
great,'' Hewitt said. ``And when Nixon heard him say no, he said
no, too.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1968, Hewitt had created ``60 Minutes,'' the first television
newsmagazine, by breaking up the old hourlong documentary into
three separate stories, all packaged, ``like Hollywood packages
fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been 2,700 stories on 900 ``60 Minutes'' since, but
the most famous was in 1992, when presidential candidate Bill
Clinton appeared with his wife to deny an affair with Gennifer
Flowers _ a woman he has since admitted sleeping with.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt said his biggest debacle was caving in to CBS corporate
executives who stopped him from broadcasting a 1995 Mike Wallace
interview with a tobacco-industry whistle-blower. ``Mike and I
could have both resigned,'' Hewitt said. ``But we made the decision
to live to fight another day.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends describe Hewitt as charming, erratic, tempestuous,
prickly, enthusiastic and happily egotistical. He is in good shape,
wears beautiful clothes and hangs them precisely in a commodius
closet. He lives on Central Park West with his wife, Marilyn
Berger, a writer who almost always beats him at Scrabble. He has
two sons, and two daughters from two earlier marriages. He loves to
work, becomes tired on vacations, and is ``devoid'' of all hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they ever force me to retire,'' he said, ``I don't have the
slightest idea what I'd do with myself.''

DAVID NEWTON, 76, OPEN-ADMISSIONS LEADER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas)  (nk) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. David Newton, who shaped the introduction of open
admissions at the City University of New York as chairman of its
Task Force on Open Enrollment in 1969, died on Monday at his home
in Brookville, N.Y. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   He had suffered from serious heart and kidney ailments, his
wife, Laura, said.
</P>
<P>
   Many education officials blend into the woodwork. But Newton was
an outspoken champion of students, someone who arranged
student-faculty picnics and marched in student demonstrations _ a
bearded administrator in solidarity with his bearded students in
the turbulent 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   After CUNY faculty members formed one of the first faculty
unions in the nation, Newton was credited with helping to define
standards for university labor relations. Although he was
considered pro-union and invited faculty labor leaders to his
house, he pressed for contract concessions from faculty and staff
unions and endured faculty strikes to insure that the university
served students the way he thought it should.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, when proponents of open admissions won their sudden
victory to open CUNY to a broader array of students who would
previously not have met its admission standards, the university
turned to Newton, a 47-year-old dean of students at Baruch College,
to lead a task force to answer questions like where to put 15,000
new freshmen and who would teach them.
</P>
<P>
   It was a daunting task. Newton's resulting report spelled out
CUNY's needs, from 1.6 million square feet of additional space to
1,200 more faculty members just for remedial instruction. The panel
also recommended a universitywide testing program in the spring, a
forerunner of the CUNY placement tests now in use.
</P>
<P>
   World War II delayed Newton's route to college. Born in New York
City, the son of Polish immigrants, he served in Merrill's
Marauders, an Army guerrilla unit that infiltrated
Japanese-occupied Burma. After the war, he worked as a cabdriver
and in a factory to support his growing family while he attended
New York University, receiving bachelor's, master's and doctoral
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   His first administrative job was as director of student life at
City College. He moved from there to Baruch, York and then CUNY's
central administration. He left CUNY for Long Island University in
1975 and joined Adelphi University in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   During his battles with cancer and heart problems and the need
for kidney dialysis, he continued to work until last August.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Newton is survived by their children, Manya,
of New York City, and William, of San Antonio; three children from
a previous marriage, Adam, of Austin, Texas, Frederic, of Ross,
Calif., and Scott, of Kazakhstan, and a sister, LeeMarie Bernstein
of Woodbury, N.Y.

`THE WHITE BUFFALO' BATTLES EXTINCTION  
 BOTHA BELIEVES HE CAN SURVIVE TYSON'S FURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ He calls himself The White Buffalo, which in a city
full of impersonators could mean anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   But Frans Botha does not want to be confused with one of
Seigfreid &AMP; Roy's white tigers or any of the other stupid pet
tricks that serve as entertainment along the Vegas Strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White Buffalo is sacred,'' Botha said.
</P>
<P>
   Some would say sacrificial, as if to suggest that Botha will be
a lamb for Mike Tyson to slaughter Saturday night at the MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
   Others might say scared. Run, rabbit, run.
</P>
<P>
   Botha has heard it all.
</P>
<P>
   At least Botha talked the good fight Wednesday as he repeatedly
reminded a skeptical media and a bored Tyson that the only mistake
was to miscast him as a designated opponent without a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here just to survive,'' he said. ``I'm here to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Few give him much hope of that. Botha is a 6-1 underdog at the
MGM sports book and as much as a 12-1 long shot at some other
betting shops.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, the spin has been that Botha in no way
resembles the string of bowling pins that were lined up for Tyson
between his release from prison and Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   But skepticism lingers, in large part because of Tyson's
money-making potential. Botha is Tyson's first opponent in 19
months.
</P>
<P>
   Good business sense would seem to dictate that the promoters
find an opponent who couldn't threaten the money stream that Tyson
always generates.
</P>
<P>
   The search turned up Botha. But there are intriguing questions
because Botha (39-1) is not exactly a known quantity. He spent much
of his career in South Africa and Europe, where he beat Axel Schulz
for the International Boxing Federation title before a positive
test for steroids. He said he took a small dose of steroids for a
shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he's supposed to be slow and lack power. Put the two
together, and Tyson has an opponent who can't hurt him as he stages
predictable assaults in the early rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mind is my greatest asset,'' said Botha, the 30-year-old
son of a South African newspaper-plant manager who moved to the
U.S. about nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Against the increasingly unpredictable Tyson, a sound mind might
be enough to win the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has grown increasingly volatile. A month ago at Phoenix's
Madison Square Garden, Tyson was relaxed and confident as he
trained.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday he appeared to be a guy very near the edge of
the bedlam he created in June 1997, when he bit Holyfield's ears.
He showed up late for the news conference. He cussed. He moodily
dropped his head, face-first, onto a table as though he wanted to
be somewhere, anywhere, else.
</P>
<P>
   Botha couldn't help but notice. If some old cracks are beginning
to reappear under the mounting pressure, all the better for Botha.
</P>
<P>
   Botha made no secret of his plans to test Tyson's poise and
patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be talking to him, for sure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if trash talk is a Botha weapon, it figures to come in the
later rounds. The initial moments probably will test Botha's
ability to withstand an early attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyson is like a wind-up doll,'' Botha said. ``You've got to
wait until he winds down.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than Botha's own cornermen, there's one trainer who is
convinced Botha has the skill to more than just withstand. Tony
Esquer of Michael Carbajal's Ninth Street Gym believes Botha can
win.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Botha trained at Carbajal's gym for his lone loss to
Michael Moorer, who took the IBF title on a 12th-round TKO. Esquer
worked with Botha every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire the guy,'' said Esquer, a longtime Carbajal
cornerman. ``He can fight, and I don't agree that he doesn't have
power. He's good.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the night he fought Moorer, he just got away from the
things we were trying to tell him. If he moves early, out-boxes
Tyson and then starts throwing combinations, he'll win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Botha corner looms as a potential problem. His trainer is
Panama Lewis. Lewis works with Botha in the gym but is banned from
the corner by the Nevada Athletic Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Lewis was charged with removing padding from the gloves
of middleweight Luis Resto. Billy Collins survived 10 rounds and
died nine months later. Lewis went on to serve two-and-a-half years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lewis has always done what is right with me,'' Botha said. ``I
don't ask him about his history. He paid for what he did. Panama
Lewis still maintains his innocence with me. I can't say whether he
did it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's tough. On fight night, a fighter always needs some
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Tyson, a fighter often needs more than just some. &QL;

WHAT PEOPLE MIGHT NOT KNOW ABOUT SMALLMOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (sidebar to OUT-BASS FISHERMAN) (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Janisch, former head of fisheries for the Arizona Game and
Fish Department, said smallmouth bass traditionally were believed
to be fast-running stream fish until the the 1930s when major lakes
in the north were dammed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't need need running water, it was discovered,'' he
said. ``What they like is gravel bottoms. They want that gravel
like trout to spawn. That unlike largemouth bass that can spawn
almost anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He said smallmouth feed not that much differently that
largemouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``But largemouth will lounge around all kinds of structure,
waiting to feed,'' Janisch said. ``Smallmouth are more attuned to
rocks. It may be a genetic thing. From their days in streams, they
may be more likely to scream in from a rock, kill something and
head back to the rock. That's what they'd do in a stream. They act
more like walleyes or northern pike.''
</P>
<P>
   He said they are much more aggressive than largemouth. That may
be from their stream heritage. Run out from a rock and grab
something. Largemouth, not in lakes, are associated with slower
running streams and backwaters. Smallmouth aren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Largemouth are always exploring,'' Janisch said. ``The
smallmouth is more likely to hunker down in rocks and wait for
something to come by.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Salt River chain of lakes _ Roosevelt, Apache,
Canyon and Saguaro _ imitate Canadian lakes where smallmouths
developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lakes are clear; the water is generally cold,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Janisch agreed with Rob Vander Kooi that the smallmouth are
feeding on crawfish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The are used to scouring the bottom of streams,'' he said.
``That's where they find crawfish. Largemouth aren't used to doing
that. Smallmouth search the gravel bottoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Janisch said in populations of smallmouth, the Salt River chain
of lakes would rank as follows: Apache, Roosevelt, Canyon and
Saguaro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roosevelt would be a better place for smallmouth (because of
it's size and nutrients),'' he said. ``But it has only few areas
where smallmouth can flourish.'' &QL;

ARIZONA FISHERMAN BIG ON SMALLMOUTH  
 VANDER KOOI PLAYS BASS JUST RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
 FISHERMAN-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a Tuesday morning, about 6:30, as Rob Vander Kooi drives
past Roosevelt Lake. The outside temperature, according to the
digital thermometer in his truck, is 28 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   He's suffering from a touch of flu, but the temperature tells
him he'll be even more uncomfortable after launching on Apache
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Kooi, 27, is one of Arizona's top young professional bass
fishermen. He broke out of obscurity regionally and nationally when
he finished second at the B.A.S.S. Western Region tournament on
Lake Shasta in Northern California. He's in the hunt to qualify for
the most prestigious bass fishing tournament in the world, the
Bassmaster Classic next summer.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have the sponsorship to make a comfortable living
from bass fishing, but at the rate he's going, he will.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Kooi will pass Roosevelt for the time being and head down
the Apache Trail to Apache Lake, easily the best for quality
smallmouth bass in Arizona. Lake Powell also has large numbers of
smallmouth, but the size is not as good and only a small part of
the lake is in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Kooi launches in a sand wash at the upper end of Apache.
This is a narrow stretch of the lake below Roosevelt Dam. A wind
from the east is ripping through the narrow canyon. The temperature
is up in the 30s, but the cutting wind makes it feel much colder. A
70-mph run down the lake will compound the cold.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be miserable until the sun clears the surrounding
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Kooi fished a tournament the previous weekend at Apache.
He knows the smallmouth fishing is sporadic. This won't be a good
day. But the goal is to catch a large smallmouth _ four pounds or
better.
</P>
<P>
   He has a passion for smallmouth. He fishes Apache often when not
on the tournament trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the beauty of the fish and their ability to fight,'' he
said. ``I've never seen a fish so talented at getting off the
hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Vander Kooi wants a six-pound smallmouth or better. He'll not be
trying for numbers today. He's after a big fish.
</P>
<P>
   He chooses a large tandem-bladed spinnerbait with a chartreuse
tail. The Yamamoto lure also has a trailer hook, one that follows
the hook on lure itself. Bass often short-hit a lure, meaning they
hit at the far end of the streaming tail. If so, they'll miss the
main hook, but the trailer will get them.
</P>
<P>
   It all goes back to the theory that a large lure catches large
fish. He will retrieve the lure at a medium speed.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Kooi stops first on the flats of Burnt Corral, a camping
and boat-launching site at the upper end of the lake. There is a
large, shallow flat on the edge of the dropoff into the Salt River
channel.
</P>
<P>
   The smallmouth come onto this flat to feed. They are not looking
for threadfin shad, the most common forage fish in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the smallmouth) are feeding on crawdads,'' he said.
Vander Kooi doesn't keep bass, believing that releasing them allows
them to be caught again. But in a tournament, he keeps them in a
livewell in his boat so they can be weighed in. The livewell in a
modern bass boat has pumps to circulate water to make sure the bass
are not killed. After weigh-in, the fish are released.
</P>
<P>
   Bass tend to regurgitate the contents of their stomachs when
contained in a livewell if they've fed recently. Vander Kooi said
his livewell contained exclusively crawfish.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Kooi caught smallmouth this morning but not on a big
bait. Smaller ones worked better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small baits will catch more fish,'' he said. ``Little in-line
spinners (the Panther-Martin is a perfect example) and small
crankbaits (colored in reds and browns to imitate crawfish) might
not catch that big smallmouth, but they'll catch more.''
</P>
<P>
   Vander Kooi is fishing with lures only. But he admits that one
live bait _ crawfish, which are hard to find at this time of year _
undoubtedly will catch more smallmouth on those same flats.
</P>
<P>
   ``On those flats, the lures might not be attracting fish, but I
have no doubt that the smallmouth were there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In late February or early March, Vander Kooi said, the
smallmouth will begin staging for their spawn. That's when fishing
really gets hot. &QL;

PARENTS SHOCKED AS KIDS ASK ABOUT ADULT ISSUES IN CLINTON CASE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The crisp morning air nips at the children's cheeks, making them
ruddy.
</P>
<P>
   On the playground at Kyrene de Los Cerritos, a group of
third-grade boys tears up and down a field, playing tag in their
baggy jeans and sweat shirts. Four girls stand on tip toes in their
platform tennis shoes and see who can last the longest.
</P>
<P>
   A mother marvels at the innocent faces near the playground gate,
where every morning parents talk after dropping off their children.
On this day, she talked about prolonging her daughter's childhood
as long as possible. But already, the presiden tial scandal is
taking its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at them. They don't have a care in the world,'' said
Roberta Williams, whose daughter is in kin dergarten. ``But the
other night, my daughter asked if her daddy would cheat on us like
President Clinton did on his family. I didn't even know she knew
what cheating was.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the question was posed at the dinner table, while
her husband was gone on a business trip. Before responding, she
asked her daughter whether she knew what cheating meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me someone at school told her it's when a daddy or
mommy loves someone else,'' the mother recalled. ``I was shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in schoolyards, far from the nation's Capitol, the
president's in discretions are resonating.
</P>
<P>
   As opening arguments begin to day in the Senate in President
Clin ton's impeachment trial, many parents are bracing again for
the questions that will be inevitably triggered by the drama.
</P>
<P>
   Some children will ask easy ones. Like, what did the president
do wrong? Other queries will be more difficult. Some parents will
be grilled about sex. Extramarital af fairs. The cigar.
</P>
<P>
   Rae Classen, a mother of four who range in age from 5 to 13,
said she's gotten them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had many discussions about President Clinton around our
dinner table. It's horrible,'' said Classen, who is also a Girl
Scout leader.
</P>
<P>
   With her 5-year-old son, Paul, Classen has kept it simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't understand much. But when he asked why the presi
dent was in trouble, we told him that the president lied and when
people lie they get in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The older children, in particular her 13-year-old daughter,
Lauren, have been more challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 13-year-old wants to know why he would do something like
that. She wants to know what Chel sea Clinton must be feeling and
what does she tell her friends. She wants to know how can she
respect the president's office,'' Classen said. ``The office of the
presidency has lost lots of credibility to her genera tion.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents complain that Clin ton has made them explain sex
sooner than they anticipated and un der circumstances they haven't
ex pected.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case for Robert Morton.
</P>
<P>
   He said his 7-year-old son, Jim, came home from school wanting
to know what sex was because he had heard President Clinton got in
trou ble because of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the way I envisioned explaining sex to my son,''
Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had already thought about telling him about falling in love
_ that sex was a way to show someone you love them. But the Clinton
af fair made it so complicated,'' he la mented. ``I had to tell him
that people who don't love each other also have sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the mother of the kin dergartner, shakes her head and
calls it a disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``What example is this setting?'' she asked. She said her
daughter had also asked her whether all grown-ups lie and cheat
like the president. And, would she lie and cheat when she grew up?
</P>
<P>
   The conversation ends when the bell rings. The kids line up. And
Williams waves to her daughter one last time before heading to
work. &QL;

`CROCODILE' BUSTED IN VEGAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Guerilla warfare was stopped Wednesday. Actually, it
was silenced.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas police arrested the man named ``Crocodile,'' a Mike
Tyson cheerleader who wears camouflaged clothes and shouts
``Guerilla warfare'' throughout most pre-fight news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   At the final news conference for Saturday's Tyson-Frans Botha
bout at the MGM Grand, the familiar chant was absent. Police
arrested Crocodile as he headed down the steps and toward the stage
at the MGM's Grand Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Crocodile insisted he had a reason to be with the Tyson
entourage.
</P>
<P>
   No, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, said Crocodile, a longtime Tyson friend whose given name is
Steve Fitch.
</P>
<P>
   Nope, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't arrest me for saying `Guerilla Warfare,' '' said
Crocodile, who gets a reported $100,000 a year to serve as Tyson's
loudest mouthpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Wanna bet, the cops asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guerilla Warfare,'' Crocodile shouted for the last time as he
was handcuffed and led out of the Theater.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour later, Crocodile returned. Apparently, he had been
released. He slipped onto the side of the stage where Tyson sat.
</P>
<P>
   There were no handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Nor one more shout of ``Guerilla Warfare.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sizing up the purse &QL; 
 &QL; 
There will be a better idea about the size of Tyson's purse today,
when Marc Ratner of the Nevada State Athletic Commission is
expected to get copy of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Everything from $15 million to $33 million has been reported.
Tyson has said he's getting $35 million, but the former heavyweight
champion has never been known to keep track of financial figures.
Don King did that for him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ratner said Botha's purse is $1.85 million. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Briefly &QL; 
 &QL; 
London's Fleet Street tabloids have been going wild with a comment
made last week by Tyson while training at Phoenix's Madison Square
Garden. When asked what he expected Botha to do, Tyson said
``Die.'' When asked if he meant it Wednesday, Tyson said:
``Implicitly.''
</P>
<P>
   Windfall: Tyson got almost a quarter of a million dollars this
week, thanks to an Individual Retirement Fund account set up by his
late trainer, Cus D'Amato, in the 1980s. ``I was overwhelmed,''
Tyson said. ``He must have known I was going to screw up the
money.'' &QL;

N.M. ARREST LATEST CHAPTER IN SOLDIER'S STRANGE SAGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Lake Havasu City businessman Harry Christensen met a
potential buyer of his plane for a test flight last week, he
probably heard some dramatic stories about the frozen trenches of
the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   After all, his passenger, Bobby Joe Keesee of Amarillo, Texas,
had been a teenage hero, participating in a daring rescue of U.S.
prisoners and winning the Purple Heart and Bronze Star.
</P>
<P>
   But Christensen probably never heard about Keesee's dark side _
and the big question is whether his ignorance got him killed.
</P>
<P>
   Keesee is many things besides a hero. At 64, he has more than
earned the label given him: ``Soldier of misfortune.''
</P>
<P>
   A hijacker of planes to North Vietnam and Cuba, a conspirator in
the death of a U.S. diplomat, a consummate scam artist who posed as
a CIA agent _ Keesee, 64, and his wife, Hildgund, 52, were arrested
last Thursday in New Mexico after Christensen's plane was found at
an Albuquerque airport.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Joe Keesee was charged Wednesday in Albuquerque with
interstate transportation of a stolen aircraft and air piracy
following a complaint filed by the FBI. Authorities also say Keesee
is a suspect in Christensen's death, though he hasn't been charged
with the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have not found Christensen. They did find a large
pool of what they believe to be Christensen's blood in the back of
his twin-engine Cessna.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For Keesee, it was merely the latest in a long and bizarre
international saga that has landed him in prison for most of the
past 35 years. In some ways, his path seemed unlikely to cross with
that of a popular Lake Havasu City civic leader.
</P>
<P>
   Keesee is ``the most persuasive, intelligent con man I've ever
seen,'' said George Newhouse, a former assistant U.S. attorney who
prosecuted Keesee in a 1996 San Diego case in which the soldier
impersonated a federal emergency management official to procure
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his last three crimes, he's been trying to obtain by
fraudulent means an aircraft which will fly long distances,''
Newhouse said. ``He told federal agents that he wanted to go in the
drug-running business in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, that would have been merely another routine
adventure for Keesee.
</P>
<P>
   His early years were spent on the road of the Texas Panhandle
and western Oklahoma with his father, Peyton, who put on a
traveling vaudeville show, said Keesee's cousin Francis Pamplin of
Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   But in the years after the Korean War, most of his fellow
servicemen felt he'd been content with life as a career Army man.
</P>
<P>
   Keesee had attained his sergeant stripes while stationed at Fort
Huachuca near Sierra Vista. His future seemed secure, if ordinary.
Then one day in early 1962, he left the base, stole a plane in
Texas and flew to Cuba, where he asked Fidel Castro's government
for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The request was denied. Keesee was sent back to this country,
convicted and given two years in prison, despite his claim that he
was a CIA agent pursing secret operations against Castro, according
to news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after getting out of prison in 1964, he was arrested and
convicted of stealing government-owned parachutes.
</P>
<P>
   Next, in 1970, he popped up in Amman, Jordan, as one of 57
hostages being held by Palestinian guerrillas in a hotel. Keesee
gave no explanation as to why he was in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   But the most sensational incidents were yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   Later in 1970, according to Newhouse and press reports, Keesee
hijacked a charter flight in Thailand and ordered it to fly to
North Vietnam. Narrowly avoiding anti-aircraft fire in Laos and
Vietnam, the plane landed on a makeshift strip near the North
Vietnamese coast.
</P>
<P>
   Keesee was taken into custody by a North Vietnamese army unit
and confined in isolation at the infamous ``Hanoi Hilton,'' where
downed American military pilots also were imprisoned. He was
believed to be the only civilian American captive in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Keesee was sent home on the same plane in 1973 as some war
heroes, returning to Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines, where
cameras recorded him kissing the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Keesee, then working as a cabinetmaker in Southern
California, was arrested for conspiracy in the murder of John
Patterson, a U.S. consul posted in Hermosillo, Sonora, in a failed
ransom attempt for $250,000. Keesee was sentenced to 20 years in
prison, yet he denied any role in the death.
</P>
<P>
   During the next 12 years behind bars, Keesee worked filling out
requisitions for purchase orders, Newhouse said. That would lead to
his next scam upon his release in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Posing as a purchasing agent for the U.S. Navy in Seattle,
Keesee was convicted of attempting to bilk a company out of 643,000
pounds of copper and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   He was supposed to go to a halfway house five years later but
violated his parole, went to California and took on the alias
William J. Jamerson. He began posing as an official with the
Federal Emergency Management Agency and entered negotiations to buy
a plane, which he said would be used for FEMA flights to disaster
areas.
</P>
<P>
   A suspicious businessman called the FBI, but Keesee fled before
agents could arrest him. He next surfaced in Toluca, Mexico, where,
posing as a State Department and CIA agent, he persuaded a New
Jersey aviation company to fly in a plane.
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless calling upon skills learned in prison, he supplied
false government documents that he said would cover the purchase
price.
</P>
<P>
   Keesee went to Germany, where he later was arrested and
extradited to New Jersey. He was sentenced to 57 months in prison
for the CIA caper in Mexico. Keesee was returned to California in
late 1995 and convicted of the FEMA scam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm simply amazed he was out of prison now, given his
background,'' Newhouse said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon to follow was the fateful meeting with Christensen, a major
figure in the national boat-racing scene and president of a company
called Advantage Boats.
</P>
<P>
   According to an FBI affidavit filed Wednesday in U.S. District
Court in Albuquerque, Christensen's plane was seen flying
erratically above the Lake Havasu City airport at 9:15 on the
morning of Jan. 6. Christensen's flight equipment, which family
members said he always took, had been left in his vehicle at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   That night in Albuquerque, airport personnel said Keesee exited
the plane alone.
</P>
<P>
   Keesee was found in possession of Christensen property,
including credit cards and Arizona driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents said they could find no trace of Christensen's blood
at the airport. But, in a fittingly odd note, the affidavit says
that Keesee claimed to have been with Christensen at the Lake
Havasu airport when Christensen was shot two times _ without saying
by whom. &QL;

SIBLINGS TAKE ON SYSTEM TO REGAIN THEIR DREAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By VICTORIA HARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the halls of Maricopa County Superior Court, they are famous.
</P>
<P>
   Make that infamous.
</P>
<P>
   They jump up in court to interrupt attorneys and rail at judges.
They mutter darkly about ``massive cover-ups'' and ``Nazi'' court
officials who treat them like ``concentration-camp victims.''
</P>
<P>
   They swear the city of Phoenix is trying to wear them down until
they give up. Or die.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, the Span family was a bunch of gritty strivers
who invested their hopes and sweat in the future of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 10 years and scores of legal battles over the loss of
their beloved homesite, they're chiefly known in the downtown legal
community as a pack of nuisances.
</P>
<P>
   Or worse.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Spans say they are victims of a conspiracy
so punishing that they now need a yearlong legal ``timeout'' to
recover from an affliction called ``legal-abuse syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   Their story traces the decline of a hard-working family that
became a Phoenix institution, only to see its dreams collapse. It
also shows how anguished citizens seeking justice can tie up a
legal system that they've come to view as the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Court Administrator Gordon Griller says the Spans are prime
practitioners of ``vexatious litigation _ coming to court for every
possible redress under the sun, filing large sums of cases, some
even contradictory to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Spans' future once looked bright.
</P>
<P>
   More than 45 years ago, Jack and Virginia Span purchased what
they call their ``golden gateway'' to the future, a chunk of land
near Buckeye Road and 20th Street.
</P>
<P>
   With the airport expanding and a highway planned nearby, they
knew their investment was sound. They instilled in their 10
children the values of owning property and working hard.
</P>
<P>
   Jack was partially disabled, so the kids all worked, renting
cushions their mother sewed and selling popcorn she popped at
sporting events and rodeos. Over three decades, the Spans became
known for selling refreshments at all the ballparks, Memorial
Coliseum and the Arizona State Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Devout pack rats, the Spans collected antiques and artifacts
rich in Arizona history, storing it on their land. One year, they
dismantled brick-by-brick the historic Cole House in Tempe that was
set for demolition. Years later, it was sold and reassembled in
Olde Towne Square in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Every dime the Spans earned they invested in the Buckeye Road
property. As adults, some of the children purchased land next to
their parents'.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1988, the Spans' universe was swept away. Phoenix
condemned the Buckeye land as part of a redevelopment project near
the airport. It evicted the Spans, took possession and hastened the
family's move off the property.
</P>
<P>
   After the condemnation, the Spans filed a legal action, calling
the city's act an illegal land grab.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, two U.S. marshals came onto their property and
assaulted Darlene, Jerry and Virginia, 72, the Span children say.
Jack also was assaulted. He died two months later. Virginia died in
1993, never fully recovering from the attack, the children said.
</P>
<P>
   The marshals claimed it was a case of mistaken identity and
accused Jerry and Darlene of attacking them. The two were found
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   But Darlene would not give up. She went before the 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals _ and won.
</P>
<P>
   The judges said the Spans suffered from inadequate counsel, and
concluded that ``there was reasonable probability that, had the
jury been properly instructed, the Spans would have been
acquitted.''
</P>
<P>
   But the remarkable victory was clouded by other woes. During the
rush to clear their property and make way for the city's
bulldozers, many of the Spans' cherished belongings were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Even more frustrating, their original condemnation suit had
spawned dozens of related lawsuits, appeals and judgments _ many
against them.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, five of the Span children are still in court.
They are determined to get what they believe is a fair amount for
each of their destroyed homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Spans contend they should have received about $2.1 million
for one piece of property. The city offered $650,000. At trial, a
jury awarded $750,000. Still dissatisfied, the Spans appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Their lives now revolve around their many court cases. Darlene,
Jerry, Pete, Michael and Bonnie have filed tens of thousands of
papers in court.
</P>
<P>
   They spend their days preparing filings and meeting court
deadlines. In between, they crash from exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't function,'' Darlene said. ``Everything's in limbo.
They destroyed our businesses, they destroyed our livelihoods and
took our homes in one sweep.''
</P>
<P>
   Their filings are filled with allegations of intimidation,
harassment and violence at the hands of judges and court staff.
</P>
<P>
   One attorney after another has walked off their cases, some for
lack of cooperation, according to court records. One attorney had
to call police to remove Darlene from his office when she refused
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   They include photos of ``bad'' judges and attorneys in their
court who are all part of a ``massive cover-up'' to steal their
property.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials long ago lost patience.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, the Spans have been involved in more than 100 cases
in Superior Court alone, court administrator Griller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their requests . . . in some instances are very confusing and
almost defy an ability to respond in any legal way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the court's hands are tied, he said. It must accept and
review every single document submitted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Spans now say their prolonged dealings with the
court have left them physically and emotionally sick and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   They have made repeated requests for ``accommodations'' for
their disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists have diagnosed the Spans with hearing problems,
learning disabilities, chronic fatigue syndrome and post-traumatic
stress. A ruling is expected soon whether to give the Spans a year
off so they can recover from their trauma.
</P>
<P>
   They first suffered from post-traumatic stress after they were
attacked by the marshals, said Karen Huffer, one of the
psychologists who diagnosed the Spans. Post-traumatic stress is
covered under ADA and should be accommodated, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Their trauma has been aggravated by the prolonged litigation and
they now suffer from ``legal abuse syndrome,'' said Huffer, who
coined the phrase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many attorneys treat the courts as a sport,'' she said. ``They
use character assassination, bullying. They interfere with your
life out of court, call you crazy and laugh at you while you're
struggling to get by in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Spans, she said, ``Each one has lost their career. They
were treated as slovenly junk people. Yet, when you talk to them
they treasure their history. . . . These are the values we want to
preserve.''
</P>
<P>
   But Phoenix officials express little sympathy. They say they've
paid more than $3 million to the Spans for their property and in
relocation costs. More than $1.2 million of the money, however, is
locked up in an account held by Superior Court until the
condemnation case is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The Spans say the rest went for expensive attorneys, expert
witnesses, to pay for the warehouse and other costs. They claim
they live like street people, depending on the charity of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Darlene said it is getting more difficult to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost my looks, my youth, my energy,'' she said. ``I have
no stability, no future. There is no income of any kind. It's all
gone. Everything's gone.'' &QL;

SUNS ASK ABOUT DEAL FOR PIPPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBA sources say the Suns are among the teams that have contacted
the Chicago Bulls to inquire about a possible sign-and-trade deal
for free agent Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't known which players the Suns would offer. They have
only five under contract _ Danny Manning, Jason Kidd, Mark Bryant,
Martin Muursepp and Bubba Wells.
</P>
<P>
   But NBA rules now allow free agents to be signed and then
traded, so the Suns could put together a package of players,
including some of their own free agents, in a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen will be looking for a contract that begins at $14
million, so he would have to sign with Chicago, then the combined
contracts from Phoenix would have to approach his number.
</P>
<P>
   But the sources said virtually every NBA team has made the same
call to the Bulls, trying to determine what _ if anything _ could
make a deal work.
</P>
<P>
   The more likely scenario is that Pippen will simply sign a
free-agent contract, and the Houston Rockets are the leading
suitors, according to various league sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rockets have interest,'' Pippen's agent, Jimmy Sexton,
told the Houston Chronicle. ``Scottie has interest. It's something
he's considering strongly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really makes it look so inviting, with Charles (Barkley),
Hakeem (Olajuwon) and Scottie, that's a three-person nucleus that's
very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Suns General Manager Bryan Colangelo would not comment on the
Pippen speculation. &QL;  &QL; 
Chuck Wagon &QL;  &QL; 
Barkley, the Rockets' free-agent forward, made his first appearance
at America West Arena for informal workouts Wednesday. Free-agent
players can work out at any NBA facility, and Barkley has a home in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said he has been contacted by six NBA teams, including
Seattle and New York.
</P>
<P>
   So where will he be playing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Palm Springs,'' Barkley quipped. ``At the Bob Hope Classic.''
</P>
<P>
   NBA training camps are expected to open Monday or Tuesday, but
Barkley said he'll be playing golf along with Michael Jordan and
other celebrities at the Hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made a decision,'' he said. ``I want to sit down and
talk to the six teams. I'm going to sit back and be patient. I'm
not in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   The most likely scenario is that Barkley will end up back in
Houston. The Rockets are pursuing a big-name free agent, such as
Pippen or the Suns' Antonio McDyess. And that will limit what the
Rockets can give Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Scottie (Tuesday) night,'' Barkley said. ``He's
going to wait till next week to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Rockets add a key player, Barkley is likely to play for
less money to get one more shot at a championship. The Rockets
could sign him to a one-year deal for $1 million, but do it on the
salary cap instead of as a minimum exception and he still would
retain his Larry Bird rights _ and the ability to get a big
contract next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make my decision when everybody signs,'' Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, who had double-hernia and elbow surgery after last
season, appears to be in good condition after working with
Phoenix-based fitness expert Mack Newton last summer. &QL;  &QL; 
New faces &QL;  &QL; 
Barkley wasn't the only new face at the workouts. Muursepp made his
first appearance Wednesday. The 6-foot-9 forward was traded to
Phoenix on draft day as part of the deal that sent Steve Nash to
the Dallas Mavericks. He flirted with some European clubs during
the lockout, but never signed to play with any because they would
not give him a release to rejoin the Suns if the lockout ended. &QL;  &QL; 
Exhibitions set &QL;  &QL; 
The Suns announced the dates of their two preseason games, and
Muursepp won't have to wait long to see his former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns will play the Dallas Mavericks in both preseason
contests. The first is at Dallas on Jan. 30. The Mavericks will
visit Phoenix for a Feb. 1 game that tips off at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no charge for admission. &QL;  &QL;

<P>
   In the halls of Maricopa County Superior Court, they are famous.
</P>
<P>
   Make that infamous.
</P>
<P>
   They jump up in court to interrupt attorneys and rail at judges.
They mutter darkly about ``massive cover-ups'' and ``Nazi'' court
officials who treat them like ``concentration-camp victims.''
</P>
<P>
   They swear the city of Phoenix is trying to wear them down until
they give up. Or die.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, the Span family was a bunch of gritty strivers
who invested their hopes and sweat in the future of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 10 years and scores of legal battles over the loss of
their beloved homesite, they're chiefly known in the downtown legal
community as a pack of nuisances.
</P>
<P>
   Or worse.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Spans say they are victims of a conspiracy
so punishing that they now need a yearlong legal ``timeout'' to
recover from an affliction called ``legal-abuse syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   Their story traces the decline of a hard-working family that
became a Phoenix institution, only to see its dreams collapse. It
also shows how anguished citizens seeking justice can tie up a
legal system that they've come to view as the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Court Administrator Gordon Griller says the Spans are prime
practitioners of ``vexatious litigation _ coming to court for every
possible redress under the sun, filing large sums of cases, some
even contradictory to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Spans' future once looked bright.
</P>
<P>
   More than 45 years ago, Jack and Virginia Span purchased what
they call their ``golden gateway'' to the future, a chunk of land
near Buckeye Road and 20th Street.
</P>
<P>
   With the airport expanding and a highway planned nearby, they
knew their investment was sound. They instilled in their 10
children the values of owning property and working hard.
</P>
<P>
   Jack was partially disabled, so the kids all worked, renting
cushions their mother sewed and selling popcorn she popped at
sporting events and rodeos. Over three decades, the Spans became
known for selling refreshments at all the ballparks, Memorial
Coliseum and the Arizona State Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Devout pack rats, the Spans collected antiques and artifacts
rich in Arizona history, storing it on their land. One year, they
dismantled brick-by-brick the historic Cole House in Tempe that was
set for demolition. Years later, it was sold and reassembled in
Olde Towne Square in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Every dime the Spans earned they invested in the Buckeye Road
property. As adults, some of the children purchased land next to
their parents'.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1988, the Spans' universe was swept away. Phoenix
condemned the Buckeye land as part of a redevelopment project near
the airport. It evicted the Spans, took possession and hastened the
family's move off the property.
</P>
<P>
   After the condemnation, the Spans filed a legal action, calling
the city's act an illegal land grab.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, two U.S. marshals came onto their property and
assaulted Darlene, Jerry and Virginia, 72, the Span children say.
Jack also was assaulted. He died two months later. Virginia died in
1993, never fully recovering from the attack, the children said.
</P>
<P>
   The marshals claimed it was a case of mistaken identity and
accused Jerry and Darlene of attacking them. The two were found
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   But Darlene would not give up. She went before the 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals _ and won.
</P>
<P>
   The judges said the Spans suffered from inadequate counsel, and
concluded that ``there was reasonable probability that, had the
jury been properly instructed, the Spans would have been
acquitted.''
</P>
<P>
   But the remarkable victory was clouded by other woes. During the
rush to clear their property and make way for the city's
bulldozers, many of the Spans' cherished belongings were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Even more frustrating, their original condemnation suit had
spawned dozens of related lawsuits, appeals and judgments _ many
against them.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, five of the Span children are still in court.
They are determined to get what they believe is a fair amount for
each of their destroyed homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Spans contend they should have received about $2.1 million
for one piece of property. The city offered $650,000. At trial, a
jury awarded $750,000. Still dissatisfied, the Spans appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Their lives now revolve around their many court cases. Darlene,
Jerry, Pete, Michael and Bonnie have filed tens of thousands of
papers in court.
</P>
<P>
   They spend their days preparing filings and meeting court
deadlines. In between, they crash from exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't function,'' Darlene said. ``Everything's in limbo.
They destroyed our businesses, they destroyed our livelihoods and
took our homes in one sweep.''
</P>
<P>
   Their filings are filled with allegations of intimidation,
harassment and violence at the hands of judges and court staff.
</P>
<P>
   One attorney after another has walked off their cases, some for
lack of cooperation, according to court records. One attorney had
to call police to remove Darlene from his office when she refused
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   They include photos of ``bad'' judges and attorneys in their
court who are all part of a ``massive cover-up'' to steal their
property.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials long ago lost patience.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, the Spans have been involved in more than 100 cases
in Superior Court alone, court administrator Griller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their requests . . . in some instances are very confusing and
almost defy an ability to respond in any legal way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the court's hands are tied, he said. It must accept and
review every single document submitted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Spans now say their prolonged dealings with the
court have left them physically and emotionally sick and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   They have made repeated requests for ``accommodations'' for
their disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists have diagnosed the Spans with hearing problems,
learning disabilities, chronic fatigue syndrome and post-traumatic
stress. A ruling is expected soon whether to give the Spans a year
off so they can recover from their trauma.
</P>
<P>
   They first suffered from post-traumatic stress after they were
attacked by the marshals, said Karen Huffer, one of the
psychologists who diagnosed the Spans. Post-traumatic stress is
covered under ADA and should be accommodated, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Their trauma has been aggravated by the prolonged litigation and
they now suffer from ``legal abuse syndrome,'' said Huffer, who
coined the phrase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many attorneys treat the courts as a sport,'' she said. ``They
use character assassination, bullying. They interfere with your
life out of court, call you crazy and laugh at you while you're
struggling to get by in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Spans, she said, ``Each one has lost their career. They
were treated as slovenly junk people. Yet, when you talk to them
they treasure their history. . . . These are the values we want to
preserve.''
</P>
<P>
   But Phoenix officials express little sympathy. They say they've
paid more than $3 million to the Spans for their property and in
relocation costs. More than $1.2 million of the money, however, is
locked up in an account held by Superior Court until the
condemnation case is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The Spans say the rest went for expensive attorneys, expert
witnesses, to pay for the warehouse and other costs. They claim
they live like street people, depending on the charity of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Darlene said it is getting more difficult to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost my looks, my youth, my energy,'' she said. ``I have
no stability, no future. There is no income of any kind. It's all
gone. Everything's gone.'' &QL;

SUNS ASK ABOUT DEAL FOR PIPPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBA sources say the Suns are among the teams that have contacted
the Chicago Bulls to inquire about a possible sign-and-trade deal
for free agent Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't known which players the Suns would offer. They have
only five under contract _ Danny Manning, Jason Kidd, Mark Bryant,
Martin Muursepp and Bubba Wells.
</P>
<P>
   But NBA rules now allow free agents to be signed and then
traded, so the Suns could put together a package of players,
including some of their own free agents, in a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen will be looking for a contract that begins at $14
million, so he would have to sign with Chicago, then the combined
contracts from Phoenix would have to approach his number.
</P>
<P>
   But the sources said virtually every NBA team has made the same
call to the Bulls, trying to determine what _ if anything _ could
make a deal work.
</P>
<P>
   The more likely scenario is that Pippen will simply sign a
free-agent contract, and the Houston Rockets are the leading
suitors, according to various league sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rockets have interest,'' Pippen's agent, Jimmy Sexton,
told the Houston Chronicle. ``Scottie has interest. It's something
he's considering strongly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really makes it look so inviting, with Charles (Barkley),
Hakeem (Olajuwon) and Scottie, that's a three-person nucleus that's
very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Suns General Manager Bryan Colangelo would not comment on the
Pippen speculation. &QL;  &QL; 
Chuck Wagon &QL;  &QL; 
Barkley, the Rockets' free-agent forward, made his first appearance
at America West Arena for informal workouts Wednesday. Free-agent
players can work out at any NBA facility, and Barkley has a home in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said he has been contacted by six NBA teams, including
Seattle and New York.
</P>
<P>
   So where will he be playing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Palm Springs,'' Barkley quipped. ``At the Bob Hope Classic.''
</P>
<P>
   NBA training camps are expected to open Monday or Tuesday, but
Barkley said he'll be playing golf along with Michael Jordan and
other celebrities at the Hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made a decision,'' he said. ``I want to sit down and
talk to the six teams. I'm going to sit back and be patient. I'm
not in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   The most likely scenario is that Barkley will end up back in
Houston. The Rockets are pursuing a big-name free agent, such as
Pippen or the Suns' Antonio McDyess. And that will limit what the
Rockets can give Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Scottie (Tuesday) night,'' Barkley said. ``He's
going to wait till next week to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Rockets add a key player, Barkley is likely to play for
less money to get one more shot at a championship. The Rockets
could sign him to a one-year deal for $1 million, but do it on the
salary cap instead of as a minimum exception and he still would
retain his Larry Bird rights _ and the ability to get a big
contract next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make my decision when everybody signs,'' Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, who had double-hernia and elbow surgery after last
season, appears to be in good condition after working with
Phoenix-based fitness expert Mack Newton last summer. &QL;  &QL; 
New faces &QL;  &QL; 
Barkley wasn't the only new face at the workouts. Muursepp made his
first appearance Wednesday. The 6-foot-9 forward was traded to
Phoenix on draft day as part of the deal that sent Steve Nash to
the Dallas Mavericks. He flirted with some European clubs during
the lockout, but never signed to play with any because they would
not give him a release to rejoin the Suns if the lockout ended. &QL;  &QL; 
Exhibitions set &QL;  &QL; 
The Suns announced the dates of their two preseason games, and
Muursepp won't have to wait long to see his former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns will play the Dallas Mavericks in both preseason
contests. The first is at Dallas on Jan. 30. The Mavericks will
visit Phoenix for a Feb. 1 game that tips off at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no charge for admission. &QL;  &QL;

short term loans. That combination, says Jeffrey Sachs of the

   COKE-BOOKS (Undated) _ ``Have you seen them?'' asked Carole
Baron, the president and publisher of Dell Publishing and Delacorte
Press. ``They're cute.'' Indeed they are. Cute was exactly the word
that came to mind when I first set eyes on the six little books
that will, beginning in February, be distributed on supermarket
shelves, tucked inside some 40 million 12- and 24-packs of Diet
Coke. Four inches by six inches, roughly 30 pages thick, these
excerpts of forthcoming works by best-selling authors are adorable.

clicked. It was just her husband, Glen. He had shoved off on his

   DOG-FRIEND (Undated) _ Hemingway is not my dog. He belongs to

him. He's beautiful, all white with big black liquid eyes and a big

of sheep to tend. I started to walk him every morning because I
felt sorry for him, and now, as soon as he hears my coffee grinder,
he starts howling. By Anne Raver.

FRANCHIONE, TCU NEAR DEAL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU and football coach Dennis Franchione
aren't ``too far away'' from reaching an agreement on a contract
extension, according to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   TCU appears willing to offer an extension worth $700,000 to $1
million a season for approximately seven seasons, according to
sources close to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can neither confirm nor deny any specifics that deal with
\RFranchione's\S contract,'' Horned Frogs athletic director Eric
Hyman said. ``Discussions are ongoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyman presented Franchione with an initial offer Saturday before
Franchione left for a coaching convention in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, both sides have been talking back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione returned yesterday and said he has not interviewed
for Colorado's coaching vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interviewing for any other jobs,'' Franchione said.
``I'm interested in working things out with TCU.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione has five years remaining on a contract that pays him
approximately $450,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   TCU finished its first season under Franchione at 7-5, including
a 28-19 upset of Southern California in the Sun Bowl on Dec. 31.
The Horned Frogs were 1-10 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   TCU and Franchione had hoped to sign a deal before this weekend,
a big weekend for recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a deal appears unlikely to be completed before next
week.

VILLANOVA HANDS BC 5TH STRAIGHT LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLLEGE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The long and winding road back to Big East
prominence already loomed as a difficult journey for Boston
College's young, inexperienced basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   But the Eagles took an important step Wednesday night, battling
back from a pair of 14-point deficits in the second half to pull
within 3 before succumbing to the errors of their youth and
inexperience _ and, oh yes, a pair of back-breaking 3-pointers by
Brian Lynch in the final 1:50. The result: a 76-67 loss to
Villanova before a sellout crowd of 6,500 at the Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a team standpoint, for 40 minutes, we got a fine
effort,'' said BC coach Al Skinner, who got a similar effort in a
91-78 loss to top-ranked Connecticut last Wednesday at Conte Forum.
``If we continue to do this, then we've just got to find a way to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwarfed by Villanova's frontcourt, which outrebounded them,
52-25, the Eagles did not shrink from the fight, forcing 21
turnovers while committing a season-low nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were going to have trouble rebounding the
basketball, we knew that was going to be a problem for us, so there
were other things we had to do,'' Skinner said. ``Guys worked extra
hard to get the job done, but now it's coming down to small
mistakes _ mental errors and experience in certain situations.
Lynch got open because of our lack of experience. But I can't fault
us for that. We've got to learn from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its gritty effort, BC (3-11, 0-6) suffered its fifth
straight loss and ninth in 10 games. It also was the Eagles' second
consecutive conference setback on the road, following an 86-70
defeat at Pittsburgh Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hadn't gone away in any tape (his team had seen),'' said
Villanova coach Steve Lappas, lauding BC's effort after the
Wildcats (12-5, 3-4) got a game-high 19 points from senior guard
John Celestand. ``How about this? The closest game Connecticut had
at halftime this year was them.''
</P>
<P>
   So Lappas was not surprised when Willie Deane, who came off the
bench to lead BC with 14 points, helped carve into a 61-47 deficit
by scoring the last 8 points in a 14-3 run. Deane went to the line
courtesy of Celestand's second personal and made two free throws
that cut Villanova's lead to 64-61 with 2:54 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to go for the jugular and we saw that they were on
their heels,'' said Deane. ``But they called a timeout and tried to
regain themselves. But we tried to keep the pressure on them and
make them make big shots in the clutch. Unfortunately, they made
them and we let it slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the game at Pitt, where BC trailed by as many as 26
points in the first half and 49-27 at intermission, there was no
such letdown against Villanova. BC led by as many as 6 in the early
going before allowing the Wildcats to rally from a 19-16 deficit to
a 23-21 lead on a 7-2 burst capped by a pair of rim-bending dunks
from 7-footer Rafal Bigus (4 points, 6 rebounds).
</P>
<P>
   Malik Allen chipped in 14 points, 8 rebounds, and a career-high
6 blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a nagging back injury, BC's Brian Ross, gamely fought in
the low post to score 11 points on 4-for-8 shooting. While Ross was
resting, Jonathan Beerbohm provided some relief by contributing 8
points, 2 rebounds, 3 steals, and 2 blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand this is a big step to a long journey,'' Deane
said. ``We're getting better in each road game and in each
practice. But the team, along with myself, we are not content with
playing well and losing.''

CRUZ FUELS UMASS WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ It took nearly four months, 14 games, several
retreats to the drawing board, and a seemingly endless array of
shots clanging off rims, but the University of Massachusetts
appears finally to have found a consistent perimeter scoring
threat. Just ask the Mullins Center crowd of 5,308 who watched the
host Minutemen defeat Atlantic 10 foe Duquesne, 69-55, Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   With 19:04 remaining in the game and UMass ahead, 34-20, fans
began chanting, ``Put Cruz in,'' referring to seldom-used sophomore
guard Rafael Cruz, a textbook shooter from Wheeling, W.Va., who
finished the first half with a career-high 10 points, including 2
for 2 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bruiser Flint, who used Cruz early in part because
starting point guard Charlton Clarke was hampered with inflamed
tendinitis in both knees, reinserted Cruz at the 17-minute mark,
and the guard entered to a rousing ovation from the crowd, who
seemed eager to see more of a player who could ignite an offense
that has struggled all season.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, whose playing time has been limited in part because his
ballhandling skills and defense aren't as good as his shooting
stroke, provided the spark with 14:44 left after Duquesne closed
the gap to 35-24. Cruz promptly sank a trey, putting the Minutemen
ahead by 14. With 13:02 left, he sank another trey, putting UMass
up, 43-26.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the team needs a spark off the bench,'' said Cruz, who
left the game to another ovation, finishing with 16 points on
5-for-6 shooting, including 4 for 4 from behind the 3-point line.
``Sometimes we go five or six minutes without scoring and we need
someone who probably isn't going to score 20 points a night to be a
spark. I'd like to be that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz helped the Minutemen finish with a season-high 10 treys. So
impressive was he that Flint said he very well could be the team's
scoring threat off the bench for the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He broke the game open in the second half by knocking down
those two 3s. That was pretty much the game for (Duquesne),'' said
Flint, whose team shot 51 percent from the floor en route to
improving to 6-8 overall, 3-1 in the league. ``I keep telling him
that it's not all about scoring. For him to play, he has to defend
and take care of the ball. I said to him on the bench that `it's
not just about shooting because those nights when you're not
shooting well, I can't put you in.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz wasn't the only contributor. Clarke didn't start for the
first time in 72 games but tallied 11 points and four assists in 23
minutes and converted three of four treys. Starting shooting guard
Monty Mack led all scorers with 19 points, connecting on three of
six treys.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen's outside shooting caught many off guard,
including Duquesne coach Darelle Porter. ``Cruz comes in and hits a
few shots. We didn't know if Charlton was going to play, and he
limps in and hits a few shots,'' said Porter, whose team trailed,
34-18, at halftime after shooting 25 percent from the floor and
fell to 4-10, 0-4.
</P>
<P>
   UMass could not have found a better time to open up its offense.
Next up for the Minutemen is 15th-ranked Kansas. ``Coach Flint told
us after the game that no one will think we'll have a shot against
them,'' said Clarke, ``so we have to go out and prove everyone
wrong.''

JORDAN'S FAREWELL NOT TRAGEDY, JUST GOODBYE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Thank goodness Michael Jordan finally surfaced in
Chicago on Wednesday. Until we saw him resplendent in a dark suit
that contrasted quite nicely with the spotlight's white-hot glare,
we couldn't be sure if it was Jordan's career that was being laid
to rest or the man himself.
</P>
<P>
   From the time the word leaked out Monday night that the NBA's
greatest player was retiring after 13 seasons it has been
all-Michael, all-the-time. Not since Princess Diana's untimely
death on the penultimate day of August in 1997 has one person been
canonized in so many newsprint inches and broadcast minutes and
radio talk-show hours.
</P>
<P>
   It scared us a little, to awaken to pundits pontificating about
Jordan and saying it was a sad day for the NBA and for basketball
fans worldwide. We heard that and a sick feeling settled in the pit
of our stomach and there was ringing in our ears and for a moment
we thought we were going to faint.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a second! He's just announcing he's quitting a game, right?
It's not like he's going to clear his throat into a microphone and
tell us he's HIV-positive, like Magic Johnson did in Nov. of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Now that was a sad day for the NBA and for basketball fans
worldwide, the dark before it dawned on us all that Johnson's
confidence wasn't misplaced when he gamely took up the gauntlet
against AIDS as though it were just another opponent in a Celtics
or Pistons jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Then we saw a teammate of Jordan's from Laney High in
Wilmington, N.C., being interviewed and heard people talking about
the icon in the past tense and listened incredulously as one person
talked about the ``wake-like atmosphere'' and we really panicked.
Ohmigod, please tell us the news of the day wasn't that Jordan's
career had been cut short along with his life in some plane crash,
the same as Roberto Clemente and Thurman Munson.
</P>
<P>
   Now that would have been the basketball world's darkest hour, to
be denied forevermore not only Jordan's above-the-rim acrobatics
and last-second theatrics but also his smile and transcendent
presence.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no small relief for us to see Jordan's smile light his
path to the podium for his packed press conference. We can endure
the end of his brilliant playing career as long as we know Jordan
will go on.
</P>
<P>
   That sets us apart from the poor, misguided souls who sniped
about Jordan, 35, not affording his faithful fans in every NBA
outpost one final chance to bid him a fond farewell.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the nerve, choosing to drive his three kids to and from
school over driving to the basket in Indianapolis and Denver and
L.A. How dare Jordan put his family before his fans!
</P>
<P>
   Part of Jordan's appeal has always been that he wasn't born with
springs in his legs and a silver spoon in his mouth. He was cut
from his high school squad _ an Everyman's experience if ever one
existed. And although he went on to enjoy a stellar three seasons
at the University of North Carolina, no one believed the third
player chosen in the 1984 draft would become one of the greatest
athletes of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   To have lived all these years vicariously through Jordan is to
wonder why he'd chuck his still-sublime skills on the basketball
court for something as ordinary as schlepping his kids around town.
The simple truth is, even as one of his sponsors exhorts us to ``be
like Mike,'' Jordan yearns to be like us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy taking my kids to school,'' Jordan said. ``I'll enjoy
picking them up from school and ... watching my kids play. Those
are the things that seem so simple in a lot of peoples' lives but
have never really been enjoyed by me. I look forward to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan can appreciate the value of having a dad around. He once
said of his father, James, ``I think my father saw some things in
me that I couldn't see in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   James Jordan was the victim of a botched robbery attempt in
1993. His death and the accidental drownings a decade earlier of
two close friends were enduring lessons to Jordan that athletic
immortality doesn't inure a person to life's temporalness.
</P>
<P>
   As a chapter was closed in his life and in the storied history
of the NBA, it was fitting that the player who defied gravity
nightly would disaffirm the gravity surrounding his retirement.
Jordan did just that by noting at the start of his farewell speech
that there are ``a lot of other serious things happening in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   You know, things like the impeachment of President Clinton, U.S.
warplanes being fired at in Iraq, children starving to death in
Sudan, the Y2K bug, killer bees, yada, yada, yada.
</P>
<P>
   In case you're curious, his future plans don't include saving
the world. ``I don't think I can solve the world's problems,'' he
said in response to a question.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, if Jordan and his wife, Juanita, are able to rear
three well-adjusted, level-headed kids they'll have done more
toward that end than a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan didn't just lend his name to a sweet-smelling cologne, he
provided a salve for the working stiff. His purpose, as he saw it,
beyond winning championships, was ``to alleviate some of the
pressures of everyday life for people who work 9 to 5.''
</P>
<P>
   So how is society's supporting cast supposed to cope now? The
answer can be found in Jordan's advice for the Bulls and their fans
in year 1 A.M. (after Mike).
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to survive without Michael Jordan,'' he said,
``is to start to live without him.''

   LAS VEGAS _ Mike Tyson didn't have much to say at the final
press conference before his comeback bout against Francois Botha on
Saturday at the MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
   He did his talking the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed by television reporters Tuesday night, Tyson was at
his disgusting best, spilling an abundant supply of venom in words
that don't belong on TV or in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In a short interview with NBC's Fred Roggin, Tyson was asked
about people who judge him without knowing him. His response was a
profanity-laced tirade.
</P>
<P>
   And that was only one example, during a few minutes' discussion.
He also ended up in a confrontation with a New York anchor _ a
prematurely stopped interview that ended with Tyson cursing the
interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   Roggin, for one, feels sorry for the tormented fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think after all this time, he'd have the presence of
mind to realize he's being interviewed,'' Roggin said. ``He feels
just so beaten down as a person that it just doesn't matter any
more what he says, that his persona is so bad he can't do anything
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at bottom. It can't get any worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, who makes a habit of losing his cool, maintained control
_ as per instructions from his handlers _ at the all-but-useless
and sparsely attended news conference in a huge MGM theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put a muzzle on me,'' Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
   Not soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   Little interest?: The press conference in no way resembled past
Tyson press conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other fights, only a few hundred members of the media
showed up _ if that _ and no fans were seen in or around the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that ticket sales reportedly have been very
slow.
</P>
<P>
   The company you keep: Panama Lewis, Botha's trainer the past
four years, was banned permanently from working the corner in
professional fights after he was convicted of removing the padding
from the gloves of one his boxers before a fight in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   In that bout, now-retired Luis Resto beat the face of Billy
Collins so badly that he had to retire. Collins suffered a torn
iris in his right eye and would have permanent blurred vision.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year later, Collins, broke and depressed, was killed
in a car accident. He was 22.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who has never admitted he played a role in the affair,
and Resto each spent 2{ years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Botha, although sensitive to the tragedy, supports his trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always done what's right with me,'' he said. ``I don't
ask him about history. He paid for what he did. I think it's a
shame. They took everything away from him...
</P>
<P>
   ``(He) still maintains his innocence with me. I can't say
whether he did it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   More cheating: Botha also broke the rules, although his
indiscretion didn't end so tragically.
</P>
<P>
   He defeated Axel Schulz to win the vacant IBF title in 1995 but
his championship was revoked when he tested positive for steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Botha contends he took the drugs only because it was prescribed
for an arm injury.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Tyson reportedly is negotiating to fight Schulz in his
next fight if he beats Botha.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible opponent? Believe it or not, George Foreman.
Promoter Bob Arum, who has rights to Foreman if he meets Tyson, has
made an offer pending the result of Saturday's fight....
</P>
<P>
   Most observers have praised Tyson and his handlers for choosing
Tommy Brooks as the fighter's latest trainer. Lewis prefers Brooks
over Kevin Rooney, who guided Tyson early in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe Tyson was never the same after he split with
Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they hired Rooney, then I'd be worried,'' Lewis said....
</P>
<P>
   Heavyweight Lance Whitaker of Northridge, who faces Alex Stewart
in the biggest fight of his career, could end up with a much bigger
fight before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   America Presents matchmaker Tom Brown said he expects Whitaker
to face Michael Grant if he wins. Whitaker is 6-foot-8, Grant 6-7.

DOLPHINS ARE EXPECTING JIMMY JOHNSON TO QUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It appears likely that Jimmy Johnson's career as coach
of the Miami Dolphins is over after three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is expected to announce his resignation at a news
conference 11 A.M. on Thursday. He will meet with H. Wayne
Huizenga, the Dolphins' owner, and then the team's players before
meeting the news media, Fox News reported.
</P>
<P>
   Huizenga, in California to complete the sale of the Florida
Marlins, flew back to Miami late Wednesday night, apparently to
meet with Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who told several friends when he took the job in 1996
that he would likely coach no more than three years, has compiled a
28-23 regular season record and was 1-2 in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   This season the Dolphins finished 11-7, but were routed last
Saturday by the Denver Broncos, 38-3, in an American Football
Conference divisional game.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson cut short his post-game remarks and reportedly was
distraught on the four-hour plane ride home. He has not met with
the news media since then.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's mother, Allene, died on Dec. 20, the day before the
Dolphins played perhaps their best game under Johnson _ a 31-21
victory over Denver on ``Monday Night Football.'' The coach stayed
on the sideline for that game before joining his family in Texas
for the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   There were other signs that this season was among Johnson's most
stressful. After the Dolphins defeated Buffalo in a dramatic
first-round playoff game, Johnson admitted that he was drained. He
went to a Pro Player Stadium suite where he usually met coaches and
their wives and friends, flopped on a couch and watched television.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted to do was be a vegetable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson scattered Flutie Flakes in the locker room after the
victory, a direct slam at Buffalo quarterback Doug Flutie, whose
cereal benefits autistic children, including Flutie's son Doug Jr.
Johnson received a torrent of criticism for that and later wrote an
apology to Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson never had a great relationship with the veteran
quarterback Dan Marino, but Marino acknowledged that if he were a
coach, he would want to be like Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   CNN-SI reported that Marino was informed on Wednesday night and
told to be at the team headquarters on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love his discipline,'' Marino said this season. ``That's
something you need if you want to be the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson won two Super Bowls in five seasons as the Dallas
Cowboys' head coach beofre coming to Miami to replace Don Shula. He
also had one national title and two second-place finishes in five
seasons at the University of Miami, where he posted a 52-9 record.
</P>
<P>
   His first head coaching job was at Oklahoma State in 1979, and
he had a 30-25 record in five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's National Football League record is 79-60.
</P>
<P>
   During the season, Johnson was critical of the second-guessing
by the Miami news media. In one news conference the day after the
Denver loss, he launched into a defense of his collegiate drafts.
</P>
<P>
   He had received criticism for not drafting Randy Moss, a wide
receiver who led the NFL in touchdown receptions this season with
17 for the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was out of coaching in 1994 and 1995, when he became an
analyst with Fox. He also was able to spend plenty of time on his
boat, Three Rings, named for his championships.
</P>
<P>
   When he signed with the Dolphins, he thought he might have to
rename his boat. But his Dolphins teams never have got close to
giving the coach title No. 4. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said recently that he believed that the Dolphins needed
only a couple of offensive playmakers for the team to join the
elite level of the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told our players that you need to win enough games during
the season to get a bye, get people healthy and get ready for an
opponent,'' Johnson said. ``We didn't win enough games during the
season to get that advantage.'' &QL;

USC'S PAC-10 RECORD SHOWS CONFERENCE BALANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Center Brian Scalabrine believes USC's 2-2 record
in the Pacific-10 Conference is about right. He just thinks the
Trojans have won and lost the wrong games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be 0-4 (in conference), but we could be 4-0,''
Scalabrine said. ``I think we should have won the games we lost and
lost the games we won.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine believes the conference is so balanced, a lot of
teams could end up with records near .500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stanford is incredibly good. I think everybody else is
in-between,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Iron man: Scalabrine played 45 minutes in last week's overtime
loss to Oregon State. The last USC player to go that long was
Harold Miner, who played 45 minutes in an overtime game against
Arizona State on Jan. 13, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine continues to lead the Trojans (10-3, 2-2) in scoring
(15.8 points) and rebounding (7.7 per game).
</P>
<P>
   Not bitter: USC coach Henry Bibby is also pragmatic about the
Trojans' current Pac-10 standing, especially last Saturday's tough
overtime loss to Oregon that cost them a chance to sweep the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably should have been 1-1,'' Bibby said. ``There's no
way we win the Oregon game but probably by the grace of God.''
</P>
<P>
   USC defeated Oregon on Adam Spanich's midcourt shot at the
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Where's Turner?: Junior forward Jarvis Turner, expected to be
one of the most important players on the team, has played just five
minutes in each of the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby said Turner's playing time has been reduced because of the
emergence of freshman Sam Clancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Clancy has established himself as a starter at power
forward and is just getting better with each game,'' Bibby said.
``Jarvis hasn't had a lot of time. Other guys have been playing
well. There's hasn't been any room.''

WHERE HAS ALL THE SNOWFALL GONE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WRIGHTWOOD, Calif. _ There is a pleasant contradiction brewing
in the local mountains: The snowfall stinks; the skiing's super.
</P>
<P>
   Without any white to Los Angeles' highest backdrop _ the San
Gabriel Mountains, normally the greatest billboard ad for regional
ski areas _ the perception is there's no snow to ski on. And with
lowland temperatures in the mid-70s, who in their right mind would
think about strapping on the boards when there is boating, biking
and the beach to think about?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was driving up here, I thought I got duped. I thought,
oh my God, I'm a sucker,'' said Richard Roberts of Eagle Rock, an
advanced-intermediate skier who hadn't carved any turns in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   But after taking 11 runs by 11:30 a.m. Tuesday at Mountain High
Resort in the San Gabriel Mountains, he had seen the light.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a heck of a lot better than I expected,'' Roberts
said. ``It's better than no snow at all.''
</P>
<P>
   By Jove, Richard's got it: Better than no snow at all. With the
advent of snowmaking and high-tech grooming machines, natural snow
is obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not all packed up and gone home,'' said Bear Mountain
spokeswoman Judi Bowers, who keeps snow totals at the Big Bear Lake
resort in the San Bernardino Mountains. ``That couldn't be farther
from the truth. We can live with a foot of snow, very easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Skiers and snowboarders were terribly spoiled by the winter of
1997-98, when coverage was so complete at Big Bear Lake's Snow
Summit that locals there were schussing over off-trail areas that
hadn't seen the bottoms of skis since the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Tree-skiing is a thing of the past this year. Access is limited
to main runs lined with snowmaking devices. Not a scrap of snow can
be found on peripheral runs.
</P>
<P>
   If you're into winter scenery, forget it. There's no hint of
wind-blown icicles clinging to the pines, only acres of dirt broken
up occasionally by narrow shoots of man-made snow. No need for ski
boundary signs; the brush, rocks and mud speak for themselves. It's
an unusual contrast that skiers might liken it to the end of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   But this is winter in the Southland at its finest; last season
was an anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you live in Southern California, you don't really expect
to have the type of terrain you're going to find in Colorado,''
snowboarder Andreas Herr of Huntington Beach said under Mountain
High's Blue Ridge chairlift. ``It's an added bonus if it does pour
down snow like it did last year, which only comes every once in a
while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, the conditions are nice now. It's spring in the middle
of winter.''
</P>
<P>
   I was a victim of the misperception that no snowfall means bad
skiing. Heck, there are even advantages to lower snowfall and hills
o' brown: great road conditions but fewer crowds, no avalanches or
off-trail enticements for boarders to get lost in and no powder to
fill your parka when you crash.
</P>
<P>
   No powder? Who am I kidding? Some think it's crazy to ski
without natural snow, when hard-pack, machine-groomed runs are the
rule and diversity the exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to make my day. It's hard to justify for a
2{-hour drive,'' said Pat Murphy of Torrance. ``It gets old after a
few runs on the same terrain. You start looking for something more
challenging, and it's just not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Others care less about diversity, so long as the lifts are
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a saying,'' Jack Stout of Santa Ana said while riding
the Mountain High Express lift. ``If you turn a different direction
at the top of the same run, everything is different on the way
down.''
</P>
<P>
   When the retired engineer took up the recreation in 1952, well
before snowmaking came into play, there wouldn't have been any
Southern California skiing in years like this.
</P>
<P>
   Count yourself lucky ... and for other reasons, too.
</P>
<P>
   While many parts of the country are digging out from winter's
wrath, California is being reminded about drought.
</P>
<P>
   Just last year, El Nino's tepid Pacific waters and warmer air
created more water vapor and moisture content that fed seasonal
storms and intensified precipitation. California took the brunt of
the nation's blizzards and state ski resorts were handsomely
rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   But El Nino's cold-shouldered sister, La Nina, proves the polar
opposite. Ocean temperatures historically dip abnormally low
following an El Nino, and, consequently, California receives
below-normal precipitation.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time, 32 inches of snow had accumulated at
Bear Mountain's base and 57 inches at its summit. This year a
measly 5 to 10 inches has fallen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need snow,'' said Glendale firefighter J.T. Mare of
Wrightwood.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count Mother Nature out just yet. Last year's El Nino
didn't deliver its biggest punch until February, and the greatest
snowfall typically doesn't hit the region's mountains until late
January and February, said Bear Mountain record keeper Bowers.
Remember the ``March miracle'' of 1992, when an entire season was
salvaged by one massive storm?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, not enough is known about La Nina to entirely write off
the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Know this, however, the weather isn't always the best gauge of
ski conditions.

TYSON SHOWS HIS RAW SIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Fixes headline) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Mike Tyson didn't have much to say at the final
press conference before his comeback bout against Francois Botha on
Saturday at the MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
   He did his talking the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed by television reporters Tuesday night, Tyson was at
his disgusting best, spilling an abundant supply of venom in words
that don't belong on TV or in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In a short interview with NBC's Fred Roggin, Tyson was asked
about people who judge him without knowing him. His response was a
profanity-laced tirade.
</P>
<P>
   And that was only one example, during a few minutes' discussion.
He also ended up in a confrontation with a New York anchor _ a
prematurely stopped interview that ended with Tyson cursing the
interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   Roggin, for one, feels sorry for the tormented fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think after all this time, he'd have the presence of
mind to realize he's being interviewed,'' Roggin said. ``He feels
just so beaten down as a person that it just doesn't matter any
more what he says, that his persona is so bad he can't do anything
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at bottom. It can't get any worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, who makes a habit of losing his cool, maintained control
_ as per instructions from his handlers _ at the all-but-useless
and sparsely attended news conference in a huge MGM theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put a muzzle on me,'' Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
   Not soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   Little interest?: The press conference in no way resembled past
Tyson press conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other fights, only a few hundred members of the media
showed up _ if that _ and no fans were seen in or around the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that ticket sales reportedly have been very
slow.
</P>
<P>
   The company you keep: Panama Lewis, Botha's trainer the past
four years, was banned permanently from working the corner in
professional fights after he was convicted of removing the padding
from the gloves of one his boxers before a fight in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   In that bout, now-retired Luis Resto beat the face of Billy
Collins so badly that he had to retire. Collins suffered a torn
iris in his right eye and would have permanent blurred vision.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year later, Collins, broke and depressed, was killed
in a car accident. He was 22.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who has never admitted he played a role in the affair,
and Resto each spent 2{ years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Botha, although sensitive to the tragedy, supports his trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always done what's right with me,'' he said. ``I don't
ask him about history. He paid for what he did. I think it's a
shame. They took everything away from him...
</P>
<P>
   ``(He) still maintains his innocence with me. I can't say
whether he did it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   More cheating: Botha also broke the rules, although his
indiscretion didn't end so tragically.
</P>
<P>
   He defeated Axel Schulz to win the vacant IBF title in 1995 but
his championship was revoked when he tested positive for steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Botha contends he took the drugs only because it was prescribed
for an arm injury.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Tyson reportedly is negotiating to fight Schulz in his
next fight if he beats Botha.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible opponent? Believe it or not, George Foreman.
Promoter Bob Arum, who has rights to Foreman if he meets Tyson, has
made an offer pending the result of Saturday's fight....
</P>
<P>
   Most observers have praised Tyson and his handlers for choosing
Tommy Brooks as the fighter's latest trainer. Lewis prefers Brooks
over Kevin Rooney, who guided Tyson early in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe Tyson was never the same after he split with
Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they hired Rooney, then I'd be worried,'' Lewis said....
</P>
<P>
   Heavyweight Lance Whitaker of Northridge, who faces Alex Stewart
in the biggest fight of his career, could end up with a much bigger
fight before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   America Presents matchmaker Tom Brown said he expects Whitaker
to face Michael Grant if he wins. Whitaker is 6-foot-8, Grant 6-7.

<HEADLINE>
IN RETIREMENT, JORDAN HAS CHANCE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the roaring national debate about who will be the
next Michael Jordan, something occurred to me:
</P>
<P>
   Who was the first Michael Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   I mean, I know the Jordan of the statue and the statistics. I
know the Jordan of the championships and the cheers.
</P>
<P>
   But in this week of national homage-paying to Jordan, I have
read nothing about what Jordan thinks about social issues. I know
nothing about his politics or his faith. I'm not sure I've read
anything substantive from him on the nation's racial divisions.
</P>
<P>
   I know about his preferred underwear, his favorite cartoon
character and his No. 1 cereal. There can't be a life form in the
Milky Way over 5 Earth years who doesn't know his shoe store.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he is the principal subject of nearly 50 books, I'm
not sure I know what he thinks about gun control, even though his
father was killed with a handgun by a petty thug.
</P>
<P>
   Before I'm deluged with letters using the salutation, ``You
Moron!'' and ending with the conclusion that he isn't a politician,
he's an athletic hero, let me point out one thing.
</P>
<P>
   He's not a professional athlete anymore, at least until he earns
his PGA Tour card.
</P>
<P>
   He retired Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he isn't ready to retire from being the most popular,
successful, wealthy and influential athlete in sports history. Now
that basketball is supposedly over, I'd like to know about the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have obligations with endorsements that will require
me to be in the public's forefront for a little while,'' he said.
``I will still be doing commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll still do commercials. Well, thank goodness for that.
Imagine relying on one's own wits intead of his endorsements while
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Jordan has no social consciousness. He began
Wednesday's farewell by poignantly extending his sympathies to a
murdered Chicago policeman, whose funeral inadvertently coincided
with Jordan's news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ``There's a lot of problems out there, there's a
lot of things I can lend my support to, and I will do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly avoided the opportunity to make a specific
commitment to something larger than his corporate persona.
</P>
<P>
   Said Jordan: ``I can't save the world, by no means.''
</P>
<P>
   True, of course, but that's an easy cop-out, taken readily by
nearly every major athlete in the jock world's rise to cultural
pre-eminence over the last 20 years. Usually it's justified _ most
people don't seek out games in order to be proselytized, especially
by often ill-informed athletes (see Reggie White).
</P>
<P>
   But there are rare figures _ Muhammad Ali, Arthur Ashe, Paul
Robeson, Jack Johnson, Jackie Robinson _ who by dint of
achievement, will and racial and social circumstance, are given a
chance to shed light on the darkness that disturbs and compromises
them.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that whatever creates the darkness probably also
benefits some constituency or corporation. That's Jordan's dilemma.
Throughout his professional ascension, he has taken great pains to
offend no one so that he can sell to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   What if he were an activist advocating stiffer gun control laws?
America's most powerful lobby, the National Rifle Association,
would immediately cross off Jordan and his products from their
Christmas lists.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1993 biography, ``Days of Grace,'' Ashe, the late tennis
great, wrote about the conflict of the big-time jock hero:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no radical, but many people in the tennis leadership, as
in other sports, are terrified of taking a stand on political
affairs, or on controversial questions of social justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although certain exceptions come to mind, the prevailing
political ambience of tennis has always been a wealth-oriented
conservatism of the kind associated in this country with staunch
Republicanism and exclusive country clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   That atmosphere pervades all major American sports, which have
come to depend on corporate ownerships and sponsorships and wealthy
fans to sustain the industry's lucrative station. In Jordan, the
handsome, articulate warrior with no sharp edges, the corporations
have the perfect pitchman.
</P>
<P>
   There is little market for the courage of one's convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Today's athletic heroes deem the sacrifice unworthy. The fearful
precedent was set by Muhammad Ali, whose lonely, principled stands
against the Vietnam War and the politics of race cost him seven
years atop his profession and marginalized him with the power
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Jordan's worshipers were not born when the heavyweight
boxing champion withstood the rage of a contemptuous nation that
took decades to vindicate him.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1991 biography by Thomas Hauser, Ali says, ``Standing up
for my religion made me happy; it wasn't a sacrifice. When people
got drafted and sent to Vietnam and didn't understand what the
killing was about and came home with one leg and couldn't get jobs,
that was a sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I believed in what I was doing, so no matter what the
government did to me, it wasn't a loss. I wasn't trying to be a
leader. I just wanted to be free. And I made a stand all people,
not just black people, should have thought about making.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of conviction is almost unimaginable today. The social
activism of the 1960s has almost vanished, replaced by a less noble
urgency: consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   It has been years since baseball was the national pastime,
having been supplanted by television watching. Today, the national
pastime is shopping, and the icons of the age are Jordan and Martha
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's primary benefactor, Nike and its $150 shoes, is the
leader in pointless, excessive consumerism, funded on the backs of
$1-a-day Asian workers. If ever there were a man in position to
tell the truth and right a wrong, it is Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he will. Maybe Jordan is working at it quietly. Maybe
that's how he does his giving, too _ in silence. Honking one's horn
about philanthropy displays a crassness far beneath his works to
date.
</P>
<P>
   But money isn't the point. His time, influence and credibility
are the coins of a potential new realm.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is retired, nothing can change his exalted place in
sports history.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't (ital) have (end ital) to do anything else. I just
wish he would.
</P>
<P>
   His deeds have given him an unprecedented forum to show a Jordan
that no one knows; an enlightened Jordan that risks alienating
some, if not many, of his followers and corporate backers for
rewards that aren't measured in retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   High risk? Sure.
</P>
<P>
   Is there someone more qualified to do a hard job?

DUCKS FALL TO FLAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ As they reached the halfway point of the
1998-99 season Wednesday night the Anaheim Mighty Ducks sunk to new
depths, dropping a 2-1 decision to the lowly Calgary Flames before
a franchise-low 13,542 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of moving a game over .500 with matchups against Dallas,
Pittsburgh and New Jersey looming, the Ducks looked almost
uninterested against a Flames team that was 1-9 in its previous 10
games and 12 games below .500 (13-25-3) coming into Wednesday's
contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't be hard (to get motivated),'' said Ducks winger
Marty McInnis, whose poor dump-in pass led to Jarome Iginla's
winning goal at 8:38 of the third period. ``Any team can beat
anybody in this league. We should be excited and I don't know why
we weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim, which dropped to 16-17-8, lost even though they killed
off a two-minute, two-man advantage, took advantage of their own
two-man advantage, and were on the power play the final two minutes
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game is very important in this league,'' Ducks coach
Craig Hartsburg said. ``Obviously they (the Flames) took the game
more seriously then we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flames could do nothing with their two-man advantage in the
second period, but they got just what they needed midway through
the third period when McInnis' dump-in hit Phil Housley, who
quickly turned the play into a two-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   Iginla scored on a shot from the left circle and goalie Fred
Brathwaite, recently picked up by the Flames off the Canadian
National roster, did the rest, stopping 31 shots in his third start
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Iginla's goal it looked like the Ducks might escape
with at least a point, thanks to a second-period goal by Fredrik
Olausson moments after a two-man advantage had expired.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night the Ducks stole two points from Edmonton when they
scored three times on two-man advantages, but by Wednesday their
luck had run out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we get too comfortable at home,'' said Hartsburg of the
Ducks, who are in the midst of a season-long seven-game homestand.
``It (the loss) had to do with our start and preparation. We have
to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep getting behind by a goal and relying on our power
play, penalty killing and goaltending,'' said McInnis. ``We can't
keep doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again the Ducks struggled at even strength, their only goal
coming at 9:10 on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   Brathwaite denied Teemu Selanne on three consecutive shots while
the Ducks had a one-man advantage and Anaheim nearly squandered a
49-second two-man advantage before Olausson one-timed Paul Kariya's
pass over the glove of the Calgary goalie just two seconds after
Iginla left the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Paul Devorski evened the score and then some at 13:04 of
the period when he sent Selanne and Kevin Haller to the penalty
box, giving the Flames a full two-minute two-man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary, however, was unable to regain the lead as Guy Hebert
stopped all five shots the Flames put on net.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames have yet to score a power-play goal in 1999 _ their
last came on Dec. 29, 1998 _ but Jason Wiemer's first-period goal
at 10:40 was just as good.
</P>
<P>
   Wiemer deflected Housley's shot from the right point over the
shoulder of Hebert just one second after a interference penalty to
Ruslan Salei had expired.

THE END OF AN AURA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's special All-Air edition of The Sporting Muse:
</P>
<P>
   We are awash today in the kind of sentiment and emotion that is
usually reserved for important people who have taken that final
off-ramp. And while it's understandable, it's also a little creepy.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, Michael Jordan is not dead. His Airness will be as
visible as ever. He'll make his long distance phone commercials
with his Looney Toon friends, and maybe that long-awaited sequel to
``Space Jam.'' Nike will produce a dozen new versions of Air
Jordans. The Air Fairway is long overdue. How about walking shoes?
Or maybe Jordan Outdoor Gear with patented Airsole cushioning?
</P>
<P>
   I envision Jordan making the cut of every 1999 PGA Pro-Am. He's
already committed to play the Bob Hope Classic, coming to a desert
near you.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan will become that celebrity-in-the-audience standard
bearer on SportsCenter, whether he's in the stands at the
Duke-North Carolina game eating popcorn with his kids or watching
the Three Tenors raise the roof of some opera house.
</P>
<P>
   He just won't be holding a basketball when you see him. And even
there, the man left enough room in his retirement for the
occasional peak and clutch of the rosary beads. He said he was 99.9
percent retired. Asked why he didn't say he was 100 percent
retired, Jordan shot back ``because it's my one percent, not
yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'm just happy he's happy with his decision. If this
had become a forced exit from the Bulls because of The Jerky
Jerrys, Reinsdorf and Krause, the whole thing would have been
distressing.
</P>
<P>
   I never imagined Jordan staying too long and lapsing into
Muhammad Ali territory, which is why I took his threats to retire
last season seriously. He's said it's time, and there's no one
better qualified to know that. ...
</P>
<P>
   File this in the Everything-I-know-I-learned-from-sports-
</P>
<P>
   talk-radio file:
</P>
<P>
   A local sports talkee said with straight lips Wednesday that
Jordan did not change the game of basketball as centers Wilt
Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did. It's comments like this
that convince me that road rage is caused by sports talk radio.
</P>
<P>
   All Jordan did was lift the game into the atmosphere at a time
when it was edging toward human gridlock. As the Magic Johnson and
Larry Bird era came to an end, replaced by thugs like the Pistons,
Knicks and others without grace, Jordan restored the game's
aesthetic by going vertical.
</P>
<P>
   An entire generation has followed Jordan's lead into the air and
out of the way of the bodies. Jordan showed that the power of the
dunk did not have to be the private reserve of seven-footers, that
it was easier to go over the big uglies in the paint than through
them.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what basketball would have looked like the last three
years if Jordan hadn't returned from his baseball fantasy camp. ...
</P>
<P>
   There is one area of Jordan's domain that I consider overrated.
</P>
<P>
   When the Boston Celtics ran off 11 NBA titles in 13 years, they
did so against a smaller, tougher league. They dominated
Chamberlain in several cities, the Jerry West-Elgin Baylor Lakers
and good St. Louis Hawks teams.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Celtics-Lakers decade of dominance in the '80s
proved to be the best, most competitive basketball anyone has ever
seen. Those wars were classics, to the degree that watching replays
on ESPN Classic Sports is preferable to watching a live NBA game.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan dominated a league that expanded too quickly. What passes
for talent these days has been diluted to the degree that several
teams do not have what one would call a franchise player.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the teams Jordan beat will never go down in history as
anything more than pylons. The Lakers' Showtime was winding down in
1991 when Jordan won his first of six titles. The next five came
against Portland, Phoenix, Seattle and Utah twice. I may be willing
to move off this point regarding the Jazz, but only if Karl Malone
promises to retire from sports talk. ...
</P>
<P>
   Jordan carried a league on his back. When you look at the 29 NBA
rosters, you can't find a dozen guys capable of carrying their
team, much less a league.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's big marketing problem is isolating heroes. It's hard
to find anyone to hang a campaign on. Here's how the masses shake
out, by category:
</P>
<P>
   Teams with aging stars
</P>
<P>
   (4): Houston (Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley are crowding
36), Seattle (three starters over 30), Utah (Malone is 35, John
Stockton 37) and Washington (flush with thirtysomethings).
</P>
<P>
   One-player teams
</P>
<P>
   (2): Detroit (Grant Hill), Charlotte (Glen Rice).
</P>
<P>
   Teams with stars who have yet to earn their pay
</P>
<P>
   (5): Cleveland (Shawn Kemp), Milwaukee (Glenn ``Just Dog''
Robinson), Minnesota (Kevin Garnett), Orlando (Penny Hardaway) and
Phoenix (Antonio McDyess).
</P>
<P>
   Teams with infant stars
</P>
<P>
   (2): Boston (Paul Pierce, Antoine Walker, Ron Mercer) and New
Jersey (Keith Van Horn).
</P>
<P>
   Teams without stars
</P>
<P>
   (8): Chicago (assuming Scottie Pippen leaves), Dallas, Denver,
Golden State, Clippers, Portland, Toronto and Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Teams who play thug ball
</P>
<P>
   , (2): Miami and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Teams with reprobates
</P>
<P>
   (2 or more): Philadelphia (Allen Iverson), Sacramento (Chris
Webber) and whoever signs Latrell Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   That accounts for all but four of the league's 29 teams. The
leftovers are the Pacers, the Lakers, the Spurs and the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be the least bit surprising to see Indiana win a
title on the strength of Larry Bird's efficient coaching. Besides
the Pacers, the only teams in the east that look the slightest bit
interesting are Atlanta (with stars Steve Smith, Dikembe Mutombo
and Mookie Blaylock), Minnesota and Rick Pitino's Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, with Shaq and Kobe, and Spurs, with an Old Tower
(David Robinson) and a New Tower (Tim Duncan) are clear contenders.
But there's more depth in the west, too. Houston and Utah figure to
have a say in who qualifies for the finals. ...
</P>
<P>
   Rumor du jour: Jordan will take a year off, let his cut finger
heal, and then become part of an ownership group that will buy a
NBA franchise. Phil Jackson will coach, and Jordan will play at
least two seasons to give it the launch it needs. ...

FORD LIKES A CHALLENGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On his first day in Tinseltown, Chris Ford
discussed casting strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of an underdog is not bad,'' said the former coach of
the Boston Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   As the new coach of the Clippers, some NBA observers might say
Ford has been handed the lead in the Iditarod.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem to forget that this team was in the playoffs two
years ago,'' Ford pointed out during Wednesday's getting-acquainted
press conference at the Convention Center. ``This could be an
exciting time.''
</P>
<P>
   What people seem to remember is that last year's Clippers won
only 17 of 82 games, inspiring management to fire veteran bench
boss Bill Fitch, who coached in Boston when Ford was a Celtic. But
Clippers history doesn't seem to bother Ford, a 50-year-old NBA
lifer whose motivation includes a three-year deal for slightly less
than $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the hand I've been dealt,'' he said. ``I think it's a
great opportunity. Our objective is to become a winning team in the
playoffs and go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   To help meet that objective, the Clippers have about $3.7
million to shop with in the free-agent market. The NBA's shelves
are jammed with unemployed playmakers, including Darrick Martin, a
free agent who ran the show for the Clippers most of last season.
But the team's abundance of young forwards could make trading an
option.
</P>
<P>
   Center would be next on the list of Clippers concerns. If rookie
Michael Olowokandi, the top pick in last year's draft, returns
healthy and happy after his month-long tour of Italy, Ford will
need just one more component for a smooth beginning:
</P>
<P>
   A commitment from his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to be better,'' said Ford, ``they have to pay the
price. The players have a clean slate now. If they're ready to
work, there won't be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Clipper capable of mustering a perspective on life with
Ford is center Stojko Vrankovic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tough and he's a hard worker,'' said Vrankovic, who was a
Celtic during Ford's first two seasons as the Boston coach. ``We
have a young team; I think he's going to help the young guys a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard James Robinson said having a tough coach is just dandy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys need a coach like Chris Ford,'' Robinson said.
``Everybody's got to have an open mind; it's his team.''
</P>
<P>
   For several weeks, popular speculation had the Clippers close to
becoming Jim Brewer's team. Brewer, Fitch's assistant the past four
seasons, finished second to Ford in the replacing-Fitch derby, but
has been rehired as the Clippers' lead assistant. Jim Todd, an
assistant to Ford the past two seasons in Milwaukee, will fill the
same role here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be nice to have his insight,'' said Ford of Brewer,
whose familiarity with the players should make for a smoother
transition. ``I know it's a tough situation for him. I'll do
whatever I can to promote him in regard to getting a head-coaching
job in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer handled the disappointment with characteristic class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel OK, I feel good about it,'' he said. ``I think about
the positives. To be considered for a head-coaching job is quite an
accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Another objective would be reaching those playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a guy who loves the game,'' said Ford. ``I know what it
takes to win. As I get older, I get wiser as well.''
</P>
<P>
   And if that wisdom can be translated into Tinseltown success,
Chris Ford may not age as quickly as other Clippers coaches.

PARANOID ABOUT A GOOD MARRIAGE 
 FOR USE FRI., JAN. 14, OR ANYTIME THEREAFTER.
</HEADLINE>
  By DR. JOY BROWNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Joy: I am happily married for 22 years to a good man and
want to preserve our union. I am having attacks of ``paranoia,'' as
I am witnessing so many couples divorcing after decades of
marriage! I foresee the two of us heading for some stressful events
as my husband is starting a second career, our 20-year-old daughter
is trying to find herself, a major relocation is coming and I will
have to find a new teaching job wherever we move. Please help us
who are feeling successful in our marriages, and want to keep them
on that track. _ MARY and still MARRIED (via e-mail)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joy: Mary, never look for problems where none exist. I know
you feel you're planning ahead, but in using other people's
difficulties for potential sources of stress you are missing your
own resources as a source of strength in your relationship.
Presumably you two communicate well, you have a good sex life and
take pleasure in the parenting of your child.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that you are going through a painful transition. Your
daughter is growing older and becoming more independent, which is
natural but also difficult to accept. (It used to be called the
``empty nest syndrome,'' but don't worry, it will likely become the
``crowded nest syndrome'' if your kid decides to try rent-free
living again.) The intended move to another city is obviously
disrupting your particular career path, while your husband is
perhaps diverting time from you to invest in his career change.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately these changes may coalesce into the old joke about
the guy trading in his 40-year-old wife for two 20-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than focus on unrealistic fears, figure out what is
really bothering you; focus on your strengths and solve one
specific problem at a time. Relax and don't panic.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Joy: I am 26 years old. I have been involved with a
wonderful man, age 23, for the past three years. I love him lot and
he loves me, but lately I feel like I am on the back burner.
</P>
<P>
   He really enjoys coaching a youth hockey team because it gives
him a feeling of giving back to the community. To me, though, it
seems that hockey comes first. I have this feeling of hatred for
those kids and I know that is not healthy.
</P>
<P>
   How do I bring back the passion back into the relationship
without pressuring him? _ S.K., Eugene, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joy: Sally, beating up on small children on skates is not an
option, so let's figure out what is really going on here. The issue
isn't the kids, it's the passion in your relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The two of you are young; your boyfriend especially. Women, as
I'm sure you're aware, mature socially much more readily then men.
When you met him he was only 20, which, let's face it, is when all
of us are a little runny.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like he is a good guy and he is growing up. But even
mature men and women view relationship-time very differently. Most
women would name a man their first priority, family as second and
work as third; men on the other hand would name work as first,
their friends quite often as second and themselves as third. Which
leaves the woman fourth. It's not that he doesn't love you, but
that discrepancy can haunt your relationship if you're not very
careful.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time to take a step back to decide if this is really
the guy you want. Take three to six months off without seeing each
other and see what happens. If that idea is making your stomach
hurt, figure out something to take care of your free time and
schedule a limited time with your hockey coach. It may be that the
things you do on your own will be so rewarding that you resent his
activities a little less.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Joy: I am the mother of a 45-year-old divorced
daughter. She has raised her two children now 19 and 17. Five years
ago she announced she was gay. At that time the children were in
their early teens. Until two years ago she was very discreet about
her behavior. At that time she took on a new partner who moved in
with her and took over. The children moved in with their father.
</P>
<P>
   I have two very unhappy grandchildren and a daughter who will
not admit she had anything to do with their unhappiness. As far as
she is concerned, she has done nothing wrong. We are unable to see
her without her new partner nor will she see her children without
her.
</P>
<P>
   I love my daughter dearly, but cannot approve of what she has
done to our family. Her choice of lifestyle is not the biggest
problem, it is her indiscretion and lack of responsibility which is
troubling all of us. What can we do? _ Straight Mother in Florida
(via e-mail)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joy: Oh dear Straight Mother--you are on thin ice. It's
always difficult when our children don't meet our expectations;
sometimes these expectations have to do with our unrealized wishes
and dreams. My argument with your daughter is the same as yours,
not that she's gay but that she would move a partner in, man or
woman, to have a sexual relationship while living with late
adolescent teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   My rule is, when you have a new partner and also have young
children around, either marry the partner or live apart--take the
sex part out of it. Now, realistically, it may be that your
daughter and her partner in fact view themselves as married. A
ceremony of some sort may solidify this fact for the couple and for
the children. If your daughter had found a male lover and married
him, there would be the normal adjustment problems for the ``dad''
but everyone would view them as acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   You might say to your daughter, ``Do you feel close enough to
this person to go through some kind of ceremony?'' And if she says
yes then maybe the family can get together and, if not approve, at
least stop being disdainful of the union.

DICK WILLIAMS REMEMBERS SPECIAL BREED OF FORT WORTH CATS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late on a September evening in 1949, a thoroughly dejected
outfielder with the Fort Worth Cats delivered a brief postgame
oration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you lead off an inning with a triple, and then can't
get the run in, it's time to quit,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   That was indeed the fate of the Cats, who had just lost the
Texas League championship to the Tulsa Oilers, partly because of
the inability to score that 10th-inning run.
</P>
<P>
   But for center fielder Dick Williams, it was early in a baseball
career that is still running. That career could culminate with
induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame this summer after the
veterans committee votes in March.
</P>
<P>
   Now a special scout with the New York Yankees, Williams will
return to the scene of old memories this week as the guest speaker
at Texas Wesleyan's annual baseball banquet on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And at a distance of nearly a half-century, he says he still
agrees with that kid in the Cats' uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always believed that,'' he said. ``You do what you have
to do to win, or you pack it in. No excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps the prevailing image of Williams, whose combative,
no-nonsense approach to winning enabled him to become only the
second manager in major-league history to reach the World Series
with three different franchises.
</P>
<P>
   He stamped himself forever with the 1967 ``Miracle at Fenway''
when, as a rookie manager, he guided the formerly ninth-place
Boston Red Sox to the American League pennant. They then took the
World Series to seven games before losing to the St. Louis
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972-73, he won back-to-back world championships for Charley
Finley at Oakland, then resigned after a dispute with the owner.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, he joined Bill McKechnie (1925 Pirates, 1928 Cardinals,
1939-40 Reds) as the only manager to win pennants at three
franchises by guiding San Diego to the National League crown.
</P>
<P>
   Williams spent three early years (1948-50) of his career playing
for Bobby Bragan's Cats, before being called up to the majors like
most of the talented Brooklyn farm hands who were his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, 1949 was a special year. Bulging with 15 former
or future major-leaguers, the Cats led the league in almost every
statistical category, and won the regular-season pennant with a
10-game margin over second-place Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the talents of Williams, Cal Abrams, Chico Carrasquel,
Preston Ward, Dee Fondy, Carl Erskine, Turk Lown and Billy Loes,
the Cats launched themselves out of twin disasters to win the
pennant handily.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-June, a mysterious fire burned most of LaGrave Field, an
event quickly followed by the great '49 flood, which inundated much
of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no home,'' Williams said, ``and we had to go on the
road for something like 23 days. I think we won all but about one
game in that stretch, and by the time they got LaGrave back to
where we could play in it, we were in first place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cats closed with 16 wins in their last 17 games, flattening
Shreveport in five games in the opening round of the playoffs, and
scoring 24 runs in two wins against the Oilers. Then the bats went
cold, and a 1-0 pitching gem was required to even the series at
three games apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The victor in that game was Eddie Chandler, an innovative
performer who once bit a Tulsa player in a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was also the only ballplayer I ever knew who owned a dump
truck,'' Williams said, laughing. ``He used to supplement his
salary by hauling trash. In fact, I think he owned two or three
trucks by the time he left Fort Worth.''
</P>
<P>
   The seventh game of the series was tied, 1-1, when Williams led
off the bottom of the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a ball into the right-field corner for a triple,'' he
said, ``and we actually could have won the game, because the relay
got past the third baseman, and almost went into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had, I would have automatically gone home with the
winning run. But it hit the railing and bounced back.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tulsa loaded the bases with intentional walks and got two
ground balls to end the inning, and, in the 11th, Joe Adcock hit a
three-run home run off Joe Landrum. For the Cats, a glittering
season turned sour.
</P>
<P>
   But the season wasn't a total loss for Williams. He hit .309,
led the team in home runs (23) and runs batted in (114) . . . and
met Norma Musatto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landrum and I were rooming together in a house out in the
Polytechnic area,'' Williams said, ``and a guy named R.B. Dill
delivered Vandervoort's milk on that route.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day he came around and told us about these two sisters _
Gina and Norma _ that he thought we should get to know. The guy we
rented from had an old 1931 car he let us use, so Joe and I started
dating them. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, Gina was Miss Fort Worth
in '49.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Norma became Mrs. Dick Williams. They have
three children _ Kathi, Marc and Rick, who is a pitching coach with
Tampa Bay _ and will celebrate their 45th anniversary in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing thing,'' Williams said. ``I don't know how she
put up with me all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' promising playing career was cut short when he crashed
into an outfield wall and injured his right shoulder. What had been
a strong throwing arm was never the same, and he spent most of 13
seasons as a utility player. Time on the bench, however, was
useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I sat,'' he said, ``the more I learned.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was a process that began early, as a Brooklyn farm hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked up a lot from Bobby Bragan,'' he said. ``He was a
Branch Rickey man through and through, and it sometimes seemed like
he was my dad and Mr. Rickey was my grandfather _ or maybe the
Pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an audience with him once, asking for a raise. He
reminded me that I was still in the minor leagues, and that wasn't
where you made your money.''
</P>
<P>
   As chronicled in his 1990 book, /No More Mr. Nice Guy'', his
managerial career was both stormy and successful.
</P>
<P>
   He is proud of the '67 Red Sox, whose journey to the seventh
game of the series was one of baseball's truly amazing feats. He is
fond of the two World Champions he had at Oakland _ and even of the
owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly didn't agree with everything he did,'' Williams
said, ``but Charley knew baseball, and he was actually fun to work
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he always said that his middle initial /RO./S stood for
`Owner,' and I count it as an accomplishment that unlike some
others, I lasted more than one year.''

RECOVERY OF A LIFETIME: TEXAS SOCCER PLAYER MAKES LONG JOURNEY
BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY PHILLIPS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROWLEY, Texas _ Athletes come back from various injuries all
the time. Crowley High School soccer player Kyle Rodeheaver did it
one better.
</P>
<P>
   He cheated death.
</P>
<P>
   Rodeheaver's miracle story ended with him returning to the
soccer field, firing shots and scoring goals. He did all this only
eight months after lapsing into a nine-day coma at a Colorado
hospital on June 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to his doctors, eight other people who experienced
Rodeheaver's rare disorder, known as subdural empyema, weren't as
lucky. All eight died.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Rodeheaver plays soccer at the school just south of Fort
Worth with a two-inch diameter plexiglass plate melded into the
left side of his skull. The plate protects a portion of
Rodeheaver's brain that became so infected it induced a coma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right before we went to a soccer tournament in Colorado, I was
having real bad headaches,'' Rodeheaver said. ``They thought it was
migraines.''
</P>
<P>
   Side effects from Rodeheaver's headache medication caused him to
miss the first game of the trip. Later that night, he went into
convulsions. In the ambulance en route to the hospital, he slipped
into a coma.
</P>
<P>
   After a massive brain abscess was found, it took doctors 10
hours to remove a section of Rodeheaver's skull. Tubes designed to
drain the empyema, or pus buildup, were attached to Rodeheaver's
brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a huge clump in one spot that was pushing on my
brain and causing the headaches,'' Rodeheaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodeheaver awoke on July 4, 1996, to the sound of fireworks and
other surprises. His shaved head had an inverted L-shaped scar over
his left ear. He dropped to 99 pounds _ about a 40-pound loss,
Crowley soccer coach Derek Vierling said.
</P>
<P>
   For six months, Rodeheaver would have a section of his brain
covered only by a layer of skin until the plexiglass plate was
implanted on Jan. 3, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Family and teammates who prayed over him had feared the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw him, it was bad,'' said teammate William
Wallace, who helped Rodeheaver's parents by watching over his two
younger brothers. ``We'd get together and pray every night. I was
scared I'd never see him again.''
</P>
<P>
   The cause of Rodeheaver's condition was traced to a pool party
earlier that summer. During a game of water volleyball, he broke
his nose. The resulting deviated septum forced fluid to back up
into Rodeheaver's brain.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor on duty in Colorado was the first to diagnose subdural
empyema.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what Kyle's dad said, it was a one-in-a-million chance
that this doctor happened to work in Colorado,'' Vierling said.
``Had it happened down here, it would have been diagnosed as a
migraine, and his brain might have exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 8, 1996, a little more than a month after waking from
the coma, Rodeheaver was released from the hospital. At 107 pounds,
he was in class on the first day of school.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors disagreed on Rodeheaver's prognosis. Some predicted a
life of physical inactivity and limited walking ability.
Rodeheaver's neurosurgeon encouraged him to return to soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``After his \Rfirst\S surgery, I didn't think he was going to
survive,'' said Dan Rodeheaver, Kyle's father. ``After he woke up,
he went from not being able to walk to running and doing lots of
things. It was a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, with antibiotics flowing into one arm from an IV
hip bag, Rodeheaver began light running.
</P>
<P>
   He was cleared to play soccer on his birthday, Feb. 15, a month
after his second surgery. Reluctantly, Vierling played him for one
week on the junior-varsity team and in the last four varsity games
after repeated assurances from Rodeheaver's parents and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's up here running miles and lifting weights,'' Vierling
said. ``I was petrified to see him doing anything. I was afraid
he'd die if he tripped and fell.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, a third surgery corrected Rodeheaver's deviated
septum. As a junior, he had eight goals and 13 assists in the '98
high school season and also returned to club soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was big-time motivation for everybody,'' Vierling said. ``I
refer to it all the time. When everyone's loafing, I mention that
not too long ago, Kyle was running around half-dead out here
because he wanted to play so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Affectionately dubbed, ``Cement Head'' by his teammates,
Rodeheaver said the little things in life aren't so little anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``You figure your friends and family will always be there,'' he
said. ``But one day, maybe they won't or you won't. And you don't
know how much it'll affect you until it happens.''

HIGH SCHOOL PLAYER REBOUNDS FROM HEART AILMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ When Clyde Williams took the court for Texas
Christian Academy's second-round game at the Lake Country boys high
school basketball tournament last month, it had to have been a
dramatic moment.
</P>
<P>
   To him, it was nothing special. He always knew he'd be back.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 21 points against Lake Country on Dec. 11 in his first
athletic competition since leaving the football team in midseason
because of an irregular heartbeat. The next day, he scored 11 in
the championship game against Canyon Creek.
</P>
<P>
   In all, he had missed about eight weeks while he waited for his
new medication to take effect.
</P>
<P>
   But it was like he never left.
</P>
<P>
   Cleared for competition last month, he has since helped Texas
Christian win the Oakridge Classic and start 16-6. A recent slide
has the Spartans (16-8) at 1-2 in TAPPS District 3-3A, but they get
a chance to even that record at 7:30 p.m. tomorrow when they host
Southwest Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Count on Williams, a 5-foot-10 junior guard, being there. He
isn't going anywhere the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missing football and basketball, it was horrible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To stay on the court, Williams simply needs to take his medicine
daily. And he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't let it stop him from anything,'' said his mother,
Becky Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, if it hadn't been for a somewhat lucky physical when Clyde
was 12, no one _ least of all Clyde _ might have noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really shocked to hear that,'' Mrs. Carroll said.
``We'd always gone to the same doctor for a checkup every year
regardless, and the doctor was just shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Have I ever told you Clyde has an irregular
heartbeat?' I said, `No.' We asked Clyde, and he said he'd never
noticed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' heartbeat is actually normal during high activity such
as a basketball game or a treadmill workout, Mrs. Carroll said. But
at rest, it occasionally speeds up quickly, then slows again.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he doesn't even notice when it happens, but on
that particular day that he went in for a physical as a
12-year-old, the doctor had his stethoscope in the right place at
the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Cardiograms and medication followed, and two years ago, surgery
was performed. He was taken out of sports in October because a
yearly test indicated a possible new problem. New medication was
prescribed, and after two months, another test gave good signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just knew he was going to play,'' Mrs. Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has corrected the condition, but the daily medication is
helping.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll have to take it for awhile. It won't be a lifetime
thing,'' Mrs. Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Stepfather Mike Carroll said: ``He does have to be disciplined
about it. He has to take it twice a day, once in the morning and
once in the evening. ... He feels real good. He always tells us how
he feels. He doesn't have any problems. He doesn't have any pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Christian coach Tony Lehew probably wasn't surprised to
have Williams back. Williams had wanted to practice with the team
even while he was supposed to be sitting out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't miss a practice. He shot around, ran light drills,
but he couldn't get too involved,'' Lehew said. ``He really wanted
to stay at practice and be sure of what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has a love for sports _ he says he's a pretty good
soccer player, too _ and can see himself playing after high school.
But for now, there's the matter of getting the Spartans back on
track.
</P>
<P>
   His heart appears to be.

 &HT;    DREAMSVILLE: A man on a train
 &HT;    (A photo of Lee Hill-Nelson at age 12 is available by calling
CoxNet, the Cox News Service, at 404-526-5456.)
 &HT;    By Lee Hill-Nelson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (''Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in which readers share
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   In the evenings I watched for the Doodlebug train. From way down
the tracks I would hear a whistle blow, and in the opened door a
man, dressed in a black uniform, stood and waved a rolled-up
newspaper. He'd throw it just as the train passed in front of our
house.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, our family moved from the Bridle Bit Community to
the Buffalo Flat Community, both near Turkey, Texas. The move and
the kindness of the railroad man changed my life.
</P>
<P>
   Every day at noontime, out of the west came a small black train
we called the Doodlebug. The train's engine pulled a passenger car,
dining car and baggage car. In the evenings the train came back,
and a pattern was set for me for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The train whistle blew, the conductor threw a day-old Fort Worth
Telegram or a Denver Post, depending on where the train was coming
from, and I ran to the train tracks to get the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   And then, adventures began with Little Orphan Annie (a bug-eyed
orphan with a big dog), Mary Worth (a woman who did good deeds for
others), Dick Tracy (law and order detective) and others in the
comics.
</P>
<P>
   As time passed, I stared at the dressed-up people on the train
and imagined wonderful stories about them; happy people, traveling
to faraway places, maybe they were rich.
</P>
<P>
   The train station was about a city block from our house. One day
my big moment came. The Doodlebug stopped for repairs. The man in
the black uniform got off the train, waved a newspaper and motioned
for me to come down the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, my name's Tom Huggins,'' he said as he reached to shake
my hand. I stared at him, knowing I was supposed to say something
but not knowing what.
</P>
<P>
   No sounds came out of my mouth. I looked down and saw my dirty
bare feet. I hoped he didn't notice them. Without a word I took the
newspaper and ran home.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, the newspapers continued to teach me about life
in a bigger world, and I dreamed of some day living in a city like
Denver or Fort Worth. The newspapers gave me a resource for
subjects such as history, speech and government classes.
</P>
<P>
   Through World War II, stories of patriotism and the horrors of
war came to our farm through the newspapers the man on the train
gave us.
</P>
<P>
   And then one day I went away. I went to Dallas to work. When I
came home to visit, I rode the Doodlebug from Childress to Turkey,
and it was Mr. Huggins who collected the tickets. I told him who I
was and where I was going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad you are riding the train,'' he said. ``I've thrown
you newspapers for years.'' I knew I was in the company of an old
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Dusk had settled in when the train reached our house. I could
see Mama on the front porch.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Huggins waved a newspaper in one hand and a flashlight in
the other. He'd written on the newspaper this message:
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet your daughter at the train station. She's coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   That was my only trip on the Doodlebug.
</P>
<P>
   The little train is no more. Folks just quit riding it.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Mr. Huggins, wherever you may be. Because you cared
and took time to give away your day-old newspapers, you enriched a
young girl's life.

HORMEL'S RENOMINATION FOR EMBASSY JOB FACES UNCERTAIN FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A leading Republican senator says the renomination
of San Francisco gay rights activist James C. Hormel to be U.S.
ambassador to Luxembourg faces an uncertain fate in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee and a Hormel supporter, said Wednesday that the San
Francisco philanthropist is ``certainly well qualified'' for the
post but said he wouldn't predict the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what will happen. We'll just have to wait and
see,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, also said the outlook was
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell where the votes are,'' said Hutchison.
``There hasn't been any kind of a head count.''
</P>
<P>
   Several senior Republican senators pledged their support for
Hormel, whose nomination died last Congress because conservative
senators blocked a floor vote. The White House and gay rights
groups insisted that Hormel had enough support among senators to
win confirmation if such a vote were allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The floor vote was blocked by Sens. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla.,
Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., and Robert C. Smith, R-N.H., using a
parliamentary maneuver known as a ``hold'' that allows a senator to
stop a piece of legislation from coming before the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel's opponents said his activism on behalf of homosexual
rights would make him an inappropriate choice to serve as envoy to
a Catholic country.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, 66, is heir to a meat-processing fortune and a former
dean of the University of Chicago Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, said he has always believed that a
president should be entitled to make ambassadorial nominations and
should get a Senate vote on his candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he comes up for a vote, I'd vote for him,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also voiced his support for Hormel.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., a leading Senate liberal and
outspoken supporter of Hormel, said he was prepared to use
parliamentary tactics to tie up the Senate in order to bring
Hormel's nomination to an up-or-down floor vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless Jim Hormel gets a vote, we'll have an impasse on the
floor,'' Wellstone said.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative religious groups, including the Traditional Values
Coalition, have fought the nomination, providing senators with
photo-copies of sexually explicit material from a section of the
San Francisco Public Library named after and funded by Hormel.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, headed by conservative
Senator Jesse A. Helms, R-N.C., voted in November 1997 to recommend
that Hormel's nomination be approved.
</P>
<P>
   Because this is a new Congress, the committee will have to vote
again on the nomination.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Hellbent House meets sober Senate
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Senate at least has brought some decorum and orderliness to
the profligate drive to throw Bill Clinton out of the presidency.
Whether those qualities can endure will remain an open question
until the final gavel, but for these early days of the trial, the
bipartisan compromise on procedures and the unanimous vote for it
stand as moments of political elegance in a time that has seen few
of those.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the Senate in the long run is the unholy mess
that the hellbent House has sent over as a supposed impeachment
case. If this were a real trial, with real jurors in a real court
with a real judge, the House's articles would be thrown out faster
than a gutter drunk at the Ritz bar.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening exchange of briefs, the president's lawyers
easily had the better of their argument with the House's
impeachment managers. Just as the White House complains, the two
articles of impeachment are cast in generalities, not specifics.
That lets the managers keep moving the target; the president's
alleged perjuries and obstructions of justice are only what the
managers say they are at any given moment.
</P>
<P>
   This matter has reached its most sober moment, but the
get-Clinton gang continues to act as it has all along, simply
shifting the issue when one of its charges fails to pan out.
Remember last year when it was said the president's fate hung on
the ``talking points''? When it turned out Monica Lewinsky had
written them herself, the president's fate, like an old coat, was
just moved to another peg.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, although the House pointedly rejected an impeachment
article based on Clinton's deposition in the Paula Jones case, the
House prosecutors are trying to bootleg that testimony back into
play under cover of the obstruction article.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the House's representatives hesitant to improvise
entirely new games. The House Judiciary Committee Republicans
called no witnesses, relying entirely for their case on the
obviously slanted reading by prosecutor Kenneth Starr of testimony
and other evidence that the defense had had no chance to test
through cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   Now the managers insist they must call the witnesses cited in
Starr's referral for Senate testimony _ win or lose then, the
process would be dragged out, to the president's further and
gratuitous embarrassment. More, they have indicated they want to
add new issues and new witnesses, particularly concerning Kathleen
Willey's muddled claim that Clinton tried to fondle her.
</P>
<P>
   (In which ploy they have been, as ever, monumentally aided by
Starr, who has charged the witness who cast doubt on Willey's
account with perjury. It'll be months before that is settled, but
meantime Clinton has been denied a rebuttal witness. Starr says
that's coincidence. You are free to think so if you wish.)
</P>
<P>
   The House's impeachment managers are, in effect, simply making
up their prosecution as they go along and daring the president to
keep up. The poor Senate is hearing a case that would be more at
home in the courtroom of the Red Queen in Alice's Wonderland.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Oh, do I have a baseball for you...!
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Jan. 17, 1999.
 &HT;    (EDS: Last night in 6th graf refers to this Saturday night.)
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am grappling with myself over the purchase of Mark McGwire's
70th home run ball for $3 million. Did the buyer, whomever he is,
get a good deal?
</P>
<P>
   At first, you only sense the outrageousness of anyone paying
that kind of money for a baseball _ a damaged one at that; bam,
McGwire blasted it out of the park, must be a dent there somewhere.
But someone actually paid $640,000 for a Honus Wagner baseball card
in 1996 and it's only a tiny piece of paper!
</P>
<P>
   For a while I doodled about what I could buy with $3 million
instead of a baseball. Well, a baseball manufacturing plant, for
one. Also, three cruise missiles to fling at mud huts in Iraq. Or
about three miles of interstate. Or the next five Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   And then it hit me: I could hardly buy a weak-hitting second
baseman for that!
</P>
<P>
   Everything is relative. There is a plane over which some people
levitate where expenditures are not determined in hundreds or
thousands of dollars but in millions. Most of us cannot relate to
that.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, millions of dollars were spent on pay-per-view to
watch ear-biting, foul-mouthed rapist Mike Tyson battle with
someone named Botha. I don't know how much Tyson earned for that
one, but he got somewhere around $30 million for the fight in which
he dined on Evander Holyfield's ear. One fight. Thirty million!
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade ago, a Japanese consortium paid more than $80
million for a painting by Vincent Van Gogh. That drastically raised
the price of paintings by the masters, even took it out of the
reach of the average millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Movie stars won't step on the set for less than a couple of
million, and professional basketball players _ well, that's another
story. People are spending $25 a pop to smoke a cigar, corporations
pay a thousand or so dollars over face value to buy tickets to the
Super Bowl, then rent jets to fly them there.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, everyone moans and groans when Ted Kennedy suggests
we raise the nation's minimum wage, as if any of us will be able to
buy Mark McGwire's 70th or Diana's wedding gown with it.
</P>
<P>
   How do I get in on this great deal of American Extravagance?
</P>
<P>
   A start: I have this baseball, and it is a rarity. I bought it
for $5 in 1988 at a West Palm Beach spring training game between
the Atlanta Braves and Montreal Expos. Then I had it signed by
Buddy Biancalana while he wore a Braves uniform. (He earlier had
played for Kansas City and Houston and had a total lifetime home
run record of six.)
</P>
<P>
   What makes the ball so unique is that few recall Buddy, and
also, he never played a regular-season game for the Braves. He was
cut from the squad several hours after he signed the baseball for
my then 6-year-old grandson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that,'' I hustled my grandson, ``Buddy Biancalana
signed the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been expecting Dale Murphy or Phil Niekro. He got Buddy.
``Who's Buddy Brancicollar?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy was no slouch, I told him _ unaware that the Turk was
waiting for Buddy to get back into the clubhouse. In earlier
seasons, he'd bat .194, up to .242. By today's cornucopian salary
standards, he probably could earn 2 or 3 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Understand that Buddy signed the ball. Mark McGwire did not sign
the ball that went for $3 million. He's signed hundreds of other
baseballs but not that one. Buddy, however, signed mine and mine
isn't dented by the blow of a bat. I bought it at the concession
stand. It's in mint condition.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy was cut that day and I have the very last baseball he ever
signed in a major-league uniform. How many have such a Buddy
Biancalana-signed mint-condition ball? It's a rarity, I tell you.
</P>
<P>
   How about it out there? What do I hear from you opulent
collectors?
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: WHERE WILL MICROSOFT GO TOMORROW?

   WASHINGTON _ If you're unclear whether Microsoft has monopoly
power, buy a new machine from a large mail-order computer maker.
The antitrust issues being debated in a federal court here will
spring to life.
</P>
<P>
   Most manufacturers pride themselves in offering customers
choices: On a price-adjusted basis, your next computer can come
with a regular monitor or a jumbo model or none at all.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft Windows is a lock: Low-volume buyers get three
options. There's Windows 95. There's Windows 98, an updated clone
of 95 (and a best buy since both versions sell for the same price).
And there's industrial-strength Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   What if you already have a Windows license and want to roll your
own installation? Then you must look elsewhere for what the trade
calls a bare drive.
</P>
<P>
   Big makers of small computers who license Windows from Microsoft
at well below retail prices say they must force-feed their
customers to guard against piracy. Moreover, their costs of
supporting installations gone awry could easily exceed the $40 or
so a copy that they typically pay Microsoft for the operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   Are there a better ways to obtain one? You bet.
</P>
<P>
   Most folks will be using Windows on Intel-compatible computers
for some time to come. And the most logical way to pay for services
is by subscription _ the same way people get their phones, cable
programs or home-delivered newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Under such a model, Microsoft would get, say, $19.95 a year from
each user. Large and predictable revenue streams should keep Bill
Gates happy. In return, Microsoft would release frequent updates
and take over the entire Windows support burden from the Compaqs
and the Dells. (Internal Microsoft documents released at the
antitrust trial show the company would readily accept such a
trade-off.)
</P>
<P>
   For more adventurous types, already some 10 million strong,
there's Linux, an alternative operating system that can be made to
run like a clone of Windows. It's powerful. And it's free.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental reason for the popularity of Linux is the need
for a reliable, vendor-independent system which no single company
dominates,'' says Jitendra Saxena, whose firm has been writing
applications for the Unix mother ship since 1983. ``That's what's
driving the movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Unix has long been the system of choice for large machines. In
1991, a Finnish student guru named Linus Torvalds built his own
version. After Torvalds posted his work on the Internet,
programmers around the world went to work improving his code.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Intel and Netscape, eager to stick it to Microsoft,
invested several million dollars in Red Hat Software. The North
Carolina firm sells a value-added version of Linux for about $50, a
small slice of what Microsoft charges for its big NT servers.
(Microsoft's lawyers have been taking copies of Linux to court to
show the judge that their client is no monopolist.)
</P>
<P>
   Those who can see a time when most applications come to us via
Web browsers, linked to Linux servers, and a time when Windows can
be had through a bargain-priced subscription, can also see a time
when today's bothersome antitrust issues wither away.

 &HT;    The bodice politic: From ballot box to ball gown

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Listen closely.
</P>
<P>
   You can practically hear the rustle of satin and silk as Austin
alteration experts perform last-minute sartorial surgery on
inaugural gowns.
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural balls, on Tuesday, arguably qualify as Austin's
dressiest events.
</P>
<P>
   So forget, for a minute, the political posturing that's bound to
take place. Focus instead on something really important.
</P>
<P>
   Like, what will everyone be wearing?
</P>
<P>
   We asked some notables about their wardrobe plans. Purposefully
neglectedwere ball-goers of the male gender, whose attire leans
uniformly toward black and white.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth's second term
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush's inaugural gown, and the suit and coat she'll wear
for the swearing-in ceremony and parade, were created by Michael
Faircloth.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth, the in-house designer for Lilly Dodson in Dallas,
also designed Bush's 1995 inaugural wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush's daytime wear, Faircloth has created a jewel-necked,
fringe-detailed lavender suit, crafted of Texas mohair.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas first lady's evening gown has a bodice of cranberry
and caramel colored French lace re-embroidered with mohair and
adorned with amber and ruby-colored beads. A skirt of silk panne is
detailed with a richly beaded hip band.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage of long skirt
</P>
<P>
   Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander said she'll worry about
clothing her ``short, squatty body'' at the very last minute.
Something about being tied up getting a biennial revenue estimate
ready for the Legislature last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about it (the inaugural events),'' she said. ``But
I really haven't had a chance to think about it. I'm told I can't
wear my tennis shoes or my Rockport walking shoes. Although if I
have a long skirt, I might get by with tennis shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rylander, decidedly not a pastel person, will probably pick
something vividly colored, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Formal or best Western?
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, the city's casual fashion profile has
grown progressively more formal, said Pamela Willeford, co-chair of
the Inaugural Committee. But the inauguration festivities, drawing
participants from around the state and beyond, have always been an
opportunity to dress up, though cocktail length dresses and Western
wear aren't unusual either, said Willeford. She's chosen a
floor-length pale silver-gray Escada gown with a squared neckline,
empire waist and beaded bodice.
</P>
<P>
   Warm in wool
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has the time or inclination to spend lots of time
finding just the right thing to wear. Sandy Cornyn takes an
expedient approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately our lives have been going so fast, I just go to my
closet and put something on,'' said Cornyn, who is married to
Attorney General John Cornyn.
</P>
<P>
   She will wear a black wool gabardine suit with jeweled buttons
to the inaugural balls. It's one she bought a few years back,
``probably at Dillard's,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Cornyn said, it's liable to keep her warm, a
priority since she gets cold easily. With comfort in mind, she'll
wear black satin low-heeled pumps.
</P>
<P>
   The perils of petite-ness
</P>
<P>
   Gay Gaddis owner of advertising and marketing firm T3 and a Bush
appointee, will wear a black velvet gown with gold brocade adorning
the bodice and a back with a deep ``V'' cut. Gaddis, whose petite
size 2 figure makes buying clothes a challenge, described a
frenzied shopping trip to New York, where she finally found the
gown at Bergdorf Goodman hours before leaving.
</P>
<P>
   She'll wear blue velvet
</P>
<P>
   Anita Perry began working with an Austin designer after shopping
in vain for several weeks. She'd take something home, only to be
vetoed by her 12-year-old daughter or her husband, Lt. Gov.-elect
Rick Perry, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a friend recommended she meet with Maggie Mann.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked in the door and immediately bonded with her,'' Perry
said. ``She's young and vibrant and very intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat, too. But fashion is nonpartisan, Perry decided.
</P>
<P>
   Mann advised her client to forget about the bronze color scheme
she had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Perry will wear a royal blue velvet and chiffon gown
with a cowl neckline, three-quarter-length sleeves and flowing
skirt. She'll accessorize the gown with crystal earrings and a
diamond drop necklace that were gifts from her husband in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said her predecessor, Jan Bullock, has advised her to wear
comfortable shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Undecided voter
</P>
<P>
   Another inaugural-goer who hasn't yet spent much time pondering
her wardrobe is Robin Shivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm notorious for not deciding what I wear until the day of an
event,'' said Shivers, whose husband Allan Jr. is chairman of the
Inaugural Committee. (Her late mother-in-law, Marialice Shivers,
was Texas first lady in 1949).
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be from By George or Fetish or some little strange
shop in Soho,'' Shivers said.
</P>
<P>
   High visibility
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural Commissioner Susan Combs is also likely to be
picking up something to wear at the last minute, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Combs, a rancher with a fondness for blue jeans, typically wears
a long black chiffon skirt with a beaded top for dress-up
occasions. She may pick out a new beaded top the day of the
inaugural ball, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not tiny,'' said Combs, who is 6 feet, 2 1/2 inches tall.
``It's not always easy to find something that looks nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be tasteful, elegant, attractive and comfortable,''
Combs added. ``I'm going to be so visible no matter what I wear.''

 &HT;    Former Texas first ladies recall some of their famous 'first
dresses'
 &HT;    WITH ILLUSTRATIONS, PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Julie Bonnin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It was periwinkle blue, a Mary McFadden gown,
and it is unlikely that Linda Gale White will ever forget it.
</P>
<P>
   If you were living in Texas then, you might even remember the
tale of White's pretty little blue dress.
</P>
<P>
   White, the Texas first lady-elect in 1983, had gone with some
girlfriends on a shopping trip to New York City. They hired a
limousine driver to ferry them around, and right after she finally
found the dress she loved, her friends' fur coats were snatched out
of the car. This made news, international news.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the new first lady was being skewered for not finding a
cute little ol' dress right here in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, with a full term under her belt, an experienced
mother-in-law to advise her, and a husband in the national
spotlight, won't be following in White's footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   She selected a native Texas designer; her ensembles feature Lone
Star fibers.
</P>
<P>
   Any skewering this time around presumably will be limited to the
fancy hors d'oeuvres.
</P>
<P>
   But her selections, as White found, won't go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   White, who now splits time between Houston and Dripping Springs,
wasn't exactly new to politics when she realized the Eyes of Texas
were upon her. Husband Mark White had been Texas attorney general
and secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she said, the gown controversy ``was an awakening.
What I had on had never been anyone's concern. Suddenly it became
everyone's concern. People were going to start looking at me. It
was a quick lesson that I was part of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesson or not, White said, an inauguration is one of those
defining moments, when what the first lady wears really does
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the highlight of your life. It's like your wedding day.
You want to look your best when you walk down the aisle,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years earlier, Nellie Connally also thought it was
important to look her best during the 1963 inaugural festivities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an exciting time for both John and me,'' said Connally,
who now lives in Houston. ``We were going to try to be a good first
family. I wanted to look as good as I could _ not for me, but for
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   So off she went to Neiman Marcus. With tastemaker Stanley Marcus
as her guide, Connally found what she was looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yards and yards and yards of pale green chiffon,'' Connally
said, recalling the Burke-Amez-designed silk gown with a
multicolored bodice and full-length coat in a matching print.
</P>
<P>
   Another Texas first lady, Rita Clements, may be the only one
who's had to compete with her husband for fashion renown. Long-time
Texans may be more likely to remember Bill Clements' legendary
plaid jackets than the formal gowns she wore to inaugural events in
1979 and 1987.
</P>
<P>
   But the red, single-shouldered gown she chose in 1979 and yellow
silk taffeta dress she wore to the 1987 inaugural galas were
beauties.
</P>
<P>
   She still wears the yellow dress, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think long dresses don't really go out of style,'' said
Clements, now of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for a two-piece bronze and black silk cocktail suit that
she wore to a 1979 inaugural event. Clements started wearing it
again recently when designers began showing padded shoulders again.

   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ If you think the Monica Lewinsky matter
merits impeachment, take a look at the increasingly dippy UNSCOM

   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ If you think the Monica Lewinsky matter
merits impeachment, take a look at the increasingly dippy UNSCOM
spy scandal as something more like a real reason to throw a

no sex life worth worrying about. (Rosenfeld, Cox News Service)

   TEXAS-INAUGFASHION _ Linda Gale White's dress was periwinkle
blue, a Mary McFadden gown, and it's unlikely she'll ever forget
it. The dress made news after White and some friends went to New
York City on a shopping trip; fur coats were snatched and suddenly
everyone was skewering the new first lady for not finding a cute
little 'ole dress here in Texas. That was White's wakeup call, she
says, the moment she realized the eyes of Texas were upon her.
Presumably Laura Bush, with a wizened mother-in-law to advise her,
a full term under her belt and a husband in the national spotlight
already knows the importance of choosing the right dress. (Bonnin,
Austin American-Statesman). 15. WITH ILLUSTRATIONS and PHOTOS

His extraordinary metamorphosis made headlines at the time and was
the subject of a 1995 article in The New Yorker magazine, To See Or
Not To See, by neurologist Oliver Sacks. His experiences also
inspired the movie ``At First Sight,'' starring Val Kilmer in the
role of the blind masseur and Mira Sorvino as his love interest.
The movie premieres Friday in Atlanta theaters. (Kim, Atlanta

VISUALS, NOT EMOTIONS, LIFT WAR FILM ABOVE THE RANK AND FILE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The difference between a director and a filmmaker is almost as
maddening as ``the thin red line'' that author James Jones wrote
about in his novel of the same name, that line that separates
sanity from madness. If a filmmaker is someone whose talents are
suited to the medium _ whose forte is distilling the visual power
of movies so distinctly that we recognize his signature in every
scene _ then Terrence Malick is undoubtedly a filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   His adaptation of ``The Thin Red Line'' is steeped in majesty;
he rules the medium like a Norse god. Pulled into his vistas, we're
under the control of a man who thinks with his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He plunges his cameras into the sheer freakiness of the U.S.
invasion of Guadalcanal during World War II. The American soldiers
are so lost, dislocated by the unusual landscape, that it's as if
they've been dropped into someone else's idea of heaven. Scenes
with the thick, high grass, rolling and shifting like ocean waves,
and the indigenous tribespeople, with flawless dark skin and
elegant high cheekbones, going obliviously about their lives as
columns of Marines march past them, have a starkness that we're
unused to seeing in a big-budget studio film.
</P>
<P>
   But if we look to a director for his ability to draw us into the
emotional lives of his characters, then perhaps Malick isn't a
director. We end up admiring his use of the camera, the painted
landscapes so natural and breathtaking they take on a life of their
own. Still, this is the best movie he has made, if only because
it's the best cast he has ever worked with. Many of the best actors
of their generation (the cast includes Nick Nolte, Sean Penn and,
in smaller roles, Woody Harrelson, John Cusack, John Travolta and
George Clooney) clamored to work with Malick after his self-imposed
20-year absence. Nolte, as an ambitious slug of an officer, and
Penn, as a laconic, decent non-com, do fine, honestly felt work and
briefly provide a human connection to the movie's complicated
goings-on.
</P>
<P>
   Though Malick hasn't made a movie since 1978's ``Days of
Heaven,'' which also teemed with unforgettable imagery, it's as if
he picked up where he left off. Like ``Heaven,'' and his first
film, ``Badlands,'' ``Line'' is filled with interior monologues.
But the actors' narration is so full of portent, you're dying to
hear someone say, ``My nose itches.'' No one seems capable of a
mundane thought.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see what attracted Malick to Jones' material. In
the book, Jones gets at what happens to men when fear becomes such
a constant presence that they come through the other side. Facing
imminent death while struggling to make sense of an alien terrain
burns away the elements that make them part of polite society;
those characteristics are replaced with a heightened sense of
trying to make peace with themselves that represents emotional
purity.
</P>
<P>
   This Zen state is what Malick is trying to reach, too, though he
comes at it from another direction. His work is often about lurid,
sensational subjects (''Badlands'' followed a serial killer and his
girlfriend and ``Heaven'' was about a pack of con artists bilking a
lonely, dying man), but as glimpsed under a microscope.
</P>
<P>
   So, unless an actor is capable of blasting through the veils of
visual splendor _ like Nolte or Penn _ he becomes interchangeable.
All the hot young actors cast as the dogfaces probably will burst
into tears when they see that they've been rendered as ciphers. Ben
Chaplin registers only because he's featured having meaningless
flashbacks about a woman back home.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his Olympian distance from the characters, Malick
seems the least likely director to take on a Jones novel. Unlike
Malick, Jones' talent is the gift of empathy. You suffer with
Jones' men and the pettiness that pops up at moments when man
should be at his best. Fear lubricates his narrative, keeps it
moving, so that we see what it makes men capable of. Malick can
render a grand, sumptuous moment, but even then it's devoid of
feeling; he's like an interior decorator coordinating the end of
the world.

MUSICAL LIVES PLAYED OUT IN COUNTERPOINT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Comparing the best of two decades' worth of rock artists, critic
Robert Christgau once wrote that pitting the '60s vs. the '70s
pitted genius vs. talent every time. Genius vs. talent applies to
classical music in ``Hilary and Jackie,'' the two qualities being
the dividing line between real-life sisters Jacqueline and Hilary
du Pre.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline (Emily Watson) was the genius; the '60s cellist had
cover-girl looks and a rock-star flamboyance, but her brilliance
flirted with madness, which was later exacerbated by her
contracting multiple sclerosis. Sister Hilary (Rachel Griffiths), a
talented flutist, settles for a ``normal'' country life with a
charming husband and a couple of kids; she's less gifted musically
but, the movie contends, more blessed in life. Naturally, each
sister envies what the other has.
</P>
<P>
   Few instruments communicate melancholia as well as the cello,
especially in the heart-rending Elgar concerto that dominates the
movie's soundtrack. Similarly, few actresses communicate loneliness
as well as Watson, who brings a heavy-heartedness to even Jackie's
most flirtatious, whimsical moments. Watson's wide blue eyes and
thinly pursed mouth may be the most expressive in movies right now;
she uses them to suggest emotions that her characters' words can't
express. Her performance here elevates the film past a TV-movie
level, even as it turns increasingly showy as her MS progresses in
the third act.
</P>
<P>
   That Griffiths, in a much more steady role, can stand with
Watson is a tribute to her own performance; if Watson elevates the
movie, Griffiths gives it an anchor that keeps it from flying
apart. The two actresses dominate to a point that David Morrissey
and James Frain, who play their respective husbands, are almost
afterthoughts, despite the two actors' solid performances. Even
Jackie's marriage to pianist Daniel Barenboim (Frain), the
classical-music equivalent of a royal wedding, is treated in an
offhand way.
</P>
<P>
   Director Anand Tucker and screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce
bring a symmetrical construction to the movie, which is told
episodically: We first see the two musicians as little girls, with
Jackie's emotional drive eventually eclipsing the more promising
Hilary's practical work ethic. The movie then separates to tell
their individual stories, first from Hilary's point of view, then
from Jackie's (in which her homesickness and exhaustion form a
paranoia that turns her cello into a supporting character).
</P>
<P>
   There's a bit of self-consciousness to this construction, as
Tucker and Boyce become so intent on repeating themes that
occasionally they hammer their points home too hard; when Hilary
and future husband Kiffer Finzi (Morrissey) plan to see Jules and
Jim, for instance, it's a sure sign that an awkward triangle will
eventually develop between the couple and Jackie. But the recurring
symmetry is less bothersome than the almost pristine treatment
Tucker gives the film; it's so neatly constructed that it never
becomes engrossing, even as it never becomes uninvolving.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves much of the work to Watson and Griffiths (and to
Elgar), who give us more than enough reason to see it. But like ``A
Civil Action,'' it's a film so determined not to manipulate that it
keeps us at a distance and so determined to be accessible that the
less familiar you are with the sisters' real-life story, the more
you're likely to enjoy the movie.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray, Steve Dollar and Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``At First Sight'' PG-13 (profanity, sexuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Val Kilmer, Mira Sorvino.
</P>
<P>
   Val Kilmer plays a blind man who regains his sight. But this
fact-based drama, loosely based on a metro Atlanta couple, never
finds its focus. Mira Sorvino plays Kilmer's new love, but the
chemistry between the stars is as bleak and gray as the wintry
setting. 2 hours, 8 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life''G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia
Louis-Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   A multi-legged wonder. The newest computer-animated feature from
the makers of ``Toy Story'' is the eye-popping, witty tale of an
ant named Flik (voice of Dave Foley), who recruits a bunch of
circus bugs to battle evil grasshoppers (the chief villain is
voiced by Kevin Spacey). There's enough going on here to keep every
adult, child or arachnid vastly entertained. 1 hour, 34 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action'' PG-13 (profanity and mature themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a true story, this legal thriller stars John Travolta
as a small-time personal injury lawyer who tackles two giant
corporations whose careless waste management caused leukemia in a
dozen kids. Robert Duvall is his cagey opponent. Travolta is
miscast and the movie can't quite decide what its focus is. Still,
it more than makes its case with intelligence and old-fashioned
Hollywood ``let us entertain you'' craft. 2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the Delta'' PG-13 (profanity, drug references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alfre Woodard and Al Freeman Jr.
</P>
<P>
   This warm, funny, utterly engaging family film insists you can
go home again, even if you've never been there before. Alfre
Woodard stars as a messed-up Chicago single mom with two kids. Her
own mother (Mary Alice) ships her south to Mississipppi to stay
with her uncle (Al Freeman Jr.) and try to get her life straight.
At metro theaters. 1 hour, 41 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth'' R (violence and sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   This opulent period film puts a slight feminist gloss on the
early reign of 16th-century monarch Elizabeth I, showing her
transformation from a radiant, saucy innocent to a polished,
guarded ruler. Cate Blanchett gives a luminous portrayal, and
Geoffrey Rush gives her sturdy support as court politics and
intrigues swirl about. This is a really good story. Of a girl
becoming a woman, of a woman becoming a queen. 2 hours, 4 minutes.
A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy of the State'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Will Smith, Gene Hackman and Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   Recycling paranoia plot devices from other movies (``The
Conversation,'' ``Three Days of the Condor''), Tony Scott's lively
thriller keeps Will Smith and Gene Hackman on the run from big
government bad guys. A sharp cast and slick production compensate
for the movie's occasional lapses in logic. 2 hours, 7 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``The Faculty'' R (profanity, violence, gore, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Elijah Wood, Jon Stewart and Bebe Neuwirth.
</P>
<P>
   Although most high school students might compare their teachers
to aliens, at Herrington High they really are. In this flimsy and
unoriginal but fun monster-thriller, the students band together to
fight their fate when they discover that their teachers, including
the football coach (Robert Patrick) and the principal (Bebe
Neuwirth), want to turn them into computer-generated creepies. (Cox
News Service)1 hour, 50 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ghosts of Dickens' Past'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Christopher Heyerdahl
</P>
<P>
   In this earnest but dull family film, the young Charles Dickens
(Christopher Heyerdahl) recounts a ghostly encounter with a young
girl who inspired ``A Christmas Carol.'' It's well intended, but it
drains the magic out of the Christmas classic.1 hour, 30 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   Not rated but contains sexual themes and brief nudity.
</P>
<P>
   A brilliant re-imagining of the final days of gay British
director James Whale. Whale, best known for his classic horror
movies (``Bride of Frankenstein''), died mysteriously in 1957. Ian
McKellen is marvelous as a recluse who becomes interested in the
new gardener (Brendan Fraser). There's excellent work all around,
but McKellen is the movie's gnawing, unsettling center. 1 hour, 35
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Hilary and Jackie'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   Never quite hitting its intended crescendo, this real-life
psychological drama about the relationship between two musical
sisters still strikes some major chords. Emily Watson (``Breaking
the Waves'') stars as Jacqueline du Pre, a world-famous cellist who
died in 1987 of multiple sclerosis. Rachel Griffiths plays her
sister, Hilary, who swapped a career for cozy domesticity. 2 hours.
B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurlyburly'' R (profanity, violence and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright Penn and Meg
Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   A terrific acting ensemble, a terrible script. Sean Penn and
Kevin Spacey are the unstable center _ casting partners and condo
roomies _ around whom circle hangers-on (Chazz Palminteri, Garry
Shandling) and disposable women (Meg Ryan, Robin Wright Penn). Set
in 1980s Hollywood, the movie is about things like sex, drugs,
misogyny and maleness. It's actually a saga in free-fall that ends
up in a talky, coked-up tailspin.2 hours, 2 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``In Dreams'' R (violence and disturbing themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   In what could be called ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' meets ``The
Eyes of Laura Mars,'' a psychic woman (Annette Bening) is harassed
in her dreams by a child-murdering pyscho. For at least an hour,
the movie is truly eerie and disturbing, but an overly long
encounter between Bening and the madman proves damaging. 1 hour, 40
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Frost'' PG (mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Keaton and Kelly Preston.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Keaton plays a dead dad who comes back as a talking
snowman and teaches his son to play hockey. We're not making this
up. The synthetic, special-effects driven comedy is another of
those stale Hollywood sermons about taking time out for your kids.
It's less substantial than a snowball in July. 1 hour, 36 minutes.
D
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' PG-13 (Holocaust-related atrocities)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian Jew shields his son from the horrors of a
concentration camp by pretending their predicament is part of a
big, complicated game. It certainly takes a certain courage to put
a life-affirming spin on Hitler's Final Solution, but Benigni's
low-comedy slapstick approach isn't entirely convincing and is
often chillingly wrongheaded. In Italian with English subtitles.2
hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Voice'' R (profanity, brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jane Horrocks, Brenda Blethyn and Michael Caine.
</P>
<P>
   British actress Jane Horrocks, who can belt out tone-perfect
impersonations of everyone from Judy Garland to Shirley Bassey, is
pretty much the whole show here. The rest of the film, alas, is a
fairly feeble show-biz fable in which her blowzy mom (Brenda
Blethyn) and a seedy agent (Michael Caine) try to get this shy
recluse on stage. See it for Horrocks; check out the concession
stand in between her numbers. 1 hour, 30 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Modulations'' N/R
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alec Empire, Bill Laswell, Holger Czukay, Genesis
P-Orridge, Teo Macero, Stacey Pullen and Robert Moog.
</P>
<P>
   In this documentary on the proliferating electronic music scene,
Iara Lee has put together an alternative history of 20th-century
music, beginning with Italian futurism _ Luigi Russolo's 1931
manifesto ``The Art of Noise'' _ and winding up at urban warehouse
parties where techno subgenres like ``jungle'' and ``gabba'' drive
young audiences to ecstasy. 1 hour, 15 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams'' PG-13 (profanity, crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays a renegade med student who believes the
rigid rules of health care could use a few laughs. It's ``Dead
Poets Society'' with lab coats. The laughs are good, but when it
tries to get serious (often), the flick is as deep as a bedpan.1
hour, 56 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' PG (violence, intense themes)
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Val Kilmer and Ralph Fiennes.
</P>
<P>
   A spectacular animated musical epic that retells _ with some
embellishments _ the Book of Exodus. Val Kilmer is the voice of
Moses, God's choice to lead the Hebrew people from slavery in
Egypt. Ralph Fiennes speaks for the Pharaoh, Moses' ``adopted''
brother. Other talent includes Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and
a host of animators. The movie is visually impressive, insistently
reverential.1 hour, 39 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Psycho'' R (violence, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche.
</P>
<P>
   A slavishly faithful remake of the Hitchcock classic. It's very
well made and acted, with a terrific performance by Vince Vaughn as
Norman Bates. But it's an odd cinematic experiment that never seems
to know exactly what it intended to prove. At Snellville Oaks 14
and Starlight Drive-In. 1 hour, 38 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rugrats Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of E.G. Daily and Christine Cavanaugh.
</P>
<P>
   The Rugrats hit the big screen with a big issue: making way for
a new baby. The film version of the TV hit is amiable, if frenetic,
aimed at kids who need to be stimulated every few seconds.1 hour,
19 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' R (sexuality, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Poor, overworked Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) has to finish
his play ``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'' and try to win
the hand of noblewoman Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) in this witty comedy
that uses some of the Bard's more outrageous plot devices. The
script's cleverness can sometimes get in the way of genuine
feeling, but its ambition is refreshing. 2 hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``A Simple Plan'' R (profanity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Director Sam Raimi's movie is anything but simple. It's a
character-driven black comedy with some powerful moral-qualm
undercurrents. In the deep snows of rural Minnesota, two brothers
(Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton) and a pal (Brent Briscoe) find a
downed plane with $4 million in cash. Their ``simple plan'' to
split the money leads to a chain of increasingly disastrous events.
1 hour, 57 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' PG (sci-fi violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner and Donna Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise crew saves an eternally youthful tribe from an
ugly crowd that wants to steal its juju. The movie is full of jokes
and decent special effects. But it seems primarily designed for
Trekkers who need an update on their intergalactic family album.1
hour, 44 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepmom'' PG-13 (profanity, adult themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts play competing moms _ one
biological, the other step _ in this comedy/weepie that tackles
some complex ``blended family'' issues, then cops out by giving a
character a fatal disease. Still, the sturdy cast does much to
redeem the mush-headed script (add Ed Harris in the dishonest role
of doting dad who somehow never sees his kids). 2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thin Red Line'' R (profanity and war violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, Nick Nolte, Woody Harrelson
and Adrien Brody.
</P>
<P>
   Less a war movie than a meditation on life, death, love, hate,
man and nature. Terrence Malick puts his unmistakable stamp on the
drama of an Army division's struggle to capture Guadalcanal from
the Japanese during World War II. Fueled with voice-overs, gorgeous
images and sudden violence, it's superbly strange, an epic that
feels intimate but distant at the same time. 2 hours, 50 minutes.
B-
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The new IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a
fictional story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a
budding teenage paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her
dino-hunting dad (Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be
a dinosaur egg into his lab, Ally, alone with it, accidentally
cracks it and is thrust back in time 65 million years, when the big
beasts roamed the earth.40 minutes. B-

abuse)
</P>

   James Van Der Beek plays a high school football player in this
insulting mix of beery teenage humor and rampant sexuality.1 hour,

   ``Waking Ned Devine'' PG (sexual themes, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian Bannen and David Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   A broad, twinkly Irish comedy about what happens in a tiny
village when it's discovered that one of the residents is the
holder of a lottery ticket worth nearly $7 million. The movie is a
little too eager to please, a little too Lucky Charms Irish. But
the two leads, devilish old-pro codgers Ian Bannen and David Kelly,
are practiced charmers, and there are lots of winning little
moments along the way.1 hour, 30 minutes. B-

<P>
   ``The Waterboy'' PG-13 (comic violence, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adam Sandler and Kathy Bates.
</P>
<P>
   A watered-down comedy. After a successful stab at romantic
comedy in ``The Wedding Singer,'' Adam Sandler returns to his
lowbrow roots with this ``Happy Gilmore'' rewrite about a bayou
bumpkin who becomes a college football star. It's dumb and
predictable, which would be OK if there were more laughs. But Kathy
Bates is hilarious as Sandler's domineering mama. 1 hour, 26

MANY CHINESE LEFT IN DARK ON CRACKDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ The ancient Chinese proverb _ ``Kill the chicken to
scare the monkey'' _ has been oft quoted to explain why Beijing has
so harshly silenced dissent in the last month, meting out long
prison terms to peaceful activists and threatening life sentences
to writers or artists who criticize the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party must crack down on dissidents, the logic
goes, to frighten regular citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth may be even bleaker. The ``monkey'' isn't aware
the ``chicken'' is being sacrificed _ nor does he much care.
Average Chinese don't need to be scared into toeing the government
line, because for the most part, they already do.
</P>
<P>
   To many in China's most modern and progressive city, ``human
rights'' means the right to make a living. Political freedoms may
come later, but few seem very concerned about when that may be.
Only one of numerous people interviewed had even heard of the 11-
to 13-year terms recently handed down to democracy campaigners. And
while a few said it sounded unfair, many said the men must have
threatened the state to deserve such treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown comes after a year that saw two major dissidents
freed and deported to the United States, President Jiang Zemin
debating human rights with President Clinton on live television,
reformist ideas flourishing in intellectual circles, and China
signing a United Nations human rights covenant. So it was a
surprise to many foreign observers that the apparent breath of
fresh air dubbed ``Beijing spring'' was snuffed out by winter.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the drama surrounding the detention of dozens of democracy
activists last month, harsh new limits on speech, and warnings
given to 10 more dissidents last  &UR; week &LR;  was news to Shanghai
residents interviewed. Though the state-controlled media broke its
practice of ignoring critics by reporting the sentences given to
those who tried to establish the China Democracy Party, the
information has not reached most people.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I believe you just because you tell me this?'' said
Jeffrey Yao, 28, a shipping company employee. ``And if they didn't
have permission to start a party or didn't register their party,
then of course they should expect problems,'' he said of three
imprisoned leaders of the first opposition party since the founding
of the communist state, and two exiles sent to labor camps for
entering China illegally to aid the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays in China, it is not possible to establish a
multiparty government, so people shouldn't think they can,'' said
Zhang Q., a 25-year-old hotel worker who would not give her full
name. ``A multiparty system might bring faster development of the
economy, but it might also bring disorder. I don't know that I want
to take that risk if I have the choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai is a place that showcases how far China has come and
how far it still has to go _ where Versace and Ralph Lauren
boutiques share the sidewalk with laid-off laborers selling pirated
goods; where nightclubs book uncensored acts, but newspapers remain
government mouthpieces; where shiny new taxis vie for the road with
battered bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   Average citizens here say that because of economic progress and
looser moral codes brought on by two decades under China's ``open
door policy,'' they feel freer than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   But those liberties _ greater opportunities to pursue the work
they want and to talk freely with friends and family _ are freedoms
they equate with a stable nation. And to most people, stability
means the Communist Party. The combination of government propaganda
and the memory of a painful modern history of revolution and
upheaval has convinced most ordinary people that politics isn't
worth the trouble and that dissidents could be troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard for me to tell whether it's good to have more
freedom or bad to have more freedom,'' said Sandra Liu, a
21-year-old computer programming trainee. ``For regular citizens,
of course it's better to have the right to speak and write. But
it's possible that if we have these freedoms, some bad people might
use them to bring disorder. I guess that's why the central
government does what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also fears a slowdown in growth and the painful
side effects of restructuring a controlled economy. China watchers
speculate that after a year that brought thousands of protests over
unemployment, pensions, and housing, authorities are taking a tough
stand against unrest while they downsize state-owned enterprises at
the cost of millions of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Communist Party officials are believed to fear a coalition
between labor groups and political activists that could prove
stronger than student-led protests in 1989. That may explain the
10-year sentence to labor activist Zhang Shanguang for talking
about farmers' protests to Radio Free Asia.
</P>
<P>
   This year also marks several emotional dates that Beijing may
fear could inspire protests _ the 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen
crackdown, the 50th anniversary of the communist state, the 80th
anniversary of China's first modern reform movement by students and
intellectuals, the 40th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising, and
the 10th anniversary of martial law in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many people say they wouldn't dream of protesting, because
they wouldn't want to cause disorder that could slow economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elections and democracy aren't important. As long as we have a
good living, we don't care who is our mayor,'' said Wang L.L., a
30-year-old office clerk. ``When you tell me about the crackdown, I
say of course it's reasonable for the Chinese Communist Party to
crack down, because they feel threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is not ready for multiparty politics or democracy in
China . . . because people's minds aren't ready,'' said Zhou Jian
Ping, 49, a retired factory worker. She compared multiparty
politics to new stock exchange regulations, saying that had the
rules been passed a decade ago, they would have been meaningless,
because no one understood how a stock exchange worked.
</P>
<P>
   Even more tellingly, some said it was debatable whether
democracy activists represented the aspirations of most Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid (dissidents) wouldn't get much support from the
general population, because people have a different understanding
of freedom, human rights. I think human rights is the right to make
a living, the right to work. These are the two most important
things, so people can survive,'' said Wu Z.S., 52, a businessman.
``American people may think the situation here is very bad, but
Chinese people think it's quite good.''
</P>
<P>
   The only person who had heard of the crackdown, a middle-aged
manager who found the news on the Internet, said it is not
surprising that people _ including himself _ wouldn't question the
government over its actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout Chinese history, we have always obeyed authority _
the authority of the emperor, the father, the teacher,'' said the
man.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, ``we feel we have more freedoms now. We can
talk, say what we think _ just not in a public forum or a
newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, whose name is being withheld, was briefly questioned by
a group of police officers after talking to this reporter, and was
visibly shaken when let go.

WRONG FOCUS IMPAIRS `SIGHT'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``At First Sight'' is a curious object, one of the most
fascinating bad movies ever made. Fascinating because of its
subject matter: Pulled from the writings of the neurologist Dr.
Oliver Sacks, ``Sight'' follows a blind man who lost his vision as
a baby and has it returned to him through an operation more than 30
years later. Bad, because the routine love story that has been
poured over it covers the intense surprise in an unusual suspense
tale. Can a blind man learn to see?
</P>
<P>
   And as Virgil, the blind masseur, Val Kilmer gives one of the
most rigorously worked-out performances to be seen in years. With
his easy smile and manner, he has almost a gigolo's confidence. His
silken, alert voice enters a room before he does. At times, it's
almost as if he employs his larynx as an extra set of hands,
feeling out the contours of a room _ or a person he's speaking to.
(An extra fillip: With his serene cool, dirty-blond hair and
pointed cleft chin, Kilmer looks like Matt Murdock, the alter ego
of Marvel Comics' blind superhero Daredevil.)
</P>
<P>
   After Virgil has the operation, he can't relate the world
visually. It doesn't make sense to him, because visual acceptance
is a learned skill and he has regarded the world entirely through
his other senses. Confronted with concepts that confuse, Virgil is
scared. And here Kilmer does the work with his voice. He sounds
abject, humiliated _ ironically, with sight restored he's more
handicapped than ever. Kilmer's meticulousness is a little obvious,
but he grabs the part and runs off with it.
</P>
<P>
   As Amy, the architect who falls for him, Mira Sorvino has a
lovely anxious quality. Her need to find someone different from
herself is so strong that it almost redeems some of the
embarrassing scenes she has to play. Her first encounter is like
some soft-porn VH1 moment; under Virgil's magic hands, she starts
to weep _ he's killing her softly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sight'' seems afraid of the real drama, Virgil's journey in a
new world. It doesn't cheapen the material as thoroughly as
``Blink,'' a lame thriller about a blind sculptress who witnesses a
murder that obviously pickpocketed some of Sacks' work. This
reworking of ``To See and Not See'' is closer to the case study
than some of the stuff we were fed in ``Awakenings,'' a previous
film version of Sacks' work, because the picture doesn't try to
offer us a watered-down version of a Sacks figure.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin Winkler's facility as a director is limited by
tastefulness _ it never occurs to him to show Virgil's reaction to
seeing Amy's nude body for the first time. Many others could get a
whole movie out of that one moment.

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ One is new to the corner; the other is banned from
it. One is the picture of rectitude; the other has lived for 15
years under a cloud. There could not be two more contrasting fight
trainers squaring off this week in Las Vegas than Tommy Brooks and
Panama Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks was recently added as Mike Tyson's trainer, a job he took
in November after serving as the assistant trainer of Tyson's great
nightmare, Evander Holyfield, as well as working with Pernell
Whitaker and a host of other Lou Duva-managed fighters for 13
years.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has handled the gym work of Francois Botha, Tyson's
scheduled victim Saturday, the last four years but has never been
in his corner on fight night. He was banned from boxing 15 years
ago after being convicted of tampering with the gloves of a club
fighter named Luis Resto in a bout that caused irreversible eye
damage to a young prospect named Billy Collins.
</P>
<P>
   For Brooks, this fight is an effort to build a resume. For
Lewis, it is an effort at redemption. Both understand it might
prove to be far less if things don't go well.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks took over Tyson's training when the former heavyweight
champion regained his license after being suspended from boxing for
twice biting Holyfield's ears in their rematch at the MGM Grand 19
months ago. In the days following that fight, Brooks insisted Tyson
would never beat Holyfield because he was not mentally strong
enough or technically proficient enough.
</P>
<P>
   Now, only months after having left Holyfield to double his pay
as Tyson's trainer, he sings a different tune. Now it is not about
Holyfield. Now it is all about Mike Tyson . . . and his new
trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evander will always be my man, and hopefully, he feels the
same way,'' Brooks said. ``But I wouldn't want to see them fight
again because once I get Tyson right, Tyson would beat him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did our homework on Mike. We realized he was making a lot
of mistakes. He was too squared up. He was depending too much on
his power. He didn't bob and weave. If he changes that and goes
back to what he used to do, I think he'll be fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really nobody right now (who'd give him trouble) if he
keeps working like he is. Until he got beat, I don't think he
realized the bad habits he got into. Maybe he had to lose some
fights to see he didn't have the right corner with him. His
training methods weren't right. Because he was man enough to
realize that and understand it, it gave me some confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, Brooks sounded like a dentist who looks into a new
patient's mouth and starts talking about all the shoddy fillings
he'll have to undo. Though he didn't say it, the implication was
that those fights were more about the trainers than the fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there have been many whispers that Tyson lacks his old
self-confidence, his self-esteem having been knocked as senseless
as he was by Holyfield's dominance. Brooks refused to go that far
but acknowledged, ``My guy's ready. Now it depends on which one
shows up.''
</P>
<P>
   If it is the one who grew hesitant and lost badly to Holyfield
twice and to Buster Douglas, Brooks knows he loses, too. So he
talks publicly of Tyson beating Holyfield yet frets privately about
whether his fighter will unravel mentally if pressured by a
fearless opponent.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Lewis insists Botha has a chance even though the
world doubts it. He believes if his fighter can survive the first
onslaughts and get into the later rounds, he can win because Tyson
will break down mentally, consumed by doubt.
</P>
<P>
   It is a survivalist's plan, and there is no greater example of
its power than Lewis. After Resto's gloves were found to be missing
half the horsehair padding and to contain a quarter-sized hole on
the inside through which it was removed, Lewis and Resto had their
licenses revoked and were sent to jail for two years for tampering
with the outcome of a sporting event and assault with a deadly
weapon (unpadded fists).
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has long insisted he had nothing to do with what happened
that night and claimed he has been tormented for 15 years by
Collins's injuries and his death 10 months later in a car accident
the Collins family believes was suicide because Billy had grown
despondent over the demise of his boxing career.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever caused Collins to die, Lewis believes his long exile is
its byproduct. It's an exile he fights by training boxers in gyms
where no commission has jurisdiction while sitting at ringside like
a fan on fight night shouting instructions that often go unheard.
</P>
<P>
   Although he intends to reapply for a license in New York, where
it was first revoked, and says he would give 5 percent of his
earnings for the rest of his career to Collins's teenage daughter,
Lewis understands he is as much a long shot in that fight as his
fighter is in Saturday night's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry for what happened, but I don't feel me and Resto
killed him,'' Lewis said. ``I'm the scapegoat. I paid my dues for
something I didn't do for 15 years. My father died while I was in
jail. I never saw him again. I more than suffered. Every day I have
that fight in my mind. It don't go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither will the suspicion that Lewis took the padding from
those gloves, traces of which were found in a bathroom stall in
Resto's locker room after the gloves had been impounded. Neither
does the suspicion that the gloves were not faulty, as Lewis
insists, but were loaded to turn a light-hitting fighter into a
lethal weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Botha's manager, Sterling McPherson, has kept his longtime
friend working over the years despite the dark shadow his presence
casts over a fight. He has paid him to train his fighters knowing
he could not counsel them on fight night and is now spearheading an
effort to get Lewis relicensed and using the high profile of this
fight to make his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had money, he never would have went to jail,'' McPherson
said. ``He went to jail because Billy Collins died in a car crash.
They never proved he did anything to those gloves. You don't know
to this day that he took the webbing out of those gloves. I'm not
saying something wasn't wrong with them, but who knows what was
really wrong? Nobody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody knows, and many people in boxing believe it is Lewis.
But as he prepares Botha for the biggest night of his life, that
doesn't matter anymore. All that matters is the same thing that
matters to Tommy Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   What matters is how this fight comes out, because in both men's
cases, their future is at stake.

BAD LIVING GONE BAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I cannot stand this semantic insanity any longer!'' Robin
Wright Penn shouts about 90 minutes into ``Hurlyburly,'' and by the
time that line rolls around, you may feel the same way. An actor's
dream but a viewer's endurance test, the movie takes David Rabe's
play away from its proper home _ the stage _ and places it on the
screen, where pictures count for more than words (and there are
lots of words).
</P>
<P>
   It's not satisfying, but its cast is a wonder to behold,
especially Sean Penn as Eddie, the TV casting director whose life
is out of control. Within the first 10 minutes, Eddie (whose
ever-running TV seems to only receive depressing news channels) has
snorted several lines of cocaine, briefly had two cigarettes going
at once, smoked a joint and eaten a moldy Hostess Sno-Ball, and he
continues this self-destructive behavior for most of the next two
hours. Some critics have chastised Penn for his overacting here,
but his eyebrow-arching, twitching, sputtering, foot-stomping
performance hits the right notes for Eddie, who has the emotional
maturity of a 5-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   He even has his clubhouse, a condo in the Hollywood Hills that
has everything but a ``No Girls Allowed'' sign on the door. He
shares the condo with Mickey (Kevin Spacey), a partner who's so
much more together that he never gets angry; it seems the only
reason Mickey lives with Eddie is so that he can seduce any woman
Eddie falls for. Also hanging out there is Phil (Chazz Palminteri),
a second-rate actor with a puppy's heart and a pit-bull temper;
other characters correctly point out that Phil makes Eddie look
good, and that's why Eddie lets him hang around. Sleazy pal Artie
(Garry Shandling, confidently returning to the big screen for the
first time since 1994's ``Love Affair'') also drops by to partake
in the orgies of drug use and misogyny.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey aside, none of these guys seems to know anything about
women _ or is able to learn from the women who cross their paths,
whether it be the runaway they treat like a sex pet (Anna Paquin),
Eddie's long-suffering girlfriend (Robin Wright Penn), or a
benevolent, wounded hooker (Meg Ryan in a tender-tough, eye-opening
performance) whom Eddie calls in to cure Phil's woes.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much plot, other than the predictably tragic arc
that Phil follows, but plot isn't the point of Rabe's play _ the
dialogue and the characters are the point. Director Anthony Drazan
makes an odd error: He ``opens up'' the play too well, because _
despite some dazzling cinematography by Changwei Gu (''Farewell My
Concubine'') _ the material requires a sense of claustrophobia that
the movie can't communicate. Webster's defines the title as a
turmoil or uproar, but after more than two hours of the characters'
antics, it feels more like it means ``going in circles.''

   Funny how conventional movies about rebels often are. Place a
rebel in a sports movie _ a genre that may have more conventions
than any other _ and you're just asking for cliches. ``Varsity
Blues'' tweaks the formula just enough to almost work, but it just
can't punch things into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, sports movies are about misfit underdogs
whipped into shape by a noncomformist coach; ``Varsity Blues'' is
about a strong small-town Texas high school football squad whose
coach is such a legend, the stadium is named after him and there's
a statue of him at the school's entrance. It takes Jon Moxon, a
second-string quarterback who'd rather read paperbacks than
playbooks, to notice that the coach is a real jerk.
</P>
<P>
   Mox, as they call him, is called into action when the team's
star quarterback suffers a career-ending injury. Turns out Mox is
also a pretty good quarterback, but he wants to do things his own
way, not the coach's _ and the coach is too full of himself to
notice that Mox's way happens to be working. Seeds of rebellion are
sown.
</P>
<P>
   So are seeds of familiarity. ``Dawson's Creek's'' James Van Der
Beek, who has some of the appeal of a young John Cusack (appeal and
talent not being equal), plays Mox as a good-hearted kid who knows
just when to stop fame before it gets to his head. He deals with
and rallies many familiar types: the fat, syrup-swilling center who
has ``crisis'' written all over him (Ron Lester); the good
girlfriend who just doesn't ``understand'' him (Amy Smart); the
vampish cheerleader who just needs to be ``understood'' (Ali
Larter). Only the team smart-mouth (Scott Caan) doesn't seem to
need Mox's help, but then he looks about two years too old for
college football, so he can probably take care of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Voight gives the movie some heft as the martinet coach, but
his villainous roles are also starting to smack of deja vu. W.
Peter Iliff's script has moments when it appears it'll escape
shallowness, but Brian Robbins' direction, which wavers between
flat and overdone, can't save it. An MTV Films co-production, the
movie is loaded with alt-rock songs that sound suspiciously like
they were added after Robbins was finished with it. More
disturbingly cynical is the movie's treatment of adults _ not one
is a good role model _ and its surprising amount of nudity and
substance abuse for a movie aimed at teens.

HORROR, INTELLIGENCE SHARE A BED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The voyeuristic melodrama of director Neil Jordan has finally
led him to come right out and call his latest movie ``In Dreams.''
His films (''Mona Lisa,'' ``The Crying Game,'' ``Interview With the
Vampire,'' ``Michael Collins'') have luscious swirls of
manufactured myth that are laid out a little too heavily _ they
often feel so much like representations of dreams that we're not
sure where the narratives leave off and the inner desires of the
characters start. The symbolism plays like intellectual flash
cards. Still, one thing's for sure: Nobody else makes commercial
movies like he does.
</P>
<P>
   That's the case here, when the movie plunges us into the
subconscious of children's book illustrator Claire (Annette
Bening), whose recurring nightmares about a kidnapped child are
wrecking her home life. They coincide with the ongoing search for a
serial killer who is snatching and murdering children.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Paul (Aidan Quinn), finally convinces her that the
police have to be informed of her dreams, if only so he can put an
end to his wife's awakening with her face clammy from tears. But
things will turn out be so much worse than he, or even she, can
imagine. Each time she closes her eyes, visions of a child being
led to her death leap into her brain. And before long, she's even
having the dreams when she's fully awake.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's masterfully staged emotional chaos is subtler, and more
potent, than the kinds of cheap shocks horror films now provide. He
wants this to be a scare picture for adults, and for Bening's
terror to resonate within and stick with you. And he does a fine
job of providing that. Where else do we feel more susceptible to
the worst violence than in our dreams?
</P>
<P>
   After the lyrical, cool dislocation Jordan sets into motion _ a
scene when a car soars off a bridge is almost worth seeing the
movie for _ ``In Dreams'' becomes a Wes Craven movie, with the
killer (Robert Downey Jr.) chasing her with a scythe. Still,
there's a lot to enjoy here, too.

CLINTON'S POPULARITY SECRET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iwould like to be loved the way Bill Clinton is loved.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to be loved no matter what I did, no matter how I
deceived, no matter whom I hurt. I would like to know that even if
I broke my promises and demeaned my loved ones, even if I brought
harm to honest people and played my admirers for fools, I would
still be loved _ and not by a few, but by many. I would like to be
assured that those who love me do so unconditionally, that there is
nothing, literally nothing, I could do that they would not be
willing to forgive or excuse or overlook. I would like that very
much.
</P>
<P>
   But I will never be loved that way. Neither will you; nor will
any politician now in the field. The force field that envelops
President Clinton _ the blind loyalty and unshakable affection of
his myriad of supporters _ is as close to sui generis as anything
American politics has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   We have had popular presidents before, but we have never had a
president who could not abrade his own popularity through
stupidity, recklessness, or lawbreaking. We have never had a
president whose approval ratings went up even as his
trustworthiness, by common consent, went down. We have never had a
president who was simultaneously being impeached in Congress for
perjury and obstruction of justice and coming in first on the
annual list of most admired men.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost Faustian. Political TNT that would explode the
career of anyone else leaves Clinton's intact.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate smoking gun turns up _ DNA on a blue dress _ but
the Clinton presidency barely wobbles.
</P>
<P>
   After leaders of both parties plead for him to tell the truth
and show remorse, the president delivers a truculent televised
speech that everyone regards as a disaster _ and no harm befalls
him.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that a majority of the public believes he should
resign if impeached _ but no sooner is he impeached than the polls
show something else. What explains it?
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton's sake, the most Olympian voices in our public life
have muted themselves.
</P>
<P>
   All fall, The New York Times editorialized that a congressional
censure of the president would be appropriate only if he ``abandons
publicly and without qualification'' his logic-chopping claim
``that he did not lie under oath about having a sexual relationship
with Monica Lewinsky. Clearly he did.'' Should he persist in his
legalistic denials, the Times said on Sept. 16, ``we are prepared
to see the impeachment process through to a resolution.'' Four days
later, it said it again: ``Impeachment proceedings may be painful
and prolonged, but they need not traumatize the nation. The
constitutional blueprint is sound.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it became plain that Clinton would cling to his denials
no matter what, the Times abruptly reversed course. ``The
president's `low crimes,' '' it now argued, ``do not meet the
constitutional standard for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the Times's about-face is mysterious, what are we to make
of Daniel Patrick Moynihan's? In the fall, New York's respected
senior senator was adamant: There was ``nothing more important''
than dealing with Clinton's perjury and public lies. ``We have a
crisis of the regime,'' he declared. ``You cannot have this kind of
conduct as normal and acceptable and easily dismissed.'' He opposed
any censure deal that would sidestep impeachment. ``We ought to get
on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, no sooner did the matter land on the Senate doorstep than
Moynihan came out for censure after all. ``We have to protect the
presidency as an institution,'' he announced. A Senate conviction
``could very readily destabilize the presidency . . . . Do not
doubt that you could degrade the Republic quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   It must be a powerful magic that protects Bill Clinton if even
Pat Moynihan's integrity cannot withstand it.
</P>
<P>
   I don't buy the argument that Clinton's unsinkability is due to
the economy. It isn't economics that accounts for the fact that not
one Clinton aide has resigned in anger over being used to peddle
the president's lies. And it isn't economics that has kept Clinton
from being knocked down by a train of scandals _ Filegate, the
Travel Office firings, Hillary's commodities killing, Webster
Hubble's payoff, the drug dealers at White House receptions, the
technology-for-campaign-cash China connection, the renting of the
Lincoln Bedroom, Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey _
that would have flattened any other politician.
</P>
<P>
   So what accounts for Clinton's political indestructibility?
Here's my explanation: It is a gift. Men and women who succeed in
politics often have a native ability to get people to like them. In
Clinton, that aptitude is developed to an abnormal degree. He has a
talent for winning and retaining the affection of others in the way
that Warren Buffett has a talent for picking stocks and Michael
Jordan has a talent for shooting baskets. He was born with it.
</P>
<P>
   The president's critics have reason to fume. He is a cocky and
unrepentant liar, and has ever been so. He has learned that, for
him, the bill never comes due. In the long run, Clinton's approval
ratings and reputation will undergo a severe correction. In the
short run, he will be applauded at every turn. That doesn't relieve
senators of their sworn duty to punish his high crimes and
misdemeanors. It just means that they must do it without the
following wind of popular acclaim.

A TREND TOWARD CONVICTION? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Should Bill Clinton be the first president in American history
to be removed from office by the United States Senate? That's the
question on the table in Washington today. As things now stand,
there are not 67 votes for conviction. By the end of the trial,
there may well be.
</P>
<P>
   Familiarity with Clinton's conduct breeds contempt, which
hardens into antipathy. At the beginning of the impeachment
process, House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde said that he thought a
deal could be worked out. A couple of months later, on the eve of
the House vote, Hyde called on the president to resign. Today, Hyde
believes Clinton should be convicted and removed from office by the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The White House would have you believe that Hyde's conversion
from censure to resignation to convictionwas driven by the GOP's
right wing. It was not. Henry Hyde has nothing to fear from anyone.
He is beloved in his congressional district. He is approaching the
end of his political career. He has the luxury of doing what he
thinks is right.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Hyde's conversion was driven by Clinton's
conduct in the Lewinsky matter and, as important, the president's
behavior since then. That conduct in combination with that behavior
is what makes the final Senate vote unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   The level of Clinton's arrogance and dishonesty keeps rising.
Immediately after the House voted to refer Articles of Impeachment
to the Senate, Clinton held a press conference on the White House
lawn. It may be remembered as the most outrageous moment of his
presidency. ``When he gathered that group down on the White House
lawn,'' said Senator Robert Byrd, ``just on the same day following
the impeachment by the House, that was an egregious display of
shameless arrogance the likes of which I don't think I have seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not apologize. He was not contrite. There was no
acknowledgment at all of his personal responsibility. Instead, he
called for an ``end to the politics of personal destruction.'' That
very day, people in his employ were calling and faxing news
organizations in Washington with a list of pharmaceuticals used by
Monica Lewinsky. Having derided her as a stalker, they now implied
that she was addled as well.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the president's lawyers filed a written response to the
Articles of Impeachment. The 13-page brief contained some pointed
criticisms of the articles as written. But the brief was deeply
flawed. ``What makes this latest defense as unsatisfactory as all
the others,'' said the Washington Post editorial page, ``is the
continuing and demeaning failure on the part of the White House
simply to admit (since it cannot deny more credibly) the charges
that the president lied under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the brief maintained that the president did not lie
when he denied having ``sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky as he
understood that term to be defined by the Jones lawyers during
their questioning of him in that deposition.'' ``It is difficult to
find,'' the Post editorial page concluded, ``a single honest
sentence in the factual defense on the perjury charge.''
</P>
<P>
   This combination of arrogance and dishonesty has done enormous
damage to the presidency and the president. No one in Washington
defends Clinton anymore. His own lawyers describe his actions as
``morally reprehensible.'' His best staff people (Leon Panetta,
Erskine Bowles, Mike McCurry) have resigned. The only argument the
White House can muster in the president's defense is that the
charges, as filed, ``don't rise to the level of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   After the House vote on impeachment, New York Observer reporter
Phil Weiss asked Representative James Leach: ``Would you have voted
for these articles if you didn't know what you already know about
this administration from your earlier investigations?'' It's a fair
question and may prove to be the fulcrum upon which the Senate vote
rests.
</P>
<P>
   Most people would argue that the charges, by themselves do not
merit the president's removal from office. Most would argue that
the precedent set by Clinton's removal would do more damage to the
presidency than the precedent set by allowing him to remain.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that the charges against Clinton will not by
considered ``by themselves.'' They will be understood and debated
in the larger context of his ceaseless mendacity, unyielding
arrogance, and brazen disregard for the rule of law. Considered in
that context, Clinton's chances of survival slim down considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Which, after all, is worse? The precedent of removing a
president from office on charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice or the consequences of not doing so. Today, most senators
would say the removal precedent is worse. By trial's end,
two-thirds may reluctantly conclude that the consequences are
simply unacceptable.

CARING ENOUGH TO FEEL SHAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY, Utah _ Like many local residents, Darin Smedley
isn't making excuses. Bribery is wrong, he says. But _ and
inevitably residents offer this but _ Salt Lake City did only what
other cities vying to host the Olympics have done before.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake, however, is a city still capable of shame. Smedley
says he feels it. So does Utah Governor Mike Leavitt. From City
Hall to the ZCMI Center Mall in the capital's well-scrubbed
downtown, people describe themselves as ashamed and embarrassed
that bribes were paid to help them win the 2002 Winter Olympics
Games.
</P>
<P>
   At his Utah Spirit kiosk in the mall, Smedley has been fretting
about the spreading scandal. Everything he sells is emblazoned with
the Olympic logo. Smedley says he isn't worried about business. His
concern is reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought of us as this little Mormon hick place before,
and now we look even worse,'' said Smedley, a lapsed Mormon. ``But
the religious influence here is not as prevalent as people think.
We've got the same bad stuff going on as anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In unexpected ways, the disclosures have laid bare the struggle
within Salt Lake City's soul. Even as residents react to the
allegations with outrage, few appear stunned. The big city came to
Salt Lake years ago, they say, even if its small-town heart tends
to show through in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's upsetting is that we're a nice city; we're Mormons,''
said homemaker Joan Morris. ``This should not happen here. But
we're not naive. We know what goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   While 70 percent of Utahans belong to the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints, less than half of Salt Lake residents do. The
170,000-plus people who live and work here consider themselves
thoroughly modern urbanites. Many, particularly younger people,
resent the state's image as a quaint Mormon backwater whose best
attribute is its snowfall. With 820,000 people in the greater
metropolitan region, they want Salt Lake taken seriously as a
21st-century city.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an undercurrent of morality runs through the response to
the widening scandal. Many Utahans are ready to accept much of the
blame. Few are willing to shoulder all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, they insisted, local boosters handed out cash,
scholarships, and other gifts to officials of the International
Olympic Committee and their relatives only because of lessons
learned. After four failed attempts to win the Olympics, certain
members of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee had come to
understand that bribery _ or, as many people put it, extortion _
was as much a part of the games as the bobsled competition. In
sports circles, observers say, Olympic payoffs have been an open
secret for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned that you either play the game, or you don't get the
games,'' said Reid Jones, a Salt Lake City financial consultant.
``We shouldn't have succumbed, but we did. . . . If we could go
back and do it all over again, I'd like to think we'd walk away
without losing our integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, outcry over the scandal has cost the jobs of two top
officials of the Salt Lake committee. Both men resigned under
pressure last week.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mayor Deedee Corradini abruptly announced that she
would not seek a third term, a decision she called personal and
unrelated to the Olympics. ``This has been horrible for our city,
but we will move on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of investigations are ongoing, and more jobs stand to
be lost from the local to the international level. Utahans want to
see some IOC members expelled. Although no sponsors have pulled out
of the games, fund-raisers who are currently ahead of schedule
worry that many more revelations could cost them sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly galling to Utahans is that it appears Salt Lake had
the votes to win 2002 Winter Games anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Leavitt went on national television to tell America
that the scandal does not represent Utah's values.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people in the international community understand the
gifts and the wining and dining. We went too far. But should you
need a compass to draw the line?'' said Nolan Karras, appointed the
governor's representative on the SLOC after the city's Olympic bid
was secured.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are waiting for the ethics report to see how bad it
is, and then we'll know exactly what we're up against,'' Karras
said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Utahans are promising the best Olympics ever, a
competition that they vow will relegate the scandal to a footnote.
Officials with the local, state and international committees say
the games will go on.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that most people in Utah still support hosting the
Olympics, which will cost the state $59 million for new facilities
and millions more in related expenditures, outlays the state hopes
it will more than earn back in tourist dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Dan Jones said 62 percent of Utahans favored holding
the Olympics in Salt Lake City, up from 53 percent when the scandal
first broke.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, of course, looks forward to the Olympics.
Complaints about road building and construction are ubiquitous, and
concerns about car and tourist traffic in 2002 abound. Stephen
Pace, who heads a small group calling itself Utahns for Responsible
Spending, has opposed public spending on the games, arguing that
taxes could be better spent.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Glenn Bailey wants to ensure that some of the
money is spent on Salt Lake City's needy. His Salt Lake Impact 2002
and Beyond Coalition has been pushing local officials to turn the
athletes' villages into affordable housing when the games conclude.
So far, Bailey said, his group has gotten nowhere with its
campaign, despite Utah's take-care-of-its-own reputation. Now he
hopes the focus on right vs. wrong will gain him access to the
organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   Access, said state Representative Dave Jones, should also mean
immediate public access to every aspect of the Olympic effort. He
wants the local committee's books and meetings open to scrutiny.
Only by doing so, he said, can Salt Lake overcome the adversity it
now faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a setback, but we're no stranger to adversity;
remember the city was founded by pioneers who were run out of other
places,'' Jones said. ``We have the desire and the ability to go
forth and show the world we can do this.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a modern mid-rise a short walk from Big Ben, Reed
Elsevier's management team is bracing for Year Two of perhaps the
most turbulent period in the venture's five-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that Year One -- 1998 -- finally is over.
</P>
<P>
   During the year, Reed Elsevier's run of extraordinary success
ended as the company was buffeted by a variety of challenges as
diverse as the Asian economic crisis and the increased
competitiveness in the U.S. electronic publishing business.
Meanwhile, the company tampered with its corporate strategy -- a
move that required divestiture and huge reinvestment -- while
discarding and replacing the two-headed management structure that
had led to its success.
</P>
<P>
   Now, finding a single chief executive is regarded by many as the
key to navigating the company out of last year's turbulent economic
and market waters.
</P>
<P>
   In early December, that turbulence claimed its price: The
company reported that it expected a hefty 6 percent decrease in
pre-tax profits in 1998 compared to 1997. While analysts knew that
Reed Elsevier was encountering some problems, most were surprised
by the extent of the company's difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew profits would be down,'' Louise Barton, an analyst
with Henderson Crosthwaite, said when the report came out. ``It's
the scale of the downturn that's the surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, one of Europe's most predictable media players was
showing signs of erratic behavior for the first time in its
five-year run. The company, which employs 27,000 people worldwide,
was formed in 1993 in a joint venture of the well-established firms
of Reed International, of London. and Elsevier, headquartered in
Amsterdam. The company has a huge portfolio of business, science
and trade publications such as ``Variety,'' ``Publishers Weekly''
and ``The Lancet.'' The Dayton, Ohio-based company also owns
Lexis-Nexis, the powerhouse electronic service that provides legal
and business information to more than 1.25 million U.S.
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio had performed well, jumping from $1.14 billion in
1995 pre-tax profits to $1.35 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Then came 1998. ``Certainly 1998 was a year of transition,''
Mark Armour, the company's chief financial officer, told the Cox
News Service. ``There were a number of significant issues that
affected the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, chief among these ``issues'' was:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A declining global economy -- particularly in Asia -- softened
demand for the company's business and travel publications;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lexis-Nexis struggled against its chief competitor Thomson
Corp. and its Westlaw online legal services causing
lower-than-expected sales;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Reed Elsevier's decision to pull out of the consumer
publishing business -- a move that led to its selling IPC
Magazines, the leading publisher in Britain with 69 titles
including Marie Clare and TV Times, for $1.4 billion;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And at the same time, the company began pouring money into
electronic publishing, boosting its investment by 20 percent to
about $170 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   All this added up to a sluggish performance for investors and
expressions of concern on the street. The British half of the
Anglo-Dutch partnership, Reed International, was the sixth worst
performer on the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100. Elsevier, the
Dutch half, performed slightly worse on the Dutch exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Armour believes a brief downturn is an acceptable price to pay.
``We have continued to make the investments in products and in our
operating infrastructure in order to position the company well for
a future in which electronic publishing will be an increasingly
important component,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company would have looked better on paper if it had reduced
its investment in electronic publishing, but Armour said that such
a move would not have been in the company's long-term interests.
``It would be very easy to turn the taps off on investments,'' he
said. ``But it's important that we make investments now.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the investments was the acquisition of legal publisher
Matthew Bender &AMP; Co., which is expected to boost Lexis-Nexis and
stem the loss of market share to the more aggressive Thomson.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of tough competition from the Internet, Reed
Elsevier also intends to stabilize declining sales in its travel
publications division -- which include hotel and airline guides --
by spending more on marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, much of the company's fate rests with the
yet-to-be hired chief executive officer, analysts say. In a
generally applauded move, the company in August said it was ending
its double-headed management structure topped by co-chairmen Nigel
Stapleton of Reed and Herman Bruggink of Elsevier in favor of a
more conventional single CEO structure. Both men immediately
withdrew from the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been secretive about the search. ``Don't worry,
when it's time to push the white smoke out, we will let everyone
know,'' Armour said.
</P>
<P>
   However, analysts expect the new CEO to be named before summer,
perhaps before the scheduled March 11 update on the company's 1998
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Because media conglomerates such as Reed Elsevier are entering
new frontiers with electronic publishing, it is acutely important
that the company's leader is capable of performing as a pioneer,
said Meg Geldens, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much change in the industry, mainly technological
change,'' she said. ``You need someone with a good understanding of
how to compete, to deal with the rapid change in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be a difficult job to fill. In addition to the
challenges of operating a global business on the cutting edge, the
company still is governed largely by separate boards in Amsterdam
and London, even though the parent company has a board of its own.
Seeking harmony from three boards of directors will require someone
of considerable political skill and charisma.
</P>
<P>
   The company is thought to be looking for someone with strong
marketing skills to develop the business primarily by improving
sales of its existing brands rather than primarily through
acquisition. ``It's likely to be somebody who has not just
traditional publishing experience,'' Geldens said. ``I wouldn't be
surprised if it's somebody from the Internet or electronic
publishing field. And then again, they could bring somebody from
outside the industry altogether -- a brilliant visionary.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to preserve the sometimes tense Anglo-Dutch
balance in the company, it also is widely speculated that the
company may go with an American chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Richards, an analyst at West LB Panmure, said Reed
Elsevier's best-case scenario would have the new CEO arriving with
a blaze of innovation and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, ``it is much more likely that a new manager
will take six or nine months settling in, there will be drift and
increasingly people will question the investment in electronic
products.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   While no one expects that a new CEO can cause an overnight
turnaround, a smart acquisition or two could improve things
greatly, analysts say. The company suffered a substantial loss of
confidence in the investor community last year when its planned
merger with the Dutch legal publisher Wolters Kluwer foundered on
regulatory grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that deal is truly dead -- and Reed Elsevier says it is
-- the company still sees a number of possible acquisition targets
and has plenty of balance-sheet capacity to pursue them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still an acquisitive company,'' Armour said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that Reed Elsevier itself will be gobbled up by
another company, despite rumors in the fall that Microsoft Corp.
was looking at spending nearly $12 billion to purchase it.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a natural fit: Microsoft supplies Reed Elsevier some
systems support in exchange for some of Reed's information
services.
</P>
<P>
   While Reed Elsevier refuses to comment on what it describes as
``market rumors,'' Microsoft has denied it intended to buy the
company. Analysts generally doubted the deal was for real. ``People
just mention Microsoft because it is one of the few companies big
enough to even discuss buying Reed Elsevier,'' Geldens said.
</P>
<P>
   It also seems unlikely that Reed Elsevier will sell more of its
core businesses, particularly Lexis-Nexis. ``Even though that's one
of the units that is facing some competitive challenges, I think,
at least for the time being, it's part of the family --
particularly with the investment in Matthew Bender.'' Geldens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very balanced portfolio of strong brands,'' said
Armour, who refused to speculate on whether any of the divisions is
likely to be sold any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   While Armour believes that many of the negative factors from
1998 were one-time events, there is no reason to expect a dramatic
change in 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weakening economic conditions will continue to have effects on
our business,'' Armour predicted, adding however, that Reed
Elsevier ``will continue to invest in our businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   And analysts also are looking toward the new millennium for
signs of a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the costly period of investment in electronic publishing
have the desired impact in terms of accelerated revenue growth?''
asked Richard Dale of Salomon Smith Barney. ``The answer, I think,
is it will, but it won't manifest itself until the year 2000.''

<P>
   LONDON _ When Prince Edward's engagement to Sophie Rhys-Jones
was heralded across this imperial island last week, it seemed only
reasonable to expect news clips of Queen Elizabeth passing out
celebratory cigars to the editors of the nation's tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   For both sides, it was a dream come true: A sequel in the great
national saga with a fresh star and at least a fair shot at a happy
ending -- even if it involves what Americans may regard as minor
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Edward, the queen's youngest and least famous son, prefers to be
called Edward Windsor when he is away from the palace and is making
his mark in the world of producing television documentaries. He's
the producer formerly known as prince.
</P>
<P>
   But for a royal household eager for a little good news, the
announcement of engagement to his girlfriend of five years produced
near giddiness.
</P>
<P>
   Royal weddings long have seemed little more than hors d'oeuvre
for the richer and tastier courses of Royal Indiscretions, Royal
Divorces, followed by an even saucier serving of Royal Revelations.
This unhappy, if entertaining cycle has become all too familiar.
And, since the death of Princess Diana in 1997, woefully short of
charming protagonists.
</P>
<P>
   The royal story was growing cold. The tabloids, which were slow
to free Diana from their front pages even a year after her death,
were watching their readers slipping away. With the exception of
the brief joyful spectacle provided them by the Bill Clinton-Monica
Lewinsky affair, the pages lacked star quality.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Sophie.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement captured the front of virtually every tabloid
plus the first seven-to-eight pages inside, which were splayed
gleefully with more Rhys-Jones photos and stories fleshing out
their new star.
</P>
<P>
   In an exquisite twist, this 33-year-old public relations
professional was far from flaky -- already a break from tradition
-- and she was widely proclaimed as relatively ``normal'' -- a word
not often used on the royal beat.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Sensation,'' the tabloid Mirror declared. ``They're happy,
madly in love, and it might just last!''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Mail produced a 12-page ``special souvenir pull-out''
with stories and 49 photos in addition to the four pages in the
main news section. ``Even in this cynical age, few events are more
capable of brightening the gloom of a British winter than the
prospect of a royal wedding,'' the tabloid gushed. ``After years of
turmoil and personal tragedy, perhaps the palace can at last look
forward to a new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   On the evening news -- as the most powerful man in the world was
facing impeachment and removal from office -- the usually
restrained BBC devoted the first 10 minutes of the Six O' Clock
News to the happy couple.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not all of England is so enthralled. The Guardian
newspaper, never a great fan of the royals, stuck the story on page
4, and pleaded for a low-key ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let Elton John fall silent. May the Muse desert the Poet
Laureate,'' the newspaper wrote. ``Spare us the sentimentality this
time around.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Buckingham Palace displayed a rare level of
emotion, describing the queen's reaction to the first royal wedding
since 1992 as ``delighted'' and ``thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   And for good cause: Rhys-Jones could prove the tonic the royals
need to turn the tide of anguish caused by a string of royal
divorces -- each of the queen's other children, Anne, Andrew and
Charles, has endured a much-publicized marriage break-up -- and the
disquieting death of Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Di and the less popular Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of
York, Rhys-Jones does not come from an aristocratic background.
Indeed, far from a fairy tale starlet, Rhys-Jones was raised in a
farmhouse in Kent and never went to a university. Her father is a
former car salesman who later worked for a tire company. She was
described by her friends as somebody who likes to have a few at the
pub and let down her hair.
</P>
<P>
   In short, she has lived in the real, beer-drinking,
dinner-cooking, bill-paying world.
</P>
<P>
   Rhys-Jones is tall and pretty with a full head of blonde hair,
enough to cause a passerby to get an initial sense of deja vu at
seeing her photo on the front of the tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at 33 and with five years experience at being the Royal
Girlfriend, she offers a far different persona than the shy and
dreamy-eyed 20-year-old girl Diana was when she married Prince
Charles in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obvious reminders of the late princess, it is
unlikely that Rhys-Jones could fill the void in the hearts of the
Diana faithful. Una-Mary Parker, a royal writer and expert, told
the BBC that no one could replace Diana, no matter how much the
press yearned for another royal star.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Rhys-Jones) does emulate Diana in many ways with her clothes
and her hair, but it is not going to work,'' Parker said. ``The
public won't buy another Diana. There was only one.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Rhys-Jones has made it clear she intends to be
anything but Princess Di II, even suggesting in some reports that
she will not seek the title of princess.
</P>
<P>
   And her debut as fiancee couldn't have been more different than
Diana's shy, even frightened performance a decade ago. As
Rhys-Jones parked her burgundy sedan outside her public relations
firm in central London the morning after the news broke, she found
the sidewalk filled with reporters and cameras. She smiled and
appeared relaxed as she stepped out of her car with a police
escort.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced at public relations, she was careful not to ignore
the press or dismiss them with responses of ``No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   No, she had no intention of giving up her business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have set this company up and I have commitments to clients
and staff, and I want to carry that on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What would it be like being part of a royal marriage?
</P>
<P>
   ``I will see about that when it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Is she looking forward to the media microscope?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray Harkin, her business partner, predicted she'll remain
cool under the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows the media inside out, so I think that is going to
help her with some of the pressures she is obviously going to be
under in the next couple of months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rhys-Jones met Edward at the Queen's Tennis Club in London in
1993 and they began dating soon afterward. She has spent weekends
and holidays with him at the queen's homes at Balmoral in Scotland
and Sandringham in eastern England, and from time to time has lived
in his royal apartments at Buckingham Palace.
</P>
<P>
   At a photo session at St. James's Palace after the announcement,
she frequently threw back her head in laughter and seemed warm and
confident with Edward, who presented her an engagement ring
featuring a 2-carat diamond flanked by two smaller heart-shaped
ones.
</P>
<P>
   She admitted that she found the prospect of joining the royal
family ``slightly nerve-wracking'' but gave every impression of
being able to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   Getting married is a very personal thing,'' she told reporters.
``Naturally, there is going to be more interest in us than in other
people, but it is a personal matter and a family occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple hope to marry in St. George's Chapel at Windsor in
late spring or early summer. A date has yet not been set. They'll
live in Bagshot Park, a sprawling estate in Surrey built by Queen
Victoria for her favorite son, Prince Arthur. Edward leased the
estate in 1997 to house his business, Ardent Productions.
</P>
<P>
   In the family tradition, Edward had entered the military after
graduating from Cambridge, but in a show of independence he quit
the commando course of the Royal Marines in 1987, resigned his
commission and returned to civilian life to pursue a career in the
theater. He started as a production assistant for Andrew Lloyd
Webber's Really Useful Company, doing backstage jobs at the
musicals ``Cats,'' ``Starlight Express'' and ``Phantom of the
Opera'' in the West End theater district. In 1992, he and friends
set up a theater production company, which collapsed a year later,
$1 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   His company's biggest successes have been with royal subjects,
one the story of his great-uncle Edward VIII called ``Edward on
Edward;'' another a series called ``Crown and Country,'' which was
shown on PBS in the United States in September and will reappear in
a sequel in February; and ``Windsor Restored,'' the documentary on
the $61 million project to resurrect Windsor Castle after the 1992
fire.
</P>
<P>
   After years of incessant questioning about his intentions with
Rhys-Jones, Edward proposed before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I managed to take her completely by surprise,'' he said. ``She
had no idea it was coming, which was what I really wanted to do.
The trouble is everybody always speculating always made it very
difficult. Every time there was another round of speculation I had
to go very quiet again.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhys-Jones said she was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I suddenly realized I should actually answer the
question,'' she said. ``So then I said, 'Yes, yes, please.' ``

`60 MINUTES II' LACKS DEPTH OF ORIGINAL'S MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
60 MINUTES II 
Produced by Jeff Fager 
CBS, 9-10 p.m., Wednesday
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``60 Minutes'' is the only program in television history to be
rated No. 1 in the Nielsen ratings in three consecutive decades _
the '70s, '80s, and '90s. It's a billion-dollar franchise that, in
some years, brought in nearly 50 percent of CBS's TV revenue. When
``Entertainment Weekly'' named its 100 greatest TV shows of all
time, ``60 Minutes'' was in the top 20. Most of all, it practiced
tough television journalism before the concept began sounding like
an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night at 9, ``60 Minutes II,'' the Wednesday evening
edition, debuted with a separate cast and crew from its Sunday
original but with the same mission. And, while it didn't live up to
the hype, their ticking clock isn't the time bomb that some
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The format is basically the same. Each week reporters _ drawn
from the team of foreign correspondent Bob Simon, interviewer
Charlie Rose, London correspondent Vicki Mabrey, and Carol Marin,
the woman who gained national attention when she resigned from a
Chicago TV station when they hired Jerry Springer _ will report
three major stories. Producer Jeff Fager also includes what's
called a ``60 Minutes'' classic, actually a follow-up story to an
earlier ``60 Minutes'' broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday night's hour, Mike Wallace returned to a
heartbreaking story of the abandoned daughter of an American father
and Vietnamese mother who Wallace first met in 1982 when she was 6
years old. His report had a happy ending, but Wallace failed to
explain the intricate diplomatic details that resulted in her
reunion with her parents. It was closer to ``This Is Your Life''
than ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The profile of David Schippers, the Chicago Democrat who helped
spearhead the impeachment of President Clinton, wasn't much either.
The bearded moralist who once studied for the priesthood explained,
in no uncertain terms, why President Clinton should be impeached.
We didn't get much more of Schippers's political philosophy than we
got from his testamony during the impeachment proceedings. What's
his family like? What do they think? What about other Chicago
Democrats? No answers, just a response from U.S. Representative
Barney Frank (D-Mass.) about right-wing conspiracies. It's all been
said and heard before.
</P>
<P>
   Even the lead story on a plutonium mine in Russia which,
according to American emissary Bill Richardson, is a serious threat
to international security, didn't make much of an impact. At the
risk of appearing provincial, Massachusetts-born Jimmy Tingle's
commentary _ much of it from his one-man show ``Uncommon Sense'' _
effectively pointed out the hypocritical contradictions of American
policy. His remarks about the media fleeing the Pope's trip to Cuba
to cover the White House sex scandal said more about the nation's
current affairs than all of the show's other stories combined.
</P>
<P>
   One of the characteristics that made ``60 Minutes'' so special
is that it worked harder to dig deeper into stories. It's a method
that the new edition should take seriously. Instead of settling for
the sort of stories we saw Wednesday night _ stories suitable for
ABC's ``20/20'' or NBC's ``Dateline'' _ we need something more if
``60 Minutes II'' is to enrich the ``60 Minutes'' franchise.

 &HT;    CHINESE LEADERS EXPECTING AN UNUSUALLY DANGEROUS YEAR
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (k) Commentary
categories.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Jan. 17 And Thereafter.

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ ``Study, study, and study again,'' Chinese President
Jiang Zemin admonished his high-ranking listeners behind the gates
of the Central Committee Party School.
</P>
<P>
   For seven days, China's ruling elite sat at the head of
glorified classrooms on the northern fringe of Beijing and lectured
senior Communist Party officials from across China. The party
``could lose the support of the Chinese people'' if it doesn't
perform better, Jiang said in his final summation on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Committee's Party School, near the old imperial
Summer Palace, is a main drivewheel of the Communist Party's
ideological transmission belt to the heartland. In coming weeks,
audiences from the top-level retreat can be expected to drum out
the same jarring warnings to thousands of lower-ranking cadres at
the network of regional party schools scattered nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three weeks, Jiang's message, both in public and
private, has been that 1999 looms as an unusually dangerous year
for the internal stability of China and its 53 million-member
ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever any element that undermines stability raises its
head, it must be resolutely nipped in the bud,'' as Jiang put it in
a chilling televised warning to his countrymen on Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jiang never said so out loud, China's leaders are clearly
nervous as they face a calendar jammed with politically sensitive
anniversaries in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Tibetan dissidents will lament the 40th anniversary of
the abortive uprising that led to the exile of the Dalai Lama. On
June 4, pro-democracy advocates now in exile, and perhaps some
inside China, will bemoan the 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen
Square massacre. Then on October 1, China will glorify 50 years
under communist rule, an occasion that may require soul-searching
by party leaders about whether to de-mythologize their brutal and
erratic founding father, the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung.
</P>
<P>
   A deeper source of worry is that after 20 years, China's rocket
burst of economic growth is finally showing signs of flaming out.
As growth slows, there are likely to be fewer and fewer new jobs to
satisfy tens of millions of laid-off urban workers and able-bodied
villagers no longer needed on the farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Weighed down by the Asian economic crisis, its own dinosaur
state industries and its barely solvent banking system, China has
seen its growth rates gradually dip from spectacular double-digits
in the early 1990s to 9.6 percent in 1996, 8.8 percent in 1997, and
no more than 7.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, even optimists are expecting growth to slide further
-- with unpleasant consequences. ``At present, our economy hasn't
reached the trough,'' said Beijing University professor Zhang Xue
Bin in an interview with the Cox News Service. ``It is possible
that our economic growth rate will become even lower this year.
Therefore, it is possible that more people will be laid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang's recently-published book, whose title in English is ``The
Danger Time of the Reform,'' warns that China faces a ``battle of
decisive significance.'' Four critical dangers that have not been
well-addressed, he wrote, are ``social chaos'' arising from poverty
in the countryside, ``very serious'' official corruption, a drop in
the economic growth rate and growing critiques by communist
hard-liners opposed to reform.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, China unleashed an emergency three-year, $1.2
trillion package of highway, dam and other government construction
projects in an effort reminiscent of the American New Deal
pump-priming to head off a full-scale economic slump. But even the
government's loyal academic experts like Zhang wonder whether China
can spend enough to head off restiveness among more than 20 million
laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, China's economic stimulus plan has placed extra
financial pressures on the nation's already thinly capitalized
state banks, notes Nicholas Lardy, a China expert at the Brookings
Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have purchased higher growth in the short run at the
price of a larger problem of bank recapitalization in the future,''
Lardy said in an e-mail interview with Cox News Service. ``And
postponing dealing with the underlying problems in the financial
sector increases the risk that there will be a financial meltdown.
The risk is probably still low but the key thing is that it is
rising.''
</P>
<P>
   As has often happened in the last half-century when Beijing's
leaders felt threatened by economic or other internal difficulties,
they reacted last month by ordering a crackdown on the latest
sproutings of political dissent within the intellectual elite.
</P>
<P>
   Their chief target was the China Democracy Party, a would-be
opposition political party with a few hundred armchair activists.
Though it had achieved some notice among Westerners by trying to
register as an approved political party, it posed no perceptible
threat to the communist party's grip on power. It had attracted
virtually no attention among ordinary Chinese, largely because the
official media never covered it.
</P>
<P>
   Harmless or not, on December 21, a Chinese court imposed an
11-year prison sentence on Wang Youcai, the 32-year-old activist
who last summer petitioned authorities to register the China
Democracy Party as an official entity. Wang, who had also
participated as an obscure student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen
Square uprising, was convicted in a blare of publicity of
``attempting to overthrow state power.''
</P>
<P>
   At least five other organizers were quickly imprisoned, and five
others were placed under house arrest or in police custody. Two
identifiable leaders -- Xu Wenli, 55, and Qin Yongmin, 45, both
veterans of the abortive Democracy Wall protests of the late 1970s
-- were given sentences of 13 and 12 years after hasty, heavily
publicized trials.
</P>
<P>
   By Chinese standards, perhaps the most curious aspect of the
crackdown was that the authorities went out of their way to call
attention to the dissidents through heavy publicity about their
punishments. It was as if the communist hierarchy wanted to signal
other potential troublemakers that this is a year when even the
mildest forms of protest will not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that the government was not terribly
worried about a few dissidents saying things to each other,'' said
Boston University's China watcher Joseph Fewsmith, who was in
Beijing for meetings with Chinese academic colleagues. ``What they
(the government) are terribly worried about is the prospect of a
few dissidents trying to organize laid-off workers. That is the
sort of thing they really want to nip in the bud.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a modern mid-rise a short walk from Big Ben, Reed
Elsevier's management team is bracing for Year Two of perhaps the
most turbulent period in the venture's five-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that Year One -- 1998 -- finally is over.
</P>
<P>
   During the year, Reed Elsevier's run of extraordinary success
ended as the company was buffeted by a variety of challenges as
diverse as the Asian economic crisis and the increased
competitiveness in the U.S. electronic publishing business.
Meanwhile, the company tampered with its corporate strategy -- a
move that required divestiture and huge reinvestment -- while
discarding and replacing the two-headed management structure that
had led to its success.
</P>
<P>
   Now, finding a single chief executive is regarded by many as the
key to navigating the company out of last year's turbulent economic
and market waters.
</P>
<P>
   In early December, that turbulence claimed its price: The
company reported that it expected a hefty 6 percent decrease in
pre-tax profits in 1998 compared to 1997. While analysts knew that
Reed Elsevier was encountering some problems, most were surprised
by the extent of the company's difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew profits would be down,'' Louise Barton, an analyst
with Henderson Crosthwaite, said when the report came out. ``It's
the scale of the downturn that's the surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, one of Europe's most predictable media players was
showing signs of erratic behavior for the first time in its
five-year run. The company, which employs 27,000 people worldwide,
was formed in 1993 in a joint venture of the well-established firms
of Reed International, of London. and Elsevier, headquartered in
Amsterdam. The company has a huge portfolio of business, science
and trade publications such as ``Variety,'' ``Publishers Weekly''
and ``The Lancet.'' The Dayton, Ohio-based company also owns
Lexis-Nexis, the powerhouse electronic service that provides legal
and business information to more than 1.25 million U.S.
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio had performed well, jumping from $1.14 billion in
1995 pre-tax profits to $1.35 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Then came 1998. ``Certainly 1998 was a year of transition,''
Mark Armour, the company's chief financial officer, told the Cox
News Service. ``There were a number of significant issues that
affected the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, chief among these ``issues'' was:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A declining global economy -- particularly in Asia -- softened
demand for the company's business and travel publications;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lexis-Nexis struggled against its chief competitor Thomson
Corp. and its Westlaw online legal services causing
lower-than-expected sales;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Reed Elsevier's decision to pull out of the consumer
publishing business -- a move that led to its selling IPC
Magazines, the leading publisher in Britain with 69 titles
including Marie Clare and TV Times, for $1.4 billion;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And at the same time, the company began pouring money into
electronic publishing, boosting its investment by 20 percent to
about $170 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   All this added up to a sluggish performance for investors and
expressions of concern on the street. The British half of the
Anglo-Dutch partnership, Reed International, was the sixth worst
performer on the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100. Elsevier, the
Dutch half, performed slightly worse on the Dutch exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Armour believes a brief downturn is an acceptable price to pay.
``We have continued to make the investments in products and in our
operating infrastructure in order to position the company well for
a future in which electronic publishing will be an increasingly
important component,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company would have looked better on paper if it had reduced
its investment in electronic publishing, but Armour said that such
a move would not have been in the company's long-term interests.
``It would be very easy to turn the taps off on investments,'' he
said. ``But it's important that we make investments now.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the investments was the acquisition of legal publisher
Matthew Bender &AMP; Co., which is expected to boost Lexis-Nexis and
stem the loss of market share to the more aggressive Thomson.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of tough competition from the Internet, Reed
Elsevier also intends to stabilize declining sales in its travel
publications division -- which include hotel and airline guides --
by spending more on marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, much of the company's fate rests with the
yet-to-be hired chief executive officer, analysts say. In a
generally applauded move, the company in August said it was ending
its double-headed management structure topped by co-chairmen Nigel
Stapleton of Reed and Herman Bruggink of Elsevier in favor of a
more conventional single CEO structure. Both men immediately
withdrew from the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been secretive about the search. ``Don't worry,
when it's time to push the white smoke out, we will let everyone
know,'' Armour said.
</P>
<P>
   However, analysts expect the new CEO to be named before summer,
perhaps before the scheduled March 11 update on the company's 1998
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Because media conglomerates such as Reed Elsevier are entering
new frontiers with electronic publishing, it is acutely important
that the company's leader is capable of performing as a pioneer,
said Meg Geldens, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much change in the industry, mainly technological
change,'' she said. ``You need someone with a good understanding of
how to compete, to deal with the rapid change in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be a difficult job to fill. In addition to the
challenges of operating a global business on the cutting edge, the
company still is governed largely by separate boards in Amsterdam
and London, even though the parent company has a board of its own.
Seeking harmony from three boards of directors will require someone
of considerable political skill and charisma.
</P>
<P>
   The company is thought to be looking for someone with strong
marketing skills to develop the business primarily by improving
sales of its existing brands rather than primarily through
acquisition. ``It's likely to be somebody who has not just
traditional publishing experience,'' Geldens said. ``I wouldn't be
surprised if it's somebody from the Internet or electronic
publishing field. And then again, they could bring somebody from
outside the industry altogether -- a brilliant visionary.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to preserve the sometimes tense Anglo-Dutch
balance in the company, it also is widely speculated that the
company may go with an American chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Richards, an analyst at West LB Panmure, said Reed
Elsevier's best-case scenario would have the new CEO arriving with
a blaze of innovation and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, ``it is much more likely that a new manager
will take six or nine months settling in, there will be drift and
increasingly people will question the investment in electronic
products.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   While no one expects that a new CEO can cause an overnight
turnaround, a smart acquisition or two could improve things
greatly, analysts say. The company suffered a substantial loss of
confidence in the investor community last year when its planned
merger with the Dutch legal publisher Wolters Kluwer foundered on
regulatory grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that deal is truly dead -- and Reed Elsevier says it is
-- the company still sees a number of possible acquisition targets
and has plenty of balance-sheet capacity to pursue them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still an acquisitive company,'' Armour said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that Reed Elsevier itself will be gobbled up by
another company, despite rumors in the fall that Microsoft Corp.
was looking at spending nearly $12 billion to purchase it.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a natural fit: Microsoft supplies Reed Elsevier some
systems support in exchange for some of Reed's information
services.
</P>
<P>
   While Reed Elsevier refuses to comment on what it describes as
``market rumors,'' Microsoft has denied it intended to buy the
company. Analysts generally doubted the deal was for real. ``People
just mention Microsoft because it is one of the few companies big
enough to even discuss buying Reed Elsevier,'' Geldens said.
</P>
<P>
   It also seems unlikely that Reed Elsevier will sell more of its
core businesses, particularly Lexis-Nexis. ``Even though that's one
of the units that is facing some competitive challenges, I think,
at least for the time being, it's part of the family --
particularly with the investment in Matthew Bender.'' Geldens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very balanced portfolio of strong brands,'' said
Armour, who refused to speculate on whether any of the divisions is
likely to be sold any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   While Armour believes that many of the negative factors from
1998 were one-time events, there is no reason to expect a dramatic
change in 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weakening economic conditions will continue to have effects on
our business,'' Armour predicted, adding however, that Reed
Elsevier ``will continue to invest in our businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   And analysts also are looking toward the new millennium for
signs of a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the costly period of investment in electronic publishing
have the desired impact in terms of accelerated revenue growth?''
asked Richard Dale of Salomon Smith Barney. ``The answer, I think,
is it will, but it won't manifest itself until the year 2000.''

<P>
   LONDON _ When Prince Edward's engagement to Sophie Rhys-Jones
was heralded across this imperial island last week, it seemed only
reasonable to expect news clips of Queen Elizabeth passing out
celebratory cigars to the editors of the nation's tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   For both sides, it was a dream come true: A sequel in the great
national saga with a fresh star and at least a fair shot at a happy
ending -- even if it involves what Americans may regard as minor
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Edward, the queen's youngest and least famous son, prefers to be
called Edward Windsor when he is away from the palace and is making
his mark in the world of producing television documentaries. He's
the producer formerly known as prince.
</P>
<P>
   But for a royal household eager for a little good news, the
announcement of engagement to his girlfriend of five years produced
near giddiness.
</P>
<P>
   Royal weddings long have seemed little more than hors d'oeuvre
for the richer and tastier courses of Royal Indiscretions, Royal
Divorces, followed by an even saucier serving of Royal Revelations.
This unhappy, if entertaining cycle has become all too familiar.
And, since the death of Princess Diana in 1997, woefully short of
charming protagonists.
</P>
<P>
   The royal story was growing cold. The tabloids, which were slow
to free Diana from their front pages even a year after her death,
were watching their readers slipping away. With the exception of
the brief joyful spectacle provided them by the Bill Clinton-Monica
Lewinsky affair, the pages lacked star quality.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Sophie.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement captured the front of virtually every tabloid
plus the first seven-to-eight pages inside, which were splayed
gleefully with more Rhys-Jones photos and stories fleshing out
their new star.
</P>
<P>
   In an exquisite twist, this 33-year-old public relations
professional was far from flaky -- already a break from tradition
-- and she was widely proclaimed as relatively ``normal'' -- a word
not often used on the royal beat.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Sensation,'' the tabloid Mirror declared. ``They're happy,
madly in love, and it might just last!''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Mail produced a 12-page ``special souvenir pull-out''
with stories and 49 photos in addition to the four pages in the
main news section. ``Even in this cynical age, few events are more
capable of brightening the gloom of a British winter than the
prospect of a royal wedding,'' the tabloid gushed. ``After years of
turmoil and personal tragedy, perhaps the palace can at last look
forward to a new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   On the evening news -- as the most powerful man in the world was
facing impeachment and removal from office -- the usually
restrained BBC devoted the first 10 minutes of the Six O' Clock
News to the happy couple.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not all of England is so enthralled. The Guardian
newspaper, never a great fan of the royals, stuck the story on page
4, and pleaded for a low-key ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let Elton John fall silent. May the Muse desert the Poet
Laureate,'' the newspaper wrote. ``Spare us the sentimentality this
time around.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Buckingham Palace displayed a rare level of
emotion, describing the queen's reaction to the first royal wedding
since 1992 as ``delighted'' and ``thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   And for good cause: Rhys-Jones could prove the tonic the royals
need to turn the tide of anguish caused by a string of royal
divorces -- each of the queen's other children, Anne, Andrew and
Charles, has endured a much-publicized marriage break-up -- and the
disquieting death of Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Di and the less popular Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of
York, Rhys-Jones does not come from an aristocratic background.
Indeed, far from a fairy tale starlet, Rhys-Jones was raised in a
farmhouse in Kent and never went to a university. Her father is a
former car salesman who later worked for a tire company. She was
described by her friends as somebody who likes to have a few at the
pub and let down her hair.
</P>
<P>
   In short, she has lived in the real, beer-drinking,
dinner-cooking, bill-paying world.
</P>
<P>
   Rhys-Jones is tall and pretty with a full head of blonde hair,
enough to cause a passerby to get an initial sense of deja vu at
seeing her photo on the front of the tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at 33 and with five years experience at being the Royal
Girlfriend, she offers a far different persona than the shy and
dreamy-eyed 20-year-old girl Diana was when she married Prince
Charles in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obvious reminders of the late princess, it is
unlikely that Rhys-Jones could fill the void in the hearts of the
Diana faithful. Una-Mary Parker, a royal writer and expert, told
the BBC that no one could replace Diana, no matter how much the
press yearned for another royal star.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Rhys-Jones) does emulate Diana in many ways with her clothes
and her hair, but it is not going to work,'' Parker said. ``The
public won't buy another Diana. There was only one.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Rhys-Jones has made it clear she intends to be
anything but Princess Di II, even suggesting in some reports that
she will not seek the title of princess.
</P>
<P>
   And her debut as fiancee couldn't have been more different than
Diana's shy, even frightened performance a decade ago. As
Rhys-Jones parked her burgundy sedan outside her public relations
firm in central London the morning after the news broke, she found
the sidewalk filled with reporters and cameras. She smiled and
appeared relaxed as she stepped out of her car with a police
escort.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced at public relations, she was careful not to ignore
the press or dismiss them with responses of ``No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   No, she had no intention of giving up her business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have set this company up and I have commitments to clients
and staff, and I want to carry that on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What would it be like being part of a royal marriage?
</P>
<P>
   ``I will see about that when it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Is she looking forward to the media microscope?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray Harkin, her business partner, predicted she'll remain
cool under the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows the media inside out, so I think that is going to
help her with some of the pressures she is obviously going to be
under in the next couple of months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rhys-Jones met Edward at the Queen's Tennis Club in London in
1993 and they began dating soon afterward. She has spent weekends
and holidays with him at the queen's homes at Balmoral in Scotland
and Sandringham in eastern England, and from time to time has lived
in his royal apartments at Buckingham Palace.
</P>
<P>
   At a photo session at St. James's Palace after the announcement,
she frequently threw back her head in laughter and seemed warm and
confident with Edward, who presented her an engagement ring
featuring a 2-carat diamond flanked by two smaller heart-shaped
ones.
</P>
<P>
   She admitted that she found the prospect of joining the royal
family ``slightly nerve-wracking'' but gave every impression of
being able to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   Getting married is a very personal thing,'' she told reporters.
``Naturally, there is going to be more interest in us than in other
people, but it is a personal matter and a family occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple hope to marry in St. George's Chapel at Windsor in
late spring or early summer. A date has yet not been set. They'll
live in Bagshot Park, a sprawling estate in Surrey built by Queen
Victoria for her favorite son, Prince Arthur. Edward leased the
estate in 1997 to house his business, Ardent Productions.
</P>
<P>
   In the family tradition, Edward had entered the military after
graduating from Cambridge, but in a show of independence he quit
the commando course of the Royal Marines in 1987, resigned his
commission and returned to civilian life to pursue a career in the
theater. He started as a production assistant for Andrew Lloyd
Webber's Really Useful Company, doing backstage jobs at the
musicals ``Cats,'' ``Starlight Express'' and ``Phantom of the
Opera'' in the West End theater district. In 1992, he and friends
set up a theater production company, which collapsed a year later,
$1 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   His company's biggest successes have been with royal subjects,
one the story of his great-uncle Edward VIII called ``Edward on
Edward;'' another a series called ``Crown and Country,'' which was
shown on PBS in the United States in September and will reappear in
a sequel in February; and ``Windsor Restored,'' the documentary on
the $61 million project to resurrect Windsor Castle after the 1992
fire.
</P>
<P>
   After years of incessant questioning about his intentions with
Rhys-Jones, Edward proposed before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I managed to take her completely by surprise,'' he said. ``She
had no idea it was coming, which was what I really wanted to do.
The trouble is everybody always speculating always made it very
difficult. Every time there was another round of speculation I had
to go very quiet again.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhys-Jones said she was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I suddenly realized I should actually answer the
question,'' she said. ``So then I said, 'Yes, yes, please.' ``

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ ``Study, study, and study again,'' Chinese President
Jiang Zemin admonished his high-ranking listeners behind the gates
of the Central Committee Party School.
</P>
<P>
   For seven days, China's ruling elite sat at the head of
glorified classrooms on the northern fringe of Beijing and lectured
senior Communist Party officials from across China. The party
``could lose the support of the Chinese people'' if it doesn't
perform better, Jiang said in his final summation on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Committee's Party School, near the old imperial
Summer Palace, is a main drivewheel of the Communist Party's
ideological transmission belt to the heartland. In coming weeks,
audiences from the top-level retreat can be expected to drum out
the same jarring warnings to thousands of lower-ranking cadres at
the network of regional party schools scattered nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three weeks, Jiang's message, both in public and
private, has been that 1999 looms as an unusually dangerous year
for the internal stability of China and its 53 million-member
ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever any element that undermines stability raises its
head, it must be resolutely nipped in the bud,'' as Jiang put it in
a chilling televised warning to his countrymen on Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jiang never said so out loud, China's leaders are clearly
nervous as they face a calendar jammed with politically sensitive
anniversaries in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Tibetan dissidents will lament the 40th anniversary of
the abortive uprising that led to the exile of the Dalai Lama. On
June 4, pro-democracy advocates now in exile, and perhaps some
inside China, will bemoan the 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen
Square massacre. Then on October 1, China will glorify 50 years
under communist rule, an occasion that may require soul-searching
by party leaders about whether to de-mythologize their brutal and
erratic founding father, the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung.
</P>
<P>
   A deeper source of worry is that after 20 years, China's rocket
burst of economic growth is finally showing signs of flaming out.
As growth slows, there are likely to be fewer and fewer new jobs to
satisfy tens of millions of laid-off urban workers and able-bodied
villagers no longer needed on the farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Weighed down by the Asian economic crisis, its own dinosaur
state industries and its barely solvent banking system, China has
seen its growth rates gradually dip from spectacular double-digits
in the early 1990s to 9.6 percent in 1996, 8.8 percent in 1997, and
no more than 7.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, even optimists are expecting growth to slide further
-- with unpleasant consequences. ``At present, our economy hasn't
reached the trough,'' said Beijing University professor Zhang Xue
Bin in an interview with the Cox News Service. ``It is possible
that our economic growth rate will become even lower this year.
Therefore, it is possible that more people will be laid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang's recently-published book, whose title in English is ``The
Danger Time of the Reform,'' warns that China faces a ``battle of
decisive significance.'' Four critical dangers that have not been
well-addressed, he wrote, are ``social chaos'' arising from poverty
in the countryside, ``very serious'' official corruption, a drop in
the economic growth rate and growing critiques by communist
hard-liners opposed to reform.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, China unleashed an emergency three-year, $1.2
trillion package of highway, dam and other government construction
projects in an effort reminiscent of the American New Deal
pump-priming to head off a full-scale economic slump. But even the
government's loyal academic experts like Zhang wonder whether China
can spend enough to head off restiveness among more than 20 million
laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, China's economic stimulus plan has placed extra
financial pressures on the nation's already thinly capitalized
state banks, notes Nicholas Lardy, a China expert at the Brookings
Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have purchased higher growth in the short run at the
price of a larger problem of bank recapitalization in the future,''
Lardy said in an e-mail interview with Cox News Service. ``And
postponing dealing with the underlying problems in the financial
sector increases the risk that there will be a financial meltdown.
The risk is probably still low but the key thing is that it is
rising.''
</P>
<P>
   As has often happened in the last half-century when Beijing's
leaders felt threatened by economic or other internal difficulties,
they reacted last month by ordering a crackdown on the latest
sproutings of political dissent within the intellectual elite.
</P>
<P>
   Their chief target was the China Democracy Party, a would-be
opposition political party with a few hundred armchair activists.
Though it had achieved some notice among Westerners by trying to
register as an approved political party, it posed no perceptible
threat to the communist party's grip on power. It had attracted
virtually no attention among ordinary Chinese, largely because the
official media never covered it.
</P>
<P>
   Harmless or not, on December 21, a Chinese court imposed an
11-year prison sentence on Wang Youcai, the 32-year-old activist
who last summer petitioned authorities to register the China
Democracy Party as an official entity. Wang, who had also
participated as an obscure student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen
Square uprising, was convicted in a blare of publicity of
``attempting to overthrow state power.''
</P>
<P>
   At least five other organizers were quickly imprisoned, and five
others were placed under house arrest or in police custody. Two
identifiable leaders -- Xu Wenli, 55, and Qin Yongmin, 45, both
veterans of the abortive Democracy Wall protests of the late 1970s
-- were given sentences of 13 and 12 years after hasty, heavily
publicized trials.
</P>
<P>
   By Chinese standards, perhaps the most curious aspect of the
crackdown was that the authorities went out of their way to call
attention to the dissidents through heavy publicity about their
punishments. It was as if the communist hierarchy wanted to signal
other potential troublemakers that this is a year when even the
mildest forms of protest will not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that the government was not terribly
worried about a few dissidents saying things to each other,'' said
Boston University's China watcher Joseph Fewsmith, who was in
Beijing for meetings with Chinese academic colleagues. ``What they
(the government) are terribly worried about is the prospect of a
few dissidents trying to organize laid-off workers. That is the
sort of thing they really want to nip in the bud.''

GROWING UP IN CHINA'S TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
DAUGHTER OF THE RIVER 
An Autobiography 
By Hong Ying; translated, from the Chinese, by Howard Goldblatt 
Grove Press, 278 pp., illustrated, $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One important thing distinguishes Hong Ying's memoir, ``Daughter
of the River,'' from the flood of accounts of growing up in the
People's Republic of China. Unlike virtually all other memoir
writers whose works have appeared in the West _ the children of
privileged members of the Communist elite _ Hong Ying comes from an
urban peasant family. Her mother, the wife of a disabled stevedore,
worked as a coolie, ``an hourly laborer, struggling with a carrying
pole and two lengths of rope,'' up and down the steep gullies that
led to the docks.
</P>
<P>
   The family, including Hong Ying and five siblings, lived in the
South Bank slums of Chongqing, ``the city's garbage dump, an
unsalvageable slum,'' whose stench and filth prompt Hong Ying to
wonder why the people living there were ``punished by having noses
on their faces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Daughter of the River'' is a grim, grubby immersion in the
suffering of China's urban underclass during the years following
the Great Famine of the early 1960s. Hong Ying is a novelist: Her
1997 novel ``Summer of Betrayal'' looked at the Tiananmen Square
demonstrations through the eyes of avant-garde artists, and she can
produce scenes of stark power.
</P>
<P>
   She compels the reader to share her fright and disgust as she
vomits up a gray, foot-long roundworm one day as she is about to
eat a bowl of boiled rice and red beans. And, most macabre, she
tells of ``water clubs,'' when the sight of dead bodies being swept
down the Yangtze would bring ``rare entertainment (into) the drab
daily lives of South Bank residents.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is ultimately disappointing that Hong Ying is more
interested in her own coming-of-age story, almost to the point of
self-absorption, than in the world around her.
</P>
<P>
   The central figures in her story are Hong Ying's history
teacher, with whom a schoolgirl crush develops into a one-night
stand (which leads to an aborted pregnancy and the teacher's
suicide), and her natural father. If the affair with the teacher
seems Western in the telling, the account of the lurking presence
and eventual discovery of her natural father links the turmoil in
Hong Ying's personal life with the social turbulence that lay
heavily over China during the years of her growing up.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Hong Ying often felt that she was being stalked (and
later, in her dreams, wondered if the stalker was the fantasized
teacher). But on her 18th birthday, Hong Ying's mother tells her
that after she had gone to work as a coolie when her husband was
hospitalized following a shipboard accident, she fell in love with
a younger man who had befriended her and her five children. Hong
Ying was their child.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Ying's mother arranged for her to meet the man, now married
and living in the countryside near Chongqing. They have dinner and
go to a movie together, and then sit in a pavilion above the river
where with great tenderness he tells her about his life since her
birth. But she resists his efforts to become close to her. Hong
Ying tells him to stop following her and that she does not want to
see him again. ``I still couldn't swallow how (he and her mother)
had imposed their arrangement on me, keeping me in the dark for all
those years.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffeted emotionally by the meeting with her father and the
suicide of her teacher, Hong Ying leaves Chongqing and spends
several years drifting around the country. She returns to visit and
concludes her memoir with a suggestion that she has come to
understand other people and herself.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother gives her a harmonica that had belonged to her father
and tells Hong Ying of his death. Finally, she realizes how she had
been ``the center of his emotional life right up until the day he
died,'' while she had ``tossed him aside without a second thought,
unwilling even to turn back for one last look'' that evening in the
pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   In telling Hong Ying about his experiences during the famine
years, her history teacher had said, ``Every family's story was
more or less the same, I think. But in the telling they were all
different.'' It is a comment that applies to Hong Ying's memoir. If
every family's story is not quite like that of every other,
certainly the way they are told separates one from another. Hong
Ying has chosen to tell of her family's life and the sufferings of
her country as a backdrop for her own. The result, if something of
a missed opportunity, is a deeply emotional memoir.

WINTER SEASON A TIME TO DREAM OF GARDENS TO COME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   January is spiritual. In full retreat from its steely cold, we
flee indoors and huddle, mentally, before the flame of springtime
garden hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Snowy sheets draping lawns and gardens and fields and woods can
form an intellectual tabula rasa. Ponder how the jumble of brambles
and scrub that you mean to remove also is home and haven to small
birds that swarm the feeders in waves. Weigh the uncompleted tasks
of last year against fresh ideas. Traipse the paths and study the
garden framework, a bare, stark presentation of shrubs and dead
foliage interspersed with evergreens and brightened with berries.
</P>
<P>
   I was told in a class on trees that winter is the best time to
study them because, when they're in leaf, you can't see the trees
for the forest. And so this is an opportunity to do some planning,
between winter dreaming. Frozen hands write grudgingly, but
notebook and pencil should accompany excursions outside.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly I realize that the oversized coreopsis will fit in
better next year when the baptisias behind it are bigger and an
adjacent ``Snow'' chamaecyparis spreads out and up. I started that
false cypress from a stem cutting taken at the Arnold Arboretum,
and I am unclear on just how large it will get. I know that the
Thujopsis dolobrata ``Variegata'' a short distance away, a false
arborvitae also begun as a cutting, will top 30 feet someday. (It
also will get chopped back by ComElectric or the phone company, but
I plan to sell the place before having to witness that indignity.)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I won't remove all the hillside brush, just some of the
Rosa multifloras, because those birds deserve a chance against the
cats that come hunting. (Except for one cat, a small black
adolescent that discovered the joys of Newfoundland dogs recently,
survived its back-yard encounter, and no doubt will never cross the
road again.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a second mugo pine is what I need in the foundation bed
where I took out the winter-damaged arborvitae a couple of years
ago. Those big needles would be lovely now and even more fetching
under a coating of snow. Or a dwarf Austrian pine, such as
``Hornibrookiana,'' with 2 1/2-inch-long needles, a height of 2
feet, and a 6-foot spread. Or maybe a Japanese black pine, which
also has big needles and has some mouth-watering cultivars
(``Iseli'' is gold variegated, 7 feet high and 3 feet wide).
Michael Dirr's Manual of Woody Landscape Plants will yield a
selection, followed by a hunt for a source.
</P>
<P>
   Examining the bones of the garden is a January exercise (it's a
meditation of sorts) and so is wading through the garden catalogs.
The pile is 5 inches high and contains 25 catalogs. (Make that 26,
the mail just came.) Most I never order from, or did 10 years ago.
Not that they're not all good, but one must make choices, and I
tend to use the same sources: Johnny's and Pine Tree Gardens for
veggies, Jackson &AMP; Perkins for roses (thanks to my Mom for the $25
gift certificate, a welcome drop in the bucket of cash I'll be
shipping off in trade for beauty), Shady Oaks for shade-loving
perennials (hostas especially).
</P>
<P>
   I'll be looking for a bamboo or two. They may come from Burt
Associates in Westford, New England Bamboo in Rockport, or Tripple
Brook Farm in Southampton. Heathers will come from Rock Spray
Nursery in Truro (though I can also order them from one of the
Internet retail sites that are proliferating). And woodland and
wild flowers from seed come from the New England Wildflower
Society's unmatched catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the seeds are already here, leftovers from last year and
the year before that (and even before that, truth be told). I keep
them in an old can in a cabinet where it is relatively dry and
cool. In a week or two, I'll sit and do an inventory. With tally in
hand, I'll then make a long list (longer with my wife's additions),
then begin paring. The final orders will still be too much, and
I'll run out of seed-starting room before I can begin planting out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, is when I mainly just take it all in _ what's
outdoors, what's in, what I have in mind, what's just beyond my
mental grasp. This is why this is a spiritual time.
</P>
<P>
   Gardening is so many things, art and science and pastime and
hobby and, save us, competition. Above all, it is intellectual, of
the mind, for it is beauty. A time when pretty much all you can
devote to gardening is thought must be a time of beauty, then.

BOOKS SHED LIGHT ON BIRTH OF THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   History books about the birth of cyberspace and the gestation of
the Internet have proved quite popular lately. Computers are
rapidly changing the world around us, and with the coming of the
next century there is almost as much impulse to turn and look back
as there is to look forward.
</P>
<P>
   But late last year a different kind of history was published by
Basic Books. Called ``Extra Life: Coming of Age in Cyberspace,''
this book is a startlingly personal and moving account of what it
was like in the late 1970s and 1980s to grow up with the new
technology. In this short book, David Bennahum packs in details of
his early experiences with computer games (hence the title),
software piracy, and drugs. He explains why kids like himself, who
saw themselves as perpetual outsiders, found solace among their
machines and eventually friendship in the extended computer family.
Bennahum, who now writes for Wired magazine out of its New York
advertising office, does much to shatter the Generation-X myth that
portrayed him and those of his age group as a bunch of troubled
teenagers and slacker young adults.
</P>
<P>
   Bennahum spent years working on Extra Life, and it has taken a
lot of twists and turns in the process. Although the end result is
pretty close to his original vision, getting there took him on his
own personal journey through the history of thinking machines. For
several years now Bennahum has been sharing this journey with
nearly 5,000 other readers through his free Internet mailing list,
MEME. He's also created the Community Memory mailing list, for
discussions on the history of cyberspace. Information on both of
these mailing lists, their archives, and details on how to join
them, are available on Bennahum's Web site www.memex.org. There you
will also find something quite rare: the full text of Bennahum's
interviews with such luminaries as Nicholas Negroponte, James
Gosling, Richard Stallman, and Jon Postel.
</P>
<P>
   A very different history of the last two decades of cyberspace
can be found in Dorothy E. Denning's new book, ``Information
Warfare and Security,'' published last month by Addison Wesley.
Denning, a professor at Georgetown University, has long been a
recognized leader in the field of computer security, but she made a
name for herself in the lay press in the 1980s when she tracked
down, interviewed, and wrote very sympathetic scholarly articles
about young computer attackers. A short time later Denning hooked
up with the FBI, where she learned a good deal about the darker
side of computer espionage and information warfare.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Denning is probably best known as the leading
academic to favor the regulation of encryption technology. For this
reason, many people had feared that a book by Denning on
``information warfare'' would be a long polemic in favor of
increased government controls over technology and the need to
sacrifice civil liberties in favor of national defense. Thankfully,
``Information Warfare and Security'' is nothing of the sort.
Instead, it's a balanced presentation of the whole gambit of
computer security issues, from computer viruses and insider threats
to the possibility of disruption or manipulation of the stock
market. But unlike other authors, who mostly try to scare the
reader into taking the threat seriously, Denning instead looks at
many of the claims made by information warfare enthusiasts to see
if they actually hold up.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on Jan. 10, 1992, ABC's ``Nightline'' aired a story
about a hostile computer virus that the Central Intelligence Agency
had introduced into Iraq shortly before the start of the Gulf War,
after US News and World Report had run a story on the same subject.
Allegedly the virus had been sent to Iraq in an infected printer.
Although a lot of computer scientists disbelieved the story, it was
nevertheless reported as fact by many publications during the
following. But in the first chapter of her book, Denning shows
convincingly how this story originated in an April 1, 1991, column
that John Gantz had written for InfoWorld, a computer trade
newspaper. Apparently the story had first been translated into
Japanese, where the significance of the April 1 date was not
appreciated, and then re-translated back into English by a foreign
correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   For a more in-depth look at the criminal mind, I'd recommend
Donn B. Parker's ``Fighting Computer Crime,'' published by Wiley.
Parker has spent more than 30 years tracking down computer
criminals and solving high-tech crimes; this book is actually a
revised edition of the book that he published with the same title
in 1983! Because of his age and experience, Parker is one of the
few computer crime experts who is able to write authoritatively
about crimes involving mainframes and banks. The book also has a
good amount of common-sense advice _ for example, why you might
want to write down your computer passwords, despite warnings not to
do so, and how to keep these written passwords from being
compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Besides simply surveying the landscape, ``Fighting Computer
Crime'' also presents a new framework for information security.
</P>
<P>
   While some security-minded managers might find this the most
relevant part of the book, because it gives concrete policies that
an organization can implement, I found it a bit drawn out.
</P>
<P>
   A book with considerably more technical leanings is Eric
Greenberg's ``Network Application Frameworks: Design and
Architecture.'' Greenberg has an impressive resume, having been one
of the lead security managers at Netscape Communications, and one
of the individuals responsible for Sprint International's global
Internet backbone. This book, also published by Addison Wesley,
gives a good overview of the Internet's plumbing, from the details
of the TCP/IP protocol and the new IP version 6, to distributed
object-oriented applications built from Java. If you ever wondered
exactly what bytes make up a TCP/IP header but didn't have time to
read the Internet RFCs, or if you need to know the difference
between NetWare 4.x and NetWare 5, this is the book for you. If you
don't have any idea what my previous sentence means, then there are
probably better books for you to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Books are enjoying something of a resurgence lately, probably
the result of our heady economic times. Bennahum's book is priced
at a reasonable $23 list, and is available at 30 percent off at
many stores. Both the Denning and Parker books are priced at
$34.95, and you'll be hard-pressed to find it discounted anywhere.
Meanwhile, ``Network Application Frameworks'' is priced at $49.95!
</P>
<P>
   Since authors like Greenberg or Denning typically only see a few
dollars for each book that sold, I wonder just how longer these
high-priced, paper-based intellectual property delivery systems are
going to be a part of our world.

_MASTECTOMY HOPE TEMPERED BY CAUTION  
_LDL-LOWERING DRUG PROMISING FOR BOYS 
_THE CANCER CARE FRONT: CALCIUM, NEW CHEMO

 Mastectomy hope tempered by caution  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; As advances in genetic testing make clearer which women may be
at very high risk of developing breast cancer, some women are
opting for what is called ``prophylactic mastectomy,'' or having
their breasts removed even before any sign of cancer appears.
</P>
<P>
   While it is a radical step, a study in the New England Journal
of Medicine indicates that it can reduce incidence of breast cancer
by 89 to 94 percent and save lives.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lynn C. Hartmann and colleagues from the Mayo Clinic in
Minnesota followed 639 women with a family history of breast cancer
who had undergone the procedure, for various reasons, between 1960
and 1993. The average age of the women at the time of the procedure
was 42. Based on family history, the women were deemed at either
high or moderate risk of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Recording the women's health for an average of 14 years,
Hartmann's team found 89.5 percent fewer cases of breast cancer
among the moderate-risk women than statistical models predicted.
Among the high-risk women, whose cancer rates were compared to
sisters who did not have the operation, mastectomies reduced cancer
incidence 90 to 94 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Andrea Eisen and Dr. Barbara
L. Weber of the University of Pennsylvania noted a complicated
ethical issue: As a result of ``a disfiguring and potentially
psychologically damaging operation,'' they wrote, just two women in
the group died of cancers that developed in breast tissue that was
not removed by surgery, instead of the 20 statistically expected if
none had had mastectomies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The saving of those 18 lives is clearly important, but the 621
women who probably would have survived without prophylactic
mastectomy paid a price that will be considered unacceptable in the
future,'' the doctors wrote. They said advances in use of
cancer-preventing drugs such as tamoxifen and ``more narrowly
targeted strategies'' should be developed as easier options.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &UR; LDL-lowering drug promising for boys
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A cholesterol-lowering drug widely used in adults who have a
genetic disorder that leads to very high rates of heart disease can
safely be used by boys without harming their physical or sexual
development, a study indicates.
</P>
<P>
   About 500,000 Americans suffer from the condition, heterozygous
familial hypercholesterolemia. Monitoring diet cannot help. Left
untreated, up to one in four boys who have the condition will die
of heart disease by age 50. The condition also raises girls' risk
of heart disease, but not as sharply.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, reported in this week's Journal of the American
Medical Association, researchers led by Dr. Evan A. Stein of a
private Kentucky laboratory tested three doses of lovastatin-type
drugs, marketed as Mevacor, on 132 boys age 10 to 17 in the United
States and Finland. On average, the boys had twice the healthy
level of LDL, or ``bad,'' cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that over 12 months, LDL levels were reduced by
17 to 27 percent _ with the highest reductions in boys given the
largest doses _ with no measured impact on sexual maturation or
hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Basil M. Rifkind and colleagues at the National Heart, Lung
and Blood Institute said that in light of earlier, smaller studies,
``It seems prudent to identify and treat HeFH in adolescent boys''
and that lovastatin seems to have ``no apparent adverse effects.''
However, because the study lasted only one year, ``more subtle''
impacts on the boys' growth ``may have gone unnoticed'' and longer
studies should be pursued.
</P>
<P>
   Merck &AMP; Co., which makes Mevacor, helped fund the peer-reviewed
study and has paid six of the researchers as consultants. Also, two
Merck employees were on the research team.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Calcium supplements can reduce the formation of bowel polyps
that frequently turn cancerous, Dartmouth Medical School
researchers report in the current New England Journal. In a study
of 832 patients, after nine months Dr. John A. Baron and colleagues
found a 19 percent decrease in polyp recurrence in men and women
taking 1,200 milligrams of calcium daily in calcium carbonate
supplements. Colon and rectal cancers account for 10 percent of
cancer deaths. . . . The Medicare program has agreed to pay for an
alternative tumor-shrinking chemotherapy called capecitabine for
older women whose breast cancer has metastasized. It can be taken
at home and may help thousands of women.

GAME'S TV-COMPUTER FUSION DROPS THE BALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They promised an enhanced experience. They promised historic
convergence. They promised no less than the dawn of the future.
</P>
<P>
   That might explain how I found myself shuttling back and forth
from the computer to the television Jan. 5 trying to experience the
Tostitos Fiesta Bowl on ABC. (Talk about history being made: The
last time I watched a Monday night football game was, well, never.)
Anyway, ABC Sports and ESPN _ both part of the Disney sports
machine _ had joined forces to produce a live Internet production
synchronized with the television broadcast of the championship
match between the Tennessee Volunteers and the Florida State
Seminoles. Among other features, the on-line application was
designed to ``push'' relevant graphics and information at the user
as the game unfolded; for instance, when Volunteer Peerless Price
caught that 79-yard pass and raced for a touchdown, his player card
would pop up on the computer screen, enabling users to click on it
to peruse his biography, his career record and so forth. Users
could also play a game that enabled them to predict the play
seconds before it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Now everyone in the entertainment and on-line industries is
scrambling for ways to merge the two mediums. A recent Showtime
study revealed that 20.2 million households have a PC and a
television in the same room, and 10 million of those households
report that they watch the tube and surf the Net at the same time.
So the ABC-ESPN collaboration had the potential to reach a large
audience and to break new ground. They certainly promoted it
aggressively: ``It is neither a television experience nor a
computer experience, but truly both at the same time,'' read a
breathless press release.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it was an experience, all right. An experience in
frustration. Perhaps it would have been wise to take a cue from a
strange misprint in the press release that explained, ``The
application can be directly accessed via Error! Bookmark not
defined.'' OK.
</P>
<P>
   Just minutes after the broadcast began at 8 p.m., the on-line
segment had already reached full capacity, and experience seekers
received a ``We're very sorry'' message. The application was
designed to accommodate only 100,000 users, and the production was
a victim of its own success.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's push a few statistics of our own. I was using a
top-of-the-line browser (Netscape 4.5) and a speedy cable
connection, so I had an edge over the folks trying to connect via a
28.8 modem. But, alas, I don't live in one of the 20.2 million
households with wired living rooms. The computer is around the
corner and across the hall from the den. So my experience went
something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Hit the reload button. Get the sorry message. Hear roars of
excitement from the TV. Run to the den, too late to catch the
instant replay of the touchdown. Race to the computer. Hit the
reload button. Race to the den, hear the color announcer yukking it
up about the Internet experiment being maxed out. Race to the
computer. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   It brought up memories of the early days of America Online, when
it took about 400 redials just to read your mail. It also dredged
up childhood memories of one of the first interactive television
shows, a cartoon named ``Winky Dink'' that was accessible only if
your parents bought you a kit with a magic screen and magic
crayons. But that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, I wasn't alone out there hitting the reload button.
``It could have been a great opportunity for Disney to showcase its
two premier sports brands working in unison, but this effort to
promote enhanced television was a joke,'' says Mark Hardie, senior
entertainment industry analyst for Forrester Research, Inc. in
Cambridge. ``There were all these people interested in what they
were doing, and they sent them packing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jonathan Leess, vice president of ABC Sports Multimedia,
sees things a little differently. ``Those who were on line had a
seamless wonderful experience,'' he says. ``It was almost
instantaneous. When someone got a touchdown, we had the player card
up before he spiked the ball. That, to us, was a home run.''
Interesting metaphor. Is that like scoring a basket in a hockey
game?
</P>
<P>
   Marquee sports events, though, are the ideal testing ground for
this thing called convergence. So far, no one has found an
effective way to truly merge the two technologies. Sure, chat show
hosts like Rosie O'Donnell and Jenny Jones read their e-mail on the
air, and various sitcoms have Web sites that are glorified fan
clubs where you can pick up gossip or buy coffee mugs. Users have
been able to chat on line during such popular events as the Academy
Awards or the last episode of ``Seinfeld.'' And the police drama
``Homicide'' recently experimented with a spinoff ``websodic''
on-line series called ``Second Shift,'' featuring three stories
combining video, audio, music and a role-playing game. (See
www.nbc.com/homicide/)
</P>
<P>
   But none of those attempts are really ``interactive''
television. The ABC-ESPN experiment did not incorporate any of the
on-line activity into the game broadcast. That's not to say that
anyone expects or needs the kind of programming that would let fans
in Boston tell Pete Carroll which formation to run or allow sleuths
at home to decide who's the culprit in a police drama. (A &AMP; E,
however, ran a ``Live By Request'' series that invited fans to call
a toll-free number or e-mail their song requests to the control
room during the concert. Yawn.)
</P>
<P>
   But there's one reason convergence is bound to happen: the
revenue, stupid. ABC's Leess says that the network didn't sell ads
for the on-line portion of the Fiesta Bowl, but they did run promos
for the companies that bought space on the television broadcast.
``We learned there is potential there,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, by the way, will broadcast the Super Bowl in 2000, and
Leess promises another ``enhanced experience.'' ``It will be a
version well beyond what we had Monday night,'' he says. ``A year
in this business is a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Monday night, ABC and ESPN are keeping a link to the
Fiesta Bowl application (abcsports.go.com) on their Web sites ``for
those who didn't get a chance to look.'' I tried it repeatedly over
the last few days: First you see a slow text-only slide show
promising great things, then a screen comes up with the interactive
game that doesn't work. That's it. No database. No score cards. Not
even a link to find out more about Peerless Price, the sprinter
whose name is a sportswriter's dream.
</P>
<P>
   To borrow an earlier metaphor, I guess I struck out in the
football game. Again, the whole experience reminds me of ``Winky
Dink,'' the interactive cartoon that aired from 1953 to 1957 and
was briefly revived in 1969 for late boomers like me. The title
character was always getting into scrapes, and the boys and girls
at home had to help him escape by drawing an object like a ladder
or a door onto a plastic screen attached to the television. Problem
was, you had to have the ``Winky Dink'' kit to participate _ or
draw directly on the screen, preferably not in indelible ink. Well,
guess who didn't have the kit? The same person who couldn't
experience enhanced football. Well, the Internet does have a salve
for the ``Winky Dink'' wound: There's an original unopened kit,
complete with magic crayons, up for auction at www.tvparty.com. The
current bid is $310. Now that might be a sign that true convergence
is arriving, at last.

CONSULTANTS SEE A TRIAL LIKE NO OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They are the highly paid hired guns who advise
prosecutors and defense lawyers on how to strengthen their chances
of winning. They are the savvy analysts of human behavior who help
their lawyer-clients decide which arguments to make, when to make
them, and to whom.
</P>
<P>
   They are jury consultants. And when they look at President
Clinton's impeachment trial, they are appalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost shouldn't be called a trial,'' said Paul Tieger, the
Connecticut-based author of ``The Art of Speedreading People''
whose courtroom clients have included Jack Kevorkian. ``When it's
convenient for the senators on either side to compare it to a
trial, they do . . . and when it doesn't serve their purposes, they
say it's something different, which it is. Entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, after stressing that they would have excluded every juror
in the Senate impeachment trial _ either for having a conflict of
interest or for being too biased, or both _ nearly a dozen jury
consultants interviewed Wednesday offered insights into the
strategies Clinton's accusers and defenders might employ and
outlined their advice for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, according to the jury experts, the lawyers
should all remember they will be addressing two juries, the one
sitting in the Senate chamber and the one watching television or
reading the newspaper. Crafting arguments that appeal to both, they
said, will be especially tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they're speaking to those two audiences, they're
walking a tightrope,'' said Melissa McMath Hatfield, an Arkansas
consultant who worked on Susan McDougal's Whitewater case and was
hired to help Clinton's lawyers if the Paula Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit had gone to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of her counterparts, Hatfield said she would advise
both sides to keep their presentations simple, focusing on a few
issues they believe are strongest. ``Then I would sit down and shut
up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants said that such a strategy would help with the
public, because polls show most Americans want the impeachment
drama to end, while minimizing weaker arguments that some senators
could use as a rationale for their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Some consultants also predicted that the two sides will target
pivotal senators who might then bring other senators along. This
tactic often is used in other trials, where lawyers design some
arguments to win over the foreman or some other juror perceived as
influential with the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should focus on the power brokers,'' said Elissa Krauss,
a consultant in New York with the National Jury Project who advised
Louise Woodward's lawyers in the former au pair's murder trial.
``You don't worry about pulling in a lot of people, but you give
the key ones something to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the consultants agreed that most senators and ordinary
citizens probably have their minds made up, several of those
interviewed suggested that emotion-based arguments were the most
likely to change opinions.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Amy Singer, a Florida-based consultant, said she
would tell the House managers to stress Clinton's deceptions and
ask whether the nation wants a liar as president. And Singer said
she would advise Clinton's lawyers to place their client's sorrow
and regret at the core of their presentation next week.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republican and Democratic senators say they will not be
swayed by constituents' sentiments as they deliberate the
president's fate. But the jury specialists said that seemed
impossible. One way this trial departs radically from all others,
the consultants said, is that the senator-jurors are permitted to
communicate with the public, which is deluging them with mail and
telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senators can't credibly say they're hearing from the folks
back home but not listening to them. . . . So we are the jury,''
said Singer, who assisted the defense in Michael Jackson's child
molestation case and William Kennedy Smith's rape trial.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only the extraordinary procedural rules, which allow
the jurors to overrule the judge, that separate Clinton's
impeachment trial from other judicial proceedings. It is also the
jurors themselves, who do not represent a cross-section of the
nation demographically, and who have clear conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Many senators have socialized with the defendant in this case,
while others may feel obligated because Clinton has raised campaign
money for them. A few may want to punish him for some past
political act unrelated to the current charges, and most have made
public statements indicating that they intensely like, distrust, or
otherwise feel strongly about him before hearing any evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the conflicts accepted during the political impeachment
process are taboo in normal trials.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Tim Hutchinson, for instance, will sit as a juror, even
though his brother and fellow Republican from Arkansas,
Representative Asa Hutchinson, will be one of the House managers
acting as a prosecutor in the trial. And Senator Barbara Boxer's
daughter is married to Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, so the
California Democrat will be deciding the fate of a relative of a
sort, as well as a member of the same political party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inconceivable that you would allow a jury like this on
any case anywhere. It's laughable,'' said Philip Anthony, the head
of the California firm DecisionQuest, which was hired by the
prosecution in O. J. Simpson's criminal trial and by the plaintiffs
in his civil suit. Anthony and others said they believed the jury's
composition will make it extremely difficult for lawyers on either
side to change anyone's views.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the consultants said, the prosecutors probably
won't be able to sway enough Democrats to clinch the two-thirds
vote needed for a conviction, but Clinton's defenders likely won't
be able to sway at least six Republicans to end the trial quickly.
Barring some surprise witness or testimony, Anthony said, the
outcome will be altered only if ``the emotion of the importance of
this event'' overwhelms enough senators to alter their votes.

<P>
   Boston College athletic director Gene DeFilippo and Nebraska AD
Bill Byrne are discussing the possibility of scheduling football
games between the schools, perhaps as early as the 2000 Pigskin
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want an East Coast presence,'' said Byrne Wednesday, ``and
Boston College would be a nice game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The first target would be the Pigskin Classic, but Byrne said he
will talk to DeFilippo about the possibility of bringing the
Cornhuskers to Boston at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   DeFilippo, who said the only commitment he is making right now
is to listen to Byrne, is also trying to find a way to juggle the
Eagles' schedule in 2000 to accommodate the University of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies, who officially requested football membership in the
Big East earlier this week, are attempting to pick up Division 1-A
games as an independent for the next few years as they gradually
make the transition from 1-AA.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no written guarantees, UConn's admittance as
the Big East's ninth football member is a foregone conclusion. The
final word of approval must come from the presidential level.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can work it out, we'll try and help them out,''
DeFilippo said. ``It would be a nice game for the region _ the only
two schools in New England that play 1-A football.''
</P>
<P>
   One possibility being discussed is UConn vs. BC in the first
college game at the proposed stadium in downtown Hartford, where
the Patriots are scheduled to relocate in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arizona-Penn State?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although no announcement is expected for a few weeks, look for
an Arizona-at-Penn State Pigskin Classic this summer, which could
mean a matchup of two preseason Top 10 teams . . . Bowl
Championship Series people are thinking about tinkering with the
criteria and creating minimum standards for each of the conference
champions who now receive automatic bids to the BCS bowls. Those
standards would include a minimum of nine regular-season wins and a
Top 10 ranking. With that stipulation, the Big East would not have
had a represenative in the BCS this season, since conference
champion Syracuse failed to meet either of those minimum
requirements . . . Latest word on Notre Dame and the Big Ten: The
Irish remain an independent.

RATING THE FIDELITY MONEY MANAGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who's the best money manager working in the giant stable of
stock jockeys at Fidelity Investments?
</P>
<P>
   Identifying the best _ and worst _ mutual fund managers at any
big shop is no simple task. Fidelity Investor, an independent
newsletter that tracks the world's biggest fund company, is taking
a shot at it.
</P>
<P>
   Tops on its list: Charles Mangum, manager of the $9.4 billion
Dividend Growth fund. Mangum, who has managed five different
Fidelity funds over seven years, turned in one of his best
performances ever in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Fidelity Investor rating system measures a manager's
career-long performance, usually involving several different funds.
It tracks returns relative to the performances of stock benchmarks
geared to individual funds and adjusts the numbers for the amount
of risk taken to make money. Lifetime records are blended with
performances over the last three years to get a final rating
number.
</P>
<P>
   ``This reveals (Mangum) to be even stronger than I thought,''
said James Lowell, editor of Fidelity Investor. ``Not only is he
significantly ahead of his benchmarks, he's significantly ahead of
his peers at Fidelity.''
</P>
<P>
   Mangum's performance was not lost on Fidelity customers last
year. Dividend Growth was
</P>
<P>
   by far the company's most successful fund when it came to
pulling in new money during 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Dividend Growth attracted $3.5 billion in new cash through the
first 11 months of 1998, according to Financial Research Corp., a
Boston consulting firm. Those cash flows made Dividend Growth the
nation's fourth most popular fund, behind only Vanguard Index 500,
American Funds' Washington Mutual Investors, and the Janus Twenty
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Dividend Growth's 35.9 percent gain last year was the magnet
drawing new cash. But the Fidelity Investor rating also calculated
Mangum's performance on Dividend Growth in 1997 and his results
managing Fidelity's OTC Portfolio, Convertible Securities, and two
sector funds.
</P>
<P>
   Mangum also oversaw funds for colleague George Vanderheiden
while he was on a sabbatical during most of 1998, though those
results were not included in the calculations.
</P>
<P>
   John Muresianu, who was recently named as the new manager of the
Fidelity Fifty fund, finished second in the ranking. Muresianu had
run several sector funds.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Tillinghast, the longtime manager of Fidelity Low-Priced
Stock, ranked third on the list. Magellan's Robert Stansky, who
runs more money than any other mutual fund manager in the world,
was rated fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Hetnarski, manager of Fidelity's Export fund, finished on
the bottom of the 29-member list. Tim Krochuk of the TechnoQuant
Growth fund and Nike Thakore, manager of Fidelity's Trend fund,
finished just above Hetnarski. They were immediately below
well-regarded veteran Rich Fentin, who runs the $5.9 billion Value
fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always something on a ranking analysis that
surprises,'' said Lowell. ``On the positive side, there was Mangum
but on the flip side it's Fentin, no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A Fidelity spokesman declined to comment on the ranking of fund
managers.
</P>
<P>
   The Fidelity Investor rankings found that the performance of
just over half the general stock fund managers _ 15 of 29 _ was
better than the results that would have been produced by a passive
index fund.
</P>
<P>
   The same system also rated Fidelity's managers who are limited
to investing in specific industry sectors or in international
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda McGettigan of Fidelity's Select Construction was rated
as the top sector fund manager. She was followed by Peter
Saperstone, who runs funds investing in utilities and
telecommunications, and Tom Allen, manager of Fidelity's Select
Insurance fund.
</P>
<P>
   Among international funds, Fidelity Japan Small Companies
manager Kenichi Mizuskhita easily topped the field.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cha-ching.
</P>
<P>
   Staples Inc. chief executive Tom Stemberg has sold about $40
million worth of stock in his company. The options-related
transaction amounted to about 15 percent of his holdings. Staples
shares soared by 136 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Stemberg, who sold 900,000 Staples shares, still owns about 5.3
million shares or options.

SLOPES CAN TEST YOUR TOLERANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are always taking tests of self-examination. How we feel
about stuff. Pulse of the nation. We hardly seem able to know what
we think and feel anymore without thumbing through a Reader's
Digest or Cosmo and answering 20 questions about what we're all
about.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the dentist's waiting room we pencil in our answers,
then (making very sure no one is peering over at what we're doing)
tally up the score and check to see where we fit in the big
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most scientific of such tests are found in this
space each year, and 1999 is no exception. This year's
self-awareness test involves two groups with as many similarities
as differences _ skiers and snowboarders _ and probes each to
discover their attitudes toward the other. Choose a category and
answer the six questions, keeping track of your score.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SKIERS:
</P>
<P>
   A. When I hear a snowboard coming from behind I: 1. Continue
skiing as I was; 2. Ski in a straight line to minimize the chance
of a crash; 3. Cringe and hope the boarder knows what he's doing;
4. Get ready for a swift death by a pack of snowgoing Hell's
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   B. Snowboards make different kinds of turns because: 1. It takes
them longer to swing from edge to edge; 2. They use the entire fall
line, looping treeline to treeline; 3. They dig deep grooves in the
snow; 4. They push all the snow off the trails, leaving scratchy
ice.
</P>
<P>
   C. If my child says he/she wants to take up boarding instead of
skiing I'll: 1. Try to arrange a ride on a demo board and a lesson;
2. Make a deal so he/she can snowboard half the day if they don't
give up skiing altogether; 3. Let him/her try boarding, but no
sloppy clothes, goatees, cigarette (and other) smoking, spitting,
cussing, and Beastie Boys; 4. Let him/her try boarding but I won't
pay for the equipment, lift tickets, food, clothes, or let them
ride to the slopes in my car.
</P>
<P>
   D. On boarders and safety: 1. They're about the same as skiers
and safety; 2. Boarders are younger and so inherently less safety
conscious; 3. Boarders ignore most of the safety rules; 4.
Flaunting safety rules is part of boarders' insane style.
</P>
<P>
   E. The reason we share the slopes with boarders is because: 1.
Boarding is here to stay; 2. It's hard to find an excuse not to let
them be there; 3. If it weren't for boarding, skiing would be in
real economic trouble; 4. How can you win an argument with a
bunching of yapping adolescents?
</P>
<P>
   F. My general impression of boarding is: 1. It's a fun new twist
to an old sport, and an infusion of new blood and spirit; 2. An
inevitable new wave created by a new generation looking for change;
3. It's going to push its way in whether we want it or not; 4. A
fad bound to run its course and disappear.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOARDERS:
</P>
<P>
   A. When I see skiers in front of me I: 1. Slow down and try to
anticipate his turns; 2. Cruise over to the other side of the trail
to pass safely; 3. Keep on my line but turn out of their way in
time; 4. Try to scare the bejeezus out of them.
</P>
<P>
   B. Skiers seem to: 1. Have generally accepted our presence in
ski country; 2. Be learning to live with us; 3. Think we're a
danger to them and the snow; 4. Expect us to act like unkempt,
anti-social brats, so we won't disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   C. When skiers take up boarding they: 1. Expand their
experiences on the slopes; 2. Feel a new sense of freedom; 3. See
what mountains are supposed to feel like in winter; 4. Finally get
it right, and it was about time.
</P>
<P>
   D. Boarding is: 1. About freedom and beauty; 2. About being true
to ourselves; 3. Going to show everyone the way to go, but once
they go there I've got to find something else to do; 4. Something
for you to figure out for yourself, jerkie.
</P>
<P>
   E. What skiers should know about us is: 1. Under our clothes and
equipment, we're the same as they are, people looking for the same
winter fun; 2. Unlike skiers who put in maybe 10 days a year, we're
so committed that we put in three times that; 3. We feel freer with
no poles, have just one board to worry about, and our feet never
hurt; 4. I'll smoke, spit, and swear wherever the hell I want to.
</P>
<P>
   F. My general impression of skiing is: 1. There's nothing wrong
with it; 2. It was fun once, but I'll never go back; 3. Too much
gear, too tight, feet always hurt; 4. By 2010, stick a fork in it.
</P>
<P>
   Add up your score and check it against the key below for a most
scientific explanation of your attitudes and expectations toward
each other.
</P>
<P>
   _ From 6 to 9 points: You're so syruppy nice to skiers/boarders
you should be ashamed of yourself, wimp. Do you live to get along
with everybody? Want everybody to love you? Stand up for your
values.
</P>
<P>
   _ From 10 to 13 points: It looks as if this marriage can be
saved, but we need to try and look at our sport from the other
guy's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   _ From 14 to 17 points: I know we all have to share the same
snow, but I'm still keeping up my guard.
</P>
<P>
   _ From 18 to 21 points: They may be here, but I don't have to
like them.
</P>
<P>
   _ From 22 to 24 points: It's war, baby. Keep your head down!

JETS' HISTORY HASN'T BEEN A SUCCESS STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N. Y. _ Think the Patriots have endured buffoonery
and foibles through the years? Tell it to Jets fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have had 13 head coaches in four decades, but the only
one with a winning record is You Know Who, the Great White Tuna.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Clippers of
football. They make the Patriots' history look like that of the
Dallas Cowboys or the New York Yankees. And as they prepare for the
AFC Championship Game Sunday in Denver, it's worth taking a look
back at some of the memorable Jet calamities of the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   They were born the New York Titans in 1959 and selected immortal
Notre Dame quarterback George Izo with their first draft pick.
Slingin' Sammy Baugh was paid $28,000 to coach the Titans in their
first season.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in blue and gold colors, the Titans beat Buffalo, 27-3,
in front of 10,200 fans (5,727 paid) in their first game at the
Polo Grounds. No one can remember any fan wearing a fire hat
leading a chant of ``Titans, Titans, Titans!''
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, a five-man conglomerate, including Leon Hess, bought
the Jets for $1 million. Two weeks later, Weeb Ewbank was named
head coach and the team's name was changed to Jets.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, the year of the New York World's Fair, the Jets moved
to state-of-the-art Shea Stadium _ a place where real jets flew
overhead through every game. A few months later, the Jets drafted
quarterback Joe Namath of Alabama and signed him to an
unprecedented rookie contract of $427,000. Namath's first knee
operation came 23 days after he signed the deal. On July 28, 1965,
Namath led a team of Jet rookies to victory over a team of Patriot
rookies in Lowell, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 17, 1968, the Jets led the Raiders, 32-29, with 1:05
left, and network television cut away to make time for ``Heidi.''
While football fans called their local affiliates, the Raiders
scored 14 points in 42 seconds to beat the Jets, 43-32. Two months
later, Namath won the Super Bowl for the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Clive Rush left the Jets to become head coach of the Patriots in
1969, and the result was some of the most hilarious stuff in New
England football history. Poor Clive was almost electrocuted at his
introductory press conference. We can thank the Jets for the Clive
Rush Era.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Namath ``retired'' because the NFL was
contesting his ownership of Bachelors III, a Manhattan saloon. It
took only a few New York minutes for Broadway Joe to sell the joint
and come out of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, making room for the Mets, who were en route to the
World Series, the Jets played their first six games on the road and
wound up playing only six home games. In their final home game, a
34-14 loss to the Bills, O.J. Simpson ran for 200 yards to finish
with a record 2,003 for the season. Ewbank retired and handed the
job over to his son-in-law, Charlie Winner.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, His Majesty Emperor Hirohito of Japan watched the
Patriots rip the Jets in New York's opener at Shea. The Jets
started 2-7 and the not so aptly named Winner departed. Ken Shipp
took over, finished 3-11, and yielded to Lou Holtz.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, Lou Holtz. Holtz was telling whoppers at Shea long
before Rick Pitino explained lying by telling us, ``That's how I
felt when I said it.'' Holtz wrote a Jets fight song, went 3-10,
and quit with a week left in the season to take over at the
University of Arkansas. Mike Holovak, the former Boston College
captain and one of the best Patriot coaches of all time, coached
the final game of the 1969 season and endured a 42-3 beating at the
hands of the Cincinnati Bengals. Holovak's only Jet game was
Namath's last in a New York uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Things got better in Jet land when Walt Michaels took over.
Michaels coached six seasons and brought the Jets back to the AFC
Championship Game but was fired after New York was shut out by the
Miami Dolphins. In 1978, during the Michaels era, the Jets changed
their uniform and logo. Big mistake. This was around the time Jets
fans became a nuisance at the NFL draft, hooting from the balcony
whenever New York made its first pick.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets lost the 1983 AFC title came to the Dolphins, and Jet
followers still believe they lost because nobody put a tarp on the
Orange Bowl field. The mud smothered Jet running back Freeman
McNeil, and the Dolphins prevailed, 14-0. It was the Jets' last
appearance in the AFC title game. Michaels never coached another
game with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels begat Joe Walton, who begat Bruce Coslet. It was all
forgettable. Next came Pete Carroll (we know what that means), and
his one-year term was marked by a season-ending five-game losing
streak which started when the team fell asleep and yielded a
game-winning Miami touchdown on a Dan Marino fake spike play.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll gave way to the truly woeful Rich Kotite, who went 4-28.
The Kotite era is best remembered for almost a quarter of a million
no-shows and a hideous book by rookie Keyshawn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Bill Parcells. He orchestrated a monster comeback in 1997,
but not even the Tuna could escape hearing, ``Same old Jets.''
Parcells's first season ended when he made two dubious decisions
late in the final game against the Detroit Lions. Third-string
quarterback Ray Lucas and fullback Leon Johnson _ neither of whom
had thrown a pass all year _ threw interceptions to run the Jets
right out of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets believe the cloud is lifted. But beware. Boston fans
know. More than once, we've heard surging Red Sox teams say, ``The
past has nothing to do with us,'' only to watch them add a new
chapter to their sad soap opera.

CARING ENOUGH TO FEEL SHAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY, Utah _ Like many local residents, Darin Smedley
isn't making excuses. Bribery is wrong, he says. But _ and
inevitably residents offer this but _ Salt Lake City did only what
other cities vying to host the Olympics have done before.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake, however, is a city still capable of shame. Smedley
says he feels it. So does Utah Governor Mike Leavitt. From City
Hall to the ZCMI Center Mall in the capital's well-scrubbed
downtown, people describe themselves as ashamed and embarrassed
that bribes were paid to help them win the 2002 Winter Olympics
Games.
</P>
<P>
   At his Utah Spirit kiosk in the mall, Smedley has been fretting
about the spreading scandal. Everything he sells is emblazoned with
the Olympic logo. Smedley says he isn't worried about business. His
concern is reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought of us as this little Mormon hick place before,
and now we look even worse,'' said Smedley, a lapsed Mormon. ``But
the religious influence here is not as prevalent as people think.
We've got the same bad stuff going on as anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In unexpected ways, the disclosures have laid bare the struggle
within Salt Lake City's soul. Even as residents react to the
allegations with outrage, few appear stunned. The big city came to
Salt Lake years ago, they say, even if its small-town heart tends
to show through in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's upsetting is that we're a nice city; we're Mormons,''
said homemaker Joan Morris. ``This should not happen here. But
we're not naive. We know what goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   While 70 percent of Utahans belong to the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints, less than half of Salt Lake residents do. The
170,000-plus people who live and work here consider themselves
thoroughly modern urbanites. Many, particularly younger people,
resent the state's image as a quaint Mormon backwater whose best
attribute is its snowfall. With 820,000 people in the greater
metropolitan region, they want Salt Lake taken seriously as a
21st-century city.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an undercurrent of morality runs through the response to
the widening scandal. Many Utahans are ready to accept much of the
blame. Few are willing to shoulder all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, they insisted, local boosters handed out cash,
scholarships, and other gifts to officials of the International
Olympic Committee and their relatives only because of lessons
learned. After four failed attempts to win the Olympics, certain
members of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee had come to
understand that bribery _ or, as many people put it, extortion _
was as much a part of the games as the bobsled competition. In
sports circles, observers say, Olympic payoffs have been an open
secret for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned that you either play the game, or you don't get the
games,'' said Reid Jones, a Salt Lake City financial consultant.
``We shouldn't have succumbed, but we did. . . . If we could go
back and do it all over again, I'd like to think we'd walk away
without losing our integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, outcry over the scandal has cost the jobs of two top
officials of the Salt Lake committee. Both men resigned under
pressure last week.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mayor Deedee Corradini abruptly announced that she
would not seek a third term, a decision she called personal and
unrelated to the Olympics. ``This has been horrible for our city,
but we will move on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of investigations are ongoing, and more jobs stand to
be lost from the local to the international level. Utahans want to
see some IOC members expelled. Although no sponsors have pulled out
of the games, fund-raisers who are currently ahead of schedule
worry that many more revelations could cost them sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly galling to Utahans is that it appears Salt Lake had
the votes to win 2002 Winter Games anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Leavitt went on national television to tell America
that the scandal does not represent Utah's values.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people in the international community understand the
gifts and the wining and dining. We went too far. But should you
need a compass to draw the line?'' said Nolan Karras, appointed the
governor's representative on the SLOC after the city's Olympic bid
was secured.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are waiting for the ethics report to see how bad it
is, and then we'll know exactly what we're up against,'' Karras
said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Utahans are promising the best Olympics ever, a
competition that they vow will relegate the scandal to a footnote.
Officials with the local, state and international committees say
the games will go on.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that most people in Utah still support hosting the
Olympics, which will cost the state $59 million for new facilities
and millions more in related expenditures, outlays the state hopes
it will more than earn back in tourist dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Dan Jones said 62 percent of Utahans favored holding
the Olympics in Salt Lake City, up from 53 percent when the scandal
first broke.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, of course, looks forward to the Olympics.
Complaints about road building and construction are ubiquitous, and
concerns about car and tourist traffic in 2002 abound. Stephen
Pace, who heads a small group calling itself Utahns for Responsible
Spending, has opposed public spending on the games, arguing that
taxes could be better spent.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Glenn Bailey wants to ensure that some of the
money is spent on Salt Lake City's needy. His Salt Lake Impact 2002
and Beyond Coalition has been pushing local officials to turn the
athletes' villages into affordable housing when the games conclude.
So far, Bailey said, his group has gotten nowhere with its
campaign, despite Utah's take-care-of-its-own reputation. Now he
hopes the focus on right vs. wrong will gain him access to the
organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   Access, said state Representative Dave Jones, should also mean
immediate public access to every aspect of the Olympic effort. He
wants the local committee's books and meetings open to scrutiny.
Only by doing so, he said, can Salt Lake overcome the adversity it
now faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a setback, but we're no stranger to adversity;
remember the city was founded by pioneers who were run out of other
places,'' Jones said. ``We have the desire and the ability to go
forth and show the world we can do this.''

CONSULTANTS SEE A TRIAL LIKE NO OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They are the highly paid hired guns who advise
prosecutors and defense lawyers on how to strengthen their chances
of winning. They are the savvy analysts of human behavior who help
their lawyer-clients decide which arguments to make, when to make
them, and to whom.
</P>
<P>
   They are jury consultants. And when they look at President
Clinton's impeachment trial, they are appalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost shouldn't be called a trial,'' said Paul Tieger, the
Connecticut-based author of ``The Art of Speedreading People''
whose courtroom clients have included Jack Kevorkian. ``When it's
convenient for the senators on either side to compare it to a
trial, they do . . . and when it doesn't serve their purposes, they
say it's something different, which it is. Entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, after stressing that they would have excluded every juror
in the Senate impeachment trial _ either for having a conflict of
interest or for being too biased, or both _ nearly a dozen jury
consultants interviewed Wednesday offered insights into the
strategies Clinton's accusers and defenders might employ and
outlined their advice for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, according to the jury experts, the lawyers
should all remember they will be addressing two juries, the one
sitting in the Senate chamber and the one watching television or
reading the newspaper. Crafting arguments that appeal to both, they
said, will be especially tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they're speaking to those two audiences, they're
walking a tightrope,'' said Melissa McMath Hatfield, an Arkansas
consultant who worked on Susan McDougal's Whitewater case and was
hired to help Clinton's lawyers if the Paula Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit had gone to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of her counterparts, Hatfield said she would advise
both sides to keep their presentations simple, focusing on a few
issues they believe are strongest. ``Then I would sit down and shut
up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants said that such a strategy would help with the
public, because polls show most Americans want the impeachment
drama to end, while minimizing weaker arguments that some senators
could use as a rationale for their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Some consultants also predicted that the two sides will target
pivotal senators who might then bring other senators along. This
tactic often is used in other trials, where lawyers design some
arguments to win over the foreman or some other juror perceived as
influential with the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should focus on the power brokers,'' said Elissa Krauss,
a consultant in New York with the National Jury Project who advised
Louise Woodward's lawyers in the former au pair's murder trial.
``You don't worry about pulling in a lot of people, but you give
the key ones something to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the consultants agreed that most senators and ordinary
citizens probably have their minds made up, several of those
interviewed suggested that emotion-based arguments were the most
likely to change opinions.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Amy Singer, a Florida-based consultant, said she
would tell the House managers to stress Clinton's deceptions and
ask whether the nation wants a liar as president. And Singer said
she would advise Clinton's lawyers to place their client's sorrow
and regret at the core of their presentation next week.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republican and Democratic senators say they will not be
swayed by constituents' sentiments as they deliberate the
president's fate. But the jury specialists said that seemed
impossible. One way this trial departs radically from all others,
the consultants said, is that the senator-jurors are permitted to
communicate with the public, which is deluging them with mail and
telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senators can't credibly say they're hearing from the folks
back home but not listening to them. . . . So we are the jury,''
said Singer, who assisted the defense in Michael Jackson's child
molestation case and William Kennedy Smith's rape trial.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only the extraordinary procedural rules, which allow
the jurors to overrule the judge, that separate Clinton's
impeachment trial from other judicial proceedings. It is also the
jurors themselves, who do not represent a cross-section of the
nation demographically, and who have clear conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Many senators have socialized with the defendant in this case,
while others may feel obligated because Clinton has raised campaign
money for them. A few may want to punish him for some past
political act unrelated to the current charges, and most have made
public statements indicating that they intensely like, distrust, or
otherwise feel strongly about him before hearing any evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the conflicts accepted during the political impeachment
process are taboo in normal trials.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Tim Hutchinson, for instance, will sit as a juror, even
though his brother and fellow Republican from Arkansas,
Representative Asa Hutchinson, will be one of the House managers
acting as a prosecutor in the trial. And Senator Barbara Boxer's
daughter is married to Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, so the
California Democrat will be deciding the fate of a relative of a
sort, as well as a member of the same political party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inconceivable that you would allow a jury like this on
any case anywhere. It's laughable,'' said Philip Anthony, the head
of the California firm DecisionQuest, which was hired by the
prosecution in O. J. Simpson's criminal trial and by the plaintiffs
in his civil suit. Anthony and others said they believed the jury's
composition will make it extremely difficult for lawyers on either
side to change anyone's views.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the consultants said, the prosecutors probably
won't be able to sway enough Democrats to clinch the two-thirds
vote needed for a conviction, but Clinton's defenders likely won't
be able to sway at least six Republicans to end the trial quickly.
Barring some surprise witness or testimony, Anthony said, the
outcome will be altered only if ``the emotion of the importance of
this event'' overwhelms enough senators to alter their votes.

VIKINGS TRIED TO WING IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Only football fans of a certain age _ say, 50 and
up _ can fully appreciate how David Palmer was lined up three times
in last Sunday's 41-21 Vikings playoff win over the Cardinals and
what Palmer was trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   Those under 50, spotting quarterback Randall Cunningham flanked
wide as a receiver and halfback Palmer standing 5 or so yards
behind his center and offensive line, might have guessed this was a
type of shotgun formation. It is all they know from watching
``SportsCenter.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was so much more _ a blast of nostalgia. That's because
Palmer was lined up in a type of single wing formation, which
really hasn't been used, with a rare exception or two, for some 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, the single wing was football's dominant
formation. For most of the first 50 years of this century, it was
the formation that virtually every team used, a formation that
seemingly would go on forever. But in 1940, Stanford coach Clark
Shaughnessy invented the T formation, in which the quarterback took
the ball directly from center instead of having it snapped back,
and the T eventually caught on in the late 1940s and '50s and led
to the various formations now so familiar to fans.
</P>
<P>
   What the Vikings did Sunday was not a true single wing, since
the ``ends'' _ now known as wide receivers _ were not flanked far
to the outside in the single wing. The single wing was a tight
formation, with the ends doing what ends were named to do: line up
at the end of the offensive line. Also, the backs were lined up
differently, and no quarterback in the single wing ever was lined
up far outside, as Cunningham was.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been planning and planning on doing this,'' said Palmer,
the scatback who was a quarterback at Alabama. ``We decided on
letting everything loose. We didn't want to hold anything back.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer took the direct snap from center in the Vikings' version
of the single wing and twice ran for good gains. On the third try,
Palmer was looking to pass but could not find a receiver and took a
short loss.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one of many tricks in offensive coordinator Brian
Billick's bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randall's role in that formation is just to stay out of the
way,'' said Palmer, ``not to get hurt.'' Ah, but Cunningham's role
was so much more, as Billick explained, because when the defense
``saw Randall way out there, they weren't sure of anything. There
was confusion on the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Billick ``told me before the game that he was going to lay
everything on the line,'' said Palmer. ``He told me he was going to
run that play (on third downs), and so I was definitely prepared.
And I'm glad he called my number.''
</P>
<P>
   The single wing play has ``a couple of options, since there are
some options on where I can run,'' said Palmer. ``But the big thing
is to give the defense a different look.''
</P>
<P>
   A look from the deep, deep past of football, when there were
leather helemts and no face masks.

DEFENSIVE FOCUS HELPS THORNTON PURSUE HIS GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He can't remember when it wasn't with him or even when
it first arrived. He just knows it has been there as for as long as
he can remember. It was there when he was growing up in St. Thomas,
Ontario, and it has followed him to Boston, growing in size all the
while.
</P>
<P>
   When he drives his truck, he can see it in the rearview mirror.
It follows him to his favorite restaurant, pool hall, and movie
theater. It stays in his room when he sleeps at night, greeting him
in the morning when he wakes up.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, when Joe Thornton takes the ice, the burden known
as ``potential'' weighs like a 400-pound piano on the back of the
19-year-old Bruins center.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns loves it when out-of-town reporters arrive to
write about his team or if an unfamiliar local writer shows up at
practice. Instead of waiting for a query from them, Burns cuts to
the chase, asking them which of the two most popular subjects
they're interested in: ``OK, is it Ray Bourque or Joe Thornton?''
</P>
<P>
   Since Thornton's first day at training camp, Burns has
alternated between being drill instructor and mentor,
disciplinarian and teacher. In dealing with the media, Burns has
been a protector, telling the press to just let the kid play.
Through it all, Burns has spent his time filling in the blanks of
Thornton's education.
</P>
<P>
   The latest lesson was in Nashville when center Chris Taylor, who
had been substituting for older brother Tim on the club's top
defensive line, went down with a shoulder injury. Burns, short on
centermen, installed Thornton in that spot.
</P>
<P>
   To the casual observer, it was a head-scratcher. Here was a kid
who was expected to provide offense, who had scored 122 points in
59 games his last year of junior hockey and never was within
shouting distance of his own goaltender, playing on a line that was
expected to prevent opponents' best forwards from putting the puck
in the net. To that point, Thornton had struggled to put the pieces
together for an entire NHL game.
</P>
<P>
   He went into the contest in Nashville with four goals and five
assists in 33 games. In six games on the defensive line, Thornton
had three goals and one assist. He played more physical, he played
consistently, he played with passion. If you could draw a picture
of Thornton during that time, it would be of the 19-year-old, clad
in hockey gear with a light bulb over his head, and the word
``Eureka!'' next to it. Which proves that, as always, there was a
method to the coach's madness.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `It's hard when you play good lines because you're star-struck
at first,'' said Thornton, who was flanked by P.J. Axelsson and Rob
DiMaio during his time of discovery. ``I don't know if it was hard
for me to learn defense, but it could've been because I never had
to do it before. It was an adjustment for me.''
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the reason the Bruins kept him around last season
rather than send him back to junior. His defensive habits were
nonexistent at the time, and Burns feared they would grow worse.
Thornton agreed with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have learned anything; it would've been just go out
and score,'' he said. ``I would've gone out and tried to score four
goals a game. I wouldn't have been worried about defense, that's
for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the key to Thornton's recent offensive spurt was
that he didn't give offense any thought. He was so focused on
defense that he scored points as a byproduct, exactly what Burns
had tried without success to drive home previously. Thornton didn't
understand that verbal explanation, didn't believe it, or both. So
instead, Burns had Thornton illustrate the point for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't been stressing score, score, score,'' the
youngster said. ``I've been stressing just go out and play hard and
hit. If you play good defense, you get more chances. Maybe 30 games
ago, I was thinking go out and play offense and worry about defense
next. Now I'm worried about defense first.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the season, the Bruins penciled Thornton
into the second-line center role, not knowing if he was ready for
it. When it appeared he might not be, he was relegated to
fourth-line duty. To that point, the only line Thornton hadn't
played on was the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   With Tim Taylor returning Friday night in Buffalo, Thornton will
once again be on the second line, and Burns hopes the kid knows he
can't stop playing defense just because he's no longer with
Axelsson and DiMaio. Thornton realizes that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go through it to really know what it is,'' he said.
``If you've always played offense, you don't know (the importance
of defense). I had to learn it was true. Pat knew that I had to be
pushed and he did that. Last year he brought me along slowly, and
this year I'm on the power play and the second line. I think he's
done a good job. He definitely knows what buttons to push.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He didn't even mind that Burns demoted him to the fourth line
earlier, knowing full well that he deserved to be there, and that
is what made him elevate his game in order to move up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on the second line and then you go down to the
fourth, you wonder,'' he said. ``All you've got to do is go out and
work harder, and that's what I did to get back up there. I had to
play physical. I did wonder, but it all worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   A few shifts into his role with the checking line, Thornton felt
strongly that he could live up to that assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I did it, I knew this is how you play defense,'' he said.
``I had to go through it to know it. As soon as I did it, I
thought, `This is all right. We can play with these guys and we can
get goals against these big lines.' ''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio thought Thornton did a terrific job filling in. He said
the youngster was made aware how much responsibility he would have
and he rose to the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played hard, he played intense, he played physical, and he
created a lot offensively,'' said DiMaio. ``He can't change the way
he plays. Joe has to realize that's how he has to play every night,
no matter who he plays with. It's like teaching a dog new tricks _
it takes time. It's come maybe a little slower than some people
would've liked, but he's still a young man. He's getting it now.
You can just see the difference in his game and his attitude in the
dressing room. He's having fun and playing hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised. We've never seen it from him because nobody
expected it out of him. Everybody expected him to be the guy to go
down and beat everybody one-on-one and score a goal. In this
league, you can't do that, especially not an 18- or 19-year-old
kid. I was pleasantly surprised to see him develop the way he has.
I enjoyed playing with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning a different and important aspect of his profession has
made life easier for his teammates, his coach, and himself. Add to
that the increased intensity level demanded by both Burns and the
nature of playing defense and Thornton is well on his way to making
a consistent impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to play hard for Pat or you're not going to play,''
said Thornton. ``He wants us to play with emotion. He's stressed
that a lot, and I think I finally understand that. If Kyle
(McLaren, the young defenseman) doesn't play with a mean streak,
he's not as effective, and I think it's the same thing for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The improvement has come slowly, incrementally. Thornton has
been marketed as an exciting star in the making, and if his
schooling continues at this rate, that will become reality. But the
fame hasn't been easy, the expectations haven't been easy, and
trying to satisfy everyone has been the most difficult of all.
</P>
<P>
   When Thornton went back to St. Thomas for Christmas, he faced
the predicatable questions regarding his modest offensive numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're wondering, `Hey, why aren't you in the top 10 in
scoring?' '' said Thornton. ``Some people wonder what's going on,
like, `How come you haven't scored 30 goals yet?' It doesn't happen
like that. But all my buddies know it's a long-term thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits that early on, he didn't think it would be a long-term
thing. He thought, as many did, that he would show up for his first
day in the NHL and pick up where he left off in junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that easy, and you have to be educated to kind of see
that,'' he said. ``Sometimes I don't know what to say, so I just
say, `I'm trying my best.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He knows he can't do anything about the 400-pound burden of
potential. He can't control what everyone else thinks. In his
private moments lately, Thornton has been happy with the small
steps he's taken, secure in the knowledge he's moving ahead a
little at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of interesting to see how I'm progressing,'' he
said. ``I've learned so much the last three months. It's been
unbelievable. I do get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that makes the load on his back a little lighter.

SAFER THAN IT APPEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was 44 years old before she tried downhill skiing and found
her new sport: first, a little scary but exciting; second, easier
to advance than she thought; third, a thrill.
</P>
<P>
   Those were her first three days on the slopes. On her fourth
day, as she stood at the side of a trail merge, at a precipice to a
spot where kids like to jump, a young out-of-control skier
following his speeding friends fell and rolled into her. That was
five years ago, and the woman still sometimes walks with
debilitating back pain. She has not skied since.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who asked not to be identified, knows that she was
just unlucky and that most people do not have such accidents. It
would be unfair to single out the ski area since such accidents can
and do happen anywhere, and the area believes it did as much as it
could to prevent such accidents, and responded quickly and
professionally to the woman and her injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the highly publicized deaths of Sonny Bono and
Michael Kennedy last season, safety awareness on the slopes has had
a real boost, according to Steven Over, executive director of the
National Ski Patrol in Lakewood, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Accidents such as the above collision _ which put one skier out
of the sport but did not result in life-threatening injury _ are by
far the most common, though there are few reliable figures
recorded. Nor is there much record-keeping on such minor but common
injuries as wrenched knees and broken thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Two studies are under way to determine if a correlation exists
between parabolic shaped skis and leg injuries, but so far no
conclusions have emerged.
</P>
<P>
   So as to the question of how safe you are on ski slopes, the
numbers, says Over, show what they have for several years: that the
incidence rate of death and catastrophic injury places skiing well
behind bike riding and even golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to make raw number comparisons with other
activities,'' says Over, ``but statistically skiing is safer now
than it has been, and safer than many other outdoor activities.
There is a high risk group (males 18-25), but then there are skiers
out there who were pioneers _ skiing after the war (World War II),
when it was becoming popular. Those people have never had safety
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   An example: Overall fatalities for the 1996-'97 season stood at
27 nationally, against 54.1 million skier visits. It was a year
well below average.
</P>
<P>
   During the last 13 years, Over points out, an average of 34
skiers have died per year out of the 52.5 million average skier
days.
</P>
<P>
   The other figure that the National Ski Patrol has closely
monitored is in the serious injury category (paraplegic,
quadraplegic, serious head injuries, comas, and other spinal
injuries). These occur at the rate of about 29 per year, according
to NSP, with last season being above average with 45 serious
injuries, or .86 per million skier/snowboarder visits.
</P>
<P>
   Further breaking down the numbers, 37 of them were males, and
nine were snowboarders.
</P>
<P>
   Although, as NSP points out, there is no real significance to
such comparisons, the following figures put skiing and boarding in
some perspective: Each year 42,000 Americans die in car accidents,
22,000 are murdered, 13,000 fall to their deaths (300 in bathtubs),
6,500 are poisoned, 2,900 choke on food, 800 die from falling
objects (about the same number while bike riding), and about 90 die
from lightning strikes, a figure that includes many golfers.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons with other sports are even more revealing. Last
year, skiing had 2.4 deaths per million participants while biking
had 15.5 per million, swimming 25.2 per million, scuba diving 35.4
per million, and boating 59.6 per million registered vessels.
</P>
<P>
   According to Over and figures from the National Sporting Goods
Association, the profile of the high-risk skier has been virtually
unchanged in the 13 years since these figures have been recorded.
Victims are predominantly male (85 percent) and fall between late
teenage and late 20s (70 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Acording to Rochester Institute of Technology professor Jasper
Shealy, who has studied skier injuries extensively, most deaths
follow roughly the same pattern as that which killed both Kennedy
and Bono. Most are better than average skiers who are skiing at
high rates of speed on the edges of intermediate trails.
</P>
<P>
   Expert skiers and even sub-experts on double diamond trails are
much lower in the death and serious injury category. Hence, say the
experts, the critical element seems to be a combination of skier
speed and a low margin of error, since the edge of the trail places
him too near the trees.
</P>
<P>
   And why is he out there? Partly because the snow is better on
the edges, but also, says Over:
</P>
<P>
   ``In years when there is lots of snow, skiers spread out. But
years that started like this one in the East, they're all bunched
up on the limited number of trails open.''
</P>
<P>
   Skier crowding forces some _ usually those who want to ski
faster _ out to the edges of the trails, the danger zone for
speeding skiers.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, says Shealy, the exact profile of the high-risk
skier turns up in other areas. They suffered 74 percent of all
deaths in car accidents and 85 percent of all industrial accidents.
Males compose 60 percent of all skiers and boarders.
</P>
<P>
   The overall rate of reported non-serious injuries has dropped by
50 percent in the last 25 years, says Shealy, and the much-feared
broken lower leg has virtually disappeared as a risk _ down more
than 95 percent in the last two deacades, a number that reflects
the new boot and binding technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most persistent injury spots in skiing, however,
remains the anterior cruciate ligament, which crosses the knee at a
diagonal angle below the kneecap. According to the University of
Vermont's Department of Orthopedics, a skier's chance of suffering
an ACL injury is about equal to that of a college football player,
some 365 times greater than the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Though death and injury figures are relatively low in skiing,
the National Ski Areas Association has stepped up its effort to
enforce the responsibility code, and several areas are strict about
maintaining low speed zones on trails that are popular with a mix
of ability levels.
</P>
<P>
   And the recent focus on helmet use will, says Over, result in
safer skiing. ``We're trying to push helmet use into the
mainstream,'' he says. ``They do help in certain cases, though we
want to keep it a free choice. If we could mandate the high risk
group wear helmets, that might help, but obviously we can't do
that.''

THE WAR CONTINUES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are two words you haven't seen in a while: Browser wars.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, journalists like me loved to handicap the titanic
struggle between Microsoft Corp. and Netscape Communications Corp.
for dominance of the Internet browser market. Then, suddenly, many
of us lost interest. The Netscape-Microsoft story got swallowed up
in the larger antitrust fight between Microsoft and the federal
government. And then America Online Inc. struck a deal to buy
Netscape, a decision interpreted by many as an act of surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly; in fact, the struggle continues. Netscape will soon be
under new management, and its strategy in the browser fight has
certainly changed. But the company is still clinging to the 50
percent share of the market belonging to its Communicator browser,
and it's even trying to squeeze out a profit from Web surfers
who've gone over to the enemy's Internet Explorer (IE).
</P>
<P>
   I've already written of Smart Browsing, a Netscape feature that
lets you find popular sites by simply typing a product name into
the Communicator address bar. Type ``Mercedes Benz,'' for instance,
and you go straight to the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape once would have used this feature to keep customers
from defecting to the Microsoft browser. These days, the company is
more interested in driving traffic to its Netcenter Web site. After
all, browsers are now given away, but companies pay by the eyeball
to advertise on Netcenter. The more visitors to the site, the more
profit for Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   And that explains Netscape TuneUp for IE, a free program that
adds Smart Browsing to Microsoft's browser. Along the way, TuneUp
resets the browser's home page to the Netcenter site, where you're
hit with advertisements urging you to sign up for a free e-mail
account.
</P>
<P>
   It's a clever way to snatch eyeballs from the competition, and
it works. I still use the Microsoft browser on my Windows machines,
but thanks to Netscape TuneUp, I'm now a regular at Netcenter.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape plans to pull a similar trick with Smart Download, a
freebie for pulling down files from the Internet. It's good for
people with only one phone line, because Smart Download has an
interrupt feature. You can halt a download in midstream, make a
call, and restart where you left off.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Smart Download is available only through the Netscape
browser, but the company says it'll soon offer a version compatible
with IE. Why? Because Smart Download bombards users with Netscape
ads as it runs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Microsoft's goal in the browser wars has never
changed _ total domination. Its new browser tweaks are aimed at
getting you to use IE and only IE. And not just on Windows
machines.
</P>
<P>
   I've been a loyal Netscape user on my Apple iMac, but
Microsoft's sharp new IE 4.5 browser for the Mac has me thinking
thoughts of treason. Browsing software brings out the best in
Microsoft's coders, and its new Mac browser has a bunch of powerful
new features.
</P>
<P>
   Registering on Internet shopping sites or free e-mail services
gets a lot easier, thanks to a feature called AutoFill. The browser
stores your name, address, and other personal data. When a site
requests this information, click the AutoFill button and the the
form is filled out automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Printing Web documents can be an ugly business. IE 4.5 fixes
that with features that'll make any Web page look good on paper.
For instance, you can resize the type to make it fit properly, and
delete background colors and ad banners before printing.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Page Holder, which lets you store favorite pages in
a sidebar to the left of the main browser window. Plug in the home
pages of favorite Web sites, like CNN.com or Boston.com. Click a
link on the home page, and the main browser window takes you there,
while your home page stays in the sidebar. You can travel all over
the Web, without leaving the place you started.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Microsoft being so nice to us? Like Netscape, the
company's ultimate goal is to drive Web traffic to Microsoft-owned
sites. That's the imperative that now drives the new, improved
browser wars. And that's why both Netscape and Microsoft will
continue to tempt us with new and improved browsers.

ON POLLARD STORY, WHO IS USING WHOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Old New Yorker editor Tina Brown liked . New editor David
Remnick is more likely to dabble in Middle Eastern intrigue. But
thanks to investigative reporter Seymour Hersh, Remnick is proving
he can create the same high-voltage shockwaves as his storied
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A is Hersh's January 18 New Yorker story, ``The
Traitor,'' which makes the case against freeing Jonathan Pollard,
the former Navy employee serving a life sentence for spying for
Israel. Pollard became a cause celebre when Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu injected the issue of his release into October's
tortuous Wye peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   And Hersh's story has become a lightning rod in its own right.
On one hand, it's viewed as a strong message delivered by U.S.
officials worried that Bill Clinton might free Pollard. On the
other, it's sparked protests from Pollard supporters in the U.S.
and Israel and a charge by his former lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, that
Hersh feasted off classified leaks designed to torpedo Pollard's
chances for clemency. (Dershowitz, along with writer Elie Wiesel
and World Jewish Congress President Edgar Bronfman, have reportedly
asked for a meeting with Clinton to argue for releasing Pollard.)
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Traitor,'' Hersh reports that U.S. officials believe
``Pollard . . . had done far more damage to American national
security than was ever made known to the public'' and that many of
them ``stongly suspect that the Israelis repackaged much of
Pollard's material and provided it to the Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   That story coincided with news reports this week that national
security officials were telling President Clinton to keep Pollard
behind bars. But not everyone greeted it with open arms.
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz insists he has it on good authority, including from
the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, that there is
``absolutely nothing to the claim that Israel gave (Pollard)
material to the Soviet Union.'' But he is also exorcised about what
he sees as an attempt by intelligence sources to do in Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department ``must open up a criminal investigation
of Sy Hersh's sources,'' he says. ``They've really done what
Pollard did. They're giving classified material to a journalist. .
. . This is not a story that popped up. People called Hersh and
said `we want you to (write this).' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never begrudge Alan Dershowitz his take,'' responds Hersh,
who acknowledges he got an unsual degree of help on the Pollard
story, which was inspired in part by ``an Israeli contact who came
to me after Wye.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden I get cooperation,'' Hersh says. ``Why are
these guys talking to me now? It's really simple. They don't think
Bill Clinton is going to do the right thing. . . . There was a
confluence here. I did what a lot of people wanted me to.''
</P>
<P>
   On that point, at least, he and Dershowitz agree.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How appropriate that when Larry Flynt held his Monday press
conference to dish dirt on GOP Congressman Bob Barr, Matt Drudge
was there to grill the Hustler publisher on his ties to the White
House. For this was the week in which Drudge and Flynn produced a
primer on the pitfalls of the new media universe.
</P>
<P>
   On his Web site, Drudge was gleefully posting dispatches about a
paternity test being conducted by the Star supermarket tabloid to
prove that Bill Clinton had fathered the 13-year-old son of a
former prostitute. (Sample headline: ``White House hit with new DNA
terror.'') The only problem, as Drudge acknowledged on Sunday, was
that the results ruled Clinton out as the father.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Flynt _ with former House Speaker-elect Bob
Livingston's pelt hanging from his gunbelt _ continued his reign of
checkbook journalism terror. On Monday, he charged that vocal
Clinton foe and antiabortion activist Barr declined to answer
questions during divorce proceedings about whether he'd had an
extramarital affair and paid for an ex-wife's abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got eight remaining investigations that I feel very
strongly about,'' Flynt told Geraldo Rivera Monday. ``And if they
materialize, the Republican Party will be in shambles.''
</P>
<P>
   Drudge and Flynt are cutting-edge icons in this era of
democratized journalism that has replaced the mainstream media
gatekeepers. They are two anti-establishment figures with
ideological agendas who use the Internet and cable news networks to
peddle their product. Yet media analysts see them not as symbols of
progression, but of regression.
</P>
<P>
   Fordham University communications professor Everette Dennis says
Drudge and Flynt conjure up ``the dark ages of American
journalism'' in the 19th Century when the press was partisan,
pugnacious and purposely inaccurate. ``Brill's Content'' publisher
Steven Brill says they recall the days of ``Colonial America when
you had hundreds of guys standing on streetcorners handing out
leaflets.'' Adds American Journalism Review editor Rem Rieder:
``There's a reason God invented gatekeepers.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least there's the consolation that Flynt and Drudge both
damaged themselves this week. Flynt's Barr bombshell was largely
seen as a dud, and by Tuesday he was grumbling to Larry King that
people weren't taking his revelations seriously enough. As for
Drudge, he was reduced to defending his bogus story by charging
racism. Since the mother of Clinton's supposed love child was
black, he labels the media's disinterest in the story ``a racial
problem . . . For those who would say Drudge should not report
that, well someone should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Drudge lose a journalism ethics contest to the
Star, which never published the love child article. (``We could
fill the book with stories that didn't check out,'' snorts Star
editor Phil Buntin.) He even finished second to Flynt.
</P>
<P>
   At least Flynt was ``doing his own `journalism,' '' such as it
is, says Brill. ``Drudge is simply a parasite.''

MIA CHUNG'S CLASSICAL PASSAGE

 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The turning point for Mia Chung came during a Boston Pops
telecast when she was 9. Arthur Fiedler was featuring a 9-year-old
prodigy named Anne-Marie Vera in a Haydn concerto.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Chung was 9 years old herself. ``Up until that
moment, I thought I was good, playing `The Entertainer' and my
other little pieces,'' she recalls. ``I would get home from school,
throw my bookbag down, and go outside to play instead of
practicing. That Pops program was the beginning of my daily
discipline. It was time to try and see what would happen if I
applied myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Chung has done very well for herself. A winner of the
prestigious Concert Artists Guild Competition and the Avery Fisher
Career Grant, Chung, 34, has played with the National and Baltimore
symphonies; toured Tonga, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan
as an ``artistic ambassador'' of the US Information Agency; and
recorded three CDs for Holland's Channel Classics label. The
enthusiastic international reception for those CDs has led to
engagements in Amsterdam, Utrecht, Parma, and also in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Since her student days at Harvard (class of '86), Chung has
regularly appeared locally, at the Gardner Museum, at Harvard, and
other venues. In 1995, she became a household name in households
that listen to WCRB-FM _ she served that station as ``artist in
radio.'' Today she teaches at Gordon College in Wenham, Mass.,
where she is artist-in-residence, maintains a busy schedule of
about 30 recital, concerto, and chamber-music appearances a year,
and rides herd on an active 2-year-old son, Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   Chung grew up in Bethesda, Md. Her parents anticipated the great
wave of Korean students coming to America for graduate work. In
Madison, Wis., they became fans of television's ``Peyton Place,''
so she was named in part for Mia Farrow. ``Besides that, the two
syllables of `Mi-a' mean very nice things in Korean,'' Chung says,
smiling, during a lunchtime interview this week. ``They mean
`beauty' and `grace.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Chung explains that her father loves to paint in oils, and her
mother played the piano, but the idea of a professional involvement
in the arts was something new to her family. ``I didn't start until
late, for a pianist _ I was nearly 8. After church, I was playing
`The Entertainer' by ear, and my parents decided maybe I should
take some lessons. They bought a piano, an Everett spinet with a
very light action, and I sat outside on the curb for four hours
waiting for the delivery van to come. When the piano came inside, I
didn't have time to eat dinner; suddenly nothing else seemed
important. Unfortunately, I got bored very soon. That was because I
played better by ear than I did by following notation. It just
didn't seem worth the bother. But then came that Pops television
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Chung's first teacher was the music director at her church.
Later she worked with Marjory Sparks, who had studied at the Curtis
Institute of Music in Philadelphia. ``She was a very fine teacher
who took me under her wing. I had three lessons a week; she would
pick me up after school, and for several years that was my regular
routine. When I was 12, I played a movement of the Mendelssohn
D-Minor Concerto with the Baltimore Symphony. There were four
performances, and after the third, I was depressed because there
was only one left. I discovered I really liked doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Chung coached with Ilana Vered and at 16 went to work
with George Manos at the National Gallery in Washington. ``He made
a formidable input into my life, because with him for the first
time I experienced the freedom to make decisions. Before that I
would do what I was told. `This is what you do,' my teachers would
say, and then I would mimic it. I was working on a lot of Bach
then, and George Manos kept giving me choices. `This is too hard,'
I kept thinking. But that training was the beginning of my pursuit
of musical truths.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chung chose Harvard over a conservatory because she had ``cold
feet'' about the possibility of making a career as a pianist. ``I
loved the sciences, so I was thinking premed. I figured that music
would withstand the challenge of Harvard if that was what I was
meant to do. Within a month, it was clear to me how much I missed
music, so I became a music major. At Harvard that meant I could
study everything but performance _ theory and analysis and history,
although I did work on performance issues with Leon Kirchner and
Luise Vosgerchian. I also commuted regularly to Hartford to take
lessons with Raymond and Anne Hanson. I lived two separate lives _
performing and preparing for competitions and studying at Harvard,
and some days I told myself I was insane. What was I trying to do?
It was too late to think about premed anymore, but I was
considering prelaw.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing the Peabody-Mason Competition when she was a sophomore
marked another pivotal moment for Chung. ``I had worked like a dog,
and was simply a runner-up. I was beside myself with disappointment
_ but I also knew, finally, that I didn't want to change
direction.'' Nevertheless, Chung chose not to go to any of the
elite summer musical encampments; instead she deliberately took
nonmusical jobs in the World Bank and at Washington's National
Gallery. ``I wanted to know what other people did with their
lives,'' Chung explains.
</P>
<P>
   Chung went to Yale for her first graduate study with Boris
Berman, then completed her doctorate at Juilliard, where her
teacher was Peter Serkin. ``I was always working with forceful
personalities, who gave me so many options that I was sometimes
utterly confused. For me, the process was about arriving at my own
perspective, my own voice. Peter Serkin was particularly helpful
for that; he did not impose his own ideas. He would take what you
came in with and helped you create a new thing out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Chung returned to the Boston area to work at Gordon
College. ``At that point, I stopped studying with other people; my
job was to find where I wanted to be, what I wanted to say.'' At
Gordon, Chung teaches four courses, coaches six private students,
and performs at least twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most important of her victories was in the Concert
Artists Guild competition. Under the direction of Ellen Highstein,
who later became director of the Tanglewood Music Center, the
Concert Artists Guild tried to create a prize that would award more
than money and concert dates. In addition, it supplies management
services and tries to help young performers in the hard work of
building a career in today's volatile musical world. Chung's
residency at WCRB was arranged by the Concert Artists Guild, for
example. That residency brought with it regular appearances in
inner-city schoolrooms. ``It was an easy, casual format _ I would
always invite one of the kids to come up and play a duet with me.
Whenever I go into the schools I am still surprised at the
instinctive and overwhelmingly positive response that kids
invariably bring to music. The pie of today's musical world is very
small, and the superstars have carved out very big slices for
themselves. It is part of my job, I think, to help enlarge the
pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Another part of Chung's Concert Artists Guild prize was the
opportunity to make a first recording for Channel Classics. The
disc of Beethoven sonatas and bagatelles proved so successful that
Chung has followed it up with two more (another Beethoven volume
and a Schumann disc); Bach's ``Goldberg'' Variations awaits release
in the spring. ``I knew it would be difficult to persuade anyone to
record me in the standard repertory, but I had been studying
Beethoven a lot and I was invested in this music. The option was to
do something more obscure _ who needs another Beethoven Op. 111? _
but I felt challenged to prove myself in the standard repertory.''
</P>
<P>
   Chung has always been interested in new music; she wrote her
doctoral disseration on the recent piano concertos by Peter
Lieberson, Joan Tower, and Ellen Taaffe Zwilich. Another dimension
of her Concert Artists Guild prize was the opportunity to
commission a new piece; her choice fell on Boston composer Lee
Hyla, who obliged with a substantial seven-movement, 20-minute
piece that figures on Chung's recital program Sunday. ``I've played
it several times now, but this will be the Boston premiere. I
listened to a lot of music by more than 150 composers before I
heard the Hyla concerto, and found someone who was really writing
for the piano.'' Chung's program also includes Mendelssohn's
``Andante and Rondo Capriccioso,'' Liszt's transcription of
Schumann's song ``Widmung,'' and two Beethoven sonatas, Op. 110 and
the ``Waldstein.''
</P>
<P>
   Chung met her husband, John Yee, when they were sophomores at
Harvard; today he is a pediatrician at Boston Children's Hospital.
The birth of their son was another turning point in a life that has
been as full of them as it has been full of unswerving dedication.
``It is truly thrilling to see Nathan's perception of everything,''
Chung says. ``What I have learned from music makes me a better
mother and what I've learned from him makes me a better musician. I
don't take the simple things for granted anymore because I see them
the way he sees them _ motherhood has been an eye-opening and
miraculous process.''

HIS GUTTERS KEEP COMING LOOSE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Q. The spikes holding my gutters are loosening and I'm afraid I
will lose the gutters. I drive the spikes back into position and
they hold awhile, but not for long. How can I get them to stay?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN ROCH, Stoughton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The spikes loosened because the wood fascia board into which
they are driven expanded and contracted with water content. They
also loosened if they were driven into just the 3/4-inch fascia
board and not also the rafter ends. If you drive the spikes into
the rafter ends, chances are good that they will hold. Another
solution is to buy special 8-inch screws that can be driven into
the holes left by the old spikes, or into newly drilled holes in
the rafter ends. The screws come with a ferrule that fits inside
the gutter, and a special tool to drive them. They are 10 for
$12.99 in the Improvements Catalog (800-642-2112).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having a hot-air furnace installed, but the installer
said it is too small for the size of the house, and will wear out
quickly, just as the original one did. The options, he said, are to
put in a bigger furnace in the basement, or keep the smaller one in
the basement and put in another in the attic. Is this feasible?
</P>
<P>
   B.B., Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is feasible, all right, but not practical, and I suggest
that you do not put a furnace in the attic. A bigger one in the
basement should be adequate to provide enough heat and it will last
longer than the original. After all, thousands of furnaces and
heating systems have been installed in the basements of small,
medium, and large houses with the ability to heat the entire space.
</P>
<P>
   Some large houses have been built recently with hot-air furnaces
in both basement and attic. Two furnaces work well in heating a
large house, but one in the attic can cause problems such as ice
dams, from warm roofs. The roofs are made warm because, while the
attic furnaces themselves are well insulated, the open flame of the
furnace cannot be insulated, and the heat from the flame makes the
attic and the roof warm. This encourages the development of ice
dams and resulting leaks when snow piles up on the roof and the
water backs up above the dams, even if the attic is properly
ventilated.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the handyman's opinion, no furnaces in the attic.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some of the bluestone blocks I replaced in a walkway have
white chalk marks. How can I remove those marks? I tried bleach,
then detergent and water, without success.
</P>
<P>
   JIM OFRIA, Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Since chalk is made of limestone, then muriatic acid should
do it in the wink of an eye. The acid attacks the lime in chalk; it
also attacks lime in concrete, mortar, grout, and efflorescence
(white stains) on concrete foundation walls. It is used to remove
excess or spilled mortar.
</P>
<P>
   Mix the acid half and half with water and apply it with a
paintbrush, or pour it on the chalked areas. After it stops
fizzing, hose it off. When mixing acid and water, always pour the
acid into the water. And wear skin and eye protection when working
with bleach.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to put a wood floor in my kitchen. Should I finish it
with water-based polyurethane varnish or oil-based?
</P>
<P>
   ED FARR, Newton Centre, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Oil-based, by all means, if you are going to do it yourself.
Three coats will do well. If you are having it done professionally,
I suggest the installers use a moisture-cured polyurethane.
</P>
<P>
   Or, buy prefinished boards, and specify that they have three or
four coats, factory applied. These boards are a little more
expensive than the bare wood, but they don't have to be sanded and
varnished.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Fran Olfe of Brookline, Mass. asked how to maintain newly
polyurethaned floors, and especially how to handle scuff marks, the
handyuman suggested dry mopping and vacuuming, with a bit of damp
mopping for stubborn spots. And for the scuff marks, light rubbing
with a soap pad or steel wool and oil.
</P>
<P>
   That's OK as far as it went, but Eileen Padua of Dorchester,
Mass. wrote to share her method, adding, ``I think this is the
third time I've told you this over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mop and Glo in the blue bottle used sparingly with a damp mop
or cloth will clean scuff marks and make minor scratches disappear.
I do it once every couple of months and have never had any
buildup,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had polyurethaned wood floors 25 years old that have
had no other treatment. I also use Mop and Glo on floors I had
sanded and polyurethaned last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Eileen Padua, for the third time. Now your tip is in
the handyman's handy-dandy file for future reference.

KEEP CHIMNEY VINE BUT TRIM THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. A vine is growing up the outside of my chimney, right to the
top. I was told to take it down because the vine holds water
against the brick and mortar, hastening their deterioration.
Doesn't the chimney get too warm for water to stay?
</P>
<P>
   LESLIE GLYNN, Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think you can leave it in place, although it would be wise
to cut it a few feet down from the top, to keep it from
overwhelming the top of the chimney. While constant water against
mortar may promote decay of the mortar, it would take a long, long
time to do so, and it will not hurt most bricks. Your theory about
the chimney being warm enough to evaporate some of the water is
valid, but it does not apply when the burner is not on, which is
perhaps four months out of the year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I installed a good door to help insulate my garage because it
is under a bedroom, which gets quite cold because of the coldness
in the garage. The door works fine but water comes in under it. How
can I prevent that water from coming in, or drain it away?
</P>
<P>
   PAT MULLALY, Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You could drain the water into a small dry well on the garage
floor, but that would allow water contaminated by grease and oil to
go into ground water under the garage floor _ and may be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   There are other ways:
</P>
<P>
   --Build a small berm of concrete at the garage opening, and
reset your door to close on this berm. The berm, just a few inches
high, can be concrete set in a groove cut in the garage floor, or
it could be a thick wood threshold, held down with steel
reinforcing rods or bolts driven through the threshold into the
concrete floor, and caulked. You might get a little bump when you
drive your car into the garage, but that is a minor obstacle, and
the berm or wood threshold can be sloped on each side to ease the
bump.
</P>
<P>
   --This might be the better solution because it could prevent
water from getting to the garage in the first place: Dig a shallow
trench, say 12 inches deep and 12 inches wide, just outside the
garage opening, going the full width of the driveway. Water will
then fill the trench and drain downward before it reaches the
garage. Cover the trench with a steel grille.
</P>
<P>
   If the berm or trench alone fails to solve the problem, try both
together. A trench would be a good idea on the outside of the berm
to prevent water from building up against it.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the airtight garage door will help keep the
bedroom less cold but only to a small degree. Make sure the garage
ceiling is insulated. There is little else you can do, unless you
add a little heat to the garage, which can be quite wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I get ink off a leather dashboard in a minivan? I
don't know what kind of ink it is.
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE PARMENTER, Oxford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Without knowing what kind of ink it is, you will have to
experiment. Try rubbing alcohol first. Or, rub lightly with
toothpaste or mechanic's gel soap. Or, a solution of ammonia and
water. As with all potential cleaners, try them in an obscure area
to make sure they don't damage the rest of the dashboard. Some ink
fighters have used hair spray successfully; it is the alcohol in
the hair spray that does it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some of the mortar in my basement foundation is crumbling on
the inside. One mason said he would put wire lath over the wall and
cover it with stucco (more mortar); another said he would refill
the joints. Which is better to do?
</P>
<P>
   PAUL HOFFMAN, Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Assuming that your foundation is stone, it is not so much
that one is better than the other, because both will be effective
in keeping out air and cold, and making the wall a little more
weatherproof as well. I would opt for filling the joints with
mortar, called repointing. I think it would be less expensive than
putting up stucco, which is partly cosmetic and something you may
not need.
</P>
<P>
   If both jobs cost the same, then go for the stucco. The mason's
suggestion to attach wire lath to the wall before stuccoing is
great, because the lath will keep the stucco where it belongs,
against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   All the above applies if the foundation is made of concrete
blocks instead of stone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a number of steam radiators, which are not terribly
attractive. Can I put enclosures over them? What kind? Can I use a
wood enclosure on a steam radiator, which gets very hot?
</P>
<P>
   BRYAN HARRINGTON, Roslindale, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You not only can put enclosures over steam radiators (or any
other kind), but you can also use wood ones. Make sure there is no
wood touching the radiator. Check out ``Radiator Covers,
Enclosures'' in the Yellow Pages.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The exhaust fan in my windowless bathroom is rated at 2.5
sones, and it is really loud. It cannot be adjusted. How can I
muffle it?
</P>
<P>
   STEVE JONES, Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Much of the noise may be due to the fan forcing air through a
smaller-diameter duct going outdoors. Try enlarging the duct. Short
of that, buy a fan that is adjustable, or at least rated at a lower
sone level.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My sink stopper won't stay down. I push it down and it pops
right up again. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   BETTY ANN CHAMBERLIN, Shrewsbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Try picking it right out of the drain and washing it with
bleach; then pour a cup of bleach down the drain and clean that
with a oversize bottle brush. If that doesn't work, you can try
adjusting the mechanism under the sink. It usually is a pivot bar
attached to a shaft with holes in it. Move the bar over one hole
and see what happens. If there's no improvement, move the bar in
the opposite direction.

OH DEE DEE, DEAR DIVA, DO TELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Diva fever. Dee Dee's got it. Our all-purpose advice columnist
has always aspired to divadom, and now it's within her grasp
because these days everybody and her sister _ and her brother too _
can be a diva. The D-word is everywhere. But diva is more than just
a buzzword. It's a lifestyle. It's an attitude. It's a commitment.
It's a cliche. Dee Dee gives it another six months, tops.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Dee Dee is ready to answer all your diva-related
questions, as long as you ask with the utmost respect. Diva Dee Dee
doesn't require that you prostrate yourself before her, but a litle
groveling wouldn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee: what is it with all these divas all of a sudden?
The so-called singer/poet Jewel is on the cover of the current
Entertainment Weekly, referred to as ``the saintly diva.'' And this
week's People magazine has a whole gaggle of ``pop divas'' on it's
cover _ Mariah, Whitney, Celine, et al. What's going on? _
Divagating, Catkin, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The D-word has caught the media's imagination. The original
divas were opera singers, women of extraordinary talent who were
also extremely demanding. But these days just about any woman who
steps in front of a microphone is a diva. This adds up to an awful
lot of divas, so to speak. Are all these new divas talented? That's
a matter of opinion. Are they all pains in the neck? Dee Dee has no
idea, but she has her suspicions. And FYI, Dee Dee would like to
point out that's a pride of divas gracing People's cover, not a
gaggle. When you speak of divas, watch your language. And never
speak to a diva before she speaks to you.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee: I'm confused. I thought the word diva was another
way of saying drag queen. _ Distracted, Billfish, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're correct. For example, the late and very much lamented
Sylvia Sydney, Boston's legendary drag performer, was a diva of the
first magnitude. The word is Italian, from the Latin word diva,
which means goddess. There's a male equivalent, divo, Italian for
god, which has yet to catch on, unfortunately, because it has
possibilities. Dee Dee is very much in favor of equal opportunity
divadom. She feels grateful to live in a country where every little
boy and girl has the opportunity to grow up to be a diva.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee: I am interested in persuing a career as a diva.
Can you tell me what's required? Distrait, Overborne, ME
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the past becoming a diva required talent, drive,
determination. Perfectionism was the hallmark of the diva, which is
probably why they were so cranky all the time. The new divas may
also be talented and hardworking, but those qualities are not
prerequisites. These days anyone can become a diva just by adopting
the diva attitude. Look at Dee Dee. But don't stare. And please, no
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee: Is show business the only career in which one can
hope to become a diva? If I persue a career in computer science
must I give up my diva dream? _ Dithering, Quidnunc, MA
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. Every field has its divas. Martha Stewart is the
multi-media diva of domesticity. Diane Sawyer, Leslie Stahl,
Barbara Walters are TV news divas. There are fitness divas, fashion
divas, sports divas, comedy divas, political divas, etc. Miss Piggy
has proved that you don't even have to be human to be a diva. The
computer field would seem to offer excellent prospects for an
aspiring diva. You have Bill Gates as a role model.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee: I am distressed by what I perceive as divalution .
There are too many pretenders to divadom. I think we need a new
term to apply to legitimate divas, Barbra Streisand, for example.
How about superdiva? Disilluisoned, Spooney, VT
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee, superdiva. It has a certain ring.

ON `DREW CAREY' SET, A LABOR OF LAUGHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ From a corner of a darkened soundstage, Drew
Carey watched with a bemused grin as hundreds of spectators
whistled the theme to ``The Andy Griffith Show'' during a break in
the taping of Carey's sitcom Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   When the impromptu musical interlude was over, the burly
crew-cut star with the oversized eyeglasses strode past the cameras
and called out jokingly to the crowd: ``You trying to get us
canceled?''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, we've gotta do something to while away the time, Drew.
</P>
<P>
   As members of the studio audience discovered during four hours
of taping inside Stage 17 of the Warner Bros. lot, the making of a
half-hour sitcom _ even one as breezy and seemingly spontaneous as
ABC's ``The Drew Carey Show'' _ is a laborious, time-consuming,
repetitive process. Between technical glitches, scene and costume
changes, and actors flubbing their lines or failing to ``punch''
them to the director's satisfaction, there is a lot of downtime.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Dailey Pike comes in. Chances are you've never
heard of him, but to spectators attending the taping of a ``Drew
Carey'' episode that will air Feb. 10, the quick-witted Pike was
the star of the show behind the show. He's called the warm-up act,
but warming up the audience with jokes beforehand and introducing
the stars was just the beginning for Pike. From 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.,
whenever Carey and his costars took a break onstage, Pike swung
into action offstage, bounding from his red plastic seat in the
bleachers and firing off a steady stream of one-liners that kept
the crowd in a laughing mood.
</P>
<P>
   It's a key role, given that microphones are suspended overhead
to capture the laughter of the live audience _ laughter that
inevitably ebbs as spectators hear the same jokes take after take.
``Let those laughs go,'' Pike implored spectators. ``Save my job.''
When the first scene required three takes because actress Christa
Miller (Kate) was unable to assemble a massage chair central to the
scene, Pike urged the crowd to ``act as if you've never seen this
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Pike found plenty of material onstage. At one point he spotted
ex-Monkee Mickey Dolenz, a director of other sitcoms who attended
the taping, carrying a plate of food from the set that serves as
the Carey character's kitchen. ``Mickey Dolenz looting Drew's
kitchen!'' Pike cried in mock horror. ``Unbelievable!'' He then
said sternly to Dolenz: ``Put it baaack. Put it baaack.'' Dolenz
played along, shamefacedly tip-toeing back into the kitchen with
the food.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the klieg-lit handful of actors, the stage teemed with
camera operators, sound technicians, lighting engineers, makeup
experts, writers and producers, none of whom were safe from Pike's
barbs. ``See the gentleman walking in front of us with a clip-on?''
asked Pike. ``It's a clip-on.'' He mercilessly teased one actress
in her late 30s, labeling her the ``Black Widow'' as she chatted
during a break with a young actor. ``Mrs. Robinson has a new
boyfriend,'' Pike intoned. The actress turned her back on the
audience and pretended to moon Pike. When a youth in a cowboy hat
walked through the bleachers, Pike yelped: ``Holy cow, it's Garth
Brooks!'' The comedian kept insisting that a camera operator with a
bushy white beard was actually the ghost of Jerry Garcia. Pike also
introduced Jody Paul, the writer of the episode , saying the Feb.
10 episode was her first solo writing credit, while she hid in
embarrassment behind crew members onstage.
</P>
<P>
   To audience members who gamely performed animal impressions _ a
turkey, a pig, a Tasmanian devil,and a bizarre routine described by
its perpetrator as ``the Taco Bell Chihuahua chasing Godzilla'' _
Pike awarded pages of the show's script or bottles of the show's
trademark ``Buzz Beer.''
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, bored by the onstage delays or just curious, the
sitcom's stars were drawn to the offstage show. Carey and costars
Diedrich Bader (Oswald) and Ryan Stiles (Lewis) watched intently as
a teenager emerged from the audience and proceeded to deftly juggle
three balls, then three clubs. They joined the crew in applauding
when he finished. When a woman insisted on demonstrating her
earsplitting shouting ability, Carey, Bader, and Stiles clapped
their hands over their ears and rocked back and forth in pseudo
agony. At another point, Pike enticed Ian Gomez, who plays Larry,
Drew's hostile dweeb of a co-worker, to do the herky-jerky ``Larry
dance'' while the crowd sang ``(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your
Booty.'' While all this was going on, one of television's most
popular sitcoms was being painstakingly stitched together, fragment
by fragment. The episode is the first of a three-part story arc,
designed for February sweeps, that finds Drew, Oswald, and Lewis
all in love with the same woman. The first scene alone required two
complete takes and three ``pickups,'' in which an actor resumes
mid-scene after a line is flubbed. It took an hour just to tape the
first two scenes, which will take up only about five minutes of
on-air time.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Ferguson, who plays Mr. Wick, forgot his lines in the
opening scene and quickly executed an about-face through his office
door, cursing under his breath. (``We call it `pulling a Ferguson,'
'' Carey cracked after the show. ``He gets about three lines per
show and he always blows one.'') One encounter between Carey and
his nemesis Mimi (Kathy Kinney) got funnier when writers added new
dialogue between scenes. ``If it doesn't get a laugh, we'll change
the line,'' Carey explained, adding that fixing jokes is common,
but ``fixing whole scenes is a drag.''
</P>
<P>
   Spectators got to see the anatomy of a television show, with its
blend of professionalism, artificiality, and human error. Three
sets stood side by side in the cavernous Stage 17: the Warsaw bar
where Drew and his pals hang out, his living room, and his kitchen.
Four cameras tracked the actors, while 20 feet overhead, a
boom-mike operator dangled the mike over whomever was speaking. The
director called out instructions like ``Background: mime
conversation,'' which cued the extras in a barroom scene. Actor
exited doors that led to nothing but more scenery.
</P>
<P>
   There were unexpected flashes of reality amid the unreality,
though. For instance, the final scene required an extra take
because of a buzzing from Mimi's computer. Turns out it is an
actual computer, and Gomez had been playing a game of blackjack on
it during a break.
</P>
<P>
   After the show, Carey held court on the sound stage, attired in
a Cleveland Indians warm-up jacket. He proclaimed the night an
``average run-of-the-mill `Drew Carey' taping,'' noting that taping
for the pilot ran till 2 a.m. But was Carey distracted by the
running sideshow in the bleachers while he tried to get another
episode of his top-20 show in the can?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' he said. ``I only hear the silence.''

IS THERE MORE TO '99 THAN `STAR WARS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Believe it or not, the ``Star Wars'' prequel
won't be the only movie coming out in 1999. Why others are
bothering is another question entirely, but they'll be heading our
way nonetheless, often in big clumps.
</P>
<P>
   Like high school high jinks? Hope so, because starting with
today's release of ``Varsity Blues,'' there's a new teen movie set
to open just about every week between now and the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Miss the '60s? Have a nostalgia attack with big-screen versions
of such decade-defining TV shows as ``The Wild, Wild West''
(starring Will Smith), ``The Mod Squad,'' ``My Favorite Martian,''
``Dudley Do-Right'' and ``Mission: Impossible 2'' with Tom Cruise.
Also coming back is that ultimate man of his time in ``Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Think Southern folks are kooky? Billy Bob Thornton, Robert
Altman and Antonio Banderas all have made movies that will
reinforce your prejudices.
</P>
<P>
   Starting to worry that, in a movie year when all anybody really
cares about is going back to a universe far, far away, you'll have
no chance of seeing anything decent?
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least some of our best filmmakers have releases
scheduled for 1999. Of course, the last time that happened, the
movies turned out to be ``U-Turn'' and ``Kundun.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's every reason to believe that Martin Scorsese will
be back on his game with the paramedic-on-the-edge thriller,
``Bringing Out the Dead,'' and Oliver Stone will bring the proper
(dis)temperament to his pro football expose, ``Any Given Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the way are Spike Lee's already controversial ``The
Summer of Sam''; Ron Howard's ``Truman''-esque ``EDtv''; Frank
Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's ``The Green Mile'' with Tom
Hanks; Johnny Depp-starring horror movies from Tim Burton (``Sleepy
Hollow'') and Roman Polanski (``The Ninth Gate''); Anthony
Minghella's psycho thriller ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' with Matt
Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow; and Danny Boyle's Leonardo DiCaprio
showcase, ``The Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most anticipated film of the year _ well,
second-most anticipated _ is Stanley Kubrick's long-awaited,
long-delayed ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' The master director's first
picture in a dozen years, well over two years in the making, the
top-secret Tom Cruise-Nicole Kidman starrer had better be worth the
wait.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice if that outer space movie from the guy who
hasn't directed anything in 22 years is worth the wait, too. Not
that it's gonna matter either way to George Lucas' bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   The following list of 1999 movie release dates is as complete
and accurate as we could make it up through May 21, when ``Star
Wars'' will definitely hit North America, followed by highlights of
films scheduled for later in the year. All dates that do not have
the Force with them are subject to change. &QL;

   You wouldn't think to look at it that the lampshade was a party
animal. For more than a century it has led an exemplary life,
content to protect us from the glare of gaslight or electricity,
glad to be seen but not seen, and its only character flaw a
tendency to catch dust. But the lampshade can be led astray. In the
wee hours, after much strong drink and madder music, some people
think it's the greatest fun in the world to put on a lampshade. A
lampshade over the head reduces the rest of the party to helpless
mirth. Someone might then seize a lamp and waltz with it. Someone
else finds a standing lamp and croons into it like an old-time
microphone. Thus was born karaoke.
</P>
<P>
   The grander the lampshade, the more it invited being worn. A
natural was the bulbous Victorian jobby with fringe that childish
fingers liked to plait. Or the frou-frou shade with more ruffles
than Carmen Miranda. Social historians think donning the lampshade
took an intermission when people took to drinking white wine. When
you're pacing yourself over a glass of overpriced plonk, you just
don't get the urge. Minimalist decor, with its plain-Jane shades,
was also to blame.
</P>
<P>
   We may be in for a modest revival of partying lampshades. The
bars are full of young things drinking vile-colored cocktails. (The
next thing you know they will be punishing the parquet.) This
giddiness is matched in shops in Boston's Back Bay with stocks of
lampshades that hark back to the days when the electric light was
new. There are shades dripping beads. There are shades sleek with
feathers, like the ``cocktail'' hats of the 1930s. There are lamps
whose shades make a slide show. One lamp is actually a straw hat.
Most of these, it's fair to say, are novelties. The
one-per-household kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not all shades can be bought without the lamp that goes with
them. Other shades are to use with candles, and in some ways the
shade hasn't changed in a century.
</P>
<P>
   For most of our life on earth, we've been trying to improve and
increase natural light. First came the primitive wick in oil, then
the candle, a wick in wax or tallow. But so little light did they
give off, there was not much need to shade the glow. Back to oil _
whale as well as paraffin, a waxy kerosene _ to fuel lamps whose
brightness could be regulated. Families gathered around the parlor
table with its standing or hanging lamp. Some liked the forced
intimacy, some didn't. Gaslight brightened the entire house because
it could be piped where needed and people could spread out. With
the blaze of electricity, shadows vanished. Also the coziness of
home. Not everyone liked the glare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electric light bulbs came into the world naked,'' observes
William Seale, whose wonderful book ``The Tasteful Interlude:
American Interiors Through the Camera's Eye, 1860-1917'' (Praeger,
1975) records home decor from Nome, Alaska, to Beacon Street,
Boston. ``The question of how to cover the bulbs, or whether to
cover them, produced many kinds of answers,'' Seale writes.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you chose to brag on having Mr. Edison's invention.
You left your bulbs unshaded, the ``if you've got it, flaunt it''
approach. That was true for the Ayer mansion t 395 Commonwealth
Ave., Boston, now the Bayridge Residence for college women. There,
an arch of bare bulbs outlined the staircase, which had been tiled
about 1902 by designer Louis Comfort Tiffany. As Mrs. Ayer
sometimes used the steps and first landing as a little theater,
this parade of bulbs suggested the drama of the proscenium. A
circle of bulbs lit the rotunda over the staircase of the James
Campbell mansion in St. Louis in 1916. Given the setting, this
corona of light made architectural sense.
</P>
<P>
   Bellefontaine was another matter. Now the Canyon Ranch health
spa in Lenox, this ``cottage'' was built in 1896 to look like the
Petit Trianon at Versailles. This grandeur cost Giraud Foster a
cool $2.5 million. He was rich but a dim bulb, some people thought,
and a wag dubbed him ``Zero,'' which rhymed with his French first
name. Versailles would have been candlelit, the flames dancing off
gilt and multiplied by mirrors. But with George Westinghouse as
their neighbor, the Lenox swells competed to install electricity.
The Mount, novelist Edith Wharton's estate, was the first in Lenox
to be wired as it was built. Vintage photos of Bellefontaine show
the dining room outlined in bare bulbs and the chandelier studded
with them. So much for the romance of dining by candlelight, not to
mention the wisdom. Bright light can be cruel to all but young
faces.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The gaslight era knew that and softened the glare with frosted
globes that also diffused light. Incidentally, for people who need
to date old photos, Seale has a handy way of telling gas fixtures
from retrofitted electric. Gas burned upward (on a saturated cotton
``sock''). Electric wall sconces were crook-necked, the bulb
screwing in at an angle to the wall. Think of gas as a hyacinth in
shape and electricity a trumpet flower.
</P>
<P>
   In the Victorian clutter of most rooms, gas lampshades vied to
be seen. It's easy to see the lady's hat style, all cabbage roses,
that must have inspired Mrs. Frederick Shear's piano lamp in
Skaneateles, N.Y., about 1885, or the fashionable fringe of hair in
a Virginia piano lamp, circa 1890. Tiered petticoats dressed a
table lamp when Mrs. Edward J. Lowell's sitting room on
Commonwealth Avenue was photographed in 1897.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity would eventually hanker for the days of candlelight:
By 1910, bulbs shaped as flames were available for wall sconces and
chandeliers. All bulbs would become frosted, and match use with
wattage, 25-40 at the low end for general light and 100-150 at the
high end for reading. As for the shades themselves, the material
pretty much determined the quality and direction of light. Opaque
shades meant light issued at the top and the bottom. Translucent
material permitted shades to glow and light to scatter.

SENIORS GO ON LINE TO TAP A FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, N.Y. _ In the club room of Beverwyck, an upscale
retirement community, all cherry wood and pastels, Rose Frank and
Franklin Cross are stationed at two personal computers, she playing
an especially challenging version of solitaire, he struggling to
compose an electronic mail message.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, 77, is a whiz. In November, she ditched her upgraded,
five-year-old 286 _ ``it was too slow,'' she said, flatly, always
bouncing her off line _ for a new Dell that runs Windows 98 and has
the latest, fastest modem.
</P>
<P>
   Cross, 87, is a novice who uses his 10-year-old, outdated Tandy
at home for word processing, compiling reports on his genealogy
research or finances. Icons clearly are difficult for him to read;
e-mail, which he writes only infrequently on the Beverwyck's
computer, still is a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Cross sees the potential: His wife, always adept at the
strategic game Battleship, now plays a computerized version with a
young nephew, and Cross himself occasionally yearns for better
computer access, longingly scanning the newspaper classified ads
and sometimes visiting computer stores.
</P>
<P>
   Frank and Cross are prime examples of how computers have touched
their generation, people in their mid-60s to 80s who had little or
no exposure to computers when they were young.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, computer ownership among older people drops
precipitously after age 60, according to the U.S. Department of
Commerce. A 1994 survey showed that 30 percent of people ages 50 to
60 owned computers; after age 60, it dropped to 16 percent, and
then to 7 percent for people between 70 and 80 years old.
</P>
<P>
   As the new millennium approaches, the survivors of the
Depression and World War II now are confronting the computer,
sometimes with ease, sometimes with trepidation and sometimes with
downright fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how timid most senior citizens are about computers.
They're terrified, generally speaking,'' said Frank, who every
Saturday coaches fellow residents in Beverwyck's new effort to coax
its clients on line. Frank uses her computer to track her finances
and communicate with family. She is graduating in prowess, and is
now contemplating using her stock brokers' on-line services.
</P>
<P>
   Unfamiliarity with computers, combined with poorer eyesight or
slower hands of some older people, set up a particularly imposing
obstacle for seniors. Consequently, both nonprofit and private
businesses have developed training especially geared to seniors who
are stuck on getting started.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that perhaps 10 of its 225 residents had computers,
and that fewer still accessed the Internet, Beverwyck
administration last spring installed two 24-hour computer stations
and hired Webtop.systems.inc of Syracuse, N.Y., to intensively
coach the residents.
</P>
<P>
   At Beverwyck, where, generally, residents are well off, retired
professionals who live independently, about 60 people have been
trained for free and have unlimited access to the computers. The 50
free e-mail accounts that Webtop offered are mostly filled, and
Beverwyck director Douglas R. Miller recounts stories like the
father who now freely communicates with a son in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to bring them into the communication of the
'90s,'' Miller said. ``It's really how their sons and daughters and
grandchildren are communicating, and they're outside of the loop.''
</P>
<P>
   In three years, Webtop has established computer centers in seven
retirement communities statewide, said president and chief
executive Kim Mills, who also has trained schoolchildren, NASA
scientists and Wall Street executives in various computer
applications.
</P>
<P>
   When Mills started Webtop, he surveyed hundreds of senior
citizens, who said ``they'd love to learn how to use this, but were
stuck on where to get started. ... We underestimate what seniors
can do. Seniors tend to have a fear of technology. How to get
started is what trips them up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mills and other trainers have employed some obvious methods to
help older people grow accustomed to the keyboard and monitor. Type
and icons are larger; mouse speed is slowed; keyboards are adjusted
so that characters don't repeat if a key is pressed for too long.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike introductory college courses that concentrate on computer
science, Mills' program reduces operating steps and access to the
Internet to their simplest elements. A training guide, for
instance, shows how to hold and move the mouse and how to master
the ``double-click.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to other Web sites, the company's training site, The
Silver Planet (http://www.silverplanet.net), ``is the simplest of
content,'' Mills said. About 1,000 subscribers pay $14.95 yearly to
access the site, with tips on Web basics and quick access e-mail,
chat rooms and the Yahoo Internet directory.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit San Francisco-based SeniorNet relies on 2,300
volunteer trainers, themselves older adults, to teach computer use
to people age 50 and older at 140 learning centers nationwide, said
Laura Fay, assistant director of development. (Fees range from $20
to $50 for six to eight weeks of classes.)
</P>
<P>
   Having empathetic coaches, in a class with no time or grade
pressure, makes a difference, Fay said. SeniorNet also has learned
that older people lose, rather than gain, patience. Its free Web
site, http://www.seniornet.org, has few graphics, so seniors can
download it quickly. There is a high contrast between background
and text.
</P>
<P>
   Fay believes this older generation has been seeking a way to
become computer literate for some time. ``These are people who are
very engaged in the world around them. They naturally want to learn
this, which is such a part of that world.''
</P>
<P>
   Once past the initial hump of intimidation, seniors can be as
geeky as anyone, Fay said. Also, notably, older people take
advantage of the equal playing field on line. ``The gray hairs
don't show up on line.''
</P>
<P>
   Fay recites an often-repeated comment by one SeniorNet client, a
woman who said, ``When I'm on line, I'm 37, blond and ready to
roll.''

`HILARY AND JACKIE': SISTERS ON A COLLISION COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   English cellist Jacqueline du Pre was one of the great musical
talents of the 20th century. Audiences embraced her bold, inventive
and wholly abandoned playing style, with one critic commenting that
she used the cello to produce ``music that wept.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers will find much more to weep about in ``Hilary and
Jackie,'' the debut film by Anand Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is stirring, moving, loving and teeming with its own
reckless passion.
</P>
<P>
   That passion is comprised of the deep, enduring _ if at times
fragile _ bond between the talented du Pre sisters, Jacqueline
(Emily Watson) and Hilary (Rachel Griffiths), who have such
closeness that they know what the other thinks even after one finds
worldly fame and the other clings to home and hearth in the English
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   As children, Hilary and Jackie are regaled with music and dance
by their creative whirlwind of a mother (a fine Celia Imrie).
</P>
<P>
   At first, Hilary seems to be the musically gifted one and
achieves celebrity as a flutist. But Jackie, who envies Hilary's
talent, ultimately surpasses her by willing herself into becoming a
world-renowned cellist. She marries pianist and conductor Daniel
Barenboim (James Frain), converts to Judaism and lives a life of
jet-setting glamour, traveling and touring to a new city each
night.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary abandons music and opts for a quiet life in the country
with husband Kiffer (Daniel Morrissey) and their children.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Jackie appears at the gate, insatiable for affection
and desperate to renew the tie that has suffered through physical
distance. And Jackie makes a request of her sister that will create
a chasm between them _ until Jackie is confronted with a
cataclysmic tragedy of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Segmented into halves _ Hilary's story and then Jackie's _ the
film essentially covers the same time frame from each sister's
point of view. We're initially horrified by the seemingly spoiled
Jackie, who appears selfish and demanding.
</P>
<P>
   But as we watch her tale unfold, we view a lonely genius who has
no choice in the world but to play music. Without it, she would
wither and perish and she's a sad prisoner to her own life, locked
in emptiness and need and dearly desiring the happy connection to
humanity that Hilary has forged.
</P>
<P>
   Working from an imaginative script by Frank Boyce Cottrell, who
is fast becoming one of Britain's finest screen writers, ``Hilary
and Jackie'' is based upon the book ``A Genius in the Family''
written by Hilary du Pre and her brother, Piers.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting collaboration is an actor's triumph as well as
homage to a difficult, gifted woman.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, who garnered an Oscar nomination for ``Breaking the
Waves,'' has the showier role as Jackie and she makes the most of
the cellist's sad, doomed life. But it's Griffiths, the Australian
actress who was so good in ``Muriel's Wedding,'' who provides the
real heart, soul and spine of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary's gentle, quiet and yes, enabling, devotion to her sister
and family gives Griffiths a chance to strut her stuff as a woman
who doesn't yet know how to say no. By the end, she's a pillar of
strength though she never loses her ability to be tender. It's the
quieter, tougher part, one of heartbreaking vulnerability and
eventual courage, but Griffiths makes Hilary as unforgettable as
Jackie with her vitality and extraordinary gift.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary and Jackie. Directed by Anand Tucker. Written by Frank
Boyce Cottrell. Cast: Emily Watson, Rachel Griffiths, James Frain,

`HI-LO COUNTRY' SUFFERS FROM UNINSPIRED PERFORMANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   British director Stephen Frears' ``The Grifters'' was an example
of neo-noir perfection and its seedy, blood-brown tone accurately
portrayed an American netherworld that lives vibrantly in pulp
fiction and in our imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes it surprising that Frear's ``The Hi-Lo Country''
feels so dull and uninspired.
</P>
<P>
   He manages to bring atmosphere to this revisionist western, but
he can't keep the reins on his actors.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Crudup is a fine performer but he has little to do but
observe as Pete Calder, the quiet narrator of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Harrelson plays Calder's best friend, the outgoing,
passionate Big Boy Matson, but the actor's mugging and hamminess
overwhelm an already on-the-edge character.
</P>
<P>
   The film features some beautiful New Mexico scenery and tries
hard to pay homage to a fading time and a lost way of life that
consists of cattle drives, the open sky and a sense of freedom
beyond compare.
</P>
<P>
   Frears is, perhaps, too genteel a director, though Walon Green's
script _ based on a 1961 novel by Max Evans _ is certainly
problematic and anti-climactic. Evans and the late director Sam
Peckinpah tried to make a film out of the book for two decades,
making one wonder what life Peckinpah could have injected into it.
</P>
<P>
   In the story, Matson returns from World War II to resume life as
a cowboy on the New Mexico/Texas border. But the ways of the west
are changing. Cowboys are fading into legend and progress has made
the lonesome way of life passe. Big ranchers have made a fortune.
Even Big Boy's little brother (Cole Hauser) has even gone off to
work for rich cattleman Jim Ed Love (Sam Elliott).
</P>
<P>
   Pete and Big Boy still share the dream of becoming cattle
ranchers themselves, but they also share love for a married woman,
Mona Birk (Patricia Arquette).
</P>
<P>
   We never know why Big Boy and Pete are friends or what bond
keeps them tied together. Worse, Arquette sleepwalks through the
role as femme fatale Mona. There's no reason either man would be
willing to risk death to be in her company.
</P>
<P>
   The Hi-Lo Country. Directed by Stephen Frears. Written by Walon
Green. Cast: Billy Crudup, Woody Harrelson, Patricia Arquette,
Penelope Cruz. Gramercy Pictures. 125 minutes. Rated R for
language, sexual content, violence.

DON'T LET THE TELETUBBIES DO ALL THE TALKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the words of one grandmother who prefers to remain nameless
in the interest of family harmony, the concern goes something like
this: ``I wondered why my grandson is 19 months old and still
mostly talking gibberish. Then I watched his favorite video,
`Teletubbies,' and I knew why.'' ``Teletubbies,'' a British TV show
for children as young as 12 months, aired for the first time in the
United Stateslast April. It features four animated, alienesque
characters whose tubby-talk is, indeed, not far from gibberish. So
far, though, researchers say there's no reason to think the show
undermines children's ability to develop language unless they are
watching for hours a day, many days a week, and receiving little
verbal stimulation from caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they don't see anything good coming from it,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a facilitative context for learning language, the way
`Sesame Street' is,'' says Karin Lifter, a developmental
psychologist and language specialist at Northeastern University.
``If I had an 18-month-old, I'd prefer him playing with toys.''
</P>
<P>
   Lifter would also prefer children this young not watch any TV or
video. Indeed, language researcher Naomi Baron of American
University says the harm from ``Teletubbies'' may not be from its
language but rather from the residual message children get by being
parked in front of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they become hooked on TV at this young an age, that's
sinful to me,'' Baron says.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Glowacki, a spokeswoman for the National Association
for the Education of Young Children, doesn't like TV any more than
Lifter or Baron, but her son, William, is 2, and he likes
``Teletubbies.'' Luckily, she knows the importance of watching TV
with a child, to mediate and mitigate its messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dance with him when they dance,'' she says. ``Or I talk
about the colors: `Laalaa is yellow, Po is red.' ''
</P>
<P>
   By interacting with William around the images, Glowacki makes
tubby-talk relevant, which is perhaps the only way it can become a
learning tool, according to language researcher Catherine Snow of
the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Language learning occurs when a child is engaged in something
and someone talks to her about it, thus attaching emotional
significance to it. When Laalaa, Po, Tinky Winky, and Dipsy cavort
and giggle in the snow, for instance, the typical 2-year-old viewer
only takes in their upbeat mood. That it's snow, white, and cold
are details that go over her head. But, says Snow, ``If you comment
on it _ `My gosh, they're having fun, aren't they? Look how white
the snow is! I bet it's cold! I can't wait until we have some snow
to play in, too' _ you deepen the level of association. Now they
are attending in a way they weren't before.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's how babies learn to talk:
</P>
<P>
   --Birth to 6 months. With tongues too large to make many sounds,
babies' first noises are limited to the back of the throat and come
out as coos. But coos count: Even though babies do this
instinctively, the more we coo back to them, the more coos they
will produce. ``It starts the notion of back-and-forth
communication and relationship-building,'' Baron says. Some babies
are slower to respond than others. That doesn't mean there's a
problem but, says Baron, ``Parents need to be patient. Give the
baby the time she needs to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   --Six to 9 months: Now you'll begin to hear repeated syllables
that sound intentional but are not yet attempts at communication
except to say, ``Look at the noise I can make!'' ``Mostly they are
trying out new capacities, hearing the sound of their own voice,''
says Snow. She suggests repeating the babble back with variations:
``He says ba-ba, you say ba-ba, ba-ba, and then you throw in a
ga-ga, or change the melody of your voice or the speed at which you
say it.'' Don't expect him to mimic you, Snow cautions, but assume
he's noticing the differences and is intrigued by them.
</P>
<P>
   --10 to 14 months: This is a time of breakthroughs, when the
baby typically speaks her first word and tries to communicate.
``She sees something in the sky and points to it in an effort to
influence you to see it, too,'' says Snow. Gestures like bye-bye
and peekaboo emerge, not because a baby knows what they mean but
because she has figured out a context when they're appropriate.
Seize on the moments when she points or gestures and repeat the
word or name of the action. ``These are teachable moments,'' says
Snow. Even though it may take 20 or 30 repetitions before she takes
a stab at the sound, continue to speak the words. Otherwise, says
Snow, you run the risk of sending a message that her communication
efforts are not important.
</P>
<P>
   --14 months plus: The first word may have taken a year or more
to produce, the second will take a few more weeks, and by the time
a baby is about 18 months, words come so fast you can't keep count.
To facilitate acquisition, Snow recommends predictability in the
way you expose your child to words. For instance, read the same
book over and over rather than introducing a new one each day; that
creates experience and eventual mastery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teletubbies'' may complement this developmental process in two
possible ways. Some of the show's sequences contain a
conversational pattern between mother and teletubby that is similar
to the way we instinctively respond to our babies: in a
high-pitched coo. Even though the TV exchanges are babble,
psychologist Mary Ann Rafoth, a professor at Indiana University of
Pennsylvania, says babies notice them because the intonations and
turn-taking are familiar and comforting. ``There may not be
learning here, but it's reinforcement for the verbal games that go
on at home,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Teletubbies'' also offers lots of repetition: Characters
recite, albeit in tubby-talk, a word the narrator says and some
short segments get replayed as much as three times. This could be
helpful for children who have a developmental delay or who don't
have language stimulation in their lives, according to Lifter.
</P>
<P>
   The more frequently a child hears a word and the more the word
has meaning to his life, the more likely that word will be among
the first he speaks. Baron tells of a child, for instance, whose
first word was ``muh'' to mean ``mine,'' not ``mother.'' ``She'd
been in day care from infancy and that was the word she heard
constantly from other kids in the center,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   While ``uh-oh'' has long been an early word, Snow wouldn't be
surprised if we started hearing more of it from toddlers: It's one
of the most repeated sounds on ``Teletubbies.'' It's not always
used in an appropriate context, however, so Snow suggests
incorporating it into your child's play.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you build a tower,'' she says, ``talk about the first
block, the second block, the red block, the blue block, and when it
gets wobbly and starts to fall, say a big, fat, `Uh-oh!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Not only does that make you incredibly funny, but it means
you're helping your child learn to talk by giving emotional impact
to the word. It's also the best antidote if you worry, like the
concerned grandma, that tubby-talk is only so much gibberish.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Later-born children tend to be slower to talk. Older sibs
monopolize airtime and parents have less time to talk to each
child.
</P>
<P>
   --When a first word is a recognizable sound surrounded by
unrecognizable ones _ ``Mmmmm memem gggg ba-be mmmmm'' _ she may be
speaking a whole sentence. Indeed, her babbling may be
storytelling. Promote it by giving her time alone in the crib:
That's prime time for babies to talk to themselves, an important
step in language development.
</P>
<P>
   --Watching ``Teletubbies'' could produce a temporary dip in the
vocabulary level of a 3-year-old, although anecdotal evidence
suggests 3- and 4-year-olds no longer like the show because they
perceive it as talking down to them.
</P>
<P>
   --Discourage older sibs who do watch from talking tubby-talk
with a toddler. That could be confusing to young children who
frequently learn language patterns and words from siblings. Tell
your preschooler, ``Tubby-talk is fun, but you can be a teacher for
your sister when you use your big-girl words.''
</P>
<P>
   --Some children's early vocabulary consists entirely of nouns _
moon, milk, dog _ while others use words of action: down, up, out.
One approach isn't better than the other, and researchers see no
correlation to subsequent development.
</P>
<P>
   --The TV screen coming to life in the tubbies' tummies can be
confusing to toddlers struggling to understand body functions. Tell
them this is pretend, not the way human bodies work.

`AT FIRST SIGHT' LACKS ALL VISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Irwin Winkler had a great track record as a producer with such
edgy, raw and intelligent movies as ``Raging Bull,'' ``The Right
Stuff'' and ``They Shoot Horses, Don't They?'' He even took home
the Best Picture Oscar for the sleeper smash ``Rocky'' in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere along the line Winkler decided what he really
wanted to do was direct.
</P>
<P>
   After box office duds ``Guilty By Suspicion,'' ``The Net'' and
``Night And The City,'' it's clear Winkler didn't make a brilliant
career move. And ``At First Sight'' is just one more proof.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the story ``To See and Not See'' in Oliver Sacks' book
``An Anthropologist On Mars,'' ``At First Sight'' is a tepid
telling of the meeting and romance between real-life couple Virgil
Adamson (Val Kilmer) and Amy Benic (Mira Sorvino).
</P>
<P>
   Virgil lost his sight as a child and as an adult is blind. He
works as a masseuse in a pricey resort in the small, wintry town
where he grew up, closely watched by his overly protective big
sister, Jennie (Kelly McGillis).
</P>
<P>
   Stressed out architect Amy vacations at the spa and meets Virgil
on the massage table. The result is a lustful love affair and
Virgil moves to New York to be near Amy, a move that creates
friction with Jennie.
</P>
<P>
   Amy's been doing her homework on the sly, learning Dr. Phil
Webster (Nathan Lane in the Robin Williams' role) has been
successful in restoring the sight of blind adults. Virgil undergoes
surgery and regains his sight.
</P>
<P>
   And he learns that the world isn't everything it's cracked up to
be in the imagination. It's a harsh reality check that causes
Virgil to withdraw and reevaluate his life _ even at the cost of
losing Amy.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the film lacks any vision of its own. It's flat,
one-dimensional and barely rises above TV-movie level, though it
boasts the de-natured, dark, brooding look and tone of pretentious
and ``serious'' cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, it's shot in a fashion woefully reminiscent of the 1968
Ralph Nelson film, ``Charly,'' which won a Best Actor Oscar for
Cliff Robertson as a mentally impaired man who undergoes
experimental surgery, becomes a genius, and deteriorates into his
former life at the end.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that a seeing person is more blind than a sightless one
is a common metaphor in the movies, and though ``At First Sight''
purports to explore this theme, it never rises above being a
melodramatic Harlequin romance that hopes to fob itself off as
arty, understated stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But there is so little screen chemistry between Kilmer and
Sorvino that the film really only flickers to life in the scenes
between Kilmer and long-absent-from-the-big-screen Kelly McGillis.
Alas, those moments are far too few.
</P>
<P>
   At First Sight. Directed by Irwin Winkler. Written by Steve
Levitt. Cast: Val Kilmer, Mira Sorvino, Kelly McGillis, Nathan
Lane. MGM. 125 minutes. Rated R for sexual content, language.

`IN DREAMS' IS AN UNITENTIONAL NIGHTMARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The movie year is still young but it seems highly unlikely that
it will be able to produce another film by a major director quite
as agonizingly unpleasant _ and often ludicrous _ as Neil Jordan's
amateurish, long-on-the-shelf, horror film, ``In Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's subject is a psychically gifted Massachusetts housewife
and mother (Annette Bening) plagued by a series of vivid, brutal
nightmares about the serial child killer who is terrorizing her
idyllic rural community.
</P>
<P>
   When her own little girl is kidnapped and murdered, she realizes
her dreams were actually a vision of her own future and she is
somehow in ongoing psychic communication with this Freddy
Krueger-like monster (Robert Downey Jr.).
</P>
<P>
   So the rest of the movie has the grieving mother being fed a
series of dreams by her daughter's murderer _ and engaging in
bizarre, psychic, cat-and-mouse games with him _ while her
long-suffering husband (Aidan Quinn) and the rest of the world
think she's going insane.
</P>
<P>
   The glammed-down Bening tries hard, but _ as radiant a star as
she undeniably is _ she's forced to go through the movie in such a
state of screaming hysteria that she can make nothing very
compelling, or even sympathetic, out of the character. The audience
remains resolutely outside her dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the cast is even more one-dimensional. As her
shrink, Jordan-regular Stephen Rea spends the movie standing around
with a dumb expression on his face. As the killer, Downey _ in
fright-wig and muttering more non-stop inanities than Dustin
Hoffman in ``Rain Man'' _ seems to be playing his part for laughs.
</P>
<P>
   With cheapo-looking production values and bad sound recording,
Jordan is clearly emulating, and no doubt trying to elevate, the
'80s-style splatter horror movie that has recently come back in
vogue. But this film is not half as creepy or competent as even the
worst entry in the ``Friday the 13th'' or ``Nightmare on Elm
Street'' cycles.
</P>
<P>
   In Dreams. Directed by Neil Jordan. Screenplay by Bruce Robinson
and Jordan. Cast: Annette Bening, Robert Downey Jr., Aidan Quinn,
Stephen Rea, Paul Guilfoyle, Katie Sagona. 100 minutes. Rated R for
violence.

`ZOE' IS PRETTY GOOD FOR THE WB, BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a rhythmic symmetry in groupings of four that is
comforting, non-threatening. Think parsley, sage, rosemary and
thyme. John, Paul, George and Ringo.
</P>
<P>
   The cadence is precise, predictable and often preferable to the
jarring dissonance of odd groupings like Winkin', Blinkin' and Nod,
or two guys, a girl and a pizza place. Accordingly, in ``Zoe,
Duncan, Jack &AMP; Jane'' The WB has achieved a nice rhythm and
probably its best comedy to date.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's faint praise. The WB's comedies are more often
tragedies. While ``Zoe, Duncan, Jack &AMP; Jane'' is an improvement
that should gladden hearts at the network, it isn't yet the sort of
appointment television that WB dramas like ``Felicity'' and ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer'' have become.
</P>
<P>
   It is reasonably well cast and well acted, but Sunday's premiere
episode is more about looking smart than being smart. The writing
is clever, but the result is still a collection of punch lines
instead of a funny story.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four characters in this coming-of-age piece based in
Manhattan, Zoe Bean (Selma Blair) is the most appealing. (The show,
in fact, was originally titled ``Zoe Bean.'') She is bright, witty,
honest and pretty. Her best friend, Jane Cooper (Azura Skye), is
all of the above, too, but also a head taller and a good deal more
cynical.
</P>
<P>
   Well-drawn and and wisely chosen, the characters of Zoe and Jane
are easily distinguishable. Not so Duncan and Jack. Duncan Milch
(David Moscow) is Zoe's childhood friend; Jack Cooper (Michael
Rosenbaum) is Jane's twin brother. Duncan is an insecure late
bloomer, Jack an ego in overdrive. Very distinct characters, to be
sure, but it will take more viewings for me to know one from the
other.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the rub. ``Zoe, Duncan, Jack &AMP; Jane'' is pretty good
by The WB's comedic standards, but not quite good enough to ensure
repeat visits. That could change, though, as the writers and
producers invest a little more blood, toil, tears and sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Zoe, Duncan, Jack &AMP; Jane. Half-hour comedy about four teenagers
coming of age in New York City. Premieres Sunday on The WB.
Parental rating: TV-PG.

HOW DO YOU CURE A CLUTTERED CLOSET? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We all get overstuffed during the holidays. But what about our
closets? If you acquired more clothes, squeezed them into your
closet, and shouldered the door closed, it's time to put your
wardrobe on a New Year's diet.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lou Andre believes that clutter is toxic to people's
emotional health, and that getting even one closet back under
control can help relieve that feeling of drowning in stuff.
</P>
<P>
   As owner of Organization by Design, a wardrobe management and
fashion consulting firm in Needham, Mass., Andre has reorganized
almost 500 closets in the seven years she's been in business. Her
tools are not hammers and nails, but swivel-necked hangers, fashion
sense, and the ability to use ``tough love'' on what's in there.
</P>
<P>
   Andre has many tricks for whipping closets into shape (see
sidebar). Foremost is getting rid of not only worn-out clothes, but
those that don't fit, flatter, coordinate, or reflect your
lifestyle. For some people, that covers most everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wear 20 percent of what they own 80 percent of the
time,'' Andre said. ``When you say you want more closet space, look
at the 80 percent you're not wearing and get rid of that. You'll
have plenty of closet room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not telling people to get rid of sentimental things. You
can store them away. Just don't have them taking up prime closet
space. I've seen people who have their wedding dress in their main
closet. And they got married 20 years ago!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Englanders have especially acute closet problems because our
typically older homes were not built to accommodate
late-20th-century materialism.
</P>
<P>
   Though Andre's dream closet would be a California-style walk-in
with soft lighting and compartments galore, her older home in
Needham has the same relatively small reach-in closets that vex
most of us. ``I have,'' she said, ``made extreme use of my closet
space.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre uses three upstairs closets for herself: one for business
clothes, one for casual outfits, and one for storing out-of-season
items. One downstairs closet is devoted to coats, another to her
husband's things. ``Separate closets is a good idea. Then that's
one battle you don't have to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   A special kind of awe is inspired when utilitarian things are
treated with great respect: the vegetable patch tended as carefully
as the flower garden, the garage kept as clean as the car.
</P>
<P>
   Lovely though her living room is, it's Mary Lou Andre's closets
that you remember. And not just because they're neat. You actually
get the sense that each outfit is working so hard to keep its place
on the rack that you wonder if all those well-cut, elegant suits do
push-ups after the closet doors are shut.
</P>
<P>
   What's missing is not just clutter, but those odd shirts and
vests that loiter in most closets, like wallflowers at a singles
bar, hoping for a match.
</P>
<P>
   Andre's 5-foot-long work closet contains 27 completely
accessorized outfits _ pressed, hung, and waiting to go.
Twenty-five are pantsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In Andre's Darwinian closet, skirts just don't pay their way
anymore. ``I've been out of skirts for five years. People have
gotten very, very busy. And you need the right shoes and right hose
to carry off a skirt. I have business clients like lawyers who say
they have to wear skirts, but when I get them a pantsuit to try,
they want more. Pants are easier and more comfortable. There's a
reason men wear them!''
</P>
<P>
   All Andre's pantsuits and shoes are in dark, neutral tones,
mostly black and brown. She invests a large portion of her shopping
dollar in blouses that provide a punch of color and variety. ``I
think of tops as accessories.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything is well-displayed, with the components of each
outfit, including scarfs or jewelry, hung together, so she can see
what she has at a glance. Each night she hangs the next day's
outfit on a hook on the back of the door to let wrinkles hang out,
though it's hard to imagine there are any.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D-day for Andre is Memorial Day, when she switches her winter
and warm-weather clothes. She does the opposite around Labor Day.
During these biannual inventory periods, she decides what she needs
to replace.
</P>
<P>
   Then she takes worn or out-of-style clothes downtown to Morgan
Memorial, gets a receipt, and estimates a value for each
contribution using a formula a CPA devised for her (available from
her company in the $18 booklet ``Cash for Your Used Clothing'').
Last year, when she and her husband moved, Andre claimed a $2,000
deduction for her giveaways. ``If I weren't going by the book, I'd
have probably guessed $500.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre says her clients often seem to need her to give them
permission to discard old clothes; after all, in New England we're
taught clothing lasts forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suits are usually dead after three to five years. They get
worn and styles get dated,'' said Andre, pulling out a brown
pantsuit and appraising it with satisfaction. ``I've worn this for
five years. It owes me nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Her closets are filled with practical features: good lighting,
uniform swivel-necked hangers (like those in department stores),
see-through storage containers, hooks, and mirrors. She makes
frequent use of a folding clothes rack ($60 at Organization by
Design) for parties, packing, and sorting or airing clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Whimsical touches abound. She had Sam Simon of Brushworks in
Newton paint gold and avocado stripes and other warm colors ``to
make the clothes look richer.'' Then she glued decorative buttons
to the ceilings and some of the walls. A ceramic hand on top of a
Bombay Co. jewelry cabinet has pearl necklaces snaked through its
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Andre's most expensive clothing purchase, a gold Chanel jacket,
is displayed on a mannequin _ just another example of how she
really works her wardrobe. She can't wear her designer jacket every
day, so rather than hiding it in a closet, she's turned it into a
sculpture and made it part of the decor.
</P>
<P>
   Andre, 34, started her career by going through friends' closets
just for fun, displaying her talent for pulling together new
ensembles from unrelated pieces. She calls this ``shopping in your
closet.''
</P>
<P>
   She became adept at sweetly asking, ``Do you really want this?''
without seeming to question the owner's sanity or taste.
</P>
<P>
   After her friends had been ``Mary Lou'ed,'' she started
Organization by Design. ``The timing was good because after the
'80s, people really wanted to pare down.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre turned out to be a natural entrepreneur. She started a
subscription newsletter (``Dressing Well'') and eventually a Web
site (dressingwell.com).
</P>
<P>
   Though business was slow at first, Andre kept reinvesting in it
and eventually was able to move her office out of her home, hire a
staff, and raise her rates from next to nothing to $150 an hour.
Then she trained a $100-an-hour associate, June Tarter, who now
works with most of the private clients so Andre can concentrate on
corporate and retail seminars.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Mary Lou Andre do to unwind? You guessed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm exhausted, sometimes I'll come home and play in my
closet, putting together new combinations, straightening up,
thinking about what I need to add. It's a hobby to me. It's the one
area of my life where it's completely organized, where I have total
control.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS TO UNCLUTTER YOUR CLOSET &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Want to unclutter your clothes closet? Here are 10 tips from
Mary Lou Andre of Organization by Design, in Needham, Mass.:
</P>
<P>
   --If your closet is dark, install bright lighting so you can
really see what you have.
</P>
<P>
   --Use sturdy department store-style swivel hangers, not wire or
padded ones. When you buy new clothes, ask to keep the store
hangers.
</P>
<P>
   --Get rid of items of clothing that haven't been worn in a year
(unless they're classic evening wear or sentimental favorites).
Ditto for items permanently stained or torn beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   --Assemble complete outfits, including accessories, on one
hanger.
</P>
<P>
   --Separate your professional, casual, and special occasion
clothes (into different closets, if you have them). Hang your
formal clothes in a zippered garment bag in the back of your
closet. Store dressy shoes, evening bags, and accessories together
in a clear shoe box.
</P>
<P>
   --Think of blouses and shirts as accessories and line them up on
one side of the closet to free up space underneath for storage. To
save time, send cotton shirts to the dry cleaners to be laundered
and ironed.
</P>
<P>
   --Install hooks to hang necklaces, belts, and pocketbooks. Buy a
compartmentalized jewelry cabinet for fine jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   --Keep scarves folded in a basket on a shelf for easy access or
hang scarfs with the outfits you wear them with.
</P>
<P>
   --Have separate drawers for workout clothes, costume jewelry,
undergarments, pants, and hose and socks.
</P>
<P>
   --Move out-of-season clothes into a storage closet or bin.
Choose a date each spring and fall to switch your seasonal
wardrobes. Assess whether you need to keep, discard, clean, or
repair each piece at those times.

   I &UR;  &LR; saw my friend Christina on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   She walked into church with a new hairdo, her smile as radiant
as ever, but there were dark smudges below her eyes, which hadn't
been there a week earlier. There was a slight swelling in her
abdomen where fluid was collecting as her cancer advanced. I hugged
her slim frame, embarrassed at how glad I was to see her.
</P>
<P>
   I've known Christina for years, yet I never dreamed I'd care so
much about her. Even though our paths often crossed, she was so
very attractive, so cool and self-reliant that I couldn't imagine
our becoming friends. Others, too, saw her as distant and
standoffish. It was a trait Christina had deliberately cultivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life,'' she said, ``I've been afraid of intimacy. I've
defended myself against rejection and abandonment by being strong
and capable. So what's the only thing I fear more than being weak
and in need?'' She answered herself. ``Cancer. I suspect cancer was
the only teacher powerful enough to open me up so that I could
allow other people in.''
</P>
<P>
   Christina's illness has brought her beginner's mind. She's ready
to entertain once-forbidden thoughts, to reexamine the choices
she's made in life. How many of us, aware our death is very close,
will be willing to do the hard work of trying to reach a higher
level of consciousness? How many will be willing to share the
insights we reach?
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction to ``The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying,''
the Dalai Lama wrote, ``Death is a natural part of life which we
will all surely have to face sooner or later. To my mind there are
two ways we can deal with it while we are alive. We can either
choose to ignore it or we can confront the prospect of our own
death and, by thinking clearly about it, try to minimize the
suffering that it can bring. . . . (To achieve) a peaceful death,
we must cultivate peace in our mind.'' Christina is the only person
I know who seems instinctively to understand how much
soul-searching dying demands from the living.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cancer has shed so much light onto all the aspects of my
life,'' she muses. ``Somewhere in my childhood I decided not to
trust, to do it all on my own even though it leaves you absolutely
exhausted. I played that isolated role in my business, with people,
and also with my body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time the cancer reoccurred, I repeated the pattern. I
was like a mother trying to save a suicidal child. I felt
overwhelmed by that responsibility and as a result, my body and I
were both feeling pushed around,'' Christina tells me. ``But this
morning _ I was crying _ I finally said to my body, `I can't do
this alone anymore. You have to tell me what you want. You need to
let me know.' And suddenly I thought, `What a ridiculous thing. Why
am I turning us into opposing forces?' All my life I've been in the
role of caretaker, the only one who knows what's good and right,
but I've reached the point of no return. Something in me said, `No
more of this suffering. Get off it. Move on.' It was my choice to
create this kind of relationship. Now I'm done. That part of my
life is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to be the dominant partner anymore, or my body's
hostage, either.'' Christina's eyes are fierce. ``It's time to
accept my body as an equal partner and to bring about an
integration of my mind and my body, my soul and my spirit. I've
always been dedicated to learning and growth, but now for the first
time I understand that my body is also equally dedicated to that
cause, only in its own way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing the unity of life for the first time,'' Christina
says softly. ``The other _ whatever it is I made the other _ is
truly a very beautiful and dedicated being. Dedicated to the same
cause. We're all intertwined and we all mean well. We've been
having such poor communication, but now I can say, `If you feel you
need to kill this body, then go do it.' '' She smiles, crinkling
the corners of her eyes. ``If there's only till death do us part,
let's at least have some fun.'' After Christmas, she planned a
visit to the hospital to have the fluid drained from her stomach so
that she and her family could spend New Year's Eve in the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of every Christmas Eve service in our church, each
person holds a candle aloft in the darkened sanctuary as we sing
the word ``Shalom'' to the tune of ``Silent Night.'' I glanced over
at Christina. In the candle's flame, her face seemed to glow with
some miraculous inner light. I thanked God for giving us another
glorious night together on this planet. I thought of something
Christina had said to me earlier: ``I may have cancer, but the
cancer doesn't have me.''
</P>
<P>
   Blessed be. It is still true.

A PRESENT THAT ALL HANDYPERSONS CAN ENJOY ALL YEAR LONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The handyman gets a fair amount of mail each week, including
letters from budding handypersons or homeowners desperate for an
answer to their questions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these letters are promptly (most of the time)
answered, because the handyman does answer his mail.
</P>
<P>
   He gets even more mail from manufacturers, inventors, and
designers asking for a little free publicity. ``Write about my
wonderful product,'' these people ask, or ``Say something nice
about my invention.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes those products and/or inventions are indeed worth
writing about, so the handyman gets a story, and the inventor or
manufacturer gets his free ad. That is how the system works.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely does the handyman get a Christmas gift, which is good,
because he is supposed to return any gifts if he can't eat it or
drink it in one sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, we got one gift from a reader who signed simply RJL,
12/25/98. We couldn't eat it or drink it, because it was RJL's plan
for a simple table, made from two sheets of plywood and a few saw
cuts. ``For your handyman column,'' wrote RJL.
</P>
<P>
   And so it will be, with a bit of elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   RJL's plan is simple, using two sheets of 4- by 8-foot plywood
three-quarters of an inch thick, properly illustrated:
</P>
<P>
   One 4 x 8 x 3/4 makes top.
</P>
<P>
   One 2 x 8 x 3/4 makes long leg.
</P>
<P>
   Two 2 x 4 x 3/4 make two short legs.
</P>
<P>
   Four notches 3/4 inch by 1 foot hold the legs upright and
steady. One notch is cut in the middle of each 2 x 4, and two
notches cut in the 2 x 8 two feet from each end.
</P>
<P>
   Insert the long leg into the two short ones to form a double
crossing; it's a little like putting together the grid of an
old-fashioned egg crate, or a cardboard box designed to hold
Christmas ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   The 4 x 8 sheet goes on top of the legs. Screw it down with
two-inch-long solid brass screws.
</P>
<P>
   RJL did not suggest what to use the table for, except that it is
for ``many uses.'' He added that it is quick to assemble and easy
to take it apart for storage.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman will add his two cents worth as to uses: One
heckuva big coffee table. A train table. In a pinch, throw a
mattress on it for a temporary bed.
</P>
<P>
   Get more uses out of it by making higher legs, bringing it up to
standard table height (about 30 inches): a big dining table, a
little like a harvest table, good for lots of diners, at least 12.
A sewing table.
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea; there are any mumber of uses not even dreamed
of.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a permanent place for such a table, you can glue all
pieces together with white or yellow carpenter's glue. For outdoor
uses, use resorcinol glue, one that comes in two parts, holds like
crazy, and is waterproof.
</P>
<P>
   And, you can make your table any size to fit whatever uses you
have in mind for it.
</P>
<P>
   Some more ideas: If you use just plain plywood, you will have a
pretty rough table. So, one thing to make it a little less rough is
to buy plywood ``good on one side,'' or ``good on both sides,'' or
even better, birch ply on each side.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of sides, you have to consider the edges as well.
Plywood edges are rough, and can snag on clothes and scratch
careless handlers. These rough edges also tend to develop
splinters.
</P>
<P>
   So, cover the edges. There are many types of edging, but easiest
and least expensive is to fill the edges with wood filler, smooth
off, and sand. While easy and inexpensive, this method still leaves
a sharp edge that cannot be rounded off.
</P>
<P>
   Or, install a veneer strip; they come self-adhesive or can be
applied with glue or contact cement.
</P>
<P>
   Or, nail half-inch parting bead (a molding three-quarters of an
inch wide, to the edge. Chamfer the edges by rounding them a bit
with a plane. In fact, there are several types of wood edging you
can buy.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are plastic T-strips that fit in a groove cut into
the plywood edging.
</P>
<P>
   And, finish?
</P>
<P>
   There are many choices, but paint is the easiest, especially if
you do not use a birch plywood. After treating the edges, apply one
coat of latex enamel undercoater (also called undercoat and
primer-sealer), then finish with one or two coats of latex eggshell
finish latex wall paint or a semigloss or satin latex enamel. As
always, thin coats are better than thick ones.
</P>
<P>
   Fir plywood does not take stain or varnish very well (the grain
is too distinct and contrasty), but birch and other hardwood
veneers do. Apply an oil stain and finish with two coats of a
semigloss, oil-based, polyurethane varnish.
</P>
<P>
   Color? The handyman never suggests color in either stain or
paint. Too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lovely Christmas present, RJL.

A COUPLE OF HIGH-FIVES BETWEEN CRITICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS and GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Of all the movies coming up, the following five
could really be something. No guarantees, though; last year at this
time, I thought ``The Thin Red Line'' would, at least, keep me
awake.
</P>
<P>
   Anywhere but Here: Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman sound
perfectly cast as the dysfunctional mother and daughter from Mona
Simpson's brilliantly observed novel. And director Wayne Wang made
one of the best parent/child movies of all time, ``The Joy Luck
Club.'' (April)
</P>
<P>
   Cradle Will Rock: The story behind Orson Welles' almost aborted
staging of a controversial play in 1930s New York. Tim Robbins
directs an immensely cool cast that includes Joan and John Cusack,
Vanessa Redgrave, John Turturro and Emily Watson, all playing
famous (and infamous) cultural figures of the era. (Fall)
</P>
<P>
   The Fight Club: If Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are ever going to
redeem themselves for ``Meet Joe Black'' and ``American History
X,'' respectively, it will be in this surreal, gritty thriller by
the director of ``Seven,'' David Fincher. (Summer)
</P>
<P>
   Magnolia: Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson, the Valley's own
cinematic bard, returns with another sprawling, multicharacter
study of the tough and tender side of San Fernando Valley living.
Hopefully as bold and insightful but perhaps less pornographic than
Anderson's scintillating ``Boogie Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer of Sam: Spike Lee is at his best when depicting hot and
bothered New York summers, so maybe this reality-based look at a
'70s neighborhood haunted by a serial killer will recapture his
glorious work of ``Do the Right Thing.'' (Summer) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER VIEW: Blindly groping my way through a list of 200
movies, here are five that I'd actually pay money to see. (Not that
I'll have to.) I didn't include the ``Star Wars'' prequel because
the Force is strong enough without my plug.
</P>
<P>
   All the Pretty Horses: Again, I go for pedigree. Great book
(Cormac McCarthy), accomplished director (Billy Bob Thornton) and a
genre I can't get enough of (western). Matt Damon isn't Clint
Eastwood, but he is a good bit of casting as John Grady Cole, the
hero of McCarthy's border trilogy. (Holidays)
</P>
<P>
   Bringing Out the Dead: Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul
Schrader gave us ``Taxi Driver,'' ``Raging Bull'' and ``The Last
Temptation of Christ.'' Here they team with Nicolas Cage _ always
best when playing a loose cannon _ for a tale of a New York
paramedic on the edge. Look for creative sparks to fly. (Autumn)
</P>
<P>
   Man on the Moon: Jim Carrey channels Andy Kaufman. And Milos
Forman directs. Enough said. (Autumn)
</P>
<P>
   The Muse: Sharon Stone has a wonderful sense of humor _ it's
just never been utilized before in a decent movie. Who better to
let the cat out of the bag than Albert Brooks? With an outstanding
supporting cast and a host of cameos, this satire about Hollywood
shapes up as one of the year's smartest comedies. (June 4)
</P>
<P>
   Wild Wild West: Director Barry Sonnenfeld's take on the classic
TV show will be the year's best Bond film. If the world needs
saving, I'd take special agent Will Smith over Pierce Brosnan in a
heartbeat. Add Kevin Kline as the sidekick and Salma Hayek as the
requisite babe and you've got the makings of a deliciously wry
franchise. (July 2) &QL;

KILMER DELIVERS IN `AT FIRST SIGHT'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
Our rating: 2 { Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; You can understand why Virgil, the empathetic
blind masseur, and Amy, a harried New York architect, would fall
for each other in ``At First Sight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Virgil,'' says Amy, ``touches you, not for sex, but to get to
know you better. And he really listens!'' Add to that the fact that
Virgil is played by Val Kilmer, and you have every woman's dream of
a sensitive hunk.
</P>
<P>
   As for Amy, Virgil tells his adorable guide dog that she
``smells like cinnamon and nutmeg and has skin smooth like
butter.'' Besides sounding like she'd make a great pancake topping,
Amy has other attributes, most notably Mira Sorvino's shapely legs.
</P>
<P>
   Add all this together and include plenty of earnest dialogue and
numerous shots of Kilmer shirtless and you have a recipe for some
half-baked hokum. ``At First Sight,'' though, manages to make for
some fairly decent entertainment thanks in large part to a skillful
performance by Kilmer, who gives his character an appealing
innocence that never lapses into self-pitying caricature.
</P>
<P>
   Like the 1990 medical drama ``Awakenings,'' ``At First Sight''
is based on a true story from medical miracle worker Dr. Oliver
Sacks. But this movie isn't so much about science as it is the
human heart, which can be treacherous territory for even the most
gifted filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Kilmer's Virgil is a masseur at a small upstate New York ski
resort. He's happily contented with his life, which is made all the
more pleasant and simple thanks to the help of his overprotective
older sister, Jennie (Kelly McGillis). Then Virgil meets Amy, an
overworked architect in desperate need of human kindness, not to
mention a good back rub. Sparks are kindled and soon Virgil is
packing his bags and heading to New York, much to Jennie's
consternation.
</P>
<P>
   There in the Big Apple (filmed with considerably more grit than
Nora Ephron gave us in ``You've Got Mail''), Virgil deals with city
noise and learns about an experimental surgery that restores sight
to people blind since birth. Amy pushes it, Virgil relents and soon
enough, the doctors are removing the bandages and Virgil finds he
has recovered his vision.
</P>
<P>
   That's not necessarily good news. Virgil's eyes can see, but his
brain can't decipher the images transmitted to it. Other problems:
He can't judge distances or shapes. He can't understand why Amy is
kissing her ex-husband at a party. He can't figure out the way
people dance to the Village People's ``YMCA.'' Basically, he can't
trust his eyes. And as Virgil learns life all over again, he is
sapped of the sensitive qualities that made him a special person.
His relationship with Amy suffers, too.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Levitt's screenplay effectively conveys the challenges
facing Virgil in his new world as well as the shifting sands of his
love affair with Amy. But the movie often settles for obvious
metaphors and a scientific shorthand that serve the plot but reduce
the events' significance. The medical community and their methods
are given particularly short shrift, which is ironic given Sacks'
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the long-absent McGillis, the supporting cast
includes an oily Steven Weber as Amy's insensitive ex-husband and
Nathan Lane playing a wise-cracking therapist for the blind.
Mostly, though, this is a showcase for Kilmer and Sorvino. Kilmer
more than holds up his end; Sorvino, meanwhile, shows off her
penchant for ardent solemnity a little too much for her own (and
the movie's) good. But she does have that dairylike skin, an
attribute the filmmakers milk for all it's worth. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ ``Varsity Blues'' pretends it's a sociological
study about high school football in small-town Texas and the
pseudo-religious fervor it generates. But it's really an example of
demographics-addled Hollywood trying to pack a movie with
everything show-biz types think teen-agers want to see.
</P>
<P>
   There's hot young TV actor of the moment James Van Der Beek as a
book-reading second-string quarterback named Mox, who's basically a
beefed-up variation on his cuddlesome ``Dawson's Creek''
intellectual.
</P>
<P>
   There's an insanely sexist emphasis on getting every attractive
female in the movie out of her clothing; the lucky ones get to wear
strategic dollops of whipped cream. Only Mox's level-headed
girlfriend Jules remains clothed. But she is nevertheless played by
a model (Amy Smart).
</P>
<P>
   There's endless partying and general, if mild, contempt for
authority figures, mostly pathetic parental units whose lives
revolve vicariously around their sons' athletic accomplishments.
There's actual rebellion, eventually, against the hissable,
winning-is-everything coach (Jon Voight).
</P>
<P>
   But even rebels can win the big game.
</P>
<P>
   As the cliches fly faster than the pigskins (which is pretty
fast; one of ``Varsity's'' best elements is its copious game
footage, shot by ``Waterboy'' and ``Jerry Maguire'' pro Charles
Cohen), the young actors give it the old school try. The ones who
aren't models, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Though still playing it as sensitive and decent as the game
night is long, the newly dark-haired Van Der Beek tosses in a
self-confident swagger that's a nice change from Dawson's dithering
insecurity. He also has an interesting issue _ Mox is more
concerned about an Ivy League education than high school sports,
but when he takes over the team after an injury sidelines the star
quarterback, he genuinely has to wrestle with the sudden rushes of
adulation and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Walker brings a dignified angst to that fallen super
athlete, whose supreme status and bright future are wiped out in a
second. There's also a big fat lineman, whom Ron Lester plays
mostly as a loud, ravenous, good ol' boor, but also occasionally as
a lost little boy who can't find his way through a world that's too
big even for him. Scott Caan has fun as the squad's most
incorrigible hell-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   However hard the kids work, though, they rarely transcend the
simple stereotypes of W. Peter Iliff's screenplay. For his part,
Voight plays the maniacal coach like a Southern-fried Mussolini,
complete with stiff-armed pep rally salute.
</P>
<P>
   The actors got little apparent guidance from director Brian
Robbins, a former TV teen himself (``Head of the Class''), and
co-creator of such Nickelodeon kid shows as ``Kenan &AMP; Kel'' and
``All That.'' Reports that he's turned ``Varsity Blues'' into
``Porky's''-with-pads overstate the case; it's not all raunchy,
superficial adolescent pandering.
</P>
<P>
   But it is so much that that whatever serious intentions the
filmmakers might have had are drowned out by all the pumped-up,
rah-rah sensationalism. &QL;

MURKY EXCESSES HURT `DREAMS'

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Having your mind invaded by a malevolent
consciousness is a natural for fright flicks. It involves losing
control, going mad, seeing things ... all those primal fears.
</P>
<P>
   It's why the ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' movies seemed to go on
forever. And also why it often felt like forever watching them.
While mental takeover may be a great, scary subject, it's also an
invitation to incoherence. With so much of a film taking place in
surreal, subjective dream worlds, directors tend to fill them with
any old image that strikes their fancy.
</P>
<P>
   With ``In Dreams,'' Neil Jordan is the latest filmmaker to
embrace that syndrome. He's also one of the best; when at peak
performance, as he was with ``The Crying Game,'' ``Michael
Collins'' and last year's exquisitely demented ``The Butcher Boy,''
the Irish director weds brilliant imagery with unforgettable
storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Dreams'' has a vast supply of great pictures, but they hurt
as much as help the film's murky, slip-sliding narrative. Based on
Bari Wood's novel ``Doll's Eyes'' and re-scripted by Jordan from a
screenplay by Bruce Robinson (``The Killing Fields''), the movie is
rich with frightening premonitions and lyrical underwater sequences
(a small town was built, then flooded, in the same Baja water tanks
where James Cameron shot ``Titanic'').
</P>
<P>
   It all sets an agreeably creepy mood, and even when things get
brutal and bloody, the visuals are at least as attractive as they
are repulsive, thanks a great deal to ``Seven'' cinematographer
Darius Khondji. But they also keep the story anchored to a level of
confused hooey.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Bening plays New England book illustrator Claire Cooper.
Slightly psychic all her life, she's plagued by incomprehensible
visions of a child killer just as little girls in her leafy, rural
community start turning up in the reservoir where that town used to
be. When her own daughter goes missing, Claire's mental state
naturally deteriorates.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's what her slightly straying husband (Aidan
Quinn) and clueless psychiatrist (Stephen Rea) think. They just
don't understand that there's a long-haired, squeaky-voiced,
sometimes cross-dressing psycho-killer mama's boy messing around
inside her skull and _ even more alarming _ he's played by Robert
Downey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Most viewers will share hubby and Doc's point of view: What
actually is going on here is pretty hard to understand. We're in
Claire's dreams one moment, then the killer's past, or perhaps an
asylum where the policies apparently haven't been updated since the
days of Bedlam. We're in the 1960s, underwater, in a computer,
surrounded by apples ... sometimes all in the same scene. Some of
this feels like it makes sense, but usually there's precious little
solid evidence of that.
</P>
<P>
   Besides how great everything looks, the movie is worth seeing
for Bening, an actress who has always seemed to be capable of much
more than she's normally asked to do. Bening really gets a chance
to let it rip here, though, as Claire is pushed to the outer edges
of stress and sanity, then forced to call up all the seductiveness
she can muster when finally confronting her tormentor in the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan may not have been certain about what he was doing with
``In Dreams.'' But Annette Bening sure was. &QL;

UNSPOOLING ART OF CINEMATOGRAPHY
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In cinematographer Vittorio Storaro's hands, light
and color become emotion. The sweeping epics ``Apocalypse Now,''
``The Last Emperor,'' ``Reds'' and ``Last Tango in Paris''
exemplify his ability to let visual surroundings tell the story in
an unspoken way.
</P>
<P>
   As for Storaro's skill with color, think back to ``Dick Tracy.''
The hues in this stylish adaptation of the comic strip were every
bit as bright as the movie posters in the theater lobby, which is
no common feat. Nor is it a coincidence that Storaro is a
three-time Academy Award winner, having collected Oscars for
``Apocalypse Now'' (1979), ``Reds'' (1981) and ``The Last Emperor''
(1987).
</P>
<P>
   The film series ``Writing and Light: The Cinematography of
Vittorio Storaro,'' getting under way at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art, illustrates the achievements of a cinematic career
that spans 30 years and 40 films _ and continues today.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30 tonight, ``The Conformist'' (1969) and ``Last Tango in
Paris'' (1972) will be paired. Both are collaborations of Storaro
and Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci. At 7:30 p.m. Saturday,
director Warren Beatty stars in ``Reds'' with Diane Keaton and Jack
Nicholson in the epic film biography of left-wing journalist John
Reed.
</P>
<P>
   The three-weekend series continues Jan. 22 with rare 70mm
screenings of two Francis Ford Coppola features, ``Apocalypse Now''
and ``One From the Heart.'' On Jan. 29, ``Dick Tracy'' and ``The
Sheltering Sky'' from 1990 will be paired. Storaro is scheduled to
attend the final event, a 7:30 p.m. screening of ``Tango,'' a
current release from Spain and that country's entry in the 1998
Oscar category for foreign-language films.
</P>

 &HT;    INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS FIND ``IRREGULARITIES'' IN CHINA LOCAL
VOTING
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 450 words.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Election observers from The Carter Center in Atlanta
broke Thursday from their previous upbeat assessments of local
elections in China, issuing a largely negative report on balloting
they found riddled with ``irregularities in almost all stages.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the drawbacks, observers applauded the enthusiasm of
Chinese voters. And at least some were perplexed that China has
maintained this sliver of openness when it is in the midst of a
crackdown on pro-democracy activists in the big cities.
</P>
<P>
   These local elections ``fell significantly short'' of all the
benchmarks of democracy, which include offering voters a genuine
choice, a transparent nomination process, a secret ballot, and a
public vote count, the team said in a statement released after a
six-day visit to the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Three earlier Carter Center reports on village elections carried
a more positive tone, although they also listed some deficiencies
in the Communist Party's decade-long effort in China to bring a
semblance of democratic processes to the very lowest grassroots
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make one important distinction. This is the first
time The Carter Center has seen township-level elections,'' said
Charles Costello, the new director of the center's Democracy
Program.
</P>
<P>
   The elections the observers followed were for township
government representatives from villages around the central China
city of Chongqing. They lacked many of the basic democratic
elements that had been present in earlier elections, the team
found.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier teams observed elections for village leaders, which
have a distinct set of regulations mandating many of the processes
the Carter Center viewed as central to democratic elections,
including individual voting booths and secret ballots.
</P>
<P>
   These latest elections were for delegates to the township
people's congresses. These congresses are the first step in a
pyramid that eventually results in the National People's Congress,
China's highest legislative body, and are governed by regulations
that do not even stipulate secret ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The observers' report said one positive element is the
willingness of the Chinese to let international observers watch the
elections and proffer recommendations for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite a paradox, between having a crackdown on a small
handful of democratic activists, and then pushing these local
grassroots elections,'' said Merle Goldman, history professor at
Boston University and a scholar of political reform in China. She
referred to the arrests and stiff sentences handed out in the past
two months to a group of Chinese who tried to start a new China
Democracy Party, a crackdown that has elicited international
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that they think they can handle the peasants in
the countryside much more easily than they can handle a small group
of democratic activists,'' she said of China's top leaders. ``I
think they may rue the day they allowed this to happen. Once this
(election) process gets underway, it is going to be very difficult
to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pastor, the Emory University political science professor
who started The Carter Center's China program on village elections
in 1996, said the observer team raised the crackdown during talks
with China's top-level communist leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In response, some Chinese officials said the activists were
arrested for trying to subvert the government and overthrow the
Communist Party. Others recited a list of worries mostly related to
China's economic slowdown -- from layoffs and labor unrest to an
unhealthy banking system -- and to the fact that the upstart party
was able to organize across the nation so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously these things are making the regime nervous, and
that's why they cracked down,'' Pastor said.

 &HT;    Creepy `Dreams' survives slip-up
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``In Dreams'' is at its best in its first hour or so. That's
when director Neil Jordan (``The Crying Game'' and ``The Butcher
Boy,'' arguably 1998's best film) cannily sets up this eerie,
unsettling tale of a psychic woman being harassed in her dreams by
a child-murdering psychopath.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan begins with shots of divers snaking through an entire
underwater town. We're told that the place met its watery grave
more than 30 years ago when it was flooded to make room for a
reservoir. Now, like some lesser Titanic, the village has been
preserved for eternity, its church graveyard as fully entombed as
its soda fountain. But these divers aren't looking for relics;
they're searching for the body of a missing child.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, in a picture-perfect house nestled in a picture-perfect
New England autumn, lives Claire Cooper (Annette Bening). Claire's
life would indeed be picture perfect except for one thing: She
keeps having visions of this child murderer. Unfortunately, her
dreams are more teasing than revelatory; she never sees the
killer's face, just memorable bits and pieces.
</P>
<P>
   No one believes Claire. Not her airline pilot husband (Aidan
Quinn). Not the local sheriff (Paul Guilfoyle). And not her shrink
(Stephen Rea).
</P>
<P>
   For a good long time, ``In Dreams'' is a gripping genre film, a
kind of adult spin on the ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' series and
the old Faye Dunaway thriller ``The Eyes of Laura Mars.'' When he
wants, Jordan can deliver more chills than similar serial-killer
flicks like ``Seven'' or ``Kiss the Girls''; he's especially adept
at preying on those of us susceptible to children or animals in
danger.
</P>
<P>
   But about two-thirds of the way through, the picture takes an
ill-advised turn into an overly long encounter between Claire and
the madman of her dreams (Robert Downey Jr.). The film has been so
effective up to that point that we stay with it as best we can, but
it's like watching an automobile accident in slow motion. Jordan
doesn't totally lose control, but he goes into a very long skid.
And the damage, though somewhat repairable, is never erased.
</P>
<P>
   Kudos must go to Bening, who sustains a difficult, demanding
role with authority. And Jordan certainly makes every image count,
whether it's a school pageant or a corpse being lifted Ophelia-like
from the water.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, ``In Dreams'' feels like an internal journey (is
Claire truly psychic, insane or both?), one that has been
externalized to make it more accessible (i.e., commercial). If
you're fond of suspense thrillers with weird vibes, you won't feel
as if you've wasted your time. But if you're fond of Jordan, you'll
wonder when he let the movie get away from him _ and what he might
have done to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Dreams''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Annette Bening. Directed by Neil Jordan. Rated R for
violence and disturbing themes. 1 hour, 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Could give you nightmares, even if it's not an
altogether successful effort.

 &HT;    Noteworthy tale of sibling rivalry
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title ``Hilary and Jackie'' suggests an A&AMP;E special on first
ladies with cheating husbands.
</P>
<P>
   This real-life psychological drama, however, is actually a tale
of two musical sisters. One soars professionally; the other
doesn't. Yet each suffers in her own particular way.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the best-selling memoir ``A Genius in the Family,'' the
movie focuses on the complex relationship between Jacqueline du Pre
(Emily Watson), a world-famous cellist who died of multiple
sclerosis in 1987 at age 42, and her sister, Hilary (Rachel
Griffiths). A skilled flutist, Hilary lacked Jackie's prodigious
talent and opted instead for married life on a farm in rural
England. Or, as Jackie says in the movie _ and it's not meant
kindly _ ``She used to be a musician, but now it's all chickens and
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie attempts something daring in that, ``Rashomon''-style,
it tells the same sequence of events as each sister experienced it.
As you might expect, their stories don't match. But it's Jackie
who's shortchanged. Hilary's version is shown in considerable
depth, but Jackie's feels sketched in and rushed.
</P>
<P>
   While it's probably true that Jackie was an artist/monster who
devoured anyone who came near, we don't get enough sense of how she
got that way, how neediness, vulnerability and talent became a kind
of sick greed. The movie's dual vision is best when it provides an
insightful contrast between what is assumed and what is real. For
instance, when Jackie first becomes famous, we see Hilary and her
parents all agog at her sudden celebrity. In Jackie's story we see
how her supposedly glamorous globetrotting was, in her own eyes, a
torturous succession of airports and hotel rooms, with only a cello
for company.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, director Anand Tucker and screenwriter Frank
Cottrell Boyce don't always fill in the blanks that well. Neither
can Watson, though her naked intensity transforms the simple act of
straddling a cello into a kind of Dionysian ecstasy. And while

 &HT;    `Hurlyburly' all wound up but with nowhere to go
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I saw ``Hurlyburly'' on Broadway in 1984, it was full of
terrific actors (William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Harvey Keitel)
trying to redeem a terrible play.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later, ``Hurlyburly'' the movie is deja vu all
over again. Some terrific performers (Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey, Meg
Ryan) try to redeem a terrible screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Jerry Seinfeld made a TV show about nothing into an
art form, playwright David Rabe, the gifted author of ``Streamers''
and ``The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel,'' essentially tried the
same thing. You could say that ``Hurlyburly'' is about a lot of
things: sex, drugs, misogyny, maleness. But at its core, it remains
a zero-effect actors' vehicle. Lots of juicy parts, no juice.
</P>
<P>
   The movie follows the play in that, aside from a few modern
touches such as cellular phones, it seems to take place in
Hollywood in the early 1980s. Eddie (Penn) and Mickey (Spacey) are
show-biz fringe dwellers. Eddie is a hothead, cokehead, you-name-it
head. He's the surface total opposite of Mickey, who's ironic and
detached. When Eddie accuses his partner of having no feelings,
Mickey responds calmly, ``No, Eddie, I just don't have your
feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Circling this unstable center is an assortment of pals and
women, the latter all written to be disposable. There's Darlene
(Robin Wright Penn), a smooth operator who could be Eddie's
salvation or his doom; Donna (Anna Paquin), a teenage runaway
dumped into Mickey and Eddie's living room as a kind of sexual CARE
package; and Bonnie (Ryan), an all-too-available sex toy and
self-described ``drug person.''
</P>
<P>
   On the male side, we have Phil (Chazz Palminteri) and Artie
(Garry Shandling). The former is a thickheaded thug with acting
aspirations, the latter a smarmy hanger-on whose eagerness to
please makes your skin crawl.
</P>
<P>
   Give Rabe credit for venturing into tricky male-female territory
long before the likes of Neil LaBute (``In the Company of Men'').
But compared to LaBute and his ilk, Rabe's observations and
dialogue seem almost dated. And more tame than scathing.
</P>
<P>
   So what's left? The same thing that was left in the original:
the performances. Everybody is good, but special mention must go to
Spacey, who makes ice-cold irony seem natural, and to Paquin, who
without much screen time cannily etches a portrait of a
self-assured tart who, with a little age and experience, will
become these guys' worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe isn't stupid, and neither is his movie. But, as the title
suggests, it's a saga in free fall that ends up in a talky,
coked-up tailspin, going nowhere . . . and not nearly fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurlyburly''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright Penn and Meg
Ryan. Directed by Anthony Drazan. Rated R for sexuality, language
and violence.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Six or so characters in search of an author _ or at
least a viable script.

 &HT;    Chemistry fizzles out of `Sight'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No, it's not as fraudulent as that big-hearted fake, ``Patch
Adams.'' But ``At First Sight'' is another one of those medical
dramas that, despite being based on fact, come off as pure
Hollywood plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn from one of the essays in ``An Anthropologist on Mars'' by
neurologist Oliver Sacks, and based on the lives of a metro Atlanta
couple, ``Sight'' focuses on a blind masseur named Virgil (Val
Kilmer) who becomes the lover of Amy (Mira Sorvino), a Manhattan
architect. She coerces him to undergo surgery that restores most of
his vision, but at a price. The act of seeing is alien to the point
of being a burden for Virgil, who must totally relearn how to live
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fascinating story, especially as it pits Virgil and Amy
against each other. As an always-sighted person, she naturally
thinks the surgery is a gift and can't understand why he might
prefer to live in the darkness, aided by cane, dog and the support
of his other senses. But, somehow, the movie never makes their
conflicted viewpoints vital.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, you can sympathize with Virgil's disappointment at his
new world: The movie is shot in wintry tones of gray and blue. It's
like opening your eyes on a new world only to find that it
resembles a walk-in freezer.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger problem is the lack of chemistry between the leads, who
seem self-protected in layers of screen-conscious narcissism. Amy
is a two-dimensional figure, one of those architects who doesn't
seem to actually work. Virgil is an impossibly noble, sweet
creation; he's not a human being, he's a plaster saint. Even his
dog seems more complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``At First Sight''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino. Directed by Irwin Winkler.
Rated PG-13 for scenes involving sexuality and nudity and for brief
strong language. At metro theaters.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 8 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Never comes into focus.

 &HT;    `Varsity Blues' letters in vulgarity
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are a few of the good ol' Texas folks we meet at the start
of ``Varsity Blues'':
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A little boy affixed to a homemade crucifix, claiming that
he's ``preparing to die for all men's sins.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A morbidly obese teenager named Billy Bob (Ron Lester), eating
nachos and Velveeta as he drives and rinsing them down with pancake
syrup. And his pet pig, Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A high school football hero named Lance (Paul Walker), with a
billboard in his front yard touting his quarterback
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And a wild teammate named Tweeder (Scott Caan), who shouts
about looking for sex while he moons his pals from the back of a
truck.
</P>
<P>
   During all this, our hero, Mox (James Van Der Beek, trying to
hang onto his country accent), opines in sincere voice-over about
how ``football is a way of life.'' So, it seems, are rotten
Hollywood movies like this.
</P>
<P>
   Be warned, people. All this happens in the first few minutes.
Even before the credits are over, ``Blues'' has ridiculed its
characters and insulted our intelligence. There ought to be some
kind of prize for that.
</P>
<P>
   Mox, a high school senior in New Canaan, Texas, plays football
with the Coyotes, but only because his dad did. He hopes to be
accepted at Brown University, and he has a dirty secret: Benched
during games, he sits there and . . . reads. He tries to hide this
vice from abusive Coach Kilmer (Jon Voight, foaming at the mouth).
With 22 district championships behind him, Kilmer's urge to win is
so strong that he risks his players' futures by shooting them up
with quick-fix painkillers after any accident.
</P>
<P>
   That's an interesting moral issue. But director Brian Robbins
(whose work is by the numbers and looks cheap too) is really more
interested in making fun of small-town eccentrics _ especially the
kids' fathers, whose gridiron dreams have shifted into beer bellies
and buried rage.
</P>
<P>
   If you want an example of a movie that can tweak small-town life
while still having some sympathy, go rent ``The Positively True
Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom.''
``Varsity Blues'' is just stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, nothing wrong with that. Stupid can be fun. I liked
``Porky's'' just fine. But at least ``Porky's'' didn't try to make
deep statements like ``Blues'' does between its shots of fat boys
puking into laundry machines or nubile teenage girls wearing only
whipped cream. It's like somebody trying to advise you what to make
of your life while wearing a clown suit and pumping a beer keg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Varsity Blues''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Van Der Beek and Jon Voight. Directed by Brian
Robbins. Rated R for strong language, sexuality, nudity and some
substance abuse. At metro theaters.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Tries to win a title in stupidity.

MIDWIVES FACE A TURF BATTLE IN DOCTOR-RICH AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Obstetricians, long the main source of maternity
care, are facing new competition from an old profession: Midwifery.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany County, which is home to a large number of
obstetricians and two hospitals training medical residents in
delivering babies, some physicians consider midwives a threat to
their practices.
</P>
<P>
   The rift means fewer birth options for pregnant women here.
There are no certified nurse midwives who deliver babies on a
regular basis at Albany Medical Center and only five who deliver at
another leading hospital, St. Peter's.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some women seeking prenatal care are being pushed
to other communities in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a turf issue,'' said Dr. Ellen Biggers, a obstetrician
and gynecologist in Washington County, northeast of Albany.
Biggers, who formerly worked at St. Peter's Family Health Center,
was recently appointed to the New York Board of Midwifery. She
supports the wider use of midwives, sometimes to the chagrin of her
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're uncomfortable with me saying that there are ways in
which midwifery care is superior,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, many obstetricians ``really feel the patients
won't get the best care'' from certified nurse midwives.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Albert Ellman, a longtime Albany-area obstetrician and
gynecologist and the vice president-elect for the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' District 2 in New York,
downplayed the notion of a turf battle between physicians and
midwives. ``I don't feel there is any prejudice on the part of
practicing obstetricians in the area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that with an abundance of Albany obstetricians,
along with medical residents needing practice in delivering babies,
nurse midwifes will lose out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your density of practicing obstetricians is high, you're
going to find you don't have the access to certified nurse midwives
as in other areas,'' Ellman said.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict arises as research shows that certified nurse
midwives can deliver high quality obstetrical care at a
substantially lower cost than physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a certified nurse midwife here is reimbursed 60
percent to 65 percent of what a physician is reimbursed by an
insurance company for a delivery.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, an increasing number of women are looking for
alternatives to the traditional birth experience.
</P>
<P>
   The number of midwife attended births in the United States has
increased every year since 1975, when the American College of
Nurse-Midwives began tracking the information. In 1996, the total
number of midwife attended births was 229,855, up from 19,686 in
1975.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers of midwives also continues to increase nationally
and in New York state. In New York, there are 774 certified nurse
midwives, up from 336 in 1995, a year after the state began
licensing them.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse midwives differ from physicians in that they usually will
coach a woman throughout her entire labor. In an approach that
highlights their philosophy toward birth, midwives speak of
``catching'' babies rather than delivering them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midwives are like life guards, they don't jump in unless they
have to,'' said Joann Bonafede, a Schenectady nurse midwife.
</P>
<P>
   Although certified nurse midwives can authorize pain medication,
they cannot perform Caesarean sections or use forceps. By law, all
certified nurse midwives are required to have a collaborative
agreement with a physician to assist them with those complicated
pregnancies and births, and to have admitting privileges at
hospitals.

   EXCLUSIVE-CUBA-REBELS (Guatemala) _ When terrorist bombs began
to explode in 1997 amid the tight security of Fidel Castro's Cuba,
speculation about the bombers' identity was rampant: Coup-minded
military officers, some Cuban exiles insisted, or perhaps
right-wing infiltrators from Miami. But the story of the accused
saboteurs, assembled from interviews with the five men in a Havana
prison and the accounts of their relatives, associates and others
in Central America, suggests that even as radical Cuban exiles
mounted their most intense campaign of violence in years against
the Communist government, their operations were less

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   From the 1940s to the 1960s, the 18-mile stretch of beaches,
coves and lagoons at the tip of western Mexico's Baja Peninsula was
an exclusive hideaway for the rich and famous, according to Bob
Schulman, an airline executive from Aurora, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, he says, you could spot the silky set's private
planes and yachts everywhere. Erroll Flynn, Tyrone Power, Lana
Turner and the gang came down for a few days to fish in waters
teeming with marlin and sailfish. Some stars hunted; others cut a
quiet deal away from the office.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, a rutted dirt road linked the two main cities:
Cabo San Lucas (Cape of St. Luke) at the southern end of the strip
and San Jose del Cabo (St. Joseph of the Cape) at the northern end.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the region encompassing the two cities, as well as the
resort hotels dotting the stretch between them, is called Los Cabos
(the Capes), or Cabo for short. And mature travelers from the
United States now pour in from some of the top cruise ships, and on
the jets of a half-dozen major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   All told, about 22 different cruise ships stop at Cabo each
year, some once a week. Cabo typically hosts two to four ships a
week from Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Princess and Holland America.
They anchor a half-mile out on the bay at Cabo San Lucas. From
there, it's a 10-minute ride by ships' tender or water taxi to the
dock.
</P>
<P>
   On shore, visitors usually have the better part of a day to take
in as much of the city and surrounding areas as they can.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman says it's easy to get around. Just sign up for a
four-hour motorcoach tour at the cost of about $15 a person. Or, he
suggests that several travelers share a rental car and reduce
sightseeing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is a four-wheel motorbike called an ATV
(all-terrain vehicle), which can be rented for three hours for
about $45.
</P>
<P>
   To share a van with three or four others, the tab for a ride
from Cabo San Lucas to San Jose del Cabo and back runs about $8 per
person. Or for a closer look at how residents live, take a local
bus between the two towns with many stops along the way _ all for
about $1 per person one way.
</P>
<P>
   World-class fishing is still a big draw (200-pounders are
considered lightweights here), but rods and reels are fast sharing
the stage with mashies and putters.
</P>
<P>
   So far, developers have created four championship golf courses,
Schulman says. Each is a well-watered oasis surrounded by deserts,
spiky Joshua trees and breathtaking views of the Sea of Cortes.
</P>
<P>
   If cruise passengers return for longer stays, they can bed down
in one of the area's 30-plus resort hotels, which offer close to
4,500 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon are another 1,500 rooms that are being built by such
chains as the Ritz Carlton and Fiesta Americana. Local officials
predict growth to as many as 10,000 rooms _ half the size of
Mexico's premier resort at Cancun _ over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Among the luxury hotels that have sprouted on Cabo's beaches and
hillsides in recent years are the Westin Regina, Melia Cabo Real,
Las Ventanas al Paraiso, Pueblo Bonito and its all-suite sister
resort the Pueblo Bonito Rose.
</P>
<P>
   The two latter hotels, which look out on the bay from El Medano
Beach, typify the area's distinctive Mediterranean-style
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Cabo's dining spots range from fast-food franchises (McDonald's,
Domino's Pizza, KFC and so forth) to traditional Mexican eateries
to the gourmet offerings of fine restaurants with names such as
Alfonso's, Peacock's and Da Georgio's.
 &UR; ABOUT THE TOWNS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nestled along a mile-long bay, Cabo San Lucas (population
35,000, and growing fast) is where the action is. Shops, designer
arcades and dozens of lively cantinas line the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The Baja Peninsula ends about a mile out from the city at a huge
rock formation called El Arco (the arch), Cabo's signature
landmark.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's most awesome natural wonders, El Arco is
often shown in the TV series ``Land's End,'' which was taped around
Cabo.
 &UR; SAN JOSE DEL CABO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to upbeat Cabo San Lucas, San Jose del Cabo is a
laidback, pleasant city of meandering streets and lush palm groves.
It is home to 24,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose made the maps in 1730 when the Jesuits built a mission
there. It later gained some prominence as a trading center for
passing ships.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman says that despite a recently completed golf course and
seven resort hotels, San Jose still retains the charm of its
colonial heritage.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests a visit to the funky little town of Todos Santos
(All Saints) 75 miles up the coast where the 200-year-old village
offers a mix of some 3,000 locals, mostly farming families, and 350
or so North American expatriates.
</P>
<P>
   Their paintings, carvings, stoneware and other crafts are sold
in galleries that dot the village's pot-holed avenidas. With the
artists have come some toney restaurants, one of which, the Cafe
Santa Fe, is worth the trip, Schulman says.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Todos Santos' best-known landmark, the Hotel
California _ the one in the Eagles' song of the '70s. Back then,
the inn was a favorite haunt for hippies wandering across western
Mexico. They rented hammocks for $2 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman spent an hour or so in the hotel's bar listening to _
what else? _ Eagles' tunes blasting away virtually nonstop on the
CD player.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a time capsule from the '70s,'' said one pub
patron, a dentist from Mexico City who was playing hooky from a
convention in Cabo. ``I just can't wait to tell everyone I was at
the real Hotel California. And I've got a Hotel California T-shirt
to prove it.'' (At $20 each, no less.)
</P>
<P>
   For information about Cabo, contact your travel agent or call

<P>
   The urge to suddenly hop on a plane and head for the mountains
of Utah or Colorado is the dream of many skiers and snowboarders.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that with a bit of planning, any skier can head
for the hills at a moment's notice. In fact, with the exception of
Christmas and Presidents' week, the entire ski season is fair game
for a last-minute trip at a price that won't inflict bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the clear advantages to traveling at the last minute is
having much more control over the weather. That's been especially
important during an early ski season like this one, when warm
temperatures and lack of snowfall made for less-than-ideal
conditions in the Rockies and New England but left Lake Tahoe
resorts like Squaw Valley and Northstar-at-Tahoe with a snow
bounty.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling last-minute allows skiers to seek out the optimum
conditions to make the most of their limited skiing time.
</P>
<P>
   Some ski tour operators have been known to promise skiers that
they can get them to the slopes within 24 hours. That's certainly
possible, but getting documents like airline tickets sent to a
skier via overnight mail makes such extreme short-notice trips
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Most ski tour operators, travel agents or central resrvations
offices can't promise such a quick turnaround. The minimum amount
of time for last-minute Western ski trips, from either the East or
West Coast, is typically three days. The cost, remarkably enough,
is usually the same as it would be three months out plus whatever
the FedEx charges are.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, in the age of Web travel, last-minute ski vacations
may be one of the last vestiges of an established system that
relies on travel agents, ski tour operators or a ski resort's
central reservations office to make travel plans.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is airfare. Try to get a domestic airline ticket from
the Web or directly from an airline without a seven-day advance
purchase or a Saturday night stay and the fares are prohibitively
expensive, often full-fare economy.
</P>
<P>
   But travel professionals such as ski tour operators negotiate
contracts for cheap, bulk-rate airfares with the airlines months
before the season commences. Provided that those seats are still
available, they have access to them up to 24 hours before a flight
leaves. What's more, bulk airfares are not subject to Saturday
night stay-overs or advance-purchase restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   To find these unsold fares, the best last-minute strategy is to
avoid flying weekends, to take whatever airline is available and to
be flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ski tour operators, the central reservations offices of
major ski areas have access to these fares and packages as well.
One advantage to working with them is that they know their
properties inside and out. They're geared to act as a clearinghouse
for unsold rooms, which are generally sold for the same price as an
advance booking.
</P>
<P>
   They know which hotel or condo has a last-minute cancellation or
who may be offering a discount during a slow week. They can be
especially helpful to skiers who are driving to their destination,
whether it's Colorado's Summit County or Vermont's Green Mountains.
Without air to worry about, there's a lot more flexibility in days,
arrival times and location.
</P>
<P>
   Availability, of course, is the key. Skiers stand a much better
chance of getting into ski resorts with a large number of beds _
places like Vail or Killington _ than they do at smaller resorts
like Big Sky or Taos.
</P>
<P>
   And as the saying goes, money isn't everything. Even skiers who
want and can afford pricier lodgings such as The Sonnenalp in Vail
or The Little Nell in Aspen may find that they're in such demand
that they're all but impossible to get into at the last minute. But
with flexible expectations, it's possible to find accommodations in
a place that's comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   For those who are flying, and assuming cost is a consideration,
the cheapest flights are usually to the larger airports that serve
multiple resorts, such as Denver, Colorado Springs, Salt Lake City
and Reno. All of these airports benefit from direct flights and
airline competition.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to ski areas like Aspen, Jackson Hole or Telluride is
more problematic. A two-flight destination means purchasing two
last-minute tickets, perhaps on two different airlines, which
sharply reduces the odds of getting a good price and actually
getting on a plane.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the time factor to consider. Many last-minute trips
are just three or four days long. An extra flight eats into skiing
time and greatly increases the chance of weather-related delays.
</P>
<P>
   To optimize last-minute travel options, think seasonally. In the
late season, count on going after April 1 to take advantage of a
season's worth of snow, not to mention empty airline seats and
hotel rooms. Here are some ski tour operators to contact:

   The urge to suddenly hop on a plane and head for the mountains
of Utah or Colorado is the dream of many skiers and snowboarders.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that with a bit of planning, any skier can head
for the hills at a moment's notice. In fact, with the exception of
Christmas and Presidents' week, the entire ski season is fair game
for a last-minute trip at a price that won't inflict bankruptcy.

   IMPEACH-MCCARTY _ It's official: Larry Flynt isn't just your
hometown smut peddler any more. He's a folk hero for the First
Amendment; no, he's an elder statesman and king un-maker; no, he's
a member of the ``new media,'' as Newsweek christened him this
week. Whew. Makes you nostalgic for the days he was hawking
Bachelor Beat on the streets of downtown Dayton, for a dime an
issue. Now he's forking over millions for Congressional sleaze.
There are few things more enjoyable than watching other people's
hypocrisy being exposed. Some are even arguing that Flynt is the
cure for all of our political ills, a sign that things have sunk so
low they can only get better. But Larry Flynt isn't the cure for
what ails Washington. He's one of its most revolting symptoms. And
those of us who are troubled by the process that brought us to
Clinton's impeachment _ by all the book deals, nose jobs, modeling
contracts swirling around the allegations against the president _
should be the first to repudiate Flynt's attempts to buy political
revelations. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News). 15.

   HEALTH-SURVEY _ WASHINGTON _ Americans are concerned about the
future of Social Security and Medicare, but are in no mood for
painful remedies, according to a recent survey. This attitude will

   CHINA-VOTING _ BEIJING _ Election observers from The Carter
Center in Atlanta broke Thursday from their upbeat assessment of
local elections in China, issuing a largely negative report on
balloting they found riddled with ``irregularities in almost all
stages.'' Despite the drawbacks, observers applauded the enthusiasm
of Chinese voters. And at least some were perplexed that China has
maintained this sliver of openness when it is in the midst of a
crackdown on pro-democracy activists in the big cities.

   KING _ The U.S. Park Service prepares for the ``massive job'' of
cataloging the contents of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s home as the
nation prepares to honor the man who would have reached the age of
70 today. The park service is moving ahead with its plans to buy
King's Atlanta home, said to be just as it was the last day he was
in it, although his wife Coretta has never moved out. After the
sale, many of King's personal items will go on public display for
the first time. We update the park service's plans to buy virtually
the entire King historic site, including King's birth home, the
administrative building of the King Center, and Freedom Hall. The
family is to continue the work of the King Center for Social Change
after the sale of the building in which it resides.

   BUSH-LEGIS _ The first week of the legislative session is over
today, and for Gov. George W. Bush, at least, things haven't been
falling his way. The proposed state budget contains too little
money for the amount of tax cuts he had proposed and his proposal
to end social promotion has become optional under legislation filed
by the Republican senator who chairs the education committee.
(Brooks, Austin American-Statesman).

<P>
   TEXAS-WATER-POLICY _ The legislative skirmishing has begun on
one of the most contentious issues in Texas water policy, the
transfer of water from one region of the state to another.

AT SOME CORPORATIONS, E-MAIL MOVES AT A SNAIL'S PACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Have a question about gas? Texaco can answer
your electronic mail in about four minutes. Have an e-mail query
for the high-tech Hewlett-Packard company? It may take 23 days to
get a response. The MCI telecommunications company may never
respond.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the results of a survey conducted by Brightware Inc.,
a Novato, Calif.-based company that produces software designed to
help corporations manage e-mail correspondence from customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how bad the situation is out there with customer
service on the Internet,'' said Chuck Williams, the chief executive
of Brightware. ``We thought it would be quite illuminating to get a
good picture of how companies are or aren't doing with customer
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Brightware surveyed Fortune 100 companies that accepted e-mail.
Those who responded fastest were awarded with a Swift-E title.
Laggards were given a Tard-E. A Snub-E was tacked onto those
companies that failed to answer e-mail in more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco was very happy to hear its ranking on the survey, which
graded companies on how they responded to an e-mail sent during
business hours asking for a corporate address.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's wonderful,'' said Faye Cox, a spokeswoman for White
Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco. ``We take our e-mail very seriously, and
we try to answer it as quickly and thoroughly as possible. I'm glad
to see our efforts paying off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, its a fluke,'' said Hewlett-Packard spokeswoman Amy
Flores. ``But its definitely an embarrassing situation. It
shouldn't have taken that long.''
</P>
<P>
   MCI spokesman Charlie Sutlive said he was stymied by the results
of the survey. ``Our goal is to respond to every customer within 24
to 48 hours,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, several of those companies that were either very
late or failed to respond to e-mail are Brightware customers.
Williams said those companies had not yet set up their e-mail
packages. Williams also said that not one company in the Swift-E
category was a Brightware software user.
</P>
<P>
   So then, why the survey? ``This is an industrywide problem,''
Williams said. ``It's not a Brightware issue. We happen to have a
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The survey,'' he said, ``is being put out there in the
interest of the companies and the consumers.''

   PHOENIX - Eddie: ``You look great.''

   Eddie and Darlene are in love in that Hollywood way, which

   They're both trapped in ``Hurlyburly,'' the latest in a growing

   Eddie (Sean Penn) and Mickey (Kevin Spacey) are partners in a

their lives consist of doing drugs, abusing women and overanalyzing
their every thought.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie is the more intense one in that LA coked-out way, while
Mickey is more mature, which in show biz means he's into smug
sarcasm instead of Eddie's hyped motormouthings.
</P>
<P>
   The men are not exactly friends, just part of each other's
dementia.
</P>
<P>
   So is Phil (Chazz Palminteri), a bit-part actor who introduces
the threat of violence into their manic existence.
</P>
<P>
   When all three men aren't going through the spirals of their
relationship problems, they're tearing each other apart in an often
witty, always anguished form.
</P>
<P>
   David Rabe adapted his own play to create ``Hurlyburly'' and
capture the venal, vapid pretensions of people who assume their
Hollywood lives are normal because they have the money to pay for
their excesses.
</P>
<P>
   If you enjoyed the comedy of venom mapped out with ``In the
Company of Men'' and ``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' then
``Hurlyburly'' is as strong a debasement of the human spirit as
those.
</P>
<P>
   The acting propels the movie, with all three stars locked onto
their characters' neuroses. But when you give actors characters
they're overly familiar with, you can expect them to nail it.
</P>
<P>
   Meg Ryan has a small part as a drugged-out stripper. It's one of
those anti-Meg moments she likes to do, but she even plays a zonked
semihooker as perky.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's shortfall is that if you spend too much time with
people who overanalyze their need to overanalyze, who are
distracted by their observations of how distracted they are, you
want to run as far away from them as you can get. That's how you
may feel halfway through ``Hurlyburly.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the life it depicts, ``Hurlyburly'' has nowhere to go,
which drags us down with Eddie and Mickey.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the movie has its moments of lucidity, as when Eddie
whines, ``I've been having a rough time,'' and the stripper informs
him, ``Well, it's been a rough century all around, Eddie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurlyburly'' is rated R for profanity, sex and nudity. 3
stars. &QL;

TV TREADS LIGHTLY IN PC NATION 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Hollywood may be a cultural island, as many
outspoken critics of entertainment believe it to be, but it is
mighty susceptible to the chilling effects of political
correctness.
</P>
<P>
   This is a pattern we have seen get stronger over the past five
or so years. And nothing could be worse for quality programming.
Although television isn't associated with art in quite the same way
as film, it certainly should be. On its best days, television makes
great use of being the most powerful medium on the planet and
transports the viewer to higher ground.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, its average days produce the kind of low-watt
quality that most people associate with everyday TV. The hackneyed
sitcom with the trite laugh track, the predictable TV movie and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   But for sheer volume _ new shows come on across the dial every
day _ TV produces a high percentage of quality programming. The
fact that any of it is good in the current environment is
miraculous. No other entertainment industry is as influenced by
squeaky wheels as this one.
</P>
<P>
   People who produce TV shows here are acutely aware of how easily
frightened the networks get.
</P>
<P>
   One reason there was such a backlash against the TV ratings
campaign was because of the possible chilling effects of
self-censorship. Make no mistake _ money moves everything. Fifty
years after the fact it is still about selling soap. Any TV show
that could be stuck with restrictive labels (language, violence,
etc.) ran the risk of losing advertisers from the start, a fact
that has had ramifications in the creative process.
</P>
<P>
   Far more influential _ and insidious _ is the threat of boycott.
This is a weapon that has grown ever stronger, and thus more
popular, in our cowering politically correct times. It is almost
laughable to think that a show like ``All in the Family'' could get
made now. The environment has changed so dramatically that TV
producers wouldn't even waste their time with such a hot-button
show or they would take it to cable first, never even considering
the networks (which are, despite viewership increases in cable, the
mainstream TV outlet for most of America).
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when a boycott could help launch a network, as
the furor over ``Married ... With Children'' did for Fox. Last
season, before it aired, a campaign against ``The Secret Diary of
Desmond Pfeiffer'' denounced the show about a black butler in
Abraham Lincoln's White House. The show was lousy anyway and
certainly in poor taste, but it wasn't racist as the charges
suggested. The show was panned and quickly pulled.
</P>
<P>
   This season similar charges were leveled against Fox's ``The
PJs,'' the first ever prime-time black animated show. ``The PJs''
has been denounced as furthering black stereotypes even though
Eddie Murphy is the executive producer and five of the 10 writers
are black.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PJs'' scored record ratings in its Sunday debut for Fox
and is in no danger of being canceled. But the voices against it
are unlikely to go quiet any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   What constitutes ``offensive'' these days is a much longer list
than in years past. Some producers believe that we were more
creatively forgiving as recently as the 1980s, which is a sobering
thought given the relatively tame material that dominated
television then.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just race issues that raise the sensitive hackles
on our PC nation. It is tone _ and that is more frightening because
it is less obvious. Are we nearing a time when everyone is so
thin-skinned that a TV show won't be able to make sport of
behavior, much less race, gender or sexual preference?
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, there appear to be a few colonies of
boldness finally coming out of Hollywood. This season we have seen
the anything-goes attitude of ``Rude Awakenings'' (alcoholism and
sexual promiscuity) and ``Linc's'' (reverse black stereotyping and
the issues that raises). Of course, those series are on Showtime, a
cable outlet.
</P>
<P>
   But post-``Ellen,'' there has been gay skewering and sendups on
NBC's wonderful ``Will &AMP; Grace'' show. CBS's ``Becker,'' which was
created to tweak PC ideology, is proving effective if not subtle.
Comedy Central's ``The Daily Show'' has been by far the most
proudly edgy and dangerous show on television. ABC's ``Politically
Incorrect'' talk show continues to be fearless.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's animated ``Family Guy'' has a mean-spirited man-child in
it (animation always pushes the proverbial envelope).
</P>
<P>
   But there are two shows in particular to watch out for. CBS's
``Payne'' stars John Larroquette in a remake of ``Fawlty Towers,''
the British cult fave from John Cleese. And ABC's ``The Norm Show''
has Norm MacDonald taking no prisoners with his blunt comedy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald's new show is hilarious and it is unlikely to be toned
down. He calls his boss ``ass-face'' in one scene and has a pretty
funny segment in a ``massage'' parlor. ``We had lots of
conversations with the Standards and Practices people,'' said
executive producer Bruce Helford. ``It was rougher before.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't expect MacDonald to pull any punches. He said
President Clinton and Congress opened the door: ``Listen, as far as
I'm concerned, if inserting a cigar into a woman's vagina's a
crime, I'm (expletive) Dillinger.''
</P>
<P>
   Larroquette said he would not have signed on to do a remake of
``Fawlty Towers'' if he could not make fun of people. He is hoping
the PC pendulum is swinging back the other way, since he can't
imagine getting away with the things he did on ``Night Court'' in
the '80s. But he's going to try to recreate the ``misanthropic and
sort of nasty and sort of mean little boy'' he was then.
</P>
<P>
   John Peaslee, executive producer for ``Payne,'' thinks the time
is right. ``I think the rules have changed in favor of the writers
over the last six months. ... Ever since the Clinton scandal, I've
noticed that the Standards and Practices have just changed
completely and sometimes the things (we) put into scripts, we're
just waiting for them to be taken out, and it just comes back
saying, ``OK, go ahead and shoot it.''

`THE THIN RED LINE' WAVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - ``The Thin Red Line'' falls under the big red shadow
of ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be unfair to Terrence Malick's World War II drama, but
it's also inescapable, because the two movies share a vision of war
as the doom of ordinary men.
</P>
<P>
   While ``The Thin Red Line'' is more reflective about men
struggling to stay alive amid rampant death, it doesn't have the
gut impact and short-breathed intensity of ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the James Jones novel, ``The Thin Red Line'' takes
place during the infantry battle for the island of Guadalcanal, a
key moment in World War II when the Americans had a chance to turn
the Japanese back from their invasion of the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Malick, the maverick director who hasn't made a film since
``Days of Heaven'' 20 years ago, begins his war movie in a strange
way, with two GIs enjoying a peaceful interlude swimming in the
surf with Melanesian islanders. But the soldiers turn out to be
AWOL, and the peace doesn't last.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we advance to Guadalcanal, where Company C is given the
tough job of taking a fortified hill from the entrenched enemy.
Over the course of a two-day battle, we share the long interior
reflections of the men from Company C and hours of griping
shattered by instants of death.
</P>
<P>
   While the story involves dozens of soldiers, four of them
dominate the action:
</P>
<P>
   - Lt. Col. Tall (Nick Nolte), who has finally gotten his chance
to command a battle and is determined to win it at any cost;
</P>
<P>
   - Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel), a philosopher who seeks calmness in
the middle of bloody madness;
</P>
<P>
   - Pvt. Bell (Ben Chaplin), a resolute soldier fortified by
memories of the loving wife he left behind; and
</P>
<P>
   - Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn), who uses cynicism as a survival
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thin Red Line'' casts its strongest spell during the
jungle battle for the hill. But the movie doesn't end there. It
wanders around the islands, through events, and among survivors,
many of whom you may not remember seeing in the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Although Malick hasn't made a movie in two decades, he hasn't
lost his touch for eye-catching vistas and the poetics of conflict.
He captures the mix of courage, cowardice and chaos that imbues
battle movies with that there-but-for-the-grace-of-God sense. But
he fails to catch us up in the rush of war or in the plight of the
individuals caught in its fury, as Spielberg did so well in
``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Malick rambles through what dozens of soldiers are
thinking during brief respites from battle and repeated nature
shots of island animals. Undoubtedly, Malick is making some point
that nature is cruel but men are crueler, or perhaps that nature is
indifferent to our struggles. But the point doesn't add much to the
story.
</P>
<P>
   There are too many actors passing briefly through the film for
any performances to dominate. This is a movie crafted by writer and
director. The unimportance of the actors is accentuated by the
throw-away cameos of too many stars _ John Travolta, George
Clooney, Woody Harrelson, John Cusack _ who distract from the
reality of the combat tale.
</P>
<P>
   Malick's other misstep: While he shows us the fear of men in
battle over and over again, he misses entirely the other side of
fear: bravado, which is also present in any fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thin Red Line'' might have stood out more strongly a war
story if it wasn't for the overwhelming shadow of ``Saving Private
Ryan.'' But even strictly taken as a battle movie, it doesn 't
rival ``Platoon,'' ``Full Metal Jacket'' or ``Hamburger Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thin Red Line'' is rated R for violence, profanity and
nudity. 3 stars. &QL;

HOLLYWOOD EXCESSES PROVE FUNNY, PAINFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Eddie: ``You look great.''
</P>
<P>
   Darlene: ``Facade.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie: ``What isn't?''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie and Darlene are in love in that Hollywood way, which
means: Let's use each other as long as it doesn't get ugly or
interfere with our phone messages.
</P>
<P>
   They're both trapped in ``Hurlyburly,'' the latest in a growing
film genre: the comedy of pain.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie (Sean Penn) and Mickey (Kevin Spacey) are partners in a
casting agency and share a house in the Hollywood hills, where
their lives consist of doing drugs, abusing women and overanalyzing
their every thought.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie is the more intense one in that LA coked-out way, while
Mickey is more mature, which in show biz means he's into smug
sarcasm instead of Eddie's hyped motormouthings.
</P>
<P>
   The men are not exactly friends, just part of each other's
dementia.
</P>
<P>
   So is Phil (Chazz Palminteri), a bit-part actor who introduces
the threat of violence into their manic existence.
</P>
<P>
   When all three men aren't going through the spirals of their
relationship problems, they're tearing each other apart in an often
witty, always anguished form.
</P>
<P>
   David Rabe adapted his own play to create ``Hurlyburly'' and
capture the venal, vapid pretensions of people who assume their
Hollywood lives are normal because they have the money to pay for
their excesses.
</P>
<P>
   If you enjoyed the comedy of venom mapped out with ``In the
Company of Men'' and ``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' then
``Hurlyburly'' is as strong a debasement of the human spirit as
those.
</P>
<P>
   The acting propels the movie, with all three stars locked onto
their characters' neuroses. But when you give actors characters
they're overly familiar with, you can expect them to nail it.
</P>
<P>
   Meg Ryan has a small part as a drugged-out stripper. It's one of
those anti-Meg moments she likes to do, but she even plays a zonked
semihooker as perky.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's shortfall is that if you spend too much time with
people who overanalyze their need to overanalyze, who are
distracted by their observations of how distracted they are, you
want to run as far away from them as you can get. That's how you
may feel halfway through ``Hurlyburly.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the life it depicts, ``Hurlyburly'' has nowhere to go,
which drags us down with Eddie and Mickey.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the movie has its moments of lucidity, as when Eddie
whines, ``I've been having a rough time,'' and the stripper informs
him, ``Well, it's been a rough century all around, Eddie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurlyburly'' is rated R for profanity, sex and nudity. 3
stars. &QL;

   NY-PUBS (New York) _ Some people walk into a bar to drink.
Others pursue a loftier goal. Yes, they order a drink, but for them
the bar is a haven for reflection, a seat of learning and even,
perhaps, a house of worship. In New York City, dedicated
single-malt drinkers fall squarely into the second category. With
the sensitivity of a parfumeur and the tenacity of a celebrity
stalker, they seek the finest that Scotland can coax out of
fermented barley. Price is no object. These days, the single-malt
fanatics are a happy bunch. By William Grimes.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (`i' code)
</P>
<P>
   EXCLUSIVE-CUBA-REBELS (Guatemala) _ When terrorist bombs began
to explode in 1997 amid the tight security of Fidel Castro's Cuba,
speculation about the bombers' identity was rampant: Coup-minded
military officers, some Cuban exiles insisted, or perhaps
right-wing infiltrators from Miami. But the story of the accused
saboteurs, assembled from interviews with the five men in a Havana
prison and the accounts of their relatives, associates and others
in Central America, suggests that even as radical Cuban exiles
mounted their most intense campaign of violence in years against
the Communist government, their operations were less
cloak-and-dagger than cut-rate and lucky. By Tim Golden.

   IMPEACH-OBSTRUCT (Washington) _ The crime of obstruction of
justice with which Clinton is charged is one of those grab-bag
charges for prosecutors like conspiracy and fraud. In fact, the
House managers have thrown together a series of accusations to make
a case of obstruction that some have criticized as ``bundling'' _

NO EXCUSE FOR MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A cop was shot and killed. A suspect was
arrested. Three days later we learned the killing may have been the
result of a fatal misconception.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of Chad Rhodes, the suspect in Sunday's killing of
Oakland police officer James Williams Jr., said her 19-year-old son
was scarred for life because he was conceived in Jonestown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jonestown link in cop slaying,'' said the headline in the San
Francisco Examiner. ``Mom says suspect is scarred by Guyana
tragedy, not knowing who father is.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounded like a preview of one of those pleas to save a guy
from the death penalty based on his troubled childhood. But this
took the trouble back to the point of conception.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to blame the suspect's mom, Juanita Bogue, for
connecting her son's place of conception to a night on an overpass,
when he allegedly took aim with an assault rifle at a police
officer searching the side of a highway for a discarded gun.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Bogue is in a world of hurt because of the killing
and her son's arrest. As a young woman she escaped a closed
universe of hurt known as the People's Temple, which lost 900
members to Jim Jones' poison in 1978 _ soon after Chad Rhodes was
conceived into a life where he would never know his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything around his life has been trauma,'' Bogue said. ``He
may even go to the electric chair and not even know who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a chilling statement, whatever you think of the idea of the
troubled-childhood excuse.
</P>
<P>
   However, Officer Williams, who was 41 years old with three
children, was fresh out of the police academy, and never lived to
know how much he could do for his city. His younger children may
grow up with little memory their father.
</P>
<P>
   Never having known one's father is a common enough condition in
America. Even President Clinton never knew his father. Never having
known one's father is no excuse for taking deliberate aim and
shooting a policeman, as Rhodes is accused of doing.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody should pay a price for that, and there are no discounts
given for having had a tough life plus nine months.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that a criminal is just another kind of victim is at
least as old as Leopold and Loeb, the collegiate kidnap-murderers
whom Clarence Darrow defended in 1924 by blaming Nietzsche for
putting ideas of being ``Ubermenschen'' in their arrogant young
heads.
</P>
<P>
   Lately it seems everybody facing the death penalty is portrayed
as a victim, usually of poverty, child abuse or grim childhoods.
Such excuses rub most Americans the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   They run contrary to our notions of free will, responsibility
for one's actions and obligation to try to overcome life's
obstacles. They demean the accomplishments of people who have done
good things despite bad childhoods.
</P>
<P>
   What intrigues us here is a suspect facing the death penalty
being portrayed not only as the victim of a grim childhood, but a
horrible pre-childhood _ not even fetal alcohol syndrome, but the
external circumstances that led to the fetus itself.
</P>
<P>
   And it was in a meeting of sperm and egg in a killing field that
this area never will escape. This case may be one more aftershock
of the events in Guyana in 1978, whatever happened to cause the
senseless killing of Officer Williams.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think the killing can be traced to a young man's
conception, but Jonestown evokes such strong revulsion that you
could foresee a lawyer trying to make it a mitigating circumstance
in the penalty phase of a trial.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of the misconception defense, in lighter form, can
be traced back at least as far as 1760 to Lawrence Sterne's
satirical novel ``Tristram Shandy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the opening line, narrator Tristram Shandy argues that he
would have been a different man ``If either my father or my mother,
or indeed both of them, as they were in duty both equally bound to
it, had minded what they were doing when they begot me ...''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of conception, his mother asked his father if he
had remembered to wind the clock, and this ``scattered and
dispersed the animal spirits'' which are ``transferred from father
to son.''
</P>
<P>
   But for that deflating question about the clock, says Shandy,
``I should have made a quite different figure in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, we all should have made quite different figures in the
world, but for something our parents did. Unlike Shandy, though, we
don't blame our faults on the circumstances in which they conceived
us.
</P>
<P>
   A friend said he was conceived in England near Berkeley Castle,
where King Edward II was murdered in circumstances most foul. My
friend doesn't expect he will be caught wielding implements of
torture.
</P>
<P>
   I was conceived in a motel in Fort Pierce, Fla., where my dad
was stationed in the Navy. Floridians didn't buy it when I claimed
in a column in the Orlando Sentinel that I was a ``conceptual
native.''
</P>
<P>
   However, as much as we scoff at the idea that place of
conception can determine character, there's something horribly
special about the place called Jonestown. It's a place that haunts
us, and keeps coming back.
</P>
<P>
   I just hope it doesn't come back as an excuse, because as
Jonestown and the rest of human history teaches us, there's no
excuse for murder.

ARMY SEEKS TO RECRUIT MORE HISPANICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Army Secretary Luis Caldera is pledging to boost
the recruitment of Hispanics into a service struggling to meet
personnel needs, even if it means easing educational requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not having graduated from high school shouldn't be a bar from
military service if you subsequently can demonstrate that you have
the desire and the ability to be successful,'' Caldera said
Wednesday after speaking to Hispanic leaders in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than half of all Hispanics graduate from high
school. That automatically slams the door on all but a few dropouts
because the military requires most of its recruits to hold a high
school diploma. The service does admit some people with graduate
equivalency degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics make up 5.5 percent of Americans in uniform, although
they represent 11.4 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity prompted Rep. Ciro D. Rodriguez, D-Texas, and the
Congressional Hispanic Caucus to ask Caldera for a renewed emphasis
on the recruiting of Hispanics. The Harvard-educated Caldera and
Rodriguez, who quit ninth grade but later returned to earn his high
school diploma, noted that colleges and businesses accept those
with equivalency degrees, known as GEDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If universities can accept people with a GED or can accept
people after they've taken some remediation, then the same thing
should apply to the military,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera's call for more Hispanics in the Army comes as all the
services are struggling to meet their recruiting goals. Both the
Army and Navy last year failed to find enough young men and women
to fill their ranks. The Air Force also struggled to meet its goal
and has had troubled keeping pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting and retention problems have become so serious that
some conservatives in Congress have suggested that lawmakers might
have to revive the draft if the trend worsens. The lack of recruits
entering the services is blamed largely on the healthy economy and
a surplus of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A one-time Army officer, Caldera said he was opposed to reviving
the draft, saying that it couldn't be fairly managed and ``isn't
necessarily a good solution'' to the services' recruiting problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Army instead will take a closer look at Hispanics and others
holding GEDs, scrutinizing candidates for qualities that lend
themselves to the service's needs.
</P>
<P>
   Though details have to be worked out, Caldera said appealing to
the patriotism of high school- and college-age people and stressing
education will be part of the Army's revamped recruiting program. A
stepped-up advertising campaign that targets Hispanics also might
be in the works as the Army tries to snare more of the 1.3 million
young people who each year become eligible for service.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera noted that 37 of 160 Medal of Honor recipients are
Hispanic.

   ABOUT-CARS-FERRARI-NYT (Undated) _ Selling Ferraris to Americans
is no longer just a matter of flattering the customers and wearing
Armani suits really well. While the current models knock-down
gorgeous, they are also far more expensive than the Porsches, and
Jaguars that can be nearly as alluring. By Peter Passell.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-SMART-SHOW-NYT (Detroit) _ One problem with auto makers'
headlong rush to cross-breed sedans, wagons, trucks, vans and
four-by-fours is coming up with ways to categorize the new, hybrid
forms they are creating. More than a dozen such crossover vehicles
made their debuts here last week at the North American
International Auto Show, either as products soon to be sold, as
prototypes of future offerings or as design studies that may _ or
may not _ find their way into showrooms in some modified form. By
James G. Cobb.

 &HT;    PUBLIC WARY OF SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE REFORMS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans are concerned about Social Security and
Medicare but are in no mood for painful remedies, according to a
recent survey. This attitude will make it harder for lawmakers to
reform the nation's health and retirement systems this year,
experts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When and if the smoke clears on impeachment, there will be a
lot of talk about health issues and a lot of health issues on the
agenda, but there will likely be more talk than action,'' said Drew
E. Altman, president of the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation
which, in conjunction with the Harvard School of Public Health,
surveyed voter attitudes after the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Making Social Security financially sound was the No.1 issue
voters of both parties said should be ``a top priority'' for
Congress this year. That was followed by making Medicare
financially sound and helping the uninsured get health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security may not be able to pay full benefits after 2032
and the Medicare hospital trust fund could run a deficit by 2008.
</P>
<P>
   But the poll showed little public agreement over plans to alter
Social Security or Medicare, both of which have been identified by
congressional leaders and the White House for reforms this year.
</P>
<P>
   Many Social Security reform proposals center on either allowing
or requiring workers to invest some of their payroll taxes in the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser-Harvard survey found the public nearly evenly divided
on such a proposal, with 49 percent in favor and 47 percent
opposed. The poll had a 4 percent margin of error, meaning the
difference between the two views was negligible.
</P>
<P>
   Several proposals have been offered for reforming Medicare. With
the exception of reducing payments to doctors and hospitals, none
of the leading reform suggestions was supported by a majority.
</P>
<P>
   Four out of 10 voters would support raising the 2.9 percent
Medicare payroll tax, one out of three would support raising the
eligibility age from 65 to 67, and one out of seven would support
requiring the elderly to pay a larger share of Medicare costs. An
earlier poll showed that one out of five would support using
limited Medicare contributions to purchase private health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   John Rother, AARP's legislative director, said at a separate
news conference that he had never seen such a wide gap between the
public's and the politicians' goals for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   While a bipartisan congressional task force prepares to
recommend changes by March 1 to rein in future Medicare spending,
the public wants more Medicare benefits, specifically prescription
drug coverage and long-term care, Rother said.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the health issues, the one with the broadest public
support is a patient's rights bill which would include the right to
sue health maintenance organizations for denying treatments, said
Altman.

GETTING A VIDEO OF `SONG OF THE SOUTH'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find a video of Disney's ``Song of the South''?
</P>
<P>
   _ S.P., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Disney has not made the 1946 film available to U.S. audiences
on video and does not have it scheduled for 1999. ``Currently there
aren't any plans to release it,'' said Cheryl Glenn, director of
public relations for Buena Vista Home Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, rereleased to theaters in 1971 and 1986, is one of
the only Disney films that has not made it to U.S. video stores.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of press speculation that it won't be released
again because of how Uncle Remus and other African-American
characters are depicted. ``There's no official policy against it,
just a very strategic position on when we release certain titles,''
Glenn said.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, Disney has released ``Song of the South'' in
Europe as a PAL format VHS video and in Japan as a laserdisc. The
Internet auction site eBay often has copies of these for sale,
reaching prices of $70 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   To contact Disney about its video releases, write to Buena Vista
Home Entertainment, Consumer Relations, Box 908, Lakeland, Calif.
90714-0908.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Robert Redford?
</P>
<P>
   _ A.C., Shrewsbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Redford in care of Creative Artists Agency, 9830
Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, Calif. 90212.
</P>
<P>
   Redford, 61, recently received a Golden Globes best director
nomination for ``The Horse Whisperer''. He'll be directing,
producing and appearing in ``The Legend of Bagger Vance'' for
release in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, based on a Steven Pressfield novel, is about a
fictional championship golf match between Bobby Jones, Walter Hagen
and a war hero whose caddie has the secret of ``authentic swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was carbon paper invented, and by whom?
</P>
<P>
   _ H.N., Waldwick, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A: Carbon paper was invented by Ralph Wedgewood of England,
according to ``The First of Everything'' by Dennis Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Wedgewood's invention, a thin sheet of paper that was soaked in
ink and dried before use, was patented on Oct. 7, 1806. ``It was a
quantum leap,'' William Ecenbarger wrote in the Oct. 23, 1988,
Inquirer Magazine. ``Until then, copies had to be done over by
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbon paper was adapted for use with typewriters in the late
19th century.

</P>
<P>
   COXNET-WHEELS-COX _ Drive most anything on the road today, and
it's easy to overlook the Chevrolet Metro _ formerly the Geo-brand
Metro. It's a subcompact that's among the smallest, least obtrusive
cars marketed today. Low, too, is the price. Metro coupes and
sedans range from $8,993 to $10,402 with some surprising features _
including an impressive fit-and-finish quality. By Russ DeVault.
</P>
<P>
   SHARP DRIVING-COX _ My 1999 resolutions are all directed at
being a more aware, courteous and safer driver. By Linda Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT-CARS-FERRARI-NYT (Undated) _ Selling Ferraris to Americans
is no longer just a matter of flattering the customers and wearing
Armani suits really well. While the current models knock-down
gorgeous, they are also far more expensive than the Porsches, and
Jaguars that can be nearly as alluring. By Peter Passell.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-SMART-SHOW-NYT (Detroit) _ One problem with auto makers'
headlong rush to cross-breed sedans, wagons, trucks, vans and
four-by-fours is coming up with ways to categorize the new, hybrid
forms they are creating. More than a dozen such crossover vehicles
made their debuts here last week at the North American
International Auto Show, either as products soon to be sold, as
prototypes of future offerings or as design studies that may _ or
may not _ find their way into showrooms in some modified form. By
James G. Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-REVIEW-AZR (Phoenix) _ The most remarkable thing about the
Honda Civic GX, powered by compressed natural gas (CNG), is that
it's so unremarkable. The driveability of the natural-gas Civic
feels nearly identical to a run-of-the-mill, gasoline-powered
Civic. Maybe a bit light on torque at low engine speeds, but
otherwise a normal Honda experience. By Bob Golfen.
</P>
<P>
   CARS-WILLIAMS-COLUMN-TEX (Undated) _ It was 35 years ago this
April that Ford Motor Co. made automotive history by introducing a
new kind of car, a sporty coupe that became the coming-of-age icon
of the post-war baby-boomer generation. By G. Chambers Williams
III.

   The Republican Party faces a serious Y2K problem. If it doesn't
install a fix between now and the 2000 elections, it may lose not
just the presidential election but the House and Senate as well.
</P>
<P>
   And a quick fix doesn't seem likely.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of trouble are obvious, ranging from the party's
dismal showing in the '98 elections to its continuing free fall in
popularity polls. Typically, those downturns are explained as a
reaction to the party's mishandling of the Clinton impeachment, but
it's deeper than that. For the Republicans, the Clinton debacle is
really a short-term problem masking a much more serious, long-term
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of that challenge is perhaps best illustrated by the
advice given by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich to the Dark
Ages, an annual gathering of conservative power brokers held in
Phoenix over the New Year's weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can adopt as our primary slogan 'Do no harm' and simply
block liberal measures for two years and set the stage for a
Republican presidency, that is probably the most we can hope for,''
Gingrich told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Those are startling words, particularly from Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he brought the Republicans into power waving a copy of
his Contract With America, a 10-point plan laying out specifically
what the GOP intended to do if elected. Those proposals, each of
them poll-tested to draw at least 60 percent approval, represented
the Republicans' best public face, the issues they knew would get
them votes.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, most of the issues on that agenda sound as out
of date as the BeeGees and Barry Manilow. And as Gingrich's advice
suggests, the Republicans have found nothing more modern to replace
them.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, some of the contract proposals _ congressional
reform, term limits, unfunded mandates _ were window dressing that
the Republicans never intended to implement. Today, congressional
staffs are as large as ever, and once in power the Republicans
proved at least as aggressive as the Democrats in arranging
pork-barrel projects for their home districts and financial
contributors. Besides, you can't run credibly as the party of
congressional reform when you're actually running the place.
</P>
<P>
   When the Republicans talked in the contract about cutting
unnecessary regulation, it sounded good, and everyone applauded.
When that talk turned out to be a euphemism for gutting
environmental laws on behalf of industry, the cheers turned to
boos. That issue is discredited now, not to be revived for a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Other contract items _ welfare reform, eliminating the deficit _
have been achieved, with a little help from the Democrats and an
awful lot of help from a booming economy. And however you parcel
out the credit, as political issues they're no longer relevant.
</P>
<P>
   About the only item in the contract not rendered moot by time
was its insistence on massive tax cuts. In his Phoenix remarks,
Gingrich admitted that as speaker he had lost his focus on tax cuts
and suggested that his failure to push that issue hard enough had
contributed to the Republican setback in '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have had a much bigger fight in the spring over tax
cuts,'' he told his audience, suggesting that such a battle would
have helped unify the party and attract voters.
</P>
<P>
   One of Gingrich's closest advisers, Grover Norquist, makes a
similar argument in the current issue of American Enterprise
magazine, published by the conservative American Enterprise
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``National exit polls show Republicans won 65 percent of those
voters who said taxes were their top concern,'' Norquist writes,
``but that group made up only 11 percent of the electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   Norquist looks at that data and sees what he wants to see: He
argues that if Republicans had just preached tax cuts harder,
making taxes the priority of 15 percent of the electorate, ``the
GOP would likely have scored gains in the House rather than
losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But building your identity around the top concern of 11
percent of the voters seems a poor way of staying the majority
party.
</P>
<P>
   The Contract With America was also notable for what it did not
contain. It did not address culture-war controversies such as gay
rights, family planning, efforts to put organized prayer back into
public schools or other priorities of the Christian Coalition and
similar groups. Gingrich avoided those issues for the pure and
simple reason that they aren't very popular with the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich knew that a large majority of Americans want abortion
to remain safe, legal and rare. He knew that they have a healthy
and instinctive dislike for people who attempt to gain power by
bashing minorities and other groups. And he knew that they don't
want the government meddling in their private lives or making moral
judgments about their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   However, now that more practical issues on the GOP agenda have
been rendered irrelevant, the party is stuck. It had perfected the
political language on a wide range of issues, but once those issues
lost relevance, it didn't bother to upgrade. As a result, it is
left with little but cultural issues to define itself.
</P>
<P>
   And even that focal point has begun to lose its power.
</P>
<P>
   Turn again to the current issue of American Enterprise. The
cover story, ``Is America Turning a Corner?'', relates a string of
encouraging data on social problems such as crime, teenage
pregnancy, welfare rolls and even TV viewing among young people.
The premise of the story is that ``many of the social trend lines
that turned ugly in the '60s and '70s have begun to level off and
even retreat, in many cases to their lowest levels in two or three
decades,'' writes editor Karl Zinsmeister.
</P>
<P>
   However, when he was seeking writers to explore that happy turn
of events, he ran into an unexpected obstacle. Zinsmeister writes
that he was ``surprised and disappointed that many of the prominent
cultural conservatives whom I asked to comment on the trends ...
turned me down. I believe that at least some of these individuals,
after making careers out of ringing cultural alarm bells, may be
having trouble assimilating this good news.''
</P>
<P>
   There's something very familiar about that phenomenon.
Republicans have long pointed out a similar unwillingness by civil
rights leaders to admit that the country has made progress in race
relations. The leaders of the movement seem to fear that if they
acknowledge progress, they weaken their grip on the nation's
attention. The point was made most brutally by U.S. Rep. J.C.
Watts, the lone black Republican in Congress, when he referred to
the Rev. Jesse Jackson as ``a race-hustling poverty pimp.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans now face a similar challenge. If they
acknowledge the reality that the nation has turned a corner, they
strip themselves of the only issues that still define them as a
party. The trends cited by Zinsmeister, for example, take the sting
out of the familiar Gingrich riff that ``it is impossible to
maintain civilization with 12-year-olds having babies, 15-year-olds
killing each other, 17-year-olds dying of AIDS and 18-year-olds
getting diplomas they can't even read.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words would never have come from the lips of Ronald
Reagan, the prophet of American optimism. But since his departure
from the scene, Republicans have cast themselves as the sour party
of resentment and anger, the home for all of those elements of
American society disgruntled with where we seem headed.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, that strategy matched the nation's mood perfectly,
and the party prospered. But the mood of the country has changed,
and the party has not.

 &HT;    Q&AMP;A with John Travolta: A civil actor
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Men say they'll call and then they don't. Except for
John Travolta. Six times, in fact, the star of ``A Civil Action''
telephoned from his airplane one afternoon last week, all in the
name of completing an hourlong conversation with one reporter.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of journalists had been invited to Dallas to interview
the two-time Oscar nominee (for ``Saturday Night Fever'' and ``Pulp
Fiction'') and star of critical and commercial successes such as
``Primary Colors,'' ``Get Shorty'' and ``Michael.'' But bad weather
in Dallas meant Travolta's private jet from Boston was detoured to
California.
</P>
<P>
   Probably nobody took it harder than the hard-working actor and
highly skilled pilot, who insisted on conducting this interview
anyway _ no matter how many times he had to keep reconnecting from
30,000 feet up. (No, Travolta, 44, made clear, for once he wasn't
piloting the plane.) Maybe it was the intensity left over from
playing an extremely dedicated lawyer in ``A Civil Action,'' which
opened last Friday and immediately soared to No. 1 at the weekend
box office.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it was just because he likes to talk. When your career
begins with playing Vinnie Barbarino (TV's ``Welcome Back, Kotter)
and Tony Manero (``Saturday Night Fever''), then you languish in
obscurity with more misses (``Perfect'') than hits (``Look Who's
Talking'') then you're ``rediscovered'' in 1994 by Quentin
Tarantino when you're cast in ``Pulp Fiction'' _ you might have a
lot to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   About playing obstinate lawyer Jan Schlichtmann in ``A Civil
Action,'' the true story of eight Massachusetts families who sued
two major corporations for allegedly contributing to their
children's deaths by tainting their drinking water. About mistakes
made earlier in your career. About growing older as a man and actor
and even about current events and your somewhat controversial
religion, Scientology.
</P>
<P>
   Q: By rights, ``A Civil Action'' ought to be a movie that's good
for us to watch, but dull. But it's surprisingly lively, even
funny.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, I always feel that even though there's a very serious
message involved, you can still make it entertaining and sort of
``watchable.'' And I really wanted to make the character
entertaining, at least.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there anything wrong with having fun with serious
subjects?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, I think you have to. There's a certain humor and style in
the way it's told. If you don't entertain first, then people walk
out, people won't get it. It doesn't have to be likable. It has to
be watchable.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is that the word that defines you as an actor? Watchability?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yep. It just has to be intriguing enough for someone to want
to sit there and want to watch what happens next. If you like it,
that's another asset, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   You know, I didn't really like this character (Jan Schlichtmann
of ``A Civil Action''). But I knew how to make him funny and
watchable. Because he wasn't aware of his flaws. And anyone who's
sort of guileless that way is annoying to watch. But you have to
watch them. You can't believe this guy. How could he think that?
How could he be this cold? But you still want to watch him.
</P>
<P>
   I read the script aloud with my friends and by the time I got to
that line where I said, ``Well, I can appreciate the theatricality
in several dead kids,'' they laughed. The reason they were laughing
was because of the way I said it _ totally unaware of the weight
and the seriousness of those words. Then I thought, ``OK, now I'm
on to something.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no different than when I read ``Pulp Fiction'' and I was so
disgusted by the (scene with the) head blowing up in the car on my
face. I said, ``How am I going to do this?'' I didn't voice it to
Quentin (Tarantino, the director) because I didn't want him to
think I was unwilling. But I knew I had to do something to solve
that. I waited until the day that we shot it, and I said ``Can I
just change one thing? Instead of saying, `I shot Marvin,' can I
just say, `I shot Marvin in the face'? Like `I stepped on his toe.'
It totally takes it to this ridiculous humor, where _ you don't
shoot someone in the face, like it's, you know, a shaving cut.
</P>
<P>
   I can do that. I don't mind people not liking me, and then
learning to like me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you look at a point in your career where you realized,
`Oh, this is my gift as an actor. I don't care whether people like
me or not'?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, I didn't care. Because I did ``Carrie,'' where I played
this bully. And a couple of early (TV) shows I played mean-spirited
guys. And then suddenly I was very well liked for being unlikable.
So I never was afraid of that. But if you ask me if there was a
point where it became a desired quality in Hollywood, I would say
after ``Pulp Fiction.'' Because they thought no one can get away
with that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At least not more than once?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah. And I think I'm doing things really not that different
from what (James) Cagney and (Humphrey) Bogart did. I mean, they
played despicable characters. Like in ``Public Enemy'' where
(Cagney) smashes that grapefruit in that woman's face, just because
she's being annoying. I mean, that wouldn't be acceptable on the
screen today.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've made 12 movies in the last five years. Why are you
working so much?
</P>
<P>
   A: The funny thing is, that I'm not really working more than any
of the other top guys. Last year, Tom Hanks did two movies, this
year he's doing two and next year he's doing two. And that's about
my average unless I do a smaller part in a ``She's So Lovely'' or a
``Thin Red Line.'' When you're given really good scripts, you don't
not want to work, because someone else is gonna take it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you pass on too many scripts earlier in your career?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, I did. Because I was more interested in my own personal
life than I was in a career. I saw Redford and Newman and Beatty
taking two or three years off between projects and I thought,
`Well, so can I!' Except that I wasn't doing the sort of projects
that they might have been preparing for. I wasn't the same level of
quality to take those two and a half years off.
</P>
<P>
   I started out with a bang with ``Carrie,'' ``Saturday Night
Fever,'' ``Grease,'' ``Urban Cowboy,'' ``Blow Out,'' and those were
all taken very seriously and won awards. But then I got into a few
that were not taken so well, and that started getting me offered
not only less good scripts, but also, less often. And that's when I
simultaneously felt that I needed to explore the world. But that
wasn't the time to do it. That was the time to say `OK, don't
become a jet pilot now. Don't go to Africa, don't go to South
America. Don't explore your life. Keep your career going.' When
you're a young guy and you feel like you've done some good work and
created a blueprint, a foundation, for your career, and you want to
experience your life, you end up doing what you want to do anyway.
No one's gonna really talk you out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you saying you're not a young guy anymore?!
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, that's the other thing. As I get older, I'm finding
that I like being kept busy more, because it keeps my attention off
getting old! And also as one gets older, I think it's better to be
busy. I think the time to sow your oats and explore the world is
when you're younger, and that when you're older you have more of a
sense of responsibility toward what you're doing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But aren't the parts better, too?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think that there's more motivation to work because the
parts are better. Everyone who's writing is writing parts about
characters who've lived, and the actors are getting older and they
have lived. I think the great roles are for (ages) 40 to 70. Look
at Duvall. How old is he? (Duvall was 66 when ``A Civil Action''
was filmed. ) Well, there you go. Who wouldn't want that role at
66? You're not gonna get that role at 26. You're not gonna care at
26. And people aren't gonna want to watch a 26-year-old be an
eccentric lawyer. Q: Any truth to the talk that you're finally
going to get to make a film version of ``Battlefield Earth,'' (the
thriller written by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard)?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah. It will begin in July and I'm very excited. I'm
producing it with my manager, but I'm also (playing) the villain,
and I'm terrible. He is quite awful, quite wicked. This will be the
most wicked character I've ever played.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The book is pure sci-fi and has nothing to do with
Scientology?
</P>
<P>
   A: Right. And those, of course, who know science fiction are
very aware of that. The only correlation is that it's the same man
who developed Scientology, but what he used to do was write science
fiction. This is his most successful book, 4 million copies (sold),
11 countries and that's already a lot of built-in awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But would it be a bad thing if Hubbard became better known
through this movie?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, I think it would be a good thing. Because I think that
there's potential for other works of his to get done and I think
that he deserves respect as an artist as well as the founder of a
brilliant philosophy. Q: You've always been patient about
discussing Scientology. Has the level of people's understanding or
at least the tone of the questions progressed at all?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well it has, only because I don't have to kind of _ I don't
want to say ``defend'' _ but it's been sanctioned as a major
religion. It's a bonafide religion, like Catholicism or Judaism, in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   The main thing you have to deal with _ what I find just amazing
_ is that in all these years, not a single journalist has . I . I .
read a book. In 23 years of my doing interviews I had one
journalist try auditing (one of the basic processes Scientologists
undergo), but nothing was read. So what I found and find
fascinating is that there is this, almost a joy in being ignorant
about it. Because once they're educated on any level, they would
have to ask very specific questions. I'd love for once, just for
one journalist to read a pamphlet., and come back and say, `I read
this pamphlet. What does it mean there? Could you discuss that?'
You know what I mean? But it's almost like, maybe if they read it,
they would like it and be too interested.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it scary to them, do you think?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know, because nobody's afraid to look at a scary
movie. Nobody's afraid to read a scary book. How can you be scared
about reading about a philosophy? I'd have to see that person and
ask them specifically: Now, you'll do all this research on Tom
Cruise or me. You'll read tons of these awful articles about
(their) personal life or gossip, you'll read tons of it! But you
wouldn't, like, dare to read three pages of pamphlet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you've found meaning outside of moviemaking. But which of
your movies has had the most meaning for you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, this one certainly had the most impact on me. I found
last night, seeing it for the first time since the rough cut, I had
to hold myself back from crying, just because of what it must be
like to lose a child, for an insane sort of reason.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think that has to do with you having a child?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Absolutely. And there were so many times, I felt how
strong this all was _ the struggle of the people who had to kind of
withhold the truth because they were afraid of how they'd be
treated at work. Or then the joy or the integrity of them coming
forward. Risking all. You see, everybody kind of risks all in that
movie, and finally, so does Jan. So that had an impact for me.

   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; SONNY LISTON WAS A FRIEND OF MINE &QL; 
 &UR; Thom Jones (Little, Brown, $23)
</P>
<P>
   ``These swims of mine keep getting more and more rambunctious.
They are true adventures of a righteous man. Mark it down that a
brother can do. Jack Johnson of the high sea.'' This is Ondine, a
Black man, a Vietnam veteran and one of the best voices to inhabit
a short story (called ``Fields of Purple Forever'') in years.
Ondine is a savvy and easy talker, whether he is remembering what
happened during the war or describing the solitary, long-distance
swims he now makes across the English Channel, the gorge under
Niagara Falls, the Straits of Gibraltar. There is an otherworldly
strength, a solace and surety for him in the water. When he
describes it he almost makes you want to be there with him (In
Gibraltar, he says, ``at certain times, before they merge, the
edges twixt your Atlantic and Mediterranean are so sharp and
demarcated, Ondine can swim the very line half 'n' half. He can
taste the differences in salt depending on which side he breathin'
from.''). Here are 12 edgy, unflinching tales (previously published
in ``GQ,'' ``The New Yorker,'' ``Harper's,'' ``Playboy'' and other
magazines) by one of today's best story writers. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; COLLUSION &QL; 
 &UR; Evan Zimroth (HarperFlamingo, $23)
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when 13-year-old Evan Zimroth practiced at the barre,
her ballet master would move toward her and draw one of his fingers
across her forehead, then hold it down and count the beads of sweat
as they formed at his fingertip and fell to the floor. ``If I can't
get three drops,'' he would say, ``you're not working hard
enough.'' For Zimroth, this was ballet on a (begin itals) good (end
itals) day. There were times when her teacher _ Zimroth calls him
``F.'' _ would hit her with a cane, leaving marks on her body and
on her psyche. She surrendered to all of it, waited for it, loved
it, found an erotic suggestion of possession and approval in the
fact that he would single her out (for he struck only the best
dancers). Although we concede that one reader's melodrama is
another reader's delight, we'd also like to point out that there's
a thin line between eroticism and some very weird territory.
Consider this little anecdote: Once, F. invited Zimroth into his
``secret room,'' where he proceeded to cut some slices of cheese
for her. When he accidently cut his finger, he let a drop of blood
fall onto a slice of cheese, then held it to Zimroth. ``Obediently
I opened my mouth,'' she writes. ``F. put the bloody sliver on my
tongue as if it were a communion wafer, and I swallowed it.'' Do
you know where (begin itals) your (end itals) 13-year-old daughter
is? This aptly titled memoir does offer interesting glimpses into
the struggle behind ballet's pageantry, but at its core is
Zimroth's disturbing relationship with F., which does not deserve
the camouflage of the master-pupil bond. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC: EYEWITNESS TO THE 20TH CENTURY &QL; 
 &UR; (National Geographic Society, $40)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Of all the big books that look back over the closing century _ they
include Harold Evans' ``The American Century'' and newsman Peter
Jennings' ``The Century'' _ this is the most specific and the best
bargain. Its editors take us through the years from 1901 to 1998
(nothing will happen in 1999, it seems). Each year includes its own
timeline and capsules on news events, and each decade is introduced
with an essay by a noted historian and several pages on ``National
Geographic'' itself, the stories it published, how technology
changed the look of the magazine and its involvement with its
readers and its subjects. In 1935, for instance, the National
Geographic Society co-sponsored the flight of the balloon Explorer
II, which set an altitude record of nearly 14 miles while its crew
measured cosmic rays, studied the effects of altitude on fungus
spores carried from the ground, and took photographs that showed
the curvature of the earth. In May 1936, ``Geographic'' carried the
results of these scientific experiments, along with a notice that
Society members could write in and receive free bookmarks made of
cloth from ``Explorer II.'' This book is fun reading, and for
``National Geographic,'' uncharacteristically text-driven _ the
photographs are small and, for once, take second billing. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE GUINNESS BOOK OF RECORDS 1999 &QL; 
 &UR; (Guinness Media, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Here is what we learned from this book: Joni Mabe of Athens,
Ga., owns one of Elvis Presley's warts as part of her collection of
Elvis memorabilia. The most-mentioned woman on the Internet is
Pamela Anderson. Blood-sucking hookworms inhabit 700 million people
worldwide and are probably responsible for a daily blood loss of
12.3 million pints (or an amount equal to the blood of more than a
million people). Elaine Esposito of Torpon Springs, Fla., went into
a coma at age 6 after an appendectomy, and died on Aug. 6, 1941,
having been comatose for 37 years and 111 days. Stephen King is
worth $84 million. The fattest cat alive weighs 36 pounds and has a
14-inch neck. Frenchman Michel Lotito eats metal _ since 1966 his
diet has included 18 bicycles, 15 supermarket carts, seven
television sets, six chandeliers, two beds, a pair of skis, a
Cessna light aircraft, a computer and a coffin. Folks, this
record-breaking business can be a depressing thing. ``Guinness''
has put it all under one roof for you, with flashy pages and the
air of the freak show in every turn. &QL;

MAYOR URGES STRONG ACTION AGAINST PIE THROWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MACKENZIE WARREN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown urged a court jury to make an
example of three defendants accused of creaming him with pies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would want to see the law applied to the people involved ...
particularly (since) violence is involved,'' Brown told the
Superior Court Wednesday as he testified in the trial of three
people charged with misdemeanor battery and assault of a public
official.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was hit by three pies Nov. 7 while he was promoting a
citywide clean-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was frightened,'' he said. ``I saw something coming at me,
something fairly huge. It felt like something falling from the
ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown described what followed as ``total pandemonium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an assault on my person by three people, not one, in a
cowardly manner, with the intention of doing injury to my face and
my eyes,'' he said. ``That's what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerard Livernois, 34, and Rahula Janowski, 27, both of San
Francisco, and Justin Gross, 27, of Berkeley, are charged in
connection with the attack. They pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement Wednesday morning, defense lawyer Mark
Vermeulen told the jury that the defendants had been using
``pieing'' as a platform for their protests of Brown's policies on
homeless people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to put in motion something on the political
agenda,'' Vermeulen said. ``The purpose was to change the course of
policy on homeless crimes through media attention and discussions
afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said the three defendants were members of the Biotic
Baking Brigade, a group that tries to draw attention to social
issues by throwing pies at prominent figures.
</P>
<P>
   During testimony, Vermeulen said the three had used desserts,
not guns or knives.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown said during a court recess that the defendants were
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you physically assault someone with anything _ a gun, a
knife, baseball bat or whatever _ it has to be dealt with as an
assault, not a political act.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the others hit by pie-throwing groups in San Francisco:
Nobel-winning economist Milton Friedman; Carl Pope, executive
director of the Sierra Club; and San Francisco Supervisor Gavin
Newsom.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Sleeping around will keep you up
nights
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to be president of the United States _ or, for
that matter, a member of the House or Senate _ to know that messing
around with women can mess you up. I've seen it up close myself.
</P>
<P>
   A buddy of mine, who lived in the big city, suffered from a
terrible case of short-term memory loss. What it was, he was always
forgetting he was married.
</P>
<P>
   On one particular occasion when I was there for a visit, we had
arranged to meet at a friendly gathering spot where barbecue in the
finest Texas tradition was served, along with influential
beverages, ice cold and on tap.
</P>
<P>
   Tables were available outside under the trees and not far from a
lazy little stream. There was no better spot, come summer, to sit
and socialize, to eat hearty, to talk big and to drink responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   What more could any man want?
</P>
<P>
   My buddy, as always, sought female companionship.
</P>
<P>
   So it was he had invited his doxy du jour to meet us there,
though not without some trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   Even in early evening it was still broad daylight. Other
friends, who were also friends of his wife, might be on the
premises as well.
</P>
<P>
   Constant vigilance, indeed, is the price of the life of the
libertine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, if anybody shows up who knows me,'' he said, looking
over one shoulder and then another, ``she's with you, not me,
understand?''
</P>
<P>
   I shrugged and nodded. It didn't worry me. A man who doesn't
sleep around always sleeps well.
</P>
<P>
   About that time his friend arrived to join our party. I had to
admit she was attractive enough. But enough for what? To risk
ruining your marriage? Doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   But who am I to say what's right or wrong? I just write down
what people say and put it in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour or so, she said she had to leave, rising from the
table and, in the process, giving him a quick glance with a raised
eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, uh, yeah,'' he mumbled, getting up, too. ``Let me walk you
to your car.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed more nervous than ever, and for good reason. The
restaurant was filling up. No telling who might happen to be there
to tell on him.
</P>
<P>
   My friend was gone maybe 10 minutes, just long enough to get her
to the parking lot and return. But judging from the look on his
face, he'd been to hell and back.
</P>
<P>
   He collapsed in a chair and, without a word, grabbed up a glass
and downed it. His face was ashen, his hands trembling. He sat
there for a long moment staring at the table before he finally
found his voice.
</P>

   ``I'm getting too old for this,'' he gasped. ``I gotta quit it
before it kills me.''
</P>
<P>
   Before I could ask what happened, he was telling me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gotta walk her to her car. She expects it. But what's that
gonna get me, except caught?
</P>
<P>
   ``And then when she's getting in her car, I gotta give her a
little kiss. She expects that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big romantic moment. Hah! I'm kissing with my eyes wide open,
looking every which way, worried that somebody's seeing us.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last she finally drives off. I'm waving goodbye and sighing
a deep sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I turn around _ and not 10 feet away, there's my wife's
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought is: I'm dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``My second thought is: No, I'm in my wife's car.''
</P>
<P>
   He took another long pull on the glass and quickly refilled it.
It was going to be another long, sleepless night.

JOSE MOST POPULAR BOY'S NAME IN TEXAS

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ It's not Joseph or Joe or even Joey. No,
the most popular boy's name in Texas is Jose.
</P>
<P>
   In California, too, Jose tops the list. As the most popular
boy's name on birth certificates in Texas and California in 1998,
it is the first time ever that a Latino name has been No. 1. The
dethroned are Daniel in California and Christopher in Texas, which
slipped to No. 3 behind Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by high birth rates and steady immigration, Latinos are
expected to overtake African-Americans as the nation's largest
minority group by early next century.
</P>
<P>
   But the popularity of the name Jose may mean more than
demographic change, most of which can be traced to Mexico. Latinos
who name their children Jose are choosing not to name them Joe,
some experts say, suggesting a cultural affirmation. In past
decades, there seemed to be more pressure to assimilate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite clearly, in much of Latino society the feeling is that
the culture is established,'' said Edward Callary, professor of
English at Northern Illinois University and editor of the journal
of the American Name Society.
</P>
<P>
   One of San Antonio's newest Joses is Jose Loera, all 6 pounds, 7
ounces of him. Born to Mexican parents at Santa Rosa Hospital on
Jan. 10 about a month early, Jose was dealt his father's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Mexican,'' said his mother, Maria Loera, who named her
other sons Martin and Pablo. ``And for me, it's better to have a
Jose than a Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   The name Jose gets its popularity primarily from Catholic
iconography, St. Joseph, and Joseph, husband of Mary in the Bible,
which explains its prominence among people of Latin-American
descent.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, perhaps, no Maria can be found on either the Texas or
California top 10, nor can any other Latino girls' names. In Texas,
the No. 1 girl's name is Ashley. In California, it's Jessica. Nor
are there any other Latino names on the top 10 list of names for
boys in either Texas or California.
</P>
<P>
   On the national level, no Latino name has yet to break the top
10. There, Michael holds sway for the boys, as it has for 35 years,
according to the San Francisco-based BabyCenter, an Internet site
that compiles such lists. Kaitlyn is No. 1 for girls, according to
data released by the Social Security Administration
</P>
<P>
   But ethnic names can be found on the list, such as Anthony and
Jacob, suggesting that over time immigrant names become American
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps, says Cecilia Munoz, vice president of policy for the
National Council for la Raza, a Washington-D.C. based Latino
advocacy group, the country is simply more comfortable with names
that are not your average Tom, Dick and Harry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The popularity of the name Jose may mean we're not as shy
about names that are distinct,'' Munoz said. ``But it certainly
reflects what we all know. The Latino community is growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to the anti-immigration feelings that have in part
defined the politics of the 1990s, Munoz fears a backlash against
the popularity of the name Jose. She recalled that presidential
contender Pat Buchanan used the name himself in his 1996
anti-illegal immigration pitch, promising to turn back ``Jose'' at
the border.
</P>
<P>
   While the name game clearly says something about who we are as a
society, and who we are becoming, not everyone agrees that the
latest rankings should be used as social-science data.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cultural statement,'' said Rodolfo de la Garza, vice
president of the University of Texas' Tomas Rivera Center, a Latino
issues think-tank. ``But it may or may not be associated with
assimilation.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Garza says there are too many variables to know. Even if
giving a child a Latino name is illustrative of assimilation, he
says, it's not entirely clear where the cultural affinity lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the thinking is, `I'm so American I can call my kid
Jose,''' said de la Garza. ``Or maybe it's, `I'm so Latino.'''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's both.
</P>
<P>
   Loera, the Mexican mom who just gave birth to Jose, named her
daughter Jackie, even though she favors Latino names for her sons.
Enriqueta Rabago, a San Antonio woman of Mexican descent, has two
sons, one Roberto and the other Patrick.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, Rabago suggested as she walked through San Antonio's
downtown bus station this week, the names reflect her binational
family. She is a U.S. citizen and her husband Mexican. Even so,
Patrick sounds more Irish than American. Call it the melting pot.
</P>
<P>
   While the popularity of Jose soars, other, more complicated
Latino names are long forgotten, de la Garza says. How about the
traditional Mexican name Agapito? Or Moctezuma? De la Garza says
these names are dying out among newcomers, and predicts that Jose
may too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name Jose has more in common with less educated Mexicans
who are looking for something traditional,'' said de la Garza. ``In
seven years, Jose will probably be Joey.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nancy Salinas, who serves barbecue at a downtown San
Antonio restaurant, has a 2-year old boy named Jose Felipe. A San
Antonian of several generations, she calls him Jose. What do his
aunts and uncles call him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Joey,'' she said.

   EXCLUSIVE-CUBA-REBELS (Guatemala) _ When terrorist bombs began
to explode in 1997 amid the tight security of Fidel Castro's Cuba,
speculation about the bombers' identity was rampant: Coup-minded
military officers, some Cuban exiles insisted, or perhaps
right-wing infiltrators from Miami. But the story of the accused
saboteurs, assembled from interviews with the five men in a Havana
prison and the accounts of their relatives, associates and others
in Central America, suggests that even as radical Cuban exiles
mounted their most intense campaign of violence in years against
the Communist government, their operations were less

REFINEMENT AND STATUS IN AMERICANA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The current adage that ``the best always sells'' will
be tested this week at Americana sales when Sotheby's and
Christie's offer a few antiques with the three prerequisites:
rarity, condition and provenance.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Christie's is selling a magnificent Philadelphia
Chippendale tilt-top tea table, circa 1760-70, in the auction of
the collection of Mr. and Mrs. James L. Britton. Expected to go for
$500,000 to $800,000, the table, which appears to be in fine
condition, has a round scalloped top, known as a pie crust, with a
rim divided into 10 curving segments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were few 10-scallop tables ever made,'' said John Hays,
the head of Christie's American furniture department. ``Only a few
craftsmen were capable of this excellence of design and carving.
These tables were the ultimate challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The top is made from one piece of finely grained mahogany, 35
inches in diameter. To achieve equally spaced scallops along the
perimeter, the carver had to divide the piece into 10 even
sections, then carve each edge with alternating straight lines and
ogee curves until he met the spot where he started. One false
thrust of the chisel, and it's over. It's a bit like hemming a
skirt with identical stitches, but a lot more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The top rests on a birdcage mechanism that allows it to be
turned and tilted on its side, for an even showier display. The
column pedestal has carved fluting on the top part of the baluster;
a ball carved with foliage in the center, and a three-legged base.
Each cabriole leg has delicate ankles and an acanthus motif carved
on the bend of the knee. The feet are in the ball-and-claw style.
</P>
<P>
   ``While many of these elements were standard, their integration
here is exceptional,'' Hays said.
</P>
<P>
   He has not given the table an attribution, although he said it
compared favorably with work by the so-called David Deshler carver,
a craftsman who made a set of chairs for David Deshler, a
Philadelphia merchant (1711-92). Hays said he was confident the
table was made by a trained immigrant carver.
</P>
<P>
   One indication of the table's rarity is that there is not one
scallop-top Philadelphia Chippendale tea table in Albert Sack's
book ``The Fine Points of Early American Furniture: Good Better
Best Superior and Masterpiece'' (Crown, 1993).
</P>
<P>
   Sack showed only one example of a ``superior'' Chippendale
mahogany tea table from Philadelphia of that period, and it has a
plain round top.
</P>
<P>
   In the Christie's catalog, however, there are photographs of
three other Philadelphia Chippendale scallop-top tables that
Christie's has auctioned since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Hays said that Britton, a Houston entrepreneur, ``was one of the
first collectors of important American furniture who became a
public buyer at auction, so there is a public record of his
things.'' Hays added, ``He bought 10 lots from the Lindens sale in
1983, and paid $308,000 for a great Philadelphia chest in 1985, at
Sotheby's Langdon sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Hays recalled the Britton criteria: ``He would ask me: `Is it
right? Does it look good? And will Marion let me bring it home?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Britton's tea table also has a golden provenance. It belonged to
generations of the Eyre family, which settled in Philadelphia in
1727, and remained in the family from 1770 until Christie's sold it
to Britton on Jan. 26, 1985.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, according to The Boulay 300, a new magazine, it
sold for $286,000, a price that was then a record for a
Philadelphia pie-crust table. That record was broken the following
year, in 1986, when a New Hampshire businessman, Eddy G. Nicholson,
bought another Philadelphia pie-crust tea table at auction for $1.1
million. It was sold in 1995 for $2.4 million, the current record
price.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, there is a lot of interest in Saturday's sale.
</P>
<P>
   Tea tables originated with the establishment of the English tea
trade with the Orient in the 17th century. Tilt-top tables were
made solely to serve precious tea and were stored until the next
tea party. They were status symbols.
</P>
<P>
   In the American Colonies, long before the Revolution, the
citizens of cities like Philadelphia divided themselves into two
groups: refined society and the rest of the world. There were rule
books for polite conversation and social intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans faithfully copied, republished and read courtesy
books,'' Richard L. Bushman wrote in his book ``The Refinement of
America'' (Vintage Books, 1993). ``More important, they built
houses with spaces where the life of the courtesy-book world could
be carried forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of genteel society had parlors to show off their tea
services and refined furnishings, and their tea parties were an
important part of their social life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Invitations for tea parties insured that only designated
guests would attend,'' Bushman wrote. ``Many such invitation cards
to 18th-century teas have survived two centuries, some indication
of their value to recipients.''
</P>
<P>
   Examples of refined furnishings will also be auctioned at
Sotheby's Americana sales, to be held Friday through Sunday. The
piece generating the most attention is a spectacular Newport
secretary bookcase of about 1745. Done in the Queen Anne style, it
is signed by Christopher Townsend, the patriarch of the pre-eminent
Newport cabinetmaking dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   It has solid silver locks, lopers (pull-out supports for a
slant-front desk top) and drawer pulls initialed by Samuel Casey,
an accomplished silversmith.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary is brand new to the market because it has been in
France in the house of a family related to the American Consul to
Calais, who originally shipped it there about 1795, said Leslie
Keno of Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This piece forces us to redefine the way we look at early
18th-century American furniture,'' Keno said. ``It is the only
piece of American furniture with silver hardware, and it's
extremely rare to have a secretary with a dome top and
bracket-and-ball feet. It's put together with the precision of a
Faberge clock.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary is made, inside and out, of plum pudding mahogany,
which was prized and very expensive. Normally, craftsmen would use
such wood only on the front, where it shows.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Moses, author of ``Master Craftsmen of Newport'' (MMI
Americana Press, 1984), has examined the desk and said he thought
it had been commissioned by a very rich person who specified plum
pudding mahogany throughout the piece, rather than risk shrinkage
or cracking by using secondary woods along with the mahogany.
</P>
<P>
   Moses also noted: ``It's nine feet high. In the 1740s, only one
of a hundred houses in Newport had ceilings high enough for this
piece.''
</P>
<P>
   The piece also has that all-important provenance; it descends
directly to the present owners from the Rev. Nathaniel Appleton of
Cambridge, Mass., who owned it in the late 1700s. Keno said it had
taken six years to persuade the owners to sell it. The estimate is
$500,000 to $800,000.

THE REBIRTH OF A RENAISSANCE PAINTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The way Christie's told the story, about a decade ago
a man arrived out of the blue at the door of the auction house with
a painting strapped to his car. The picture was dirty and had a few
holes in it. He wanted to know what it was worth. Experts
identified the painter as Dosso Dossi (1486?-1542), a contemporary
of Titian and Raphael, from Ferrara, in northern Italy, and when
the work went on the block, the J. Paul Getty Museum paid $4
million for it.
</P>
<P>
   The story raised a few eyebrows in Old Master circles, skeptics
naturally wondering about a mystery collector who lashed
Renaissance art to his luggage rack (supposedly that's where the
holes came from). The sale didn't attract much attention because
Dosso is not a household name. The culture of fame excludes many
worthy artists. Dosso has a status that one might say is equivalent
to Lorenzo Lotto's before the Lotto show at the National Gallery of
Art in Washington last year. That turned out to be one of the best
Old Master shows in a while. If you saw it, you probably will never
forget who Lotto was.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that the Dosso Dossi show at the Met will make at
least the same impact. It's a beautiful exhibition, a gem, smartly
presented _ one of those shows that leaves you feeling as if you've
stumbled on a discovery. Compared with Lotto, Dosso is a more
delightful artist, meaning he is less psychological and probing
when it comes to depicting a specific character (which is why, with
a couple of exceptions, he's not as good at portraiture), but he's
more playful and entertaining, he's a buoyant colorist, and what's
especially remarkable are his landscapes. The Met's ``Three Ages of
Man'' early in the exhibition, for example, is pure joy: a bucolic
dreamscape of pillowy trees in a velvet field fronting the sea.
``Brightness falls from the air,'' a line from a poem by Thomas
Nashe, comes to mind. Dosso had a perfect sense of the ineffable in
nature.
</P>
<P>
   That said, he is also a painter of a certain indecipherable
sophistication that has to do with his having been, throughout his
working life, at the famous Este court in Ferrara. His pictures are
often allegories whose specific meanings may have been known at
court but are lost to us _ if, that is, they ever were specific,
because Dosso may also have been intentionally vague. We know he
improvised on canvas; you can see the evidence in X-rays. You might
say that his art, at least as it looks to us now, has a quality
akin to poetics, meaning not that his paintings illustrate poems or
lines of poetry but that they emulate the character of verse:
they're evocative and allusive without being explicit.
</P>
<P>
   So we are dealing, in other words, with a Renaissance painter of
paradoxical traits, an artist of obvious pleasures and not so
obvious meanings, for which reason it probably helps to know a
little something about the Este court when you see the show.
</P>
<P>
   The show, in fact, is really almost as much about Dosso's milieu
as it is about him, with a long essay in the catalog by Andrea
Bayer, who organized the exhibition at the Met, describing the
court in detail. Alfonso d'Este, she reminds us, commissioned
Titian and Bellini and tried to hire Michelangelo and Raphael.
Ludovico Ariosto, who wrote the greatest epic poem of the 16th
century, ``Orlando Furioso,'' was his court poet.
</P>
<P>
   As Alfonso's court painter, Dosso was therefore in a prime
position to know the best art of the day. He absorbed what was
going on in Rome and Venice and to the north in Germany, so that
his work, over time, took into account Giorgione, Titian, Raphael,
Michelangelo, Giulio Romano, Durer, even a visionary painter like
Altdorfer. You can clearly see, from gallery to gallery, how his
style changes and solidifies under the pressure of different
influences.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition caused a small brouhaha when it opened in Italy
last year because two of the principal authors of the catalog,
Peter Humfrey and Mauro Lucco, inspired by newly found documents,
redated a fair number of Dosso's paintings, the upshot of their
arguments being that Dosso was quicker to assimilate the lessons of
Titian and Raphael than previously believed. They made a case for
his having been, as it were, more on the cutting edge of early
16th-century art than scholars had thought.
</P>
<P>
   We may leave the dates to the experts. The relevance of the
argument for the rest of us is what even a casual viewer sees of
Dosso in the exhibition: the sort of lively mind that we associate
not with a derivative painter but with an artist of originality.
Put differently, we see that Dosso, though he was obviously never
on a par with Titian, became a painter of distinction because at
the Este court he was attuned to, while still being apart from,
gravitational centers like Rome and Venice.
</P>
<P>
   He was a funny painter. We're actually meant to laugh at some of
his pictures. Because we take Renaissance painting so seriously, we
forget that Renaissance painters could have a sense of humor. At
the Este court I imagine it would have been virtually required: no
one there was supposed to appear to be trying too hard or taking
himself too seriously, not even the duke.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, Dosso's ``Allegory of Hercules,'' one of the oddest
pictures in the show, in which Hercules is an old man dithering
with toys. Hercules being generally associated with Duke Ercole,
Alfonso's son, the work would seem to be an outrageous joke at its
patron's expense. You can't quite imagine, say, Raphael, making fun
of the pope. But Rome was not Ferrara, where the Este court clearly
embraced parody. Or call it high-flown low-brow comedy.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps to explain an even stranger group of paintings of
big male nudes by Dosso, his ``Learned Men of Classical
Antiquity,'' which must be parodies too, this time of Michelangelo.
There's no other reasonable explanation for their dumpy appearance
in light of works like ``Jupiter, Mercury and Virtue,'' which makes
clear that for the right occasion Dosso obviously could paint
heroic male nudes exquisitely. He may never have been a truly
sublime or even a consistent technician, but he was more than adept
when he chose to be.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the picture the Getty bought 10 years ago (and
gorgeously restored), ``Allegory of Fortune,'' is, in its stony
formality, another tour de force of fantasist pyrotechnics, robust
muscularity and vibrant details, with an especially beautiful still
life: a verdant set piece of heightened realism reflecting, as do
his landscapes, his love of nature.
</P>
<P>
   I recommend paying special attention to a few, less obvious
pictures in the show. His ``Sibyl'' is a liquid portrait of
evanescent emotion, a romantic image of a star-gazing prophet, with
highly refined touches _ the gold ribbons in her hair, the silky
gold gown _ that against a dark backdrop read like sparklers at
night. ``St. George'' strikes a graver note, and is nearly as
memorable as a single-figure study of intense yet indefinite
feeling, with much of the expressive weight carried by subtle
gradations of transfiguring color.
</P>
<P>
   I love Dosso's early, Giorgionesque paintings, not just ``St.
George'' or his most famous picture, ``Circe,'' from the Borghese
in Rome, but also works like ``Buffoon.'' They're moody visions of
soft hues and inverted light, full of mysterious figures and
events. Even a menacing subject like the ``Nymph and Satyr'' has a
kind of enchanted languor, a sense of dream time.
</P>
<P>
   But I suppose the last room of the show is the exhibition's
climax. If Dosso's style stiffens in later years, it also stretches
out. Sometimes in these pictures, he collaborated with his brother,
Battista, and a few of the works in the final room are entirely by
Battista. Among them, ``Night,'' a Boschian fantasy of wild animals
and gnomes, is amazing, though mostly Battista, a more perfunctory
painter, lacked Dosso's breadth and scale of imagination. When they
teamed up on ``Hercules and the Pygmies,'' one of the wildest
pictures before Blake, it made perfect sense that Dosso painted
Hercules and Battista painted the Pygmies.
</P>
<P>
   Dosso's Hercules is a suave and effete hero, vaguely effeminate,
absent-mindedly gathering up the Pygmies in his lion skin. His head
is probably an idealized portrait of Duke Ercole, and the picture
is, no doubt, an allegory about those who might challenge the
Duke's authority.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of Dosso, a weighty message is conveyed wittily and
obliquely, with a poet's touch.

   IMPEACH-MCCARTY _ It's official: Larry Flynt isn't just your
hometown smut peddler any more. He's a folk hero for the First
Amendment; no, he's an elder statesman and king un-maker; no, he's
a member of the ``new media,'' as Newsweek christened him this
week. Whew. Makes you nostalgic for the days he was hawking
Bachelor Beat on the streets of downtown Dayton, for a dime an
issue. Now he's forking over millions for Congressional sleaze.
There are few things more enjoyable than watching other people's
hypocrisy being exposed. Some are even arguing that Flynt is the
cure for all of our political ills, a sign that things have sunk so
low they can only get better. But Larry Flynt isn't the cure for
what ails Washington. He's one of its most revolting symptoms. And
those of us who are troubled by the process that brought us to
Clinton's impeachment _ by all the book deals, nose jobs, modeling

`TURBULENT SOULS': WORDS UPON THE HEART, HEARD AT LAST
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes at end) 
(DW) 
 By JULIE SALAMON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of Stephen J. Dubner's many brothers and sisters fell away
from their parents' Catholicism the usual way. They simply let it
lapse. Stephen, the youngest, took it on himself to carry on the
family tradition, and that's what he did, though not the way his
mother had planned. Instead of becoming a priest, as she had hoped,
he decided to become a Jew, much as his parents, both originally
Jews from Brooklyn, had rejected their parents' religion and found
a faith of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Why did his parents convert to Catholicism? Why did he
``revert'' (his mother's terminology) to Judaism? Once Dubner began
asking these questions, he couldn't ignore their attendant
reverberations: psychological, spiritual, familial.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as a journalist, he addressed the conundrum of his
theologically entangled family by writing about it for The New York
Times Magazine, where he was a staff writer and editor. This highly
public inquiry, which appeared in 1996, first deepened the rift
between him and his mother but then led to a reconciliation
mediated by the Archbishop of New York, Cardinal John O'Connor, and
finally to the publication of Dubner's tenderly provocative memoir,
``Turbulent Souls: A Catholic Son's Return to His Jewish Family.''
</P>
<P>
   As the best family stories do, this one resonates beyond the
Dubners' kitchen table. The tales of estrangement and
reconciliation are familiar (``half `Jazz Singer,' half `Fiddler on
the Roof,''' Dubner writes ruefully). But the book's distinctive
poignancy springs from the soul searching of Dubner and his parents
that instigated the estrangements and reconciliations.
</P>
<P>
   His mother grew up as Florence Greenglass, the dreamy daughter
of irreligious Jews. She envied the Catholic children in the
neighborhood with their rosaries, their confessions and especially
their belief in the afterlife. But her immediate interest as a
teen-ager was ballet. She began to study with Madame Souvorina, a
refugee from czarist Russia. The charismatic Madame introduced the
impressionable Florence not only to dance but to vegetarianism and
to Jesus as well.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Sol Dubner, also from Brooklyn but from an Orthodox
Jewish home, became an Army medic stationed, portentously, on
Christmas Island, a remote Pacific outpost. The only Jew there, he
spent much time helping the Maryknoll nuns who ran an orphanage
there. In letters home, many written in Yiddish, he said he was
reading incessantly, but failed to mention what he was reading. He
taught himself Latin to understand the Mass; he memorized the
Gospel, he read ``Apologia pro Vita Sua,'' a firsthand conversion
account by John Cardinal Newman, the 19th-century Anglican vicar
who became a Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   When Sol returned to New York, he found Florence, perhaps
inevitably, at a meeting of young Catholic activists. They married,
reinventing themselves as Veronica and Paul (``in honor of the
quintessential convert''). Their romance with each other and with
the church would remain a powerful package, inextricably bound.
</P>
<P>
   They firmly shut the door to their past; not a single blood
relation came to their wedding. Sol had already been excommunicated
by his Orthodox father according to a ``Fiddler''-like script:
``You are not a Jew anymore, and you are not my son anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   So it wasn't easy for Stephen to find his Jewish family. Though
his father sang ``My Yiddishe Momme'' and offered his Catholic
children gefilte fish, he died when Stephen was only 10. So many
questions were left unanswered: ``Did he feel no pang of dissonance
as Yom Kippur approached each year? Did he never hear in his memory
the cry of the cantor from his father's synagogue? Did he not think
of his father at all?''
</P>
<P>
   As for Stephen's mother, she remained vividly present and
unrelentingly Catholic. ``For her, Catholicism was Truth, and
beyond that was mere history.'' For her son, ``mere history,''
particularly the timing of his parents' leaps of faith, would
become a monumental source of angst. He wanted to ask his mother
(but restrained himself), ``Are you trying to tell me that you're a
Jew in the middle of World War II and you decide to become a
Catholic and it has  &UR; nothing  &LR; to do with what's happening to the
Jews in Europe?''
</P>
<P>
   Instead he asked her how the Holocaust had affected her. She
told him about Edith Stein, the Jew in Poland who converted to
Catholicism, became a nun and was taken to Auschwitz by the Nazis.
``She was martyred there,'' explained Mrs. Dubner.
</P>
<P>
   Her exasperated son replied, ``But what about  &UR; you? &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't affect our family because we didn't have anyone
there,'' was her response.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to find satisfaction from his mother, Dubner set out on
his ``family reclamation project.'' He traveled to Poland to
dispute his mother's assertion that ``we didn't have anyone
there.'' He helped edit a collection of the teachings of Rabbi
Menachem Mendel Schneerson, believed by many of his Hasidic
followers to be the Messiah. He opened the door his parents had
shut and found a family tree that ``had begun with 10 Catholics,
had grown to include more than 600 Jews, living and dead, over five
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   He began to internalize centuries of hostility between Catholics
and Jews: ``The more vigorously I embraced Judaism, the more
vigorously I was inclined to assault Catholicism _ and my
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   But like many a Jewish son before him, he couldn't separate from
his mother. He wanted her approval. He presented his problem to
Cardinal O'Connor, who artfully contrived a theological olive
branch: ``Tell your mother that you have tried to study this, that
you have prayed about it, this is not just a revolt or a rejection,
this is not a dismissal of what you don't understand _ that this is
where you think God wants you to be, an informed Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother and son make an agreement to disagree. In this vibrant,
affecting memoir, Dubner makes this rapprochement between a
Catholic convert and a reverted Jew seem like a revelation.

CLINTON TOUTS SUCCESS OF ANTI-CRIME INITIATIVES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On a day House prosecutors presented their case of
high crimes and misdemeanors against him, President Clinton
surrounded himself Thursday with police officers and Justice
Department officials to tout the success of his anti-crime
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Without any sense of irony, the White House pressed ahead with
the president's routine even if the day, like so many others of
late, was anything but routine.
</P>
<P>
   An aide said Clinton had no intention of watching the televised
proceedings of the Senate trial, only the second against a
president in the nation's history, as House members outlined why
they believed the president should be removed from office on
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   As the House prosecution team opened its case, the president was
midway through a senior staff meeting on his upcoming State of the
Union address. Clinton intends to give the speech Tuesday, the same
day that his defense team opens its case before the 100 Senate
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   He kept his weekly luncheon date with Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, Clinton met with his economic policy aides to
discuss Social Security reform and then flew to New York City where
he attended an evening reception for Jesse Jackson's Wall Street
Project, a program aimed an encouraging more minority hiring among
Wall Street firms.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent the night there and planned another Wall Street
Project event Friday before returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The president began his day in nearby Alexandria, Va., where he
met with police officers and police chiefs who support his
community policing program. Also accompanying Clinton were
Democratic Sens. Joseph Biden of Delaware and Charles Robb of
Virginia, who hours later would be sitting at their desks listening
to the House's opening arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The event was timed with the release of a Justice Department
Bureau of Justice Statistics midyear report showing the number of
violent crimes reported in 1998 fell below 3 million for the first
time since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno also spoke at the event, noting the
decreasing crime rate and crediting Clinton with the downward
trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have worked so hard to make sure that communities across
America have the tools, the resources, the technology, but most of
all, the dedicated and caring people necessary to fight and to
prevent crime. No one has done more than you, and it has been
magnificent to watch it unfold in these six years,'' Reno said to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The president used the forum to announce an expansion of his
1994 program that initially called for 100,000 community police
officers by the year 2000. The remaining 8,000 officers needed to
meet the goal should be hired soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, continuing to unveil budget proposals, announced a $1.3
billion proposal for 2000 _ and $6.4 billion over five years _ to
hire an additional 30,000 to 50,000 officers for the policing
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be the best investment we can make in a safe future for
our children, and I hope we can pass it with your help,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also requested $350 million from Congress for
crime-fighting technology to help police.
</P>
<P>
   But the president never mentioned the trial under way on Capitol
Hill. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's low temperature at Albany, N.Y., was minus 26 degrees
Fahrenheit, a reading representative of the deep chill numbing
northern New York and interior New England.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, ice and snow will develop across much of interior New
England and upstate New York as an increasingly moist flow of air
from the Atlantic clashes with cold air grudgingly retreating over
the interior. In many places, snow will change to sleet and
freezing rain, with the possibility of ice accumulating on trees
and power lines. The changeover will not occur over northern Maine
and northern New Hampshire, where accumulations of snow could be
moderate to heavy. Wintry precipitation will change to rain along
most of the Northeast Coast.

   Farther south, some potent showers and thunderstorms will
produce some moderate to locally heavy rains across the southern
Middle Atlantic and Southeast Seaboards as an active jet stream
disturbance passes overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Areas of fog and patches of drizzle or freezing drizzle will
develop over parts of the northern Plains as moister air moves over
chilly, snow-covered ground. To the south, areas of fog and low
clouds will cover parts of east Texas and Louisiana Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   High winds will buffet parts of the Front Range of the northern
and central Rockies Friday. Meanwhile, moderate to heavy rains will
douse the Pacific Northwest from northwest California to western
Washington as moist Pacific winds work in tandem with jet stream
disturbances. The heaviest rains will occur on west-facing slopes
of the Coastal Range.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Very Big Chill
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures plummeted to minus 55 degrees Fahrenheit early
Thursday at the town of Allagash in northern Maine, smashing the
state's all-time record of minus 48 degrees set at the town of Van
Buren on January 19, 1925. Moreover, the reading represents the
lowest temperature ever observed east of the Mississippi River.
Previously, Wisconsin held this distinction with its state record
of minus 54 degrees. Thursday's rare record chill was produced by
an Arctic high pressure system, whose central barometric pressure
of 31.10 inches of mercury reflected the potential for a very big
chill.  &QL;

SAN FRANCISCO GIRDS FOR YEAR 2000 GLITCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ City officials have been busy reprogramming
computers and upgrading equipment to prepare for the year 2000
computer glitch. They are even considering stockpiling medicine for
public hospitals and fuel for city buses in case the supplies are
cut off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we won't have problems, but we will have
immediate solutions,'' said Julia Friedlander, acting director of
the city Department of Telecommunications and Information Services.
She is directing the preparations for the glitch that may affect
computer systems that operate everything from elevators to police
dispatching systems.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco had already allocated $1 million for the current
fiscal year to plan for tear 2000 glitches and plans to spend
nearly $1 million more to create a project team to provide city
departments with technical assistance in dealing with the problem.
Equipment will be monitored and tested to make sure it is up to
speed and will not crash when the new year rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   Computer specialists fear that many computers originally
programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a year will
fail or malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the machines will assume
it is 1900.
</P>
<P>
   It ``is definitely a real problem,'' Friedlander said. ``What no
one knows is how significant it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The city has spent the past several years, and millions of
dollars, updating older equipment. New equipment purchased must be
year 2000-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Programmers, however, are scrambling to make sure that
everything else that runs with a date-encoded microchip is
rejiggered or replaced. Critical city operations, such as water
distribution and hospital equipment, are getting top priority,
Friedlander said.
</P>
<P>
   The city also is urging vendors, such as the bus system's diesel
fuel suppliers and pharmaceutical companies, to get their act
together. City Controller Ed Harrington said the city may make sure
extra supplies are on hand _ just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Other contingency plans are in the works. City workers, for
example, are being trained to operate automated systems manually
and some departments will beef up staffing and cancel vacations
around the new year.
</P>
<P>
   And Harrington, who is on the Y2K troubleshooting team, already
knows where he will be spending New Year's Eve: in the city's new
emergency operations center. ``Just in case,'' he said.

NEWS AND NOTES FROM THE SILVER SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ There are, of course, movies about people falling in
love. And there are movies about spectacular breakups. The question
Rob Reiner decided to confront was whether an engaging and funny
movie could be made about all the quotidian details that fall in
between.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner is back. In fact, he never went away. But for several
years, he has concentrated in his directing on serious dramas like
``Ghosts of Mississippi'' rather than on the sort of comedies on
which he built his reputation, like ``When Harry Met Sally.''
</P>
<P>
   But now he is making a movie that is, by his own admission,
something of a throwback to that earlier work. It is called ``The
Story of Us,'' and it stars Bruce Willis, making his own return to
comedy after many years in other sorts of films, mainly action. He
plays opposite Michelle Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Story of Us,'' which is scheduled for release in the fall
by Universal, will cost roughly $50 million. It explores the story
of a married couple as they try to decide whether to stay together
after 15 years. In addition to directing the movie, which he also
helped write and produce, Reiner plays one of the couple's best
friends. Rita Wilson is cast as his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the daily ins and outs of a marriage,'' Reiner
said in a telephone interview from one of the sets. ``I don't want
to give away the ending, but they are trying either to make the
marriage work or make the separation work. Our job is to make that
interesting. It explores some of the things I explored in `When
Harry Met Sally.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the new movie, Willis plays a writer (Paul Reiser is his
agent); Ms. Pfeiffer's character designs crossword puzzles. Willis
goes from skepticism that anyone can make a living at such an
activity to examining, later in his marriage, his wife's puzzles
for insights into their relationship and its decidedly murky
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point he says to a friend, `Did you see Sunday's seven
down?''' Reiner said. ``He starts to see her crosswords as secret
messages.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiner said there was much of himself in the movie. He was
married for roughly 10 years, then divorced, and he has been
remarried for about 10 years. He said he was fascinated by the
issue of how a marriage does or does not work.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted he wanted to treat the subject in an amusing
way, even if he had not made that sort of film in a while, and to
do it with an actor who had played very different parts.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner said: ``Why Bruce Willis? When he did his first action
picture, everyone said, `Why Bruce Willis?' This movie goes back to
what he does best, I think, and what he started with. We all want
to do lots of different things.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If there is a serious thought behind the critically acclaimed
romp ``Shakespeare in Love,'' it is that he may have been a genius,
but he was first and foremost a professional writer, facing many of
the same pressures a writer today confronts. Shakespeare, as
imagined in the film, struggles with deadlines, writer's block,
competition in the marketplace, hard-edged money men and fickle
producers.
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise, then, that the originator of the
idea for the film and the co-author of the screenplay is a writer
who had to struggle with deadlines, writer's block, competition,
hard-edged money men and fickle producers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the writer, Marc Norman, tells the story,
``Shakespeare in Love'' took nearly nine years to get to the screen
and was all but dead several times, a seemingly good idea that,
like hundreds of others every year, ran aground on the shoals of
the studio development process. The road to success was paved with
failures. It was, well, Shakespearean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally realized in trying to write about Shakespeare that
he was in the same business I am,'' Norman said. ``That was how I
connected with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman said that the seed for the idea was planted by his son,
Zack. Norman floundered for nearly two years trying to find a way
of writing about Shakespeare before conceiving a tale of a fellow
professional. Tom Stoppard was brought in to work on the script,
and the movie was set up at Universal Studios with Julia Roberts as
the female star and Ed Zwick as the director.
</P>
<P>
   That arrangement fell apart when Ms. Roberts withdrew from the
film, Norman said. The idea was shopped unsuccessfully to other
studios for several years. ``It was seen as damaged goods, and
nobody was interested for like four years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, meanwhile, continued in his usual work as a well-paid
script doctor. ``When you get old enough in this business they
figure you can fix all the mistakes made by the kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He even suffered another extremely complex misfire with
``Cutthroat Island,'' a pirate epic that is reputed to have been
the first movie to lose $100 million. Norman said he first came up
with an idea of a film about a female pirate several years ago and
called it ``Mistress of the Seas.'' It was on, then off, then on
again, then collapsed before it was transformed into ``Cutthroat
Island'' by Carolco Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, ``Shakespeare in Love,'' remained alive.
Miramax spotted it and decided to produce the movie. By that time,
Winona Ryder, Jodie Foster and Meg Ryan had all been mentioned as
possible stars, Norman said. Once Miramax assumed responsibility,
John Madden replaced Zwick as the director; Gwyneth Paltrow was
signed as Viola, the female lead, and Joseph Fiennes became
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the matter of the ending. Norman said the
producers fiddled with a few options before landing on the current
emotional parting. ``It was something he would have understood,''
Norman said, referring to Shakespeare. ``He sort of invented show
business. We live in that same world in some ways.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The whole idea of the remake lost some of its luster in the last
year. A new ``Psycho'' fizzled at the box office, and ``The
Avengers'' barely earned enough to be called a fizzle. But the
studios are not willing to give up on mining the memories of aging
baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   So the question has become: How to do remakes without slipping
into camp or, more important, losing touch with younger audiences?
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by the challenge, the director Stephen Sommers has
tackled what is probably one of the toughest efforts to remake a
classic. He has written and directed a new version of the 1932
melodrama ``The Mummy.'' His strategy: replace the cliche _
menancingly outstretched arms on a dimly lighted figure wrapped in
gauze _ with romance, surprises and laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Universal is preparing to release this new $80 million ``Mummy''
on May 7. That means the film will open just two weeks before the
latest installment in the ``Star Wars'' series, which is expected
to dominate the box office this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy'' has been years in the making and was developed by
a number of directors before Sommers decided to take a crack. He
said he had begun work on the film by effectively tearing up the
original and many of the other treatments and doing what he called
``an interpretation'' of the tale of the cursed Egyptian cadaver
that rises from the dead. Horror has given way to adventure. The
new movie, which stars Brendan Fraser, appears to have more in
common with the Indiana Jones films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went in right up front and said, `This can't be about some
guy in bandages,' '' said Sommers, who wrote and directed ``Rudyard
Kipling's `Jungle Book''' and ``The Adventures of Huck Finn.'' ``I
didn't even want to do a horror movie. I took the concept and made
a romantic adventure film. I like action heroes who don't take
themselves too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which was shot largely in Morocco, takes place in
1925 and follows a group of explorers in the desert. They stumble
on an ancient Egyptian tomb, unwittingly unleash a cursed
3,000-year-old priest and, well, you know the rest.
</P>
<P>
   While the original film relied on shadows, the new one is heavy
on special effects, supplied by George Lucas' Industrial Light and
Magic. Sommers said he worked hard to make Fraser's character, the
adventurer who battles the mummy, an action hero with a sense of
humor, an open heart and a gift for conjuring up surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make everyone take the mummy seriously, but it
couldn't just be a guy in bandages,'' Sommers said. ``But the main
thing was to build in surprises. That's one of the great things you
can do with special effects.''

   Dr. King's Life, For Children &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coretta Scott King said that it was fun to see her children's
names in the credits alongside Samuel Jackson, Susan Sarandon, John
Travolta and Whoopi Goldberg. They and a dozen other stars are the
voices of characters in the video movie ``Our Friend, Martin,''
based on the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., released
by CBS Fox on Tuesday to commemorate the King holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The film is partly a fictional, animated story inspired by
King's life and partly documentary coverage of a few major events
in his career. In the animated portions, Dexter King is the voice
of his father in his 30s; Yolanda King is Martin's sister.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned a class project on King's teachings, several sixth
graders time-travel back to his days as a student in a segregated
high school in Atlanta. They befriend Martin, who is surprised to
see black and white children mix as friends. Subsequent time
travels visit the boycotts and demonstrations in Birmingham, Ala.,
and 1963 march on Washington with its ``I have a dream'' oration.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the present, the children learn Martin will be
assassinated. To save him, they go back to their first meeting with
him and convince him to accompany them into the present, thereby
avoiding the shot fired in Memphis in 1968. But this means that all
that King achieved would never have happened and that society would
be as segregated and bigoted as it ever was. Martin returns to live
out the actuality.
</P>
<P>
   How does Mrs. King (Oprah Winfrey in the film) regard race
relations today? ``I'm always hopeful,'' she said. The family was
approached about a number of film projects, but she favored
animation that would teach children King's way of bringing about
social change. ``The younger generation needs to feel good about
themselves and the nation,'' she said. ``We have to show kids how
they can become empowered.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Frankenheimer Chat &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the many extras packed onto digital video disks are
interviews with filmmakers and, on some DVDs, a reprise of the film
with running commentary by the director on how each scene was made.
On Feb. 23, those features will advance a notch or two with the
release of ``Ronin'' by MGM.
</P>
<P>
   On the disk, John Frankenheimer will describe his film, a
thriller about a gang of thieves trying to recover a briefcase
filled with no one knows what. But then comes a departure. Viewers
will be invited to a guided tour of the movie, so to speak, on the
Internet on March 14 at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the ultimate interactive way to watch a movie. On
the appointed day, view the film on your television set, then plug
the disk into your computer's DVD-ROM. You will be linked to the
site, where Frankenheimer will meet you to discuss the film,
complete with storyboards and behind-the-scenes clips. A 30-minute
chat session follows. You supply the refreshments. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Maybe only a Vincent Gallo character in a Vincent Gallo film
could get away with this. Kidnapping a needy blond kewpie doll
named Layla (Christina Ricci) from her tap-dancing class, the
high-strung Billy Brown ( Gallo, left) wants her to masquerade as
his wife so he can impress his parents (Anjelica Huston and Ben
Gazzara).
</P>
<P>
   Threatening both that he will kill her and that he will not be
her best friend, Billy steers Layla toward the elder Browns'
suburban Buffalo homestead. Eat all you want, he tells her, but
make me look good. Taken with his crazy brio, Layla gradually falls
for Billy in an appealing film that, Janet Maslin wrote in The New
York Times, ``works on its audience in much the same way.'' &QL;

   Slums of Beverly Hills &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The year is 1976 and the colorful Abramowitz family gradually
circles the fringes of Beverly Hills, hopscotching from one
garishly tacky apartment to another (usually just ahead of the rent
collector). It's an expensive town for drifters, but Murray
Abramowitz, a pushy but hard-pressed automobile salesman, wants
good schools for his children, all of whom hate the nomadic life.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially true of the shy Vivian (Natasha Lyonne), who
has to put up with the insufferably overbearing (and quite
hilarious) Murray, her riotous cousin Rita (Marisa Tomei), the
weird but cool boy (Kevin Corrigan) who wants her sexually, and her
two demanding siblings. It's a crazy life, but Tamara Jenkins'
playfully autobiographical film never loses its ``wry air of having
been there and done this''(Maslin). &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Jim Abrahams' Mafia sendup doesn't put a horse's head in a movie
producer's bed, but it does spoof classics of the genre like the
``Godfather'' films and ``Casino'' (at the gaming tables, they're
playing Chutes and Ladders and go fish). Lloyd Bridges is Don
Cortino, the redoubtable patriarch who takes several hundred
machine-gun slugs as if he's dancing the macarena.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Mohr is the Michael Corleone type and Christina Applegate
his waspy fiancee in a film that makes an offer you could probably
refuse but stays ``breezy and reasonably bright'' (Maslin). &QL;

   Randa Haines' film desperately wants to be the ``Saturday Night
Fever'' of salsa. Striving to be the young John Travolta, the
Puerto Rican pop singer Chayanne portrays a young Cuban who moves
to Houston, finds work at a club and falls for a dance instructor
named Ruby (Vanessa Williams). But while Ms. Williams explodes in
an uninhibited performance, Chayanne proves earthbound as a dancer
in a likable mess of a movie film in which ``the big liftoff never

`MARY JANE'S NOT A VIRGIN ANYMORE:' BIBLE-BELT TEENS DISCOVER SEX
</HEADLINE>
 (Editors: production notes at end of review) 
(bl) 
By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every American city has its band of young, self-styled
outsiders. And in the unidentified Bible Belt town that is the
setting for Sarah Jacobson's crude, heartfelt movie ``Mary Jane's
Not a Virgin Anymore,'' they all seem to work in the same seedy
local movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   The modes of teen-age and post-teen-age rebellion on display
aren't especially exotic. Hard drinking, sleeping around, some
bisexuality and cautious body piercing are the chief manifestations
of nonconformism among the staff.
</P>
<P>
   The movie follows the adventures of Mary Jane, a high school
senior from a ``nice'' suburb who takes a part-time job working the
popcorn machine and learns some useful life lessons while hanging
out with this not-so- wild bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Jane (Lisa Gerstein) may come from a protected background, but
when upset she can curse like a truck driver. Much of her venom is
aimed at Steve (Shane Kramer), a leather-jacketed young man who in
the movie's opening scene is shown deflowering her in a cemetery
while she cries out in pain and anger. Her leftover rage is
directed toward Matt (David DeAngelo), an obnoxious, alcoholic,
male chauvinist and self-proclaimed stud whom all the women on the
premises agree is an inept, inconsiderate (and when drunk, which is
most of the time) impotent lover.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is a homemade affair by Ms. Jacobson, who wrote,
directed, edited and produced it. While it has a certain polemical
force, its story feels slapped together and the acting ranges from
the competent to the amateurish.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel that drives ``Mary Jane'' is the film maker's anger at
male sexual selfishness, women's ignorance of their own bodies and
a culture that encourages women to lie about their sexual pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of travels, Jane learns about self-pleasure from a
bisexual co-worker named Ericka (Beth Ramona Allen), who has her
own punk band, and experiences nonpenetrative bliss with Tom (Chris
Enright), the staff's resident dreamboat. Once she feels more
self-confidence, Jane gleefully engineers the awful Steve's
humiliating comeuppance.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gerstein, who bares a striking physical and vocal
resemblance to Kathy Najimy, looks and acts a bit older than 17. In
a movie that translates the sexual gospel according to Dr. Ruth
Westheimer into a kind of punk-rock sermon on sexual etiquette, Ms.
Gerstein gives a blunt, feisty performance.

 EX-UCLA COACH IN LINE TO BE 49ERs EXECUTIVE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Terry Donahue could have a job with the San
Francisco 49ers as general manager if he can't find a job as head
coach somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue, the former football coach at the University of
California at Los Angeles, spoke to the 49ers Wednesday about a
front-office position, according to league sources, who added that
Donahue left the meeting encouraged about his chances of getting
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue, who left UCLA following the 1995 season, is a candidate
for the Chicago Bears head coach and met with that team's officials
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   He will probably not make a decision on a 49ers' job until the
Bears decide what direction they will go. According to sources, the
Bears' job is the one Donahue wants. Last year, Donahue was a
candidate for head coach of the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Interim 49ers executive John McVay could not be reached for
comment, but has more than just one front office hiring to worry
about. As expected, the 49ers have fired Vinny Cerrato, their
director of college scouting, adding to the list of vacancies in
the team's hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Though former head coach Bill Walsh is expected to return to the
team as a temporary evaluator of personnel, the team is expected to
name a president, a vice president of football operations or
general manager, and director of personnel in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg, who does not have a
contract with the 49ers but expects to soon, has turned down the
same job with the Philadelphia Eagles.

WHEN ONLY THE QUARTERBACK IS COOL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (EDS.: Production notes are at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   West Canaan, Texas, the setting of ``Varsity Blues,'' a crisply
directed but entirely predictable all-American morality tale, is a
small town that eats, sleeps and breathes football. For the last 22
years, the Coyotes, the local high school team, have won the
district championship. Those victories have elevated the team's
mean, hard-driving coach Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight) into a legend with
a stadium named after him.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the Coyotes are about to clinch their 23rd regional
championship, the team's star quarterback, Lance Harbor (Paul
Walker), suffers a serious knee injury. Kilmer has no choice but to
call up the second-string quarterback, Jon Moxon (the ``Dawson's
Creek'' star James Van Der Beek), and hope for the best. A serious
student who is waiting to hear whether he will be accepted into
Brown University, Mox, as he is known, is a talented player who,
unlike anybody else in West Canaan (including his own parents),
somehow knows there's more to life than winning at football. And
when he starts dictating strategy during team huddles instead of
letting Kilmer call the shots, the two embark on a collision
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Varsity Blues'' has a paint-by-numbers story that offers no
surprises and a hero and villain etched in white and black with few
shades of gray. Kilmer is a bully and racist who will do anything
to win, including shooting up his players with painkillers when
they are seriously injured and forcing them back onto the field.
The thoughtful, idealistic Mox remains unspoiled even after his
suddenly elevated status turns him into a local god plied with
offers of sex and free beer.
</P>
<P>
   The story may be pure Hollywood formula, but ``Varsity Blues''
gets its digs in at the football fanaticism that grips everyone in
West Canaan except for Mox and his girlfriend, Julie (Amy Smart).
Football is portrayed as more than just a passion; it is organized
mass hysteria that allows a town parched of culture to put on
blinders and imagine that the outside world doesn't exist. The
movie is especially critical of the team members' fathers who have
physically gone to seed but remain emotional adolescents living
vicariously through their sons.
</P>
<P>
   A thread of bawdy high school humor runs through the movie. When
a pretty girl wants to seduce a quarterback, she invites him over
to her house and slithers up to him wearing a bikini made out of
whipped cream. The local high school also happens to have a sex
education teacher (Tonie Perensky) whom the team members discover
working in a topless bar.
</P>
<P>
   On a goofier note, Mox has an 11-year-old brother, Kyle (Joe
Pichler), whose idea of fun is to dress up as Jesus and dash around
the house strapped to a cross. As is pointed out more than once,
Kyle is a highly unlikely candidate to make first string when he
eventually goes to high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Varsity Blues'' is quite well acted, with Voight's understated
portrayal of Kilmer locating a seam of vulnerability under the
facade of a selfish brute. As for Van Der Beek's Mox, he is the
movie's definition of a high school hero, and that means bland. &QL;

A FADING ERA'S BATTLES FOR THE GOOD AND TRUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes are an end of review)  
 (af)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Friday night's hourlong spinoff of Tom Brokaw's best seller,
``The Greatest Generation,'' is a sober celebration of a few of the
men, now in their 70s and 80s, who fought the Germans and Japanese
a half century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the medal winners sought out by Brokaw on visits to the
heartland were wounded or captured, like the airman who was shot
down on his 16th mission and has not eaten a cabbage or a turnip
since his release from the prisoner-of-war camp.
</P>
<P>
   It has been reported that PBS' Jim Lehrer, author of 11 books,
assured Brokaw, ``You know, your great-grandchildren won't see you
on TV, but they'll read this book.'' Whether that is just one
television star with literary aspirations subjecting another to
some friendly flattery may be left to history.
</P>
<P>
   As for the latest NBC documentary, although it does not promise
to keep Brokaw descendants occupied _ not every interview cuts deep
_ hearing of youthful exploits from men now battered by age carries
its own emotional charge.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw is unfailingly admiring, even to the point of cliche:
``His iron will to achieve.'' He reminds us that these heroes of
the 1940s grew up in the 1930s Depression, which may have
influenced their postwar careers as successful businessmen or
community reformers more than their war exploits.
</P>
<P>
   In an extended passage, a father confesses to being disappointed
that his son hasn't turned out to be more like him. The son seems
disappointed in himself.
</P>
<P>
   As he elicits the war stories (from a widow, too) that recall a
heroism without heroics, Brokaw, like his book's title, implies
there has been no passing of the torch. Whether that means these
veterans were truly a special breed or only that they were
challenged in ways, thankfully, that succeeding generations have
been spared, you decide.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most direct answer, from a Congressional Medal of
Honor winner, is that he killed Japanese on Iwo Jima because ``they
were the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   At its best, this earnest tribute to courage, patriotism and
responsibility should go down easily in these sometimes cynical
times, all the more warming for the deeds that changed all of our
lives. &QL;

`AT FIRST SIGHT': PLODDING AND BANAL  
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``At First Sight,'' Virgil Adamson (Val Kilmer) is a blind
man living peacefully in a little Hudson River town. His sister
makes his meals. He's such a terrific masseur that one client
threatens to divorce her husband. He jokes with his beloved
seeing-eye dog and listens happily to sports on television. He
never has to watch slow-paced, stubbornly conventional movies like
this.
</P>
<P>
   Virgil's quiet life changes on the day he begins kneading Amy
Benic (Mira Sorvino), a tense professional type from New York.
Since Amy is on the receiving end of the best movie massage since
Holly Hunter's in ``Living Out Loud,'' she naturally takes notice.
While spending a week at a local spa with daily Virgil sessions
scheduled, Amy develops a major crush, and Virgil reciprocates. See
title to find out what kind of love this is.
</P>
<P>
   Amy and Virgil hit it off so quickly that she doesn't
immediately realize he is sightless. But once she does, empathy
sets in. He makes her understand what rain sounds like, and she
meaningfully describes a pair of trees. (``The trees are kind of
like a man and a woman. The man is asking the woman to dance and
the woman is kind of standing on her toes, deciding if she's got
the guts.'') They touch a lot and skate together sweetly. Everyone
is delighted except for Virgil's sister, Jennie (Kelly McGillis).
She deems Amy her worst nightmare and behaves accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever listened to the rain?,'' Amy asks friends back
in New York. ``I mean, really listened?'' Obviously, thoughts of
Virgil have stayed with her as she resumes her career as a
high-powered architect. (When we first see her loft, an
architectural model is front-row center, just as a reminder.) But
what chance do they really have of building a life together? A
better one, by Amy's reckoning, once she spots a headline reading:
``Experimental Technique Makes Ophthalmology Breakthrough,'' and
another medical miracle from the files of Dr. Oliver Sacks starts
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   It takes about an hour to reach this point in an indulgently
meandering film that could have been pruned at many junctures. (The
New York party scene with guests dancing to ``YMCA'' would have
been a nice place to start.) But as directed by Irwin Winkler, ``At
First Sight'' is determined to dwell on every little step along the
way to restoring Virgil's eyesight, which is an even more crucial
development in this story than the finding of true love.
</P>
<P>
   The pace is so plodding and the dialogue so unwaveringly banal
(``I'm going to bed before we both say things we don't mean'') that
the film can't rise to the extraordinary sensations it means to
capture. For the man on whose real experience the film is based,
recovering his eyesight after near-lifelong blindness was a
powerfully disorienting experience, one that bombarded him with
visual stimuli he had no way to understand. (See title again for
pun on newly restored vision.)
</P>
<P>
   All that the film can do to simulate this is to describe
Virgil's progress with textbook literalness and interject abruptly
blurry images from time to time. The overwhelming strangeness of
his experience is nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Kilmer threatens to disappear behind nice-guy affability at
first, but his performance gets better as matters with Amy get
worse. (``You know, I feel like I saw you better when I was
blind.'') Ms. Sorvino is bright-eyed and sympathetic but makes it
clear that Amy's is the less interesting role. Ms. McGillis, in her
first feature in a long while, plays Virgil's sister with jarring
but intense nervous energy, and Ken Howard briefly plays the
siblings' long-lost father in a subplot that goes nowhere; ditto
for the one in which Steven Weber plays Amy's ever-present ex.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Lane broadly wisecracks his way through the role of
Virgil's vision therapist (``I know, I know, you were expecting
Anne Bancroft''), but can't shake the impression that Robin
Williams was otherwise engaged.
</P>
<P>
   The cameo-acting career of Donald Trump is blown right out of
the water by the mogul Mortimer Zuckerman, who does a
Marie-Antoinette here as a homeless man. He can briefly be found
covered in grime and rags on a New York City street, shouting:
``Hey, what the hell you lookin' at? Get outta here!'' Some joke.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: This film is rated PG-13 (parents strongly cautioned).
It includes mild profanity, partial nudity and sexual situations.

NEWS AND NOTES FROM THE GREAT WHITE WAY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The producers of ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane,''
Martin McDonagh's highly praised Irish drama, said this week that
the play would end its run at the Walter Kerr Theater in mid-March
to make way for ``The Weir,'' another highly praised Irish drama,
by Conor McPherson.
</P>
<P>
   This in itself was no great shock; producers of both shows and
the theater's owner, Jujamcyn Theaters, had been in discussions for
months about a springtime handoff.
</P>
<P>
   But the timing of the announcement had a curious catalyst: a
magazine advertisement. It was also marked by an apparent breakdown
in communications that promises to make for a bumpy transition
between the two shows.
</P>
<P>
   Last week producers of ``Beauty Queen'' learned that next week's
New Yorker magazine would include an advertisement for ``The Weir''
listing both the theater and the date of the show's first preview,
March 23. (A similar ad was posted in Shubert Alley, without the
theater name.)
</P>
<P>
   The date in the New Yorker ad surprised the producers of
``Beauty Queen,'' who had said they were mulling options including
running through April 4, when the only remaining original cast
member, Anna Manahan, is scheduled to leave.
</P>
<P>
   But after learning of the ad, the producers decided to tell the
cast of the earlier-than-expected closing at a pre-show meeting
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Boneau, a spokesman for the show, said in a statement,
``It is with sadness that we are closing `Beauty Queen'
prematurely.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, exactly when the show will close is still up in the air.
Leonard Soloway, one of the ``Beauty Queen'' producers, said
Thursday that regardless of the ``Weir'' ads, his show would run
through March 21. That would make the first planned ``Weir''
preview on March 23 impossible, as the show needs at least a week
to load in its equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Boneau's statement was also careful to highlight the somewhat
poetic nature of the changeover. Last year when ``Beauty Queen''
was looking to transfer to Broadway, Rocco Landesman, the chairman
of Jujamcyn, made the Walter Kerr available by moving ``Forever
Tango'' to the Marquis Theater and paid the $250,000 cost of moving
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is only fair that we now return the favor,'' the statement
read.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Frankel, a producer for ``The Weir'' and ``Forever
Tango,'' also put a collegial spin on changeover. ``We were happy
to move our show `Forever Tango' out of the Kerr so that `Beauty
Queen' could open,'' he said in a statement. ``The circle is now
complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Landesman, meanwhile, said that while the forthcoming ad may
have added ``a sense of urgency,'' to the decision to announce the
closing, if the producers wanted ``Beauty Queen'' to run into
April, Jujamcyn would find it a home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's going to be without a theater,'' he said. ``And if
anybody is going to get a bill for this, it's going to be us.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

   The nominations for the 1999 Olivier Awards, the British
equivalent of the Tonys, are to be announced Friday morning in
London. A peek at the nominees reveals one current Broadway
commodity as well as a preview of coming attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the heap is the National Theater's ballyhooed revival of
``Oklahoma!,'' which received nine nominations, and moves to the
West End this month. It is likely to cross the Atlantic next
season, probably produced by Cameron Mackintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Next in the tally is ``The Blue Room,'' with six nominations,
including nods for its stars, Nicole Kidman and Iain Glen, and a
best new play nomination for David Hare. Other new play nominees
include ``Copenhagen,'' by Michael Frayn; ``The Weir,'' which
grabbed four nominations, and Yasmina Reza's ``Unexpected Man,''
which is expected to land on a New York stage in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Other nominees soon to visit Broadway are Kevin Spacey, a
candidate for best actor in ``The Iceman Cometh,'' and Dame Judi
Dench, who was nominated for best actress in ``Filumena'' but will
next be seen in Hare's ``Amy's View,'' at the Barrymore in April.
</P>
<P>
   A list of nominees will be available on Monday at
www.officiallondontheatre.co.uk. The awards, presented by the
Society of London Theater, will be announced on Feb. 12. &QL;

<P>
   Phylicia Rashad has played an array of strong-worded women, from
her roles in two Bill Cosby television series to her recent turn as
Medea at the Alliance Theater in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Rashad will be taking on another eloquent character,
Zora Neale Hurston, the writer and anthropologist at the center of
``Everybody's Ruby,'' by Thulani Davis. The play, which follows
Hurston's investigation of a 1952 murder in Florida, begins
rehearsals on Tuesday for a March 8 opening at the Joseph Papp
Public Theater.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Rashad, the character and her surroundings ring true.
``I grew up in Houston in the 50s, and I know about that era,'' she
said. ``I know the pace, and the play's got that pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she recently worked with the play's director, Kenny Leon,
in Atlanta, Ms. Rashad said this would be her first appearance at
the Public since 1972, when she was an understudy in James Earl
Jones' version of ``The Cherry Orchard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a little bunny then,'' she said. ``Now I'm a full
grown rabbit.'' &QL;

<P>
   _ As part of the opening weekend of a new musical about Thomas
Jefferson, ``Sally and Tom (The American Way),'' the Castillo
Cultural Center will present a discussion on Sunday featuring two
people who trace their lineage to Jefferson and Sally Hemings, who
was Jefferson's slave and lover.
</P>
<P>
   Shay-Banks Young, Jefferson's
great-great-great-great-granddaughter, and Julia
Jefferson-Westerinen, his great-great-great-granddaughter, will
speak. Information: (212) 941-1234.
</P>
<P>
   _ The gimmick of the week goes to Alan Buchman, the artistic
director of the Salon, the Upper East Side performance space that
is home to ``Prater Violet,'' the stage adaptation of the
Christopher Isherwood novella. Buchman announced that anyone who
buys a ticket will receive a copy of the novella.
``Unautographed,'' he added.

`IN DREAMS': WANT TO SHARE DREAMS? BE CAREFUL; IT'S MURDER
</HEADLINE>
 (editors: production notes at end of review) 
(bl) 
By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At heart ``In Dreams'' is just a campfire story, and a pretty
loony one at that. But Neil Jordan has directed it furiously, with
a lush, insinuating visual style that gets right under the skin.
</P>
<P>
   No stranger to tales of intertwined identities and dark secrets,
Jordan, the director of ``The Crying Game,'' ``Interview With the
Vampire'' and last year's stunning ``Butcher Boy,'' gives his
latest film a feverish intensity that often eclipses its shrill,
groaningly far-fetched side. Working with the audacious
cinematographer Darius Khondji, Jordan stirs up a nightmare
brooding and intuitive enough to recall the richly textured
mysteries of Nicolas Roeg's ``Don't Look Now.''
</P>
<P>
   Plot synopsis will not be kind, but here goes: Claire Cooper
(Annette Bening) is an artist, mother and illustrator plagued by
terrifying psychic visions. Like Denzel Washington in ``Fallen''
(or Faye Dunaway in ``The Eyes of Laura Mars'' or plenty of
others), she is being tormented by somebody else's thoughts. This
time it's a serial murderer of little girls who is doing the
haunting, in a setting that's all too conducive for such spooky
tricks. Claire lives near a New England reservoir that covers the
remains of ``a drowned ghost town.''
</P>
<P>
   (If anything looks familiar, that's because a vast underwater
set was built in the same Mexican tank that housed sunken-ship
scenery for ``Titanic.'')
</P>
<P>
   Nobody takes Claire seriously, not even her husband, an airline
pilot played by Aidan Quinn. Nobody cares when she claims psychic
knowledge about the drowning of one young victim. But then the
Coopers' own daughter is abducted _ out of an ingeniously creepy
grade-school staging of ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,''
performed by night in a forest _ and Claire seems to go berserk.
</P>
<P>
   The film works best when it balances between the external view
of Claire and the Claire who thinks sinister piles of red, red
apples are plotting against her.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Claire was right, of course. In Bruce
Robinson's screenplay, she is channeling the thoughts of a man
traumatized when the reservoir flooded the town, and apples
actually are part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   For Jordan, this means turning the film ever trippier, throwing
in everything plus the kitchen sink, which vomits brown mush at one
overwrought moment, to simulate his heroine's ordeal. The film
reaches a pinnacle of the bizarre when Claire and the killer seem
to meld during a violent escape from a mental hospital, after which
the killer's ``Silence of the Lambs''-style lair _ an art
director's fever dream _ is finally revealed.
</P>
<P>
   These may sound like dreams born of eating pepperoni pizza while
watching ``The X-Files,'' but ``In Dreams'' manages to make them
genuinely strange. The production is elaborate, especially in its
underwater sequences, and Khondji's cinematography often seems to
lend scenes an extra dimension. The camera may swoop vertically
when least expected to, or hint at a second world that mysteriously
co-exists with the main action. (While the main characters are seen
in a long, gleaming corridor at a police station, the eye is
simultaneous drawn to goings-on far behind them.)
</P>
<P>
   The film's insistent symbolism, dramatic costumes (by Jeffrey
Kurland) and experimental use of color, sometimes eerily bold and
sometimes deliberately faded, also keeps things sufficiently weird.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. Bening's role calls for her to be alternately
somnambulant and hysterical, she gives it fervent energy and never
camps up the horror, even when all those apples would have made it
easy. Quinn has less to do in a role that treats him as the dog's
breakfast in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Downey Jr., who arrives most frighteningly, late in the
film, puts in the appearance most likely to make spines tingle. In
a chilling, deceptively casual-looking performance, this brave and
ever-astonishing actor courts the ridiculous even as he makes the
story's craziest dreams come true. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RATING: ``In Dreams'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity, sexual situations
and several grisly fantasies.  &QL;

IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH `THE PJS'?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The demon box flickers along the 3900 block of
Ursula Street, just waiting to disturb the peace, lure
impressionable young minds into addiction and crime, and devalue
anything within a five-mile radius, whether property or
self-esteem. The show comes from another ugly 2-story tenement
among other ugly tenements, but it is an object of legend in this
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Folks here call it ``the druggie room.'' It is a high-traffic,
two-bedroom apartment in the type of building that's disappearing
in many inner-city areas because the only people who want and need
them tend to be black and Hispanic, poor and voiceless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be a nice place,'' says Larry Maxwell, who moved
into this south central neighborhood in 1985. ``Clean, kept up.
People looked out for one another. You know? None of that shootin'
and gang-bangin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell was healthy then, and worked at a tile company in
Inglewood. Now 56 and disabled, he spends much of his day on his
bed, mainlining antibiotics from a plastic IV bag that hangs from
an electrical cord strung across his window. He has an infection in
his left leg. The right aches with arthritis every time it rains or
threatens to.
</P>
<P>
   When outside, he's in a wheelchair with his cousin by his side.
This is where we meet. Michael Preston lives three miles up the
street, in an apartment way too crowded to take Maxwell in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just do what I can,'' says Michael, who is 35 and works
downtown as a courier. ``Usually we just stand right here and
chill. Right here at the gate. We don't go up the block because we
know what's up there.''
</P>
<P>
   There are gates and bars all around us. On windows, on doors,
surrounding the tenements as if to keep everyone out. Or in. The
people here go about their lives in a zombielike state. Looking
straight ahead and rarely smiling. Women pushing baby strollers.
Men standing on corners clutching brown paper bags.
</P>
<P>
   On most nights, Larry sees the flicker of the box from the
druggie room and watches it dance with the glare beaming from his
own. His comes from one of those big-screen television sets that is
his most expensive possession.
</P>
<P>
   He often wonders what's coming out of the demon box across the
way and if it's the same thing that's coming out of his. ``I don't
even know why I care,'' he says, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   Michael knows. ``Because you hope you don't have the same
tastes,'' he tells him. ``Larry likes that show about the guy who
gets revenge on the criminals ... (''Vengeance Unlimited''). I
think he wants to be that guy. If he could only walk.''
</P>
<P>
   As we talk, in another part of town, men and women who look like
them are protesting on their behalf. I ask Larry if he's heard of
the protest in front of 20th Century Fox Studios in Century City.
He hadn't. I say they're marching for him. Activist Najee Ali and
his Project Islamic HOPE (Helping Oppressed People Everywhere) are
certain that the new Fox TV series ``The PJs,'' centered on
poverty-stricken blacks, is ``a slap in the face.'' That it's
insensitive and offensive to mine these lives for laughs.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly he feels it trivializes and desensitizes the pain and
devastating suffering of people like Larry, those stuck in hopeless
situations.
</P>
<P>
   I read to Larry the activist's quotes. He's staring at his
television, where ``Judge Joe Brown'' is holding court. At first he
says nothing. Then he mentions that he didn't watch ``The PJs.''
But he wants to, because he likes Eddie Murphy, who supplies the
lead voice as a housing project superintendent and is one of the
show's many executive producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie is not out to make anyone look like anything,'' Larry
says. ``He's out to act a fool and make some money. This Ali or
whatever is not out to save anybody. He's out to save himself. Me?
I'm out for me, too. So I understand. They just happen to be in
better situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lemme say this,'' he continues. ``I ain't never seen any of
those people here in my living room giving me a damn thing,'' he
says of the protesters. ``Never. And they're helping me?''
</P>
<P>
   Michael speaks. ``So they get the show off the air like they did
the slavery show (''The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer,'' about a
black butler working in the Lincoln administration). We're still
here, you know? Our lives are no better. Them, they go back to
their comfortable homes and just wait for the next show that pisses
them off.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ali is certain that the demon box helped get them there.
Helped in the oppression. Helped shape the minds of the young.
Helped kill the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   I ask if they believe in the power of TV images, that watching
negative images of people who look like them can, over time,
literally suck the life out of you. They do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if they really want to protest something,'' Larry says,
not taking his attention away from ``Judge Joe Brown,'' ``protest
that druggie room. Those ain't no images. That's real. That ``PJs''
ain't got nothing on reality.''
</P>

`60 MINUTES II,': A CHIP OFF THE OLD CLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (production notes at end)  
 (rk)  
 By CARYN JAMES c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only in the pantheon that is ``60 Minutes'' would a group of
reporters in their 40s and 50s be considered whippersnappers. Yet
that was the idea behind ``60 Minutes II,'' which premiered on
Wednesday. No one was ever shouting ``Watch out, MTV,'' but the
clone of the revered CBS newsmagazine was meant to perpetuate the
brand name with a fresher, younger version. As it turns out, the
original ``60 Minutes'' is serious and staid; the new ``60
Minutes'' is serious and staid. Dolly the cloned sheep does not
have a closer resemblance to the DNA that spawned her than ``60
Minutes II'' has to its ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   That reassuring sameness was the point, of course. A franchise
is about delivering the same product _ a burger, a doughnut, a
newsmagazine _ anywhere and anytime. (Bryant Gumbel, whose CBS
newsmagazine died in one season, would know about the risks of
starting from scratch.) Still, it may have been more revealing than
anyone intended when Dan Rather, signing off the ``CBS Evening
News'' on Wednesday, promoted ``60 Minutes II'' by saying, ``Look
for the familiar stopwatch and the high-quality storytelling.'' It
sounded a bit as if he were suggesting, ``Look for the golden
arches'' and stop at McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   He was right about the quality; the stories were solid if not
scintillating, especially the lead report, by Rather, in which
cameras traveled to a secret city with nuclear reactors, all built
inside a mountain in Siberia. But the familiar style was more
striking than any story. Such determined branding of a series gets
to the heart of what newsmagazines do: make money for networks
(because they are much less expensive to produce than
entertainment) and feed an apparently unsated audience appetite for
real-life dramas.
</P>
<P>
   The networks now offer a dozen hours a week of prime-time
newsmagazines, and on Wednesday it was possible to watch three of
them back-to-back, each part of a series: NBC's ``Dateline'' at 8
p.m., ``60 Minutes II'' at 9 p.m. and ABC's ``20/20'' at 10 p.m.
Along with the five hours coming up this weekend, they offer the
full complement of stories these programs thrive on:
heart-wrenching reports about children, heart-wrenching stories
about pets and a flood of consumer and health reports.
</P>
<P>
   The old ``60 Minutes'' is distinguished by a more serious tone
and an absence of fluffy consumer gimmicks and graphics (no
``Dateline Timeline'' quizzes), though it wouldn't have meant the
death of journalistic standards if they had added a sleeker look to
``60 Minutes II.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there are the same mock-magazine pages in the
background, the identical format, even some of the same people.
``I'm Dan Rather,'' the program began. Before becoming the
network's anchor, he was, of course, on ``60 Minutes'' for years.
``I'm Bob Simon, I'm Charlie Rose, I'm Vicki Mabrey,'' the
correspondents went on, and the intros ended with, ``I'm Mike
Wallace,'' sandwiching the new reporters between those from the
first ``60 Minutes.'' Blink and you wouldn't have noticed the
difference. ``60 Minutes II'' does have its own producer, Jeff
Fager, but his approach in this first program was to stay safely in
the original's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   The lead report, about the secret city called Krasnoyarsk-26,
was itself a statement that the program will tackle serious issues
if there are enough dramatic pictures. The television cameras moved
through dark, spooky train tunnels cut in a mountain to emerge in a
glistening, futuristic nuclear plant, a remnant of the Cold War
years, that still manufactures plutonium. With the Russian economy
in collapse, the United States is concerned that someone from
Krasnoyarsk-26 will sell plutonium to Iraq, Iran or another country
desperate to create a nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Following a common pattern in newsmagazines, the report left
many questions unasked in the interest of constructing a swift,
focused television story. When Bill Richardson, the secretary of
energy, told Rather that the possibility of a ``rogue country''
getting plutonium was ``the most alarming threat that America has
today,'' no one asked about the threat posed by biological weapons.
(Always end with an ominous sound bite.) But the report was
refreshingly upfront about the method of newsmagazines, making it
clear that while Rather narrated the story, it was George Crile,
the producer, who went to Siberia with the camera crew.
</P>
<P>
   A second story was reported by Carol Marin, an occasional
contributor to the program. She's in the Lesley Stahl chair; they
sound alike and share a similar businesslike style. Her interview
with David Schippers, the Republicans' counsel for the House
Judiciary Committee during the impeachment, didn't offer any
bombshells. It did convey some personal background (he once studied
for the priesthood, is now the father of 10, grandfather of 25 and
still a Democrat), and captured the anger evident at the House
hearings. ``An Irish-Catholic Democrat from Chicago is real,'' he
growls, describing himself in opposition to the population of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And in what will be a regular segment in which an old ``60
Minutes'' story, is updated, Wallace introduced his 1982 report on
Amerasian children in Vietnam. The original report held up
remarkably well, but the fresh segment seemed oddly truncated.
</P>
<P>
   On any night, any one of the newsmagazines might be the most
dynamic. On Wednesday, it happened to be ``20/20,'' with Diane
Sawyer's unsettling report on Russian orphanages, in which children
have been wrongly labeled as retarded are left to languish in their
beds. Some have atrophied limbs; all are condemned to a life in
institutions, many unnecessarily. It was the kind of story that
sounds calculated to tug at the heartstrings, but its
straightforward tone and clarity (it was done in cooperation with
Human Rights Watch) took it beyond that. And while Sam Donaldson's
interview with Larry Flynt gave the subject the publicity he so
desires, it also labeled him a pornographer and peppered him with
unexpectedly tough questions.
</P>
<P>
   In the broad landscape of newsmagazines, ``60 Minutes'' long ago
became simply one option, not the only program worth watching. And
as ``60 Minutes II'' evolves, it might even develop an identity of
its own. Jimmy Tingle, a stand-up comedian and writer, was given
the Andy Rooney slot. Rooney's is the one wholly tiresome segment
of ``60 Minutes,'' yet Tingle ended the new program with an
unexpectedly brisk political satire.
</P>
<P>
   He observed that when the Lewinsky scandal broke, the entire
American press contingent hot-footed it back to Washington from
Cuba, where they had been covering the pope's meeting with Fidel
Castro; that would have been the perfect time for Clinton to race
to Cuba, he said, and maybe even confess something to the pope.
Tingle's appearance was the program's only fresh touch so far, and
the least likely one. It's worth remembering that the people who
fretted that ``60 Minutes'' might be sullied by extending its brand
name were all inside CBS. Viewers have no such misplaced sense of
reverence.

WORK WARRIORS: MILITARY MASTERY OFFERED AS EXAMPLES FOR MODERN
MANAGEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Great generals and successful managers have a lot in common.
Don't be misled by the battles and fancy uniforms. The warriors of
legend, the commanders who achieved dramatic feats on the
battlefield were, first and foremost, highly effective managers.''
</P>
<P>
   So write James Dunnigan and Daniel Masterson in ``The Way of the
Warrior _ Business Tactics and Techniques from History's Twelve
Greatest Generals'' (St. Martin's Press, New York, 207 pages,
$21.95.
</P>
<P>
   In this highly readable book, the authors have examined the
careers of military leaders from Alexander the Great to Norman
Schwarzkopf, including such other well-known warriors as Napoleon,
George Patton, Julius Caesar, Douglas MacArthur, even Genghis Khan.
In all 12 cases, they have found attributes that made these men
successful on the battlefield, and that can be applied to the
modern business world.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the authors give us a short and snappy history
lesson of the world conditions when these leaders lived, followed
by a discussion of the challenges each faced. Then they describe
which characteristics enabled the leaders to meet the challenges,
and how modern managers can learn from them.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples: Patton believed strongly in training and
conducted training sessions himself even when he was well up in
rank. Consequently, his well-trained (and well-led) 3rd Army
captured more territory and more prisoners than any other Allied
army during World War II. Good managers can never stop training
themselves or their employees in the rapidly changing business
climate which exists today.
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon was one of the first modern generals to appreciate the
power of propaganda by regularly issuing bulletins while on
campaign and seeing that they were widely distributed and given
prominent display in the press. Modern managers need good PR to
keep them out of trouble (re: Bill Gates' current problems).
</P>
<P>
   Ulysses S. Grant, among other attributes, was known for his
clear communication to his field commanders in the form of clearly
written orders, necessary because his subordinates might be several
hours (or days) away from his headquarters. Managers who issue
ambiguous, poorly written orders are asking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Both Alexander the Great and Schwarzkopf, although living two
millenniums apart, had respect for other cultures, which enabled
Alexander to create the greatest empire up to his time and
Schwarzkopf to work with the many different countries and cultures
involved in the Persian Gulf War. In this era of international
business, a good manager must know and respect foreign cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick the Great of Prussia inherited a small country with a
well-trained army that was surrounded by much larger countries, all
of whom were potential enemies. He saw that the only way for
Prussia to survive was to expand without upsetting his neighbors,
who might become allies and destroy him. He recognized opportunity
when neighboring Austria was in a weakened condition and seized the
province of Silesia without incurring the wrath of Russia or
France. Successful managers need to be aware of changing conditions
in the ranks of their competitors, and act accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Genghis Khan's armies could move with incredible speed because
of the discipline and organization of his troops. Managers need to
be able to make fast decisions when necessary and implement them
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden recognized innovation in warfare and
borrowed it by hiring experts from other armies, especially Dutch
officers who had learned new warfare techniques during the wars of
Dutch independence. A manager must recognize that one of the best
and quickest ways to achieve success is to hire brains that have
been developed by somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   Many other examples abound.
</P>
<P>
   The authors sum it all up in the final chapter, titled
``Timeless Techniques for War and Peace.'' The organization and
utilization of armies probably was historically the beginning of
large-scale management, and the development of managerial
techniques. Many of these techniques carried over into the civilian
sector. This book shows how the great warriors led the way, and
gives good tips for following their examples.

   ``Guide to High-Tech Stocks &AMP; Mutual Funds''
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Murphy
</P>
<P>
   Broadway Books, $27.50
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 10 percent of Wall Street analysts cover technology
stocks. And fewer than 70 mutual funds, out of around 9,000 total,
specialize in technology. Michael Murphy, editor and founder of the
high-rated investment newsletter California Technology Stock
Letter, argues that fear and ignorance are keeping most from some
of the hottest stocks out there. In this second edition, he
provides strategies for picking high-growth winning stocks.

   ``Prince Charming Isn't Coming: How Women Get Smart About
Money''
</P>
<P>
   By Barbara Stanny
</P>
<P>
   Penguin Books, $12.95
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of one of the founders of H&AMP;R Block, Barbara Stanny
admits that she knew absolutely nothing about personal finance
until her husband squandered away a large part of her inheritance.
That started Stanny, an author and journalist, on a journey of
financial enlightenment that she shares with her readers, while
teaching them how and why they need to become informed as well. The
book is a good primer on finance, focused on women's money issues.

   ``The Smart Woman's Guide to Starting a Business''
</P>
<P>
   By Vickie L. Montgomery
</P>
<P>
   Career Press, $15.99
</P>
<P>
   This second edition includes many changes, including the
addition of more than 300 Web sites helpful for small-business
owners. Separate statistics, information and resources on minority,
Canadian and international women are also new to this updated book,
as well as an expanded chapter on networking. With more than 8
million female entrepreneurs out there, this book should find a
ready market.

`UNMENTIONABLES: A BRIEF HISTORY': TELLING VICTORIA'S SECRET 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Program notes are at the end of review. Time, channel are for
New York metropolitan area. Check local listings.) 
(js) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Form fits function fetchingly on Sunday night in support of the
proposition that the purpose of underwear is to reveal even as it
conceals. The loosely stitched two hours of ``Unmentionables: A
Brief History'' reviews undies from the useful (it's been centuries
since the chemise was considered mainly a way of protecting
expensive outfits from sweat) to the sensational, with peeps along
the way into some pruderies and peculiarities.
</P>
<P>
   Particular attention is devoted to the ins and outs of the
corset and the downs and ups of the push-up bra. (Howdy, Jane
Russell.) Men get their due in the progression from the codpiece to
the one-piece union suit, from Clark Gable baring his chest in ``It
Happened One Night'' to Calvin Klein and Joe Boxer baring much
else. But mainly the screen is a frolic of female goods featuring
the show-biz dazzle of Frederick's of Hollywood and the fantasies
of Victoria's Secret, whose millions of catalogs are reportedly a
hit among fashion-conscious adolescent lads, too.
</P>
<P>
   A little social history intrudes as lingerie experts detect
connections between costumes and women's attitudes toward their
bodies. Someone observes that in olden days rigging a ship was
easier than rigging a woman of fashion, but then came liberation
and consciousness and other reliefs, although it is suggested here
that credit for the first sports bra belongs to the ancient
Sicilians.
</P>
<P>
   Few wearers since may have burned bras, but many have chosen to
be more comfortable in them, as materials became thinner, more
flexible (thank you, Du Pont) and a lot more come-hitherish. And
then there's Madonna doing her underwear-as-outerwear number.

   LOS ANGELES _ TV critic Ken Parish Perkins takes a different

PARISH PERKINS. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL;

<P>
   FILM-THIN RED LINE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ The difference between a director and a filmmaker is
almost as maddening as ``the thin red line'' that author James
Jones wrote about in his novel of the same name, that line that
separates sanity from madness. If a filmmaker is someone whose
talents are suited to the medium _ whose forte is distilling the
visual power of movies so distinctly that we recognize his
signature in every scene _ then Terrence Malick is undoubtedly a
filmmaker. His adaptation of ``The Thin Red Line'' is steeped in
majesty; he rules the medium like a Norse god. Pulled into his
vistas, we're under the control of a man who thinks with his eyes.

category. &QL; 
 &QL;

</P>
<P>
   FILM-AT FIRST SIGHT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ ``At First Sight'' is a curious object, one of the
most fascinating bad movies ever made. Fascinating because of its
subject matter: Pulled from the writings of the neurologist Dr.
Oliver Sacks, ``Sight'' follows a blind man who lost his vision as
a baby and has it returned to him through an operation more than 30
years later. Bad, because the routine love story that has been
poured over it covers the intense surprise in an unusual suspense
tale. Can a blind man learn to see? By ELVIS MITCHELL. Story has
moved in ``e'' entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-HURLYBURLY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ ``I cannot stand this semantic insanity any longer!''
Robin Wright Penn shouts about 90 minutes into ``Hurlyburly,'' and
by the time that line rolls around, you may feel the same way. An
actor's dream but a viewer's endurance test, the movie takes David
Rabe's play away from its proper home _ the stage _ and places it
on the screen, where pictures count for more than words (and there
are lots of words). By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story has moved in ``e''
entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-VARSITY BLUES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Funny how conventional movies about rebels often are.
Place a rebel in a sports movie _ a genre that may have more
conventions than any other _ and you're just asking for cliches.
``Varsity Blues'' tweaks the formula just enough to almost work,
but it just can't punch things into the end zone. By ROBERT
PHILPOT. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-HILARY AND JACKIE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Comparing the best of two decades' worth of rock
artists, critic Robert Christgau once wrote that pitting the '60s
vs. the '70s pitted genius vs. talent every time. Genius vs. talent
applies to classical music in ``Hilary and Jackie,'' the two
qualities being the dividing line between real-life sisters
Jacqueline and Hilary du Pre. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story has moved in
``e'' entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
.MDNM/ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-IN DREAMS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ The voyeuristic melodrama of director Neil Jordan has
finally led him to come right out and call his latest movie ``In
Dreams.'' His films (''Mona Lisa,'' ``The Crying Game,''
``Interview With the Vampire,'' ``Michael Collins'') have luscious
swirls of manufactured myth that are laid out a little too heavily
_ they often feel so much like representations of dreams that we're
not sure where the narratives leave off and the inner desires of
the characters start. The symbolism plays like intellectual flash
cards. Still, one thing's for sure: Nobody else makes commercial
movies like he does. By ELVIS MITCHELL. Story has moved in ``e''

   BOX-TYSON-IMPACT _ LAS VEGAS _ What does Mike Tyson's return
mean not only to boxing but to Las Vegas? So far ticket sales for
Saturday's fight with Frans Botha have been slow. This is the first
fight at MGM since they had to shut down casino for two hours
following post-fight mini-riot. But MGM, which sees money in Tyson,
now blames problems on Don King and not Tyson for the ``criminal
element'' and problems that followed Tyson fights in the casino.

MOTHER LOVE AND WAR, ENDING WITH A TRUCE
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STEPMOM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon, Ed Harris, Jena Malone, Liam
Aiken &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Chris Columbus &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 120 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You do not run out on your mother,'' Luke Harrison ( Harris)
sternly tells his 12-year-old daughter, Anna (Ms. Malone).
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that's your job,'' Anna yells back.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, life with father (divorced and with a much younger lover)
and his adolescent offspring (shaky and furious).
</P>
<P>
   Mother is Jackie Harrison (Ms. Sarandon), Luke's ex-wife and a
prideful supermom who tries to control her now fractured brood from
her trophy house in the suburbs. Luke's lover is Isabel Kelly (Ms.
Roberts), a commercial photographer and unbelievably nice, sane
person who has moved into his stupendous Manhattan loft penthouse.
</P>
<P>
   That distresses Anna, who doesn't like Isabel taking showers
with Dad and running around in his boxer shorts. Her 7-year-old
brother, Ben (Liam Aiken), has a more tolerant attitude but tells
his mother that he'll also hate Isabel if Jackie wants him to.
</P>
<P>
   Isabel tries her best with the children when they're with Luke,
picking them up at school, buying them a puppy (Anna says she's
allergic) and offering advice and consolation. Luke, a lawyer and
decent fellow who loves Isabel but remains fond and respectful of
Jackie, tries to keep the peace. Then he announces that he wants to
marry Isabel, which goes over big.
</P>
<P>
   From her perch as queen bee, Jackie swoops down to rescue Anna
and Ben from what she regards as harmful situations, abuse poor
Isabel, who resolutely turns the other cheek, and threaten Luke
with a lawyer when Isabel loses track of Ben in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackie has cancer and it's out of control. Realizing that
she won't be around for long and Isabel will soon be providing the
mothering, the two women gradually call off the war and start to
work out their differences. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Anna objects to Isabel's vocalizations when she makes love
with Luke and there are other sexual references. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Minimal and mild. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE The film is hardly ground-breaking, but it does a
reasonably good job with the stresses of changing relationships and
the reality of death. At the end, it's a sad bit of business.
Parents obviously should be alert to the reaction of their own
children, particularly those in similar situations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-7 This isn't a film for the very young. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 8-10 At this age everybody falls in love with Julia
Roberts. Provided the film's subjects aren't a problem, viewers
will identify with Anna and Ben and enjoy the film. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11 AND UP Older children, especially from extended
families, will find a lot to relate to. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DOWN IN THE DELTA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alfre Woodard, Al Freeman Jr., Wesley Snipes, Mary Alice, Esther
Rolle, Loretta Devine, Mpho Koaho Kulani Hassen &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Maya Angelou &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 110 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, the wise grandmother Rosa Lynn (Mary Alice) is
understandably worried about her daughter, Loretta (Ms. Woodard), a
good-hearted alcoholic and addict; Loretta's bright young son,
Thomas (Mpho Koaho), and small daughter, Tracy (Kulani Hassen), who
is autistic. After confronting Loretta in a crack house, Rosa Lynn
decides what she has to do: send the family south to her brother
Earl ( Freeman) for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Earl lives in the old family homestead on a good piece of land
in the Mississippi delta. Loretta complains that Mississippi
probably has more snakes than Chicago has rats, and notes that Earl
lives in a dry county. Still, off they go.
</P>
<P>
   Bus fare is paid for by temporarily hocking a family heirloom, a
silver candelabrum that is referred to as Nathan. At first, the
inner-city contingent has a gently hard time adjusting to deer in
the front yard and remembering to keep the doors locked to prevent
Annie (Ms. Rolle), Earl's wife and an Alzheimer's sufferer, from
wandering off.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, though, Earl's steadfast patience and kindly ways take
effect. Loretta calms down, stays sober and takes a job. The
children blossom. And when they're ready, Earl tells them the story
of their heritage and of Nathan, which has been passed from
generation to generation since the time of slavery. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE The film could have gone violent on several occasions
but doesn't. Some gunfire in Chicago streets is heard. There is
that scene in the crack house, which is realistic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Some. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-6 The story is all about family, but it's too much to
comprehend for most very young children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 7-12 Degrees of interest and enjoyment will vary throughout
this age range, but this is a solid and worthwhile film for all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP Many teen-agers will be engaged. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE FACULTY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bebe Neuwirth, Elijah Wood, Jordana Brewster, Clea DuVall, Laura
Harris, Josh Hartnett &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Robert Rodriguez &QL;
</P>
<P>
   R 111 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How to describe. Well, Kevin Williamson wrote ``Scream'' as well
as ``The Faculty,'' so basically this film is a little like that
one. Using a lot of old movies as reference points, a group of hip,
durable teen-agers take on formidable evil.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Scream,'' that was a couple of slashers. Here it is an
insidious alien being that starts out resembling a crayfish with
long antennae and ends up as a very large contraption that hangs
out around swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the being craves water, as do all the humans it
takes over, which is its intent. People who get infected violently
infect other people before settling down and becoming kind of
vampires on Prozac (and water, which they guzzle by the bucket).
</P>
<P>
   The affliction begins with the faculty, but eventually it
spreads to every stoned foul-mouthed goon at Herrington High,
meaning virtually the entire student body. One by one the intrepid
little band succumbs until only young Casey ( Wood), armed with a
syringe full of stuff to plunge into the being, can insure
salvation for all. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Extreme and graphic. As he demonstrated in his vampire
film ``From Dusk Till Dawn,'' Rodriguez is fond of dismemberment
and there is a lot of that, though one has to laugh at more jokey
moments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX There is some nudity and many references. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Continuous and foul. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14 AND UP All right, it's trashy and violent, but the film
has some sly fun. Parents' choice, but many teen-agers will get
into this film anyway. &QL;

NFL EXECUTIVES FLOCK TO THE SHRINE BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SAMUEL CHI  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ It was a get-together of who's who in
professional football. But in true NFL fashion, the gala took place
at a practice field with the honored guests decked out in
windbreakers and sweat pants.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Walsh was there. So was Indianapolis' Jim Mora. Two former
University of California at Berkeley head coaches, Steve Mariucci
and Keith Gilbertson, were seen chatting. Bill Cowher of the
Steelers made an appearance, as did Kansas City Chiefs GM Carl
Peterson and super-agent Leigh Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the Raiders and 49ers coaching staff, as well as
more than 200 NFL scouts, were also on the Stanford University
practice field Wednesday. They were there to check out 78 college
seniors who will participate in Saturday's East-West Shrine Bowl at
Stanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chance for our scouts to see these players in a new
environment,'' Raiders senior assistant Bruce Allen said. ``These
are college all-stars, so in essence they're going against other
all-stars. They are going against a better level of talent (than
regular college games) and that gives us a better measure of their
abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The players were put through team drills, as well as individual
workouts. Offensive linemen were going mano-a-mano against
defensive linemen in pass-protection drills. Wide receivers were
matched up against defensive backs in man-to-man coverage. All the
details were recorded in the scouts' notebooks and by the overhead
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   One team with a particular interest in the college talent in the
April draft is the expansion Cleveland Browns. Because the Browns
will be starting their roster from scratch, the draft will have a
bigger impact on their inaugural season of 1999 than other teams.
</P>
<P>
   And the Browns' chief representative wasn't going to pass up on
a chance to return to the San Francisco Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss the weather, that's for sure,'' said Browns vice
president Dwight Clark, who left the 49ers in November to reunite
with former boss Carmen Policy in Cleveland. ``When I left
(Cleveland) it was 20-below with the wind-chill factor. I had to
learn two things about driving in icy conditions: don't slam on
your brakes and steer with the slide.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said college all-star games like the Shrine Bowl give his
scouts an added opportunity to evaluate talent before the NFL
Combine in February. Of the 90 players the Browns expect to have to
open training camp, Clark estimated that about 35 will come from
the expansion draft, 15 by free agency and 10 from the April rookie
draft, in which Cleveland holds the top pick in every round.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a chance for me to get familiar with the names, the
faces and the schools,'' Clark said. ``And this is also a good
opportunity for the players to improve their own position because
they get to meet and talk to a lot of (NFL) people and they get to
show what they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Shrine Bowl invitees went on to stardom in the NFL. Some
were can't-miss prospects like Roger Staubach (1965) and John Elway
(1983). Others played themselves out of relative anonymity, like
last year's defensive co-MVP Pat Tillman, a seventh-round pick out
of Arizona State who became the starting safety for the Arizona
Cardinals as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to perform _ even in workouts _ is immediately
evident for the players. Stanford's Donnie Spragan said he noticed
who is watching and who's talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely pressure,'' said Spragan, who added he
could go anywhere from the third round to undrafted. ``You don't
want to do anything to mess up. But this is fun. This is an
opportunity to improve yourself and move up your stock.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the players are familiar with the drill by now,
having been briefed by their agents. And Michigan safety Marcus Ray
has even more of an insight, since he's living with Raiders' rookie
star and former college teammate Charles Woodson in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see him every day and he tells me what to expect (from the
workouts),'' Ray said. ``I come out here and I want to make plays,
cover, catch, hit, do whatever. (Woodson's) success is part of my
motivation.''

`TODAY' ANCHOR BRINGS WORLD OF BOOKS TO HUMBLE SCHOOL  
 (ADV: PHOTO IS BEING SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS)

   PHOENIX - Sister Martha's miracle arrived in boxes just before
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The boxes contained thousands of new books. There were so many
boxes and so many books that Sister Martha gave up counting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of books was massive,'' said Sister Martha. ``We
could have piled them to the ceiling and back over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Martha is principal of St. Peter's Mission Indian School,
near Sacaton in the Gila River Indian Community about 25 miles
south of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The books were a gift from Ann Curry and NBC's ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, a news anchor for ``Today,'' has never been to Sacaton or
St. Peter's Mission School, which includes kindergarten through
Grade 8. But she's heard plenty about the school's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   She knew about the bathrooms that didn't work and the
broken-down school bus that wouldn't go into reverse and the
constant battle the Pimas fight with diabetes. But when she heard
the school had no books or, at best, discarded books, that broke
her heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really touched me and several people on the show,'' Curry
said in a phone interview from New York after a recent ``Today''
show airing. ``I'm a working mother with two children, and I know
children should have books. Children need books to grow and learn
and rise up into their dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry obtained the books for St. Peter's Mission through a deal
with Scholastic Inc., a Manhattan book manufacturer. Curry read to
New York City children in a charity program sponsored by
Scholastic. In return, Scholastic donated $15,000 in books to the
charity of her choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are wonderful books that we never could have afforded to
purchase,'' Sister Martha said. ``There are step-up books for
children first learning to read to books for our eighth-grade
levels.''
</P>
<P>
   But an unexpected problem accompanied the substantial windfall
of new books. The school's library wasn't nearly large enough for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when the next miracle happened,'' Sister Martha said.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the enormous cache of books arrived, the school
received a call from a volunteer group in the retirement community
of Sun Lakes, 12 miles from the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to know if we had any special needs,'' Sister
Martha said. ``I told them we could use some bookshelves.''
</P>
<P>
   Venelda Neary coordinates volunteer efforts through St. Steven's
Church of Sun Lakes. Over the past few years, Neary and other St.
Steven's volunteers have primarily helped out teachers at St.
Peter's Mission with its large number of students. With two grades
in each classroom, the school's teachers find it difficult to give
students individual attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have tremendous needs there,'' Neary said. ``You see
those little children, and you fall in love with them. All of us
look forward to helping out as often as we possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun Lakes volunteers didn't see the bookshelf request coming.
But a group of retired men who golf together jumped at the
opportunity to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``They donated the money for the materials and built the shelves
in just a couple weekends,'' Sister Martha said.
</P>
<P>
   Another link between the ``Today'' show and St. Peter's Mission
is Joe Garagiola Sr. The former major league catcher and former
``Today'' show host, who still contributes to the TV show, liv es
in Scottsdale. He, like Arizona Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill, has
been a major benefactor to the mission. In fact, Sister Martha
knows Garagiola's home phone number by heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sister Martha gave me a call after the books arrived, and she
was simply ecstatic,'' Garagiola said. ``It gives you such a
terrific feeling to help others.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Martha said the school's librarian is processing the
books before they are placed on the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the Sun Lakes volunteers had better not put
away their building tools quite yet.
</P>
<P>
   Curry said that after she informed Scholastic books about what
happened with its donation, the book company was so impressed with
how the gift was used that it plans to ship even more books to St.
Peter's Mission. She said comedian Bill Cosby also wants to donate
books in the name of his deceased son, Ennis Cosby. Publishing
giant Simon &AMP; Shuster may be jumping aboard, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody I talk to about Sister Martha's school ends up with
tears in their eyes,'' Curry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving is infectious,'' Garagiola said. ``Especially at the
mission. I've been calling it Our Lady of Quicksand for years now.
Once you go down there, you're in it good.'' &QL;

<P>
   Like any good showman Stephen A. Wynn, chairman of Mirage
Resorts, wants to please his audience. Bellagio, his $1.6 billion
hotel and casino complex in Las Vegas, Nev., has drawn 2,000
visitors a day, each willing to pay $10 to see the mini-museum that
opened there in October. When Wynn learned that they preferred art
by familiar traditional artists to some of the more
difficult-to-understand 20th-century works he realized it was time
to make changes.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months Wynn has been refining his collection,
selling works by such artists as Jasper Johns and Giacometti. He
has begun buying Old Masters, causing eager New York and London
dealers to hope for a visit from Wynn or his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   So far Wynn has made two important purchases, both of which went
on view just after Thanksgiving: Rembrandt's ``Portrait of a
Bearded Man in a Red Coat'' (1633) and Rubens' ``Head of John the
Baptist Presented to Salome'' (1609).
</P>
<P>
   These were the two most expensive paintings to be sold at
Sotheby's in New York last January, when the Rembrandt fetched $9
million and the Rubens $5.2 million. Sotheby's said that the buyer
of both paintings was Dr. Alfred Bader, a Milwaukee collector who
is the backer of Otto Naumann, a Manhattan dealer in Old Masters.
</P>
<P>
   While Naumann refused to comment, Wynn was more than happy to
talk about his decision to broaden his collection. ``It's not just
one period of art that's fascinating or fun to look at,'' he said.
``The power of Old Masters is enormous especially when they can be
seen near the work of other artists painting some 300 years
later.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A haunting image of St. George in armor, with the dragon's head
as a trophy in the foreground, is displayed by itself on a wall of
the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It is a highlight of ``Dosso Dossi,
Court Painter of Renaissance Ferrara,'' an exhibition that opened
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The painting's label says it is a loan from Derek Johns, the
London dealer. But the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles has just
bought it, reportedly for $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The painting dates from 1513-1515, just after the artist moved
to Ferrara, Italy, where he became court painter for Duke Alfonso I
d'Este and then his son, Ercole II.
</P>
<P>
   It is the third painting by Dosso to enter the Getty's
collection. The other two are from later in the artist's career and
have very different in subject matter. One is a figural
composition, ``Allegory of Fortune'' (circa 1529-32); the other is
the lyrical ``Mythological Scene'' (1535-38).
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Getty decided to buy ``St. George'' when they
saw it at the Palazzo dei Diamanti in Ferrara, where the show
opened. The Getty is one of the show's organizers, along with the
Met and two Italian art institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not only filling gaps but trying to get the best
pictures available to build on our strengths,'' said Deborah
Gribbon, deputy director and chief curator at the Getty. ``While
Dosso isn't as well known as, say, Monet, paintings of this period
are terribly difficult to come across.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Dosso show closes at the Met, on March 28, it will be
at the Getty, April 27 through July 11. Then the Getty plans to put
``St. George'' on permanent view in its 16th-century Renaissance
paintings galleries. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even curators at the Metropolitan Museum concede that they were
surprised by the enormous positive response _ both mail and phone
calls _ from visitors to the exhibition ``From van Eyck to Bruegel:
Early Netherlandish Painting.''
</P>
<P>
   The run of the show, which opened on Sept. 22 and was to close
on Jan. 3, has already been extended once. But instead of closing
on Sunday, it is now being extended through Feb. 21.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about 270,000 people have visited ``From van Eyck to
Bruegel'' and fortunately the Met has been able to keep the
exhibition up for nearly a month-and-a-half longer than planned
because the show's paintings are from its permanent collection and
the museum had not scheduled another show in those galleries. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to broaden its client base for contemporary art at
its new premises in Chicago, Sotheby's has joined forces with
ArtLink, a two-and-a-half-year-old Tel Aviv company that promotes
little-known artists.
</P>
<P>
   Together they will hold two sales, involving 246 works by 66
artists. The artists, ages 20 to 40, come from 16 countries. Prices
have purposely been kept low, with the estimates ranging from $300
to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   The first sale will be held at Sotheby's in Tel Aviv on Thursday
and the second at Sotheby's in Chicago on Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time Sotheby's and ArtLink have teamed up.
Last year they sold 137 works of inexpensive contemporary art in
Tel Aviv; the sale was 100 percent sold and totaled about $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   An international committee, formed by officials from ArtLink,
chose the works that will be for sale. They made their selections
from more than 9,000 works, submitted from 700 applicants, mostly
from art schools around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, called ArtLink(AT)Sotheby's, has a large color catalog
as well as an internet virtual gallery, (www.artlink.com.il).
Proceeds from the sale are to be divided between ArtLink and the
artists. Sotheby's will receive the buyer's premium, 15 percent of
the sale price.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the art in the Chicago sale consists of paintings
by many who are still students or recent graduates. To help
acquaint would-be buyers, the back of the catalog features a short
biography of each artist and a list of the schools whose students
have participated.
</P>
<P>
   The art is on view, through Wednesday, at Sotheby's Chicago
offices on West Ohio Street, in the River North area of Chicago.

CLINTON AND KING AND THE SEX SQUADS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although making the comparison requires something of a stretch,
the temptation to point out similarities between the sex-related
ordeals of President Clinton and the late Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. is irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   That temptation is intensified by the current juxtaposition of
events. As the nation plunges into its annual observance of the
anniversary of the martyred civil rights leader's birth, a squad of
House Republicans is trying to make a case to the Senate that
Clinton should be removed from office for sexual indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   Although the articles of impeachment voted by the House along
purely partisan lines accuse him of perjury and obstruction of
justice, neither of which reach the constitutional threshold for
impeachment, they are really prosecuting him for his sexual
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clinton lied under oath, which has yet to be proved, the
president _ as the overwhelming majority of Americans appears to
know _ should never have been put in the position to have to lie
about his relations with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's being placed in that predicament was the product of
the same kind of political malice that was directed at King by J.
Edgar Hoover and the FBI more than three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the calendar back to this same month in 1965. Coretta Scott
King finds a reel of tape and plays it, thinking it is a recording
of one of her husband's speeches. Instead it contains raunchy
remarks that King had made at a private gathering at the Willard
Hotel in Washington a year earlier, along with sounds of people
having sex.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the tape is accompanied by a letter, purportedly
written by an anonymous African-American, castigating King as a
``dissolute, abnormal moral imbecile.'' The letter threatens to
expose King's sexual infidelities and proclaims that his Nobel
Prize, his honorary degrees and other awards will not save him and
that all the church organizations that have backed him will abandon
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know
what this is. You have just 34 days. ... You are done. There is but
one way out for you. You better take it before your filthy,
abnormal fraudulent self is bared to the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   That invitation to suicide plunged King into a deep state of
despondency for weeks. The tape was one of the byproducts of the
FBI's intensive surveillance of King, surveillance that included
continuous bugging of his hotel rooms and other bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Coretta King's recollections of the episode, as presented in
David J. Garrow's Pulitzer Prize-winning book ``Bearing the
Cross,'' may perhaps reflect the mind-set of a woman now
confronting a similar situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``During our whole marriage we never had one single serious
discussion about either of us being involved with another person.
... If I ever had any suspicions ... I never would have even
mentioned them to Martin. I just wouldn't have burdened him with
anything so trivial ... all that other business just didn't have a
place in the very high-level relationship we enjoyed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It has been well-documented that King liked women. They threw
themselves at him, and he accommodated them. Garrow quotes him as
having told an associate that he was away from home 25 to 27 days a
month and that sex was ``a form of anxiety reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he struggled with the moral theological dimensions
of his infidelities and expressed that in a sermon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of us has two selves,'' he said. ``And the great burden
of life is to always try to keep that higher self in command. ...
Every now and then you'll be unfaithful to those that you should be
faithful to. It's a mixture in human nature. ... Because we are two
selves, there is a civil war going on within all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   We know now that King's principal persecutor, Hoover, had two
selves, one of which wanted to be a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably though, Clinton's persecutors are not so
double-minded, at least those whom Hustler publisher Larry Flynt
has not yet outed. And because they are without sin, they are
determined to drive out the adulterer.
</P>
<P>
   But could it be that the majority of the American public is
right in its perception that Clinton's political enemies are using
sex to get him after they couldn't prove anything more substantial?
That's what Hoover did. He bugged King's bedrooms after he couldn't
make King out to be a communist.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some people walk into a bar to drink. Others pursue a
loftier goal. Yes, they order a drink, but for them the bar is a
haven for reflection, a seat of learning and even, perhaps, a house
of worship. In New York City, dedicated single-malt drinkers fall
squarely into the second category. With the sensitivity of a
parfumeur and the tenacity of a celebrity stalker, they seek the
finest that Scotland can coax out of fermented barley. Price is no
object.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the single-malt fanatics are a happy bunch. With
demand for single malts at an all-time high, bars and restaurants
all over the city have greatly expanded their lists of single-malt
scotches in recent years. Neighborhood taverns that once offered
Glenlivet and Glenfiddich now routinely stock at least half a dozen
malts, and at restaurants of the middling sort it is no surprise to
see 10 or more malts on the list of after-dinner drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, for the serious malthead, New York abounds in
bars that make a fetish out of their single-malt rosters. They
stock old rarities. They make space for new releases like
Glenmorangie's line of 12-year-old whiskeys aged in sherry, port
and Madeira casks. They even offer obscure bottlings from old
companies like Gordon &AMP; MacPhail or Cadenhead, which nose around
Scotland's distilleries, buy selected casks and release them under
their own labels.
</P>
<P>
   Keens Steakhouse in the West 30s, with 130 malts, is one of the
serious places. It has the look, too. Founded in 1885, it has a
smallish bar outfitted in dark wood and decorated with historical
knickknacks and photographs. On the wall behind the bar, ``Miss
Keens,'' a fleshy painted nude, regards the room with a cynical
eye.
</P>
<P>
   On cold winter evenings, customers file in steadily, about half
of them with the same request: Bartender, can you give me a nice
single malt?
</P>
<P>
   No problem. Asking for a nice single malt at Keens is like
asking the doorman at a downtown club if you could get a little
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice'' might mean a 16-year-old Lagavulin, deep, rich and
smoky, for $10, or an 8-year-old Littlemill, a light-bodied Lowland
malt. It might mean a 21-year-old Linkwood, sweet and malty, for
$13.50. Who knows, it could even be a splurge purchase like the
25-year-old from Springbank ($25), a rarity from the Campbeltown
region's only operating distillery. Malt geeks live for whiskeys
like this.
</P>
<P>
   For those who do not belong to it, the malt cult may require a
little explanation. Until quite recently, virtually all the scotch
sold and consumed outside Scotland was a blend of many whiskeys,
each produced by a single Scottish distillery and therefore known
as a single malt. There are 87 active distilleries in Scotland. To
create the signature style that defines whiskeys like Dewar's,
Johnny Walker or Chivas Regal, a master blender combines as many as
50 malts, adding neutral-tasting grain whiskey to create a lighter,
smoother product. Single malts on their own were considered too
quirky to appeal to an audience outside Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The tide turned as more educated whiskey drinkers began looking
for the real thing and in their enthusiasm created a booming
market. In recent years, enthusiasm has crossed the line into
mania. A few years ago, Bowmore released a limited quantity of
30-year-old whiskey, darkened to the color of Coca-Cola, under the
label Black Bowmore. The retail price was $200 for a bottle. Before
long, Black Bowmore was trading hands at $700. When the company
unearthed three casks of 40-year-old whiskey that had slipped
through the cracks of its inventory system, it put the stuff on the
market at $7,000 a bottle. It is selling, although even New York's
keenest single-malt impresarios have resisted the urge to put a
bottle behind the bar.
</P>
<P>
   All except one. Koichi Hiraiwa owns the city's most mysterious
temple of single-maltdom, the Hole in One, a bar so discreet that
it is almost invisible. On a nondescript stretch of Second Avenue
in the 50s, it has no sign, just a round brass plaque about the
size of an Oreo cookie that reads ``Hole in One _ The Scotch
Club.'' There's a speakeasy feel to the setup. Customers press a
button, then get buzzed up to the second floor, where they pay a
$35 cover to enter a dimly lighted, quiet room with a long, low bar
and small tables. One look at the decor, and the bar's name makes
sense. Hiraiwa has two passions in life, golf and whiskey. He
indulges the golf part by hanging old mashies and niblicks on the
wall, along with photographs of greats like Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   The Hole in One sells spirits only _ Cognac, Armagnac, Madeira,
port, sherry and, of course, whiskey, including about 250 single
malts, many of them extremely rare. The 40-year-old Bowmore is
yours for $980 a shot. There's a 1963 Glenmorangie for $440 and a
1939 Linkwood for $245. Drink slowly. Do not mix with ginger ale.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, the shots are large, about 50 milliliters, or more
than an ounce and a half, and there are plenty of nonrarities to
drink at less than $20 a pop. But the serious, sometimes obsessive
clientele is not checking into the place to drink a 12-year-old
Macallan. They are looking for a life-changing encounter with
legends like the 1936 Mortlach.
</P>
<P>
   Hiraiwa once observed a patron sipping whiskey after whiskey,
scribbling notes on a sheet containing a list of 100 malts. ``What
do you do when you reach the end of the list,'' Hiraiwa asked. The
man looked slightly perplexed at the question. ``I go back to the
beginning and start again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may be hard to believe, some single-malt
connoisseurs balk at peeling off several C-notes for a wee dram, no
matter how rare. Cheapskates of this sort make their way to bars
like the North Star Pub in the South Street Seaport, or D.B.A. in
the East Village, where they can find a generous selection of malts
that hover, for the most part, in the $7-to $15-a-shot range, with
a few wild cards thrown in to make life interesting.

   Scotland has four main whiskey-producing regions, each with a
distinctive style of malt.
</P>
<P>
   By far the largest and most illustrious is the Highlands,
Scotland's Bordeaux and Burgundy rolled into one, with 78 of the
country's 87 active distilleries. Forty-five of these, representing
most of the whiskey world's most famous names, are concentrated in
a district known as Speyside. Speyside malts vary widely in
character, from the delicate Glenlivet to the big-bodied Macallan,
with its pronounced sherry flavor, but in general they are elegant,
complex and lightly peated.
</P>
<P>
   The other regions are the Lowlands, Islay and Campbeltown.
</P>
<P>
   Lowland malts, which include Auchentoshan (pronounced
AWK-in-taw-shun) and Glenkinchie, are soft, light-bodied, sweetish
and very lightly peated.
</P>
<P>
   Islay (AY-luh), an island off Scotland's southwestern coast,
produces idiosyncratic malts with a tangy, smoky, seaweedy
character. The Islay style reaches its outer limit in Laphroaig
(Luh-FROIG), a rich, peaty malt whose oily, iodine character has
inspired comparisons to fishing nets. Connoisseurs adore it. Less
adventurous palates might want to start with the more approachable
Bowmore or Bunnahabhain (BUN-uh-hobbin), or even the deep, luscious
Lagavulin (Lag-uh-VOO-lin), before taking on the wild man of Islay.
</P>
<P>
   Campbeltown has but one distillery, Springbank, whose briny
flavor reflects its seaside location on the Kintyre Peninsula.

VIKINGS VS. FALCONS: NFC CHAMPIONSHIP MATCHUP
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Falcons (15-2) at Vikings (16-1)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS:
</P>
<P>
   Falcons: a plus-20 turnover ratio
</P>
<P>
   Vikings: 391.5 yards offense per game.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTS: The Falcons have the pedigree. Coach Dan Reeves is
only one of three coaches to take teams to conference championships
(Bill Parcells and Chuck Knox are the others). They have the
confidence. Running back Jamal Anderson said this week he is not
intimidated by the Vikings. They have the offense and defense.
Atlanta averages 342 yards a game of offense, and the Falcons'
defense is rated third in the conference. The Falcons seem to have
everything, so why won't they beat the Minnesota Vikings? Because
while Atlanta is impressive, the Vikings possess potentially the
best offense of all time. They have unparalleled explosion,
especially at home, where they are unbeaten this season. To beat
the Vikings, a team cannot play conservatively, which the Falcons
are sure to try. Atlanta will attempt to duplicate the game plan of
the only team that beat Minnesota this season, Tampa Bay. The
Buccaneers used a pounding running game and kept the Minnesota
offense off the field for much of the afternoon. But there are two
important distinctions. First, the game was on grass, and it
somewhat nullified the quick Vikings' defense. Second, the
offensive line of Tampa Bay is bigger than Atlanta's, and that made
a difference. Atlanta will score some points, because Anderson will
probably gain over 100 yards, but the Falcons will see what each
team that has come to the Metrodome has all season _ it is a
different ballgame in the Vikings' house. They jump on you quick;
then, when you fall behind, 14-3 or 17-7, the crowd becomes a
significant factor in the game. Reeves has pumped crowd noise into
the Falcons' facility, but that doesn't come close to duplicating
the effect. Atlanta's defense, average despite its ranking, gets
savaged. A close game early becomes a blowout in the end.

BRONCOS VS. JETS: AFC CHAMPIONSHIP MATCHUP
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jets (13-4) vs. Denver (15-2)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS:
</P>
<P>
   Jets: Testaverde's quarterback rating _ 101.6
</P>
<P>
   Broncos: Elway's quarterback rating _ 93.0
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTS: Is is coincidence that the top two passers in the
conference meet in the AFC championship? Quarterbacks do, after
all, color the personality of their teams and greatly affect their
teams achievement. Little wonder that quarterbacks attract so much
scrutiny. This pair features a player (Testaverde) who has just
begun to smell the sweet aroma of pro success and a player (Elway)
who has long been regarded as one of the best ever at the position
who only last season reached the peak of pro football by winning
Super Bowl XXXII. This season, Testaverde has outplayed Elway. Can
Testaverde do it in one game? Can he in this one shining moment
propel the Jets to Super Bowl XXXIII? Denver owns a bit better
offense than the Jets. The Jets own a lot better defense than
Denver. Check out the runners. For all of the passing, the running
game and turnovers in big games always figures prominently. Terrell
Davis of Denver averages 5.1 yards a run. Curtis Martin of the Jets
averages 3.5 yards a run. Denver owns a plus 10 advantage in
turnovers and the Jets stand at a plus 6. Denver has won 18
straight at home in Mile High Stadium but must realize that a road
team can topple them, especially since Denver did it twice last
year (at Kansas City and at Pittsburgh) en route to the Super Bowl.
Though the Jets will be intensely hungry and prepared, Elway will
slip past Testaverde, the Denver offense will make enough plays
against the Jets defense and slip past the Jets offense in
production, Davis will compile a few more yards than Martin, Denver
will gain a minimal edge in turnovers and the wild Mile High crowd
will add a required extra boost.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos, 28-26.

 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL JANUARY 17
 &HT;    Thumbnail preview of movies scheduled for release through April
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yeah, yeah, we know already: The big movie everybody's waiting
for is ``Episode One: The Phantom Menace,'' the ``Star Wars''
prequel. But that doesn't open till the middle of May.
</P>
<P>
   Before you get a chance to see what happened even a longer time
ago in that galaxy far, far away, you'll have to put up with the
usual winter mix of odds, ends and the occasional surprise.
</P>
<P>
   That includes a ton of high school comedies (``She's All That,''
``Never Been Kissed,'' ``Rushmore''), ensemble pieces about
twentysomethings looking for love (``Playing By Heart,'' ``200
Cigarettes,'' ``Simply Irresistible''), Holocaust documentaries,
foreign flicks and remakes of TV shows you probably weren't dying
to see on the big screen (``My Favorite Martian,'' ``The Mod
Squad''). So choose carefully.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is, in these quiet months when studios aren't
focusing on summer blockbusters or year-end Oscar contenders, you
won't have to deal with the usual Hollywood hype for a while. At
least not until Memorial Day approaches, and The Force puts an
international whammy on the box office.

TEE TIME ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN FORNOFF  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There are those who say golf is better than sex.
Well, traffic on the Internet offers evidence that golf is almost
as good as sex.
</P>
<P>
   According to Golf Link research, golf is the second most
requested term on Internet search engines. A single quick Yahoo
search yields 7,192 Web sites _ more than football and baseball
combined, many more than tennis, cycling and running combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the business world, a Web site has become as important as a
business card,'' said Mil Jones, sales and customer service
representative of Golf Link.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demographics of the Internet match up so well with those
of golfers,'' said Dan Murnan, founder of the expansive Cybergolf
site. ``The incomes are in the high $50s for both, the percentage
of college-educated players and Internet users is in the low 60s,
and 30 to 35 percent travel frequently. And there are so many ways
for golfers to use the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   San Mateo golf course head pro Gary Monisteri is hard at work on
upgrading his own modest site to include tips and links, hoping
that golfers eventually will be able to make tee times over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think golfers like to analyze any and all parts of the game,
always wanting to study and learn and gather more info,'' he said.
``The Net offers them that vehicle for endless information.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``endless'' only begins to describe the extent of golf
information available on the Internet. There are the big news sites
_ GolfWeb might be described as the ESPN of golfers _ and magazine
sites, but there are places to find golf jokes, buy golf equipment
and seek divine intervention for one's golf game.
</P>
<P>
   Planning a trip to Scotland? www.golfscotland.com can get you
started. Want to get married on a golf course in the San Francisco
area? Start at www.weddinglinks.com and see where it takes you.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many golf sites on the Web, it's impossible to do
any kind of definitive top 10 list. Let's just call these 10
favorites:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cybergolf (www.cybergolf.com) is one of the best-looking and
liveliest golf sites around, and it still manages to load
remarkably quickly for all of its action. Two particularly great
features are the free stat tracker, to analyze your game by a
scorecard you can print and carry, and the video lessons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Golf Link (www.golflink.net) specializes in bringing together
golf businesses and golfers, so the point of its Web site is to
draw you in and make you want to stay awhile. There are game tips
and a provocative feature called ``mind game'' to keep you busy,
and a fun little golf tale to keep you entertained. One great
feature is on photo tips for those who like to take pictures on the
golf course.
</P>
<P>
   _ Golf Online (www.golfonline.com) has come a long way in the
last year, transforming itself from an advertisement for Golf
magazine into an attractive, inviting and well organized
information center. Like the magazine's 18-holes format, there are
18 buttons, into areas for women, seniors, juniors, tours,
instruction, etc. One of the best February features is an animated,
slow-motion sequence of Karrie Webb's powerful swing, one you'll
watch again and again.
</P>
<P>
   _ iGOLF (www.igolf.com) has partnered with Golf Online to bring
you two great features. One is the Players Club, which for $19.95 a
year allows you to play the Pro Am Challenge fantasy game for great
prizes, gives you pro shop discounts and tracks your game
statistically; the other is the ``personal profiler,'' which asks
you 26 questions and then delivers lessons geared to your
weaknesses. The lessons will keep you busy for a while _ 101 were
offered in response to one query.
</P>
<P>
   _ Golf.com (www.golf.com) is produced by NBC and Golf Digest.
Its best features are its ``kidz golf'' pages of fun for juniors,
and its search engine, which can help reduce the clutter if you're
looking for specific tips or articles.
</P>
<P>
   _ GolfWeb (www.golfweb.com) is the giant in the industry, the
place to go for this minute's news from the golf world, with lively
commentary and the busiest discussion groups and forums around.
There's little that you can't find here, although it may take you a
while because the search engine is a bit unwieldy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Golf Heaven (www.longdrive.com) is an advertising arm, but it
is worth an occasional look just for its joke of the month and joke
archives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Global Golf Guide (www.globalgolfguide.com) has something for
the discriminating golf traveler: multimedia fly-by tours of a few
of the best golf courses in the world, including Pebble Beach and
St. Andrews, plus travel information for those going overseas for
their golfing holiday. You can make tee times in Scotland right
here.
</P>
<P>
   The Golf Channel (www.thegolfchannel.com) is a useful tool for
those who are tuning in via satellite dish. You can participate in
most of their programs by e-mailing in your questions or comments,
or pick up a quick tip or video lesson from their instruction
pages.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour, LPGA, PGA of America and USGA all have worthy
sites, too, but there's one other site that's essential for every
golfer's bookmarks. That's the Weather Channel (www.weather.com),
where you can create your own home page that offers a five-day
forecast for your city and up-to-the-second Doppler radar and
satellite for your region.

CLINTON-KYL (Washington) - Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl has emerged at the
center of a controversy as one of only three in a team of senators
who have been negotiating in private with House managers over the
explosive issue of calling witnesses. Critics have criticized the
private meetings as possibly jeopardizing the bipartisanship of the
trial. By JEFF BARKER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

KYLDIARY (Washington) - The next episodes in Sen. Jon Kyl's
impeachment diary. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

CAPINSIDER (Washington) - Sideline and sightlines from the Senate
gallery. By JEFF BARKER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

trial. By JULIE AMPARANO. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BOOKS-GIFT (Phoenix) - Sister Martha's miracle arrived in boxes
just before Christmas. The boxes contained thousands of new books.
There were so many boxes and so many books that Sister Martha gave
up counting. Sister Martha is principal of St. Peter's Mission
Indian School, near Sacaton in the Gila River Indian Community
about 25 miles south of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The books were a gift from Ann Curry and NBC's ``Today'' show.
With PHOTO. By THOMAS ROPP. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THINREDLINE-MOVIE (Phoenix) - Terrance Malick hasn't lost his touch
for eye-catching vistas and the poetics of conflict - he captures
the mix of courage, cowardice and chaos that imbues battle movies
with that there-but-for-the-grace-of-God sense. But Malick doesn't
catch us up in the rush of war or the plight of the individuals
caught in its fury, as Spielberg did so well in ``Saving Private
Ryan.'' There are too many throw-away cameos of too many stars, and
while we see the fear of men in battle over and over again, we
never see the bravado that is also present in any fight. ``The Thin
Red Line'' might have stood out stronger as a war story if it
wasn't for the overshadowing presence of ``Saving Private Ryan.''
But even strictly taken as a battle movie, it doesn't rival
``Platoon,'' ``Full Metal Jacket'' or ``Hamburger Hill.'' 3 stars.
By BOB FENSTER. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HURLYBURLY-MOVIE (Phoenix) - Eddie is a Hollywood casting director
in a tailspin looking for the meaning of life amid the posh condos
and constant parties he and his best friends populate. It's three
unexpected women - a two-timer, a runaway and an exotic dancer -
who actually change their souls. 3 stars. By BOB FENSTER. Story
moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BOOKS-NEW (Undated) _ Capsule reviews of new and notable books. By
ANNE STEPHENSON. Story moved in the ``E'' category.

   If I could have picked a moment to retire right on the spot, it
would have been opening day, 1975. It was my first game as a
Milwaukee Brewer after 21 years with the Braves. Somehow, I reached
first base in that game and then took off to steal second. I ran as
hard as I could, and when I was finished sliding, it seemed as if I
was about half a block from second base. Needless to say, it was
the last time I tried to steal a base.
</P>
<P>
   I knew at that moment that I wouldn't be able to play ball
anything like I had for the previous 21 years, but I also knew that
retirement wasn't an option. I had signed a two-year contract with
the Brewers, and they were counting on me to bring a lot of fans to
the ball park.
</P>
<P>
   Besides that, I didn't want to retire. I had become very fond of
Milwaukee in the 12 seasons I spent there before the Braves moved
to Atlanta, and wanted to finish my career there.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, you never know what's going through an athlete's
mind when he decides to retire. Some athletes might give you
reasons, but you're never sure whether those are the real reasons.
In most cases, all you can do is speculate.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I found myself doing yesterday when Michael Jordan
retired. I was on an airplane when he made his announcement, but I
couldn't help speculating about it like everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement is a personal thing. I can't say whether it's best to
retire at the top of the game, as Jordan did, or a few years later,
as I did. Everybody has his own reasons. Sandy Koufax retired at
the peak of his career because he couldn't lift his arm. Jim Brown
retired after his eighth rushing title in a nine-year career
because he had something else to do. He was going to make movies.
</P>
<P>
   It all comes back to what motivates people. And it's very seldom
that the public knows what goes on inside a professional athlete's
head. People expect us to make decisions based on their own
standards, and sometimes those standards have nothing to do with
what a person is really all about.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, some people thought I should have retired after
the 1973 season, which ended with me one home run behind Babe
Ruth's record for home runs in a career. I guess they figured that
would be a way for me to honor Ruth. But it never entered my mind.
I didn't play baseball to honor Babe Ruth. I played it because I
loved it and it was the thing I was best at.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan's case, I firmly believe that he quit because he saw
his ball club being dismantled and didn't think the Bulls could
play at the only level he'd be satisfied with. He could probably
have gone to any number of teams and brought them a championship,
but I don't think he was interested in starting over.
</P>
<P>
   I think he was only interested in winning championships with the
Bulls. That was the standard he had set for himself.

   NEW YORK _ The ghost of the man being celebrated _ blurred and
fleeting but definitely there _ first shows up when the girl
screams. That's the signal for a sequence lasting just 45 seconds,
and it occurs halfway through the first act of ``Fosse,'' the
hard-working but oddly affectless evening of dance by the
choreographer Bob Fosse that opened Thursday night at the
Broadhurst Theater.
</P>
<P>
   At the sound of that scream, which echoes not with terror but
irrepressible energy, a slender, elfin-faced fellow with a goatee
shoots into view, sliding on his side like a runaway roller skate.
The orchestra is playing Cole Porter's ``From This Moment On,'' as
the couple performs an acrobatic, exuberant and exasperated mating
dance, an ode to percolating hormones. You've just received, in
darkest January, a quick infusion of springtime, and it's
impossible not to grin.
</P>
<P>
   Those 45 seconds are famous. They had much to do with propelling
Bob Fosse's career as a show-business-shaking choreographer and
director of musical comedy. The vignette, here vibrantly performed
by Andy Blankenbuehler and Lainie Sakakura, is a re-creation of the
first sequence Fosse choreographed for film, a scene from the 1953
movie of ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' danced by Fosse and Carol Haney. It was
a calling card, of sorts, announcing that an audacious new
choreographic talent had arrived, and when you watch the film today
Fosse's pas de deux still seems to tear through the celluloid.
</P>
<P>
   That was what Fosse, at his best, continued to deliver
throughout the 30-some succeeding years of his career: a sassy,
confrontational and insistently sexual style that both baited and
winked at his audiences. Even at his most ironic, the man behind
``Sweet Charity,'' ``Chicago'' and the film of ``Cabaret'' infused
his work with impudent glee, a show-off's satisfaction in
performing well. That sensibility is abundantly evident in the
long-running revival of ``Chicago'' next door to the Broadhurst.
Why, then, does it seem to be hidden for so much of ``Fosse''?
</P>
<P>
   Fosse may have been cynical, but he wasn't cold. The show that
bears his name has a zero-at-the-bone quality that fends off
emotional engagement even as you marvel at the contortions of the
talented and industrious corps of close to 30 performers onstage.
It's all technique and very little soul.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially confounding when you consider the pedigree of
the team behind ``Fosse,'' a production of the American division of
the now notorious Livent Inc. There are, to start off, the two
dancers whose association with Fosse is fabled: Gwen Verdon, his
wife, collaborator and the star of his most memorable Broadway
shows, from ``Damn Yankees'' to ``Sweet Charity'' and ``Chicago,''
who is the artistic adviser on this production; and Ann Reinking,
the evening's co-director and co-choreographer, who was Fosse's
muse and companion during the 1970s and the woman responsible for
the lovingly reconceived Fosse choreography in the current
``Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   The choreographer of ``Fosse,'' Chet Walker, who was the dance
captain on the 1986 revival of ``Sweet Charity,'' discussed the
sort of project that this production would become with Fosse not
long before Fosse's death in 1987. The show's director, Richard
Maltby Jr., had shown a flair for personalizing and vivifying the
commemorative revue with his staging of ``Ain't Misbehavin','' the
popular Fats Waller musical. On hand as the nominal stars of
``Fosse'' are Valarie Pettiford and Jane Lanier, both of whom
danced for the choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   There was thus every reason to hope that ``Fosse'' would be
steeped in intimacy and insights that could make converts even of
determined non-fans. Heaven knows, at a moment in which the most
kinetic presences in Broadway musicals tend to be the scenery,
audiences are ravenous for the kind of distinctive,
personality-filled dance style that Fosse, like Michael Bennett and
Jerome Robbins, specialized in.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the overall feeling of ``Fosse'' is both clinical and
reverential: part uber master class, part shrine. The worshipful
aspect is summoned in the evening's first image, a large projected
photograph of Fosse, while seance-like, astral music fills the air.
The sets by Santo Loquasto (also the designer of the elegant,
form-framing costumes) seem to have been assembled out of stardust
and tinsel, suggesting a heaven in which eternity is one long
curtain call.
</P>
<P>
   The production's most emphatic priority, however, appears to be
to make a case for Fosse as choreographer qua choreographer, to
stand with the Robbinses and Martha Grahams of the world. This
bookless three-act show, which has no identifying narrative or
standard chronology, devotes much of its early segments to
introducing the piquant, particular physical vocabulary that was
Fosse's.
</P>
<P>
   You know those elements even if you think you don't: the
pigeon-toed stance, the cocked wrists, the twitching bums, the
inwardly turned knees, accessorized with the essential white gloves
and black bowlers. Here, caught in Andrew Bridge's funnels of
light, dancers materialize from sepulchral darkness as pulsing
incarnations of the letters of the Fosse alphabet. What follows is
a study in how that alphabet can be reconfigured.
</P>
<P>
   Fosse was known to say that he basically knew only six steps.
Although he worked for years on creating a ballet for the Joffrey,
it was never completed, and he said he doubted he could sustain a
dance work of any length. His field, he said, in 1973, was the
musical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fosse,'' which includes several of the more celebrated
centerpieces from ``Dancin','' ultimately confirms these
observations. He was by far at his best when working off or chafing
against the conventions of the established musical form and using
his own specific style to bring out the sui generis magic of stars
like Ms. Verdon, Ms. Reinking and Ben Vereen. Numbers that, in the
context of their original shows, sparkled with wit and vitality
often register as repetitive examples of virtuosic proficiency,
from the sardonic dance hall hostess come-on of ``Big Spender''
(from ``Sweet Charity'') to the baseball strut of ``Shoeless Joe
From Hannibal Mo'' (``Damn Yankees'').
</P>
<P>
   Some of these numbers do feel timeless (the fancy-free trio
``Steam Heat,'' from ``Pajama Game''); others are time-warped (the
antiwar sequences from ``Pippin'') and still others, while
definitely period pieces, remain absolutely delicious (``The Rich
Man's Frug'' from ``Sweet Charity''). Segments from Fosse films,
including ``Cabaret'' and ``All That Jazz,'' remind you that Fosse
was a genius in choreographing for the fragmenting camera in ways
that don't necessarily translate back to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   The singing and dancing of the ensemble can't be technically
faulted. Yet there's a weirdly mechanical quality abroad. As in
``Smokey Joe's Cafe,'' the Broadway jukebox musical of the songs of
Lieber and Stoller, the hits just keep on comin', but without the
animating spark that made them hits in the first place or any sense
of their place in history.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of dazzling big numbers, synchronized
full-strength ensemble pieces from Fosse's all-dance show
``Dancin''' (1978), including, the evening's climax, ``Sing, Sing,
Sing,'' the Benny Goodman piece in which dancers become the
physical embodiments of the individual instruments in the band.
(That band, for the record, is terrific, as are the orchestrations
of Ralph Burns and Douglas Besterman throughout the show.)
</P>
<P>
   What's almost always lacking, however, is a sense of character,
and in a Fosse show you were always aware of every person on stage
as an individual. The singing dancers in ``Fosse'' have been
instructed to gaze out into the audience with that familiar Fosse
stare that says both ``Please love me'' and ``Go to hell.'' But
it's just a surface sheen on the eyes. There are only a few
instances in which an infectious rush in the joy of performing gets
past the footlights.
</P>
<P>
   You feel it in the athletic pride generated by Desmond
Richardson's gymnastic ``Percussion 4'' solo in the first act; in
Scott Wise's satisfaction in turning tap steps into a personal
stairway to heaven in ``Sing, Sing, Sing,'' and in, of all things,
the salacious, watch-me delight that a young woman named Shannon
Lewis draws from a 1970s artifact called ``I Gotcha,''
choreographed for Liza Minnelli's 1973 television special.
</P>
<P>
   Fosse's wry personal philosophy is suggested, at the show's
beginning and near its end, through Ms. Pettiford's smooth-voiced
interpretation of the Lew Brown and Ray Henderson standard ``Life
Is Just a Bowl of Cherries.'' Every phase of Fosse's career is
evoked, including his early days as a nightclub dancer. You may not
know this, however, unless you pay close attention to your program.
There is no narrative, no time-and-place signaling supertitles. As
for the poetic biographical references, like the illuminated arched
doorway that evokes Fosse's days as a boy dancer in burlesque
houses, you have to bring your own knowledge to appreciate them.
</P>
<P>
   Watching ``Fosse'' is something like looking at an album of
glossy, uncaptioned photographs. The pictures are arresting and
beautifully composed. But it takes your own memories of what they
represent to animate those scenes with the sorcery they once
possessed; otherwise, they're just pictures.

 MARKS &AMP; SPENCER STOCK DROPS AGAIN  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Marks &AMP; Spencer PLC, Britain's flagship retailer, saw
its stock tumble again Thursday after forecasting that profits this
year would be down to just more than half of last year's.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the news confirmed what many already knew about
Britain's Main Street: with talk of low growth or even recession in
the headlines, many Britons kept their purse strings tight during
the holiday season, when retailers bank on heavy spending.
</P>
<P>
   But even against that gloomy backdrop, Marks &AMP; Spencer _ still
roiled by a boardroom power struggle in November after its profits
and stock price both fell _ seemed to have lost touch with a core
of customers who found its conservative clothing simply too
unenticing.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Salsbury, the longtime Marks &AMP; Spencer manager who emerged
as chief executive after fending off a challenge from another
executive, coupled the profit warning with an announcement that the
company would be reorganized.
</P>
<P>
   But the promise left investors cold. The company's stock fell
Thursday by more than 13 percent, to 339.75 pence, driven by a
forecast of profits of 625 million pounds to 675 million pounds, or
$1 billion to $1.12 billion, just more than half of last year's
profit of 1.17 billion pounds, or $1.94 billion. The forecast was
far lower than analysts' estimates of 780 million pounds to 850
million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The latest news dropped the company's stock price about 100
pence lower than before last November's power struggle, reinforcing
the company's reputation for consistently underperforming the
market. The company's American depository receipts fell $1.25, to
$39.375.
</P>
<P>
   The profit figures are certain to feed into an uneasy view of
Britain's economic prospects this year. Even so, while retailers
reported stagnation last year and economists said the country's
slowdown had spread from manufacturing to the key service sector,
new figures released on Wednesday showed a surprise 14,000 decrease
in the number of people claiming unemployment benefits in December,
to 1.3 million. At 4.6 percent, Britain's unemployment is half the
European average.
</P>
<P>
   Marks &AMP; Spencer traces its troubles to late 1997, when it
announced a $3.65 billion expansion program just as market
conditions were beginning to change. Early last year, however, the
company said its sales were up by 10 percent, and it expected that
growth rate to continue.
</P>
<P>
   When the market _ and some of its customers _ turned against it,
the company was left with an oversupply of goods ordered in more
promising times. In the key five weeks that ended Jan. 2, the
company said its sales in Britain fell by 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the reorganization announced Thursday, the company will be
divided into three units covering sales in Britain, overseas
retailing and financial services. ``Our brand has enormous inherent
strengths, and our task will be to draw on these to create the next
stage of our development,'' Salsbury said. ``In short, our approach
will be to change our traditional ways of working but keeping to
traditional values.''
</P>
<P>
   While company executives declined to say whether that meant job
losses, some said it would mean changes in Marks &AMP; Spencer's
tradition of favoring British suppliers.

 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a choreographer and 20th-century artist, Igor
Moiseyev is a prime innovator of his time. Small wonder that the
audience sprang up and cheered the minute Moiseyev, wearing a beret
and bow tie set off by his blue suit, stepped on stage for a bow at
Carnegie Hall on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Moiseyev, who will be 93 years old on Thursday, is no prophet
without honor in his country, or ours. But even the superb dancers
in his Moiseyev Dance Company from Moscow looked startled by the
thunderclap intensity of this applause. Last in New York in 1991,
the Moiseyev troupe has been away too long. Absence makes the heart
grow even fonder than expected. It has been decades since Moiseyev
taught the world to look at dance in a new way, not only by casting
folk material in a dazzling theatrical light but also by extending
the art of choreography as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the ever-stunning virtuosity, there is a creativity here
that needs to be appreciated on its own ground. Moiseyev's genius
is to capture the distilled essence of any subject he touches, and
this gift is visible in both new and old works on the program.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, the dances are not only from the former Soviet
Union but also from abroad. Moiseyev is no accidental tourist; his
keen eye and powers of observation lead to a big picture with
significant detail, as in the ingenious ``Sicilian Tarantella,''
with its festive cart and human horses.
</P>
<P>
   The new pieces include ``Jewish Suite: Family Joys,'' about a
village wedding of the past; ``Seven Beauties,'' a women's dance
from Bashkiria, whence Rudolf Nureyev hailed, and ``Egyptian
Dance,'' with seven women in the Near Eastern style often referred
to as belly dancing.
</P>
<P>
   There are old favorites. If you have never seen Moiseyev's
version of a sumo-style wrestling match practiced by the fur-clad
Nanayan people in Russia's far north, you should not miss ``Two
Boys in a Fight,'' in its current hilarious performance. The punch
line must not be revealed, but Alexsander Matous-Martchuk must be
singled out for his wit and acute timing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two-day Carnegie engagement was too brief, there is
still time to catch up with the company at 8 p.m. Friday and
Saturday on Long Island at the Tilles Center at the C.W. Post
College in Greenvale, N.Y., and at 3 p.m. Sunday at Lehman College.
The New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, N.J., is to
present the company Wednesday night at 7:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer,'' the opening dance, sets the tone. Dissolving
patterns, slow and fast, build from lyrical chain dances to the
men's festive bravura embodied in grounded, crouching dances and
aerial acrobatics.
</P>
<P>
   This burst of color is followed by the mimetic ``Kalmuk Dance,''
whose dancers, Aleksei Ignatov, Andrei Evalanov and Konstantin
Kostylev, quiver with nuance as they evoke birds and hunters. Denis
Baranov, as a fellow who does not get his girl, leads the stylish
Belarussian ensemble dance, and ``Zhok'' is one of the
fast-stepping mountaineer's dances on the program.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dramatic vignettes, ``Old City Quadrille'' stands up
as a study in type: 19th-century urban couples flirt within the
confines of a formal dance. The comic human insight, although
broadly stated, is apt and grows out of the steps, more complex
than they seem. As for ``Partisans,'' how can one not marvel at its
simulated horseback guerrillas, gliding under their capes or
erupting into a gallop. This famed theatrical image of anti-Nazi
resistance has lost some depth, but on the whole, the current
company's technique is matched by visible artistry.
</P>
<P>
   That is the quality that gives ``Jewish Suite,'' with its
village wedding in czarist Russia, a sensitivity that does not
degenerate into stereotyping. Like Jerome Robbins in ``Fiddler on
the Roof,'' Moiseyev was faced with the limited dance vocabulary of
his source material. Yet there is a distinctiveness to these chain
dances, mainly in the steps themselves but also in a strong use of
gesture. The piece is a vignette, more than a sketch.
</P>
<P>
   The outstanding Bashkir Dance, with seven women mysterious in
their gliding lyricism, had its seductive opposite in the
hip-swiveling boldness of the seven women in ``Egyptian Dance.'' In
both pieces, a theatrical distillation was on view, not the real
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gopak,'' known in Ukraine as ``Hopak,'' and the traditional
Moiseyev encore, an American square dance, closed a vibrant program
that banked not on nostalgia but the living present.

LETTERS, PATTERNS AND SOME SUSHI ON THE SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BEVERLY MEDLYN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are some fun books that help preschoolers learn about
letters and patterns, as well as how to become more open-minded
about sushi. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; KERMIT'S ABC &QL; 
 &UR; Illustrated by Stef de Reuver (Price Stern Sloan, $9.99)
</P>
<P>
   This box set, consisting of a book and Kermit the spindly leg
frog, enables kids to not only (begin itals) see (end itals) the
alphabet but actually (begin itals) do (end itals) it. The book's
illustrations show Kermit using his gangly limbs to form the
letters, which also are represented by the standard apple, bee,
crown, dog, egg and so forth. The accompanying Kermit doll, which
has wire inside its arms and legs, can be twisted to form the
letters in the book. Great idea! &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; LOTS AND LOTS OF ZEBRA STRIPES: PATTERNS IN NATURE &QL; 
 &UR; Stephen R. Swinburne (Boyds Mills Press, $15.95)
</P>
<P>
   Patterns are everywhere _ in rows of cactus needles,
caterpillars, snowflakes, spider webs, giraffes, flowers, corn, sea
shells and butterflies. Swinburne, a nature photographer and park
ranger, has captured the beauty of natural patterns in these
exquisite pictures. Patterns help children identify geometric
shapes and designs, the building blocks of mathematic principles.
The photos in this book also give kids another view of the world,
preparing them to hunt patterns that await outside their door. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; YOKO &QL; 
 &UR; Rosemary Wells (Hyperion, $14.95)
</P>
<P>
   Yuckarama! Yoko brought sushi to school for lunch and her
intolerant animal friends are totally grossed out, which makes Yoko
feel bad. Their teacher, Mrs. Jenkins, devises a strategy: hosting
International Food Day, when children can share ethnic dishes from
their own kitchens. By the story's end, everyone's sampling dragon
rolls, green tea ice cream, Boston beans and potato knishes. This
parable on tolerance is brought to you by the prolific Wells,
author of more than 50 children's books. &QL;

<P>
   DETROIT _ The Dodge Charger design study, introduced by
DaimlerChrysler last week at the North American International Auto
Show here, looks like a modern rendition of the 1960s muscle car
from which it got its name. Under its long hood, the Charger
concept car, like its predecessor, has a powerful V8 _ in this
case, a supercharged 4.7-liter engine producing 325 horsepower. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But instead of the gas-guzzling, pollution-belching engines of
Chargers in the late '60s and early '70s, the show car has a
superclean engine that runs on compressed natural gas, known as
CNG. If the Charger were put into production, it would qualify as
an ultra-low-emission vehicle in California.
</P>
<P>
   With the Charger, DaimlerChrysler is not only resurrecting a
popular name and making the point that alternative-fuel vehicles
can be fun, it is showcasing a new technology to store compressed
natural gas that could make the clean-burning fuel more practical
for everyday use. The Charger's tank storage system was developed
by the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University,
which primarily conducts research for the federal departments of
Defense and Energy. The tanks' compact size, reduced weight and
ease of installation are comparable to the traits of gasoline
tanks, John Wozniak, manager of the lab's advanced natural gas
vehicle project, said in a recent interview. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Charger concept with the new storage tanks is designed to
carry an amount of natural gas equivalent to 12 gallons of
gasoline, providing a travel range of 300 to 350 miles. Typically,
natural-gas vehicles, like a CNG version of the Dodge Ram Van, can
go only about 100 miles on a tank. Furthermore, the tanks give
designers more flexibility, allowing them to reserve the car's
trunk for cargo instead of for bulky tanks.
</P>
<P>
   With traditional CNG tanks, the fuel is in cylinders that are
individually wrapped in expensive carbon-fiber material, each with
its own safety valve. The integrated storage system in the Charger
concept car, and in a test fleet of Plymouth Breeze and Dodge
Stratus sedans, combine the cylinders into a single-wrapped package
that is placed in a solid housing that somewhat resembles an egg
carton, with one safety valve for all. The design reduces the
complexity, weight and use of expensive carbon fiber, and thus
lowers the cost, Wozniak said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a more versatile flat shape, the tank can be installed
behind the back seat or underneath the vehicle, like a traditional
gasoline tank. The Breezes in the demonstration fleet, which will
soon be given to consumers for further testing, currently carry the
equivalent of 12 gallons of gasoline and can run 350 miles between
refilling, Wozniak said. The cars have 12.5 cubic feet of trunk
space, compared with 15.7 for a gasoline-powered Breeze.
</P>
<P>
   The packaging advancements have cut the cost of a CNG storage
tank by half, to about $2,500. Still, that is far more than the $50
to $100 cost of a conventional gasoline tank. Nevertheless,
DaimlerChrysler executives say they think natural-gas vehicles hold
promise because of their high fuel economy, lower emissions and
plentiful supplies of the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, DaimlerChrysler sees potential for CNG
vehicles in niche applications, like corporate fleets that are
fueled in central locations. Bernard Robertson, senior vice
president for engineering technologies for DaimlerChrysler, said
the new storage system might allow automakers to use CNG in other
vehicle segments, including sports cars, beyond vans, pickups and
large sedans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler offered natural-gas vehicles in the early '90s, but
stopped when a fleet market did not develop. Another problem was
the lack of a secondary market for reselling cars turned back in by
fleet operators. Last fall, Chrysler re-entered the market with two
models, a Dodge Ram Van and a Ram Wagon, that meet California's
even stricter ``super ultra low'' emission standards.

&HT;        PENNSYLVANIA GETS ``F'' FOR ABORTION AND REPRODUCTIVE
RIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington, Jan. 14 -- Pennsylvania ranked among the worst
states at protecting a woman's right to choose abortion, according
to a study released Thursday by a national pro-choice advocacy
group.
</P>
<P>
   The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League
Foundation gave Pennsylvania an ``F'' along with 16 other states in
its annual evaluation of state laws, health coverage, and policies
that govern women's access to abortion and reproductive services.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the group found the number of abortion providers
dropping and more laws on the books to restrict access to abortion,
such as enforced waiting periods or required consent.
</P>
<P>
   Women seeking abortion in 1999 have fewer rights than their
mothers held in 1973, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania does not allow a married woman to have an abortion
without notifying her husband, or a minor to have an abortion
without notifying one parent, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   A woman or a minor can seek a judicial bypass to these laws if
they believe giving the notification would place them in danger.
</P>
<P>
   The study also points out that Pennsylvania requires a woman
seeking an abortion to wait at least 24 hours before having the
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania pro-choice advocates said they were not surprised
to learn of the state's failing grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult place to be for a woman who wants to
have an abortion,'' said Kimberlee Evert, president of Planned
Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania. ``The clinics are clustered in
urban areas. It is especially hard for women who don't live near a
major city.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, 75 percent of the counties have no abortion
providers. Between 1992 and 1996, the number of abortion providers
fell from 81 to 61, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   There were 38,000 women who had abortions in Pennsylvania in
1996, according to the most recent data available from the state
health department. In that year, 18,079 of those abortions were in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Violent acts against abortion providers around the nation scared
local clinics into closing up shop, Evert said.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-life advocates said they were pleased to hear of the rank
but thought the laws were reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just isn't the need, so clinics close,'' said David
Bunnell, education director for Pennsylvania's Pro-Life Federation
in Harrisburg. ``Abortion providers are closing because of a lack
of demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunnell said he thought the charge that the state was
restrictive to women's rights to abortion was exaggerated
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like a woman who wants an abortion can't get one,''
he said.

irrelevant. Along with gasoline prices, small-car sales have

 FOURTH-QUARTER PROFITS RISE FOR FIRST UNION CORP .
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   First Union Corp., the nation's sixth-largest bank, said
Thursday that its fourth-quarter profit jumped 49 percent based on
renewed strength in its capital markets business, strong loan
growth and robust fee income.
</P>
<P>
   First Union, based in Charlotte, N.C., posted earnings of $857
million, or 87 cents a diluted share, compared with $576 million,
or 60 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that its operating earnings, which exclude
charges largely related to its purchase last year of Corestates
Financial Corp., rose 34 percent, to $993 million, compared with
$743 million in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The bank reported operating earnings per share of $1, a penny
better than the average estimate of analysts polled by First Call
Corp., which tracks company earnings. That compares with 77 cents a
share in the quarter a year earlier. In trading on the New York
Stock Exchange, First Union's shares fell $1.4375, to $61.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great deal of noise in their numbers _ tax
benefits, gains from securitizations, branch sales and some sizable
discretionary expenses,'' said Sandra Flannigan, a banking analyst
with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``But the basic business is very good, and
they're seeing a nice rebound in their capital markets business.
And in terms of credit quality, there are no glitches.''
</P>
<P>
   First Union, with retail banking operations based along much of
the East Coast, has been one of the most acquisitive banks in the
country in recent years. In addition to its retail business, the
company has developed a solid franchise in capital markets and
investment banking services aimed at midsized companies. Such
activities include mergers and acquisitions advice in addition to
stock and bond underwriting.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some concern among analysts about how easily
First Union would digest the operations of Corestates, how well it
would be able to retain Corestates customers and how quickly it
would be able to make that pricey acquisition profitable.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said Thursday that the bank, despite reporting
expenses that many consider to be too high, was well on its way to
making the purchase of Corestates pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their numbers have become increasingly confusing over the last
several quarters,'' said Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``But I think they've done a better job of selling
products to a post-merger clientele than other banks and I'm sure
they're going to get a good return from the merger.''

 &HT;    GOVERNMENT CHARGES MICROSOFT SKEWERED POLL DATA
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government accused Microsoft Corp. Thursday of
offering bogus testimony at its antitrust trial that had been
initially cooked up to make chairman Bill Gates look good at a
Senate hearing last year.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most dramatic moments of the 12-week trial, the
government's lead counsel, David Boies, questioned Microsoft's sole
outside expert witness over the company's controversial move to
hard wire its Web-browsing software directly into its Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Windows users stood to benefit by that decision, argued
Microsoft witness Richard Schmalansee, a Massachusetts Institute of
Technology economics professor. In the written testimony he had
filed with the court, Schmalansee cited a survey of independent
software vendors as overwhelmingly agreeing with that view.
</P>
<P>
   The February 1998 poll he cited purportedly showed that 85
percent of the developers ``predicted that Microsoft's integration
of Internet functions into Windows would help their (own) company
and 83 percent predicted it would help consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boies brought out under cross-examination that the poll had
been the brainchild of Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's top technology
guru, in launching a major publicity campaign that also included
eliciting supportive comments from such industry figures as Michael
Dell, the founder Dell Computer Co.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message to Gates and other key Microsoft
executives, sent Feb. 15, 1998, Myhrvold wrote: ``I think that it
is crucial to make (sure) the statement we ask people about in the
survey, or the statement we ask them to sign ...is worded properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying 'put the browser in the (Windows operating system)' is
already a statement that is prejudicial to us. The name ``browser''
suggests a separate thing. I would NOT phrase the survey, or other
things, only in terms of 'put the browser in the OS.'''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Myhrvold opted for ``a more neutral question about how
Internet technology needs to merge with local computing.'' The
Microsoft executive noted that he had been ``pretty successful in
trying this on various journalists and industry people.''
</P>
<P>
   The integration issue, a vital element in the browser wars
between Microsoft and Netscape Communications Corp., lies at the
heart of the charges lodged against the software giant by the
Department of Justice and 19 states. The plaintiffs allege
Microsoft buried its Internet Explorer browser deep within the
Windows code and then gave it away for free in order, as one
Netscape executive put it, ``to cut off our air supply.''
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Microsoft survey first surfaced March 3, 1998, when
Gates testified at what proved to be a highly contentious hearing
before the Senate Judiciary Committee. But a week before Gates'
appearance, as the government brought out in another e-mail, the
data had raised internal alarm bells at Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Both facts went unnoted in Schmalansee's 328-page brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some conflicting data from developers,'' Microsoft
executive Ann Redmond warned. Referring to an earlier Department of
Justice action against Microsoft, she cited another survey that
showed that 44 percent of outside developers agreed with the
government's position while 41 disagreed and 15 percent said they
didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``The survey cited by Professor Schmalansee is legitimate,''
Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said outside the courtroom. ``From
a legal standpoint, this is just a red herring.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, a new poll taken for Microsoft and released on
Thursday showed that 76 percent of Americans believe that Microsoft
contributes to the nation's economic growth while 73 percent think
the company has benefited both U.S. consumers and the software
industry. The nationwide survey of 1,002 adults was taken Jan. 5-6
by a polling firm headed by Peter Hart and Robert Teeter.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is due to resume on Tuesday with Schmalansee still on
the stand.
</P>
<P>
   END

 &HT;    GOVERNMENT CHARGES MICROSOFT SKEWERED POLL DATA
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government accused Microsoft Corp. Thursday of
offering bogus testimony at its antitrust trial that had been
initially cooked up to make chairman Bill Gates look good at a
Senate hearing last year.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most dramatic moments of the 12-week trial, the
government's lead counsel, David Boies, questioned Microsoft's sole
outside expert witness over the company's controversial move to
hard wire its Web-browsing software directly into its Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Windows users stood to benefit by that decision, argued
Microsoft witness Richard Schmalansee, a Massachusetts Institute of
Technology economics professor. In the written testimony he had
filed with the court, Schmalansee cited a survey of independent
software vendors as overwhelmingly agreeing with that view.
</P>
<P>
   The February 1998 poll he cited purportedly showed that 85
percent of the developers ``predicted that Microsoft's integration
of Internet functions into Windows would help their (own) company
and 83 percent predicted it would help consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boies brought out under cross-examination that the poll had
been the brainchild of Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's top technology
guru, in launching a major publicity campaign that also included
eliciting supportive comments from such industry figures as Michael
Dell, the founder Dell Computer Co.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message to Gates and other key Microsoft
executives, sent Feb. 15, 1998, Myhrvold wrote: ``I think that it
is crucial to make (sure) the statement we ask people about in the
survey, or the statement we ask them to sign ...is worded properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying 'put the browser in the (Windows operating system)' is
already a statement that is prejudicial to us. The name ``browser''
suggests a separate thing. I would NOT phrase the survey, or other
things, only in terms of 'put the browser in the OS.'''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Myhrvold opted for ``a more neutral question about how
Internet technology needs to merge with local computing.'' The
Microsoft executive noted that he had been ``pretty successful in
trying this on various journalists and industry people.''
</P>
<P>
   The integration issue, a vital element in the browser wars
between Microsoft and Netscape Communications Corp., lies at the
heart of the charges lodged against the software giant by the
Department of Justice and 19 states. The plaintiffs allege
Microsoft buried its Internet Explorer browser deep within the
Windows code and then gave it away for free in order, as one
Netscape executive put it, ``to cut off our air supply.''
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Microsoft survey first surfaced March 3, 1998, when
Gates testified at what proved to be a highly contentious hearing
before the Senate Judiciary Committee. But a week before Gates'
appearance, as the government brought out in another e-mail, the
data had raised internal alarm bells at Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Both facts went unnoted in Schmalansee's 328-page brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some conflicting data from developers,'' Microsoft
executive Ann Redmond warned. Referring to an earlier Department of
Justice action against Microsoft, she cited another survey that
showed that 44 percent of outside developers agreed with the
government's position while 41 disagreed and 15 percent said they
didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``The survey cited by Professor Schmalansee is legitimate,''
Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said outside the courtroom. ``From
a legal standpoint, this is just a red herring.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, a new poll taken for Microsoft and released on
Thursday showed that 76 percent of Americans believe that Microsoft
contributes to the nation's economic growth while 73 percent think
the company has benefited both U.S. consumers and the software
industry. The nationwide survey of 1,002 adults was taken Jan. 5-6
by a polling firm headed by Peter Hart and Robert Teeter.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is due to resume on Tuesday with Schmalansee still on
the stand.
</P>

 By DULCIE LEIMBACH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 20 years with the same body, one of America's best-selling
cars is getting a new look.
</P>
<P>
   The Little Tikes Cozy Coupe always has been popular _ in some
years, it outsold top models like the Honda Accord _ but the
feeling in the industry was that the one-seat sub-sub-subcompact
was dated, unstylish, even _ heaven forbid _ outre. Although 1998
sales are expected to reach a hearty 250,000 (Little Tikes, in
Hudson, Ohio, is still counting), the Coupe needed rejiggering so
it would look less like a product of the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do some styling changes to get it into the '90s,
with rounded corners versus the boxy look,'' said Hugo Sandberg, a
senior product manager for Little Tikes. ``We wanted to keep it
recognizable as the Cozy Coupe, but not lose its look.'' The new
design _ and a new name, Cozy Coupe II _will be unveiled on Feb. 8
at the International Toy Fair in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The Coupe II _ still plastic, and still a striking red and
yellow _ is shaped like a bubble. There are more pronounced curves
to make it, perhaps, more alluring. The front roof pillars are
thicker and shaped like the branches of a banyan tree, giving the
car what Sandberg called a ``safer look.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether a vehicle is a $50,000, three-ton sport utility, or
a $40, twenty-pound foot-powered runabout, gadgets are what sell
cars today. The Coupe II has gone high-tech with an electronic
remote device that emits four sounds a preschooler cannot live
without (besides crying): the noise of a door unlocking, an engine
starting, a horn beeping and an alarm going off. (Collectively,
these may be more effective than crying.)
</P>
<P>
   The Cozy Coupe II has been in the J.C. Penney catalog since
August, with sales in the last five months of '98 double those for
all of '97. A Penney spokeswoman said the remote control was a big
draw.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, automakers' ideas are sometimes borrowed by
competitors, and at least one Little Tikes rival took a similar
view. ``We thought it looked like our Snuggle Bug,'' said John
Sinchock, vice president for research and development at Step 2 in
Streetsboro, Ohio. ``The shape of the roof, windows, columns _ but
it's definitely an improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought Little Tikes should have traveled in a
different design direction, with ``sharper lines, harder edges'' _
hallmarks of the New Edge look that some adult cars, like the
Mercury Cougar, are using. Instead, the Coupe II resembles a
Norwegian electric car, the Think, in which Ford has made an
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Appearances aside, the Cozy Coupe's drive-train remains the
same. A normally aspirated power source drives left and right legs,
producing 2 footpower with significant low-end torque. It also runs
on a variety of fuels, including milk and cookies. Noise and
emissions, the chief complaints of past purchasers, are expected to
remain the same. &QL;

 &HT;    With Harvest merger complete, TRC goes public
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ TRC Acquisition Corp., the Alpharetta operator of Rick
Tanner's Original Grill restaurants, has gone public with the
completion of a merger with Texas-based Harvest Restaurant Group.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has 400 employees in metro Atlanta, is traded
as an over-the-counter stock (ROTI).
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, the merged company will occupy TRC's
headquarters on Holcomb Bridge Road in Alpharetta. Additionally,
TRC's shareholders will own most of Harvest's common stock, and TRC
will designate three of the four post-merger directors. Harvest
shareholders will keep the same number of shares they currently
own.
</P>
<P>
   Harvest had operated quick service chicken and hamburger
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   A company name has not been decided, but it will be related to
Tanner's, said Clyde E. Culp III, the new chairman and chief
executive officer. Culp has served as acting chairman and a board
member for Tanner's. He is the former president and CEO of Long
John Silver's restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective now will be to improve the value of the
business,'' said Culp, who added within the next couple of years
the company wants to be listed on either the New York or American
stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Culp said the company has received a commitment for $6 million
in funding from an investor group _ $2 million last July and $4
million in new funding.
</P>
<P>
   That money primarily will be used to expand the Tanner's
restaurant chain, which has annual sales of $15 million. Currently
there are 11 company-owned restaurants in metro Atlanta and two
franchises in Macon and Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   A new franchise is under construction in Anniston, Ala., and
another restaurant is scheduled to open next month in Woodstock. By
the end of the year, Tanner's hopes to open as many as eight new
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Culp said all Harvest managers resigned at the completion of the
merger. In addition to Culp, executives at the new company will
include Bob Hoffman, vice president of operations for TRC, who will
retain that position. Tim Robinson, TRC's chief financial officer,
becomes CFO of the company.

 &HT;    CLINTON IGNORES OPENING OF IMPEACHMENT TRIAL
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton spent an icy Thursday out of
earshot of his prosecutors at the Senate impeachment trial and, for
the most part, out of sight of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he huddled with senior aides on foreign and domestic
policy issues, called for $6 billion in new police spending over
the next five years, and worked, at times by himself, in the Oval
Office on his upcoming State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   As darkness fell on the capital and his prosecution continued, a
freezing rain forced Clinton to postpone a scheduled flight to New
York. Aides said he still hoped to make the trip Friday morning to
discuss with Wall Street executives ideas for making capitalism
more beneficial to the nation's poor.
</P>
<P>
   On the dreariest of winter days, and surely one of the gloomiest
of his political career, Clinton did his best to ignore opening
arguments in the trial targeting his office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's official day began with a 9 a.m. planning meeting with
chief of staff John Podesta, then progressed to his daily security
briefing with national security adviser Samuel Berger, who
doubtless discussed the strikes made earlier in the morning on
Iraqi defense positions by U.S. war planes, the fourth such strikes
in as many days.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then met with his top domestic policy adviser, Bruce
Reed, who has been working to hammer out remaining details in the
agenda the president plans to unveil when he delivers his annual
State of the Union address to Congress next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Clinton motorcaded across the Potomac to nearby
Alexandria, Va., where he unveiled his latest crime prevention
proposal to a group of police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that in the budget he plans to propose to Congress
on Feb. 1 he would ask for an additional $6 billion in funding over
the next five years to support the hiring of police.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will help to hire and redeploy an additional thirty to
fifty thousand community police officers over that same period,''
Clinton said. ''It'll be the best investment we can make in a safe
future for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not say where the money would come from to pay for
the increase, but he stressed that the budget he proposes would be
balanced, implying that he would submit either spending cuts or tax
hikes to offset the additional expense.
</P>
<P>
   He hailed the progress the country has made against crime _ and
attributed some of the gains to the 92,000 additional police that
have been hired under previous Clinton initiatives _ but said more
must be done to both head off the conditions that breed criminals
and to confront violent crime on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, the crime rate's the lowest it's been in 30 years,''
Clinton said, but ''I don't know anyone who seriously believes that
we have a country as safe as it ought to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returned to the White House, where he had his weekly
lunch with Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   By the time House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., opened the prosecution against him in the Senate at 1 p.m.,
Clinton was in the Oval Office _ where there is no television _ at
work on the State of the Union message.
</P>
<P>
   He remained there most of the afternoon _ at times with senior
aides, other times by himself _ reviewing, rehearsing and rewriting
drafts of different sections of the speech.
</P>
<P>
   By 5 p.m., Clinton was presiding over a meeting in the Cabinet
Room with Podesta, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, director of the
National Economic Council Gene Sperling, Office of Management and
Budget Director Jacob Lew, Council of Economic Advisers Chair Janet
Yellen and other key economic advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The officials were discussing some of the final aspects of the
domestic economic agenda to be contained in the State of the Union
address.

 &HT;    Planet Hollywood execs hope overhaul can boost sales
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Planet Hollywood is recasting itself.
</P>
<P>
   And the Atlanta restaurant at Peachtree Street and International
Boulevard downtown will be chief among those getting a new look.
</P>
<P>
   The Orlando, Fla.-based company Thursday announced a series of
changes to boost customer excitement and firm up sagging sales and
profits at its theme restaurants. The strategy is to refocus its
core Planet Hollywood operations and to explore options to
franchise, sell or discontinue some of its other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Planet Hollywood, which has about 80 restaurants worldwide, has
earmarked between $10 million and $12 million to refurbish the
chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing more with the Planet Hollywood in Atlanta because
it's an older store,'' said William H. Baumhauer, president and
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Atlanta store, which seats 400, is in for several
cosmetic changes, including a new paint job and an expanded bar
area. The menu will be revised with lower prices. And the
merchandising program will be overhauled. The merchandise area will
be enlarged and the merchandise will become more fashion-oriented.
The company also plans to sell more city-specific items, as well as
the popular Planet Hollywood merchandise, Baumhauer said.
</P>
<P>
   The changes at the Atlanta restaurant are expected to be
completed in either April or May, with much of the work done at
night to be less disruptive to business.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has ``one of our better restaurants,'' he said. ``It's
not in the top level, but it is certainly a good restaurant for us.
A lot of tourists come into Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to report a pre-tax charge between $130
million and $160 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998,
primarily related to asset write-downs. Sales are projected at $75
million for the fourth quarter, with comparable store sales for the
quarter down by approximately 19 percent. For the full year 1998,
excluding the charge, the company expects to report total sales of
$365 million. Comparable store sales for the year declined by about
18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Planet Hollywood hasn't changed much since it began in 1991,''
Baumhauer said. ``We want to bring it up to the year 2000,
literally. Our goal is to put a consistently good product out.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy could work, but ``they have a lot ahead of them,''
said Barbara Cappaert, an analyst with KDP Investment Advisors in
Chicago. ``It takes at least two years to turn around a
restaurant's operations _ if you have the right formula to start
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of the year, she expects the company to announce
restaurant closings, which ``usually go hand-in-hand with the more
dramatic operating restructuring.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall ``theme restaurants have been experiencing a tremendous
amount of difficulty in getting repeat customers into their units
and keeping the entertainment side of the restaurant package new
and exciting,'' she said. ``And Planet Hollywood has definitely
gotten whipsawed by that this year. There's been a lot of criticism
about them not attracting the same level of celebrities as they did
when they first opened.''
</P>
<P>
   Baumhauer said the company wants to put a little more
``Hollywood'' into the restaurants, possibly using tie-ins to
current movies.
</P>
<P>
   The company also owns the Official All Star Cafe, which opened
on Peachtree Street in 1997. The only change in store for that
restaurant is more promotions using local sports celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Planet Hollywood's stock closed Thursday at $3.12 1/2, up 50
cents.

REHNQUIST OPENS TRIAL WITH UNCOMMON REQUEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, presiding over
the Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton, began Thursday's
session by making an unusual request of the 100 senators sitting in
front of him.
</P>
<P>
   There may be occasions during the trial, Rehnquist said, when he
needs to stand up and stretch his back. When that happens,
Rehnquist said, the trial should continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention that the proceedings should be in any way
interrupted when I do so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice's need to stand after prolonged sitting is a
well-known feature of oral arguments at the Supreme Court, where
Rehnquist will quietly get up and duck behind a curtain in back of
the bench. There, he can stretch his back while still listening to
the lawyers and other justices over loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist, 74, underwent back surgery in 1995 to relieve
compression of his spinal cord. Despite the surgery, Rehnquist
returned to his duties after 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist has served on the high court for 27 years and has been
chief justice since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   David Cole, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown
University in Washington who has argued before the chief justice,
said lawyers who go before the Supreme Court have become accustomed
to Rehnquist's occasional need to stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows he has a bad back, and that he's still
listening behind the curtain,'' he said. ``I think everyone,
especially men, can sympathize with a bad back.''

EU CREATES PANEL TO PROBE FRAUD CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON - In the most dramatic showdown ever between the European
Union's elected representatives and its appointed officials, the
politicians blinked Thursday, leaving the unelected bureaucrats in
control of the insitution.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in the 626-member European Parliament in Strasbourg
had threatened to fire the 20-member commission that administers
the EU from Brussels on the grounds that the some of the
bureaucrats had engaged in massive fraud and then impeded efforts
to ferret out the corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the parliament voted by a wide margin to create a
committee to investigate further the charges of fraud and
corruption related to sweetheart contracts and $5 billion missing
from the EU's $107 billion budget. Commission President Jacques
Santer, who earlier had enraged parliamentarians by daring them to
fire him, pledged to institute the reforms called for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Because the parliamentarians had raised expectations that they
would stand up to the commissioners who had defied them and fired
the whistleblower who called attention to the alleged fraud,
Thursday's outcome was widely seen as a capitulation, not a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The motion to expel the commission was defeated 293-232. That
followed the 357-165 defeat of a motion to dismiss Edith Cresson,
the former French prime minister who is now the EU commissioner in
charge of research. An attempt to dismiss EU development director
Manuel Marin of Spain was defeated 364-155.
</P>
<P>
   This vote was as close as the parliament has ever come to
exercising its so-called ``nuclear option'' of firing the entire
commission. Under EU law, meant to guard against factionalism,
individual commissioners cannot be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was triggered by national and ideological
factionalism, combined with intense pressure from German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, whose government earlier this month began its
six-month term in the rotating EU presidency. Schroeder is
concerned that a constitutional crisis would delay EU structural
reforms planned for this year as well as negotiations to admit up
to a dozen other countries to the 15-member union over the next
decade. The leaders of the other 14 member nations shared
Schroeder's fear about the scandal's destabilizing effects.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charge that the vote reinforced the perception that the
Eurocrats, as those who run the EU bureaucracy are called, are
invulnerable. But parliamentary leader Jose Maria Gil-Robles
dismissed suggestions that the elected representatives had fumbled
a chance to make unelected bureaucrats more accountable to European
voters. He said the commission could face another censure vote if
it breaks its promises to clean house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parliament has the last word,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Santer contradicted Gil-Robles, denying that the commission was
now under ``political supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Commission has not been weakened,'' Santer told a news
conference. ``On the contrary...the commission mandate continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Cresson and Marin were at the center of allegations that their
departments were riven with nepotism and fraud. But . Schroeder's
forces argued that it would be diastrous for the EU to appear
unstable two weeks after it launched its much-publicized single
currency in 11 countries.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Santer threatened to resign if Cresson and Marin
were sacked. Many parliamentarians argued that Santer's threat, and
Cresson's cavalier attitude about the allegations, epitomized the
commission's arrogance. But the coalition of leftists and
conservatives that had initially planned to dump the commission
split badly along ideological lines as the censure vote approached.
</P>
<P>
   Because most of the allegations were directed at socialists,
leftists claimed the move was a conservative plot to drive a wedge
through the left-of-center governments that now control all of the
major European countries except Spain. Many socialists, who take a
benign view of the allegations against the commission, suggested
that it is a case of mismanagement rather than fraud and
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Edward MacMillan-Scott, who leads British Conservatives in the
European Parliament, said the dispute was not ideologically driven,
but simply an issue of accountability. He deemed outrageous the
suggestions of Schroeder and others that public confidence in the
EU would be undermined by the commission's dismissal, and said that
the opposite is true. To allow the commission to escape sanction in
this case only reinforces the belief that bureaucrats spend
Europeans' tax money without accountability.

<P>
   The scandal, which has been bubbling for months, exploded last
month when Paul van Buitenen, a Dutch auditor working for the
commission, sent a 34-page report to parliamentarians that claimed
commissioners were awarding contracts to friends and relatives and
undermining efforts to root out fraud and waste. The commissioners
promptly fired van Buitenen on the ground that he violated rules by
leaking the information.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the commissioners fueled charges that they are
unaccountable tyrants.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Cox, the Irish moderate who was among those leading the
charge to dismiss the commission, said Thursday's outcome marked a
moral victory for those who want to make the European Union more
democratic. But even Cox acknowledged the progress was
``crab-like'' -- a sideways step toward democratic accountability.

TAYLOR BACK IN THE LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It has been a roller-coaster season for Bruins center
Tim Taylor. He has been in the lineup, out of the lineup, back in
the lineup, back out, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night in Buffalo, Taylor will be in the lineup for the
first time since Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
   He first sprained his ankle Oct. 14 in Colorado. He missed 12
games, came back for one, then reinjured it Nov. 13 against the
Rangers in New York. He sat out the next six games, then returned
for three before aggravating it most recently against Carolina,
forcing him out of the last 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   When Taylor suffered the latest setback, he was told he'd be out
until after the All-Star break next weekend, but after practicing
all week with the club, he felt well enough to return early.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some key games coming up, and I want to get in
there,'' said Taylor. ``I feel like now after going through these
days of practice that it's behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has discovered that coach Pat Burns was correct when he
told him that sprained ankles can take longer to heal than broken
ones. Each time Taylor has felt ready to return, he has tweaked the
ankle or caught it in a rut or, in one case, had two players fall
on it at the same time. That led to some trepidation during
workouts this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous, of course, because of the long process it's
taken,'' said Taylor. ``Before, I thought I was ready. But this is
different now. We've taken a lot of time and patience with this
thing. I got hit three or four times in practice this week, and it
was the first time I went through hitting drills and it didn't
bother me, not once at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt anything is going to happen with my ankle now. We've
given it enough time. It's still not as strong as my other ankle,
but it's a situation where I can play through it. Hopefully as time
goes on, I won't be able to feel it as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor feels it most not during workouts but on the half-hour
drive home. After he's been out of the car for a while, the ankle
calms down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor said it was going to be a long process,'' he said.
``I kept thinking, `Oh my God, is this going to last my whole
career?' He did say that it takes a long time to heal but once it's
healed, it's not going to bother me. It's just getting through the
healing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bourque on target
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's return wasn't the only good news on the injury front.
Ray Bourque skated for a second day after suffering a hip flexor
injury that caused him to miss last Saturday's final Boston
appearance at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens. He believes he'll play
Friday night. ``I didn't have any stiffness and it didn't get any
worse,'' he said. ``It still felt good (Thursday morning). The
skate went well. I'll go to Buffalo and skate (Friday morning). I
think I have a really good chance to play. Right now I'd say the
chances of me playing are real good. It feels fine practicing and
all that, but you really don't get to the level that you do in
games. It's the type of thing where I think I'll end up playing and
go from there and see how it feels. I think I'll be fine.'' . . .
The Bruins have faced the Sabres twice this season, losing both by
a combined 8-3 score. The Sabres are 11-6-2 at home this season and
are 4 points ahead of the Bruins in the Northeast Division. ``We
forget where that team was three years ago,'' said Burns of the
1995-96 season, when Buffalo missed the playoffs. ``After that,
they got better. They're struggling a little bit after a tough road
trip, but everyone is going to have that.'' . . . Sabres goalie
Dominik Hasek has a 20-9-6 record and a 1.96 goals-against average
in 37 games. ``He doesn't get too much credit in my book,'' said
Burns . . . The Bruins recalled defenseman Brandon Smith and
forward Andre Savage from Providence for Friday night's game.

TIPPER GORE FIELDS INITIATIVES TO HELP MENTALLY ILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N. H. _ Highlighting a signature issue, Tipper Gore,
the wife of Vice President Al Gore, introduced several White House
initiatives Thursday that were aimed at preventing and treating
mental illnesses and erasing the stigma for millions of Americans
who suffer from them.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who serves as mental health policy adviser to President
Clinton, announced that the first White House conference on mental
health would be held this spring. She said it would bring together
health care providers, consumers, and government officials to look
for ways to improve conditions for people with mental illnesses,
from new treatments to community strategies for housing and
employment.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing psychiatry students at Dartmouth College's
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Mrs. Gore said, ``Despite the
many advances we have made in treating mental illness _ with new
drugs, less institutionalization, and better community health
services _ mental illness continues to be treated differently from
physical illness. This in turn leads to more misunderstand ing,
greater stigma and discrimination, increased reluctance to seek
help, and greater disparity in insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a vicious cycle really, but we can do something about
it,'' Mrs. Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the White House conference, Mrs. Gore said the
Clinton administration will propose a $70 million increase in the
federal budget for mental health services delivered by the states.
The total block grant, which helps communities serve hard-to-reach
adults and children with mental illnesses, would total $358 million
in fiscal 2000, a 24 percent increase over 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore, who began a day in Manchester, Nashua, Hanover, and
Concord, also said the president has asked government personnel
managers to examine ways to encourage federal hiring of people with
mental illnesses. Under current rules, people with mental
retardation or physical disabilities are provided more special job
opportunities than those with psychiatric illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Faenza, president of the National Mental Health
Association, a private advocacy group, hailed the initiatives as
breakthroughs and called them a ``terrific way for the federal
government to bring federal attention to mental health services,
which have been terribly neglected.''
</P>
<P>
   Faenza said Mrs. Gore was a ``sparkplug'' for the issue of
mental health, noting that she was instrumental in the
adminstration pushing for a 1996 law that requires insurance
companies and employers to offer health care coverage for mental
illnesses that is comparable with physical illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say they believe the political focus on mental
illnesses has been sharpened in the last year by highly publicized,
violent crimes, such as school shootings and the murders of two
policemen on Capitol Hill, which were allegedly committed by
individuals with psychiatric problems.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day _ the coldest this year in the state _ Mrs.
Gore announced the Department of Energy will provide 640 low-income
families in New Hampshire with home-weatherization assistance this
winter. According to Mrs. Gore, who was joined at the Manchester
Airport event by Governor Jeanne Shaheen, energy costs can consume
as much as 14 percent of the budget of low-income families.

from the proceedings. The New York Times News Service will move all
the stories, but not the excerpts, which are from a commercial
transcription service.
</P>

one-line head. Two other stories will also be on the front page.

<P>
   IMPEACH-DAILY-BUSINESS (Washington) _ From the bowels of the
bureaucracy to the highest reaches of the political class, work
went on, but with an occasional halt to view what jaded
Washingtonians seemed to be straining to view as history. Even as
televised drama, it did not seem to measure up to Sam Ervin
listening to John Dean _ or Marcia Clark questioning Kato Kaelin,
for that matter. In one example, Bob Squier, a Democratic
strategist who worked for President Clinton, said the television is
his office was not working properly, so he walked home to watch,
tuned in ``and promptly fell asleep.'' By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-OBSTRUCT (Washington) _ In laying out the case against
President Clinton on the Senate floor Thursday, the House managers
regularly used several phrases directly from the federal statutes
prohibiting perjury and obstruction of justice. Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, R-Ark., who detailed the obstruction case against the
president, began his presentation by saying that ``the evidence
will show there was a scheme developed to obstruct the
administration of justice and that is illegal,'' language taken in
part from the federal criminal code. In drawing on those laws, the
House managers were using statutes explicitly designed to allow
prosecutors the widest possible leeway in determining whether to
charge someone. By Neil Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-HUTCHINSON (Washington) _ It may have been one of the
few times two brothers stood on the Senate floor at the same time.
There was Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., pointing to his charts and
graphs, leading the Senate through the obstruction of justice maze
that House prosecutors say led the to President Clinton's
impeachment. To his left, toward the back of the ornate chamber,
Sen. Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas, listened intently to his younger
brother explain one of the two articles of impeachment the Senate
will vote on. By Lizette Alvarez.

</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-WITNESSES (Washington) _ Senate Democrats and
Republicans resumed their verbal brawl Thursday over whether to
call witnesses, imperiling a fragile bipartisan pact. Whatever
frail cooperative spirit was left over from last Friday's unusual
joint caucus seemed to be hanging together by only a thread,
especially as Democrats also assailed Republicans for acting
complicitly in the House managers' decision this week to approach
two potential witnesses, Monica S. Lewinsky and Kathleen E. Willey,
about their possible testimony. By Eric Schmitt.

   IMPEACH-CHARGE (Washington) _ The Senate sat utterly mute and
passive as it began its descent into the familiar details of the
nation's oft-told tale of the president and the intern. As if in
behalf of their suffering constituents, a mood of temporary respite
seemed to take took hold of the senators. A different sort of
attentiveness settled upon the Capitol once the team of House
prosecutors began making it clear that the case for banishing
President Clinton from office involved no new factual details or
disputations that the senators, like the nation, were not already
steeped bone-deep in. by Francis X. Clines.

CANADA-US MAGZAZINE WAR FLARES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ A long-festering dispute between the United States
and Canada turned nasty this week as Canada remained firm behind
plans to pass a law protecting its magazine industry from American
publications, despite vehement US objections.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown threatened to escalate into a brutal trade war
between the world's largest trading partners. American trade
officials issued an unusually blunt warning to Ottawa that if the
bill is enacted, the United States will hit back by closing the
border to major Canadian products _ a move that could cost
thousands of jobs and strike a savage blow against Canada's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a sordid twist to the row, Hustler magazine, owned by
Larry Flynt, published a raw ``parody'' of one of Canada's most
outspoken critics of US trade policies, Heritage Minister Sheila
Copps.
</P>
<P>
   All the fury arose from a seemingly minor issue that both sides
find nearly as difficult to define coherently as to resolve
diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over so-called ``split run'' publications _
American magazines that publish Canadian editions differing hardly
at all from the American versions _ has been a sore point between
the two countries for years. Canada claims that US split-runs could
ruin Canadian magazines by siphoning advertising dollars.
</P>
<P>
   This week the old disagreement erupted into an ugly exchange of
threats as Canada vowed to enact a law banning Canadian companies
from buying advertising space in US publications sold north of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian government claims that special measures are needed
to protect Canadian culture from the American influence. The US, in
turn, charges that Canada is simply coddling its magazine industry
with protectionist measures that violate free trade treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the extraordinarily close ties between the countries,
American officials tend to avoid threats of sanctions even during
the testiest of disputes. But not this week.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposed law is enacted by Parliament next month, US
Deputy Trade Representative Richard Fisher told Canadian Ambassador
Raymond Chretien in a private meeting that America will retaliate
by blocking an array of Canadian products _ including steel,
textiles and apparel _ from entering the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The US threat outraged Canadian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threats are destructive... wrong and irresponsible,'' said
International Trade Minister Sergio March, warning Canada will kick
back at any US sanctions. ``We are certainly not going to stand by
idly and be indifferent to any offensive action.
</P>
<P>
   The US-Canada trade relationship dwarfs all others in the world,
with more than a $1 billion in goods and services crossing the
border every day. Both sides have the capacity to wreak serious
economic hardship on each other, although Canada is more vulnerable
because its economy is much smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Flynt sparked indignation across Canada for his
bizarre magazine attack. The Canadian edition of Hustler published
a photograph of Heritage Minister Copps next to pictures of female
genitalia, and urged readers to submit letters describing sexual
acts involving the Canadian politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's filth,'' said Heritage Ministry spokesman Jacques
Lefebvre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a parody,'' Hustler's Canadian publisher, Belinda
Riverin, told the Toronto Star.
</P>
<P>
   Copps, sponsor of the proposed new law, has become a hero to
Canadian nationalists for her outspoken advocacy of protecting the
country's ``cultural industries'' from American competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must insist upon our own cultural space _ where we can
express our ideas, our values and identity,'' said Copps.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the furor are differing visions of what
constitutes a nation's cultural fabric.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of US trade officials, magazines are a commercial
product, no different from plywood or plastic. ``The US respects
the cultural heritage of Canada and its people,'' a high-ranking
American trade officials told reporters in a background briefing.
``The bottom line is, this issue has nothing to do with culture and
everything to do with protecting powerful (Canadian) publishing
interests from competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's government fired back that magazines are a form of
cultural expression not covered by trade treaties, such as the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jean Chretien pledged that Parliament will pass
Bill C-55, the proposed magazine law making it illegal for US
magazines targeting a Canadian readership to publish Canadian
advertising. The aim, Chretien said, is to ensure the survival of
Canadian magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important to maintain a Canadian identity,''
Chretien told a news conference. ``We have a good case and we will
win it.''
</P>
<P>
   But earlier attempts by Canada to protect its magazine industry
against US split-run editions were struck down in 1997 by the World
Trade Organization, which held that Ottawa's subsidies of domestic
publications and restrictions on foreign magazines violated
international trade treaties.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is particularly murkey because Canada makes no effort
to restrict regular editions of US publications. From ``People'' to
``Playboy,'' every publication popular in the United States is
ubiquitously available at Canadian newstands and checkout counters,
accounting for more than 50 percent of all magazine sales in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadians carp that split-runs are different since they pose
as ``Canadian'' magazines while their content is similar to the US
editions. The only real difference, Canada claims, is that these
magazines could soak up Canadian advertising in issues sold there
without making the effort to produce true Canadian content.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheer gall amazes me,'' said Francois de Gaspe Beaubien,
chairman of the political committee of the Canadian Magazine
Publishers Association. ``It's not competition. It's a dump of
service. They've already their cost of goods in their home market.
In Canada, they've got no cost of goods _ it's all gravy.''
</P>
<P>
   But cooler heads in Canada disagree, noting that aside from Time
and Reader's Digest _ whose Canadian editions date back decades
and, for that reason, would be exempt from the new law _ the only
US magazine that so far has made a serious effort to launch a
split-run edition is Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to see why Canada would want to risk a fight with
our most important trading partner over this issue,'' the Montreal
Gazette stated in an editorial criticizing the Copps' bill. ``Free
trade with the US has been a godsend to the Candian economy.''

ANADA-US MAGZAZINE WAR FLARES

<P>
   MONTREAL _ A long-festering dispute between the United States
and Canada turned nasty this week as Canada remained firm behind
plans to pass a law protecting its magazine industry from American
publications, despite vehement US objections.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown threatened to escalate into a brutal trade war
between the world's largest trading partners. American trade
officials issued an unusually blunt warning to Ottawa that if the
bill is enacted, the United States will hit back by closing the
border to major Canadian products _ a move that could cost
thousands of jobs and strike a savage blow against Canada's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a sordid twist to the row, Hustler magazine, owned by
Larry Flynt, published a raw ``parody'' of one of Canada's most
outspoken critics of US trade policies, Heritage Minister Sheila
Copps.
</P>
<P>
   All the fury arose from a seemingly minor issue that both sides
find nearly as difficult to define coherently as to resolve
diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over so-called ``split run'' publications _
American magazines that publish Canadian editions differing hardly
at all from the American versions _ has been a sore point between
the two countries for years. Canada claims that US split-runs could
ruin Canadian magazines by siphoning advertising dollars.
</P>
<P>
   This week the old disagreement erupted into an ugly exchange of
threats as Canada vowed to enact a law banning Canadian companies
from buying advertising space in US publications sold north of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian government claims that special measures are needed
to protect Canadian culture from the American influence. The US, in
turn, charges that Canada is simply coddling its magazine industry
with protectionist measures that violate free trade treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the extraordinarily close ties between the countries,
American officials tend to avoid threats of sanctions even during
the testiest of disputes. But not this week.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposed law is enacted by Parliament next month, US
Deputy Trade Representative Richard Fisher told Canadian Ambassador
Raymond Chretien in a private meeting that America will retaliate
by blocking an array of Canadian products _ including steel,
textiles and apparel _ from entering the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The US threat outraged Canadian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threats are destructive... wrong and irresponsible,'' said
International Trade Minister Sergio March, warning Canada will kick
back at any US sanctions. ``We are certainly not going to stand by
idly and be indifferent to any offensive action.
</P>
<P>
   The US-Canada trade relationship dwarfs all others in the world,
with more than a $1 billion in goods and services crossing the
border every day. Both sides have the capacity to wreak serious
economic hardship on each other, although Canada is more vulnerable
because its economy is much smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Flynt sparked indignation across Canada for his
bizarre magazine attack. The Canadian edition of Hustler published
a photograph of Heritage Minister Copps next to pictures of female
genitalia, and urged readers to submit letters describing sexual
acts involving the Canadian politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's filth,'' said Heritage Ministry spokesman Jacques
Lefebvre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a parody,'' Hustler's Canadian publisher, Belinda
Riverin, told the Toronto Star.
</P>
<P>
   Copps, sponsor of the proposed new law, has become a hero to
Canadian nationalists for her outspoken advocacy of protecting the
country's ``cultural industries'' from American competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must insist upon our own cultural space _ where we can
express our ideas, our values and identity,'' said Copps.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the furor are differing visions of what
constitutes a nation's cultural fabric.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of US trade officials, magazines are a commercial
product, no different from plywood or plastic. ``The US respects
the cultural heritage of Canada and its people,'' a high-ranking
American trade officials told reporters in a background briefing.
``The bottom line is, this issue has nothing to do with culture and
everything to do with protecting powerful (Canadian) publishing
interests from competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's government fired back that magazines are a form of
cultural expression not covered by trade treaties, such as the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jean Chretien pledged that Parliament will pass
Bill C-55, the proposed magazine law making it illegal for US
magazines targeting a Canadian readership to publish Canadian
advertising. The aim, Chretien said, is to ensure the survival of
Canadian magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important to maintain a Canadian identity,''
Chretien told a news conference. ``We have a good case and we will
win it.''
</P>
<P>
   But earlier attempts by Canada to protect its magazine industry
against US split-run editions were struck down in 1997 by the World
Trade Organization, which held that Ottawa's subsidies of domestic
publications and restrictions on foreign magazines violated
international trade treaties.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is particularly murkey because Canada makes no effort
to restrict regular editions of US publications. From ``People'' to
``Playboy,'' every publication popular in the United States is
ubiquitously available at Canadian newstands and checkout counters,
accounting for more than 50 percent of all magazine sales in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadians carp that split-runs are different since they pose
as ``Canadian'' magazines while their content is similar to the US
editions. The only real difference, Canada claims, is that these
magazines could soak up Canadian advertising in issues sold there
without making the effort to produce true Canadian content.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheer gall amazes me,'' said Francois de Gaspe Beaubien,
chairman of the political committee of the Canadian Magazine
Publishers Association. ``It's not competition. It's a dump of
service. They've already their cost of goods in their home market.
In Canada, they've got no cost of goods _ it's all gravy.''
</P>
<P>
   But cooler heads in Canada disagree, noting that aside from Time
and Reader's Digest _ whose Canadian editions date back decades
and, for that reason, would be exempt from the new law _ the only
US magazine that so far has made a serious effort to launch a
split-run edition is Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to see why Canada would want to risk a fight with
our most important trading partner over this issue,'' the Montreal
Gazette stated in an editorial criticizing the Copps' bill. ``Free
trade with the US has been a godsend to the Candian economy.''

FOR NEW YORK DEMOCRATS, HILARY'S THE ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - President Clinton came to town again Thursday night,
but as far as many New York Democrats are concerned, it was the
wrong Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the president is popular here, more so than in nearly
any other state. But the Clinton they really want is the first
lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton _ and not just to visit but to stay
and to run for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   For months now, ever since the state's senior Senator, Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, announced he would not seek re-election in the
year 2000, Democratic chieftains have been daydreaming Hillary. And
the longing has only intensified since the flurry of speculation
that followed the recent prediction by New Jersey Senator Robert
Torricelli, that the First Lady would enter the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   It was a prediction for which Torricelli admitted he had not a
shred of evidence. But, among the Hillary hopeful, evidence is not
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's wonderful, it would be wonderful if she ran,'' Hank
Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant, gushed. ``People love
her, admire her, respect her. She would win bigtime in the city,
win with women, win with minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Hope, the state's Democratic party chairwoman, has been
floating rumors of a Hillary-for-Senate race everywhere she goes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, her husband's impeachment trial, which seems only to
have boosted the president's popularity, seems likely to work in
Hillary Clinton's favor, too. ``Every day the Republicans keep
banging the president, that's another 100 votes for Hillary,''
Sheinkopf said, adding carefully, ``...should she choose to run.''
</P>
<P>
   There's the rub. The object of desire has shown not the
slightest flicker of a hint that she wants the job in question.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, she hasn't kicked her suitors out the door, either.
She hasn't said a firm and simple ``No.'' So hope springs eternal.
</P>
<P>
   For New York's Democrats have a problem. With Moynihan's
retirement, they are risking a long-held Senate seat _ and they
have no one to fill it.
</P>
<P>
   The ``A'' list of possible replacements _ Robert Kennedy, Jr.,
Andrew Cuomo, state comptroller Carl McCall _ have all publicly
declined to run.
</P>
<P>
   Those who say they might have a go at it _ Congresswomen Nita
Lowey of Westchester County, Carolyn Maloney of Manhattan, and
Louise Slaughter of Rochester _ aren't widely viewed as obvious
winners.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly few think any of them would have much of a chance
against the person who seems more and more likely to be the
Republican nominee _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has been running for something these past several
months, gallavanting across the country, telling the New York City
success-story to hushed Republican crowds, forming a political
action committee, and raising piles of money.
</P>
<P>
   In New York politics these days, Republicans are so strong in
the suburbs and upstate that, if they don't lose the city too
badly, victory in a statewide contest is near-certain. And, against
most Democrats, Giuliani would not lose the city too badly and
might even win it.
</P>
<P>
   The one Democrat who could put a hurdle in Giuliani's path to
glory is Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A statewide survey, taken last month by pollster John Zogby,
showed the first lady crushing any and all opponents in the
Democratic primary and running neck-and-neck with Giuliani in the
general election, beating the mayor in his own city and tying him
upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, she came here four times to campaign for Charles
Schumer in his Senate race against the Republican incumbent,
Alfonse D'Amato. Her speeches, at corporate luncheons and union
rallies alike, were smash hits.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, there is nothing stopping the first lady from
running. She would not have to move out of the White House, since
New York laws do not require candidates to live here.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is ``carpetbagger'' considered a loathsome term. ``New York
is not averse to welcoming outsiders,'' noted Maurice Carroll, head
of the Quinnipiac Polling Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Robert F. Kennedy, after all, successfully ran for Senate here,
though he had to fend off the tag of ``carpet bagger.'' James
Buckley did so without abandoning his home in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Like them, Hillary Rodham Clinton would have to establish
residency upon taking office, but her tenure in the White House
would be over by then, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, will she run? Her White House spokeswoman, Marsha
Berry, has dismissed such talk as ``speculation,'' though she has
not ruled it out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat with connections to the first lady dismissed the
notion completely. ``After she leaves the White House,'' the
Democrat said, ``she has no interest in doing anything that
involves the press or other politicians. She's sick of the whole
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   She might move to New York, the Democrat added, but more likely
to become a lawyer again or to run a corporation or foundation.
</P>
<P>
   According to author Gail Sheehy, who is writing a biography of
Hillary, the idea of a Senate-run may have originated with the
president. Last August, when the Clintons were in the Hamptons, the
first lady was greeted with such enthusiasm that the president
turned and said, ``Maybe she should run for office from here.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about as solid as the signposts get. Hope, who was among
the first to float the rumor, told the Daily News last week that
the first lady recently asked her not to do it anymore, calling
them ``a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   The fuel for the story's persistence may simply be its pipedream
appeal. New York Times columnist Bob Herbert stated it most baldly
last November. ``I have found nothing to substantiate the rumor
that Hillary Rodham Clinton is interested in running for Mr.
Moynihan's seat,'' he wrote. ``But the idea of a Senate race
between Mrs. Clinton and Rudy Giuliani is such a splendid one that
it must be kept alive at all costs.''

JOSE MOST POPULAR NAME IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Sub to correct other names throughout) 
(Eds.: Accent mark needed over i in Martin) 
 
By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ It's not Joseph or Joe or even Joey. No,
the most popular boy's name in Texas is Jose.
</P>
<P>
   In California, too, Jose tops the list as the most popular boy's
name on birth certificates for 1998. The Social Security
Administration reports that it's the first time ever a Latino name
has been No. 1, although the Texas Department of Health said Jose
led Texas' list in 1997 as well.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by high birth rates and steady immigration, Latinos are
expected to overtake African-Americans as the nation's largest
minority group by early next century.
</P>
<P>
   But the popularity of the name Jose may mean more than
demographic change, most of which can be traced to Mexico. Latinos
who name their children Jose are choosing not to name them Joe,
some experts say, suggesting a cultural affirmation. In past
decades, there seemed to be more pressure to assimilate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite clearly, in much of Latino society the feeling is that
the culture is established,'' said Edward Callary, professor of
English at Northern Illinois University and editor of the journal
of the American Name Society.
</P>
<P>
   One of San Antonio's newest Joses is Jose Loera, all 6 pounds, 7
ounces of him. Born to Mexican parents at Santa Rosa Hospital on
Jan. 10 about a month early, Jose was dealt his father's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Mexican,'' said his mother, Maria Loera, who named her
other sons Martin and Pablo. ``And for me, it's better to have a
Jose than a Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   The name Jose gets its popularity primarily from Catholic
iconography, St. Joseph, and Joseph, husband of Mary in the Bible,
which explains its prominence among people of Latin-American
descent.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, perhaps, no Maria can be found on either the Texas or
California top 10, nor can any other Latino girls' names. In Texas,
the No. 1 girl's name is Emily. In California, it's Jessica. Nor
are there any other Latino names on the top 10 list of names for
boys in either Texas or California.
</P>
<P>
   On the national level, no Latino name has yet to break the top
10. There, Michael holds sway for the boys, as it has for 35 years,
according to the San Francisco-based BabyCenter, an Internet site
that compiles such lists using Social Security Administration data.
Kaitlyn is No. 1 for girls.
</P>
<P>
   But ethnic names can be found on the list, such as Anthony and
Jacob, suggesting that over time immigrant names become American
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps, says Cecilia Munoz, vice president of policy for the
National Council for la Raza, a Washington-D.C. based Latino
advocacy group, the country is simply more comfortable with names
that are not your average Tom, Dick and Harry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The popularity of the name Jose may mean we're not as shy
about names that are distinct,'' Munoz said. ``But it certainly
reflects what we all know. The Latino community is growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to the anti-immigration feelings that have in part
defined the politics of the 1990s, Munoz fears a backlash against
the popularity of the name Jose. She recalled that presidential
contender Pat Buchanan used the name himself in his 1996
anti-illegal immigration pitch, promising to turn back ``Jose'' at
the border.
</P>
<P>
   While the name game clearly says something about who we are as a
society, and who we are becoming, not everyone agrees that the
latest rankings should be used as social-science data.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cultural statement,'' said Rodolfo de la Garza, vice
president of the University of Texas' Tomas Rivera Center, a Latino
issues think-tank. ``But it may or may not be associated with
assimilation.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Garza says there are too many variables to know. Even if
giving a child a Latino name is illustrative of assimilation, he
says, it's not entirely clear where the cultural affinity lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the thinking is, `I'm so American I can call my kid
Jose,''' said de la Garza. ``Or maybe it's, `I'm so Latino.'''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's both.
</P>
<P>
   Loera, the Mexican mom who just gave birth to Jose, named her
daughter Jackie, even though she favors Latino names for her sons.
Enriqueta Rabago, a San Antonio woman of Mexican descent, has two
sons, one Roberto and the other Patrick.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, Rabago suggested as she walked through San Antonio's
downtown bus station this week, the names reflect her binational
family. She is a U.S. citizen and her husband Mexican. Even so,
Patrick sounds more Irish than American. Call it the melting pot.
</P>
<P>
   While the popularity of Jose soars, other, more complicated
Latino names are long forgotten, de la Garza says. How about the
traditional Mexican name Agapito? Or Moctezuma? De la Garza says
these names are dying out among newcomers, and predicts that Jose
may too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name Jose has more in common with less educated Mexicans
who are looking for something traditional,'' said de la Garza. ``In
seven years, Jose will probably be Joey.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nancy Salinas, who serves barbecue at a downtown San
Antonio restaurant, has a 2-year old boy named Jose Felipe. A San
Antonian of several generations, she calls him Jose. What do his
aunts and uncles call him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Joey,'' she said.

 &HT;    First Union produces 34 percent increase in operating income
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ First Union reaped a big boost from tax planning and
from fee revenue and posted a 34 percent gain in fourth-quarter
operating income.
</P>
<P>
   The Charlotte, N.C.-based banking company, the nation's fifth
largest, reported Thursday that it earned $993 million, or $1 per
share, compared to 1997 income of $743 million, or 77 cents. Per
share income, which rose 30 percent, was a penny ahead of First
Call's consensus estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The stock closed at $61, off $1.43 3/4 on a down day for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made very smart moves,'' said Peter Kuper of Keefe,
Bruyette and Woods. The banking company ``saved $400 million in
taxes, amounting to about 40 cents a diluted share, from a
reorganization strategy that included the liquidation of a REIT. As
a result, their effective tax rate was about 3 percent while it's
normally about 36.5 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Net income, which includes merger and restructuring charges,
rose 49 percent to $857 million, or 87 cents, versus $576 million,
or 60 cents, in the last quarter of 1997. Pre-tax merger and
restructuring charges were $205 million and were mostly related to
the acquisition of CoreStates Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue grew 26 percent to $3.34 billion. Fee income jumped 46
percent, to $1.68 billion from $1.15 billion in the 1997 quarter.
In those fee-based lines of business, which includes mutual funds
and stock brokerage, grew 58 percent, to $471 million . Net
interest income, after loan loss provisions, was up 10 percent, to
$1.66 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company returned 1.7 percent on assets, versus a 1.37
percent average among banks over $25 billion in size. First Union
also reported a 22.6 percent return on equity versus an industry
average of 18.33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, First Union's operating income was $3.7 billion,
or $3.77 per share versus $2.91 billion, or $3.01 per share.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of December, First Union had assets of $237.36
billion.

 &HT;    Wachovia matches expectations
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In contrast to most of its peers, Wachovia compiled
strong loan growth and a higher interest rate margin to help
produce a 16.8 percent increase in fourth-quarter operating income.
</P>
<P>
   The Winston-Salem, N.C.-based banking company, the country's
17th largest, earned $246.2 million, or $1.19 per share, compared
to $210.7 million, or $1.02, in the fourth quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The per share earnings were in line with First Call's consensus
estimate. Wachovia closed at $87.50, down $1.93 3/4 on a bad day
for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Average loans grew $4.19 billion, or 10 percent, in the quarter,
net interest income rose 9.8 percent, to $525.6 million, and the
net interest rate margin, the difference between what money costs
and what it earns, widened to 4.28 percent from 4.21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wachovia has 4,000 midsize corporate customers, analyst Peter
Kuper of Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods said. ``The disruption from last
fall's economic crisis caused these companies to come to Wachovia
to get cheaper financing than they could from capital markets.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``almost every category of fee business posted a
gain'' in the quarter, Kuper said, citing credit cards and
electronic banking. Fee income rose 24.7 percent to $326.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Net income for the quarter, which includes merger and
restructuring charges, was $241.6 million, or $1.17 per share,
compared to $3.6 million, or 2 cents per share. The year-ago
results included merger-related charges.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1998, Wachovia had assets of $64.12 billion.

SUSPECTS IN CUBAN BOMBING CAMPAIGN SEEM FAR FROM HARDENED
TERRORISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY _ When terrorist bombs began exploding in Cuba
two years ago, speculation about the bombers' identities was
rampant. Coup-minded military officers, some Cuban exiles insisted.
Or right-wing infiltrators from Miami. A nascent rebel underground,
perhaps, supplied from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those theories help much to explain the role of
Jazid Ivan Fernandez, a 28-year-old data processor from Guatemala
City, who is one of five Central Americans now languishing in a
Cuban prison on charges stemming from the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, people who knew him in Guatemala said, was a punctual
if undistinguished bureaucrat, a pleasant young man who compiled
bus statistics for a government transport office. He devoted most
of his free time not to politics, they said, but to whatever
happened to be on television.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the accused saboteurs, assembled from interviews
with the five in the Havana prison and the accounts of their
relatives, associates and others in Central America, suggests that
even as radical Cuban exiles mounted their most intense campaign of
violence in years against the Communist government, their
operations were less cloak-and-dagger than cut-rate and lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``These do not appear to be militants or activists or
doctrinaire fanatics,'' said the Guatemalan Foreign Minister,
Eduardo Stein, who has studied the case. ``They seem to be
something like what, in the drug-trafficking world, one would call
mules.''
</P>
<P>
   The accused bombers were indeed anything but professional. Two
of the five had had brief experience as soldiers; a couple, at
least, thought vaguely ill of the Cuban government. But most
important to the cause was that all of them needed cash and were
struggling with debts on everything from cellular telephones to
children's schools.
</P>
<P>
   The most successful of the group, a 28-year-old Salvadoran who
needed money for car payments, earned $2,500. Another, an executive
at El Salvador's biggest car dealership who was struggling to
support two children he had fathered out of wedlock, agreed to make
the trip for $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly who paid the bills is unclear. An aging Cuban veteran of
the Central Intelligence Agency's crusades against Fidel Castro,
Luis Posada Carriles, acknowledged organizing the attacks,
suggesting that he did so with money provided by Cuban exiles in
the United States. But he declined to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said federal prosecutors are also looking at the
bombings as part of a grand jury investigation into what they say
was a plot to kill Castro during a regional summit meeting in the
Caribbean last May. They have filed conspiracy charges against
eight men, including three with ties to the most prominent exile
political group in the United States, the Cuban American National
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials have repeatedly accused the foundation and its
late former chairman, Jorge Mas Canosa, of orchestrating the
attacks, a charge it vigorously denies. But recently Cuba made the
charges more specific: in late October, the government asserted
that Posada's chief financier was Arnaldo Monzon, a wealthy
businessman from Fort Lee, N.J., who is a director of the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at his office above a clothing store in Union
City, N.J., just across the Hudson River from New York City, Monzon
dismissed the accusations as ridiculous. ``That was the first I had
heard of it,'' he said of the plot described by the Cuban Interior
Ministry. ``I don't think that is a way to overthrow a
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban security officials, speaking in interviews in which they
discussed many details of their investigations for the first time,
said they had already found traces of Monzon and other prominent
Cuban-Americans as the pattern of anti-Castro attacks began to
shift in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, said a senior official of the Interior Ministry's
counterintelligence directorate, Col. Adalberto Rabeiro, such
actions had typically been pirate raids on beachfront hotels,
incidents in which the attackers had fired off automatic weapons
from speedboats. Thereafter, the attackers grew bolder, aiming at
the tourist industry, a key source of foreign exchange since the
collapse of Cuba's trade with the former Soviet bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials allowed a reporter to interview the five
suspects now awaiting trial in Havana after Posada described his
role in the attacks in articles published last summer in The New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews were conducted at the Interior Ministry's Villa
Marista prison, in a room that appeared to be monitored by security
agents. All five of the prisoners admitted the crimes of which they
have been accused and denied having been mistreated or coerced to
do so. But several were held incommunicado for months, and though
much of their accounts was corroborated by friends, relatives,
employers and associates, it was impossible to tell whether parts
of their stories might have been rehearsed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials said the five were only the last in a recent
series of attackers trained abroad. Two of the first, they said,
were young Cuban emigres trained in Miami and dropped back on the
island in 1995 with 51 pounds of plastic explosives. They and two
other exiles who entered Cuba with a small quantity of explosives
in 1996, were arrested before they could blow up anything, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, 1997, however, a bomb exploded at the discotheque
in Havana's newest five-star hotel, the Melia Cohiba, and another
was found unexploded weeks later. Cuban officials said this marked
the start of Posada's more direct management of the sabotage, a
wave of 13 bombings that would unsettle Cuba for months.
</P>
<P>
   As his first mercenary, Cuban officials said, Posada hired
Francisco Chavez Abarca, a 29-year-old Salvadoran whose father, a
well-connected arms dealer, he had met after arriving in El
Salvador in 1985 to work for the National Security Council's
operation to supply Nicaraguan contra rebels. That year Posada
escaped from a Venezuelan prison where he had been held on charges
of plotting the bombing of a Cuban airliner in 1976 in which 73
people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   How Chavez made his living is unclear. But to the young men who
hung around him, the Fat Man, as they called him, had the trappings
of small-time underworld success: a used BMW, spending money, a
semi-automatic handgun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him at one point, `Look Francisco, I'm sure you're
mixed up in the drug business,''' said one of those young men, Raul
Cruz Leon. ```When you've got a job, remember me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such activities were out of character for Cruz Leon, but his
finances were getting desperate. His main job, driving for Latin
pop singers as the ``security chief'' for a Salvadoran promoter,
rarely paid more than $500 a month. Between car payments,
credit-card bills and his cellular phone, he owed nearly $6,000,
and relatives said his mother finally mortgaged her small jewelry
store to help him pay off the debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was drowning in the interest payments,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz Leon was clearly something less than the hardened military
veteran that Cuban officials suggested and that many news accounts
have described.
</P>
<P>
   The son and grandson of army veterans, he had dreamed of
entering the Salvadoran military academy, a well-traveled social
escalator for boys from the working class. But he had also studied
at the Jesuits' Central American University and said he was
troubled by the military's killing of six priests there in 1989.
Within a year of entering the academy, he rose almost to the top
rank of his class _ and then dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   When Chavez approached him about ``a little job'' in late 1996,
he said, he agreed immediately. When Chavez told him later that he
wanted to set off small bombs at Havana hotels, Cruz Leon said he
suspected some dispute with a hotel owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of that movie `The Specialist,' with Sylvester
Stallone and Sharon Stone,'' Cruz Leon recalled, looking pale and
tired in a blue-polyester prison uniform. ``That guy planted a
bomb, and he ended up a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz Leon became the most able of the accused mercenaries,
learning to assemble his bombs _ a small wad of plastic explosive,
a detonator, a thin Casio alarm clock and a nine-volt battery _ in
little more than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who is said by associates to still be living in San
Salvador, El Salvador, appears from travel and telephone records
obtained from the Cuban authorities to have been in Cuba when the
Maria Cohiba hotel was bombed on April 12. Cruz Leon followed him
in July, getting past a strip search at the Havana airport to bomb
two hotels for $2,500. He was arrested during a second trip in
September, after another of his bombs killed a 32-year-old Italian
businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Posada said he was unperturbed. ``He's not Cuban,'' he said in
the interview, referring to Cruz Leon. ``He did this for money.''
</P>
<P>
   But as attention focused on El Salvador after those attacks,
Posada turned to Guatemala, where he recruited a pair of young men
to plant two more bombs in August 1997. Guatemalan newspapers
reported that one of those men, Marlon Gonzalez, 31, and another
man were found in a dump truck last May, badly beaten and shot to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez apparently found his most unlikely recruits in late 1997
at the Guatemala City guest house of Maria Elena Gonzalez, a
54-year-old former school teacher, who read tarot cards on the
side.
</P>
<P>
   In a prison interview in Havana, Mrs. Gonzalez said Chavez had
come to her because she knew a woman he wanted to kill, apparently
on contract, to retaliate for the murder of a wealthy Salvadoran
businessman. He spent days having his cards read and hanging about
at her pink-plaster home where, coincidentally, the Cuban patriot
Jose Marti had once lived.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban security officials suggested that some of their main
evidence against Monzon came from Chavez's card readings. In two
interviews, Mrs. Gonzalez said he had told her he was owed money by
three men, two of whom he named as Arnaldo Monzon and Ramon Medina,
an alias used in El Salvador by Posada. She said she had also taken
a telephone message for Chavez from a caller who identified himself
as ``the man from New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Chavez recruited another of Mrs. Gonzalez's sometime
guests, Nader Musalam, a 28-year-old Guatemalan who had previously
owned a small store where, he said, he had done a modest business
in stolen clothing. He had gone to Cuba on vacation years earlier;
although the bombs seemed like ``not such a good idea,'' he was
eager to get back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked it a lot,'' he said. ``It wasn't like they made it
sound in Guatemala.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the deal he said he made with Chavez, Musalam was
to receive $1,300 for each bomb he planted, enough for a down
payment on a Hyundai sedan that he could drive as a taxi. For $800,
Mrs. Gonzalez said, she agreed to carry two toothpaste tubes filled
with plastic explosives and two small alarm clocks. But she also
had to pay for own plane ticket, which she bought on credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the end of the month,'' she said. ``I had to pay the
water bill, the electricity bill. I thought this would be some
quick money.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Musalam was arrested at the airport, and Mrs. Gonzalez was
picked up as she waited for him at his hotel. Mrs. Gonzalez's
husband, Jazid Ivan Fernandez, 28, the data processor, said he had
opposed the trip but helped pack the explosives. He was detained
three weeks later when he traveled to Cuba to try to locate her.
</P>
<P>
   With his sabotage network first starting to fray in 1997, Posada
_ who acknowledged before the Cuban government's announcement that
three of his bombers had been captured _ became more directly
involved. A retired Salvadoran Air Force captain, Alberto Barraza,
whom Posada had known from the contra operation, said in an
interview that he introduced him to Otto Rene Rodriguez, supposedly
to buy inexpensive ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Barraza disavowed any knowledge of the Cuba plot. He said
Rodriguez bought lots of ammunition because of his job as the
security supervisor for a Salvadoran company that includes the
country's biggest car dealership, a position in which he supervised
more than 200 guards and other employees. Rodriguez, 40, had also
spent time at the Gerardo Barrios military academy, leaving early
to attend architecture school. And he too was in financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a prosperous businessman and the nephew of one of El
Salvador's most respected centrist politicians, Otto Rodriguez
earned just under $1,000 a month at the dealership. But along with
his two children by his estranged wife, he said, he was trying to
support two more by other women with whom he had become involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``With $1,000 I could solve my problem,'' he said. ``And I
thought I could keep some of the expense money they gave me.''
</P>
<P>
   He arrived at the Havana airport in August 1997, carrying the
explosives in a back pocket, the transistor batteries in a front
pocket. He planted a bomb at the Maria Cohiba, had a brief affair
with a young Cuban woman and returned home to pay off his elder
children's school tuition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After agreeing to try again, he was arrested at the Havana
airport last June. This time he was supposed to meet a Cuban
conspirator, identified to him only as Juan. Instead, he has spent
the last months wondering why he ever agreed to join Posada's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really doesn't have anything to do with us,'' he said of
the plot to destabilize the Cuban government. ``Sometimes, it takes
a long time to figure out how lost you are.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In laying out their case of perjury and obstruction
of justice against President Clinton Thursday, the House managers
regularly invoked federal statutes designed to give prosecutors the
widest possible leeway in determining whether to charge someone
with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., who detailed the obstruction case
against the president, began his presentation by saying that, ``The
evidence will show there was a scheme developed to obstruct the
administration of justice and that is illegal,'' language taken in
part from the federal criminal code.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is that language written more broadly than in the
statute dealing with obstruction of justice. Criminal law experts
said it can allow prosecutors to bring charges on only a suggestion
that someone tried to interfere with a court proceeding. With that
leeway, the Republicans on Thursday offered a wide-ranging
narrative of various actions by the president which, taken
together, they said, should persuade the Senate that Clinton tried
to foil the workings of both a federal grand jury and the sexual
misconduct trial of Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction statutes referred to Thursday by Rep. James
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who provided an overview of the case,
include, for example, one law known as the ``Omnibus Provision.''
</P>
<P>
   It allows for charging someone who, by any communication,
``endeavors to influence, obstruct or impede the administration of
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Roscoe C. Howard Jr., a former federal prosecutor who teaches
criminal justice at the University of Kansas, said that the law's
standards are vague enough to allow a prosecutor to bring any
charge anytime where there is even only a suggestion of an adverse
impact on the court system.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson detailed seven acts, any one of which the Republicans
assert could amount to an obstruction scheme. They include charges
that Clinton persuaded Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit for
the Jones lawsuit; discussed a cover story to conceal their
relationship; tried to conceal the gifts they exchanged; got her a
job to buy her cooperation; allowed his attorney to make false
statements to the judge in the Jones case; tried to ``corruptly
influence'' the testimony of his secretary, Betty Currie, and lied
to his close aides so they could spread his false denials.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela H. Bucy, a former federal prosecutor who teaches criminal
law at the University of Alabama Law School, said statutes like the
one on obstruction are intentionally written to afford prosecutors
great leeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have broadly drawn statutes because people who
engage in obstruction of justice are generally very creative, very
clever at achieving their ends,'' she said. In recent years
Congress even amended the obstruction laws to make it easier to
deal with cases like that involving Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky.
Before the 1988 change, courts were obliged to throw out
convictions for obstruction in cases where someone had merely asked
another to lie in his or her behalf but did not offer any threats
or inducements to do so.
</P>
<P>
   That might have covered any conversations between Clinton and
Ms. Lewinsky, since any effort to conceal their relationship was
probably mutual.
</P>
<P>
   But the section of the law that deals with influencing a
witness' testimony was changed so that one could be charged just
for ``corruptly persuading,'' rather than coercing, another person
to tell a lie in a court proceeding, a phrase also used by the
managers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Bucy said that the broadness of the statute carries with
it an obligation on the prosecutor for some finely honed
discretion. Prosecutors, she said, are entitled to conclude that
someone's action might technically meet the elements of a criminal
law but are not worthy of prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Clinton, she said it could be argued that
whatever efforts he made to conceal the Lewinsky relationship were
aimed at avoiding embarrassment and not to foil the workings of the
criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers, for their part, have put forward a two-track
defense that they will begin making before the Senate next week.
They have argued that the elements are unproven, that is, there are
other explanations for each of the seven actions Hutchinson
outlined.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in their filings with the Senate they have
claimed that the offenses, even if true, do not rise to the level
of an impeachable offense.

NIXON HEADED FOR OUTFIELD AT FENWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He has been on the Red Sox' list of coming attractions
for so long that people forgot to be excited when Trot Nixon
finally showed up. Or maybe they just gave up on the idea he'd ever
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a new outfielder in town, and while it may seem that
Nixon took a left turn somewhere on the road to Yawkey Way, the
rookie's timing may be just right. The last time the Red Sox were
this desperate for a lefthanded hitter, Mo Vaughn was still the big
man on campus at Seton Hall.
</P>
<P>
   And it bears repeating. Though he first appeared on the Sox'
radar screen as a No. 1 draft choice in 1993, a year before Nomar
Garciaparra was picked, Nixon, who turns 25 April 11, is nine
months younger than the shortstop. His gestation period may have
been longer than Garciaparra's, and his coming of age less
heralded, but Nixon is intent on being noticed now that the door to
the Sox clubhouse has swung wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to hit .280-.300, hit 20-plus home runs, have 20 stolen
bases,'' Nixon said while fretting that Thursday's snowstorm would
keep his broadcaster wife, Kathryn, from flying back to Charlotte,
N.C., to receive an award for a piece she did on women's drag
racing for ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Darren Bragg a lot. He was a good friend in the time I
was here, and I'm happy he signed with the Cardinals,'' Nixon added
at Thurdsay night's Boston Baseball Writers Dinner at Hynes
Auditorium, where he was honored as the Sox' top minor leaguer of
1998. ``But with him leaving, that opens an opportunity for me and
for other players. I plan to go to spring training with the
mentality that I have to win a job and I want to keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragg, who had been a part of Jimy Williams's rotating outfield,
was not offered a contract after hitting .279 last season while
making 102 starts in right field. The decision not to bring Bragg
back was in part economic; he was eligible for arbitration, meaning
his salary could have jumped close to the $1 million range. But
Nixon also entered into the equation; after a breakthrough season
in Pawtucket, in which he batted .310 with 23 home runs and 26
stolen bases, plus a strong showing after his September call-up,
Sox general manager Dan Duquette and Williams decided that he was a
preferable (and cheaper) alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Consider his words, and the way he looks you in the eye when he
delivers them, and it's obvious that Nixon is in full agreement
with that judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first goal is to be part of winning games here,'' he said.
``I'll do anything to win games _ get drilled by a ball, drag a
bunt, beat out a single, hit a home run _ I'll do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot's happened here. Mo's gone. I'm not trying to fill Mo's
shoes, but I want to be part of a winning tradition. If I play
every day, I have a shot at my goals _ hitting .280-.300, 15-20
home runs. I don't want to set goals where I reach 'em, then level
off, but I don't want to set them too high, either.''
</P>
<P>
   If talking in such terms places extra pressure on Nixon, so be
it. ``I saw what Nomar did his rookie year,'' said the North
Carolina native. ``I can't say I'll do that, but I think I could
have a shot at Rookie of the Year if I play every day. I may not be
one of the top candidates, but I don't see why I can't have a
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially now that he apparently is fully recovered from the
back problems that plagued him earlier in his career, and after
blossoming under the tutelage last summer of Gerald Perry, the
Pawtucket hitting instructor and former big leaguer whose
assistance was invaluable, Nixon says.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon had an inarticulate fracture in his lower back. ``I just
had to let it heal,'' he said. He says his back still acts up at
times, but not to the point where it's debilitating. ``I played
through a lot last year,'' he said. ``I got hit by a pitch in the
elbow and my whole elbow blew up, but I played through that.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Nixon hit just .244 for Pawtucket, and while he
was in big league camp last spring, he was never considered a
candidate to make the club. This spring Duquette has already
anointed him as the leading choice to start in right field. That's
one reason Nixon plans to join Garciaparra for a month of workouts
at the Bollettieri fitness camp in Bradenton, Fla., just before
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what it's like to be down,'' Nixon said, ``but I also
know how to get back up.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Democrats and Republicans, who sat silently
in their chamber seats at the opening of President Clinton's
impeachment trial Thursday, resumed their verbal brawl off the
Senate floor over whether to call witnesses, imperiling a fragile
bipartisan pact.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of
double-crossing them by directing a small group of Republican
senators to meet secretly with the House prosecutors and help them
devise criteria for determining whether witnesses would be called.
</P>
<P>
   All 100 senators agreed last Friday to postpone a vote on
whether to call witnesses until later this month, after
presentations from the House managers and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans shot back that Democrats had deliberately
rebuffed a belated invitation to join the talks as part of a
strategy to sharpen the partisan divide over witnesses and to paint
the Republican-controlled Senate as being as hostile as the House
is toward Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The witness issue remained central. Even as the House managers
wove appeals to permit witnesses throughout their oral arguments to
the senators Thursday, they made the same point in a detailed
rebuttal to the trial memorandum that the White House filed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that the president's trial memorandum ``raises
issues of credibility, those issues are best resolved by live
testimony subject to cross-examination,'' the House brief said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had no comment Thursday on the impeachment trial. Aides
said he spent much of the day working on his State of the Union
address, which he plans to deliver next Tuesday. But White House
press secretary Joe Lockhart was on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the founders intended a party that is in the
majority in the Congress could remove a president at their whim
based on partisan political differences,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized a suggestion by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the
head of the House prosecution team, that Clinton testify. ``I think
this late-hour request from Henry Hyde just once again illustrates
that this is really about politics,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever frail cooperative spirit created from last Friday's
unusual joint caucus seemed to be hanging by a thread, especially
after some Democrats also assailed Republicans for acting
complicitly in the House managers' decision this week to approach
two potential witnesses, Monica Lewinsky and Kathleen Willey, about
their possible testimony.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-hour party caucus that broke up shortly before
Thursday's opening arguments, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle
criticized the Republican-only meetings. ``It certainly violates
the spirit of the agreement we all agreed to last week,'' said
Daschle, who ordered Democrats to boycott the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., voiced concern that the Republican
meetings could undermine the Senate's earnest attempts to avoid the
clashes that split the House. ``This could lead to our making the
same awful mistakes that the House made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans defended both the meetings with the House
managers and the prosecutors' decision to set up informal talks
with Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Willey, the senators who met with the
prosecutors were divided over whether the gatherings should
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tempest in teapot, and I consider it over,'' said
Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., to reporters. ``I don't think there's
any further need to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sessions said the senators, including Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and
Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., made clear to the House managers that they needed
to winnow their wish list of 15 witnesses, and focus on those
witnesses who could resolve conflicting testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But Specter said in an interview that the House prosecutors'
opening arguments only underscored the need for witnesses, and that
the small Senate group would likely meet again with the House
managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be more meetings in the future,'' Specter
said during a break in the trial. ``My view is that there ought to
be standards, not only on the witnesses, but also on the scope of
their testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   With the prevailing wisdom that the Senate will not muster the
67 votes required by the Constitution to remove Clinton, the
question of whether to call witnesses is emerging as a more
divisive issue than acquittal or conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over in their 33-page filing, the House prosecutors
flatly dismissed the White House's efforts to explain away the
allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice leveled against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton's attorneys raise the issue of fairness,''
the House memo stated. ``They are entitled to their own opinion
about the House's proceedings, but they are not entitled to rewrite
history. The truth is that the committee's subpoena power could
have been used to subpoena documents or witnesses on behalf of the
president if they had so requested. They did not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All they requested, is that the lawyers, law professors and
historians testify before the committee,'' the memo continued. ``In
short, President Clinton's statements about what happened in the
House completely misstate what occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   The House managers concluded by urging the Senate to proceed to
a full trial, convict Clinton and remove him from office.

&HT;        WATCHDOG GROUP PUSHES TO EXPAND SHUSTER PROBE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 -- A government watchdog group called for
the House ethics committee to expand its investigation into Rep.
Bud Shuster.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent Thursday to the committee, Ann McBride,
president of Common Cause, asked the committee to investigate new
allegations from court documents filed in Boston that Shuster,
R-Everett, accepted lodging and dinners from lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   But it's unclear how the committee will respond to the new
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee will not even meet until next week,'' said Ted
Van Der Meid, chief counsel to the committee formally known as the
House Standards of Official Conduct (Ethics) Committee. ``There
have been no developments or changes in the Shuster investigation
and it won't be discussed until they meet.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee announced last month that it had reopened an
investigation into Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Common Cause, which focuses on campaign finance
reform and government ethics, had urged the committee to
investigate whether Shuster's relationship with his former chief of
staff Ann Eppard, who became a transportation lobbyist, benefited
her clients.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's investigation of Shuster had been suspended
because of a pending criminal investigation in Boston, including a
federal grand jury's indictment of Eppard for her role in that
city's $10 billion ``Big Dig'' highway project.
</P>
<P>
   McBride cited documents filed recently in Boston that outline
charges that two businessmen and the lobbyist working for them
provided Shuster and Eppard with lodging and dinners that violated
a House gift ban, which were revealed this week by a Capitol Hill
publication, Roll Call. The documents also say that Shuster failed
to report the gifts on his financial disclosure reports.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster's office did not return phone calls.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate listened to the case for her
husband's removal from office Thursday, Hillary Rodham Clinton's
mind was a world away _ on Mars, to be precise.
</P>
<P>
   Under a panorama of the Martian landscape in the planetarium at
the National Air and Space Museum, Mrs. Clinton unveiled a program
called the Mars Millennium Project through which schoolchildren
will develop plans for how a colony on the red planet would
function.
</P>
<P>
   ``It Takes a Village'' meets ``The Martian Chronicles.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not just his wife who was taking a page from the playbook
of the compartmentalizer in chief as the impeachment proceedings
against President Clinton unfolded on Capitol Hill and on
television screens throughout Washington.
</P>
<P>
   George Black, one of the five members of the National
Transportation Safety Board, and an expert in highway safety, said,
``I'm watching the weather channel.''
</P>
<P>
   As the weather here switched from rain to freezing rain and back
to rain, Black said, ``I'm trying to figure out whether to sleep in
the office or drive home.''
</P>
<P>
   Black, a Republican appointed by Clinton, said he had not found
time to watch the impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We at the safety board have a lot of things to do,'' he said,
including work on major unsolved air crashes. ``I am totally
immersed in reading dockets and technical reports.''
</P>
<P>
   From the bowels of the bureaucracy to the highest reaches of the
political class, work went on, but with an occasional halt to view
what jaded Washingtonians seemed to be straining to view as
history. Even as televised drama, it did not seem to measure up to
Sam Ervin listening to John Dean _ or Marcia Clark questioning Kato
Kaelin, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is quite different from Watergate,'' said Richard A.
Steinwurtzel, a partner at the law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris,
Shriver &AMP; Jacobson. Steinwurtzel had summer jobs in the government
while he was in law school during the Senate Watergate hearings and
the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment proceedings against
Richard Nixon. ``During Watergate, all the TVs were on, and we were
hanging on every word.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Squier, a Democratic strategist who worked for Clinton, said
the television in his office was not working properly, so he walked
home to watch, tuned in ``and promptly fell asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe it?'' he said. ``The president I helped get
elected is on trial for impeachment, and I can't stay awake.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the offices of Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel,
the televisions were on. ``People are popping in and out and taking
a look at it,'' said a staff member who insisted on anonymity.
``But no one is glued to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the proceedings varied, unsurprisingly, by political
conviction. Bill Pascoe, the political director for the American
Conservative Union, was watching the trial at his home office in
Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm watching it for the same reason you watch a car race _ you
keep watching in the morbid hope that someone is going to wipe out
in the fourth turn,'' he said. ``It's compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the Clinton administration, predictably, there was a
concerted effort not just to get on with the people's work but to
be seen as getting on with the people's work.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had lunch with Vice President Al Gore _ no talk of
impeachment there, Gore's aides said _ and worked on his State of
the Union address. Late in the day Clinton canceled a trip to New
York because of the wintry weather.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre reported
that the military was going all out to insure that software
problems associated with the year 2000 would not imperil national
security. The State Department proposed loosening restrictions on
oil sales by Iraq. The Department of Housing and Urban Development
unveiled a plan to help businesses in poor communities create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the time or the inclination to watch this
stuff,'' said David C. Leavy, the spokesman for the National
Security Council, who said his television was not on. ``All my
colleagues on NSC are focused on the hard work of Iraq and Kosovo
and international economic issues and others. Even if I wanted to
watch, I don't have the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of his colleagues were quite so pure, with some stealing
glances at television sets that were tuned to the proceedings,
albeit with the sound turned down.
</P>
<P>
   And at the Justice Department and the FBI, some employees
admitted to having tuned in, curious about a proceeding far
different from their criminal and civil trials in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   One FBI official said Thursday's proceeding seemed devoid of new
information, but was interesting as a piece of history. ``It's
pretty awesome.'' he said.

ANNAN PROPOSES REMOVING UN PEACEKEEPERS FROM ANGOLA 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Marking a dramatic setback in its decade-long
effort to bring stability to Angola, the UN chief's top aides have
recommended pulling out the UN peacekeeping forces from the central
African state as intense fighting between government and rebel
forces resumes, senior UN officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary General Kofi Annan is to make the final decision on
the withdrawal in a report to Security Council Friday. Sources said
that in the face of mounting pressure from the US, Russia and
several Africa states to maintain a UN presence in the country,
Annan is likely to dramatically scale back the peacekeeping
mission, leaving a much smaller UN presence.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's chief envoy to Angola, Issa Diallo, recommended that the
UN peacekeeping force be withdrawn in the wake of the recent
downing of two UN cargo planes and heavy shelling in key cities in
the central highlands. And the UN's top peacekeeping official,
Bernard Miyet of France, told UN staffers in a closed door meeting
that he could no longer guarantee the safety of UN personnel in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the fighting continues, there is no point to
keeping our peacekeeping forces there,'' a UN source said,
requesting anonymity. ``There may be a political role in helping
the parties to get back on the path toward a settlement, and we
will have to do all we can to provide humanitarian assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said Thursday that the UN's continued
presence in Angola is essential to achieving a political
settlement. ``We recognize that there is a very legitimate concern
for security,'' said White House national security spokesman P.J.
Crowley. ``From our standpoint, (the UN peacekeeping mission's)
presence is essential to any hope of resurrecting the peace
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan had made no final decision as of Thursday evening, and any
decisions on the UN's future in Angola must first be approved by
the Security Council. There appeared little resolve for a total
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   According to a UN official, Miyet said that African ambassadors
meeting at the United Nations on Tuesday voiced concern that the
international body ``was abandoning Angola.'' Miyet said those
concerns ``were shared'' by Russia, the United States and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   A UN withdrawal from Angola would come at a time when the vast
middle of the African continent is collapsing. The five-month war
in Congo, which has drawn in at least six outside forces, is sowing
unrest in several neighboring states. Renewed fighting in Angola is
a direct result of the conflict in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats are reluctant to abandon a four-year-old
accord in Angola, saying it still represents the shortest path to
peace. But most now admit that the fighting parties in that
country, as well as those in Congo, have not yet found the
political will to contest their differences around the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``There still needs to be some sobering in Congo,'' says Chester
Crocker, a former US assistant secretary of state for African
affairs. ``The warring parties will have to learn their limits
before they'll cut a deal. And since Angola is a result of the war
in Congo, until we know how Congo is going to shake down, we can't
see how to go forward in Angola.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of low-level bush battles, Angola returned to war
in early December, when the government launched an offensive
against rebel strongholds in the central highlands. That territory
was due to be handed over to government control as part of the 1995
Lusaka Protocols, a plan to demilitarize the warring factions and
form a government of national unity. The rebel movement, the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), has
responded with repeated attacks on several key cities.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations was forced to suspend humanitarian operations
into the hinterland after two C-130 cargo planes were shot down on
Dec. 26 and Jan. 2. A total of 23 people were killed in the
actions, including a South African man piloting the first downed
aircraft and his son, who boarded the second plane while searching
for his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``With regard to the downing of the UN planes, even the most
basic rules governing the conduct of war are being overlooked,''
said Aziz Pahad, South Africa's deputy foreign minister. He blamed
UNITA for both incidents; others haven't dismissed the possibility
that the government may be to blame for one of the wreckages. The
World Food Program resumed aid flights only Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Angola has endured nearly 35 years of war since the mid-1960s.
Infrastructure throughout the country is shattered. The economy is
a shambles: Despite its abundant natural resources, including vast
oil and diamond reserves, Angola imports nearly everything it
consumes. The resumption of fighting has already displaced
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council must decide what presence to maintain in
Angola before Feb. 26, when the mission's current mandate ends. The
decision to withdraw its 1,000 peace monitors would be painful. The
mission in Angola is one of the UN's longest-running peacekeeping
operation and at one point was its largest. Since 1989 it has
poured more than $1.5 billion into solving the country's conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot leave by the back door at midnight on the pretext
that we have no security for our people,'' said Diallo on
Wednesday. ``We have to show that we'll assist in humanitarian
terms and on the political side.''
</P>
<P>
   But few close to the peace process express hope that new
political initiatives can be found to stop the fighting. ``There's
a sense that no one wants to abandon the people to another two
years of war. But with neither side talking, there'll have to be
some kind of resolution on the battlefield,'' said one diplomat in
Luanda.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate sat utterly mute and passive as it began
its trek into the familiar details of the nation's oft-told tale of
the president and the intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate now finds itself in the midst of the tempest,'' the
100-member impeachment jury was told by one of the House
prosecutors. And, truly, an eye-of-the-storm calm had already
settled about the lawmakers in eerie contrast to the previous 12
months of scandalous sensation and accusation that frayed the
nation so incessantly.
</P>
<P>
   A patient sort of attentiveness settled over the Senate once the
team of House prosecutors began making it clear that the case for
banishing President Clinton involved no new factual details or
disputations that the senators, like the nation, were not already
steeped bone-deep in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Witnesses are essential to give heightened credence,'' Rep.
James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., finally admitted to the Senate jury.
He seemed concerned even in the first hour of the argument that
mere repetition was not enough to make the oft-told tale a sharp
enough weapon for deposing Clinton. The congressman was pleading
the House accusers' crucial hope for a fresh array of first-person
characters to revivify the impeachment case and give it traction in
this ultimate test.
</P>
<P>
   For sensation, the gallery audience had to settle for the simple
image of the senators sitting monkishly in collective silence. It
was signal enough that something different and perhaps final might
be in the air. ``To sit for seven hours and not talk is an
unnatural act for a U.S. Senator,'' admitted Sen. Max Cleland,
D-Ga., during a break.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers busily took notes, others listened with no pad at
hand. The president's defense lawyers sat on the Republican side at
an arc-shaped table. The House Republican prosecutors settled in
similarly over on the Democrats' side of the chamber, once the
politicians finished their informal glad-handing, back-patting and
nice-to-see-yous, an indispensable ritual even with the president's
fate on the line.
</P>
<P>
   As the opening arguers wended deeper into the day and the case's
redundancy, fewer notes were taken. For all the carefully prepared
argumentation, the skein of silence fallen so uncharacteristically
upon the talkative body remained remarkable. How long might the
nation, let alone the senators, tolerate such nonjudgmental
discretion being lavished at last upon the oft-told tale?
</P>
<P>
   At the three-hour mark, news workers in the press gallery
speculated that at least two of the senators seated so glumly below
might have slipped into either some deeper level of rumination upon
the case than their colleagues had achieved, or perchance into
brief, involuntary and ultimately self-alarming catnaps at their
desk.
</P>
<P>
   Such refreshment seemed defensible to some onlookers in the
chamber as the prosecutors dutifully tolled once more through those
21 encounters around the Oval Office, the job search, the
finger-wagging presidential denial before the nation. After the
furious search across the past year for the dress, the gifts and
those smoking tapes, the media watch, finally at the bar, was
focusing on which juror might be betraying evidence of boredom with
it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to inform members of the Senate and the parties
in this case of my need to stand on occasion to stretch my back,''
the presiding officer, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, informed
the body at the outset, as if signaling the nation as much as the
jury that a certain tedium might be at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Untoward moments were the day's premium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trial began on a cold day in January, 1993,'' another
prosecutor, Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., announced, cueing a tape
recording for a passing moment of relief. The president's voice
boomed into the chamber with his first inaugural oath's vow to
uphold the laws of the land. Heads snapped up, but the sound bite
ended quickly, nipping out most of the inaugural crowd's long and
strong applause of a popular president.
</P>
<P>
   The senators streamed at midday from their offices to their
taciturn jury duty via the tunnel network under the Capitol that
shielded them from an icy rainstorm. Some talked nonstop on cell
phones, others paused at a soda machine to give brief interviews to
reporters foiling the security-heavy corridors upstairs closer to
the Senate chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John B. Breaux, D-La., juggled two briefing books, one on
the trial, the other on the Mardi Gras visit next week of 2,000
constituents. ``We're going to be challenged to prove that we can
be serious and have a good time at the same time,'' Breaux said,
clearly yearning for carnival.
</P>
<P>
   Across more than five hours of denunciation of the president by
the prosecutors, his defense lawyers only listened. They never
dared to object in the chamber's ceremonial atmosphere to anything
the other side said, including the Republicans' eager appropriation
of ``stone-walling'' and other echoes of Watergate. Then, too, the
jury gave no sign of being impressed one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking antibiotics for a cold and it's tough as hell to
stay awake,'' Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, admitted at the day's
final break, with untold days more of silent senatorial jury duty
still to come.

PROSECUTORS WILL FOCUS FRIDAY ON PERJURY, OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House prosecutors will summarize the evidence
against President Clinton and outline the laws of perjury and
obstruction of justice Friday when the Senate impeachment trial
resumes.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the arguments will be Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., who
has been assigned to mesh the facts that his fellow prosecutors
presented Thursday with the federal statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Assisting McCollum will be Republican Reps. George W. Gekas of
Pennsylvania, Steve Chabot of Ohio, Christopher Cannon of Utah and
Bob Barr of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors have 24 hours over three days to make their
case.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum, 54, a conservative who has been an articulate
spokesmen for the Republican Party, is a senior member of the House
Judiciary Committee and chairman of its subcommittee on crime.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his 18th year as a House member, McCollum was a
prosecutor, judge and defense lawyer in the Navy. He was also an
attorney in private practice for eight years, focusing on insurance
issues.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 he co-chaired a joint congressional panel that
investigated the FBI's role in the standoff between federal
officials and the Branch Davidian sect outside Waco, Texas, that
resulted in the death of about 80 Davidians. Earlier, he was on the
congressional panel that investigated the Iran-Contra affair. That
probe involved the Ronald Reagan administration's arms sales to
Iran and use of the money to supply covert aid to the Contra rebels
in Nicaragua when Congress had forbidden such aid.
</P>
<P>
   Gekas, 68, who will provide an overview of the perjury and
obstruction of justice articles of impeachment, is a former
assistant district attorney for Dauphin County, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   He served as the lead House prosecutor in the Senate's 1989
impeachment trial of former U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings, who
was convicted of conspiring to obtain a bribe and lying to gain
acquittal in an earlier trial. Hastings later bounced back and is
now a Democratic House member from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Chabot, 45, who will present a detailed look at the crime of
perjury, grew up in a blue-collar neighborhood of Cincinnati and
worked nights in a gas station to pay tuition at a Catholic high
school there. He later worked in a steel factory while attending
William &AMP; Mary College on a football scholarship. He practiced law
in Cincinnati for 15 years and served on the city council.
</P>
<P>
   Cannon, 48, who will focus on the law against obstruction of
justice, is a millionaire industrialist who flunked out of Harvard
Business School before getting his law degree. In the 1980s he was
appointed by Reagan as associate solicitor in the Interior
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, 50, who will wrap up Friday's prosecution case, is a
former CIA agent and served as a U.S. attorney for the northern
district of Florida from 1986 to 1990. In Congress he has been a
leading opponent of same-sex marriage and of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the first member of Congress to call publicly for
Clinton's impeachment. This week Barr was targeted by Hustler
magazine publisher Larry Flynt, who accused the twice-divorced
congressman of cheating on his second wife, pressing her to get an
abortion and paying for the procedure. Barr denied he had
encouraged the abortion and refused to discuss Flynt's other
charges.

MASSACHUSETTTS SETTLES AGE-BIAS CASE AGAINST BULL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination has
approved an agreement settling a four-year-old complaint charging
Bull HN Information Systems with a pattern of widespread age
discrimination in employee layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement between the company and the Attorney General
Scott Harshbarger's office requires, among other things, that Bull
notify 2,000 former employees of future job vacancies and give them
an opportunity to apply. The former employees, all over 40, were
part of a string of layoffs conducted from 1990 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement should serve as model for other private
companies in the state and throughout the nation for protecting the
rights of older workers, especially when a company is downsizing,''
Harshbarger said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Bull HN was unavailable for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Billerica, Mass. high-tech conglomerate is the US
counterpart of France's government supported company, Groupe Bull.
The Massachusetts firm includes the former Honeywell electronics
company, and also has a manufacturing division in Brighton.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement stems from a 1995 complaint brought by the
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that Bull HN abanonded its seniority policy in
1990,'' said Assist. Attorney General Cathy Ziehl, director of the
Employment Discrimination Project. ``When the company abandoned
that policy, the statistics on older workers went South and that is
where we began to see statistically significant increases in the
number people over 40 who were laid off.''
</P>
<P>
   A separate complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission by former employees is pending. It accuses Bull HN of
allegedly instituting an illegal plan in which older workers waived
their right to sue the company in lieu of severance pay, but did
not receive extra compensation as required under the Older Worker
Benefit Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement approved Thursday and signed on Wednesday,
Bull HN agreed to hire an equal employment opportunity manager, and
maintain the position for at least five years; give weight to
seniority, teach decision-makers about age discrimination law and
require that all supervisors report any information concerning
possible age discrimination to the EEO manager or risk disciplinary
action.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-page settlement includes several other provisions,
including a requirement that Bull HN train employees to investigate
complaints on age discrimination, and show them how to evaluate
evidence.

 &HT;    Let's not be so quick to swallow Flynt's `new media' elixir
 &HT;    By Mary McMarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's official: Larry Flynt isn't just your
hometown smut peddler any more. He's a folk hero for the First
Amendment; no, he's an elder statesman and un-maker of kings; no,
he's a member of the ``new media,'' as Newsweek christened him this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Whew. Makes you nostalgic for the days he was hawking Bachelor
Beat on the streets of downtown Dayton, a dime an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's offering millions for Congressional smut _ and, like
everyone else in this Washington sleazeathon, robing himself in
righteousness. ``To expose the hypocrisy of Washington _ that was
my only motivation,'' Flynt told Dayton Daily News reporter Tom
Beyerlein on Wednesday. ``Nobody was standing up to be counted on
the issue. I wanted to do what I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   We can't help feeling a certain begrudging amusement at seeing
Washington's hypocrisy exposed. ``Serves 'em right,'' a part of us
says. ``What's good for the goose is good for the gander.'' Some
even argue Flynt is the cure for our political ills, a sign that
things have sunk so low they can only get better.
</P>
<P>
   Time to quit snickering and making excuses and listen to our
better instincts. If we're troubled by all the book deals, nose
jobs and modeling contracts swirling around the allegations against
the president, we should be the first to repudiate Flynt's attempts
to buy political ``revelations.'' If we don't think Clinton's sex
life should be the consuming topic of national policy, we should
fight the movement to extend that conversation to the entire
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   We shouldn't try to level the playing field; we should seek
higher moral ground. Immediately.
</P>
<P>
   It's troubling to see Larry Flynt among the cast of characters
Newsweek, in a cover story featuring radio shock jock Don Imus,
anoints as the ``new media.'' Granted, the press does need fresh,
alternative voices, especially in an age when media conglomerates
control more and more news outlets. But are these gossipmongers and
tabloid journalists what we had in mind? They're bullying and
bartering their way to the table, and they're far more interested
in sizzle than substance.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the ``new news,'' as Newsweek calls it, are celebrities
themselves, and they further blur the distinction between E! and
the evening news. If we accept them as Cronkite's Kids, as Murrow's
progeny, we can expect more of the same. Less on issues, more on
personality. Less on policy, more on the sex lives of politicians.
</P>
<P>
   We can't push Flynt away from the table, but we can push
ourselves away. We can't stop him from offering millions to women
who can prove adulterous affairs with congressmen, but we can stop
treating his garbage from tainted ``sources'' as legitimate news.
</P>
<P>
   We can see Flynt for what he is (as we in Dayton, of all places,
should know): a pathetic, two-bit pornographer who has made his
fortune from degrading women.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Flynt isn't a beacon of the First Amendment. He's part of
the price we pay for having it. Larry Flynt isn't the cure for what
ails Washington. He's one of its most revolting symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   In a free society, we can't stop Flynt from hawking his wares,
whether it's on the newsstands or on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But we don't have to buy what he sells.

   The Monday after New Year's, Karen Tipper and her daughter,
Meagan, strolled the Worcester Common Outlets mall in Worcester,
Mass., in search of a suit. Not just any suit, mind you. Like many
shoppers these days, the women had both high expectations and tight
purse strings. Their goal: a designer label for around $150.
Benetton and Ann Taylor were worth a visit, they knew; they had
found bargains there before. But they steered clear of tonier
designers like Donna Karan and Joan &AMP; David. Meagan, a first-year
law student, scoffed at their prices. ``They are saying $350 is
cheap,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a decade of explosive growth and outsized profit
margins, the outlet industry has run into trouble. Facing increased
competition from fashion-conscious discounters, sale-happy
department stores and increasingly savvy shoppers like the Tippers,
outlets, which feature direct-from-manufacturer merchandise at
supposedly bargain prices, got a rebuke from both consumers and
investors in 1998.

   At the end of October, sales in outlet center stores open at
least a year, a standard industry measurement, were down nearly 2
percent, according to Value Retail News, a unit of the
International Council of Shopping Centers. Regional malls, by
contrast, were up 3 percent. A fairly robust Christmas season
probably gave the outlets a lift, but even so, Prime Retail Inc.,
the biggest player in the field with 25 percent of all outlet space
nationwide, predicted that holiday sales would bring its overall
figures for stores open at least a year at its malls only to last
year's level _ significantly lower than the 5.9 percent growth the
entire retail industry experienced in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Some 50 percent of outlet space is owned and operated by real
estate investment trusts, or REITs _ publicly traded real estate
holding companies _ and stock prices for these trusts were also
down significantly for the year. Prime Retail ended the year with
its value down 21 percent. Tanger Factory Outlets Centers, the
nation's No. 2 outlet real estate trust, recorded an even more
precipitous 25 percent drop. Chelsea GCA Realty Inc., which rounds
out the top three REITs, did considerably better but still returned
under 1 percent to investors. Overall, according to the Morgan
Stanley index, REITs were down 17 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointing sales numbers and stock prices do not give a full
picture of the industry's health, of course. Operating costs for
outlet stores are still relatively low, and sales per square foot
are still relatively high. Unlike department stores, which run on
much tighter margins, profits for outlet retailers can be good even
in an off year. David Bloom, chairman and chief executive of
Chelsea GCA, points to Waikele Premium Outlets in Hawaii, a
top-performing property in its portfolio that has been hit hard by
the fall-off in Japanese tourists. ``That center was doing over
$500 a square foot before'' the Asian crisis, he said. ``Now it is
off 20 percent, but it is still an extremely strong center.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are plenty of signs that outlets have hit harder
times. From 1988, when outlet mania began, to 1997, the number of
outlet centers roughly tripled, from 108 to 329, according to Value
Retail News. By the end of 1998, there were only 301 such malls.
The number of chains with outlet stores also declined from a high
of 543 in 1996 to 493 at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, many big-name designers, whose stores
usually anchor the outlet malls and are the primary draw for
shoppers, had a bumpy year. In October, when second-quarter results
were announced, Polo Ralph Lauren told analysts its sales at stores
open at least a year were down 4 percent for the year. Lauren would
not break outlet numbers out from its retail operation as a whole,
but a company spokesman, Hamilton South, acknowledged that the
performance of the Lauren outlet stores was ``mixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones Apparel Group said both third- and fourth-quarter outlet
sales at stores open a year or more dropped by single-digit
percents. The company plans to cull its 245 outlet stores to around
200 by the end of this year. Before the release of its
fourth-quarter sales numbers, earlier this week Lands' End
announced that it would close three of its 19 outlet stores. Donna
Karan International blamed, in part, the softness in its outlet
store business for unhappy third-quarter results.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Black, executive vice president of Black &AMP; Co. and an
apparel and footwear analyst, said that ``every single blow-up''
among the companies she follows this year ``had to do with
outlets.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry is suffering, in part, from reckless expansion.
Linda Humphers, editor of Value Retail News, said outlets were
``the darling'' for a while. ``Then, as developers will do, they
built quickly and willy-nilly,'' she added. Now investors are more
cautious, she said, but the bad centers are still out there. David
Fick, a senior analyst at Legg Mason who specializes in retail real
estate investment, is more blunt. ``Half the centers should never
have been built, period,'' he said. ``As they start to fall off the
cliff, their numbers are dragging the industry down with them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why top mall operators say the current contraction is not
grave news but a necessary corrective that will leave many outlets
stronger. Bloom, of Chelsea, foresees a weeding out of the weak
centers and manufacturers that are giving outlet stores a bad name.
``You are going to see a shift away from centers that were poorly
planned and tenanted,'' he said. ``If the shakeout happened sooner,
we would welcome it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are some superstar performers among the outlet
centers, including, for example, the Woodbury Commons Premium
Outlet Center in Central Valley, N.Y., an hour outside New York
City, and Potomac Mills Mall in Prince William, Va., a huge
entertainment-shopping hybrid 45 minutes south of Washington. Such
``megacenters'' have added significant new space the last year, and
many experts say the ones close to population centers still have a
great future.

</P>
<P>
   Similarly, developers say it does not matter that the number of
chains available in outlet malls is decreasing, as long as the
number of quality chains is rising. William Carpenter, president
and chief executive of Prime Retail, points to the juggernaut
retailer Gap as an example of a chain with strong sales that is
bucking the trend by aggressively rolling out new outlet stores.
</P>
<P>
   But some industry insiders argue that overexpansion also takes a
toll in consumer trust that will not be so easily remedied. Outlets
started as a much-needed way for manufacturers to rid themselves of
excess inventory. As they turned into cash cows, however,
manufacturers that did not have enough seconds began manufacturing
some merchandise especially for the outlet stores, much of it of
lower quality.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Buerkle, who manages outlets for Jones Apparel Group,
said that practice, which Jones eschews, bred ``a certain amount of
distrust'' among previously loyal customers. ``People want a frame
of reference when they shop,'' he said. ``They want to be able to
compare a price from a department store and know they are getting
it for less. Otherwise they feel they are being taken advantage
of.''
</P>
<P>
   And as developers readily acknowledge, the total retail
environment is much fiercer than when outlets started to take off _
and that is not likely to change anytime soon. ``We are getting
more competition from places like Target,'' Carpenter of Prime
Retail said. ``They've got pretty decent merchandise.''
</P>
<P>
   Janie Ligon, vice president for global direct-to-consumer sales
at Levi Strauss &AMP; Co., which sold its 25 outlet stores to Design
Inc. in August, adds that as customers get more choices, they are
less willing to make the trade-offs in quality and seasonality that
the outlet industry was originally based on. ``The consumer is
having expectations we can't meet yet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as threatening to the long-term health of outlets is that
department stores, which carry a selection of designer goods, are
getting more competitive on markdowns each year. The outlet centers
have been hurt recently by high-profile reports in the news media
that found that their prices were often no better than sale prices
in department stores or boutiques and in some cases even full
retail. Whether this is true or not, the perceived savings may not
be deep enough to tempt any but the most committed fashion plates
to travel an extra 20 minutes to an hour to shop at an outlet
rather than at a local department store.
</P>
<P>
   Shawne Mastronardi, director of consumer marketing services at
Kurt Salmon Associates, a retail consulting firm, said Salmon's
annual survey of shoppers suggested a darker future for outlets. At
the end of 1998, 23 percent more people said they were less likely
to shop in outlet centers in the coming year than said they were
more likely to do so. ``The channel isn't dead,'' she said, ``but
the consumer is more sophisticated, and it will take more to keep
her happy.''

   NEW YORK _ In a move to expand and solidify its presence in the
electronic marketplace, Time Warner Inc. on Thursday announced the
formation of Time Warner E-Commerce. The unit will consolidate the
company's direct-marketing efforts already on the World Wide Web
and introduce other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Pepe, the former president of the Time Inc. Business
Information Group _ which includes Fortune, Money, Your Company and
Mutual Funds magazine _ was named president of the new unit,
overseeing several hundred employees working for the company's 35
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   No sites are to be shut down. Instead, Pepe said, the intention
is to ``use the infrastructure of Time Inc., a direct-marketing
powerhouse from order processing to fulfillment, so that with our
existing businesses and our established brands, we can build a
business of scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Pathfinder, Time-Warner's five-year-old Internet system, already
offers sites for Time Inc. magazines, but has not drawn the
advertising that had been expected.
</P>
<P>
   Pepe said that the magazine group's growth in e-commerce could
be big. ``We're beginning to create parallel, complementary Web
sites for our magazines that will provide new ways to talk to our
consumers.''

W.R. GRACE PAID FINE _ 10 YEARS LATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, e and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Amid an aggressive public relations offensive to
counter its portrayal in the film ``A Civil Action,'' W.R. Grace &AMP;
Co. had to pause this week to explain an embarrassing glitch: the
multinational firm did not pay its fine in the related criminal
case for 10 years _ just as cameras for the Hollywood production
were rolling in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A Grace spokeswoman confirmed to the Globe that the $10,000 fine
was paid in 1998, a decade after the corporation pleaded guilty to
one count of a two-count criminal indictment charging that it lied
to the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The company, whose role in the famous Woburn pollution case is
getting national attention because of the release of the box office
hit, could not explain the delay in paying the fine, which was
levied by the US District Court in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But the revelation of Grace's late payment has rubbed salt in
the wounds of those in the Woburn community who are convinced that
the firm's pollution led to the cancer-related deaths of seven
children and one adult.
</P>
<P>
   Local leaders and families of the victims note that Grace has
refused to acknowledge its role in the pollution of the city's
drinking water. They said the delay of payment of the fine confirms
to them the company's attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another example of their arrogance and their refusal to
aceept responsibility,'' said Carol Donovan, the Democratic state
representative who represents Woburn. ``They just don't want to
accept any responsibility for anything they have done.'' Anne
Anderson, whose son Jimmy died of leukemia in 1981, said she is not
surprised at Grace's having let a decade pass before paying the
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would it surprise me?'' said Anderson, who spearheaded the
case that led to the lawsuits against Grace and Beatrice Foods.
``They have never wanted to admit guilt or any degree of
culpability. What they consider right and wrong in their eyes, I
will never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston attorney R. Robert Popeo, who defended Grace in the
criminal case, said the corporation had ``acted responsibly with
respect to this matter.'' He said the delay in payment was an
oversight by prosecutors, the court, and the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the oversight was called to the company's attention the
fine was paid promptly thereafter,'' said Popeo, who is
representing General Electric in a pollution case in Pittsfield.
Federal and state environmental agencies say GE is guilty of having
polluted its property and the Housatonic River with chemical PCBs.
</P>
<P>
   Jane McGuinness, director of communications for W.R. Grace, said
the company was ``equally surprised'' the fine had not been paid
earlier. She noted the fine is dwarfed by the ``millions of
dollars'' the firm is paying for cleaning up its property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly would have not been purposefully remiss on the
$10,000 fine,'' McGuinness said.
</P>
<P>
   As ``A Civil Action,'' starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall,
climbs to the top of the box office charts, Grace has mounted a
strong public relations offensive to counter the allegations raised
in the case. The charges had lain dormant until the best-selling
book by the same name appeared several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it used the experience to revamp its
environmental policies. ``Grace has spent 12 years applying lessons
learned from these earlier mistakes and restoring the community's
confidence and trust,'' the company reports on its Internet site,
which was designed to deal with the publicity generated by the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   The families' lawsuit identified Grace and Beatrice Foods as
owners of property near the wells where there were huge toxic waste
dumps. After an 80-day trial in 1986, a jury concluded Beatrice was
not responsible for the pollution and the case against the firm was
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury did find that Grace was potentially culpable. The
corporation, however, settled with the families before the start of
the new trial that Judge Walter J. Skinner had ordered, paying them
$8 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a related case that received far less attention, Grace
pleaded guilty to one count of a two-count criminal indictment
brought by the US attorney's office that accused the company of
lying to the EPA about the amount of potentially toxic chemicals it
had purchased.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's plea in May 1988 _ meant that it conceded prosecutors
had enough evidence for conviction if the case had gone to trial,
but still maintained it was innocent of the charge.
</P>
<P>
   In the plea, the firm was admitting to its undereporting of the
amount the chemical acetone that was purchased by its Woburn plant.
</P>
<P>
   It was another chemical cited in a separate section of the
indictment, trichloroethylene, that seeped into Woburn's drinking
water. But while prosecutors had charged that Grace lied to the EPA
when it told the agency in 1982 it had only purchased one drum of
the chemical, the company did not concede that point when the case
was settled.

 &HT;    CLINTON IGNORES OPENING OF IMPEACHMENT TRIAL
 &HT;    Eds: Removes last 2 grafs of original; economic meeting
postponed.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton spent an icy Thursday out of
earshot of his prosecutors at the Senate impeachment trial and, for
the most part, out of sight of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he huddled with senior aides on foreign and domestic
policy issues, called for $6 billion in new police spending over
the next five years, and worked, at times by himself, in the Oval
Office on his upcoming State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   As darkness fell on the capital and his prosecution continued, a
freezing rain forced Clinton to postpone a scheduled flight to New
York. Aides said he still hoped to make the trip Friday morning to
discuss with Wall Street executives ideas for making capitalism
more beneficial to the nation's poor.
</P>
<P>
   On the dreariest of winter days, and surely one of the gloomiest
of his political career, Clinton did his best to ignore opening
arguments in the trial targeting his office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's official day began with a 9 a.m. planning meeting with
chief of staff John Podesta, then progressed to his daily security
briefing with national security adviser Samuel Berger, who
doubtless discussed the strikes made earlier in the morning on
Iraqi defense positions by U.S. war planes, the fourth such strikes
in as many days.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then met with his top domestic policy adviser, Bruce
Reed, who has been working to hammer out remaining details in the
agenda the president plans to unveil when he delivers his annual
State of the Union address to Congress next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Clinton motorcaded across the Potomac to nearby
Alexandria, Va., where he unveiled his latest crime prevention
proposal to a group of police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that in the budget he plans to propose to Congress
on Feb. 1 he would ask for an additional $6 billion in funding over
the next five years to support the hiring of police.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will help to hire and redeploy an additional thirty to
fifty thousand community police officers over that same period,''
Clinton said. ''It'll be the best investment we can make in a safe
future for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not say where the money would come from to pay for
the increase, but he stressed that the budget he proposes would be
balanced, implying that he would submit either spending cuts or tax
hikes to offset the additional expense.
</P>
<P>
   He hailed the progress the country has made against crime _ and
attributed some of the gains to the 92,000 additional police that
have been hired under previous Clinton initiatives _ but said more
must be done to both head off the conditions that breed criminals
and to confront violent crime on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, the crime rate's the lowest it's been in 30 years,''
Clinton said, but ''I don't know anyone who seriously believes that
we have a country as safe as it ought to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returned to the White House, where he had his weekly
lunch with Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   By the time House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., opened the prosecution against him in the Senate at 1 p.m.,
Clinton was in the Oval Office _ where there is no television _ at
work on the State of the Union message.
</P>
<P>
   He remained there most of the afternoon _ at times with senior
aides, other times by himself _ reviewing, rehearsing and rewriting
drafts of different sections of the speech.

JERZY GROTOWSKI, 65, DIRECTOR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerzy Grotowski, the Polish director who was one of the most
important and influential theatrical innovators of his time, died
Thursday in Pontedera, Italy. He was 65 and lived in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Grotowski died after years of fighting leukemia, said director
Andre Gregory, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   As founder and head of the Polish Laboratory Theater, as a
teacher and as the author of a seminal 1970 book, ``Towards a Poor
Theater,'' Grotowski had a profound effect on the art of acting and
on the experimental theater movement. The actor, he said, must be
``the direct creator in the same sense as a poet or painter.'' The
focus in his work was on ``the immediate act that must exist during
the performance which is, for me, the axis of my attitude toward
the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory called him one of ``the great visionaries in modern
theater,'' and ranked him as a director alongside Konstantin
Stanislavsky, Vsevolod Meyerhold, Eugene Vakhtangov and Bertolt
Brecht. Summarizing Grotowski's approach to acting, Gregory said,
``He saw the entire actor as an emotional, physical and vocal
instrument.'' As Peter Brook has said, ``No one since Stanislavsky
has investigated the nature of acting, its phenomenon, its meaning
... as deeply and completely as Grotowski.''
</P>
<P>
   In his teaching and his direction, Grotowski looked to the
mythic roots of the art. In ``Towards a Poor Theater,'' he posed
the question, what can the theater do without? He answered that it
could do without lights, music, scenery, it could even do without a
theater. What it needed was one actor and one member of the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, he said, was to ``enlarge on images deeply rooted in
the collective unconscious.'' His theater was spiritual,
ritualistic and nonliterary _ and extraordinarily challenging for
the actor and for the audience. The actors, fiercely trained under
his leadership, were called upon to use their bodies and voices in
strange and demanding ways, and to create dehumanizing sounds in
performance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Grotowski made his first visit to New York in 1969, with a
repertory of plays including ``Acropolis'' and ``The Constant
Prince,'' theatergoers, limited to 100 for each performance, were
led into a small theater space at the Washington Square Methodist
Church. There they became witnesses to often horrific events
dealing with torture and death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acropolis'' was written in 1904 by the Polish playwright
Stanislaw Wyspianski, but, as reinterpreted by Grotowski, it
conjured the atmosphere of Auschwitz. ``The Constant Prince,''
based on a 17th-century Spanish play, was a Passion play featuring
Richard Cieslak, the quintessential Grotowski actor. Grotowski's
theater was political as well as metaphysical.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Lichtenstein, head of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, one
of the producers who first brought over Grotowski, recalled that
each piece was incredibly concentrated, one tension-filled hour,
performed ``at a fever pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   As a director and conceptualist, Grotowski influenced Brook,
Gregory, Joseph Chaikin, Andrei Serban, the Mabou Mines and many
other experimental directors in Europe and Asia as well as the
United States. Because of his revolutionary approach, his work was
often subject to misconception. Some considered it to be anarchic
and anti-art. Instead he believed in form and discipline: The aim
was creativity, not chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Grotowski was well aware of the challenges of his radical
beliefs and of the fact that many came to regard him as a guru. He
once said that Stanislavsky ``was killed by his disciples and I
think I am going the same route.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the mystique of Grotowski was in his own appearance and
manner. Generally dressed in a dark business suit, shrouding his
eyes behind dark glasses, he projected an aura of detachment until
he began to speak, which he did with great fervor. The year after
his American debut, he returned to New York for a series of
lectures to clear up ``Misconceptions in the United States about
the Grotowski Method.''
</P>
<P>
   One session began at midnight at Manhattan's Town Hall and
lasted until 4 a.m. The change in his appearance from the previous
year was startling. He had lost 88 pounds, had grown a wispy beard,
wore an open-necked shirt and had removed his dark glasses. In a
nonstop, 90-minute monologue, he disowned his imitators, criticized
his critics for their narrow interpretations of his art,
discredited some of his own work and studiously declined
deification.
</P>
<P>
   He was angry that some people categorized his theater as
completely spiritual and psychic or purely physical. To him, it was
all of those things, and each was inextricable from the other. He
said that creation was a kind of confession, a method by which one
discovered and ``unveiled'' oneself. Trying to explain his concept
of a ``poor theater,'' he dismissed ``directorial tricks,
preconceived notions, intellectual concepts, gymnastics, chaos,
cries, violence.'' For him, these were masks or armor behind which
people hid. After several hours of questions from the audience of
theater professionals and academics, he said, ``I am not a
prophet.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Rzeszow, Poland. At the beginning of World War
II, his father left Poland for Paraguay. He and his brother,
Kazimierz (later a professor of nuclear physics), were brought up
by their mother.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the State Theater School in Cracow, he
went to Moscow where he studied the work of Stanislavsky, Meyerhold
and others.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in 1969, he spoke with admiration about those
Russian directors, but acknowledged only one master: Julius
Osterwa, a Polish actor and director, who ``treated acting as a
human experience that exists not FOR the public, but vis-a-vis the
public.'' That idea inspired him to deal with theater of an ethical
or metaphysical order.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, Grotowski began directing in Poland. Two years later in
the provincial town of Opole he formed his own company with a group
of actors. It became the Laboratory Theater, and was relocated in
Wraclow. His visit to New York in 1969 placed him and his work
under intense theatrical scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he stopped directing performances of plays and began
specializing in paratheatrical productions or public events. In the
1980s, he found a home in America, teaching at Columbia University
and, for several years, at the University of California at Irvine.
Eventually, he was awarded a ``genius'' grant from the MacArthur
Foundation. In recent years he had been working at his theatrical
center in Pontedera.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was working in theater, he created pieces with a
sacred theme,'' said Gregory. ``In his last work, he was trying to
create a sacred theater, exploring the nature of prayer.'' To the
end, Grotowski continued to be a restless explorer, provoked by his
curiosity and his passion for his art.
</P>
<P>
   Once, in a public forum, he was asked why he kept talking about
going into the unknown. He answered, ``I hate going into the
unknown. That's where I'm forced to go.''

SURVEY REVEALS MORE MIDDLE-CLASS, FEMALE 'NET USERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet is no longer the exclusive domain of young male
technophiles and the affluent, well-educated elite.
</P>
<P>
   A survey released Thursday indicates that the 74 million
Americans who sit down at their computers almost daily to use the
Internet are increasingly less well-educated, lower income and
female.
</P>
<P>
   The survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press in Washington found that just over half of the 32 million new
users in the United States since 1996 were women. Forty percent
said they never attended college, and 23 percent said their
houshold incomes are under $30,000 a year. Twenty percent were over
age 50.
</P>
<P>
   Cooks go to the World Wide Web to find new recipes,
middle-school students prowl its pages to learn about France or
Mexico or Japan, and senior citizens use it to keep up with friends
who have moved.
</P>
<P>
   Educators, police officers, innkeepers _ we're all there.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Rushton for example, a Massachusetts teacher's aide who is
``on every night'' scouting for materials she can use with
first-graders, or exchanging e-mail with her daughter in college in
Rhode Island or with aunts and uncles in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Or Richard Sevieri, a police investigator who reads online
editions of Boston-area community and college newspapers, looking
for reports of crimes similar to those he is working on.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's information you'd never get without this,'' he said.
The survey did find Internet users still are younger, better
educated, and more affluent than the nation as a whole _ as is
widely perceived.
</P>
<P>
   In just two years, the number of regular Internet users has
grown by 78 percent to about two-fifths of the US population,
according to Pew, which surveyed 3,184 adults nationwide by
telephone during November.
</P>
<P>
   But the study's most striking finding was the sizable growth in
new types of users, especially those who never attended college.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very different demographic pattern, and it's a very
different use pattern'' than in the past, said Andrew Kohut, who
conducted the poll for the Pew Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Sending and receiving electronic mail came up as the most
popular activity, followed by checking up on weather conditions at
home and away. In 1996 the top attraction was news related to
technology.
</P>
<P>
   More typical, perhaps, were users such as Malva Crothers of
Wellesley, a former sales representative who now operates a home
child care business and dreams of someday owning a country inn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in touch with other innkeepers'' who post World Wide
Web pages, she said. That is, when she hasn't been surfing sites
associated with Ireland, travel, writing, cooking, or women's
issues _ or communicating by e-mail with her college roommate from
many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's addictive,'' Crothers said. ``I wish the computer were
downstairs in the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the shift could be the radical drop in computer
prices, with high-speed desktop computer systems now widely
available for less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   A spurt during the last half of 1998 in television ads by
retailers promoting Internet shopping could be another reason, said
Frank Gens, senior vice president for Internet research at
International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically the Internet is converging with the real world,''
Gens said. He predicted the audience change will bring changes in
how Web pages present information. ``I think we'll see a dumbing
down,'' he said, ``more like the TV model.''
</P>
<P>
   Gens questioned, however, whether a telephone survey could
produce accurate results about Web-page usage.
</P>
<P>
   He said Internet tracking services that count actual Web page
``hits'' by a known sample of users repeatedly find adult
entertainment is the most popular category, dominated by men.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to have a lot of people volunteer that
information on the telephone,'' Gens said.
</P>
<P>
   Among women, those same services report sites about books and
travel attract disproportionately high numbers of women.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew survey found use of the Internet to obtain news growing
rapidly, with as much as one-quarter of all US users going online
at least once a week for this purpose, compared with 4 percent
reported in a 1995 survey.
</P>
<P>
   Online readers of news said they liked the convenience, the
availability of news not accessible elsewhere, and the ability to
search for particular subjects.

DESPITE SLOWDOWN, EURO ECONOMIES DIVIDED OVER INTEREST RATE CUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Two weeks after 11 countries successfully
began using a single currency, the euro, a raft of recent evidence
indicates that their economies are stalling faster than experts had
expected a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, which accounts for a quarter of the euro zone's
economic output, industrial production has declined and the
double-digit rate of joblessness has begun to climb again. The
government reported Thursday that the economy expanded by 2.8
percent in 1998, its best result in four years, and higher than the
2.2 percent in 1997. But most economists think that growth nearly
stopped in the last few months and will be well below 2 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In France, the government said Thursday that growth in the third
quarter of 1998 slowed to half a percent, the least in a year and a
half. In Italy, which has been lagging behind its neighbors for the
last year, economists are saying industrial production began to
decline in November.
</P>
<P>
   All this comes after the first year of strong economic growth by
all 11 euro nations since 1994. It is also occurring as Europe's
average unemployment rate remains above 10 percent and political
leaders had been counting on economic revival for some relief.
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown is putting pressure on the new European Central
Bank, which oversees the single currency, to relax monetary policy
and reduce interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   But European countries remain sharply divided. Ireland expanded
at the spectacular rate of 7 percent last year and is still growing
rapidly. Spain, Portugal and Finland are growing at nearly 4
percent, and creating jobs as well.
</P>
<P>
   Many if not most economists are convinced that the European
Central Bank will soon have to lower rates, probably to 2.8 percent
from the current base-line rate of 3 percent. The individual
central banks of the 11 euro countries cut their rates to 3 percent
in December, just before the currency's introduction.
</P>
<P>
   At least in public, though, central bankers continue to
discourage speculation about the easing of monetary policy.
``Unemployment in the euro area is largely structural in origin,''
the president of the central bank, Wim Duisenberg, said in a speech
Thursday in Amsterdam. ``Implementing an inflationary monetary
policy will not solve this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   His hawkish view was reinforced by Hans Tietmeyer, president of
Germany's central bank. Arguing that the December rate cut was
appropriate, Tietmeyer told a meeting of bankers here Thursday that
the last decision had ``clarified the horizon for rates for the
foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, signs of economic trouble are accumulating. The
turmoil in Brazil, and continuing problems in Russia and much of
Asia, have hit European companies in several ways. Most economists
predict that growth across the 11 euro nations will slip to about 2
percent this year, with many saying it could be lower than that.
</P>
<P>
   Ignazio Visco, chief economist at the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, noted that the OECD, a Paris-based
group of 29 industrial nations, had projected European growth
around 2.5 percent last November. But that estimate was based in
part on the assumption that Brazil would not unravel and that
Japanese growth would not decline.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of those is currently true.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were no additional complications, Europe could still
grow at rates that might be called satisfactory,'' Visco said.
``But the situation is really different now from a global point of
view.''
</P>
<P>
   European exports, particularly those from Germany, have been a
pillar of economic growth for the last year. But they have
significantly slowed, in part because of plunging demand from Asia,
and in part because European currencies climbed in value last year
and made the exports more expensive abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Depressing signs have come from Germany, Europe's largest
economy. In a report that caught most experts by surprise, the
German government reported on Tuesday that industrial production
dropped 2.3 percent in November. That was much steeper than
expected, and it suggested that the slowdown in other parts of the
world may have stalled investment in German factories and
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufacturers are essentially in a recession,'' said Joachim
Fels, who tracks European economics for Morgan Stanley in London.
And while countries like Spain and Ireland continue to grow much
faster than most others, all European countries are seeing their
growth slowing. ``They are all being hit by the same external
shocks,'' Fels said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial turmoil in Brazil _ following the decision there
Wednesday to let the Brazilian currency fall below its former
trading range and the accompanying plunge in stock prices _ only
worsens Europe's problems.
</P>
<P>
   German and Spanish banks have been the heaviest lenders to
Brazil, after the United States, according to data released in
November by the Bank for International Settlements in Basel. German
banks were the biggest suppliers of fresh capital to Brazil last
year, but Spanish banks are more heavily exposed because they own
many banks or stakes in banks through Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   A peculiar trend throughout Europe right now is that consumers
are surprisingly optimistic while businesses are generally gloomy.
In a survey of European purchasing managers by Reuters this week,
most business executives said they had cut back for the third
consecutive month as a result of gloomy expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, German construction companies predicted Thursday that
they would have no growth at all this year and would eliminate
about 50,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Netherlands, one of Europe's star economic performers the
last few years, the government reported Thursday that manufacturing
activity declined 1.8 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
   But consumers seem more buoyant. European consumer confidence
was higher in December than at any time since 1990, according to a
survey released this week by the European Union's statistical
agency. In Germany, retail sales jumped 3.5 percent in December
compared with those in December 1997. And car companies like BMW
and Volkswagen have had monthslong waiting lists for new models.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in car buying ``highlights the perplexing signals that
the economy is currently generating,'' said Nick Snee, an analyst
with J.P. Morgan in London. ``Business confidence is generally weak
in Western Europe. However, consumer confidence indicators are more
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Fels of Morgan Stanley said consumers might simply have more
money in their pockets. Inflation has been so low that many
products, especially imports, have declined in price.
</P>
<P>
   But most economists are skeptical that consumers will rescue
Europe from a significant slowdown and are looking toward the
European Central Bank for help
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with cutting interest rates and making more
money available is that growing economies like those of Spain or
Ireland could begin to overheat, causing inflation. But the
fast-growth economies are so small in comparison with France's and
Germany's that most economists think the central bank has room for
maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European Central Bank should not be looking at individual
countries but at the area as a whole,'' Visco of the OECD said.
``If you look across a region, inflation on average is still very
low.''

`60 MINUTES II' GETS BIG RATINGS
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The introduction of the second CBS news magazine ``60 Minutes''
was a success Wednesday night, scoring the highest rating of any
program that night and more than doubling the audience that the
network had been attracting in that time period.
</P>
<P>
   ``60 Minutes II'' had a 12.4 rating, according to preliminary
national ratings announced by CBS on Thursday _ 110 percent more
than CBS has averaged on Wednesday nights at 9 this season. The
program beat established hits like ABC's ``Drew Carey Show,'' which
had an 11.2 rating and NBC's ``Law and Order,'' which had an 11.6
rating. Each rating point represents 994,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   CBS executives said that the numbers proved the value of the
network's promotion of the program in recent weeks. The show was
the third new entry by one of the four large broadcast networks to
be introduced in the last week and garner high ratings, following
``Providence'' Friday on NBC and ``The PJ's'' Sunday on Fox.

NEW NBC BOSS TALKS OF REDUCING SEX CONTENT IN PROGRAMMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The new president of NBC Entertainment woke
up a few dozing TV critics Thursday by talking about sex. In
describing NBC's vision of the future, Scott Sassa, speaking at his
first critics' press tour in Pasadena, said the network needs to
scale back on sexual situations in its programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``When sex is used in a smart way,'' Sassa said, ``it works out
OK. But sometimes we could use a few more words between `Hello' and
`Will you sleep with me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sassa, who spent nine years with Turner Broadcasting System,
said he's not trying to fashion another Family Channel, but that
it's time for the pendulum to swing back a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we use sex, we need to be smarter about how it's used,
and lessen the amount of sex that's gratuitous,'' he said. ``People
like to see people like themselves on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Sassa added that he has no intention of being the prudish
executive who passes admonishing notes to producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really about the fact that in some cases we use sex to
get an easy laugh,'' he said, ``and we just need to be careful with
that. ... I'm not saying `no sex.' I am saying `less sex,' and it
depends on the type of show. `Friends' is a show that's about
single people that live in New York. They will come into situations
where they meet people and they have sex with them. We just need to
be careful about how many of those shows we have. ... It's about
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC has already launched its midseason series _ ``Lateline'' and
``Providence'' _ so most of its presentations Thursday dealt with
movies and miniseries, three of them rooted in real events.
</P>
<P>
   One is ``The '60s,'' a four-hour miniseries (Feb. 7 and 8) about
the tumultuous decade as seen through the eyes of two fictional
American families _ the Herlihys in Chicago and the Taylors in
Greenwood, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Another is ``Mutiny,'' the little-known story about the
aftermath of a deadly explosion at a munitions base near San
Francisco during World War II. Fearing another explosion, 50
sailors, all of them black, refused to go back to work and were
tried for mutiny, discharged and sentenced to 15 years of hard
labor. An airdate has not been assigned.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the miniseries ``Hunt for the Unicorn,'' a
story still unfolding about a 1970s social activist named Ira
Einhorn who is accused of killing his girlfriend, Holly Maddux.
Einhorn fled the United States in 1981 just days before he was to
be tried. He was convicted in absentia but eluded discovery for 16
years. Found to be living in France in 1997, Einhorn has
successfully fended off extradition. A new decision on his fate was
postponed this week until Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers who loved Kevin Anderson as the compassionate Father Ray
on ``Nothing Sacred'' last season may be surprised to see him
playing Einhorn, who's portrayed as a sort of intellectual con man.
But Anderson said it's just a matter of tapping into the right
personality trait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a little of both men in all of us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peri Gilpin joins many viewers in celebrating Frasier Crane's
return to work as a psychiatrist-of-the-airwaves on ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilpin plays Roz Doyle, Frasier's producer, and she doesn't
quibble with the decision to create a story arc that had Frasier
unemployed at the end of last season and much of this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that the writers had the guts to try it,'' she said,
``but the only thing missing for me was that I had nothing to do.''

PATRIOTS OFFER RUCCI TO EXPANSION TEAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH AND NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ During the second half of the season, it was intriguing
to watch how the Patriots handled the left guard position.
</P>
<P>
   First, veteran Max Lane, who had started for the last two years,
was benched in favor of third-year man Heath Irvin. Then Irvin was
replaced by second-year man Damon Denson. Finally, in their most
important game of the season, the playoff contest in Jacksonville,
Lane was reinserted as the starter.
</P>
<P>
   And in the offseason, the Patriots are continuing their
inconsistent approach.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, when the names of the Patriots left unprotected in the
expansion draft to stock the Cleveland Browns are revealed, Lane,
Irvin, and Denson won't be on the list. But Todd Rucci, who started
all year at right guard, will be.
</P>
<P>
   The other four on the list also are at least somewhat
surprising. Defensive end Ferric Collons, who has been a starter
for four years and is considered the team's best run-stopper, is
being made available.
</P>
<P>
   Oft-injured wide receiver Vincent Brisby, whom the Patriots
tried to trade before the draft last year but couldn't, is, too.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Rehberg, an offensive lineman who has played very little,
is being left unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   And Sedrick Shaw _ who many thought would have a lifetime job
with the Patriots because he was the first player they picked with
the draft choices they got from the Jets as compensation for the
loss of coach Bill Parcells _ rounds out the unwanted quintet.
</P>
<P>
   At least three of the moves could be for salary cap reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Rucci signed a five-year, $10 million contract last spring,
including a $2.8 million signing bonus. His salary cap figure is
about $1.8 million. The Patriots debated whether to expose Lane or
Rucci but figured Lane was more valuable because of his ability to
play both guard and tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Todd (Thursday night) that he shouldn't be surprised if
he's on the list,'' said Rucci's agent, Jack Bechta. ``Someone has
to be on it, and it might be a situation where if Todd is taken, it
might alleviate some salary cap room.''
</P>
<P>
   If Rucci is taken, it appears Lane would move to his left guard
spot and Denson would shift to right guard, his natural position.
The Patriots also are looking into free agency for a guard.
</P>
<P>
   Collons's salary is scheduled to leap from $575,000 to $2
million, and he is due a $700,000 advance March 1. He might be
scooped up in the draft because defensive linemen are at a premium
and Collons has performed well against the 49ers, whom Browns
executives Carmen Policy and Dwight Clark used to run.
</P>
<P>
   Collons has been a steady, productive performer the last four
years. Like many of his teammates, he was not always in the best of
shape, but when he was on the field, he got the job done _ though
obviously not to the liking of vice president of player personnel
Bobby Grier and coach Pete Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Brisby is scheduled to earn $1.8 million this year. His salary
cap figure is $2 million, a lot for a part-time receiver.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't likely he will be taken because receivers are easier to
come by than linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Vincent would be pleased either way,'' said his agent,
Michael George. ``Briz just wants to play, whether it's in New
England or in Cleveland or elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he isn't drafted, the Patriots may cut Brisby so they
can use the money for another receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who played at Iowa, Grier's alma mater, was touted by some
as the Patriots' best pick two years ago. But like Chris Canty, the
first pick that year, third-round selection Shaw has been a major
disappointment. The Patriots thought about putting Canty on the
list but have discovered they might be able to get something for
the cornerback in a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Rehberg was picked in the seventh round of that draft, which
also included Denson and offensive lineman Ed Ellis, who have shown
nothing to date.
</P>
<P>
   All but four teams have submitted their lists to NFL
headquarters in New York, and those names will be announced Friday.
The four surviving playoff teams will not have to submit their
lists until after their final game.
</P>

MINNESOTA'S BILLICK MAKES THE MOST OF A SPECIAL SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Minn., Ohio, Md.)  (bl) 
By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. _ Brian Billick is a career football coach.
Plainly and simply. He does not consider himself an offensive
genius, although others within the National Football League do.
Billick just calls himself a football coach, just the offensive
coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings and just a man who is
obsessed with locating and exploiting mismatches on the field. Just
a coach.
</P>
<P>
   This is a giddy time for Billick, who is being praised for
helping to shape the talented Vikings into a record-setting
offensive unit and whose name is bouncing off the walls of the
offices of general managers whose teams are in search of a new head
coach. So every time the Vikings have another wonderful game,
complete with intricate and clever strategy on offense, Billick
inches closer to leaving Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Billick might already be gone. Even if the Vikings
fail to win the National Football Conference championship or the
Super Bowl, it would not diminish what Billick has already
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Billick probably has more artillery than anyone in the
league. But Billick, so smart and so savvy, has deployed the talent
like a savant. That is why the Cleveland Browns have already
interviewed him (permissible because they are an expansion team)
and the Baltimore Ravens have asked permission to speak with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Brian will get a head coaching job this year,'' said
Dennis Green, the head coach of the Vikings. ``He's been doing very
well, but he's not an overnight success. Remember, he's been here
almost six years.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this year has been something special. The Vikings drafted
Randy Moss, and Randall Cunningham wound up starting at quarterback
and excelling after Brad Johnson fractured his right leg and,
suddenly, a strong offensive team became a tremendous offensive
team, setting a league scoring record with 556 points. Is there
anyone else in football who would use 15 different formations to
open a game, as Billick did against the Arizona Cardinals last
week? As Billick's offense prepares for the Atlanta Falcons on
Sunday, a team he says possesses the best defense of any the
Vikings have faced, he sometimes wonders about his uncertain
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``For right now, it's a moot point to talk about because there
can be no discussions between me and other clubs,'' Billick said.
``Certainly that is in the back of my mind. I have aspired to do
that my entire professional career. Right now is not the time to
focus on that, and that's hard to do. I'm not trying to say I'm not
thinking about it in my private moments because I do, but this is
about what the Vikings are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Billick was reminded that his chances of becoming a
head coach could be enhanced if the Vikings win the Super Bowl, he
said, ``You'd like to think so, as long as there is something left
when we're all done.''
</P>
<P>
   Any team that has targeted Billick would be foolish not to wait
the extra week or two. Billick, a personable 44-year-old, who
conceded that the only things in life that matter to him are his
family and football, has wanted to be a head coach since he was a
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I do,'' Billick said.
</P>
<P>
   Billick, who baffled Arizona by opening with so many different
formations, even lined up running back David Palmer at quarterback
while slotting Cunningham as a receiver. Even though Billick also
did this to potentially unnerve Minnesota's next opponent, he
thinks the Falcons are too fundamentally sound to get flustered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to trick them,'' he said. ``You're not going
to get them out of formation.''
</P>
<P>
   All Billick is doing, he explained, is trying to unearth
favorable matchups. He is looking for ways to isolate Moss in
one-on-one coverage. He wants a linebacker to have to cover Palmer
sliding out of the backfield. If the defense rotates toward Moss,
he wants Cris Carter covered by one defensive back. If the
defensive backs double-team Moss and Carter and the nickel back
covers Palmer, he can send tight end Andrew Glover over the middle
against a linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to create certain matchups across the board with
what we think is excellent talent,'' Billick said. ``We try to do
that formationally and through situational substitution with our
personnel. When we move people around and we get in different
configurations, we're not trying to trick someone. We're simply
looking for matchups.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's system includes stars like Cunningham, Moss and
Carter, but it is not predicated on one player, and that is what
makes it so difficult to defend against. Robert Smith is the
featured runner, but Leroy Hoard and Palmer are also important
weapons. Carter and Moss are a deadly duo, but Jake Reed makes it a
terrific threesome and Glover is also reliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian utilizes the talent and understands what he can do with
the talent,'' Carter said. ``We enjoy it. Brian could not do what
he's doing if he did not have a lot of players with the ability we
have and a lot of players who are unselfish.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like the offensive coordinator. Billick must dance around
the egos to spread the offense and to succeed. Now, Billick must
also juggle his emotions about making the present memorable for the
Vikings while his future and the sort of job that he has wanted for
three decades await him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are guys who come into the league with labels, and they
usually don't last very long,'' Green said. ``Then there are guys
that are very good fundamental coaches. I think that's what Brian
Billick is.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a coach.

CLINTON TO PROPOSE 55 CENT TAX INCREASE ON PACK OF CIGARETTES
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration plans to propose a
federal tax increase on cigarettes of 55 cents a pack to help pay
for new domestic and military spending programs, White House and
congressional officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The new tax, if enacted, would raise $8 billion a year over the
next five years and would be used to help pay for a host of new
social initiatives the president has announced over the past two
weeks, including expanded after-school programs, support for
disabled workers, hiring of new police officers and a tax credit
for people requiring long-term medical care. The money would also
help offset $100 billion in proposed new Pentagon spending over the
next six years.
</P>
<P>
   The president has not announced how he intends to pay for these
programs, promising that the details would be provided in the
budget he submits to Congress on Feb. 1. But the White House has
long signaled its intention to seek more money from tobacco, and
officials confirmed a report in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday
that Clinton will propose the tobacco tax, which is now at 24
cents, as part of a package of tax increases and loophole-closings
that it intends to push to pay for new programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to discuss in the State of the Union address next
week his administration's efforts to reduce smoking by teenagers,
including the proposed tax increase to make cigarettes too
expensive for some potential smokers.
</P>
<P>
   But the money to be raised by the new levy would not be
designated solely for anti-smoking programs, but rather to fund a
range of social initiatives, a senior White House official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is attempting to tap the deep pockets of the American
tobacco industry for the second time in a year. In last year's
budget, the president assumed that the federal government would
collect $65 billion over five years from a proposed national legal
settlement with the tobacco industry. But after an expensive
lobbying campaign by the cigarette makers, the national pact died
in the Senate and the administration realized none of the
anticipated revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The administration hopes to claim some of the $206 billion the
industry agreed late last year to pay 46 states to settle dozens of
outstanding lawsuits filed by the states seeking reimbursement for
health-care costs caused by smoking. Officials are considering
withholding a portion of state Medicaid reimbursements to recoup
part of the federal share of the expenses of smoking-related
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette companies raised prices by 45 cents a pack to pay for
the settlement with the states, driving the price of cigarettes
over $3 a pack in most markets. The administration's 55-cent
increase would be in addition to the industry's price increase and
would more than double the federal tax on cigarettes, which is
already scheduled to rise to 39 cents a pack in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee,
reacted skeptically to the administration proposal, saying it was a
part of a pattern of taxing and spending that was likely to meet
strong opposition on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said the president should cut spending in other
programs to pay for his new programs. ``Why does everything have to
be a tax hike?'' Fleischer said. ``Members of Congress on both
sides of the aisle will be troubled by how much of his budget
relies on tax and spend.''
</P>
<P>
   A tobacco industry official, speaking on condition that he not
be named, said that the cigarette makers would work to defeat the
tax proposal, as they did last year in successfully killing a
larger cigarette tax plan proposed by the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is going to fight this vigorously,'' the official
said. ``The White House has been down this road before and there
will just be a fight over it. The industry has always fought excise
taxes and it's hard to imagine after what went on last year that
our attitude will change one iota.''
</P>
<P>
   The states are also likely to object to an attempt to claim any
of the money they won from the tobacco companies, saying that the
federal government had no role in the litigation that led to the
settlement. They also are expected to argue that while $206 billion
sounds like a large sum, a substantial portion of the proceeds will
pay attorneys' fees and the remainder will not cover all the
health-care costs of treating tobacco-related illnesses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The White House still hopes to enact federal tobacco legislation
that would strengthen regulation of cigarettes while also raising
money to pay for anti-smoking campaigns, particularly those aimed
at teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials worked for a year on such
legislation, modeled on a plan negotiated by the states and the
tobacco industry, before conceding defeat last June. Clinton is
expected to renew his call for federal action against smoking in
the State of the Union, a White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite growing federal budget surpluses _ Clinton announced
earlier this month that the government would take in at least $76
billion more than it spends this year _ the administration has been
forced to scramble to come up with money to pay for a long list of
initiatives that it will include in the budget proposal it will
send to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the administration is the victim of its own success in
insisting that Congress leave the surplus untouched until the two
parties agree on a plan to shore up the Social Security system.
Moreover, both Congress and the administration remain bound by
budget rules that presumed the government would always run
deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Those rules impose tight spending caps and require that any tax
cuts or credits be offset by corresponding tax increases. The
spending caps for next year are about $30 billion less than
Congress would need to pay for all current programs _ never mind
any new ones _ and politically palatable sources of new revenue are
scarce.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the tobacco tax, Clinton plans to include a
number of other proposals to close corporate tax loopholes or
otherwise squeeze more revenue from the tax system, even though
Republicans routinely denounce them as dead on arrival.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the proposals allow Clinton to say he is
submitting a balanced budget that sets out his policy agenda.

WHITE HOUSE SEES VENDETTA IN ROLE OF `MANAGERS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While taking a hands-off approach to the Senate
impeachment trial, the White House has begun a delicate dance of
attacking the prosecutors, but not the process.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart Thursday accused the 13
House Republican ``managers,'' who are acting as prosecutors for
the Senate impeachment trial, of trying to remove President Clinton
from office as a political vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the founders intended a party that is in the
majority in the Congress could remove a president at their whim
based on partisan political differences,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he said the Republicans' 105-page legal brief
``reads like a cheap mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Clinton has said he trusts the Senate will do the
``right thing'' in his impeachment trial, while Lockhart repeatedly
uses the phrase ``good faith'' to describe the Senate's actions.
</P>
<P>
   The two-track strategy _ dogging the prosecutors while being
deferential to the jury _ has a political motivation: The Senate
has 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats, and the White House cannot
afford to alienate a single one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you want to anger the people who hold your fate in
their hands?'' asked Alan Baron, a Democratic lawyer and informal
White House adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will need at least six GOP votes in the Senate, plus all
of the Democrats to reach 51, the magic number needed to dismiss
the trial, approve a censure alternative, or limit the number of
witnesses that prosecutors can call.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, White House officials have bowed to the wishes of
their Democratic allies in the Senate, who have warned not to
tamper with the jury because that could backfire; not to seek an
immediate dimissal of the trial because that would expose the
stress lines at an early stage when senators were trying to proceed
along bipartisan lines; and not to criticize the process when
Republicans and Democrats were making an effort to work together.
</P>
<P>
   So Clinton is doing what his Democratic allies said he must do:
Continue to act presidential, because a majority of the public
believes he committed perjury and obstructed justice and still want
him to stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing for me is to spend as little time thinking
about that as possible,'' the president told reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Baron said for Clinton ``to be distracted and absorbed by the
preceedings in the Senate would indicate that they have made it
impossible for him to do the job he was elected to do. The White
House strategy is not to let that be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   James A. Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and
Presidential Studies at American University, said Clinton is likely
heeding his allies' advice by maintaing his distance from the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he's doing more praying than lobbying at this time,''
Thurber said.
</P>
<P>
   He's also doing more public events. Thursday, Clinton continued
his daily drumbeat of policy announcement to highlight initiatives
in his budget proposal and in the State of the Union address he
will deliver Tuesday, just hours after his lawyers begin their
defense in the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to stop doing what normally happens in Washington,
which is that you make speeches and talk tough and nothing
happens,'' the president said Thursday. ``I would rather say less
and do more.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of talking impeachment, he was talking crime,
traveling across the Potomac River to an Alexandria, Va., police
station, where he proposed nearly $6.4 billion in spending over
five years to continue his community policing program.
</P>
<P>
   His plans to get out of town Thursday night to attend a gala
dinner on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange were derailed by
sleet and icy rain across much of the Northeast. He is scheduled to
fly to New York Friday for a speech to the Wall Street Project, an
effort led by the Reverend Jesse Jackson to encourage more Wall
Street investment in minority interests.
</P>
<P>
   His aides said Clinton doesn't plan to spent much, if any, time
watching his impeachment trial and, Thursday worked on his State of
the Union address while the trial was being televised.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said thanks, but no thanks, to House Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde's suggestion that the Senate could
invite Clinton to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this late-hour request from Henry Hyde just once again
illustrates that this is really about politics,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Thurber, the political scientist, cautioned the White House
about going too far in its criticism of the Republican prosecutors.
``If they irritate them too much, the ire from the House spreads to
fellow members of the Senate, and that's what could be destructive
to this case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baron said the White House could decide at some point to ratchet
up its criticism of the Senate, but he thought it unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may disagree with the decision the Senate makes down the
road as far as calling witnesses,'' Baron said. ``But, certainly
when it's the Senate that has the power to deliver the ultimate
result _ conviction or acquittal, it would not seem very prudent.''

TV PRODUCERS NO MATCH FOR IMPEACHMENT TRIAL'S TEDIUM 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Senate's stationary cameras in place and trial managers
from the House of Representatives reading lengthy, detailed
presentations, television producers tried desperately Thursday to
liven up the visual and aural dullness of the impeachment trial
with graphics.
</P>
<P>
   They tried everything: Biographical details about the speakers
appeared at the bottom of the screen; video clips or photographs of
Betty Currie, Monica Lewinsky and any other players in this drama
popped up whenever they were mentioned; there was a definition of
perjury from a legal dictionary, and even shots of the Capitol dome
just because it was there.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing helped much. The broadcast networks covered the two
opening speakers as they recapped information we've been hearing
for a year, but television seemed in an uncomfortable trap, caught
between a sense of responsibility and the undeniable tedium of the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The depth of graphic triviality came when the Fox News Channel
flashed this factoid under the image of Rep. James Sensenbrenner,
R-Wis.: ``Sensenbrenner won the Taxpayers' Friend Award 1997.'' But
the most fraught information came when ABC, in a split-screen
graphic it called ``senate trial update,'' noted, ``The president
is not expected to be watching the impeachment trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Who exactly was watching? Dan Rather, signing off for CBS after
an hour and a half, cited a poll saying that only 20 per cent of
Americans are following the trial closely. President Clinton is
undoubtedly in that group whether his aides say he watches
television or not. But all the coverage, on networks and even
cable, has taken on a sense of talking into the void.
</P>
<P>
   There is no outrage involved anymore; commentators have stopped
wondering why the public is not paying better attention. There is
merely a sense of resignation. Just as the trial gets to a crucial
stage, there seems to be a loss of energy in the coverage. ``The
president's impeachment trial is about to begin again in the
Senate,'' Peter Jennings said as he began ABC's coverage, perhaps
inadvertently capturing the sense that this has become a sort of
journalistic endurance test.
</P>
<P>
   The tedium of the trial Thursday has more to do with the
familiarity of the arguments than with the way television is
capturing it. Oddly enough, without the talking heads' commentary,
the experience of watching on television was drastically duller
than watching it in person would have been. At least senators could
crane their necks and observe their colleagues' responses, which
was more than we could do. With the camera focused on the speakers,
viewers could only wonder. Were the senators fidgeting? Taking
notes? Drowsing?
</P>
<P>
   After the opening statements by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and
Sensenbrenner, CBS, ABC and NBC of offered their affiliates the
option of staying with news coverage or returning to regular shows;
the cable channels, of course, stayed on every minute. It's hard to
say viewers would have missed much by leaving, though it would have
been frightening not to have the opportunity to witness all this.
The television audience is in the position of people who live in
big cities to be near high culture but never set foot in a museum;
they feel better knowing the culture is there, just in case.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Highlighting the difference between real life legal arguments
and the swift, volatile kind we are used to on television fictions
like ``Law and Order,'' the representatives did not do much to
enliven their presentations.
</P>
<P>
   As if in deference to the Senate's image of decorum, most relied
on a low-tech visual aid, an easel and charts, in startling
contrast to the multimedia presentations made in the House of
Representatives. Only the final speaker, Rep. James Rogan,
R-Calif., relied on videotape of the president's grand jury
testimony. His presentation seemed marginally more dynamic than
others, if only because it looked familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Though the energy may have seeped out of this coverage in recent
days, reporters have become ever more sophisticated about going
behind the spin on both sides of the trial. They have remained
skeptical as senators have turned up for their usual interviews
only to claim they have no opinions because they have sworn in as
impartial jurors; until Thursday morning, senators were insisting
that there was ``bipartisan agreement,'' even as that very
agreement was crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   And as the White House insisted that the president was going
about his business, every White House reporter noted that the
president's event-a-day strategy was just that. ``The mantra is,
he's doing the nation's business,'' as Jennings put it.
</P>
<P>
   And as he went about his business, television followed as if the
cameras were monitoring a patient in intensive care, noting any
tiny change. On Wednesday, the cable channels went to the
president's White House meeting of labor leaders, at which he
answered a few questions on camera. When he was asked whether he
would mention the trial during his State of the Union address next
week, his annoyance seemed just below the surface as he drily noted
that the country had heard quite a lot about that business over the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   The hint of testiness made the State of the Union seem that much
more intriguing a theatrical event; President Clinton may be the
one player left who can add a touch of drama.

SLAIN WITNESS, MOTHER MOURNED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. _ Hours after the man he had pegged as a
potential killer was arrested for the third time in 16 months,
8-year-old Leroy Brown Jr. and his mother were bade a tearful,
final farewell Thursday night by a city stricken by pain, loss and
fear.
</P>
<P>
   The heart-rending funeral for Brown and his 30-year-old mother,
Karen Clarke, gunned down last week within feet of each other in
their North End duplex, came just 10 hours after Russell Peeler
stood silently in court, charged with possession of a stolen
shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Mother and son lay on either side of a church lecturn at the
Refuge Temple Church of God: she, in a brown casket, he, in gold
casket adorned with flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler, 27, has not been charged in the double slayings, which
have ignited a statewide debate about how Connecticut can better
protect its witnesses. But police want to question him about the
case. Brown was a key witness in an attempted murder case against
Peeler, who allegedly wounded and then, months later, shot and
killed Rudolph Snead Jr., 28, in a crowded barbershop.
</P>
<P>
   As neighbors and officials expressed relief that Peeler was
behind bars, some worried that a system that granted him freedom on
bail twice before might release him again. He was still in custody
late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the arrest of Peeler, for those who believe he's
guilty of killing these two people, puts their mind at ease,'' said
state Senator Alvin W. Penn, a Bridgeport Democrat. ``But there's a
temporary halt in the jubilance because if he came up with the
money for bail before, maybe he can get out again. I just don't
know how that can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   According to state police, Peeler was arrested early Thursday at
his father's home, where officers were seeking his brother, Adrian
Peeler, on escape charges. Instead, they said they found Russell
Peeler in possession of a stolen weapon and a small amount of
suspected drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Burton Kaplan set Peeler's bond $750,000, and said he
would be required to pay the full amount in cash to be freed.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing for that bond, prosecutor Joseph Harry noted that at
the time of his arrest, Peeler had been free on $900,000 bond on a
murder charge. He had been ordered to wear an electronic monitoring
bracelet and his attorney has denied that he was involved in
Brown's and Clarke's slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not move to revoke Peeler's bond altogether.
Harry referred all questions about the case to Bridgeport State's
Attorney Jonathan Benedict. Benedict, through a spokeswoman,
declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   As Peeler, a reputed drug dealer, was being processed in a
downtown courthouse, family and friends were preparing for the
funeral service a few miles away at the Refuge Temple Church of
God, where buses transported friends of Leroy from the after-school
program he attended when his third-grade classes at nearby Read
School let out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to chase each other around, go swimming, and play
pool. He told me he liked me and I liked him,'' said Maria Torres,
12. ``He was a nice little boy, sort of like a step-brother to me.
I feel sad....That little boy had his whole life ahead of him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Peeler's neighborhood, acquaintances _ who spoke on condition
of anonymity, saying they fear recrimination from Peeler's
associates _ expressed cautious relief about his latest
incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Allen, father of four daughters who attended Read School
with Brown, said he has had awkward conversations with them since
last week's shootings about how to act to avoid confrontation and
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told them that if you see something you've got to mind
your business,'' Allen said. ``I told them to just tell me and I'll
work it out. My oldest daughter just gave me like a blank look
like, could that really happen? I tried to explain it to her that
some people are just messed up and they don't care if it's an old
lady or a little kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Courtney Williams, pastor of Refuge Temple Church of
God who presided over the service, said as the father of young
children, the murders have touched him personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``People might tend to ask the question: Where is God in all of
this?'' Williams said before the service. ``I would say to the
community that the God that I serve is sovereign. He is always in
control. Certainly that God is not to be blamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, officials said Adrian Peeler was still being sought on
a charge of escaping from a halfway house, where he was serving a
30-month sentence for narcotics and child endangerment convictions.
Police Lt. Mathew Cuminotto Jr. said police also want to question
him about the killings of Brown and his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to question him,'' said Cuminotto. ``We want to
question everyone associated with Peeler.''
</P>
<P>
   Public defender Andrew Liskov, who represented Russell Peeler in
court Thursday, argued for a $20,000 bond. He said Peeler had not
been convicted of either crime with which he is charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he is a risk to the community,'' Liskov said,
adding: ``I'm not sure what the intent of the police was, but all I
can say is that this arrest warrant was one of the weakest I've
seen in a long time. The state will be very hard-pressed to prove
the case.''

AUSTIN LETTERS TO GO ON SALE FOR $1.25 MILLION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A packet of letters written by the so-called ``Father of
Texas,'' Stephen F. Austin, to key civil and military leaders of
the Texas Revolution will go on sale Friday in New York City for
$1.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the 13 letters, Austin, the impresario largely responsible
for settling Anglo-Americans inside Mexican Texas, grows from a
cautious businessman content with Mexican rule to a revolutionary
firebrand. The transformation occurs over a six-year period
beginning in 1830.
</P>
<P>
   The letters, addressed to Jim Bowie, James Fannin and David
Burnet, are described by the seller as among the ``most
remarkable'' Texas documents ever offered for public sale. They are
believed to be the only Austin letters not owned by libraries.
</P>
<P>
   In writing to Burnet, who would become the republic's first
president, Austin at first urges only a position for Texas as a
separate state in the Mexican republic.
</P>
<P>
   But upon learning of Texas' March 2, 1836, declaration of
independence, a revolutionized Austin crows: ``Independence or
death must be our motto.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The work we now have on hand is to raise &AMP; put together the
superstructure _ to elevate the temple of liberty in that new
country, to regulate all its parts _ in short to form a new govt.
on principles that will prove to the world that the motto `Light of
Liberty,' is real &AMP; not merely theoretic,'' he wrote in the same
letter.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's missives to Bowie and Fannin instruct them in the siege
that resulted in the capture of San Antonio and its fortress, the
Alamo, in December 1835. Santa Anna, whose ascension to power
Austin initially favored and whose name he often misspelled,
recaptured the Alamo in March 1836.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Alamo's fall, a devastated Austin wrote, ``Travis, brave
Travis &AMP; his heroic band _ but my feeling will not allow me to
dwell.''
</P>
<P>
   In yet another letter, Austin offers his strangely elaborate
design _ never adopted _ for a Republic of Texas flag. It
incorporated elements of Mexican, U.S. and early Texas flags and
featured a blazing sun, a portrait of George Washington and a motto
in Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's final letter was written from New York on April 23,
1836 _ two days after Sam Houston's victory at San Jacinto, of
which Austin was unaware.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extraordinarily important collection,'' said
Massachusetts rare document dealer Kenneth Rendell, who is offering
the letters for sale at the 45th Annual Winter Antiques Show in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this collection transcends regional boundaries.
Everyone is interested in the American frontier. The pioneer spirit
is what America is about. From Austin to Boston, everyone knows
about Stephen F. Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Rendell said, the letters would have been shown during
private consultations with prospective buyers. But with the 10-day
New York show, the premier antiques venue in the nation, opening
today, Rendell said he decided to use the letters to create
excitement over his other offerings. Already, he said, several
potential buyers from Texas have expressed interest in the letters.
</P>
<P>
   The offering of the Austin letters marks the second time in
little more than two months that important Texas history documents
have been up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the diary of a Mexican soldier who witnessed the
fall of the Alamo _ and Davy Crockett's execution _ sold for
$350,000 at a Los Angeles auction. It later was donated to the
Center for American History, a University of Texas library, in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The UT library, Austin's Texas State Library and the Rosenberg
Library in Galveston hold the other major collections of Austin
letters and documents.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said the letters now offered for sale belonged to the
Burnet family until the 1950s, when they were sold to a collector
of rare documents. That collector's heirs _ who were not identified
_ now have opted to sell them, Rendell said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Cantrell, a history professor at Hardin-Simmons University
in Abilene and author of a biography of Austin to be released this
summer by Yale University Press, said he doubted the letters would
bring more than a fraction of their asking price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are very nice letters,'' he said. ``They're
meaty, but they don't contain things that aren't available in other
letters. You could write a biography without citing any of these.
Austin was very prolific. He tried to persuade lots of other people
... Burnet was just one of many.''
</P>
<P>
   The letters offered for sale are available to scholars in
published form, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, said Center for American History director Don Carleton,
possession of the original documents is a boon to researchers.
``You can never be 100 percent certain that a printed version of (a
handwritten) document is accurate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While his library would welcome donation of the letters, it will
not attempt to buy them, he said. Like other documents aimed at the
collector market, the letters' price places them well beyond the
center's means, Carleton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a commodity like anything else,'' he said of the packet
of letters. ``It's worth what anyone's willing to pay for it. There
are market values _ and then there are intellectual or research
values. A collector's market is a very idiosyncratic market and
some of these decisions are rational and some aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Cantrell noted that the asking price for the 13 letters almost
triples the ``paper'' value of Austin's estate when he died of
pneumonia at age 43 in December 1836.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of his wealth was in land. It was valued at $3 an acre,
but probably wasn't worth more than 30 cents an acre. Something
like $50,000 was in receivable accounts, which never would be
collected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin was a `millionaire on paper,' but every time he needed
a few thousand dollars, he pretty much had to scramble.''
</P>

THE HUTCHINSON BROTHERS ARE UNITED BY THE BUSINESS OF IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark.)  (js) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a sight that would have made any Republican
mother proud.
</P>
<P>
   There was Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., pointing to his
blue-and-yellow charts and graphs, leading the Senate through the
obstruction of justice case maze that House prosecutors say helped
lead to President Clinton's impeachment: The gifts Clinton received
from Monica Lewinsky, her job search, his wink-and-nod suggestions
to his secretary Betty Currie that he and Ms. Lewinsky had never
been alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know in life one lie leads to another,'' Hutchinson, a
former U.S. attorney in Arkansas, told the 100 senators sitting
stiffly in front of him. ``Well, so it is when we attempt to thwart
the administration of justice. One obstruction leads to another.''
</P>
<P>
   To his left, toward the back of the ornate chamber, Sen. Tim
Hutchinson of Arkansas listened intently to his younger brother
explain one of the two articles of impeachment the Senate will vote
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so far over in the corner I couldn't find him,'' Asa
Hutchinson said about his brother, the senator.
</P>
<P>
   It was a presentation that Sen. Ted Stevens, an Alaska
Republican and chairman of the Appropriations Committee, a man not
prone to dishing out kudos, described as a ``tremendous job of
connecting the dots. It was very good.''
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Judiciary Committee, Asa Hutchinson voted to
impeach Clinton in December and has been privy to information that
has never been released by the panel or rebutted by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   If some Democrats had had their way, Asa Hutchinson would have
never been appointed as one of the 13 House managers, or
prosecutors, laying out the House case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The two brothers are so close (they were born only 16 months
apart _ Asa is 48, Tim is 49) they share a Pentagon City, Va.
apartment. Both of them are conservative Republicans, although
Hutchinson the senator is a bit more ideological than Hutchinson
the representative, who wound up running for the House seat his
brother vacated in 1992 to become a senator.
</P>
<P>
   These blood ties have prompted a few Democrats to fret that one
brother could improperly influence the other.
</P>
<P>
   But the brothers say that nothing could be further from the
truth. ``We don't talk about the facts of the case,'' Tim
Hutchinson said.
</P>
<P>
   During the past few weeks, while Hutchinson the senator tended
to Senate business or plopped down with a good book to read,
Hutchinson the representative secluded himself in the second
bedroom, thumbing through impeachment documents as he tried to
weave the thread of obstruction of justice from Clinton to his
aides and cabinet and to Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Asa Hutchinson has already prosecuted one Clinton, Roger
Clinton, the president's brother, on drug charges in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The one pledge Asa Hutchinson did make to his brother Thursday
morning is that he would keep his presentation interesting. ``I
said I'd do my best not to make it boring,'' Asa Hutchinson said.

   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Argentine interest rates surged
Thursday as the local stock market tumbled for a second day in
response to the devaluation of Brazil's currency. But several
senior Argentine officials pledged that they would not budge the
peso from its one-to-one linkage to the dollar or veer from other
free-market policies.
</P>
<P>
   President Carlos Saul Menem projected calm as he returned from a
state visit in the United States, appearing on national television
smiling and dressed in a sport shirt and slacks. ``This will pass
quickly,'' he said, even as he summoned his Cabinet for an
emergency meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Argentines did not panic despite alarming headlines in the local
financial press, with economists reporting almost no withdrawal of
deposits from local banks over the last two days. But foreign
investors continued to sell Argentine stocks heavily, with
Argentina's Merval index opening the day sharply lower even as
Brazil's Bovespa was showing early, tentative signs of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Merval, which plunged 10.2 percent Wednesday, fell another
4.3 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's economy is closely linked to Brazil's because 30
percent of its exports go to its northern neighbor. With the
devaluation of the Brazilian currency, the real, Argentine goods
will become less competitive on the Brazilian market and high
interest rates are likely to further limit the buying power of
Brazilian consumers. Private economists predicted that a coming
economic contraction _ particularly in the auto, steel and cement
industries _ would lower corporate earnings, squeeze tax receipts,
and force the government to reduce spending in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the Brazilian crisis has been immediate, with the
prime interest rate for private businesses rising from 11 percent
to more than 13 percent overnight. Meanwhile, even as government
officials spoke optimistically of the future, they held off plans
to issue a new global bond and privatize part of the National
Mortgage Bank until international capital markets calmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Argentine economy will react with a deep recession,''
predicted Dario Lizzano, head of equity research at Santander
Investments in Buenos Aires. ``There will be a lack of credit and
that will generate a strong increase in interest rates at least in
the short term.'' Gustavo Canonero, a senior economist at Deutsche
Morgan Grenfell in Buenos Aires, said, ``In this volatile economy,
you will see the Merval continue to be weak.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in an interview, Deputy Economy Minister Pablo Guidotti
sketched out a brighter scenario. ``At this point, it is still
early to say the current situation in Brazil will delay our
recovery,'' he said. ``Brazil's problems now mean a closing of
capital markets and increasing our country risk premium, but this
will have no lasting affect if the situation in Brazil is
short-lived.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Brazil's devaluation, many Wall Street and local
economists have revised their forecasts for the Argentine economy
in 1999, from 2.5 percent growth to zero or even a contraction
after nearly a decade of almost uninterrupted expansion. Most
economists say the 12.4 percent unemployment rate is likely to go
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, independent economists and political analysts said
they believed Menem would not veer off his free-market course, in
part because it now appeared certain that he would not be a
candidate for re-election later this year. And since Menem is a
sworn enemy of the likely presidential candidate of the ruling
Justicialist Party, the Buenos Aires Governor, Eduardo Duhalde,
most observers feel it is unlikely he will be tempted to return to
old populist policies to promote his party's cause.
</P>
<P>
   The linchpin of Menem's economic policy has been the peg of the
peso to the dollar, known to economists as ``convertibility.'' The
currency peg is set by law and prohibits the government from
issuing new money unless new pesos are backed by dollars or gold
reserves in the central bank.
</P>
<P>
   The peg, instituted in 1991, reduced Argentina's inflation rate
from more than 2,000 percent to single digits almost immediately.
The peg withstood intense pressure after the devaluation of the
Mexican peso in December 1994. Economists also noted that the
Argentine economy had been strengthened in recent years by tighter
government banking regulations that raised mandatory bank reserve
requirements. At worst, in the event of a huge, prolonged Brazilian
devaluation, economists said Argentine could replace the pesos
completely with dollars.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the use of dollars in everyday commerce has become
increasingly common in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   However, Guidotti said no drastic measures would be needed. He
said the government was sticking to its projection of 2.5 percent
to 3 percent growth in 1999. He also said that a recent 60 percent
cut in business taxes destined for social security expenses would
keep the unemployment rate from rising.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, Economy Minister Roque Fernandez
said, ``There will not be a devaluation.'' He added, ``There is not
the slightest doubt our economy can overcome these difficulties.''

COMMENTARY: WE'RE ALL ONE RIVER
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are some who will tell you that 1999 will be remembered as
the year of Clinton, Starr and Lewinsky. Wrong. This remarkable
year will be remembered a decade from now as the year of the Amazon
_ the cyber-river and the real river, Amazon.com and
Amazon.country, also known as Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Those two rivers are flip sides of the same coin, and the coin
is globalization. The incredible run-up in the stock price of
Amazon.com and the incredible run-down in the stock markets of
Amazon.country, i.e., Brazil, are both reflections of investors
trying to figure out what companies and countries will be worth in
this new era of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Amazon.com, which sells books and CDs over the
Internet, some people think it's worth $5 a share and some think
it's worth $500. How can that be? Well, investors who have rushed
to buy Amazon.com stock (personally, I own none) have the basic
trend right. And the trend is that the Internet is going to define
how we communicate, how we invest and how we conduct commerce.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, I believe there are going to be just two kinds of
companies _ Internet companies and anti-Internet companies.
Internet companies will be those whose business can be conducted
over, or greatly enhanced by, the Internet. This is everyone from
booksellers to consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Internet companies will be those whose businesses either
cannot be conducted on the Internet _ giving haircuts or making
steel _ or those whose businesses will benefit from the fact that
the more people are home alone with their Internet, the more they
will want to get out and touch something, smell something, feel
something, taste something and soak up some community. This
includes Starbucks, movie theaters, amusement parks and shopping
centers (stock I do own).
</P>
<P>
   But while the buyers of Amazon.com have the general trend right,
whether Amazon.com is actually worth $148 a share before it's ever
made a dime of profit depends on how you see the future. The
Amazon.com bulls believe that there is a huge race going on right
now for everyone's credit card. The race is between a number of
major online retailers _ AOL, Amazon, Yahoo, Excite, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption is that all of these sites will eventually become
full-service online shopping centers that will sell everything, and
that you will give your credit card number to one or two of them _
where you will do most of your shopping _ but to fewer than five of
them. Therefore, if Amazon.com is one of those winning sites, its
profits will be enormous. It will be an online shopping mall for
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Amazon.com bears, and I'm one, believe that the problem with
online retailing is that the barriers to entry are so low _ with
$100,000 I could start a rival Amazon.com tomorrow _ that there
will always be one too many competitors making sure that Amazon's
profit margins never get as big as people project. Amazon.com
offers 30 percent off almost every hardcover. So Barnesandnoble.com
matches that, and then Buy.com comes along and offers best sellers
at 50 percent off. Buy.com's founder told USA Today he has no
intention of ever making money selling books, but just wants to
build up volume to sell ads.
</P>
<P>
   As for Amazon.country, Brazil, it's been trying to cut its
budget and streamline its economy to make itself an attractive site
for global investors. Brazil wants to be a major economic power but
it doesn't have the savings or the technology to reach the first
rank, so it needs the global markets.
</P>
<P>
   But to make Brazil attractive to global investors requires some
painful internal reforms and a shrinking of the country's social
safety net, which is proving politically explosive. And Brazil
knows that if it doesn't do what the global herd demands, the herd
will just move to Thailand.country or Mexico.country.
</P>
<P>
   What Amazon.com and Amazon.country are telling us is that the
next phase of globalization is going to be a real bear. It's going
to squeeze the profit margins of every company that does business
over the Internet, which will be great for consumers and a terror
for producers. And it's going to squeeze the politics of developing
countries even tighter, which is going to be tough on their
citizens and a terror for their politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's 228-point drop in the Dow, because of the economic
turmoil in Brazil, is just a small reminder that life on the real
Amazon still matters, and it can, and will, affect life on the
banks of Amazon.com.

NOTHING NEW OFFERED IN SENATE TRIAL, EXPERTS AGREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the idea was to win a few jurors' hearts,
capture their imaginations, or even change some minds, the
prosecutors failed miserably Thursday as they began presenting
their case against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they performed brilliantly.
</P>
<P>
   There seemed to be no in-between opinion among legal scholars
and attorneys who watched the opening day of the second
presidential impeachment trial in US history. Whatever they
thought, however, they agreed on one thing: Nobody, in the Senate
chamber or in the public at large, heard anything new.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that this has got to be a lot more than simply
a rehash of what they've already gone over and what everyone
already knows,'' said Robert Bloom, a professor of criminal and
civil procedure at Boston University Law School. ``The Republicans'
only hope is to get witnesses, because they won't get the votes ...
if nothing more interesting happens.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the nicest thing that a majority of those interviewed
had to say about the style of the House managers and the substance
of their case. Among those who discussed the issue, defense
attorneys were particularly harsh in their assessments.
</P>
<P>
   They lambasted the Republican presenters for breaking a cardinal
rule in civil and criminal trials: offering arguments and launching
attacks, rather than providing recitations of fact and previews of
evidence to come. And they said that _ except for Representative
Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, who won high marks for his flare and
speaking style _ the prosecutors were so dull that they were
unlikely to keep many people's attention, much less affect their
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're crummy trial lawyers _ they read their notes, they
don't make eye contact, they don't give you anything emotional or
factual to latch onto,'' said John Henry Hingson 3d, an Oregon
attorney and a past president of the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's lame,'' added Gerald Lefcourt, a New York attorney, in a
separate interview. ``They don't differentiate between evidence and
speculation. They basically said they want to remove the president
from office based on what they think happened, rather than what
they can prove. It's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts offered far more positive reviews of the
prosecutors' presentations.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed, for instance, that overt efforts to sway jurors are
usually confined to closing arguments, rather than opening
statements. But they said that simply underscored how radically
different the impeachment process is from other legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' often legalistic, precedent-citing choice of
words also separated them from counterparts in other courtrooms.
Prosecutors and defense attorneys tend to use simpler language _
except, perhaps, when talking to the judge.
</P>
<P>
   And that, legal scholars pointed out, demonstrates yet another
way in which the jurors in this case are unique: In many respects,
they also are judges and so are treated as such.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ordinarily, you try to avoid words like prior or subsequent
and use words like before and after,'' said F. Dennis Saylor, a
Boston attorney who was chief of staff at the Justice Department's
criminal division in the Bush administration. ``The point you want
to make is he said these things, they weren't true, it violates the
law, and what more is there to talk about?''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph diGenova, a former federal prosecutor, said the
prosecutors' critics had missed a huge point. He asserted that the
House managers had cleverly calculated a way to restructure the
well-chronicled information in the case to ``make it clear just how
damaging it is to President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   DiGenova said they did that by outlining the
obstruction-of-justice evidence first, then moving on to the
perjury count lodged against Clinton. Placed in that sequence,
according to diGenova, the president's misstatements will be viewed
in the context of an elaborate illegal enterprise rather than just
an attempt to hide his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, they have done a superb job of laying out all the
facts, back to back, end to end,'' said diGenova.
</P>
<P>
   While describing the prosecutors as generally boring and
unconvincing, Ira Reiner, a former prosecutor in Los Angeles,
echoed diGenova's assessment. ``The arguments have essentially a
single theme, and virtually everything said is built around it,
Reiner said. ``The House men are trying to rebut what is clearly
the general view, right or wrong, that lying under oath about a
sexual affair doesn't constitute grounds for removing a
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who discussed the impeachment trial Thursday agreed
that another critical goal of the Republican managers' strategy was
to pave the way for calling witnesses. Some even joked that the
prosecutors deliberately went over old ground so that senators will
want to call witnesses just for the chance to learn something new.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Johnson, a prominent Boston attorney, was among those who
said the House prosecutors run a risk by going on at length. That
is, that they won't change anyone's mind but could make the
senators anxious to end the whole process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The managers are simply wasting the time of the senators by
repeating over and over again opinions of the facts which have yet
to be proven in an attempt to convince the Senate that the
credibility of the president is lacking,'' said Johnson. ``They're
a consummate waste of time.''

COMMENTARY: THE U.N. SUICIDE ROAD
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Behind the closed doors of the U.N. Security Council, three of
America's major partners are closing fast on their goal: to give
Saddam Hussein victory in the war he lost eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The victory would not just establish Iraqi dominance in the
Mideast, it would threaten the pragmatic reality of the Western
alliance and America's role in it. And in words I choose with
unhappy care: It would bring into vivid danger the purpose and
existence of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the countries _ France, Russia and China _ has worked
long at those closed meetings to kill the oil embargo against Iraq,
the only barrier that prevents Saddam from again building arsenals
of nuclear, chemical and bacteriological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   All three want to resume oil and industrial trade with Iraq.
They are also bound by desire to build Mideast influence, squeezing
out America's.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, France went public, proposing to lift the oil
embargo. It was imposed by the United Nations for as long as Saddam
keeps refusing to reveal his hidden weapons of mass destruction and
his capacity to build more.
</P>
<P>
   By his own decision, the embargo imposes suffering on Iraqis. He
will not even give them ease by spending all the relief money the
United Nations allows.
</P>
<P>
   France has surrendered to his choice and with great spirit spits
in America's face.
</P>
<P>
   The French have this terrific idea: After the embargo is lifted,
the United Nations would kind of watch to see if Saddam bought or
built the weapons. But it would end all the inspection that now
stops him beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   The United States said it stood by the embargo, but sent shivers
through Saddam's enemies by saying the French proposal had ``some
positive elements.'' President Clinton has had no policy toward
Iraq for his six years in office, except a couple of bomb-and-run
bombings, which made Americans look like fools and cowards.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly at the United Nations we have proved the former.
Council meetings were open for the first two decades of the United
Nations, and the public could see and hear what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   You can see that was an annoyance for diplomats. So they closed
the meetings. They threw the press a few briefing bones after the
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, who would not let a village council meet in private
about a school budget, allow Washington to agree that the U.N.
Security Council should meet in private about issues of death or
life, including ours.
</P>
<P>
   For much of my career, I have been involved in U.N. coverage _ a
decade of writing about it before I escaped to foreign places, then
more decades of involvement back in New York as an editor and
columnist.
</P>
<P>
   I believed, and still do, that even with its failures,
weaknesses and bouts of lickspittle about dictatorships, the United
Nations could be a force for social decency and democracy. I am
embarrassed that my country will not pay its dues _ something that
I would never have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   For many months I have been writing about the pro-Saddam
tripartite alliance, while Washington told us how strong the
anti-Saddam ``consensus'' was at the United Nations. That escaped
perjury because nobody put a hand on the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, I am alone in my criticism. American ``opinion makers''
rarely set foot in an organization that affects U.S. national
interests around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The guilt in the plot to rebuild Saddam rests mostly with the
nations that hatch and nest it. But it lies too with U.S.
ineffectiveness and with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's praise of Saddam and defensive attitude toward him may
come from some concept of peacemaking. But they damage him and the
United Nations more than he seems to know.
</P>
<P>
   So, very carefully, I want to tell him, and all who have any
hopeful interest in the United Nations, that it is traveling the
suicide road.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations was created to expand freedom on the defeat
of Germany, Japan and Italy, not to strengthen other tyrannies or
create new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Dictatorships hold seats at the United Nations. But their values
and interests are contrary and fatal to those on which the United
Nations was founded _ the preservation and growth of liberty.
</P>
<P>
   If the United Nations removes restraints it imposed itself on
the resurgence of Saddam Hussein, restoring him as a threat to the
existence of millions of people, free or tyrannized, it will have
prostituted its own purpose and meaning.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations will have no reason to exist and will leave
few to weep at its burial.

TURKEY'S EX-PREMIER CILLER IN COMEBACK AS POWER BROKER
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Cars were parked two-deep over the weekend
outside the waterfront mansion of former Prime Minister Tansu
Ciller. Bodyguards strolled back and forth as they waited for their
bosses to emerge from urgent political strategy sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Monday it became clear that the sessions had borne fruit. Ms.
Ciller had once again returned from the brink of oblivion to become
one of Turkey's most important power brokers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a remarkable turnaround, even for a politician already
known for her resilience. Only a few months ago, Ms. Ciller was
being investigated on corruption accusations so serious that some
believed she would not only fall from power but also be imprisoned
or forced into exile. Now she is a kingmaker who, in the space of
two weeks, has broken one potential prime minister and made
another.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the last few days of political maneuvering here
prepared by Suleyman Tombul, a leading financial analyst, was
headlined: ``And the Winner Is ... Tansu Ciller!''
</P>
<P>
   Some Turks view Ms. Ciller, who has denied all wrongdoing, as
cynical and mendacious. Others admire her tenacity and ability to
defy the political odds.
</P>
<P>
   When she burst onto the political scene in the late 1980s, Ms.
Ciller (pronounced CHILL-er) was widely viewed as a savior. She was
young, female and Western-educated, a seemingly perfect leader for
a country eager to be taken seriously as an emerging power.
</P>
<P>
   But her record as prime minister in the early 1990s disappointed
many of her supporters. The economy suffered a sharp decline, and
death squads emerged as part of the campaign against Kurdish
separatists and their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   After being forced from office in 1995, Ms. Ciller remained
chairman of the center-right True Path Party. Last year she and the
prime minister at the time, Mesut Yilmaz, her bitter rival, made a
deal to support parliamentary motions closing corruption
investigations aimed at both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Yilmaz was toppled in a no-confidence vote Nov. 25, and for a
time it looked as if one of Ms. Ciller's sharpest critics, Yalim
Erez, would succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   She apparently concluded that she had to stop Erez, since as a
former member of her party he had the potential to win party
members to his side and perhaps even force her out of the party
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In a maneuver that astonished the political elite, Ms. Ciller
suddenly announced that she would throw her support behind leftist
leader Bulent Ecevit, with whom she has little in common
politically. Erez's incipient government quickly collapsed, and
Ecevit formed one instead.
</P>
<P>
   Political cartoonists had a field day with this turn of events.
One depicted Ms. Ciller as Brutus stabbing Erez, dressed as Julius
Caesar. Another showed Ecevit presiding over a meeting of his new
Cabinet, with Ms. Ciller kneeling under the table and supporting it
on her back.
</P>
<P>
   The price of Ms. Ciller's backing for Ecevit soon became clear.
The man he had chosen as education minister, a strong secularist
who had served in the departing government, was given another
portfolio at the last moment.
</P>
<P>
   Many devout Muslims detest the minister, Hikmet Ulugbay, for his
policies curbing religious academies and banning head scarfs at
universities.
</P>
<P>
   During the last election campaign in 1995, Ms. Ciller, who is in
her mid-50s, though her exact age is obscure, ran as a secularist
and warned that the Islamic political movement would lead Turkey
into ``a thousand years of darkness.'' Soon afterward, however, she
joined with Islamic leaders in a new government and was
photographed wearing a head scarf.
</P>
<P>
   Now, evidently eager to win votes from practicing Muslims, Ms.
Ciller can claim to be the figure who deposed a secularist
education minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``By forcing the replacement of Ulugbay, she will now be able to
say at rallies, `I am the one who removed the minister who shut
down religious academies!''' one newspaper columnist wrote.
</P>
<P>
   As further conditions for her support of Ecevit, she also
persuaded him to replace the ministers of justice and
transportation with allies of hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had been on the defensive, and she launched a very shrewd
and successful counterattack,'' said Asaf Savas Akat, an expert on
Turkish politics who teaches economics at Bilgi University in
Istanbul. ``She's looking for support from rural voters and those
who oppose the secular establishment. But at the same time she's
losing the urban voters. She scored a victory, but I don't think
her troubles are over.''

<P>
   ABOARD THE PRIDE OF DOVER, in the English Channel _ The white
cliffs of Dover looked particularly fine as the ferry sped toward
France, but the tourists, swarming through the duty-free shops on
board like locusts on parole, were not interested in the view. They
had only 75 minutes. They had to shop quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Garner and John Hall, police officers bound for Euro Disney
with their families, were stocking up on cigarettes and beer.
Margaret Couch and her daughter, Donna Dickman, heading for France
for a day's shopping in Calais, were rifling through the designer
sweatshirts.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Kerr and his sister, Pauline, were explaining how they
could save a bundle on supplies for a wake for their recently
deceased father by shopping on the boat and in France, where prices
are cheaper, and then coming home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want it to be a festive leave-taking,'' Mr. Kerr said,
putting a bottle of whisky in his basket.
</P>
<P>
   Not too many years ago, cross-Channel ferries were used mainly
for one thing, ferrying passengers between Britain and the
Continent. But because of steep competition from airlines and from
the trains that run through the Channel Tunnel, the ferries have
had to lower their prices drastically, and to look elsewhere for
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they have turned into floating duty-free shopping
centers, discount malls on the water, places where the Channel's
famously bad weather and stomach-churning waves are canceled out by
the joy of mass spending.
</P>
<P>
   For the consumer, freed from the burden of having to pay the
various taxes the government imposes on luxuries like cigarettes
and alcohol, as well as the 17.5 percent value added tax it places
on most goods, the savings are impressive _ even though each
passenger is allowed only a certain amount of alcohol and
cigarettes per trip.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Duty-Free Confederation, an industry lobbying
group, a carton of 200 Silk Cut cigarettes, which would cost $52.70
in a normal British store, costs $25.30 on the ferry. A liter
bottle of Gordon's gin sells for $13, down from $25.25.
</P>
<P>
   But the $1.6 billion-a-year British duty-free industry may well
be living on borrowed time. Eight years ago, the European
Commission decreed that as part of the European Union's drive
toward harmonization, it would eventually abolish duty-free
shopping between European countries.
</P>
<P>
   If the commission makes good on its pledge, while passengers to
countries outside the European Union would still be able to buy
discounted perfume, chocolates and handbags, those traveling within
Europe would see such opportunities disappear in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   No more discounted Hermes scarves at Charles de Gaulle Airport
in Paris. No more cheap last-minute gifts from the Harrods outlet
at Heathrow, calculated to make your husband think you'd
thoughtfully shopped at the actual store.
</P>
<P>
   Zero hour was set for the end of June 1999, and there seems to
be little that anyone can do to stop it. In December, Prime
Minister Tony Blair of Britain said his government would join with
France and Germany, which both oppose the change, to try to find a
way around it. But without the support of the rest of the European
Union countries, it is doubtful whether they will get very far.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments against duty-free shopping within the new, unified
Europe are simple. If borders between Europe are all but dissolved,
the thinking goes, then why preserve an anachronistic throwback, a
vestige from the days when the borders were serious things and
traveling from one European country to another was as laden with
red tape as traveling to the United States? And why should one
group of people have to subsidize the purchases of another group,
who happen to pass through an airport?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time that people who do not travel stopped having to pay
for the boondoggles and beanos of those who do,'' Andrew Mackinlay,
a Labor member of Parliament, declared in a House of Commons debate
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   But his was a lone voice of dissent, drowned out as politicians
from all parts of the political spectrum rushed to defend the
inalienable right of Britons to buy cheap luxury goods while on
vacation. Supporting duty-free shopping is a popular political
position, of course: what politician in his right mind would want
to go on the record as meanly opposing his constituents' right to

   Member after member rose to describe the number of jobs that
would be lost at airports, ports and in the travel and liquor
industries if duty-free shopping were abandoned _ by one estimate,
30,000 in Britain alone. They spoke of the tedium of traveling, of
the triumph that comes from buying goods at a discount, of the
feeling that duty-free shopping is a right, not a privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Bill O'Brien, a Labor member of Parliament, read aloud a letter
from a constituent, one Mrs. C. Eason. ``Duty-free shopping is part
of the fun of going on holiday,'' she said. ``Everyone likes to
think they are `getting a bargain.' ''
</P>

<P>
   A Conservative colleague, David Wilshire, argued that duty-free
shopping gave people something to do at the airport. ``My main
justification, trivial as it may seem, has always been that it is a
harmless bit of fun in an otherwise dull world that gets duller by
the week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Raymond Limbert, picking up a case of cigarettes for
a friend aboard the ferry, thinks, too. ``I much prefer to shop
when I take these trips,'' he said. ``When you go through the
tunnel, you're just stuck there.''
</P>
<P>
   If the government abolished duty-free shopping, he said, ferries
and package-tour operators would inevitably raise their prices,
cramping the style not only of shoppers but also of vacationers
accustomed to the low fares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only place in Europe that's on an island,'' he said,
``and this keeps us able to go to Europe cheaply.''
</P>
<P>
   Next door in the cosmetics department, the woman behind the
counter said she couldn't believe duty-free shopping would ever
disappear. ``It's a multibillion-dollar industry, and they're not
going to give it up,'' she said, looking nervously around in case
her supervisor was eavesdropping.
</P>
<P>
   She gestured at a pair of women, scooping little pots of
anti-wrinkle cream into their shopping baskets. ``Just look at
them,'' she said. ``If they couldn't shop, what would they do
instead?''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader,
seems poised to forgo a run for president and try instead to get
more Democrats elected to the House next year so that he can become
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, a 12-term Missourian, has given himself until the end
of January to announce his decision. His aides say he has not made
up his mind, but all signs point to his staying in the House.
</P>
<P>
   It now appears evident that he all but arrived at that decision
once the Democrats unexpectedly picked up five House seats in
November. But the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton
complicated and delayed a final determination.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gephardt's years of preparation for a presidential run,
he remains well behind Vice President Al Gore in fund raising,
organization and public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the November elections put the Democrats'
chances of recapturing the House tantalizingly close. Toward that
end, Gephardt has already redeployed two of his political aides _
David Plouffe, who was working for him in Iowa, and Erik Smith from
his House staff _ to the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, which oversees the party's House election efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Gephardt's chief supporters say he is so personally
invested in the House that they cannot imagine his walking away now
that the Democrats need only six more seats to regain a majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can read the historical moment that we're in right now,''
said Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., who heads the campaign
committee. ``His undivided attention in helping us secure a
majority is the single greatest thing he can do for the party. The
math is there. And his heart has always been with the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Other friends say Gephardt is putting off an announcement while
he comes to terms with the realization that although he is riding a
surge of popularity among House Democrats, it does not necessarily
prevail among the voting public. That is, he has a better chance of
becoming speaker than becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's frustrated because his stock is at an all-time high and
he can't take advantage of that,'' said one Democrat who knows him
well. ``He can't cash it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Said another friend: ``He's walking through the mental process
and trying to come to terms with it. He has not quite come to the
place where he can say, `I'm not going to run.'''
</P>
<P>
   But, this friend added, ``I don't think he's running.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult,'' the friend said, ``to take on an
incumbent vice president who can raise all the money he needs,''
and if Gephardt lost, he would probably have a big debt to pay off.
``It's not easy to find new thousand-dollar donors once you're out
of a race,'' a lesson Gephardt learned after his one earlier run
for president, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Already a longtime Gephardt fund-raiser, Lou Susman, an
investment banker, has thrown his support to another presidential
campaign, that of former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt had been making some of the moves for another run. He
long ago distanced himself from Clinton and Gore on issues like
fast-track trade legislation, and last year he began to build a
case against the administration by delivering a speech in which he
criticized them for turning the Democratic Party into ``a money
machine.'' Last summer he called Clinton's personal conduct
``reprehensible'' and raised the possibility that the president
would be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened on the way to impeachment. As the
partisan battle intensified in the fall, Gephardt, out of a need to
hold his own caucus together, emerged as one of the
administration's most effective tacticians. While Republicans
focused on Clinton's behavior, Gephardt shifted attention to
procedure and matters of fairness. He kept House Democrats united
through several turbulent weeks of impeachment theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   The November election results, meanwhile, gave the party fresh
hope, and Gephardt capped the impeachment ordeal by delivering on
the House floor a conciliatory speech applauded by Democrats and
Republicans alike.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's supporters say his performance over these last few
months has prompted more people within the party to urge him to run
for president. But they also acknowledge that the gains of autumn
put the Democrats so close to recapturing the House that he all but
made up his mind in November to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment set the timetable back a bit, because more people
are talking to him,'' one loyalist said. ``He needs to feel he's
exhausted this.''
</P>
<P>
   To outside observers, the logical move is for Gephardt to go for
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would he take on a losing battle against Gore,'' said
James Davis, a political scientist at Washington University in St.
Louis, ``when all along he would prefer to be speaker and he could
have Gore's good will at the White House?''

FLORIDA DENIES FUNDING FOR HIGH-SPEED RAIL PROJECT
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Plans for a high-speed train that would link Florida's
three major metropolitan areas appeared dead after Gov. Jeb Bush
pulled out state financing Thursday, saying the project posed too
much financial risk for taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his first decisions as governor, Bush announced that
he would withhold money for the rail project in his 1999-2000
budget and not seek the release of money previously appropriated
for work related to the train. The state has already spent $22.4
million of the more than $2 billion it had earmarked for the $6.3
billion project. A federal loan and private money would have
financed the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, the project does appear to be canceled,'' said
Lisa Boyette, a spokeswoman for Fluor Daniel, an American
engineering and construction company that was part of the private
international consortium known as the Florida Overland Express, the
state's financial partner in the project.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who met with the project's representatives and his
economic development transition team before making his decision,
cited concerns like a lack of consensus about ridership
projections, the environmental impact and costs that are ``still
considered a moving target.'' With billions of public dollars at
stake and uncertainty about whether enough Floridians would ride
the train to make it a success, he said, the money would best be
spent on other transportation needs.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in the Legislature, which is led by Republicans,
supported the decision, or at least a re-evaluation of the project.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The uncertainty and risk to Florida's taxpayers are too great
to continue funding this project with our tax dollars,'' the
governor said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this funding could go toward finding creative ways to
transport our state's working poor and welfare-to-work participants
to jobs, assist our urban communities with congestion and promote
projects that would link our airports and seaports to enhance
trade, commerce and economic competitiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has called high-speed rail the
missing link in the national transportation system and had lauded
Florida for being the first state to pledge such a significant
amount of public money to the effort.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday following Bush's announcement, Federal
Railroad Administrator Jolene Molitoris said, ``The Clinton
administration supports high-speed rail and believes it is a
crucial component of transportation in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts in other states have repeatedly failed to obtain
financing, and Florida, which authorized the train under a 1992
law, was expected to become a model.
</P>
<P>
   The train, scheduled to begin service between Miami and Orlando
in 2004 and to Tampa by 2006, would have whisked passengers at up
to 200 miles per hour, like similar bullet trains found in Japan
and Europe. In 1996, when the state signed the deal with Florida
Overland Express, state officials said they expected the train to
ease congestion on highways and runways as the state faced enormous
traffic growth.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents said the project was too heavily subsidized by the
state and doubted it would ever attract enough demand to avoid
losing money. The state had earmarked $70 million of its $3 billion
budget for high-speed rail capital costs each year for the next 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Fluor Corp.'s engineering and construction
subsidiary, the project's consortium included GEC Alsthom, the
French-British company that developed the technology for France's
TGV (train a grande vitesse), which would have been used for
Florida's trains. GEC Alsthom is a joint venture between General
Electric Co. PLC of Britain and Alcatel Alsthom SA of France.
</P>
<P>
   David Gedney, chief executive officer of Florida Overland
Express, known as FOX, said: ``We are disappointed. The
contributions of many peole, working to make FOX viable and help
solve Florida's transportation challenges, are being negated.''

BRAZIL WORRY TRIMS US INVESTMENT ENTHUSIASM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anxiety over economic instability in Brazil increased Thursday,
causing the US stock market to tumble amid worries about profits of
US companies reliant on exports to a growing list of countries in
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The US market, which zoomed to new highs after sustaining global
shocks from Japan, southeast Asia, and Russia, was slammed for a
second straight day. Investors continued to be concerned about the
impact in this country of Wednesday's currency devaluation by
Brazil, the world's eighth-largest economy, and a 10 percent plunge
in its stock market. Investors continued to withdraw funds at the
daily rate of about $1 billion Thursday, further draining foreign
currency reserves that were replenished last year by an
international aid package.
</P>
<P>
   The gains made this year by the Dow Jones industrial average
were wiped out by four consecutive days of declines. Thursday, the
Dow dropped by 2.45 percent, losing 228.l63 points and closing at
9120.93. For the year, the Dow is off nearly 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said that though they do not expect Brazil's currency
flight to reach the crisis level of Asia's ``contagion,'' it could
continue to shake global markets in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have absolute nervousness about the international
economy,'' said Dan Eagan, a Philadelphia money manager. ``I'm not
predicting a financial meltdown, but when you have expensive US
stocks and negative news, you get a pullback.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlining the impact of the world's woes on US companies,
Eastman Kodak reported that Russia's collapse, contraction in Asia,
and a slowdown in Latin America contributed to weaker profits in
the fourth quarter and a sharper-than-expected, 5.7 percent decline
in revenue, to $3.56 billion, compared with a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   All major US stock markets fell. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
declined 22.21 points, or 1.8 percent, closing at 1212.19. And the
technology-dominated Nasdaq fell 39.99 points, or 1.73 percent,
closing at 2276.82.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation the impeachment trial of President Clinton
added to unease in US markets. But a rally in US Treasury bonds
indicated that investors still view this country as a safe harbor
for their money. The price of 30-year bonds rose 1 3/32, or $10.94
per $1,000 bond, the biggest three-day advance in more than three
months. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price,
dropped to 5.05 percent, from 5.13 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's unease Thursday was focused on Brazil, the United
States' largest trading partner in Latin America. The United States
exported about $16 billion in goods to Brazil last year, or 2.3
percent of total exports; Latin America consumes just under 20
percent of US exports.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil was forced Wednesday to devalue its currency, the real,
by 8 percent amid a widening panic that the country would not be
able to arrest its growing trade account and budget deficit, which
is 7.5 percent of gross domestic product. The problem has been
aggravated by extremely high interest rates on borrowings to
finance the deficits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is worried about (devaluation) something on the
order of 25 to 50 percent,'' said Victor Thompson, head of global
fixed income at State Street Global Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   But economists said there was little that world leaders and
central bankers could do to help Brazil, which was granted a $41.5
billion aid package in November assembled by the International
Monetary Fund, the United States, and other lenders. In return,
Brazil agreed to trim $23 million from its deficit in 1999 and take
other steps; it has met only part of those commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world's options are very limited and, to a certain extent,
the options in Brazil are very limited,'' said Santiago Millan,
economist on Brazil for the New York currency consultant
Independent Economic Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   What concerns economists is that if the real does not stabilize,
Brazil may be forced to abandon its fixed currency system and allow
it to plunge. That in turn could spark currency crises in other
Latin America countries.
</P>
<P>
   A central bank official said it had no intention of floating the
currency, which was little changed at 1.318 reals to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian leaders are grappling with how to get their financial
house in order through difficult fiscal measures that would stem
the flight of investors but are politically controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the US-IMF aid package was in the form of a line of
credit upon which Brazil could draw whenever necessary to defend
its currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no line of credit that is big enough if everybody
decides if they want to go at once,'' said Catherine Mann, senior
fellow and Latin America specialist for the Institute for
International Economics in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Mann believes that Brazilian president Fernando Henrique
Cardoso is taking steps that may calm capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   In a special session Wednesday, Brazil's Senate approved a
presidential decree raising corporate income taxes, a measure
expected to yield $3.8 billion this year. It also approved a
measure reducing long-term interest rates to 12 percent a year from
19 percent. Other, more difficult proposals, are scheduled for a
vote next week.
</P>
<P>
   Mann said the controversial currency devaluation would help the
economy by reducing the price of Brazil's goods on world markets.
Devaluation also forced to the surface political disputes between
Cardoso and autonomous state governments that ultimately cause the
states to blink _ or take the blame.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Governor Itamar Franco of Minas Gerais, Brazil's
third-wealthiest state, declared a 90-day moratorium on debt
payments to the federal government. Other governors threatened to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The devaluation was ``a big gamble, because if the gamble works
Minas Gerais concedes and one piece of the fiscal puzzle is
solved,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you lose, the country is back into a situation with a
falling exchange rate, inflation pressures, a collapsed stock
market, econ disaster _ with no change to the underlying problem.
''

GOVERNMENT LAUNCHES BROAD ATTACK ON MICROSOFT'S LEAD-OFF WITNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Justice Department lawyer produced several
prominent academic papers on Thursday that he said showed that the
Microsoft Corp.'s first witness in its antitrust trial had written
opinions contradicting views he has offered in expert testimony for
the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   In a broad attack on the witness, Richard L. Schmalensee, an
economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, David
Boies, the government's lead trial lawyer, produced evidence that a
survey cited by Schmalensee in his testimony actually appeared to
be a publicity tool thought up by Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   In Schmalensee's direct testimony, he wrote that in a recent
survey of software developers, ``85 percent predicted that
Microsoft's integration of Internet functions into Windows would
help their company, and 83 percent predicted it would help
consumers.'' He cited the figures to support his own advocacy of
those positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever look at that survey, find out what its purpose
was?'' Boies asked. When Schmalensee said he had not, Boies asked,
``Did anyone ever tell you that the purpose was to give Gates
helpful information to use at a Senate hearing'' early last year?
</P>
<P>
   Then Boies produced an e-mail message in which Gates wrote last
February, ``It would HELP ME IMMENSELY to have a survey showing
that 90 percent of developers believe that putting the browser into
the operating system makes sense,'' adding, ``Ideally we would have
a survey before I appear at the Senate on March 3rd.''
</P>
<P>
   In a subsequent string of e-mail messages, Microsoft employees
laid out how they would pose the questions to get the responses
Gates wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee said that had he known the origin of the polling
information, he would have cited the figures in his testimony
anyway, though he might have added ``an explanatory phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   Through most of the day, Boies worked to tear down Schmalensee's
central argument: that Microsoft does not hold significant
marketing power and in fact faces real competition in the market
for personal computer operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday and Thursday, Schmalensee argued at length that
Linux, a free Unix-based operating system, posed a significant
near-term threat to Windows, the Microsoft operating system that is
shipped on more than on 90 percent of all new computers. He said he
came to this conclusion largely from reading newspaper and magazine
articles, particularly the computer trade press.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Boies introduced into evidence an article from PC
Week On Line last June in which Gates, in an interview, said that
Linux posed no threat to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a customer mention Linux to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee said Gates' statement ``is at least interpretable as
a marketing statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee testified that the small competitors nipping at
Microsoft's operating system business should be considered serious
threats. And he said that their existence showed that the barriers
to entry into the operating system market were not high, so
Microsoft should not be viewed as a monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   But in an article in the Antitrust Law Journal in 1997,
Schmalensee wrote: ``A clear signal of low barriers to entry is
provided only by effective, viable entry'' into the market ``that
takes a nontrivial market share. There is a substantial difference
between toehold entry and substantial entry that provides real
pressure on established firms' profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee acknowledged under questioning that no competitor to
Microsoft had ever met that test. Still, he argued, Microsoft had
behaved and spent research and development money as if it did face
competitive threats, particularly from the International Business
Machines Corp., which introduced the unsuccessful OS/2 operating
system almost 10 years ago. That, he suggested, put pressure on
Microsoft's profits, meeting one of his tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discussed this with Gates,'' he said. ``He told me about the
time when cooperation between Microsoft and IBM ended; IBM said
effectively: `We will bury you.' He took that threat very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee said that Microsoft had spent money on research to
counter that threat. But when pressed, he acknowledged that he
really had no direct knowledge of that and was only presuming it to
be the case.

 WHAT'S AT THE MOVIES  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend.
Rating and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   Now Playing
</P>
<P>
   `AFFLICTION,' starring Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Willem Dafoe,
Sissy Spacek and Mary Beth Hurt. Directed by Paul Schrader (R, 114
minutes). Nolte is devastating in the performance of his career, as
Wade Whitehouse, a New Hampshire loner fighting a losing battle
with demons from his past. Foremost among them: Coburn,
terrifyingly authentic as the drunken, abusive father who long ago
cowed his sons into submission. As directed by Schrader, this pure,
unfettered adaptation of Russell Banks' novel starts on a
deceptively ordinary note, then escalates into inexorable fury.
Every little detail matters. Spacek and Hurt expertly play the
women who trigger Wade's crisis. _ Janet Maslin &QR;
</P>
<P>
   `CENTRAL STATION,' &UR;  &LR; starring Fernanda Montenegro, Vinicius de
Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115
minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older
woman crosses paths with an orphaned young boy. There's plenty of
room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Salles' film is all
in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then
embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's
hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Salles brings great
tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey.
Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of last year's very
best. Maslin
</P>
<P>
   `A CIVIL ACTION,' &UR;  &LR; starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall.
Directed by Steven Zaillian (PG-13, 120 minutes). This story of a
David-Goliath lawsuit against industrial polluters, with Travolta
first rate as an ambulance chaser who develops a conscience, could
have been business as usual in the legal thriller genre. But
Zaillian's keenly observed, beautifully-acted film, based on
Jonathan Harr's nonfiction best seller about a case in Woburn,
Mass., doesn't follow familiar formulas. It follows all the
surprises and frustrations of a story that was never black and
white, and is all the better for its shades of gray. Duvall is
outstanding as a corporate lawyer full of wily tricks. Maslin &QR;
</P>
<P>
   `THE GENERAL,' &UR;  &LR; starring Brendan Gleeson and Jon Voight.
Directed by John Boorman (not rated, 125 minutes). Boorman's best
and most stylish film in years is the deftly told story of Martin
Cahill. Nicknamed ``the General'' for his crime-plotting
strategies, this Irish gang leader and master thief is played with
splendid brio by Gleeson. Photographed gorgeously in black and
white, the film tells of his elaborate art and jewel heists, his
unusual domestic arrangement with his wife's sister and his
singular difficulties with the IRA and the law. Voight is
outstandingly good as the police detective who knows all of
Cahill's tricks. Maslin &QR;
</P>
<P>
   `GODS AND MONSTERS,' &UR;  &LR; starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.
Directed by Bill Condon (not rated, 105 minutes). In a performance
that well deserves to be remembered at Academy Award time, McKellen
becomes the deliciously urbane James Whale, depicting the gay
``Frankenstein'' director late in life. Shaken by the aftereffects
of a mild stroke, this Whale finds his past coming back to greet
him just as the present offers new fascination in the Adonis-like
form of the gardener ( Fraser, also fine), whom Whale finds mowing
his lawn. This beautifully acted, witty and heart-tugging film,
from a Christopher Bram book, imagines what Whale's final days
might have been like while shaping a splendid character study and a
droll portrait of closeted gay Hollywood. Lynn Redgrave provides
ballast and comic relief as Whale's perpetually scandalized
housekeeper. Maslin
</P>
<P>
   `HILARY AND JACKIE,' &UR;  &LR; starring Emily Watson and Rachel
Griffiths. Directed by Anand Tucker (R, 121 minutes). The parallel
biographies of the brilliant cellist Jacqueline du Pre (Watson),
who contracted multiple sclerosis at the height of her career, and
her slightly older sister, Jackie (Griffiths), a talented flutist
who gave up a professional career to marry and be ``ordinary,'' is
one of the most insightful studies of sibling rivalry ever filmed.
Jacqueline may have won fame and glory, the movie says, but she
remained a desperately needy emotional child who had to have
everything Hilary had (including Hilary's husband). The film is
structured like a concerto, in three movements, the last of which
ends with Jackie's harrowing death in her sister's arms. The drama
is deepened by a soundtrack that makes expert use of Jacqueline's
signature piece, the Elgar Cello Concerto in E minor. Watson's
Jacqueline flames with an almost scary intensity. Stephen Holden
</P>
<P>
   `THE HI-LO COUNTRY,' &UR;  &LR; starring Billy Crudup, Woody Harrelson,
Sam Elliott and Patricia Arquette. Directed by Stephen Frears (R,
114 minutes). Frears, the British director, makes a bold but
unsteady leap into classic western territory with this story of a
friendship between two cowboys who go into the cattle business
together after returning from World War II. Crudup is the shy,
laconic Pete, who secretly covets the married girlfriend of his
idol, Big Boy (Harrelson). A movie that wants to be a hybrid of
``Giant,'' ``Red River'' and ``The Last Picture Show'' loses its
bearings and becomes a laborious soap opera whose red-headed bad
girl (Arquette) lacks the magnetism to make the drama sizzle. But
Harrelson is a live wire as the rootin'-tootin' last of a breed.

HOUSE PROSECUTORS PRESS FOR WITNESSES AT SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House prosecutors urged the Senate on Thursday to
remove President Clinton from office for ``serial lying'' about his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and
obstructing the quest for the truth in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment suit.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, opening a three-day presentation of their
case against Clinton, pressed the Senate to summon witnesses before
deciding the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' witness list included Lewinsky, Clinton
confidante Vernon Jordan, presidential personal secretary Betty
Currie and former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James F. Rogan, R-Calif., a former municipal court judge
and deputy district attorney in Los Angeles County, urged the
Senate to permit witnesses, saying ``the evidence will show the
president charted a course of perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., a 20-year House veteran,
said House prosecutors remain convinced that ``witnesses are
essential'' to give the Senate's final judgment of Clinton
``heightened credence.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., a former U.S. attorney in the
Reagan years, urged senators to at least summon Jordan to assess
whether the Washington superlawyer was part of an effort to buy
Lewinsky's silence by arranging a job for her in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now if we had Mr. Jordan on the witness stand, you could probe
where his loyalties lie, listen to the tone of his voice, look into
his eyes and determine the truthfulness of his statements,''
Hutchinson declared. ``You could decide whether he is telling the
truth or withholding information.''
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., had
earlier urged the Senate to summon Clinton to testify _ a proposal
rejected by the White House. Senate GOP leaders voiced interest in
the proposal late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors' appeal for witnesses appeared to gain
support among some Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, saying prosecutors' request for
witnesses had ``changed'' his mind, said he wants to hear from
Lewinsky and Currie because he sees conflicts in their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would vote for having the witnesses on the issue of
obstruction of justice,'' said Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens echoed Hyde's call for Clinton to testify as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president wants to clear himself with history, he
should testify,'' Stevens said. ``History will not be good to this
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, the Senate unanimously struck a bipartisan deal to
defer the question of witnesses until later in the trial.
Republican House prosecutors have urged the Senate to hear
witnesses. The White House and Democratic House members have
resisted such a plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of three days of arguments by the prosecution,
House members sketched a pattern of obstruction and obfuscation by
the president in a six-hour presentation before 100 seated silent
senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here today because President William Jefferson Clinton
decided to put himself above the law _ not once, not twice but
repeatedly,'' declared Sensenbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   He provided some of the most florid rhetoric of the day,
likening the actions of the president to a ``cancer'' that has to
be removed for the nation to survive
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it is important, yes vital, that when a cancer
exists in the body politic, our job _ our duty _ is to excise it,''
Sensenbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors offered videotaped replays of Clinton taking the
oath of office at his inauguration on Jan. 20, 1993; his Aug. 17,
1998 testimony before a grand jury convened by special prosecutor
Kenneth Starr; and his videotaped deposition in Paula Jones' sexual
harassment suit taken in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Senators paid attention, took notes, exchanged glances, nodded
off and even passed candy among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., slipped a piece of candy at one
point to neighboring Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii. Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., wore sunglasses one day after eye surgery. Sen.
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, appeared to nod off at one point,
catching himself with a jolt and sitting upright seemingly
embarrassed; he took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist in flowing black judicial robes
presided from a high-backed chair.
</P>
<P>
   Many senators withheld substantive comment after the session.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., emerged to tell reporters that he was
``not going to make any comment during the trial.'' Sen. John
Warner, R-Va., said, ``I'd just assume not make any comment.'' Sen.
James H. Inhofe, R-Okla., said: ``It's too early.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats complained about repetition in the House
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept feeling like I heard everything again and again,'' said
Sen. John Breaux, D-La.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, calling the House prosecutors' effort
``forceful and very well presented'' but added: ``I got nothing new
from the presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D.N.D., found ``nothing new here,'' adding:
``For those of us who have read everything, there's nothing new.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Senate Democrats complained that Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., had breached the bipartisan deal to defer a
decision about witnesses when he permitted Republican senators to
meet with Republican House prosecutors earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's created quite a bit of indignation in many of us,'' said
Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said Democrats now believe that
bipartisanship has been ``broken apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., one of the GOP senators involved in
the private meeting with House prosecutors, said the meeting was
held to alert House prosecutors that they can't assume that they
would automatically get witnesses for their case for Clinton's
removal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stipulated last week to 7,000 pages of testimony and
investigative reports compiled over the past year in an effort to
limit the Senate impeachment trial to existing testimony rather
than opening the door to fresh evidence.

   Members of the public who stood in line to gain admission to the
historic session said they found the presentations repetitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already have my opinion,'' said Linda Tibetts-Barto, 46, of
International Falls, Minn. ``It's real boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State University student Chris Wyatt, 22, of East
Lansing, Mich., said the proceedings ``seemed kind of long and
drawn out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Russell, 17, a high school student from Zion, Ill., said
the Senate was ``doing the right thing to bring (Clinton) up on the
charges,'' adding that the Senate proceedings proved
``interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Abagyle Holverson, 17, also a high school student from Zion,
Ill., said: ``I thought it was pretty much the same thing
everybody's been hearing,'' adding: ``I think he should stay in
office because people voted for him knowing he was not the

   `HURLYBURLY,' &UR;  &LR; starring Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright
Penn, Chazz Palminteri, Garry Shandling, Anna Paquin and Meg Ryan.
Directed by Anthony Drazan (R, 122 minutes). David Rabe's screen
adaptation of his 80s play about macho mind games in a
cocaine-infested Hollywood is a nasty but powerful piece of work
made all the more disturbing by the film's close-up view of its
troubled characters. Penn as Eddie, a Hollywood casting director on
the skids, eviscerates himself in a stunning performance full of
tears, snarls and dripping nostrils. Spacey, as Eddie's slick,
ruthless housemate, Mickey, is appropriately reptilian, and
Palminteri and Shandling are creepily convincing as two of their
friends. Penn, Paquin and Ryan are the women they abuse and pass
around like trading cards. The movie, like the play, isn't so much
about sex as it is about the male incapacity for genuinely selfless
friendship.Holden
</P>
<P>
   `PATCH ADAMS,' &UR;  &LR; starring Robin Williams and Monica Potter.
Directed by Tom Shadyac (PG-13, 110 minutes). As a maverick doctor
intent on making terminal patients laugh, Williams delivers a
little clowning and a lot of maudlin feel-good sentiment, along
with vulgarity left over from the filmmaker's ``Ace Ventura'' days.
He also spends a lot of time being congratulated for his good
works, as the film's minor players are kept busy marveling at his
antics. The real-life story of this doctor may sound like a fine
excuse for Williams to cut loose, but the film version proves
narrow and predictable. Potter, with a nostrilly resemblance to
Julia Roberts, figures in a romantic subplot with a bizarre twist.

</P>
<P>
   `THE PRINCE OF EGYPT,' &UR;  &LR; starring the voices of Val Kilmer, Ralph
Fiennes and Michelle Pfeiffer. Directed by Brenda Chapman, Steve
Hickner and Simon Wells (PG, 93 minutes). First came the great
expectations for this animated magnum opus from Dreamworks. Then
came reality, in a film struggling mightily to balance animated
whimsy and biblical stature. The upshot is an admirably worthy
rendering of the Exodus story, even if Moses must initially be seen
as a playful young scamp. Biblical plagues and miracles serve as
special inspiration for the animators' reality-bending ingenuity.
Maslin
</P>
<P>
   `PRIVATE CONFESSIONS,' starring Pernilla August and Max Von
Sydow. Written by Ingmar Bergman. Directed by Liv Ullmann (not
rated, 127 minutes). The pedigree is irresistible, the screenplay
often wrenchingly astute, as Bergman delves with wisdom into a
spiritual and marital crisis experienced by his mother. In a film
directed by Ullmann with Bergmanesque watchfulness, and with enough
assurance to recall his devastating ``Scenes From a Marriage,'' an
adulterous liaison becomes a defining event in the life of a
lonely, restless woman. Set mostly in 1925, the film also visits
her past and her future, and features a formidable performance from
Von Sydow and August passionately extending upon her ``Best
Intentions'' role. Maslin
</P>
<P>
   `SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE,' &UR;  &LR; starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth
Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench. Directed by
John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate
delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets
better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc
Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp
dialogue reminiscent of his ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are
Dead,'' dares to imagine whatever it likes about the link between
Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad yearning for a certain
aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile this tirelessly inventive comedy
also envisions an Elizabethan theater fraught with the same
backbiting and conniving we enjoy today, and has great fun
presenting the creation of ``Romeo and Juliet,'' glitches and all.
Fiennes and Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the
first great, fully realized starring performance of her
career.Maslin
</P>
<P>
   `A SIMPLE PLAN,' &UR;  &LR; starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and
Bridget Fonda. Directed by Sam Raimi (R, 120 minutes). This onetime
cult horror director makes a flawless transition to mainstream
storytelling with a quietly devastating thriller. And its fine cast
plays out the consequences of a harmless-sounding error in judgment
that winds up leveling everything in its path. The catalyst is $4.4
million that literally falls out of the sky, and Scott Smith's
story proves how deadly the morality of expediency can become. When
you get the shivers watching this wintry tale, which features an
especially memorable performance from Thornton, it won't be from
the cold. Maslin
</P>
<P>
   `THE THIN RED LINE,' &UR;  &LR; starring Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, Nick
Nolte and Sean Penn and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Terrence
Malick (R, 166 minutes). From the first frame of this huge,
drifting war epic loosely derived from James Jones' Guadalcanal
novel, it's viscerally clear that Malick is back. The exquisite,
oddly detached visual style that made ``Badlands'' and ``Days of
Heaven'' the most beautiful films of the 1970s is instantly
apparent here, even if the narrative vagueness and brooding
voice-overs are also familiar. The film sprawls, gets lost and
occasionally delivers visual poetry, the kind that could have been
greatly helped by tighter editing. Bottom line: no one who admired
Malick's early work should miss this. But those expecting anything
simple will not find it here. Maslin.
</P>
<P>
   `YOU'VE GOT MAIL,' &UR;  &LR; starring Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Greg Kinnear
and Parker Posey. Directed by Nora Ephron (PG, 110 minutes). This
cozy, inviting comedy romanticizes the rivalry between two
bookstore owners, while also finding time to fall in love with
books themselves, the instant intimacy of e-mail and a
picture-perfect rendering of Manhattan's Upper West Side. With a
feel-good ambiance much less forced than that of ``Sleepless in
Seattle,'' Ephron borrows adroitly from ``The Shop Around the
Corner'' while making this knowing, urbanely funny film very much
her own. Ryan is fresh and adorable without trying, while a
ruefully lovelorn Hanks proves that he can do anything. Again.

   EIGHTH ANNUAL NEW YORK JEWISH FILM FESTIVAL. Four classic silent
films from the Soviet Union highlight the New York Jewish Film
Festival, which opens on Sunday at the Walter Reade Theater at
Lincoln Center. The festival, a collaboration between the Film
Society of Lincoln Center and the Jewish Museum, features three
world, seven United States and four New York premieres among its 25
productions. Illuminating the Jewish experience, these films are

films from the Soviet Union is a 40-minute fragment from ``Against
the Fathers' Will'' (1927), a Soviet adaptation of Sholem
Aleichem's ``In the Storm,'' a novel of the 1905 Revolution. The
festival's opening attraction at 4 p.m. on Sunday is ``The
Harmonists'' (1997), the German filmmaker Joseph Vilsmaier's
fact-based drama about a popular vocal group of the 1920s and 30s
who fell victim to Nazi racial politics. Also in the series is
``Left Luggage,'' a film with Isabella Rossellini about a young
Jewish student in 1970s Antwerp. The New York Jewish Film Festival
continues through Jan. 27. Admission: $8.50; $5 for Film Society of
Lincoln Center members; $4.50 for the elderly at weekday matinees.

 &HT;    If best day rated `boring,', that doesn't bode well for rest of
TV trial coverage
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Asked about the opening strategy of those making the
case against Bill Clinton, former senate Whitewater counsel Robert
Giuffra told CNN before Thursday's televised impeachment trial,
``It's got to be interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. Less than two hours into the trial, the consensus
among TV's talking heads was that both senators and viewers were
nodding off. Fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boring,'' ABC analyst Bill Kristol offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Admirably boring,'' David Brooks, of the Weekly Standard,
added later on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can feel physically the numbness (of having) to be there,''
former Louisiana Sen. J. Bennett Johnston told ABC's Peter Jennings
when asked what it might be like to be seated in the Senate. ``You
can't go out in the hall, get on the phone ... Someone joked
earlier, `Are we in the penalty phase yet?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The historic day did not play very historically on TV. It was to
be ``a momentous day'' (CBS's Dan Rather), with a ``great deal in
the balance, most notably the president's future'' (ABC's
Jennings), a day in which we've ``finally reached the moment of
truth'' (Fox's Jim Angle).
</P>
<P>
   It all began with a lawyerly thud. Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois,
the man leading the charge against Clinton, was the very definition
of decorum with his white hair and the ample cut of his dark suit.
But he sounded strangely over-prepared _ flat and unemotional. He
seemed so caught up in acknowledging history _ he went on about
Thomas Moore for ages _ he missed his own historic moment. Giving a
rundown of who would speak about what for the next three days, Hyde
came across like a professor reviewing for his class the new
semester's syllabus.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) followed, trying to do Hyde
one better: He quoted or referenced, among others, Theodore
Roosevelt, James Madison, the framers of British law and the U.S.
civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   All the networks stayed with Sensenbrenner as he droned on in
his vowel-pulling Midwestern accent. They couldn't find a polite
way to exit. So it wasn't long after he finished that CBS and ABC
vamoosed, about 2:30 p.m., and moved onto soap operas. WXIA stuck
with NBC's impeachment coverage (provided by its cable partner
MSNBC) a half hour longer, but only because the network fed its
affiliates a pre-holiday repeat of ``Leeza'' (``They were talking
about Christmas trees or somethning,'' said WXIA general manager
Bob Walker) instead of the last half hour of ``Another World.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial did find its courtroom legs late in the day, beginning
with Rep. Asa Hutchinson. He didn't set off fireworks, but his
eager, if methodical unreeling of facts finally got to the reason
the president is in this pickle, instead of satisfying itself with
historical grandstanding. Hutchinson was followed by Rep. James
Rogan, who testified until the trial broke at 7 p.m. with what
looked like a cool, bad taste in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Did he make a strong case? asked CNN's Judy Woodruff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depends on what your definition of `strong' is,'' half-joked
Jeff Greenfield.
</P>
<P>
   But for many observers, the historic day lacked a certain ...
historic-ness.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how history would judge Thursday, historian Doris Kearns
Goodwin told NBC's Tom Brokaw, ``It just doesn't feel like I
imagined it would. I want to feel enlarged as I watch this. But
even though I know this is history, I feel small, diminished and
sad. It doesn't leave me, as an historian, excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Added presidential historian Michael Beschloss, on PBS, ``I
don't think I can remember a word that was spoken today.''
</P>
<P>
   Not good news for viewers today and Saturday: Thursday was
supposed to be the prosecutors' most interesting day.

seemed so caught up in acknowledging history _ he went on about

semester's syllabus.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) followed, trying to do Hyde
one better: He quoted or referenced, among others, Theodore
Roosevelt, James Madison, the framers of British law and the U.S.
civil rights movement.

<P>
   All the networks stayed with Sensenbrenner as he droned on in
his vowel-pulling Midwestern accent. They couldn't find a polite
way to exit. So it wasn't long after he finished that CBS and ABC
vamoosed, about 2:30 p.m., and moved onto soap operas. WXIA stuck
with NBC's impeachment coverage (provided by its cable partner
MSNBC) a half hour longer, but only because the network fed its
affiliates a pre-holiday repeat of ``Leeza'' (``They were talking
about Christmas trees or somethning,'' said WXIA general manager
Bob Walker) instead of the last half hour of ``Another World.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial did find its courtroom legs late in the day, beginning
with Rep. Asa Hutchinson. He didn't set off fireworks, but his
eager, if methodical unreeling of facts finally got to the reason
the president is in this pickle, instead of satisfying itself with
historical grandstanding. Hutchinson was followed by Rep. James
Rogan, who testified until the trial broke at 7 p.m. with what
looked like a cool, bad taste in his mouth.

   Did he make a strong case? asked CNN's Judy Woodruff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depends on what your definition of `strong' is,'' half-joked

<P>

sad. It doesn't leave me, as an historian, excited.''

   ATLANTA _ Asked about the opening strategy of those making the
case against Bill Clinton, former senate Whitewater counsel Robert
Giuffra told CNN before Thursday's televised impeachment trial,
``It's got to be interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. Less than two hours into the trial, the consensus
among TV's talking heads was that both senators and viewers were
nodding off. Fast.

 SPILLING THE BEANS ON A PASSION  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 17)
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CLARENCE CENTER, N.Y. _ As they sipped Turkish saffron tea in
the new coffee shop run by their entrepreneur daughter, David and
Beverly Falzone seemed downright relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We locked her out of the house when she was 14,'' Falzone
said. ``It was the hardest thing we ever did.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyleena Falzone, the erstwhile prodigal daughter, is now 27. ``I
was a poster child for bad,'' she agreed. ``Even the nuns at the
Sacred Heart Academy threw me out.'' Her main offense was truancy,
she said, adding that, after being kicked out of home, she spent a
few nights sleeping in a bowling alley.
</P>
<P>
   And though she soon got back on track in school _ and with Mom
and Dad _ Ms. Falzone's taste for adventurous living was not as
easily adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   While working towards a bachelor's degree in communications at
the University of Buffalo, she spent summer and winter vacations
working as a waitress in the Hamptons on Long Island and in
Colorado's ski country. Jobs were plentiful and her customers _
including, she said, Peter Jennings, Billy Joel and Barbra
Streisand _ were good tippers. ``I learned a lot about the
restaurant business and dealing with customers,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   At 23, Ms. Falzone decided that she was ready to go into
business for herself. Coffee was the obvious choice. ``Other kids
had lemonade stands while I had an iced-coffee stand,'' she said.
She also just loves coffee, calling it a ``liquid seduction;'' she
may drink three cups an hour during a workday.
</P>
<P>
   First, she decided to do a little research: Strapping on a
backpack, and with just $2,000 in her pocket, she took off on a
yearlong, globe-circling trip to check out the coffee scene. Alone.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to paint a more persuasive illustration of
the fundamental rule for beginning entrepreneurs: Do your homework.
``I visited 44 countries and filled 25 notebooks,'' Ms. Falzone
explained as she pointed to her journals, now on display in her
shop along with hundreds of other java-related artifacts she
collected, from coffee makers to coffee-bean necklaces.
</P>
<P>
   During her travels, she quickly picked up a survival skill that
is important for any entrepreneur: improvisation. ``I waitressed at
a cafe in Thailand, cooked in Bali and cleaned hospitals in
Australia,'' she said. Off-hours were often spent doing research at
coffee plantations and coffee-roasting plants.
</P>
<P>
   Among the nuggets of wisdom she picked up: Costa Rica, Guatemala
and Java, the Indonesian island, grow the best coffee beans, and
you can't separate business from ethics. ``I won't buy Guatemalan
because they have little girls working full-time in the fields,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Falzone also did research on tea, mostly in Thailand and
India.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to the United States, she set to work. She
clicked on to the small-business Web site of American Express, to
look for areas of the country with little or no competition in
gourmet coffee shops, ultimately choosing this upstate New York
burg (population 1,376) just east of Buffalo and her hometown of
Williamsville.
</P>
<P>
   Next, in putting together a business plan, she landed free help
from the Service Corps of Retired Executives and received a $46,000
loan from the Small Business Administration, which she added to a
$10,000 credit line extended by the Bank of Dad.
</P>
<P>
   With cash in hand, the caffeine capitalist secured a lease on a
170-year-old former post office in the heart of town and christened
it the Clarence Center Coffee Co. She picked up furnishings at
auctions and antique shops, calling on friends to help her scrape,
sand and paint.
</P>
<P>
   In the week after the grand opening last August, Ms. Falzone
said, more than 4,000 customers trooped in, so she expanded her
staff to 10, from 2.
</P>
<P>
   After just six months, the venture is turning a profit, the SBA
loan is being repaid and Ms. Falzone is drawing a modest salary.
``My accountant is completely astounded,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She attributed her success to several factors besides her
knowledge of the industry and a flair for keeping down costs. She
cited her shop's intimate atmosphere (African music and lots of
lighted candles) and a management style that lets employees make
their own judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a customer asks if they can have a discount, since they
bought 20 cups, then the counter person should make that
decision,'' she said. ``I gave someone sole custodianship over the
bakery case and it looks beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   To build good will locally, Ms. Falzone buys all her supplies
and various menu items from area businesses. And, mining her past,
she lectures area teen-agers about the importance of staying in
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a teen-ager, you live for today,'' she said. ``I
tell them that there is going to be much more to their lives, and
they have to prepare for that by staying in school.''
</P>
<P>
   Those issues aside, what does she think is the Cadillac of
coffees, the best of the best? She answers without hesitation _
Buon Me Thout, a sweet Vietnamese brew made with condensed milk.
``Vietnam has only been exporting coffee since 1993, and they don't
use pesticides yet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But ``best'' is a subjective term, she added. ``Last week, I
brewed up some strong Brazilian Santos coffee in a French press and
it knocked people's socks off,'' she said. ``But I don't know if
Clarence is ready for it yet.''

OREGON SENATORS PUT PARTISAN RANCOR ASIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ It is hardly unusual to find Sen. Ron Wyden
conducting town hall-style meetings in Oregon, nor is it unusual to
find the state's other senator, Gordon Smith, doing the same thing.
But in these days of partisan rancor in Washington, it is unusual
to find the two men, who faced off in a bitter election just three
years ago, at the same meetings all across the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, our colleagues look at Senator Wyden and myself and
they scratch their heads and they wonder, what is in the water out
there that they're drinking?'' Smith said the other day at the
start of a joint meeting at a senior citizens' center in Portland,
as Wyden smiled alongside him. ``Well, we hope it's contagious.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a conservative Mormon Republican from rural eastern
Oregon and Wyden, a liberal Jewish Democrat from Portland, are
touring the state with their political odd-couple routine, which
both men jokingly refer to as ``penance'' for the nasty campaign
they conducted against each other. But in fact, they say, the
meetings are aimed at forming a ``bipartisan agenda for Oregon'' of
issues on which they can work together.
</P>
<P>
   They describe themselves as the first pair of senators from
opposite parties to hold such meetings in every congressional
district in their state. While that assertion cannot be verified by
Senate historians, their bonhomie is certainly a contrast to the
inter-party feuding that has marked much of the debate over the sex
scandal involving President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here today as a Republican and a Democrat, but first
we're here as American senators to say there's a way to disagree
without being disagreeable,'' Smith, 46, told the Portland
audience. ``There's a way to debate without debasing.''
</P>
<P>
   The meetings, so far held here and in Eugene, have less the
flavor of the Lincoln-Douglas debates than of a wedding reception
at which two beaming fathers trade kind words about each other.
Smith calls Wyden ``my good friend,'' and Wyden, 49, occasionally
describes his colleague as ``this tall pea picker,'' a reference to
the frozen-vegetable business run by Smith's family.
</P>
<P>
   For both men, the courtesy is almost certainly smart politics.
In states where politics is more of a contact sport, voters might
chafe at the goodwill. But in Oregon, niceness seems to be a
political asset, bipartisanship a mantra. ``Session starts with
civil pledges,'' ran the lead headline in The Oregonian the other
day over an article about the opening of the 70th state legislative
session in Salem.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995 and early 1996, after Sen. Bob Packwood resigned in
the midst of a sex scandal, Wyden, then a congressman, and Smith,
then a state senator, faced off in a special election to fill the
seat Packwood held for 27 years. It was dominated by nasty
commercials. Smith's food business was presented by his opponent as
a greedy environmental polluter. Wyden was described as a
hopelessly out-of-touch liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden won, but just months later, Oregon's other senator, Mark
O. Hatfield, announced he was retiring after five terms. Smith won
the general election with a more moderate campaign than the one he
conducted against Wyden and soon the state, which had the clout of
two senators with nearly 60 years of seniority between them, was
represented by two rookies.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve both some influence for their state and an aura of
statesmanship for themselves, it made sense to get along. The two
got together for breakfast and discovered they had much in common _
school-age children, a sense of humor, a desire to get things done.
</P>
<P>
   They even had briefly attended the same elementary school in
suburban Maryland in the late 1950s, when Smith's father was an
Agriculture Department aide and Wyden's father was a newspaper
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   They also shared a common revulsion at the campaign they had run
against each other. ``Both of us by the end of it said we can
hardly recognize ourselves with all the muck and charges and
countercharges and the like,'' Wyden said at the meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so we said, on our watch, Oregon is not going to have a
food fight in the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   They certainly have different views on many things, including
abortion and some environmental issues, although, as Smith jokes:
``You know what's good about that? When we cancel each other out,
everybody in Oregon feels represented.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is plenty to agree on, most of all any measures
designed to bring money back home. The senators have issued several
joint news releases, in which they have agreed to support
transportation measures, a bill that would change Medicare
reimbursement formulas in a way that would benefit Oregon, and
deepening of the Columbia River Channel to 43 feet so Oregon can
maintain a ``world-class port facility.''
</P>
<P>
   They also jointly introduced a Senate bill last year, in the
wake of fatal shootings by a Springfield, Ore., high school
student, that would require students who bring guns to school to be
held for 72 hours and to undergo a psychological evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   And they clearly cooperate in other ways. At the Portland
meeting, aides to the two men traded notes over the quickest way to
get back to Washington for the Senate session. Wyden's aides had
their man on a Delta flight through Salt Lake City that arrived 90
minutes earlier than the United flight Smith was booked on; soon
Smith was reserved on the same flight as his colleague.
</P>
<P>
   At the meetings here and in Eugene, the senators seemed to
disagree on little. The only specific bill they recalled voting
differently on was a measure involving labor negotiating standards.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were circumspect about the impeachment trial, which
most people in both audiences made it clear they did not want to
discuss. One constituent, Janie Wilson, owner of a carpet and
upholstery cleaning business in Portland, did implore both men to
vote to remove Clinton from office. She asked that they ``put
yourselves in the shoes of women'' when considering their vote,
then offered to remove both of her shoes and give one to each
senator to remind them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure they'll fit, but I will remember that offer,''
Smith deadpanned as the audience broke into laughter. And Wyden
followed up, ``I'm not sure we need another scandal, taking your
shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith did take the moment to criticize President Clinton, and to
say more nice things about himself and his colleague. ``You know
how how often I think about chasing my employees?'' he said.
``About as often as I think of holding up a 7-Eleven. We as public
servants _ I'm so proud of Ron. I don't wonder where he goes when
he goes home at night, and I don't think he worries about me
either. We owe it to you to set the highest example, not the lowest
example.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Oregon senators' relationship will become strained
remains to be seen. But Wyden just won a resounding re-election
victory, and Smith's term is not up until 2002, so they clearly
seem to have years of bipartisan cooperation ahead of them. Having
dealt with Smith as the enemy and now having dealt with him as a
friend, Wyden said he was inclined to recommend that his colleagues
in Washington reach out across the great partisan divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say, just try it,'' Wyden said in an interview. ``It's not
going to bite you.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Swimming is different from other sports because you
do it in water, and man can't breathe in water.
</P>
<P>
   When I decided to enter a triathlon in Hawaii that involved a
mile-long swim this winter, I thought a little formal training
might help and I signed up for Doug Stern's six-session beginner's
swim clinic at Columbia Prep School on West 93d Street.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, a highly animated 55-year-old retired high school teacher
with a little bathing suit and big muscles, began the first class
by asking us: ``Who are you? And why are you here?''
</P>
<P>
   We were 15 New Yorkers, with nearly as many body types and
motivations, in a pool 20 yards long. There were injured runners
looking for a fitness alternative, aspiring triathletes (one woman
had just completed her first event using the backstroke), as well
as swimmers who lacked the skills to improve. A man in his 50s, a
runner with a bad knee, was afraid to put his head underwater. An
overweight woman (``a dumpling,'' in Stern's parlance) wanted to
get in shape without taxing her joints. An actress who moonlighted
as a belly dancer had not liked other forms of exercise she had
tried.
</P>
<P>
   Stern has been a swim coach for 36 years. Through the turmoil of
an angry adolescence, the breakup of his first marriage and the
death of his brother _ a standout backstroker who died of cancer at
43 _ swimming has been the one constant in his life. ``Focusing on
a series of repetitive movements calms the mind,'' he said. ``It's
one of the ultimate mantras.''
</P>
<P>
   His teaching philosophy, which he presented with the fervor of
an infomercial, focuses on paying attention to what one is doing on
a sensory level. ``Swimming is about feel,'' he said. ``You have to
get out of your head and into your body. You need to watch your
hands enter the water, feel the water when you kick, hold the
glide. This is a very sensual experience. It's wild!''
</P>
<P>
   That first class was more about talk than action. In the next
week's session the swimming turned serious. Stern broke down the
components of the free-style stroke, demonstrating them on land and
in the water. ``Swimming is about flow lines,'' he said. In other
words, making your body ``long'' (reaching out to grab the water)
and rotating on your side reduces drag and increases glide. While
this may sound like Physics 101, the mechanics of the free-style
stroke can be explained in three minutes. Integrating it is another
story.
</P>
<P>
   Everything we did for the next four weeks was intended to
solidify the stroke in our bodies and in our minds. No matter the
drill, Stern hustled along the deck of the pool shouting, pleading,
cajoling, a combination of Soupy Sales and Mister Rogers, with
volume. ``Use your hips when you kick!'' ``Point your toes!'' ``See
your hands enter the water!'' ``Let your hand hang limp!'' and so
forth. ``Swimming is about feel! Feel it, feel it, feel it!'' he'd
bark, like a New Age drill sergeant with a New York accent.
</P>
<P>
   During the ensuing weeks I was moving through the water faster
and more efficiently even though I wasn't swimming between classes.
On the train home to Brooklyn after each class I felt calm and
weary and a little high _ the post-swim ``ultimate mantra'' buzz
that makes the sport so addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Each week we added distance to improve our conditioning, and did
more drills to increase body awareness. For example, during the
third 90-minute session we did a thoroughly ridiculous, exhausting
exercise called ``chicken wings,'' which involved sticking our
thumbs under our armpits and flap-stroking across the pool. The
aim? To insure high elbow lift and recovery _ two key elements to a
faster free-style stroke. Afterward Stern gazed admiringly at his
hands and said: ``When you unfold your arms, you realize how great
these things really are!''
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the final class was another time trial. Five
weeks earlier I'd done 19 laps in 10 minutes; this time I logged
24. After I finished my test, I sat next to Stern trying to catch
my breath while the rest of the class did battle with the clock.
</P>
<P>
   It was inspiring to watch. The backstroking triathlete swam face
down gracefully; the ``dumpling'' who had floundered now doggedly
powered across the pool. The man who couldn't put his face in the
water, who had barely been able to do one lap without coughing up
water, increased his total from 6 to 13 laps. The aimless belly
dancer swam with purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with better technique and a reassuring words of wisdom
from Stern, on Maui's south shore I waited anxiously with 299 other
hard bodies at the start of a triathlon called Xterra. In past
races, if I started slowly I was left in the wake. If I swam too
fast, I went to pieces, hyperventilating and resorting to a dog
paddle.
</P>
<P>
   Lining up on the outside to avoid the churning masses, I did
what I had been taught by Stern: bringing full body awareness to my
swimming. I concentrated on lifting my shoulders out of the water,
relaxing my hands at the elbow, stretching as far forward as I
could. I let my body roll and glide on its side, locked onto the
water with a bent wrist and pulled and then pushed the water toward
my thigh. Before you could say Johnny Weissmuller I found a rhythm,
felt at ease and was moving efficiently, even passing people. More
important, my poor swim performances in past triathlons made more
sense to me: subpar form and unconscious fear exacerbated by the
stress of competition.
</P>
<P>
   As I made my way from sea to land en route to the transition
area where my bike waited, I glanced up at the clock on the beach.
I'd covered the mile in 24:44, well behind the top dogs but faster
than I'd ever gone before. For the first time in a lifetime of
swimming, I felt like a real swimmer.
</P>

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST SEEMS LESS AT EASE IN SENATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ William H. Rehnquist was in strange territory
Thursday, both for him and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice left the familiar confines of the U.S. Supreme
Court and entered the Senate chamber to oversee the impeachment
trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The trial marks only the second time in U.S. history that the
Senate has considered expelling a chief executive for ``high crimes
and misdemeanors.'' President Andrew Johnson was tried in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist, a part-time historian, chronicled Johnson's
impeachment trial in a 1992 book ``Grand Inquests.'' Johnson was
acquitted by a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the full-time job he has held since 1986, Rehnquist, 74,
appears to be at home as he leads the Supreme Court with an iron
fist. But, in presiding over the Senate trial, the jurist seemed
less at ease, referring often to written instructions for himself.
</P>
<P>
   After pounding his gavel to bring the Senate to order,
Rehnquist, looking at the piece of paper before him, said, ``The
Senate will convene as a court of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist, bedecked in the same black robe with gold stripes
that he wears at the high court, also provided a personal statement
to the senators, explaining that he would have to stand often
because of a bad back. Attorneys who argue before the Supreme Court
are familiar with the chief justice's condition, as he often has to
rise and leave the courtroom briefly during their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   At the high court, Rehnquist runs a tight ship, often cutting
lawyers off in mid-syllable when their allotted time has expired.
But the chief justice Thursday exercised no such control as House
prosecutors proceeded uninterrupted with their arguments against
the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate trial, after all, belongs to the senators, with
Rehnquist there merely to oversee the proceedings. It is the
senators who have the constitutional authority to try impeachments.
The chief justice, by contrast, has the constitutional duty to
preside over the trial of the president.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rehnquist's silence Thursday might end as the trial
proceeds. The chief justice might be called upon in coming days to
rule on prosecution and defense motions, such as whether testimony
and evidence should be limited or expanded.
</P>
<P>
   But, under the rules of the unique trial, Rehnquist's decisions
can be overturned by a majority vote of the senators taken at the
request of a single senator. Such an event would be unusual for the
chief justice, who is not accustomed to being contradicted while he
is wearing his robe.
</P>
<P>
   During oral arguments at the Supreme Court, Rehnquist can be
intimidating to attorneys and to spectators.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice often cuts lawyers off with a brusque ``thank
you'' when their allotted time for argument, generally 30 minutes,
has expired. As spectators stand to leave the courtroom between
cases, the chief justice's booming voice regularly captures their
attention, freezing them in place, as he admonishes (his phrase)
them to be quiet because the court remains in session.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist, in sharp contrast to his high court behavior,
remained silent Thursday as House prosecutors began to lay out
their case that Clinton lied to a federal grand jury and obstructed
justice in an ill-fated effort to conceal an extramarital affair
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after opening the trial, Rehnquist yielded to the Senate
chaplain for a prayer and then to the sergeant-at-arms to remind
the senators that they must remain silent while observing the trial
under penalty of imprisonment. He also ordered that Senate
resolutions regarding the conduct of the trial be inserted in the
Congressional Record.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings then largely belonged to House prosecutors, who
treated Rehnquist with the utmost respect, addressing him as ``Mr.
Chief Justice'' before launching into their arguments for the
conviction of the president. The senators also deferred to the
chief justice, rising from their seats both when Rehnquist entered
and when he left the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate has not always been kind to the chief justice,
who was nominated to the court's top spot by President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the Senate confirmed Rehnquist to be chief justice on a
vote of 65-33 on Sept. 17, 1986, giving him the dubious distinction
of having received the greatest number of negative votes of any of
the 16 chief justices in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who now sits in judgment of Clinton,
said at the time that Rehnquist's ``ideological fervor has
distorted his judgment and objectivity.'' Another Senate juror,
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., called Rehnquist ``too extreme to be
chief justice.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rehnquist received 26 negative Senate votes when he
was confirmed to the bench in 1971 as an associate justice
following his nomination by Richard Nixon. That number of no votes
tied him at the time with former Justices Mahlon Pitney and Charles
Evans Hughes for the highest number of Senate rejections for any
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Clarence Thomas, who squeaked through the Senate on a
52-48 vote in 1991, holds the record for negative votes.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist, despite his love of history, placed the four gold
stripes on each sleeve of his robe on Jan. 17, 1995, not as a link
to the past but to emulate the Lord Chancellor character in Gilbert
and Sullivan's play ``Iolanthe,'' which the chief justice enjoyed.
In that play, the Lord Chancellor sings, ``The law is the true
embodiment of everything that's excellent. It has no kind of fault
or flaw, and I, my lords, embody the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the impeachment trial it will be the senators, not the
chief justice, who decide what is the law.

 &HT;    Conyers man's battle to regain his eyesight provides inspiration
for big-screen romance
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shirl Jennings doesn't look people in the eye when he
talks to them, which is disconcerting. But he isn't being rude or
shy.
</P>
<P>
   He can see, all right. He just hasn't gotten used to making eye
contact during a conversation. He forgets to look down, too, for
curbs and chairs and other obstacles below eye level.
</P>
<P>
   When he was blind, as he was for most of his 58 years, he never
had to worry about such things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so used to looking straight ahead,'' the Conyers (Ga.)
resident said good-humoredly. ``Being blind was more easy
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings is among the 20 or so people ever known to have
regained their eyesight after lifelong blindness. A professional
masseur, he was blind for more than 40 years until two operations
in 1991 restored his sight.
</P>
<P>
   His extraordinary metamorphosis made headlines at the time and
was the subject of a 1995 article in The New Yorker magazine, ``To
See or Not See,'' by neurologist Oliver Sacks. His experiences also
inspired the movie romance ``At First Sight,'' starring Val Kilmer
and Mira Sorvino, which opens Friday in Atlanta theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect the movie to tell Jennings' life story _ key
elements have been altered, Hollywood-style. The film is set in New
York instead of metro Atlanta, and the main characters are much
younger than Jennings and his wife, Barbara, who is 51.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Jenningses say the movie is surprisingly accurate on
what is to them the most crucial point: For those who have learned
to live without it, the gift of eyesight can be a tremendous,
overwhelming burden.
</P>
<P>
   When Jennings regained his eyesight, his doctors discovered he
had lost virtually all visual memory. His eyes were functioning,
yet the visual cues he was receiving seemed at odds with the
sounds, smells and textures that for decades had been his means of
observing the world.
</P>
<P>
   Faces were meaningless blurs; airplanes flying at 30,000 feet
seemed to skim inches over his head. He could not recognize a whole
tree, let alone a forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew the top and bottom separately, the trunk, the
leaves,'' Mrs. Jennings said. ``It took him 6 months to put a tree
together.''
</P>
<P>
   He faced other adjustments no one had anticipated. As a masseur
for 25 years at the DeKalb YMCA (Ga.), Jennings had felt secure in
his familiarity with skin and hair, muscle and bone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came home to me one day and growled, `I can see the bodies
I'm working on, and I don't like it!' '' Barbara laughed.
</P>
<P>
   There were laughs, but far more frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1940 in Bedford County, Va., Shirley Jennings was a
lively toddler until age 3, when he became dangerously ill with
three illnesses at once: meningitis, polio and cat scratch fever.
</P>
<P>
   His sickness plunged him into a coma, from which he emerged
after two weeks with paralyzed legs and damaged eyesight. Jennings'
determined 17-year-old mother got his cousins to help him relearn
how to crawl and walk, a process that took two or three years and
ultimately succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   But his eyesight continued to deteriorate. When he was 7 or 8,
Jennings was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive,
untreatable disease of the retina that causes blindness. By the
time he was 10, he could distinguish only light from dark.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, Jennings learned to live sightless. He attended
the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind in Staunton, Va., and
later the YMCA School of Swedish Massage.
</P>
<P>
   He learned to recognize people by their footfalls, by the feel
of their skin. Fellow blind masseurs passed along clients' more
unusual characteristics, such as a hairy foot, and when Jennings
encountered these people on his massage table, he astonished them
by identifying them by name.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, he became resigned to his blindness, as
consistency at work and at home taught him contentment. That began
to change in the late 1980s when he heard that an old girlfriend,
Barbara, whom he had dated two decades earlier, had divorced her
husband and returned to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called,'' Jennings said. ``She had a beautiful, distinctive
voice. After 20 years, we were right back where we were before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wouldn't let me get away this time,'' Mrs. Jennings
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, soon after they started dating again, she urged
Jennings to visit her family ophthalmologist in Dunwoody (Ga.), Dr.
Trevor Woodhams. Jennings hadn't been to an eye doctor in 10 years,
thinking it futile. But she was adamant that he seek a fresh
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had already reconciled himself to the fact that he would
never see again,'' Woodhams recalled. ``He was humoring Barbara,
that was how it appeared to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Woodhams was interested. Jennings had extremely
dense cataracts, so opaque it was impossible to determine the
condition of his retinas, supposedly degraded beyond repair by
retinitis pigmentosa.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, tests of the optic nerves showed they were still
viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the capacity of some vision,'' Woodhams said. ``How
much was anybody's guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodhams speculated that removing the cataracts might restore
Jennings' eyesight. Jennings was hesitant, saying it was too much
trouble and expense for such a small chance of return.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Barbara's attitude was, if there's any chance at all,
let's go for it,'' Woodhams said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jennings' intensely bright blue eyes don't so much as
twinkle as she downplays her role in her husband's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to stay out of it,'' she insisted. ``He had to live with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was worth a gamble,'' Jennings said with a nod.
</P>
<P>
   Woodhams spends most Monday mornings in surgical scrubs,
performing cataract removal operations at the surgical center
adjoining his Dunwoody clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure has not changed drastically in the seven years
since he used it to restore Jennings' eyesight. One difference is
that Woodhams now uses a local anesthetic that allows the patient
to see as soon as a few hours after surgery. In Jennings' case, he
used a shot that temporarily paralyzed the optic nerve, which kept
them from learning the outcome until the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Woodhams in surgery is marvelous. His hands, small and
finely shaped, are all that moves when he operates; the rest of his
body remains absolutely still, his torso upright and his eyes
locked onto the microscope that magnifies the patient's eye to
roughly 20 times actual size.
</P>
<P>
   Using an ultrasound tool he describes as a tiny jackhammer,
Woodhams scrapes away the existing lens. Through the microscope,
one can see the instrument plowing minuscule furrows in the lens,
gradually revealing the clear pupil beneath.
</P>
<P>
   Woodhams inserts a minute tube within the thin membrane covering
the eye and deftly implants the new artificial lens. Then he gently
nudges the iris back into shape around the lens. No stitches are
required.
</P>
<P>
   The entire operation takes no more than half an hour. Woodhams
shrugs out of his sterile gown, stuffs his surgical cap in the
pocket of his scrubs and recalls how Jennings' first operation in
September 1991, to remove the cataract in the right eye, was
nothing heroic.

 &HT;    Ball to share earnings with slave descendants
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If some of Edward Ball's relatives had had their way, ``Slaves
in the Family'' never would have been written. Everyone knew the
South Carolina family had owned slaves, but, as Ball's father would
say, ``There are five things we don't talk about in the Ball
family. Religion, sex, death, money and the Negroes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Slaves in the Family'' (Random House, $15.95 paperback)
changed all that by exposing shameful incidents in his family's
past that were never discussed. By sifting through written records
and interviewing descendants of his family's slaves, Ball
reconstructed a powerful, award-winning story of pride and shame.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ball wants to do more to make amends to the descendants of
his family's 4,000 slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm setting aside a quarter of my earnings from the book to
fund a small foundation,'' says Ball, 40, a former Village Voice
columnist who lives in Summerville, S.C., northwest of Charleston.
``Several family members are joining with me. What we intend to do
is work with some of the descendants of the slaves,
collaboratively, for a restitution program. It's not one family
trying to expunge its guilt by handing out checks; it's a shared
project _ black people working with white people _ to find some
response to this joint heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing educational and other grants to the
descendants of his family's slaves, Ball hopes to fund the
construction of monuments where people reflect on the legacy of
slavery. ``I think we should commemorate the tragic parts of our
history as well as the patriotic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball expects some resistance to the idea, but he points out
there was opposition to the Vietnam War Memorial when it was first
built. ``Now what you have is an enormous catharsis and an enormous
healing around that monument.''
</P>
<P>
   LOVE AND LITERATURE: When people ask Connecticut writer Luanne
Rice what her novels are about, she always says the same thing:
They're about love.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life I have searched for the thread that holds people
together,'' she says. ``It's what intrigues me most as a writer _
that invisible but unbreakable filament that keeps people connected
through joys, despair, absences, betrayals, even death.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was her mother's death that prompted Rice to write
her latest novel, ``Cloud Nine'' (Bantam, $19.95). Watching her
mother slowly die of cancer, Rice began wondering how it would feel
to face death. In the novel, Sarah Talbot has survived a bout with
a life-threatening illness and reopened her bedding shop, Cloud
Nine. To celebrate her survival, Sarah charters a plane ride over
upstate New York to view the fall foliage. On the trip, she meets
and falls in love with Will Burke, a former Navy pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Such happily-ever-after plots have endeared Rice to readers but
not to some critics who dismiss her as romance writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain prejudice,'' agrees Rice, 42, whose novel
``Blue Moon'' has been adapted for a spring CBS movie. ``But what
some critics don't understand is how much intensity and drama there
are in families. No matter what kind of family it is, the greatest
passion happens at home _ everything from the heartwarming side of
life to explosive tempers.''
</P>
<P>
   A MOMENT IN HISTORY: For those who participated in the
Montgomery bus boycott and the subsequent civil rights struggle,
the memories are as vivid as yesterday. But, as civil rights leader
Fred D. Gray learned a couple of years ago, many young
African-Americans do not know who Rosa Parks is or that her arrest
for refusing to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus in 1955 was
the catalyst that sparked the civil rights movement and thrust the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., then 27, into the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   To help preserve that legacy, Willy S. Leventhal has compiled a
collection of oral histories from many of the participants in the
boycott in ``The Children Coming On ... A Retrospective of the
Montgomery Bus Boycott'' (Black Belt Press, $21.95). There are some
excellent histories of the movement, Leventhal notes, but none
``provides the wide-angle view of the city, the involved
individuals, the court cases or the American political climate
found in the chapters and oral histories of this retrospective.''

 &HT;    The nation's most unconventional courtroom
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A screenwriter of our acquaintance, opining
recently about the cluelessness of people in the movie business,
told the story of an assistant producer who didn't understand that
in a trial, the selection of a jury precedes the rendering of a
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's really clueless. On the other hand, as the first day
of arguments in Bill Clinton's impeachment trial showed, legal
proceedings can sometimes be ordered in unconventional ways.
</P>
<P>
   This one began, most decidedly, with the jury, all 100 of them.
The senators were a picture of conviviality as they took their
seats Thursday: Democrat Robert Byrd of West Virginia threw his arm
around the shoulder of Republican Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania,
while Republicans Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and John Warner
of Virginia chatted amiably with David Kendall, the president's
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to read something from the body language of the jurors
became a major activity, as the afternoon filled with the
methodical recitation of facts already nationally familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy seemed to be listening intently
to Rep. Ed Bryant's detailed examination of Monica Lewinsky's job
search, while a couple of the senators appeared at times to nod.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's senior senator, Paul Coverdell, sat with his arms
crossed in a pose characteristic of him. Nearby, Democrat Fritz
Hollings of South Carolina, recovering from eye surgery, wore dark
shades much of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Jaded by the thrill-a-minute climax of the House impeachment
vote, many observers were bored by the solid, predictable approach
of the House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Max Cleland, Georgia's Democratic senator, emerged from the
Senate chamber with a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it engaging ... compelling. I found myself drawn into
the case like I had not been before,'' Cleland said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said the prosecutors were ``connecting a lot of the
dots'' _ which was exactly what they set out to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're presenting, for the first time, Point A to Point Z
chronology of events,'' said former congressional investigator
David Bossie, the investigator who resigned from Rep. Dan Burton's
committee in the flap over selected editing of Clinton associate
Webb Hubbell's taped phone calls from prison to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this orderly presentation of the facts, the White House
will be compelled to dispute the facts and call witnesses to refute
them, or else there's a hundred people sitting in that room who are
going to have to vote their consciences,'' Bossie said.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the most controversial way in which the order
of this proceeding diverges from a normal trial. Prosecutors
generally talk about what the testimony of witnesses will prove. In
this trial, however, their first job was to convince the jurors to
call the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four House members who spoke Thursday after
Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde's introduction hammered on the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me ask you two questions,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson of
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, can you convict the president of the United States
without hearing personally the testimony of the key witnesses?
Second, can you dismiss the charges under this strong set of facts
and circumstances without hearing and evaluating the credibility of
the key witness?''
</P>
<P>
   In the case described by the House prosecutors Thursday _ one
which focused strictly on perjury and obstruction of justice and
avoided lurid details, the key witness might well be Betty Currie,
the president's secretary. The Arkansas Republican suggested the
senators might be able to parse the truth by the way she shifted in
her chair when asked a question.
</P>
<P>
   But presumably, the ``key witness'' Hutchinson was speaking of
is Monica Lewinsky, which gets to the reason why the jurors in this
case are leery about witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Basing so much of this prosecution on the need for calling
witnesses risks trying the patience of the senator-jurors, who are
not accustomed to having House members exhort them in this fashion.
</P>
<P>
   It also suggests that no matter how sturdily they assemble the
sworn record, no matter how carefully they connect the dots, the
House impeachment managers don't think they can clinch this case
without the drama of witnesses, appearing live in the most
unconventional of courtrooms.

 &HT;    An arts festival makes Bermuda even warmer in winter
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are several good reasons to visit Bermuda in winter _ not
the least of which is the Bermuda Festival of the Performing Arts,
continuing through Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The 24th annual event features international performers,
including the King's Singers, Steve Love's New York Express Roller
Dance Company, the Dallas Black Dance Theatre, the English Chamber
Theatre, London Winds and the Black Sea State Philharmonic
Orchestra. The Bermuda Musical and Dramatic Society will present
the suspense drama ``Wait Until Dark.''

<P>
   Winter visitors to the remote Atlantic island can also take
advantage of balmy temperatures in the low 70s as well as discounts
at hotels and resorts. Call Bermuda Tourism at 1-800-237-6832 for
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there is easy: Delta offers daily nonstop service at
$288, with a three-day advance purchase, for travel through March
15. Purchase tickets by Wednesday. (American, Continental and
USAirways match the fare but do not offer nonstop flights from
Atlanta.)
</P>
<P>
   ``In a little over two hours, you can be in this other world,''
says the Hon. David H. Allen, Bermuda's new minister of tourism.
Allen, who visited Atlanta recently, was appointed after the
Progressive Labour Party's Nov. 9 victory. He says tours are being
organized to promote the island's heritage and eco-tourism sites
and provide cultural and educational opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   With new resorts being built and old ones being revitalized,
Allen says, Bermuda is experiencing ``a sense of renewal.''

</P>
<P>
   Despite Russia's economic problems, Moscow remains a world-class
city and vital tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Americans who visit us this winter will find a clean,
modern city with a vivid past and a vibrant present,'' pledges
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov. ``Our theaters, museums and art
galleries continue to flourish. New luxury hotels are open, and a
number of construction projects are going forward.''

citizens in the months preceding the Revolution.

 &HT;    NBC is rethinking sex, families and race
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Scott Sassa is de-sexing the Peacock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have less emphasis on sex,'' the new NBC
Entertainment president, who's had the job since October, said
Thursday at his first big meeting with the nation's TV critics
gathered here to preview new midseason shows.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa said he wasn't talking about removing sexual references or
scenes from all his shows. ``I'm not saying `No sex.' I'm saying
less sex,'' he said. ``We just need to try to lessen the amount of
sex that's gratuitous. People want to be able to watch television
with their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Sassa also said he wants to see more shows with traditional
families on NBC, pointing out the network has only one show now on
the air with two parents and a child, ``Mad About You.'' ``We've
shifted too far away from the traditional family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he added that he'd like to see more shows set in cities
other than New York City and more racial and ethnic diversity in
NBC's sitcoms, which have been criticized for having very few
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa said he isn't trying to turn NBC into a family channel and
that his remarks should not be considered a big turnaround for NBC.
But they were certainly the first time an NBC executive has
volunteered the insight that his network only has one show based on
a traditional family.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa has inherited an NBC Entertainment division that has lost
a lot of audience this season, because of the end of ``Seinfeld,''
the loss of pro football and the NBA lockout. But the network
remains No. 1 in the demographic advertisers want most, 18- to
49-year-olds. He's been considered a rising executive for years,
particularly during his nine years at Turner Broadcasting System,
where he helped launch TNT and the Cartoon Network and eventually
ended up as president of Turner Entertainment Group. He's one of
two major executives making recent transitions from cable to
broadcasting, the other being Doug Herzog, who just moved from
Comedy Central to Fox.
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   History aimed at kids
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's ``Selma, Lord, Selma'' is a moving King holiday primer
from ``The Wonderful World of Disney'' (7 p.m. on ABC), a kind of
living textbook through which preteens can appreciate the meaning
and courage of the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in Atlanta, Griffin and Selma, Ala., this two-hour movie,
directed by Mississippi native Charles Burnett (``To Sleep With
Anger,'' ``Oprah Winfrey Presents `The Wedding' ''), centers on one
of the movement's pivotal confrontations: In 1965, black
protestors, led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., were beaten by
police as they marched for integration across Selma's Edmund Pettus
Bridge _ an event known famously as Bloody Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The events are seen through the eyes of 11-year-old Sheyann
Webb, played by Jurnee Smollett with the same incandescent
youthfulness she displayed in ``Eve's Bayou.'' It is through the
personal changes Sheyann experiences _ from eager idealist, to
frightened participant, to empowered defender of her people's
rights _ that the changes brought about by Selma's bloody battle
are brought home for viewers.

warmly accessible, which is how most of the movie plays.

   It's awash in an intentional melodrama until the actual
confrontation, the drama of which is captured with a perfectly
transcendent touch. It ensures the movie will remain with the kids
who watch it, and the parents who watch with them, long after it
ends. Yolanda King (``Ghosts of Mississippi''), one of the slain
civil rights leader's daughters, plays a schoolteacher who goes
through her own transformation.

   Mayhem on skates
</P>
<P>
   Tonight on the Nashville Network, you won't see hunky cowboys in
hats, steel guitars or anglers reeling in the big one. TNN's newest
show _ the one on which it's betting its future in an attempt to
lure the young _ is a spitting, hitting, hair-yanking late '90s
version of ``Roller Derby.'' Yes, Hank fans, TNN is bringing you a
show best described as ``Jerry Springer'' on skates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rollerjam'' (8 p.m. ) is an update of the old rink sport. The
rules and routine are basically the same as the days when beefy men
and switchblade-tough women battled it out on wooden racetracks.
Skaters go over the railing. They jab each other in the ribs.
There's lots of fighting on the floor as a fat referee pulls
members of teams such as the New York Enforcers and the Florida
Sundogs off each other. You've got your jock announcers, and of
course the good vs. evil story lines. But the look is totally '90s
_ inline skates, a track with polymax surface and computer
graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Producers are apparently trying to lure wrestling fans to TNN,
but the action here is a bit more confusing than a piledriver.
First, you have to think. The scoring process is sometimes
difficult to follow, more like bowling than Brawl at the Beach. The
characters _ bad girl Heather ``the Gun'' Gunnin, ``Titan'' Tim
Washington _ aren't as campy as their wrestling counterparts, and
the taunts (Heather ``the Gun'' smashes an injured opponent's
crutch) don't seem as hate-filled as they should.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest appeal will be the female skaters, who often
could pass as ``Baywatch'' extras. No doubt the show's producers
are aware of the naughty undercurrent. At least five times during
tonight's debut, announcers confess: ``You know, there's something
that really turns me on about watching women fight.''

R.I. COMPUTER HACKER SENTENCED TO A YEAR IN PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A Rhode Island man was sentenced Thursday to a year and
a day in prison after admitting that he led a nationwide
computer-hacking group known as the ``Virii.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a sentencing hearing Thursday in US District Court, Judge
Patti Saris questioned whether the Internet service disruptions and
other damages caused by 21-year-old Sean Trifero added up to as
much as $67,500, as prosecutors claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Saris also rejected a request by prosecutors that Trifero
continue to be banned from the Internet, a setback to the
government's contentions that the group he led threatened national
security interests.
</P>
<P>
   Trifero could have received a maximum sentence of 18 months in
prison after pleading guilty to computer fraud charges, but
prosecutors recommended the lesser sentence. They also agreed to
allow Trifero to serve his sentence in a federal ``boot camp,''
with the result that he will likely be released in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Trifero's case has been seen as a test of the Justice
Department's ongoing campaign against hackers, who prosecutors
contend pose a serious threat to computer networks. Critics say,
however, that cases against young hackers like Trifero have been
overblown, and that the real danger to these networks comes from
disgruntled corporate insiders.
</P>
<P>
   In response, prosecutors note that members of the Virii have
bragged of breaking in to computers belonging to NASA and other
government agencies. Last year, two California high school students
connected to the Virii admitted they snooped through Pentagon
computers, and were sentenced to probation. Trifero was not charged
in connection with those events.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Trifero pled guilty to criminal charges that he
tapped into five academic and commercial computing systems without
permission in 1996 and 1997, distrupting on-line services at
Harvard and Amherst Colleges, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Trifero's role in the hacking group wasn't clear until Thursday
when, on the witness stand, the thin and sharp-featured young man
was asked by prosecutor Jeanne Kempthorne to describe his
connection to the Virii.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to run it,'' Trifero replied.
</P>
<P>
   But Trifero insisted the group's main motive was only to test
computer security, not abuse systems. Saris suggested he might find
a better way of applying his skills after his release, such as
teaching children how to use computers. The $8-an-hour job computer
consulting job he recently started, she said, was a waste of his
talents.
</P>
<P>
   Saris said she was ``appalled'' at how little Trifero earns,
adding that ``other people were charging $50 a hour to fix the
problems you created.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to serving his sentence, Trifero may have to pay for
the damages he caused. The exact figure remains in dispute pending
further hearings. Thursday, Saris questioned government estimates,
which included $29,500 in damages to a Nebraska Internet service
provider and $27,000 in damages stemming from his computer break-in
at Harvard. Prosecutors and the institutions involved have declined
to discuss how they arrived at those amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Trifero admits that he and others members of the Virii intruded
into computers, shut down chat rooms and used abusive language
on-line. But in an interview after Thursday's sentencing hearing,
Tifero, surrounded by his family, repeated his claim that such
activities weren't malicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel badly that they couldn't patch up their systems
easily,'' Trifero said of those whose computer services he
disrupted. ``But my intention wasn't to steal money out of their
pockets. It was to learn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his release, Trifero plans to return to college. He said he
looked forward to trading e-mail with other Virii members again
with the lifitng of the court order banning him from the Internet.
He also said he might start a computer-security consulting firm
after his release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do want to start a business of some type,'' he said. ``It
would make sense to do what I know.''

STOCKS TUMBLE N BRAZIL AMID FEARS OF FURTHER CURRENCY WEAKNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Propelled by a drop in Brazil's
international credit rating and growing doubts about the
government's ability to defend the country's newly devalued
currency, the Brazilian stock market was forced to suspend trading
on Thursday for the second consecutive day, and it closed down
nearly 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the sense of crisis here, interest rates soared and
capital outflows continued.
</P>
<P>
   Continued uncertainty about Brazil's prospects contributed to a
second day of weak performances by stock markets around the world
and fanned fears that the problems of Latin America's largest
economy could soon spread to other countries in the region. The Dow
Jones industrial average fell by more than 200 points and major
stock markets in Europe and Asia declined slightly, while those
throughout Latin America fell more sharply.
</P>
<P>
   As the stock market here was tumbling, pressure on Brazil's
currency, the real, continued. After the de facto devaluation of
more than 8 percent that was announced on Wednesday, the real
managed to hold steady on Thursday at the very top of the new
official trading band established by the central bank, 1.32 to the
dollar, as compared with 1.21 to the dollar before Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the day, nervous consumers and professional
speculators were testing the new rate, forcing the central bank to
use its reserves, which have shrunk to less than half the $75
billion Brazil had on hand before the eruption of the Russian
crisis last summer. At private currency exchanges, the real traded
at about 5 percent above the official rate, as middle-class
Brazilians with memories of the currency instability that prevailed
until recent years sought their traditional refuge in times of
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we are going to go back to the days when our
currency lost value every single day,'' said Jose Dirceu Amaral
Chaves, a salesman who was waiting to buy dollars on Thursday
afternoon at a currency exchange in Ipanema. ``But I need to
protect myself and my family if things get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision to allow the real to slide in value against
the dollar came after months of protestations by Brazilian
officials that such a step was not only unnecessary but also would
damage their efforts to stabilize the Brazilian economy, the
world's eighth-largest, after years of high inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But that policy drove interest rates to intolerable levels,
nearly 50 percent, which in turn suppressed both consumer purchases
and business expansion, driving the country into recession. After
declining to about 33 percent late last year, interest rate futures
rose on Thursday to record levels. Contracts maturing in February
closed at 71.65 percent compared with 38.70 percent on Wednesday,
while those for March climbed to 59.41 percent from 42.78 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian government has allowed interest rates to rise so
high as part of its strategy to keep its currency stable. Officials
have reasoned that the lure of astronomical interest rates would
encourage investors to leave their money in accounts in the local
currency, rather than deposit billions in dollars overseas at a
lower rate of return.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, though, the government's iron defense of the
real made Brazilian exports more expensive than those of many of
its competitors and made imports artificially cheap, encouraging
Brazilians to binge on consumer goods and foreign travel. That, in
turn, accelerated the drain of Brazil's reserves of foreign
currency, adding to the pressure for a devaluation of the real.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian officials say they expect that once investors accept
that a realistic exchange rate has been achieved, interest rates
will gradually fall. They say that interest rate spikes like
Thursday's are a natural, but short-lived, phenomenon _ the result
of the market testing Brazil's resolve to maintain the new exchange
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, argue that Brazil's currency is still
overvalued by as much as 30 percent and that President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso and his advisers will only waste additional
reserves and prolong the country's crisis by attempting to defend
the new rate. Many of those critics maintain that Brazil can
resolve its current difficulties only by allowing the market to
determine the true value of the currency.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, rumors that Brazil will soon abandon the new rate
altogether and allow the real to float freely were so strong today
that the central bank was compelled to issue a statement this
afternoon denying that any such plan is under consideration. At the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, futures contracts for the real reached
their maximum daily fluctuation, with contracts for the end of this
month hitting 1.396 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the uncertainty, dollars continued to flow out of Brazil.
Nervous investors, both foreigners and Brazilians, sent more than
$1.25 billion abroad on Thursday, bringing the total for the month
to about $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about the viability of the new exchange rate and the
likelihood of continued high interest rates led Standard &AMP; Poor's
Corp. to lower its rating on Thursday on $58.1 billion of Brazilian
foreign debt from B plus to BB minus, a significant downgrading
that was widely publicized by television, radio and other news
outlets here. An overall ``outlook negative'' rating accompanied
that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The downgrade and negative outlook reflect the heightened
risks to financial recovery posed by yesterday's shift in exchange
rate policy in the context of an unfinished reform agenda and
extremely fragile market confidence,'' the rating service explained
in a statement. ``Pressure on the exchange rate is unlikely to
abate and net capital flows are expected to remain negative for
months.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some discouraging economic statistics announced by the central
bank on Thursday also appeared to have fed the stock market
collapse. Public sector domestic debt, for instance, rose by $7
billion in October and now amounts to 40.9 percent of gross
domestic product, an increase of 1.2 percent of GDP in just one
month.
</P>
<P>
   Also contributing to the steep decline on Thursday, analysts
said, was the resignation of Claudio Mauch, a key central bank
official, one day after Gustavo Franco, president of the central
bank, stepped down. In his parting remarks, Mauch said that while
one of two of Brazil's more than 200 banks may encounter some
problems as a result of the change in exchange rate policy, ``There
is nothing that is about to explode.''
</P>
<P>
   With the pressure against Brazil and its currency mounting,
foreign governments and international lending institutions
continued to issue statements of support for Cardoso and his
economic team. In Washington, Enrique Iglesias, president of the
Inter-American Development Bank, described the behavior of
international markets as irrational and praised the Brazilian
government's commitment to economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very surprised the markets have not appreciated the
immense efforts Brazil is undertaking on fiscal reform,'' he said.
In a separate statement, the bank, one of the principal
contributors to the $41.5 billion bailout package for Brazil
announced in November, argued that Brazil is moving to resolve the
problems in its budget and social security system that the rescue
plan addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Among ordinary Brazilians, however, confidence has clearly been
shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to recognize this morning that in a single day we have
become nearly 10 percent poorer,'' Gazeta Mercantil, Brazil's
principal business newspaper, glumly concluded in a front page
commentary.

SENATOR PLANS BILL TO EXPAND 401(K) PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., Texas)  (mk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new type of 401(k) retirement savings plan that would allow
withdrawals free of taxes is expected to be proposed Friday by the
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would greatly expand Americans' savings options and
would allow them to save far more each year in retirement accounts.
It could even raise money initially for the federal government
because workers would pay income taxes on the money they contribute
to the new plan, not on what they take out.
</P>
<P>
   But over the long term, it would deplete revenues and is
expected to face opposition from the Clinton administration and
Democrats in Congress, where it will be one of several competing
ideas about how to cut taxes this year. Clinton has said he will
oppose any tax cut until an agreement is reached to shore up a
looming shortfall in Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The major portion of the proposal, called a Roth 401(k), would
be an extension of the popular 401(k) plans for employees and would
operate on the same principles as the recently created Roth IRA,
said Sen. William Roth Jr., R-Del., chairman of the finance
committee. Roth sponsored the 1976 law giving unemployed spouses
the right to Individual Retirement Accounts and the 1981 law
letting anyone with a job create an IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with dollars that have
already been taxed, but none of the investment earnings on that
money are subject to taxes; nor are withdrawals. With conventional
IRAs, workers do not pay income taxes on the money they contribute,
but both the contributions and their gains are taxed when the money
is withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Financial institutions reported a rush of activity at the end of
last year as people opened Roth IRAs. But not everyone can
contribute to a Roth IRA, which has income and other restrictions.
Many more people could take advantage of a Roth 401(k) at work,
paying taxes on their contributions but not on any growth in that
money or any withdrawal. In 401(k)s, workers choose how to invest
their money, and employers often match part of their contributions
to encourage participation.
</P>
<P>
   Roth said he wanted to give people more incentives to save and
to expand their savings options.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal would allow workers to increase their savings
substantially in tax-advantaged accounts. The maximum annual
contribution to a Roth 401(k) and a conventional 401(k) plan would
climb to $15,000 from $10,000. Workers age 50 and older would be
allowed to set aside as much as $22,500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The current limit on IRA contributions would rise to $5,000 from
$2,000, and workers 50 and older could set aside up to $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   Most income limits on IRAs would also be eliminated under Roth's
proposal. That means that older workers with high incomes could
save up to $30,000 annually through a combination of 401(k) and IRA
plans, and could use any mix of traditional and Roth plans they
choose.
</P>
<P>
   Roth 401(k) plan funds would have to be withdrawn, beginning at
age 70 1/2, under the same rules as existing 401(k) plans. Roth
IRAs have no such requirements on withdrawals. Rules governing
employer contributions to 401(k) plans would be liberalized to
allow up to $30,000 in matching contributions, now limited to 25
percent of salary.
</P>
<P>
   The Roth 401(k), which would be accompanied by a similar Roth
403(b) plan for government workers and employees of nonprofit
groups, could in its first few years raise government revenues,
which could make it easier to win approval under current
congressional budgeting rules. But there are two serious downsides:
It would cost the government money in the long run and most of the
tax benefits would go to people with higher incomes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Robert McIntyre of Citizens for Tax Justice, a Washington
nonprofit organization that says the tax system favors the rich,
said that ``the middle class will be subsidizing the savings of the
rich'' under Roth's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, McIntyre said, would move the tax system closer to the
plan by Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, to tax all wages at the same rate
and to eliminate taxes on gains and income from investments.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre and two Capitol Hill Democrats who work on tax policy
said they expected the White House to oppose any plan that
increased tax benefits to the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many elements in Roth's proposed Retirement Savings
Opportunity Act of 1999 are a provision to eliminate income limits
for traditional IRAs and for Roth IRAs and to make the rules more
liberal on converting existing accounts to Roth IRAs. Workers could
invest their IRA money in their employers' retirement plans, which
could reduce administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   On traditional corporate pension plans, which are funded and
managed by employers, Roth proposes to allow corporate income tax
deductions for contributions even if plans have 50 percent more
money than they need to pay benefits. That would eliminate most of
the pressure on companies with overfunded plans to reduce the
surplus and preserve their tax deduction.

FOURTH DAY TRADER CLOSED DOWN IN MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the latest crackdown on day-trading companies _
firms that allow individuals to make rapid-fire investments with
personal computers _ Massachusetts securities regulators Thursday
closed down On-Line Investment Services Inc. in Pittsfield,
alleging ``aggregious abuse'' in its operations.
</P>
<P>
   In an administrative complaint, the state securities division
charged On-Line with deceptive marketing, churning an account to
create commissions, and ``engaging in an unlawful scheme to
appropriate 80 percent'' of a customer's profits. On-Line
executives did not return calls to their offices Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Day trading is the latest rage in stock market investing. Using
sophisticated software, individual investors buy and sell stock
with the stroke of a few computer keys, often holding shares for as
little as a minute or two, hoping to profit from miniscule
movements in price. The business has proved highly lucrative to
firms like On-Line, which often provide training seminars in
addition to the software to make trades. The firms also charge
commissions for trades, which are often numerous.
</P>
<P>
   Since last October, the state has taken action against four
day-trading firms, including On-Line.
</P>
<P>
   On-Line, based in Jersey City, N.J., opened the Pittsfield
office in the fall of 1997, the complaint said. The office had only
one account in its Pittsfield office, opened by a 52-year-old
registered nurse related by marriage to On-line's office manager,
Stephen D. Cohen, according to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Because the nurse was an unsophisticated investor, she allowed a
friend of Cohen's to conduct trades for her, the complaint said.
Her monthly statements were sometimes more than 70 pages long,
``reflecting the huge number of transactions.'' In a five-month
period last year, the firm's earned a total of $190,000 in
commissions from trades on her behalf, even though the nurse had
only $39,733 in the account.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cohen also kept 80 percent of any profits the nurse
made as a ``management fee,'' according to the complaint. Cohen
also illegally moved money back and forth from the nurse's account
to an account in the name of Cohen's wife, the complaint alleges.
</P>
<P>
   While day-trade investing has proved profitable for some
investors, Massachusetts securities officials say the industry is
virtually unregulated and ripe for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that day-traders are all bad,'' said Secretary of the
Commonwealth James Galvin, whose office has led a statewide review
of such firms. ``On-line trading is the future of the business. But
there are inherent problems that need to be handled nationally in a
comprehensive way.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Massachusetts and Texas are the only states to take
action against day-trading firms. In Massachusetts, regulators
filed a cease-and desist order against the local office of Block
Trading Inc. in what was believed to be the first action in the
nation against a day trading company. The complaint alleged a
pattern of fraud and an unlawful loan scheme at the company's
Massachusetts office.
</P>
<P>
   The securities division has filed similar orders against the
local offices of Bright Trading Inc., for failing to register with
the securities division, and All-Tech Investment Group, for alleged
abuses ranging from deceptive marketing practices to creating
fictitious accounts and forging custumors' signatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The abuses we've found in day-trading firms suggest a
pervasive problem in the industry,'' said Matt Nester, the
division's chief of enforcement.

SCIENTISTS CONCLUDE PREHUMAN ANCESTORS DINED ON MEAT AND GRASS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., South Africa)(DW) By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Applying a new method of analyzing the chemistry of tooth
enamel, scientists have examined molars of prehuman ancestors who
lived in Africa 3 million years ago and determined that they had
more varied diets than had been supposed. They dined not only on
fruits and leaves, as modern chimpanzees do, but may also already
have become meat eaters.
</P>
<P>
   In a study reported in Friday's issue of the journal Science,
anthropologists said their tests of the carbon content of teeth of
Australopithecus africanus indicate that these individuals ate
large quantities of food rich in carbon 13 _ like grasses and
sedges _ or animals that ate these plants, or both. The findings,
specialists in human evolution said, could modify assumptions about
the behavior and diet of human ancestral species, hominids, before
the emergence about 2.5 million years ago of the lineage that led
to Homo sapiens.
</P>
<P>
   The research indicated that the australopithecines, which walked
upright but also climbed trees, already were venturing out of their
usual forest habitat to forage in open grasslands. It also
suggested that hominids were consuming high-protein animal foods
before the development of stone tools for butchering.
</P>
<P>
   The journal, in a separate article commenting on the research,
noted that many theories of human origins invoke a switch to a
meat-rich diet to explain the sudden expansion of brain size with
the first Homo species. No stone tools have been found associated
with pre-Homo hominids.
</P>
<P>
   The tooth analysis was conducted by Matt Sponheimer, a graduate
student at Rutgers University, working with Dr. Julia A. Lee-Thorp,
a paleoanthropologist at the University of Cape Town in South
Africa. Dr. Lee-Thorp was a pioneer in developing techniques for
sampling tooth enamel for carbon clues to diets of fossil species.
</P>
<P>
   Sponheimer conceded that it was not certain that these
australopithecines were eating meat. But if they were getting the
telltale carbon only from eating grasses, he said, the teeth should
have scratches caused by the wear from silica associated with wild
grasses; they do not. If they were eating meat, it probably came
from small animals that could be caught without tools or the
scavenged remains of meals left by large predators. Another source
could have been grass-eating insects, like grasshoppers, which are
a favorite of today's baboons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever they were doing, they were doing a lot of it,''
Sponheimer said in a telephone interview, referring to the
australopithecines.
</P>
<P>
   One of the four molars tested, he said, contained evidence that
half of the individual's diet consisted of grasses or meat from
grass-eating animals, or a combination of the two. Two others
indicated a 25 percent grass-based diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this is not a case of an occasional taste of a blade of
grass,'' Sponheimer said. ``This is habitual behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Chimpanzees sometimes vary their fruit-and-leaf diets with the
occasional monkey, but monkey meat would not have left the same
carbon signature in the teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Sponheimer said the dietary findings could be clues to a
critical transition in the lives of hominids three million years
ago. Environmental pressures may have started them moving out of
the trees and forests and more and more into open land. In their
survival strategies, A. africanus seem to have been adapting to the
behavior of less-specialized eaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe their hearts and homes were still in the trees,'' he
said, ``but their bellies were tied to the open areas.''

RIGHTS REPORT ON MEXICO SAYS WIDESPREAD ABUSES CONTINUE
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Policemen and soldiers commonly kidnap, torture
and kill people across Mexico, despite government reforms aimed at
eradicating the abuses and despite the authorities' claims that
they have largely ended, Human Rights Watch said in a report issued
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Authorities are more likely to close ranks and deny that even
well-documented abuses ever took place than they are to insist that
those responsible be brought to justice,'' the New York-based
rights organization concluded after a two-year investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors routinely use evidence obtained through torture and
illegal detention, and judges continue to make liberal use of such
tainted evidence rather than rejecting the cases and punishing the
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The abuses occur in all areas of Mexico, not only during
anti-guerrilla campaigns and anti-narcotics drives, but also in
everyday investigations of street crimes, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which in the past has generally rejected such
reports as unwelcome interference in Mexico's internal affairs,
issued an uncharacteristically mild response. The Foreign Ministry
called the report ``extensive'' and said officials would study it.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo has shown some willingness to
recognize that serious human rights violations take place in
Mexico, the group found, but his government ``has not been willing
to recognize the depth of the problem or to systematically promote
the prosecution of state agents responsible for abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Miguel Vivanco, the head of Human Rights Watch Americas,
said Thursday that the organization was ``extremely disappointed''
by a national human rights program Mexico announced in December.
The government did not consult with any nongovernmental human
rights groups or even with its own National Human Rights Commission
before announcing the program, which focuses on human rights
education for Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a public relations operation, let's face it,'' Vivanco
said.
</P>
<P>
   The report details cases of serious abuse in the northern state
of Tamaulipas, which borders Texas, in the southern state of
Oaxaca, where leftist guerrillas are active, and in Morelos, just
south of Mexico City, where the state police authorities were found
to manage a kidnapping ring.

 &HT;    (Bill Maxwell, African American, is an editorial writer and

 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    COURTLAND, Va. _ When Lloyd Allen Applewhite, a successful
peanut farmer, retired 13 years ago at age 62, he knew that he had
many good years left to take farming to another, perhaps more
creative, level. What, he asked himself, would he do after parking
the tractors and pulling off his well-worn coveralls?
 &HT;    His wife, known as ``Lady Doodle'' or just plain ``Doodle,''
knew how he should spend his time. Even though her husband was not
an avid wine drinker and had had very little experience with
grapes, she bought him a $9.99 winemaking kit for Christmas,
figuring that his natural instincts and talents would kick in.
 &HT;    ``He's always been a dedicated, persnickety farmer,'' Doodle
said. ``He spends a lot of time with his grapevines. He is not
sitting around idle, twiddling this thumbs. He loves to grow
things.''
 &HT;    Indeed, he does.
 &HT;    Since planting his first vines, Applewhite, who lives in the
same elegant, white farmhouse where he was born 75 years ago, has
cultivated a reputation for making some of the finest amateur wines
in Virginia. Each year now, his cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay,
riesling and seyval capture awards at American Wine Society
conventions. This year, and for the first time, the state asked him
to be a judge in Virginia's most important wine contest.
 &HT;    With good humor and self-deprecation, the gold and black label
that graces each bottle of Applewhite's wine tells the tale of a
quiet, wonderful success story: Chateau de Applewhite Acres. From
the Vineyards of Lloyd Allen Applewhite. A small, much revered
winery located in the farmlands of Courtland, Virginia. Produced
and bottled at the country estate of Lloyd Allen and Lady Doodle
Applewhite.
 &HT;    But the path to becoming a premier winemaker and judge was
circuitous. ``When I got the $9.99 kit, that was all right, but it
was very unsatisfactory,'' he said. ``It was a plastic jug at that.
Plastic and wine don't go together.''
 &HT;    First, he and Doodle joined a wine tasting group, traveling near
and far _ from Norfolk to Los Angeles and several sites in between.
Then, they joined the American Wine Society after having traveled
to California's famous wine country. From this point, they attended
many seminars. Applewhite learned not only how to ``talk wine'' but
also how to grow grapes and make wine.
 &HT;    From a journal, he ordered his first vines, a French red hybrid
that he planted. After three years, the vines were producing enough
grapes to make several dozen bottles of wine. Applewhite did not
like the taste of the final product and knew that the grapes were
the main culprit. Frustrated, he pulled out these vines and
replaced them with a French white from the vineyard of a friend in
Charlottesville, Va. He has produced some of his best wine from
those vines ever since. All total, he has 60 vines.
 &HT;    Knowing that he had to learn more about the industry, Applewhite
became more involved in the American Wine Society. He traveled to
most parts of the nation, talking, listening, learning and, of
course, tasting. He entered his wines in contests, and his vintages
often performed respectably, winning certificates in the regionals.
But they didn't perform as well in the nationals.
 &HT;    ``It is tough competition, with as many as 500 bottles
entered,'' Applewhite said. ``There's no politics involved. It's
about learning and knowing what you're doing. I learned that one of
my biggest drawbacks was that I had never taken high school or
college chemistry. I am not a chemist and don't pretend to be. But
wine is all about chemistry _ and the soil. I would meet doctors,
college professors and other people who teach chemistry. They are
all good winemakers.''
 &HT;    Applewhite was not and is not intimidated, though.
 &HT;    He studies and practices for hours and has purchased the right
equipment for testing acidity and ``brix,'' or sugar. Because he
intends to remain an amateur and never sell his vintages,
Applewhite does not invest in machinery and materials he does not
need.
 &HT;    ``For example, most of the wineries ferment their grapes in oak
barrels,'' he said. ``I don't have oak barrels, so I use 5-gallon
glass jugs. I can take oak strips and put them in there if I want
to make it dry.''
 &HT;    This year, Applewhite expects to produce between 250 to 300
bottles, his best yield yet. His is basically a one-man operation.
The hardest and most time-consuming chore is growing the grapes,
which involves, among other things, careful pruning and spraying.
 &HT;    His real joy, of course, comes when taking a perfectly corked
bottle from his cellar, a converted barn that is kept at 65 degrees
year-round, and sharing his handiwork with friends. ``You make a
lot of friends when you make wine,'' he said, smiling. ``Wine
doesn't always give you a headache. Most of the time, it makes you
cheerful. It's a great hobby.''

 &HT;    (Tim Giago, Lakota Indian, is publisher and editor-in-chief of
Indian Country Today. His Indian name is Nanwica Kciji.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``Why don't you Indians just forget the past and get on with
tomorrow. After all, this is 1999, not 1899.'' That is one of the
most frequently asked questions I receive.
 &HT;    Let me try to answer. Suppose a man or woman has a piece of land
tied up in litigation with the state and federal governments or by
mining interests or private individuals. Perhaps the land is in
legal jeopardy because of the many laws regulating lands held in
trust. Suppose that land has been contaminated by mining companies
or by radioactive tailings left over from uranium mining.
 &HT;    Or perhaps, because of survey errors, a portion of the land is
claimed by another party even though it was within the original
boundaries claimed by the individual.
 &HT;    Maybe there is a question of water rights, mineral rights,
Igrazing rights. Or maybe the land is claimed by another because it
was taxed illegally. What if there was a question of who owned the
river running through the land?
 &HT;    Then there is a recurring question of jurisdiction. Who has the
legal rights of law enforcement? What court has jurisdiction over
criminal acts committed on the land?
 &HT;    There is a school on the land. Does the state have jurisdiction
over the school or the school board? What about the curriculum? Can
the state or the federal government levy taxes on the land?
 &HT;    These are only a few of the many situations confronting
individual Indian tribal members and tribal governments. Court
cases dating back as far as 1921 are still being litigated.
Millions of acres of land and millions of dollars in natural
resources are under legal challenge by tribes and courts.
 &HT;    Where, when and how tribes will construct casinos is under close
scrutiny by state and federal courts. In California the tribes had
to get a measure (Proposition 5) on the election ballot in order to
challenge the ruling by Gov. Pete Wilson and his legislative body
that Indian gaming was illegal. Their initiative won.
 &HT;    The point here is that it is impossible for most Indian
individuals and tribal governments to say they will end all
confrontations _ legal and otherwise _ that impact their daily
lives and just roll over and be good Indians.
 &HT;    It seems that in this day and age ``the only good Indian is a
fake Indian.'' That's short for mascot. College and high school
alumni just love their fake Indians, but confront them with real
Indians and their love suddenly turns to hate.
 &HT;    It is not a question of forgetting the past and getting on with
tomorrow. There are far too many loose ends that must be tied up
before this can happen.
 &HT;    The people of the Indian nations are still looking for justice.
In the 500 years since the coming of Columbus the indigenous people
of the Western Hemisphere have not found justice. How can they
suddenly forget all of that and move into a new tomorrow until all
of the legal issues impacting them every day of their lives are
resolved?
 &HT;    Unless you know the full extent of the issues, please do not be
so superior as to tell us to forget the past and get on with
tomorrow. To us, the past is now.
 &HT;    We have been involved in the struggle for justice and equal
rights for 400 years. We remain under constant attack from the far
right and from those who would covet what little we have left.
 &HT;    The ignorance of who we are, what we are and what we want out of
life is one of the major black holes in America. It is so easy for
someone with a superior attitude to expect that we all want what
they want. Having never walked in our moccasins they have no idea
what America means or doesn't mean to us.
 &HT;    There are Indians who have been totally assimilated into the
mainstream. Please do not use them as role models for the rest of
us. There are no easy solutions to the problems that date back 500
years.
 &HT;    And please, for heaven's sake, do not believe you can step in
and solve these problems for us. The Indian people are long past
this form of paternalism. We will solve our problems ourselves and
we will do it within the legal confines laid down by the crafters
of the U.S. Constitution.
 &HT;    You can offer us a hand, however. And we'll gladly accept it.
 &HT;    But the final decisions will rest with the Indian people
themselves.

tied up in litigation with the state and federal governments or by
mining interests or private individuals. Perhaps the land is in
legal jeopardy because of the many laws regulating lands held in
trust. Suppose that land has been contaminated by mining companies
or by radioactive tailings left over from uranium mining.
 &HT;    Or perhaps, because of survey errors, a portion of the land is
claimed by another party even though it was within the original
boundaries claimed by the individual.
 &HT;    Maybe there is a question of water rights, mineral rights,
Igrazing rights. Or maybe the land is claimed by another because it
was taxed illegally. What if there was a question of who owned the
river running through the land?
 &HT;    Then there is a recurring question of jurisdiction. Who has the
legal rights of law enforcement? What court has jurisdiction over
criminal acts committed on the land?
 &HT;    There is a school on the land. Does the state have jurisdiction
over the school or the school board? What about the curriculum? Can
the state or the federal government levy taxes on the land?
 &HT;    These are only a few of the many situations confronting
individual Indian tribal members and tribal governments. Court
cases dating back as far as 1921 are still being litigated.
Millions of acres of land and millions of dollars in natural
resources are under legal challenge by tribes and courts.
 &HT;    Where, when and how tribes will construct casinos is under close
scrutiny by state and federal courts. In California the tribes had
to get a measure (Proposition 5) on the election ballot in order to
challenge the ruling by Gov. Pete Wilson and his legislative body
that Indian gaming was illegal. Their initiative won.
 &HT;    The point here is that it is impossible for most Indian
individuals and tribal governments to say they will end all
confrontations _ legal and otherwise _ that impact their daily
lives and just roll over and be good Indians.
 &HT;    It seems that in this day and age ``the only good Indian is a
fake Indian.'' That's short for mascot. College and high school
alumni just love their fake Indians, but confront them with real
Indians and their love suddenly turns to hate.
 &HT;    It is not a question of forgetting the past and getting on with
tomorrow. There are far too many loose ends that must be tied up
before this can happen.
 &HT;    The people of the Indian nations are still looking for justice.
In the 500 years since the coming of Columbus the indigenous people
of the Western Hemisphere have not found justice. How can they
suddenly forget all of that and move into a new tomorrow until all
of the legal issues impacting them every day of their lives are
resolved?
 &HT;    Unless you know the full extent of the issues, please do not be
so superior as to tell us to forget the past and get on with
tomorrow. To us, the past is now.
 &HT;    We have been involved in the struggle for justice and equal
rights for 400 years. We remain under constant attack from the far
right and from those who would covet what little we have left.
 &HT;    The ignorance of who we are, what we are and what we want out of
life is one of the major black holes in America. It is so easy for
someone with a superior attitude to expect that we all want what
they want. Having never walked in our moccasins they have no idea
what America means or doesn't mean to us.
 &HT;    There are Indians who have been totally assimilated into the
mainstream. Please do not use them as role models for the rest of
us. There are no easy solutions to the problems that date back 500
years.
 &HT;    And please, for heaven's sake, do not believe you can step in
and solve these problems for us. The Indian people are long past
this form of paternalism. We will solve our problems ourselves and
we will do it within the legal confines laid down by the crafters
of the U.S. Constitution.
 &HT;    You can offer us a hand, however. And we'll gladly accept it.
 &HT;    But the final decisions will rest with the Indian people
themselves.

 By KIRSTEN CHAPMAN 
 &HT;    (Kirsten Chapman writes a weekly column for the Columbus
Dispatch in Columbus, Ohio, and is the author of three books,
including recently published ``The Way Home,'' available on the
internet at www.chapmanthewayhome.com) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``There is one column that I hope you never have to write,''
began the woman from Danville, Ohio ``and it concerns the death of
a husband.''
 &HT;    Her riveting letter was written on the eve of her summer trip to
Scandinavia, planned months before.
 &HT;    ``I met Paul when I was 18 and home for spring break from
college. He bowled with my father and was 12 years older than I.
Looking back, I think, `At 18, what did I know?' but I did. We were
married when I was barely 20 and he 32.''
 &HT;    She had five children in seven years, she said, and spent her
life as a wife and mother.
 &HT;    ``All at once, I am 60. ... I am busy. But the joy has gone from
my heart. ... I have people who care about me, but I do not have
the one thing that drove me both crazy and happy for 42 years of
life. Time is the great healer, I know, but time does turn
slowly.''
 &HT;    Before signing her name, she wrote what losing her husband had
taught her most of all: the truth of an adage.
 &HT;    ``My advice for everyone now: Don't get crazy about the little
things, and they are all little things,'' she said. ``This is one
of those lessons that always comes too late.''
 &HT;    She had grasped, before the rest of us, what a friend's mother
discovered at her moment of death. With her son at her side, the
woman said, ``What fools we are,'' then closed her eyes.
 &HT;    We can read into her last remark whatever we imagine. Perhaps,
an acquaintance said, her first glimpse of the afterlife was better
_ or worse _ than she'd pictured.
 &HT;    I choose a more earthly interpretation of her words _ that we
foolishly waste time all the time, fretting over the unimportant,
instead of celebrating our lives and those of others.
 &HT;    Frankly, we miss the miracle.
 &HT;    ``Our life is frittered away by detail,'' Thoreau warned.
``Simplify, simplify.''
 &HT;    But we must be careful how we simplify.
 &HT;    ``In his old age, Charles Darwin lamented that his mind had
become a sort of sausage machine for grinding factual observations
into scientific systems,'' Clyde S. Kilby says in the foreword of
``Listen To the Green.'' ``He said that had he been able to live
his life over again he would have frequently read poetry and
listened to music because `the loss of these tastes is a loss of
happiness, and may possibly be injurious to the intellect, and more
probably, to the moral character.'''
 &HT;    William Maxwell _ the author of 12 books, including six novels _
contemplated in the essay ``Nearing 90'':
 &HT;    ``Before I am ready to call it quits, I would like to reread
every book I've ever deeply enjoyed, beginning with Jane Austen.
... until I arrive at ... William Butler Yeats. ... I would read
all day long and well into the night if there were no other claims
on my time.''
 &HT;    ``Every now and then ... and especially when I am in the
country, I stand and look hard at everything.''
 &HT;    How to climb above the details of the small stuff and rise to
contemplate, and understand, the meaning of life?
 &HT;    George Herbert was wise enough to figure out in the l7th century
that ``life is half spent before we know what it is.''
 &HT;    Many of us never know, yet mourn the chances we've squandered.
 &HT;    ``I don't think I regret a single `excess' of my responsive
youth,'' Henry James confided in a letter to Hugh Walpole in 1913.
``I only regret, in my chilled age, certain occasions and
possibilities I didn't embrace.''
 &HT;    The letter from Danville affirms life.
 &HT;    The writer resembles a modern Montaigne who, centuries earlier,
cautioned:
 &HT;    ``Living is not measured by length, but by use; some ... have
lived long, and lived little; attend to it while you are in it. It
lies in your will, not in the number of years, for you to have
lived enough.''

 By CHUCK COLBERT 
 &HT;    (Chuck Colbert is a founder of the Gay and Lesbian Alumni of
Notre Dame/St. Mary's College, and serves on the board of directors
of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``If procreation is essential to marriage, then why doesn't
Patrick Buchanan have any children?''
 &HT;    That's one question _ posed several years ago by Andrew
Sullivan, a gay political journalist _ that did not come up in the
Vermont Supreme Court several weeks ago.
 &HT;    Still, procreation featured front and center as five state
supreme court justices heard oral arguments in Baker vs. Vermont, a
lawsuit challenging the state's refusal to grant marriage licenses
to same-sex couples.
 &HT;    With the defeat of same-sex marriage ballot initiatives in
Hawaii and Alaska on Nov. 3, Vermont represents the latest and best
chance advocates of same-sex marriage have in the ongoing struggle
for equal marriage rights and responsibilities.
 &HT;    ``If marriage licenses are only for couples who can procreate,
asked Vermont Supreme Court Justice James Morse, what happens in
the not-too-distant future when same-sex couples will be able to
use advances in medical research to create their own child? Since
the state is arguing today that the ability of heterosexual couples
to procreate makes it necessary for the state to regulate their
relationships through licenses, will the state be arguing tomorrow
the same for same-sex relationships?'' reported Lisa Keen in The
Washington Blade.
 &HT;    The state of Vermont is essentially arguing that marriage, by
definition, is a union between one man and one woman. Underpinning
that definition is the state's wish to link sexual intercourse with
procreation and child rearing.
 &HT;    The case of Baker vs. Vermont began in 1997 when two lesbian
couples and a gay male couple filed suit against the state and
towns that denied them marriage licenses. A superior court judge
dismissed the case, and the plaintiffs appealed to the state's
supreme court.
 &HT;    ``The state has an interest in supporting marriage and
protecting it from potentially destabilizing changes,'' said Eve
Jacobs-Carnahan, assistant attorney general for the state of
Vermont, in a New York Times article.
 &HT;    Lawyers for the six plaintiffs challenging Vermont's ban on same
sex marriages _ two lesbian couples and one gay male couple _ say
that the state's marriage laws are ``to protect, encourage, and
support unions of committed couples, and thereby also provide a
stable environment for those couples to raise children, if they
have them,'' according to a Boston Globe news story.
 &HT;    One of the lesbian couples, Lois Franham and Holly Puterbaugh,
are already parents, having adopted a daughter.
 &HT;    Ironically, the state of Vermont was the first in the country to
allow second-parent adoption by gay and lesbian couples. So a
lesbian couple, like Franham and Puterbaugh, can be the legal
parents of the same child; but they are denied the right to marry
and along with that denial are hundreds of benefits, including
joint insurance policies for home, auto, and health; inheritance of
real and personal property through right of survivorship;
annuities, pension plans, social security, and Medicare.
 &HT;    The political climate in Vermont, however, bodes well for the
state to be the first in the land to permit same-sex marriage.
There are no sodomy laws. The state prohibits discrimination based
on sexual orientation in housing, employment, public accommodation,
and credit. The Vermont hate crimes law includes penalties for
anti-gay violence. The state government offers domestic partnership
benefits to employees, and so do some cities and towns.
 &HT;    The legal climate seems favorable as well. Harvard Law School
Professor Lawrence Tribe says there's a ``good chance'' the Vermont
Supreme Court will agree with the plaintiffs' arguments in favor of
same-sex marriage.
 &HT;    In a Boston Globe article Tribe called the procreation argument
``insane,'' adding ``There is no polite way of characterizing that
(procreation argument).'' It ``means that sterile people shouldn't
be able to marry, that two octogenarians should not be able to
marry. It's ridiculous,'' he said.
 &HT;    Vermont ``doesn't ask straight couples about procreative intent
or ability,'' said Beth Robinson, a lawyer representing the
plaintiffs.
 &HT;    But what if the standard of procreative intent and ability
applied to couples like Shelley and Pat Buchanan _ married
straights who do not have children?
 &HT;    ``From the public absence of his children ... '' writes Andrew
Sullivan in a 1996 New Republic article, ``I can infer certain
things about Buchanan's `lifestyle.' Either Buchanan (a Roman
Catholic) is using contraception, in which case he is a hypocrite;
or he or his wife is infertile, and he is, one assumes, engaging in
non-procreative sex.''
 &HT;    In any event, that behavior doesn't make the Buchanan's marriage
_ or any other marriage without children _ any less valid or
meaningful. But the reality of non-procreative sex among married
heterosexual couples ought to cause people who object to same-sex
marriage _ because of non-procreation _ to rethink their position.
They just may have more in common with the proponents of the idea
than with its critics.

 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``If procreation is essential to marriage, then why doesn't
Patrick Buchanan have any children?''
 &HT;    That's one question _ posed several years ago by Andrew
Sullivan, a gay political journalist _ that did not come up in the
Vermont Supreme Court several weeks ago.
 &HT;    Still, procreation featured front and center as five state
supreme court justices heard oral arguments in Baker vs. Vermont, a
lawsuit challenging the state's refusal to grant marriage licenses
to same-sex couples.
 &HT;    With the defeat of same-sex marriage ballot initiatives in
Hawaii and Alaska on Nov. 3, Vermont represents the latest and best
chance advocates of same-sex marriage have in the ongoing struggle
for equal marriage rights and responsibilities.
 &HT;    ``If marriage licenses are only for couples who can procreate,
asked Vermont Supreme Court Justice James Morse, what happens in
the not-too-distant future when same-sex couples will be able to
use advances in medical research to create their own child? Since
the state is arguing today that the ability of heterosexual couples
to procreate makes it necessary for the state to regulate their
relationships through licenses, will the state be arguing tomorrow
the same for same-sex relationships?'' reported Lisa Keen in The
Washington Blade.
 &HT;    The state of Vermont is essentially arguing that marriage, by
definition, is a union between one man and one woman. Underpinning
that definition is the state's wish to link sexual intercourse with
procreation and child rearing.
 &HT;    The case of Baker vs. Vermont began in 1997 when two lesbian
couples and a gay male couple filed suit against the state and
towns that denied them marriage licenses. A superior court judge
dismissed the case, and the plaintiffs appealed to the state's
supreme court.
 &HT;    ``The state has an interest in supporting marriage and
protecting it from potentially destabilizing changes,'' said Eve
Jacobs-Carnahan, assistant attorney general for the state of
Vermont, in a New York Times article.
 &HT;    Lawyers for the six plaintiffs challenging Vermont's ban on same
sex marriages _ two lesbian couples and one gay male couple _ say
that the state's marriage laws are ``to protect, encourage, and
support unions of committed couples, and thereby also provide a
stable environment for those couples to raise children, if they
have them,'' according to a Boston Globe news story.
 &HT;    One of the lesbian couples, Lois Franham and Holly Puterbaugh,
are already parents, having adopted a daughter.
 &HT;    Ironically, the state of Vermont was the first in the country to
allow second-parent adoption by gay and lesbian couples. So a
lesbian couple, like Franham and Puterbaugh, can be the legal
parents of the same child; but they are denied the right to marry
and along with that denial are hundreds of benefits, including
joint insurance policies for home, auto, and health; inheritance of
real and personal property through right of survivorship;
annuities, pension plans, social security, and Medicare.
 &HT;    The political climate in Vermont, however, bodes well for the
state to be the first in the land to permit same-sex marriage.
There are no sodomy laws. The state prohibits discrimination based
on sexual orientation in housing, employment, public accommodation,
and credit. The Vermont hate crimes law includes penalties for
anti-gay violence. The state government offers domestic partnership
benefits to employees, and so do some cities and towns.
 &HT;    The legal climate seems favorable as well. Harvard Law School
Professor Lawrence Tribe says there's a ``good chance'' the Vermont
Supreme Court will agree with the plaintiffs' arguments in favor of
same-sex marriage.
 &HT;    In a Boston Globe article Tribe called the procreation argument
``insane,'' adding ``There is no polite way of characterizing that

be able to marry, that two octogenarians should not be able to

 c. 1999 Hispanic Business 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    What a difference nine years can make.
 &HT;    In 1989, amid a bruising area housing slump _ and mindful of the
chilly reception that had met the grand designs of other
foreign-born entrepreneurs _ Carlos Sol's friends cautioned him
against leaving his job as a Richmond, Virginia, construction
manager and striking out on his own.
 &HT;    Sol was no entrepreneurial tyro, though. He had launched a home
design firm in New Orleans four years earlier, only to see it
derailed by regional economic vagaries barely a year later. He knew
first hand about the risks of business start-ups.
 &HT;    Sol also understood that optimal market conditions and timing
are the fanciful notions of would-be entrepreneurs who have trouble
acting on their ideas. And so, he ignored his friends' advice and
founded a new home-design company, DelSol Inc.
 &HT;    Today, his growing circle of supporters and clients is pleased
he did _ a group sure to become even less exclusive now that Sol
has been named the 1998 Hispanic Business Entrepreneur of the Year.
The annual competition was sponsored this year by IBM, the
Principal Financial Group, and Glendale Federal Bank.
 &HT;    ``It's very important to emphasize that to be successful in the
United States you need to learn the rules,'' said Sol, a native of
El Salvador, who immigrated with his wife, Patricia, to the United
States in 1982.
 &HT;    ``The language, of course, is very important, but also the way
of doing business, maintaining your honesty. However, I would also
stress the value of keeping in touch with your traditions, your
culture. You can and should do both.''
 &HT;    Whatever his business philosophy, there's no arguing with
DelSol's balance sheet. The company is on track to gross about $4
million this year, a sizable leap over last year's $3.4 million.
The numbers are still more impressive in the context of 1995's
gross, which totaled about $500,000.
 &HT;    DelSol specializes in custom home design and construction on a
grand scale. Projects average 5,000 square feet, and prices, which
are escalating rapidly, range from $400,000 to $1 million.
 &HT;    The demand for such upscale property has surprised even Sol. In
fact, business has been so brisk he has had to turn people away.
DelSol declined to take on three home projects last year and has
turned down another two so far in 1998. Intent on retaining its
services, one customer has been waiting on the firm for more than
six months.
 &HT;    Indeed, DelSol's reputation has become such a force in the
community that the company budgets no money for advertising; all
its business is generated by word of mouth. Receiving a ``Gold
Award'' from the Home Builders Association of Richmond in 1994
hasn't hurt matters, either.
 &HT;    Things didn't always click into place so effortlessly. The Sols
relocated to Richmond in 1986, after watching Carlos' first design
and construction venture, Architectural Construction, become a
casualty of New Orleans' depressed mid-'80s housing market. In
Richmond, he landed a job as a construction manager with
homebuilding firm The Virginia Group, where he made good use of the
civil engineering training he had received in El Salvador.
 &HT;    For the next three years he built homes _ and a valuable rapport
with local residents _ before again deciding to test the
entrepreneurial waters. He had already begun subcontracting as a
designer for The Virginia Group on the side, so the groundwork had
been laid. There was just one problem: His friends didn't think he
had a chance.
 &HT;    ``Richmond is very traditional and it can be hard for foreigners
to break in, particularly to start their own businesses. People
tend to look at newcomers a certain way and are slow to see them in
a different light _ as a business owner, for instance,'' says Sol.
 &HT;    ``My friends reminded me of these things, and business was
pretty slow at the time. But there is no perfect time to start your
own company, so I went ahead and did it.''
 &HT;    Initially conceived as a company specializing exclusively in
custom home design, DelSol began modestly enough. Carlos, and later
his wife, worked from their dining room table. Both had also
studied architecture in Guatemala before coming to the states, and
as it had in New Orleans, a home design firm seemed like a natural
fit.
 &HT;    As luck would have it though, DelSol's first client was Reynolds
Metal Co. executive Jack Kelzer, who, learning of Sol's background,
gave him free reign to design and build his new home.
 &HT;    ``At first, I didn't want to do it, only because I had a certain
idea of what my company would be, namely a design firm. But he kept
saying, `Just build it, Carlos,' and I was finally convinced. I had
always liked construction anyway, so I guess it made sense,''
recalls Sol.
 &HT;    So began a fruitful relationship. Kelzer was ultimately so
pleased with the results that he gave Carlos and Patricia Caribbean
cruise tickets. And, as word spread, other well-to-do executives at
Reynolds and elsewhere began to seek out DelSol's services.
 &HT;    Most significantly, that first project enabled Sol to begin
developing a signature design style _ one that has since matured
into a distinctive amalgam of Spanish arches and more traditional
architectural elements.
 &HT;    ``People in Richmond weren't used to arches. Many are of German
or English decent, so they tend to like Tudor-style homes. I think
some people might worry that I'm trying to impose my Spanish ways
on them, so I don't emphasize the origins of the some of the design
things I include. Customers always seem to like the way it looks,
though. My goal is to create something beautiful without
labeling,'' Sol explains.
 &HT;    His latest design touch: rounded interior corners, a look he
first saw in Las Vegas. He says clients are increasingly requesting
it.
 &HT;    DelSol averages just five homes a year, in part because of the
size and nature of individual projects, but also because Sol prides
himself on being involved in all facets of the design and building
processes _ in close consultation with clients.
 &HT;    ``Our emphasis is on quality and so you sometimes have to
sacrifice on quantity,'' he says.
 &HT;    To keep a lid on expenses and minimize labor problems, the
company employs a small staff and relies extensively on
subcontractors, though it recently added an in-house engineer and
carpentry crew for a planned foray into custom commercial design.
DelSol is in the process of building a lavish new office area,
which the firm hopes to complete and occupy by mid next year.
 &HT;    For all his success, Sol is perhaps most proud of the fact that
he has been able to achieve it in the United States. He taught
himself English and has little patience for those disinclined to
make a similar effort. He says the challenge confronting immigrants
driven to succeed is embracing the American way of conducting
business without sacrificing their cultural identity _ a lesson he
takes pains to impart to his two children.
 &HT;    ``You have to know when to wear your sombrero and when to wear
your baseball cap,'' he says.

 &HT;    In 1989, amid a bruising area housing slump _ and mindful of the
chilly reception that had met the grand designs of other
foreign-born entrepreneurs _ Carlos Sol's friends cautioned him
against leaving his job as a Richmond, Virginia, construction
manager and striking out on his own.
 &HT;    Sol was no entrepreneurial tyro, though. He had launched a home
design firm in New Orleans four years earlier, only to see it
derailed by regional economic vagaries barely a year later. He knew
first hand about the risks of business start-ups.
 &HT;    Sol also understood that optimal market conditions and timing
are the fanciful notions of would-be entrepreneurs who have trouble
acting on their ideas. And so, he ignored his friends' advice and
founded a new home-design company, DelSol Inc.
 &HT;    Today, his growing circle of supporters and clients is pleased
he did _ a group sure to become even less exclusive now that Sol
has been named the 1998 Hispanic Business Entrepreneur of the Year.
The annual competition was sponsored this year by IBM, the
Principal Financial Group, and Glendale Federal Bank.
 &HT;    ``It's very important to emphasize that to be successful in the
United States you need to learn the rules,'' said Sol, a native of
El Salvador, who immigrated with his wife, Patricia, to the United
States in 1982.
 &HT;    ``The language, of course, is very important, but also the way
of doing business, maintaining your honesty. However, I would also
stress the value of keeping in touch with your traditions, your
culture. You can and should do both.''
 &HT;    Whatever his business philosophy, there's no arguing with
DelSol's balance sheet. The company is on track to gross about $4
million this year, a sizable leap over last year's $3.4 million.
The numbers are still more impressive in the context of 1995's
gross, which totaled about $500,000.
 &HT;    DelSol specializes in custom home design and construction on a
grand scale. Projects average 5,000 square feet, and prices, which
are escalating rapidly, range from $400,000 to $1 million.
 &HT;    The demand for such upscale property has surprised even Sol. In
fact, business has been so brisk he has had to turn people away.
DelSol declined to take on three home projects last year and has
turned down another two so far in 1998. Intent on retaining its
services, one customer has been waiting on the firm for more than
six months.
 &HT;    Indeed, DelSol's reputation has become such a force in the
community that the company budgets no money for advertising; all
its business is generated by word of mouth. Receiving a ``Gold
Award'' from the Home Builders Association of Richmond in 1994
hasn't hurt matters, either.
 &HT;    Things didn't always click into place so effortlessly. The Sols
relocated to Richmond in 1986, after watching Carlos' first design
and construction venture, Architectural Construction, become a
casualty of New Orleans' depressed mid-'80s housing market. In
Richmond, he landed a job as a construction manager with
homebuilding firm The Virginia Group, where he made good use of the
civil engineering training he had received in El Salvador.
 &HT;    For the next three years he built homes _ and a valuable rapport
with local residents _ before again deciding to test the
entrepreneurial waters. He had already begun subcontracting as a
designer for The Virginia Group on the side, so the groundwork had
been laid. There was just one problem: His friends didn't think he
had a chance.
 &HT;    ``Richmond is very traditional and it can be hard for foreigners
to break in, particularly to start their own businesses. People
tend to look at newcomers a certain way and are slow to see them in
a different light _ as a business owner, for instance,'' says Sol.
 &HT;    ``My friends reminded me of these things, and business was
pretty slow at the time. But there is no perfect time to start your
own company, so I went ahead and did it.''
 &HT;    Initially conceived as a company specializing exclusively in
custom home design, DelSol began modestly enough. Carlos, and later
his wife, worked from their dining room table. Both had also
studied architecture in Guatemala before coming to the states, and
as it had in New Orleans, a home design firm seemed like a natural
fit.
 &HT;    As luck would have it though, DelSol's first client was Reynolds
Metal Co. executive Jack Kelzer, who, learning of Sol's background,
gave him free reign to design and build his new home.
 &HT;    ``At first, I didn't want to do it, only because I had a certain
idea of what my company would be, namely a design firm. But he kept
saying, `Just build it, Carlos,' and I was finally convinced. I had
always liked construction anyway, so I guess it made sense,''
recalls Sol.
 &HT;    So began a fruitful relationship. Kelzer was ultimately so
pleased with the results that he gave Carlos and Patricia Caribbean
cruise tickets. And, as word spread, other well-to-do executives at
Reynolds and elsewhere began to seek out DelSol's services.
 &HT;    Most significantly, that first project enabled Sol to begin
developing a signature design style _ one that has since matured
into a distinctive amalgam of Spanish arches and more traditional
architectural elements.
 &HT;    ``People in Richmond weren't used to arches. Many are of German
or English decent, so they tend to like Tudor-style homes. I think
some people might worry that I'm trying to impose my Spanish ways
on them, so I don't emphasize the origins of the some of the design
things I include. Customers always seem to like the way it looks,
though. My goal is to create something beautiful without
labeling,'' Sol explains.
 &HT;    His latest design touch: rounded interior corners, a look he
first saw in Las Vegas. He says clients are increasingly requesting
it.
 &HT;    DelSol averages just five homes a year, in part because of the
size and nature of individual projects, but also because Sol prides
himself on being involved in all facets of the design and building
processes _ in close consultation with clients.
 &HT;    ``Our emphasis is on quality and so you sometimes have to
sacrifice on quantity,'' he says.
 &HT;    To keep a lid on expenses and minimize labor problems, the
company employs a small staff and relies extensively on
subcontractors, though it recently added an in-house engineer and
carpentry crew for a planned foray into custom commercial design.
DelSol is in the process of building a lavish new office area,
which the firm hopes to complete and occupy by mid next year.
 &HT;    For all his success, Sol is perhaps most proud of the fact that
he has been able to achieve it in the United States. He taught
himself English and has little patience for those disinclined to
make a similar effort. He says the challenge confronting immigrants
driven to succeed is embracing the American way of conducting
business without sacrificing their cultural identity _ a lesson he
takes pains to impart to his two children.
 &HT;    ``You have to know when to wear your sombrero and when to wear
your baseball cap,'' he says.

   THE VINTNER OF CHATEAU DE APPLEWHITE ACRES. When Lloyd Allen
Applewhite retired 13 years ago from peanut farming at age 62, he
knew he had many good years left to take farming to another,
perhaps more creative, level. And via a circuitous route, he
arrived at winemaking, reports writer Bill Maxwell. This year, his
one-man operation expects to produce between 250 to 300 bottles,
Applewhite's best yield yet, and his wines now capture awards at
American Wine Society conventions. But his real joy comes when
taking a perfect bottle from his cellar and sharing his handiwork
with friends. ``You make a lot of friends when you make wine,'' he
told Maxwell, with a smile.

   FORGET THE PAST? TO INDIANS, THE PAST IS NOW. ``Why don't you
Indians just forget the past and get on with tomorrow. After all,
this is 1999, not 1899,'' columnist Tim Giago often hears. But
there are many situations from the past confronting individual
Indian tribal members and tribal governments today, he writes.
Court cases dating back as far as 1921 are still being litigated.
Millions of acres of land and millions of dollars in natural
resources are under legal challenge by tribes and courts. ``It is
not a question of forgetting the past and getting on with
tomorrow,'' Giago stresses. ``There are far too many loose ends
that must be tied up before this can happen.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House managers' arguments to the Senate on
Thursday, on one level, were about what the evidence against
President Clinton already showed, but the strong subtext was that
they could not win their case without more evidence, from live
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   As they laced their opening arguments with colored charts,
videotape, a litany of facts and a studied deference to the upper
chamber, they were also fighting to keep a majority of the Senate
from repudiating the whole House impeachment process by voting
later this month to end the trial abruptly or to disallow
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed two of the House managers spoke in almost identical
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``So who is telling the truth?'' one of them, James Rogan,
R-Calif., asked rhetorically. ``The only way to really know,'' he
responded, ``is to bring forth the witnesses, put them under oath,
and give each juror, each member of this body, the opportunity to
make that determination of credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The other, Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., posed two questions: ``Can
you convict the president of the United States without hearing
personally the testimony of one of the key witnesses?'' and ``Can
you dismiss the charges under this strong sense of facts and
circumstances without hearing and evaluating the credibility of
witnesses?''
</P>
<P>
   Their determined message emphasized how _ despite the day's
judicial air, reinforced by the presence in the Senate chamber of
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist in his black robe _ the
impeachment trial of the president was not a straightforward legal
proceeding that would necessarily move automatically to the
standard calling of witnesses and cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is this a jury quite like any other. Far from being
sequestered from the passions of the day, these are 100 senators
well aware of public impatience with the Monica Lewinsky case. Just
this week, in fact, Senate Republicans sat in a closed-door meeting
examining polling data that showed that a majority of voters
opposed Clinton's impeachment and that the approval ratings of the
Republican Party had sunk in the wake of the House's impeachment
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the data underscored the fact that some senators _
particularly those up for election in 2000 _ were likely to
consider not only the facts of the case but how their votes would
affect their own personal political survival. And no matter where
they stood on the president's fate, many senators across party
lines were desperate to maintain the dignity of their chamber and
to keep impeachment from propelling them into the same kind of
fierce partisanship that, they say, sullied the House.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of this difficult political environment, House Republicans
had as their primary goal Thursday to win a back-to-back series of
Senate votes set for the week of Jan. 24 _ one on whether to
adjourn the case after opening arguments and one on whether to
allow the deposition of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   While they are thought to have only a long shot at best at
assembling the 67 votes needed to remove Clinton from office, they
believe their chances are improved if a parade of witnesses can
either sway the country or cause more senators to take a second
look at the charges that the president obstructed justice and
committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   After he finished on the Senate floor, Rogan told reporters in a
hallway, ``I just don't see how the case can be presented without
witnesses. Noting that Clinton had denied every allegation against
him, Rogan said, ``This isn't something where we can just pull up a
cold record and make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the head of the 13
member prosecution team set the tone for the day by opening the
House case with a deference for the Senate at odds with the
acrimony that had been flying back and forth between the two
chambers in recent weeks. ``We want you to know how much we respect
you and this institution,'' he said, ``and how grateful we are for
your guidance and cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Then for hours, dispassionately stitching together a chronology
of events, pointing to cross-referenced time lines and avoiding any
courtroom theatrics, four more House Republicans built their best
case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   It was a case they said that showed that Clinton's denials that
he had committed perjury or obstructed justice ``strained all
boundaries of common sense.'' And the presentations were
deliberately exhaustive in hopes of convincing senators that they
simply could not vote just to dismiss the impeachment case out of
hand.
</P>
<P>
   The facts were not new and the arguments were largely the same
ones that had been made by David Schippers, the Republicans' chief
investigative counsel, before the House Judiciary Committee just a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally the tones were scathing as when Rogan spoke of
Clinton's ``ludicrous definitions of ordinary words and phrases''
or when Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., used language reminiscent
of the Nixon era when he said that failure to convict Clinton,
would ``cause a cancer to be present in our society for
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, aware that they wanted to win over some
Democrats, not anger them, the Republicans stripped their case of
Schippers' tones of open contempt and sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   So far, with the two parties still feuding bitterly over
witnesses, no one yet knows how the Senate will answer the House's
call for a cast of witnesses beginning with Ms. Lewinsky. Sen. Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska, said he had now been persuaded to vote for
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But even Stevens had no doubt that the ultimate case against the
president was unlikely ever to succeed. ``I think too many minds
are made up already,'' he said. ``I don't think you'll see it
change.''

WASHINGTON STATE HAS FEWEST ABORTION RIGHTS RESTRICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Washington state has the fewest restrictions on
abortion rights of any state in the nation, according to a national
study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights
Action League, found that over the past six years, legislatures
around the country have passed an increasing number of laws that
make it more difficult for women to end pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington state has turned back repeated efforts by
anti-abortion lawmakers and initiative proponents to limit abortion
rights, and has emerged as the most abortion-rights friendly state
in the nation, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when a patchwork of laws make it increasingly more
difficult for women to access abortion services nationwide,
Washington state has gone in the opposite direction,'' said NARAL
President Kate Michelman. ``Washington is the state that most fully
protects a woman's right to choose. It is a model of protection,
and a model of government restraint in an area where government
should not be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The few restrictions on abortion rights in Washington state do
not seem to have led to a particularly high abortion rate. In 1996,
there were 21 abortions per 1,000 women of childbearing age in
Washington state, compared to 23 abortions per 1,000 nationwide,
according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a research group in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   After dropping for several years, the abortion rate in
Washington rose slightly in 1997, to 22 abortions per 1,000 women,
according to the state Department of Health. National figures for
1997 are not yet available.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department said there were a total of 27,055
abortions in Washington state in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, more limits have been imposed since the Supreme
Court allowed some restrictions on abortion in 1992, Republicans
took control of Congress, and anti-abortion activists turned their
attention to state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, states enacted 62 laws restricting
abortion and reproductive rights last year. The group said abortion
rights are seriously restricted in half the states in the nation,
and only five states, including Washington, largely protect
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL said Louisiana is now the state with the most restrictions
on abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The report, not surprisingly, was welcomed by abortion rights
supporters but criticized by abortion opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is heartbreaking that organizations like NARAL expend so
much energy producing score cards on how successful they have been
at destroying the lives of mothers and their unborn children,''
said Camille De Blasi, education director at Human Life of
Washington. ``We invite all people to work with us on positive and
life-affirming solutions to modern problems that don't involve
injury to those who are weak, defenseless or vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Karen Cooper, state director for NARAL, welcomed the report,
which she said reflected the hard work of abortion rights advocates
in Washington state from 1995 through 1998, when the Legislature
was anti-abortion. Last year, abortion rights supporters helped
defeat a statewide ballot measure that would have restricted
late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of Initiative 694 last year, which was rejected by 57
percent of the voters, marked the fourth time that Washington
residents have gone to the polls to express support for abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Washington voters passed the first voter-approved abortion
rights law in the nation in 1970, three years before abortion was
made legal nationwide by the Supreme Court. And in 1991 Washington
voters enacted a law that would keep abortion legal in Washington
even if the Supreme Court overturned its Roe vs. Wade decision
legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Among the features of Washington state law cited by the group
that make it protective of abortion rights:
</P>
<P>
   _ A law making it illegal to obstruct access to or disrupt the
operation of health care facilities, including abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   _ A law allowing state Medicaid funds to be used to pay for
abortions for poor women.
</P>
<P>
   _ A pilot program allowing women to buy emergency contraceptive
pills from a pharmacists without a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL is unhappy with two features of Washington state law _ a
clause allowing private hospital employees to refuse to participate
in abortions, and a restriction that says only doctors can perform
abortions. And the group pointed out that the number of abortion
providers in Washington has been dropping _ from 65 in 1992 to 57
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said she plans to turn her organization's attention to
measures that would reduce abortion rate in Washington state. She
said she will push for increased sex education for high school
students, and for a requirement that health insurance companies
provide coverage for contraception.

TIME AND READER'S DIGEST SAID TO DISCUSS LINK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Reader's Digest Association and Time Warner Inc. are in
talks to combine Reader's Digest with a number of Time Inc. titles
and direct marketing businesses, a person close to the talks said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Time Inc.'s chief executive, Don Logan, has held discussions
with Reader's Digest's new chief executive, Thomas Ryder, but a
deal is not expected to be announced soon, if at all. The two
companies have been in discussions for about eight months, the
person said.
</P>
<P>
   If an agreement was reached, Time Warner would become a partner
of the two foundations that together control 72 percent of the
Reader's Digest voting shares _ DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund
and Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund. As part of the joint
venture, they would market properties like Reader's Digest magazine
and Time-Life books.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Trachtenberg, director of communications for the two
foundations, would not comment on the talks, which were first
reported by Business Week in its Jan. 25 issue. Executives at Time
Warner, Time Inc. and Reader's Digest would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   A combination could benefit both Reader's Digest and Time
Warner's continuity-product business _ books or videos delivered to
consumers one at a time over an extended period. That industry has
been hurt by the success of electronic commerce over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Reader's Digest has been under pressure lately. In September,
the company announced it would cut several hundred jobs, sell some
paintings from its valuable art collection and reduce its dividend.
Ryder said then that the company hoped to attract a younger
audience to its flagship Reader's Digest magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The Publishers Information Bureau, which monitors advertising
pages and revenue for consumer magazines, released figures this
week that showed Reader's Digest ad revenue was up by 11.9 percent
from 1997 to 1998, to $237 million.

ATLANTA HAS AN ANSWER TO THE MOSS-CARTER DUO
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUWANEE, Ga. _ Tony Martin and Terance Mathis feel a little like
a dime-store version of the Minnesota Vikings' celebrated
wide-receiver duo, Randy Moss and Cris Carter. The Atlanta Falcons'
receivers do similar work, yet operate in relative anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   They will have a chance to make a statement Sunday, when the
Falcons meet the Vikings in Minneapolis for the National Football
Conference title and a trip to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Mathis have combined for 2,317 receiving yards, just
7 fewer than Moss and Carter, who are key components in an offense
that set a National Football League record with 556 points in the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Moss and Carter have more of an edge in touchdowns _ a
league-record 29 to 17 for Martin and Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cris is the one who throws the jabs and Randy is the one who
throws the uppercuts and the power punches,'' Mathis said. ``Those
guys work great together. When they put them on the same side with
each other, it's hard to match up with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pair of Falcons can also present plenty of problems for
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can break the defense down by going deep,'' Martin said.
``And Terance can break the defense down by moving the sticks, with
third-down plays. That's how we complement one another, although
he's also been a deep threat this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis tries to play down any comparison of the wide receiver
combinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony and I, all we do is go out and do what's asked of us,''
he said. ``And that's to make plays when it matters. It's not about
trying to outdo them. Of course we've got to stand there and watch
them play, but it's not about outdoing them. It's about helping our
team win this football game.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, standing several feet away, added: ``If they have more
yards than us on Sunday and we win the game, I'm very satisfied. I
just want to go out there and win the game, no matter what it
takes. I don't care if I don't have any catches.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin has been drawing double coverage more frequently than
Mathis, which may help explain Mathis' career-high 11 touchdowns
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about Terance Mathis,'' Falcons coach Dan
Reeves said. ``He doesn't want any credit. He just wants to be part
of a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis played four seasons with the Jets, the last in 1993, and
they were not pleasant ones. He started just one game in that time
and was often overlooked, he said, because of his lack of height.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the shortest receiver on the roster,'' he said. ``You
had guys ranging from 6-2 to 6-5. I was the only guy under 6 feet,
at 5-10. And they believed in big receivers at the time. I just
didn't get to play much.''
</P>
<P>
   He averaged a touchdown a year as a Jet. With the Falcons, he
has 44 in 5 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Once he became an unrestricted free agent with the Jets, Mathis
knew he would be leaving. The Falcons gave him a chance to play
near his Stone Mountain, Ga., home.
</P>
<P>
   When Reeves arrived last season, he scrapped the team's
run-and-shoot offense for a more conventional system. That left
Mathis wondering for a while how he would fit in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out that I was a blocker first and a pass receiver
second,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He still blocks, but he has evolved this season into much more
of a receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a 10th-year pro, arrived before this season as another
unrestricted free agent, from San Diego. He played for the Chargers
in Super Bowl XXIX in 1995. Though it was in a losing cause, Martin
has fond memories of the drama involved and has tried to convey the
experience to his teammates this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them it's wonderful, something you really can't
describe,'' he said. ``It's like an ultimate high.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time since 1980 that the Falcons (15-2) have
been something other than a wild-card playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years the organization has been through a lot of
players who've gone on to win Super Bowls,'' Mathis said. ``The
guys who are still here, who've stuck with it, we now have our
chance.''

MAKING A DIFFERENCE, A PLAYGROUND AT A TIME  (Eds: see also By KIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Barbara A. Barlow was not content simply to treat
the injuries she kept seeing when she came to Harlem in the
mid-1970s to lead the pediatric surgery unit at the Harlem Hospital
Center. She wanted to find the cause of what seemed an inordinately
high rate of injured children. What she found made her a crusader.
</P>
<P>
   Going out into the community, she discovered that children were
getting hurt on old, crumbling school playgrounds. Because there
were few or no sports or after-school programs in Harlem in those
years, children were playing in the streets and getting hit by
cars. The injury rate in Central Harlem was higher than for the
United States as a whole, and higher, as well, than in any of New
York City's suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, we felt we could never change safety unless we
changed the quality of children's lives,'' she said. ``To reduce
injuries in the inner-city community, you have to make
opportunities the same.''
</P>
<P>
   That, in its grandest and simplest terms, has been Barlow's
mission. She began a foundation to raise money to fix the school
playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Columbia University's School of Public Health, she
began a data base to correlate scientifically her observations
about pediatric injuries and poor play areas. In 1988, she got
funds from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a private
organization that provides money for health programs and research.
Her group, the Injury Prevention Program, has since turned 24
once-decrepit schoolyards into safe and fantasy-filled playscapes,
using foundation grants.
</P>
<P>
   Her work also set the example, community leaders in Upper
Manhattan say, that led to the establishment of other things, like
Harlem Little League and Ice Hockey in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Both were created in the 1990s to get children involved in
sports _ many for the first time in their lives _ with all expenses
paid by private donations.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in Harlem sports has been a blessing for the
neighborhood, Barlow said, but it almost all has come from private
and community efforts. The schools, she said, seem unchanged from
what she saw more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful that we have that now, but for 20 years there
was no Little League, nor were there any other teams in the
community _ there was nothing,'' she said. ``I think we need it
both in the community and the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Barlow is in the process of expanding the Injury Prevention
Program to other cities around the nation. Her successor as
director for New York, Aissatou Bey-Grecia, said the prevention
program's core strength was Barlow's vision that injury rates and
the quality play spaces and sports programs were interconnected _ a
fabric of causes and effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow we got disconnected from the fact that good physical
education helps make healthy children,'' Bey-Grecia said. ``Schools
are going to have to rethink this whole thing.''

 &HT;    Pro or con, admission to historic first day of trial hot ticket

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They came in twos and threes to the post office on
the first floor of the Capitol on Thursday, clutching the evidence
that would prove beyond a doubt that they were witnesses to
history.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the public who glimpsed 15 minutes worth of President
Clinton's impeachment trial put their undated tickets of admission
to the Senate galleries on the counter, bought a first-class stamp
and asked the obliging postmaster for a Jan. 14, 1999 postmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was struck by the momentousness of the occasion. It was a
very historic moment,'' John Davis of Herndon, Va., said. ``It was
worth the 90-minute wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was among those with strong opinions about what should
happen to President Clinton. ``He should be convicted and removed
from office,'' Davis said. ``I don't see how anyone can arrive at
any other decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many people on hand Thursday had reached different
conclusions. Among them was Cynthia Hartley, a senior at Agnes
Scott College in Decatur, Ga., who was in Washington for a seminar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole thing is, I have to say, a waste of time.
It's like beating a dead horse. Everyone knows what happened,''
Hartley said after returning a prized yellow ticket to the office
of Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.). Senators received three permanent
seats for the trial and some, like Cleland, made them available to
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment trial was the hot ticket in Washington on
Thursday, drawing former Capitol Hill staffers and tourists from as
far away as Australia. People waited in a cold, freezing rain in
the hopes of getting a seat in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Those who made it inside the galleries were not allowed to carry
cell phones or beepers. Even child whistles were being checked by
no-nonsense security guards.
</P>
<P>
   Spectators had front-row seats to a trial so rare that it has
happened only once before in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   But they also saw some curious sights. Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, who is presiding over the trial, stood from time to time
to stretch his chronically sore back.
</P>
<P>
   So did Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.), who stood at his desk or
walked stiffly to the back of the chamber. Wellstone recently
announced he would not run for president in 2000 because of his
back problems.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist announced in advance that he did not expect the trial
to pause while he stretched.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.) wore dark glasses after recent eye
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican prosecutors sat a specially built table on the
Democratic side of the chamber. The president's defense team sat at
an identical table on the Republican said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most extraordinary sight was that of 100 senators
more or less silent for extended periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``To sit for seven hours and not talk is an unnatural act for a
U.S. Senator,'' Cleland said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had anticipated having trouble staying awake, but was
pleasantly surprised he did not.
</P>
<P>
   Other senators were less kind to the House prosecutors. At one
point, Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) took the unusual move
of interrupting Rep. Ed Bryant (R-Tenn.) to take a 15-minute
recess. The senators were greatly relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking antibiotics for a cold and it's tough as hell to
stay awake,'' Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) said.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors did not seem to have the same trouble as they listened
to House Republican prosecutors press for Clinton's removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty easy to get engrossed in it,'' Tina Milne of
Springfield, Va. ``(Rep. James) Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) was saying
how the president shook his finger at us and lied and we were all
shaking our heads, 'Yes, I remember that,' `` she said.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Palchik, a senior at the University of Texas, said that
even if the issue is sex, ``we've forgiven him so many times. How
many more times can we forgive him?''
</P>
<P>
   But Al Flyr of Colfax, Iowa, said he would await Clinton's
defense before reaching any conclusions. ``It sounded pretty
damning,'' Flyr said. ``But a good attorney can convince you of
almost anything until you hear the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   The chance to see for himself the first presidential impeachment
trial in 131 years filled Greg Waddell, a one-time aide to former
Speaker Newt Gingrich, with awe.
</P>
<P>
   But Waddell said he hoped the 100 senators sitting as jurors in
the ornate chamber would be just that: jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they owe it to the citizens to keep their mind open
and not make any decisions in advance,'' said Waddell, who grew up
in Atlanta. ``My concern is that some senators have made up their
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to see it, witness it, strikes me in many ways,''
Waddell said. ``I keep thinking: If we can go through this as a
nation and survive, then we have really tested the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   For David Bossie, a former investigator on the House campaign
fund-raising inquiry who resigned amid controversy over his
actions, the trial represented a moment of reckoning.
</P>
<P>
   Bossie said he sensed victory around the corner for those who
have wanted to prosecute Clinton on a range of charges from the
failed Whitewater land deal to campaign fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like justice is being dispensed,'' said Bossie, who
also worked on the Senate Whitewater inquiry. ``The truth is
finally coming to light.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a safe bet that no came from farther away than Matthew
McGrane and Adam Baxter of Melbourne, Australia. They happened to
be in Washington as part of their three-week tour of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the first hint of the seriousness of it all,'' McGrane,
an Australian Broadcasting Company reporter, said. ``It was
interesting to see because I think people lost sight of the issue.
Did he lie under oath and commit perjury?''
</P>
<P>
   Baxter, an advertising agency owner, saw it differently. ``The
president had oral sex with an intern and he's going to lose his
job over it? In Australia, people think America has gone crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cleland's office, the happy ticket holders tended to agree
with Baxter. But Patricia Hartley of Atlanta, a Defense Department
employee, was glad for the chance to be part of the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask and I did and what do they say? Ask and you
shall receive,'' Hartley said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wade Williams, the assistant principal and basketball
coach at Bronx Regional High School, makes a promise to every boy
at the school: If you play basketball for me, he tells them, and
work harder than you ever have in your life, and stay out of
trouble and graduate, you will get you out of the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   In a neighborhood where the 1990s boom economy is somebody
else's news, Williams' promise is a beacon. It calls to young men
who see mostly dead ends around them, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what brings them to me, that promise,'' he said. ``And
I've been pretty good with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports still mean something very powerful in this school. In
some ways it is an old sports story _ the dream of using one's
talent to rise up, become something more than you are. But it is
also a very up-to-date New York sports story in its awareness of
limits.
</P>
<P>
   Williams makes no pretense that his basketball players are
angels. All of them ended up here because something happened. One
boy was kicked out of his old school for assault and battery. Many
others ran into academic trouble.
</P>
<P>
   These kids may dream of NBA careers and glamour, but they all
know that no one from Bronx Regional has ever got a scholarship to
anything better than a two-year junior college _ a juco, in the
jargon of the coaches and players. Williams says he is careful
never to promise more than that.
</P>
<P>
   But on that, and a shoestring budget of $1,048 for a school year
_ to run all the sports programs and the gym, too _ he has been
able to establish a basketball dynasty. In the Public Schools
Alternative League _ reserved for schools like his in which many of
the students are older _ Bronx Regional is the power to be reckoned
with.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 10 years, Williams' teams have played for the
championship every year and won it seven times, including the last
six in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a stepchild _ we don't get the publicity, we don't get
the money, I don't get a sneaker contract,'' he said. ``Whatever
I've got, I earned.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is enough to hook kids like Milton Rollins.
</P>
<P>
   Rollins, an 18-year-old native of the South Bronx, is a young
man with plans. On a recent day just before practice, he filled out
nine job applications. His first choice was a job in a sneaker
store, and the rest, he said, were there just in case. He dreams of
playing professional basketball but wants to study electrical
engineering _ again, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get out of the 'hood,'' he said. ``I'm positive
_ I'm sure _ I'm going to make it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams says his boys have helped him, too.
</P>
<P>
   Though he once dreamed of coaching in a traditional New York
City high school, he doesn't anymore. The rewards in the South
Bronx are too great to walk away from, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've got more to offer here,'' he said.

REPUBLICAN MANAGERS BEGIN PRESENTING THEIR CASE AGAINST CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an atmosphere of sober formality, the
impeachment trial of President William Jefferson Clinton began in
earnest on Thursday in the U.S. States Senate, with the Republican
prosecution asserting that he should be removed from office because
of ``egregious and criminal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No man is above the law, and no man is below it,'' said Rep.
F. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin a few moments after the gavel
fell, quoting President Theodore Roosevelt. Clinton was on trial,
Sensenbrenner said, because he ``decided to put himself above the
law not once, not twice, but repeatedly,'' to conceal his sexual
affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting as jurors in the momentous and divisive case, only the
second presidential impeachment trial in the history of the
Republic, the 100 members of the Senate listened in silence for six
hours as four Republican members of the House began laying out the
evidence. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, presiding, confined
himself to scripted procedural comments.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gray January day, with a freezing drizzle falling
intermittently outside. A tone of undertstatement was set at the
outset, when Rehnquist opened the proceedings with two laconic
sentences: ``The Senate will convene as a court of impoeachment.
The chaplain will offer a prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself was absent, traveling to Alexandria, Va., across
the Potomac River, to promote crime prevention. He had planned to
go on to Wall Street, to encourage brokers to invest more in
minority business, but put off the trip until Friday because of bad
flying weather.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most forceful argument was made by Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, from Clinton's home state, Arkansas. A former U.S.
attorney (and the brother of Sen. Tim Hutchinson), he used
effective graphics and careful organization to develop more clearly
than before the evidence that led House Republicans to vote an
article of impeachment charging obstruction of justice. From a
myriad of familiar details, he assembled coherent patterns and
chronologies and then drew potentially damaging conclusions from
them as to motive and credibility and relevance.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every turn,'' Hutchinson said of Clinton, ``he used
whatever means available to him to evade the truth, destroy
evidence, tamper with witnesses and any other action required to
prevent evidence coming forth that would prove a truth contrary to
the president's interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Worried that Ms. Lewinsky would expose their relationship,
Clinton and his aides engaged in ``what became a frenzied and
concerted effort to keep the holes plugged in the dike,''
Hutchinson added.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the inflammatory language that marked the
House hearings was absent, although Sensenbrenner, in an allusion
to the Watergate case, spoke of the need to excise ``a cancer on
the body politic.'' There were also what seemed to be occasional
misstatements and overstatements in tne material presented by the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the senators' deportment was much better than
the House members' had been. Most stayed in their seats, unwontedly
mute, sipping water, taking notes. A few stretched their backs
occasionally, as did Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   The decorum in the chamber suggested that after months of false
denouements, everyone realized that the last act of the drama had
begun.
</P>
<P>
   But the stream of partisanship flowed relentlessly outside, with
Democrats accusing the Senate Republicans of procedural
double-dealing. The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, insisted
again that the House case was based not on law but on political
revenge. And the House Republicans kept pressing, whenever they got
the chance, for the right to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson and the other prosecutors wove into their
presentations strong pleas that witnesses be called to testify,
including Ms. Lewinsky. At one point, Hutchinson said that he hoped
to be able to question Clinton's confidant, Vernon Jordan, under
oath about his role in securing a job for Ms. Lewinsky at precisely
the time that she was pondering whether to execute a false
affidavit that supported the president's testimony in the sexual
harassment suit filed by Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   With Jordan on the stand, Hutchinson said, ``You would need to
probe where his loyalties lie, listen to the tone of his voice,
look into his eyes and determine the truthfulness of his
statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson also suggested four other witnesses: Betty Currie,
Clinton's private secretary; John Podesta, the White House chief of
staff; Sidney Blumenthal, another presidential aide, and Clinton
himself. Lockhart immediately dismissed that last possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The witness question has been deferred until after the opening
statements. Thursday was the first of three days allotted to the
House Republican prosecutors. After a break on Sunday and Monday,
Martin Luther King Day, the president's lawyers, who listened
silently if intently on Thursday, will have three days to lay out
their rebuttal, and the senators will have two days to pose
questions, through the chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Senate will reach a crossroads. It must decide not only
whether to call witnesses but also whether to proceed any further
with the trial. The vote on witnesses or other new evidence will
come second, and not at all if the motion to end the trial carries.
Those votes require only simple majorities, not the two-thirds vote
needed to convict.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was 1:04 p.m., four minutes late, when the session began on
Thursday. The first prosecutor to speak was Rep. Henry J. Hyde of
Illinois, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. The public
galleries, accommodating only 50 people at a time, were full.
Officially, the prosecutors are referred to as ``managers,'' and
Rehnquist called upon him as ``Mr. Manager Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have pledged to put aside personal bias and partisan
interest and to do impartial justice,'' Hyde adminished the
senators, although they are in fact free to vote as they choose for
whatever reasons they chose or for no stated reason at all, without
regard to the usual rules of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he and his 12 colleagues on the panel of managers
were there ``as advocates for the rule of law, for equal justice
under the law and for the sanctity of the oath.'' Then he named the
other 12, all committee members, stated their legal qualifications
and made way for Sensenbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing beneath the marble dais on which Rehnquist sat in a
high-backed leather chair, resplendent in his black gown with four
gold stripes on each sleeve, Sensenbrenner said the president was
guilty of ``impeachable offenses,'' but he did not venture far into
the political and legal quagmire of exactly what constitutes an
impeachable offense. The definition was purposely left imprecise by
the founding fathers, and the Senate will eventually have to flesh
it out. The prosecutors will make their case on that issue on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN START HERE)
</P>
<P>
   But the Wisconsin lawmaker did note that the Constitution listed
bribery as an impeachable offence and that perjury carries an
identical penalty under the federal guideline. He said that
``perjury is the twin brother of bribery'' and hence one of the
``high crimes and misdemeanors'' meant by the framers.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner commended Clinton for having confessed to an
improper relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, then a 21-year-old White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
   But he continued, in a flat Midwestern monotone that belied the
high drama of the occasion: ``He has not owned up to the false
testimony, the stonewalling and legal hairsplitting and obstructing
the courts from finding the truth. In doing so, he has turned his
affair into a public wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Next came Rep. Ed Bryant of Tennessee, charged with sketching in
the background of the events that led to the impeachment. Reaching
into the grab-bag of modern technology, he used a giant television
screen, erected in the Senate for the first time, to project the
image of Clinton taking the oath of office as president and
pledging to uphold the nation's laws.
</P>
<P>
   A certain ennui had settled over the chamber by the time he
finished. Nothing new was being said, and the old things were not
being said with either eloquence or color. But Hutchinson changed
the mood, as did Rep. James E. Rogan of California, who followed
him to spell out in exhaustive detail the Republicans' several
allegations of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson made a number of points that seemed telling, though
it was not possible to tell whether they had any impact on the
senators.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has made much of the fact that Ms. Lewinsky's
job search started well before it was known that she was on the
Jones witness list. But Hutchinson was able to show that the search
gained urgency only in the hours immediately after the president
learned on Dec. 10 that she was on the list. Before that, by
Jordan's own testimony, it had a low priority.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson also noted that her denial of a sexual relationship
in an affidavit Clinton suggested she make came before the judge in
the Jones case defined a sexual relationship. It should therefore
be construed as normal _ not legal _ language, Hutchinsion
suggested, and therefore a lie that the president encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   He did not mention, however, that Clinton testified that he
thought she could file a truthful document and that he never saw
what she did file until later.

OBSERVERS AGREE SENATE TRIAL LACKS DRAMATIC FLAIR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Los Angeles attorney Wanda Parker arrived at the
Capitol Thursday with a ticket to what had been billed as the
hottest courtroom drama in town.
</P>
<P>
   But after spending a few hours in the Senate chamber listening
to Republican House members present their case against President
Clinton, Parker left disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their arguments weren't very animated,'' the 25-year-old
lawyer said. ``Even the senators didn't seem very impressed. It was
like `I've heard it all before.'``
</P>
<P>
   Even as President Clinton's impeachment trial finally shifted
into high gear with opening arguments, there was a sense that
little new had been added to the sex and lies saga involving former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The major television networks switched back to the soap operas
and talk shows after an hour or so, leaving the live coverage to
the all-news cable networks and PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the senators, dutifully acting as jurors, sat
silently at their wooden desks for six hours as House members,
serving as prosecutors, rose one-by-one to try and make the case
that the president obstructed justice and committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   It was a frustrating role for many of the 100 senators who are
more accustomed to orating and legislating than listening.
</P>
<P>
   Some scribbled furiously in their notebooks while others shifted
uncomfortably in their seats or stared at galleries filled with
tourists and invited guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough not to snore,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenburg, D-N.J.,
talking to reporters as he purchased candy in the Capitol Cafeteria
during a brief break. ``What happens is your eyelids begin to take
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, was a little more charitable,
explaining that most jury trials are not very exciting . He likened
the pace of the arguments to that of baseball game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a lot activity for awhile and then there is a
whole lot of activity, '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., said that he was surprised
that the proceedings were not as boring as he expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have a front row seat in American history,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But even Cleland acknowledged the frustration with the rules
prohibiting the lawmakers from making speeches or talking to others
during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an unnatural act for a United States senator,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The mandatory no-talking rules were part of decorum guidelines
handed to all of the senators. The memo instructed lawmakers to
plan to attend all of the proceedings and warned them to turn off
their cell phones and beepers while in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Senators were also urged not to bring in any reading matter that
did not pertain to the impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The hordes of media covering the event also found their access
to the senators limited as the police barred reporters from
hallways surrounding the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   A number of senators, invoking the oath they took to ``render
fair and impartial judgement, were uncharacteristically shy about
voicing their opinions in front of the cameras and microphones.
</P>
<P>
   But others couldn't resist a chance to sound off.
</P>
<P>
   ``All politics is vocal,'' said Lautenberg. He called ``a little
hyperbolic'' the remark by one of the House prosecutors, Rep. James
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., that the ``failure to bring President
Clinton to account for serial lying under oath ... will cause a
cancer to be present in our society for generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said that after listening to several
hours of testimony, ``I didn't hear anything I haven't heard
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the familiarity with the story, tourists lined up in the
chilly rain outside the Capitol for a chance to spend some time
watching the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Housely, a fifth-grade teacher from Akron, Ohio, said she
was impressed at how meticulously the House members had documented
the unfolding of the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe they have everything down, minute by minute,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Housely said she was still not convinced Clinton
should be ousted from office and said the House prosecutors relied
too much on Lewinsky's account of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do they want to believe her over him?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Thornell, a 23-year old student at Cornell University, said
that although he didn't hear anything new, he was still excited to
witness only the second impeachment trial in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go home and put my ticket in a glass case,'' said
Thornell, who was able to avoid standing out in the cold because
his brother, who works for Vice President Al Gore got tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the president's staunchest friends and most bitter
enemies also showed up for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, one of Clinton's defenders on
the House Judiciary Committee, sat in the chamber for most of the
afternoon. She was joined by another Texas Democrat, Rep. Ruben
Hinojosa.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the front row of the gallery was David Bosse, a
former top aide to Clinton foe Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind. Bosse lost
his job last year after he was blamed for distributing selective
portions of tapes of prison phone conversations by Clinton friend
Webster Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   Bosse wouldn't say who gave him tickets but added that he had
once worked in the Senate and knew people there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here because this is history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the opening arguments may have lacked dramatic flair,
there is still the possibility that the proceedings could heat up,
particularly if the Senate decides to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Even Parker, the Los Angeles lawyer, said she was intrigued by
the possibility that Lewinsky might be summoned to testify before
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be exciting,'' she said.

WB'S `ZOE, DUNCAN' BEARS PRODUCER'S SHODDY STAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new WB comedy ``Zoe, Duncan, Jack &AMP; Jane,'' which used to be
called ``Zoe Bean'' (a title that was at least memorable), purports
to be, if you must get right down to it ... ``Seinfeld'' with an
orthodontist's touch.
</P>
<P>
   Four teenagers. New York City. So-called ``observational humor''
with a mean streak. And yes, it's genuinely, emphatically,
ringingly about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   There are noteworthy differences, aside from the characters'
ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seinfeld'' was funny, for one thing, whereas ``Zoe'' et al.,
which Sunday, is a Michael Jacobs Production.
</P>
<P>
   Here I could fly off into a superfluous assessment of the TV
oeuvre of Michael Jacobs, ultra-prolific producer. That would be
unkind. Let's stick with his TV credits: ``Charles in Charge,''
``The Torkelsons,'' ``Dinosaurs,'' ``My Two Dads,'' ``Boy Meets
World,'' ``You Wish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You Wish'' was the genie show in the fall of 1997. Jacobs is
still bitter. He thinks it flopped because the public wasn't buying
genie shows.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs: ``In the beginning it was very easy to put a genie on
the air with an astronaut, and it would run a long time. Try
putting a genie on now.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, try putting a puppet dinosaur on now. I digress.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Zoe, Ted, Carol and Alice,'' Jacobs fashions
himself the ``shepherd'' for a sitcom that was created by its
novice supervising producers, the husband-and-wife team of Daniel
and Sue Paige.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Jacobs has been the shepherd, or sausage grinder,
for worse shows. ``Zoe, Chico, Harpo and Zeppo'' nearly rises to
the level of mediocrity, practically a triumph for Michael Jacobs
Productions.
</P>
<P>
   Zoe (Selma Blair), Duncan (David Moscow), Jack (Michael
Rosenbaum) and Jane (Azura Skye) talk on the telephone, ride the
subways, get doggie doo on their shoes and lust for the opposite
sex.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Zoe is lusting for a college heartthrob (guest star
Scott Foley of ``Felicity'') who is the brother of Zoe's
wheelchair-using and obnoxious classmate.
</P>
<P>
   For unknown reasons, this determinedly '90s show is succulent
with throw-off '70s references _ a title reminiscent of a 1970s
movie, a brief homage to ``Saturday Night Fever'' and more. It's a
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Thematically, at least, ``Zoe, Winken, Blinken and Nod'' is
right down the WB's narrow strike zone: teens who seem sort of
young and sort of old, all at once. And who, by appearances, could
be anywhere from 16 to 30.
</P>
<P>
   The cast itself nearly straddles that range. Blair and Rosenbaum
are 26. Moscow is 24. Skye is 17.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Rosenbaum's Jack and Skye's Jane are supposed to
be twins. Never mind that they're nine years apart and haven't an
iota of family resemblance.
</P>
<P>
   Why? I'm stumped. All I know is, just (set ital)try(end ital)
putting a genie on now.

RECORD OF FORMER WISCONSIN WELFARE RECIPIENTS IS MIXED 
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By JASON DePARLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though Wisconsin's radical welfare experiment has drawn more
interest than the programs of other states, until this week there
was no information on what was happening to the droves of people
leaving the rolls. In a statistical vacuum, the key question _ ``is
it working?'' _ was answered with a mix of hopes, fears and dueling
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Now state officials have released a trove of information, on
everything from the number of former welfare recipients with access
to a car (54 percent) to the number who say they have been forced
to abandon their children (5 percent). But in an environment of
sudden statistical abundance, the question of ``is it working?''
still remains a matter of hopes, fears and dueling opinions.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps it always will.
</P>
<P>
   The state's welfare program, Wisconsin Works or ``W-2,'' which
began in October 1997, is both unusually stringent and unusually
generous, at least on paper. Everyone on the rolls is required to
work, with virtually no exceptions. But the state has created
thousands of community service jobs and pledged support services,
like child care, to all who need them.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the percentage of former recipients who
found jobs has remained high, even as the welfare exodus reached
deeper and deeper into the caseload. Sixty-two percent of the
former recipients were working at the time of the survey, and 83
percent had worked sometime in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Citing such numbers, Larry Mead, a welfare expert at New York
University, went so far as to argue that ``these work levels
represent the greatest achievement in anti-poverty policy since the
Great Society'' programs created under Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that economic difficulties remained common and
for some recipients grew worse. Despite the state's booming
economy, sizable minorities reported problems paying for such
basics as utilities (47 percent), housing (37 percent) and food (32
percent). Indeed, after leaving welfare, families grew almost 50
percent more likely to experience an inability to buy groceries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This supports the view of advocates who say the program has
serious problems,'' said Pamela Fendt, a researcher at the
University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Though subject to wildly varying interpretation, the study is
destined to attract much attention from around the country. More
than a dozen states have done similar studies, but Wisconsin's
began after about 75 percent of the caseload _ presumably those
most employable _ had already left the rolls. Therefore, it gives
the first glimpse of how the nation's least job-ready recipients
may ultimately fare.
</P>
<P>
   Though Wisconsin is now dealing with a more troubled portion of
the caseload, the percentage of ``leavers'' finding work remained
comparable to the rates in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with those at the bottom of the employability
ladder, yet our work levels are on par with states that have
reformed much less radically,'' said J. Jean Rogers, who runs the
Wisconsin welfare program. ``That implies either that we
underestimated the employability of our most disadvantaged clients
or that Wisconsin's done a good job of promoting and sustaining
work.''
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, the study found most recipients were
earning considerably more than the minimum wage of $5.15 an hour.
The average wage was $7.42 an hour, with the median wage $7 an
hour. Of those employed, 57 percent said they worked 40 hours or
more a week; 23 percent worked between 30 and 39 hours; 10 percent
worked between 20 and 29 hours; and 9 percent said they were worked
less than 20 hours. On average, the study estimated weekly earnings
of $262 for those who had jobs.
</P>
<P>
   At that rate, a former recipient who worked all year would earn
about $13,600 _ just a few dollars shy of the official poverty
threshold for a family of three. But such a worker could also
qualify for tax credits worth several thousand dollars, lifting him
or her out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   On the negative side, fewer than half of the former recipients _
47 percent _ said they had more money now than when they were on
welfare. When asked whether ``they were just barely making it,'' 68
percent answered yes. The study also asked about 17 types of
material hardship, such as the ability to afford food, housing and
child care. Few of the areas showed substantial improvements since
recipients left welfare, and in five categories recipients said
things had gotten worse.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, only 22 percent of former recipients said they had
been unable to afford food while they were receiving welfare, but
32 percent said they had had such problems since leaving the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   In general, surveys of this sort tend to underestimate the
actual amount of hardship since the most troubled people are the
hardest to find. Wisconsin was able to locate 69 percent of the
former recipients it tried to contact, a good rate by national
standards. But the response rate was lowest in Milwaukee, the urban
center where troubled clients are most concentrated.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though the report is full of numbers, almost all can be bent to
varying interpretations. Though a high percentage say they ``are
barely making it,'' for instance, that is a highly subjective
question. A high percentage of the country as a whole might answer
the same way. What is more, it is impossible to predict whether
things will get better or worse with time.
</P>
<P>
   It is plausible that the earnings will grow and hardships
diminish as former recipients settle into their new roles as
workers. ``This is a new experience for them,'' said Ms. Rogers,
the state official. As people grow more adept at budgeting, she
said, problems with food and housing will abate.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also plausible that hardships may increase, especially
for the 38 percent still unemployed. Many may be relying on the
short-term help of family and friends _ doubling up with a cousin,
say, or leaning on a boyfriend. Those arrangements tend to unravel
with time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't know if this is a bumpy start to things getting
better or the beginnings of something more sinister,'' said Tom
Corbett, a professor of social work at the University of Wisconsin
in Madison. Indeed, things may simultaneously grow better and
worse, depending on which part of the caseload is sampled.
</P>
<P>
   There is one useful point of comparison. The Wisconsin study
borrowed a survey used earlier in South Carolina. While the
Wisconsin economy is somewhat better _ its unemployment rate at the
time the study began was 3.2 percent, compared with 4.4 percent in
South Carolina _ its levels of hardship ran higher. Only 13 percent
of former South Carolina recipients reported an inabilty to buy
food, for instance, compared with 32 percent in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Why the difference? At the time of its last survey, South
Carolina had only cut the rolls by about half, compared wirth
three-quarters in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's evidence that the farther we go down the rolls, the more
problems we see,'' said Jack Tweedie, who tracks welfare programs
for the National Conference of State Legislators. ``We're not going
to conclude that welfare reform `worked' or `didn't work' _ it'll
work for some and not for others.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In laying out their case of perjury and obstruction
of justice against President Clinton Thursday, the House managers
regularly invoked federal statutes designed to give prosecutors the
widest possible leeway in determining whether to charge someone
with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., who detailed the obstruction case
against the president, began his presentation by saying that, ``The
evidence will show there was a scheme developed to obstruct the
administration of justice and that is illegal,'' language taken in
part from the federal criminal code.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is that language written more broadly than in the
statute dealing with obstruction of justice. Criminal law experts
said it can allow prosecutors to bring charges on only a suggestion
that someone tried to interfere with a court proceeding. With that
leeway, the Republicans on Thursday offered a wide-ranging
narrative of various actions by the president which, taken
together, they said, should persuade the Senate that Clinton tried
to foil the workings of both a federal grand jury and the sexual
misconduct trial of Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction statutes referred to Thursday by Rep. James
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who provided an overview of the case,
include, for example, one law known as the ``Omnibus Provision.''
</P>
<P>
   It allows for charging someone who, by any communication,
``endeavors to influence, obstruct or impede the administration of
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Roscoe C. Howard Jr., a former federal prosecutor who teaches
criminal justice at the University of Kansas, said that the law's
standards are vague enough to allow a prosecutor to bring any
charge anytime where there is even only a suggestion of an adverse
impact on the court system.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson detailed seven acts, any one of which the Republicans
assert could amount to an obstruction scheme. They include charges
that Clinton persuaded Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit for
the Jones lawsuit; discussed a cover story to conceal their
relationship; tried to conceal the gifts they exchanged; got her a
job to buy her cooperation; allowed his attorney to make false
statements to the judge in the Jones case; tried to ``corruptly
influence'' the testimony of his secretary, Betty Currie, and lied
to his close aides so they could spread his false denials.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela H. Bucy, a former federal prosecutor who teaches criminal
law at the University of Alabama Law School, said statutes like the
one on obstruction are intentionally written to afford prosecutors
great leeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have broadly drawn statutes because people who
engage in obstruction of justice are generally very creative, very
clever at achieving their ends,'' she said. In recent years
Congress even amended the obstruction laws to make it easier to
deal with cases like that involving Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky.
Before the 1988 change, courts were obliged to throw out
convictions for obstruction in cases where someone had merely asked
another to lie in his or her behalf but did not offer any threats
or inducements to do so.
</P>
<P>
   That might have covered any conversations between Clinton and
Ms. Lewinsky, since any effort to conceal their relationship was
probably mutual.
</P>
<P>
   But the section of the law that deals with influencing a
witness' testimony was changed so that one could be charged just
for ``corruptly persuading,'' rather than coercing, another person
to tell a lie in a court proceeding, a phrase also used by the
managers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Bucy said that the broadness of the statute carries with
it an obligation on the prosecutor for some finely honed
discretion. Prosecutors, she said, are entitled to conclude that
someone's action might technically meet the elements of a criminal
law but are not worthy of prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Clinton, she said it could be argued that
whatever efforts he made to conceal the Lewinsky relationship were
aimed at avoiding embarrassment and not to foil the workings of the
criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers, for their part, have put forward a two-track
defense that they will begin making before the Senate next week.
They have argued that the elements are unproven, that is, there are
other explanations for each of the seven actions Hutchinson
outlined.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in their filings with the Senate they have
claimed that the offenses, even if true, do not rise to the level
of an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   In one dispute over facts, Hutchinson said the obstruction began
on Dec. 5, 1997, when Ms. Lewinsky's name first appeared on a list
of potential witnesses in the Jones trial. He said Clinton's
efforts to help Ms. Lewinsky find a desirable job in New York
intensified the next week after the trial judge ruled that Mrs.
Jones' lawyers could take testimony from other women reported to
have been involved with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House has produced evidence showing that Clinton
had sought to help Ms. Lewinsky a month earlier, before her name
surfaced in the Jones lawsuit. Hutchinson asserted Thursday that
the job search was moribund until Clinton became energized by the
possibility that Ms. Lewinsky could hurt him in the Jones trial.

 &HT;    Prosecutors press need for witnesses, portray Clinton as `serial
liar'
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett and Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House prosecutors on Thursday portrayed President
Clinton as a ``serial liar'' and manipulative commander in chief
who subverted the judicial system to conceal his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In their opening day of arguments in the nation's first
impeachment trial in 131 years, the House prosecutors also sought
to lay out a convincing case for calling witnesses, a contentious
issue the Senate has not yet resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The six-hour presentation was steeped in facts, quotations from
depositions and, on occasion, a video appearance from Clinton
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Although the House managers had hinted they would disclose new
evidence, the most novel aspect of their presentation was a
forceful call for witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is telling the truth?'' demanded Rep. James Rogan
(R-Calif.), the last of five House prosecutors who spoke Thursday.
``We urge this body to bring forth the witnesses and place them all
under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   House managers have not put Lewinsky on any official witness
list, but Democrats said they were convinced that the former White
House intern is at the top of their list. House judiciary committee
staffers contacted Lewinsky's attorneys about a pre-trial interview
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a spectacle most of the American people would
not want,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.)
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy, standing in the freezing rain
outside the Capitol, said the House case was ``unsubstantiated and
circumstantial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to presenting our defense case based on the
facts, the law and the constitution, so all of us can move quickly
back to the business of the American people,'' Kennedy said. The
White House will have three days to present the president's defense
beginning next Tuesday, the day Clinton is scheduled to deliver his
state of the union speech.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was far away from the proceedings, Clinton made
several cameo apperances in the Senate chamber _ on audio and video
tape. Rep. Ed Bryant (R-Tenn.) said the case against Clinton really
began on a cold day in January 1993 and then proceeded to play a
tape of Clinton taking the oath of office, administered by
Rehenquist, at his innauguration. The tape was supposed to be in
video but the picture mysteriously did not appear, so senators only
heard Clinton swear to ``preserve and defend the constitution of
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Reps. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.) and Rogan played numerous
snippetts of Clinton's Aug. 17 grand jury testimony, the one in
which the managers claim that Clinton perjured himself in answering
questions about his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury video tape was also meant to buttress the
argument that the Senate will have to call witnesses if they are to
reconcile differences between what Clinton said and what Lewinsky
and other witnesses said about their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) opened the managers'
presentation and, as he did so often in the House impeachment
inquiry, sought to define the case against Clinton in the gravest
possible terms.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde reminded senators of the sanctity of the oath of office and
told senators the story of Sir Thomas More of England, who went to
his death 450 years ago rather than swear allegience to a King whom
he believed corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are now stewards of the oath,'' Hyde told the senators.
``Depending on what you decide, it will either be strengthened in
its power to achieve justice or it will go the way of so much of
our moral infrastructure and become a mere convention, full of
sound and fury, signifying nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde didn't mention Lewinsky once in his opening remarks. And in
deference to the perceived dignity of the Senate chamber, the House
managers took great pains not to make explicit references to sex,
and who touched whom.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the prohibition appeared to border on the absurd.
Rogan said he intentionlly ``sanitized'' the definition of sexual
relations that the court adopted when Clinton was deposed in Paula
Jones sexual harrassment lawsuit. The definition, which refers to
genetalia and other body parts, has been publicized repeatedly for
months. Rogan merely called them ``ennumerated body parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), who followed Hyde, said the
case against Clinton was ``not about the president's affair with a
subordinate employee, an afffair that was both inappropriate and
immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Clinton has recognized that this relationship was wrong,''
Sensenbrenner said. ``I give him credit for that. But he has not
owned up to false testimony, the stonewalling and legal
hairsplitting, and obstructing the courts from finding the truth.
In doing so, he has turned his affiar into a public wrong. And for
these actions, he must be held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner noted that the Senate had impeached three federal
judges in the 1980s for some form of lying _ Judge Harry Claiborne
for lying on income tax returns, Judge Alcee Hastings for lying
under oath during a trial and Judge Walter Nixon for lying to a
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perjury is the twin brother of bribery,'' said Sensenbrenner.
``The truth is the truth and a lie is a lie. There cannot be
different levels of the truth for judges than for presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson, from Clinton's home state of Arkansas, laid out the
obstruction of justice charge agaisnt Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   _ The president personally encouraged Lewinsky to provide false
testimony to the attorneys representing Paula Jones, the former
Arkansas state employee who filed a sexual harrassment suit against
the president that started the whole scandal.
</P>
<P>
   _ The president had direct involvement in making sure that
Lewinsky got a job at a time when she was also a witnesss in the
Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   _ The president personally, with corrupt intentions, tampered
with the testimony of a prospective witness, Betty Currie, the
president's personal secretary.
</P>
<P>
   _ By direct and circumstantional evidence the president
personally directed the concealment of evidence under subpoena in a
judicial proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   _ The president personally allowed false representations to be
made by his attorney, Robert Bennet, to a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   _ The president intentionally provided false information to
witnesses before a federal grand jury knowing that thos statements
would be repeated with the intent to obstruct the proceedings of a
federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seven pillars of this obstruction case were personally
constructed by the president of the United States,'' Hutchinson
said. ``It was done with the intent that the truth and evidence
would be suppressed in a civil rights case pending against him. The
goal was to win, and he was not going to let the judicial system
stand in his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sworn under Senate rules to remain silent under pain of
imprisonment, senators appeared for the most part to heed their
imposed silence on the Senate floor. They sat solemnly listening to
the testimony. Many took notes on yellow legal pads, or more
personalized leather notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a presidential candidate in 2000,
appeared to read some newspaper clippings in a notebook at one
point. Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, recovering from eye surgery
Wednesday, wore dark glasses. Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) appeared to
nod off.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Senate chamber, the hallways were overrun with
journalists, capitol police and tourists. Senators, for the most
part, carried their vow of silence inside the chamber to the
outside corrridors, declining invitations to speak to the news
cameras during the trial's one and only 15-minute break.
</P>
<P>
   A few offered some brief comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems strange to have arguments coming only from one
party,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.). ``But then only one party
decided this would be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wy.) said the House managers were doing
their job. ``They are laying out their case. It doesn't
particularly matter if it's new or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just started,'' said Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.). ``I intend
to hear it out and then I'll have lots of impressions.''

SO WHAT IF IT'S TRASH, IF IT HAS STYLE?  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 17)
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ My roommate, James, has a ritual: When he goes for a
walk, he scans the sidewalks for stray chairs, wayward tables and
homeless armoires. When he returns, I never know what will
accompany him through the front door.
</P>
<P>
   Once, he brought in a 6-foot-high, mint-green wardrobe that he
found on West 13th Street in Manhattan, outside St. Vincent's
Hospital. No one, including me, understood what attracted him to
this monstrosity until he stripped it to its natural color, sanded
and refinished it. People now marvel at how this ugly duckling has
become such a swan.
</P>
<P>
   Ask New Yorkers _ especially young people in studio apartments _
where they find their furnishings, and many will respond, proudly,
``On the street.'' For them, it's a badge of honor to be known as a
garbage shopper in a ridiculously expensive city, someone with both
the brains to spot a jewel in the junk and the brawn to lug it down
God knows how many blocks and up God knows how many flights of
stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most city dwellers pay hard cash for most of their
home furnishings. But among the 20-somethings, there is a definite
cheap-chic esthetic. The idea is to find items that cost little _
or nothing _ but that together create an atmosphere of rustic
gentility.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, it's O.K. to throw an expensive item or two into
the mix. The chairs don't have to match, but the colors should. The
overall look should make a visitor think: ``Wow! They've created a
minor masterpiece on a shoestring.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the college dorm look _ halogen lamps, beer-bottle
art, milk crates as coffee tables _ doesn't fly, nor does the
downright tacky. The goal is to acquire inexpensive stuff that
doesn't look its price and doesn't act it.
</P>
<P>
   People used to buy a plywood dresser at a store with low prices
``and it did the job until you put your clothes in and the bottom
fell out,'' says Christine Dimmick, 29, founder of the Good Home
Company, a home accessories and bath catalogue. ``You always got
people who foraged through the trash or went to the Salvation Army,
but nowadays they're honing in on what their style is and choosing
quality over quantity. People are more apt to spend money on a few
classic pieces, like a Knoll or Eames chair, and then supplement
that from inexpensive stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some Manhattanites, who were appalled by the arrival of
Kmart, Ms. Dimmick says she was ``thrilled'' and can't wait for
Wal-Mart to come, too.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the business agreed that there was much to be found in
inexpensive stores. ``Young people can't afford the Ralph Lauren
Home Collection,'' said Jackie Glanz, president of MG Concepts, a
designer of merchandise display areas in Central Islip, N.Y. ``But
they know you can find good designs at Kmart or J.C. Penney,''
</P>
<P>
   Pilar Newton can speak to that. A cartoon animator, Ms. Newton,
25, furnished most of her Brooklyn apartment from thrift shops,
sidewalks and Kmart. She knows her markets, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradlee's is terrific, because they have things for every part
of the house, from linens to kitchen appliances,'' she says.
``Kmart is good for towels, shower curtains, Martha Stewart Living
linens.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to foraging, though, anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   A friend's mother gave her a secondhand dining room table, and
little by little she found chairs on the street, none of which
match. Eventually, she plans to reupholster them; meanwhile, who
cares? ``In the past, no one would be caught dead with mismatched
chairs, but today? It doesn't matter as long as it doesn't look
cheap,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Dimmick, who is also the author of ``Home File,'' a
home decoration guide (Andrews McMeel, 1998), she spent about $600
on furnishings for her 800-square-foot apartment in Chelsea,
including a $120 bed frame from a thrift shop. While she, too,
loves to browse the streets and in flea markets (where she
recommends going during blizzards and rainstorms, when there are
fewer shoppers and the vendors are more likely to reduce prices),
she prefers heading directly to original sources, like hardware
stores, or outlets for restaurants or medical-supplies. She's also
a fan of stores where every item costs 99 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, they have ugly vases, but they also have lots of cute
glass bottles and things,'' she says. ``You can use ordinary
materials in a different way to create a stylish look.''
</P>
<P>
   Stylish but cheap: It makes a lot of sense when the biggest
challenge facing young New Yorkers isn't furnishing an apartment;
it's finding one they can afford.

RISING NET STOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Andy Moog might have the easiest job in
hockey.
</P>
<P>
   For the next six months, Moog is being paid to scout the NHL's
goalies and report to the expansion Atlanta Thrashers, who likely
will make a netminder their first selection in June's expansion
draft.
</P>
<P>
   But while the former Stars goalie said he has much work to do,
the truth of the matter is Moog can do most of his scouting in
North Texas, where the Stars' Roman Turek has established himself
as the best backup goaltender in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said it three years ago,'' Moog said of the season he and
Turek were Stars teammates. ``Roman can play this game and is going
to be a solid NHL goaltender.''
</P>
<P>
   Turek, who defeated the San Jose Sharks, 2-1, last night, is in
a unique situation. Not only are the Stars delighted with his 7-1-2
record and 1.78 goals-against average, so is the rest of the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion draft makes it extremely difficult to protect two
goalies, so there is a belief the Stars could lose either Turek or
No. 1 goalie Ed Belfour by next season. It's almost certain the
top-rated goaltending combination in the NHL (combined GAA of 1.90)
will not be back together, and with Belfour under contract for
another season at $3.5 million and playing well, it appears the
player who likely will leave is Turek.
</P>
<P>
   Turek's agent, Rich Winter, already has said the 28-year-old
native of the Czech Republic needs to be a No. 1 goalie next season
_ either in Dallas or someplace else. And Turek said the drive to
be a No. 1 goalie is strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only live my life one day at a time,'' he said. ``I want
to be No. 1; I want chance to play more. I have said that before.
But that is not what I am here. I play my game here behind Eddie
and I'm still learning.''
</P>
<P>
   But while he's learning, teammates say Turek also is proving a
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's making a statement,'' defenseman Craig Ludwig
said. ``Roman hasn't had the chance to play that much, and he wants
to show everyone what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the message is clear _ Turek can do just about anything.
At 6-foot-3, he fills up plenty of net. At 200 pounds, he is quick
and nimble enough to play a style that allows him to flop on the
ice when necessary and still get back on his skates quick enough to
play a more conventional standup style.
</P>
<P>
   Turek also has learned to deal with the smaller rink size of the
NHL and the increased traffic in front of the net. After playing
six seasons in Europe on bigger rinks, he said the transition was
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard at first, especially with rebounds,'' Turek said.
``Now, players are already on top of you. If you leave one rebound
in front, there is someone there to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said Turek has made the adjustment to
the back-alley, stick-swinging North American-style of hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turek's biggest change is mental toughness,'' Hitchcock said.
``He was a goalie who, at times, was passive around the net area.
Now, he's very aggressive, he's covering rebounds that he might
have let lie last year and he's challenging shooters
consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes Moog draw up a favorable report for his
employers in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roman has all the assets,'' said Moog, a Coppell resident who
is splitting his time between watching NHL goalies and running the
Western Professional Hockey League's Fort Worth Brahmas. ``All he
really needs is to get more games and gain experience.''
</P>
<P>
   And with those improvements, who knows where he might end up.
GOALIE SHUFFLE With the Atlanta Thrashers expected to covet goalie
Roman Turek in June's expansion draft, the Stars have six months to
consider a few options.
</P>
<P>
   1. Trade Turek before the March 23 trade deadline, when his
value likely will be highest. This won't happen because the Stars
would leave themselves vulnerable without an experienced No. 2
goalie in the quest for this year's Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   2. Trade Turek between the end of the season and the June 25
expansion draft. This is a possibility, especially if Ed Belfour
takes the Stars to the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   3. Keep Turek and trade Belfour. This might be a possibility if
the Stars do not win the Cup and Belfour performs poorly in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   4. Protect both goalies and leave players such as Shawn Chambers
and Grant Marshall unprotected. This could create a problem in
signing Turek, who is a restricted free agent and might hold out if
he's not the No. 1 goalie with the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   5. Make a deal with Atlanta to not take Turek and give them a
key prospect or draft pick. This is a likely scenario. But again,
Turek wants to be a No. 1 goalie next season and that seems
improbable if Belfour still is with the Stars.

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS CENSURED BY SEC 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal regulators censured PricewaterhouseCoopers, the world's
largest accounting firm, Thursday for violating a basic rule that
all auditors must follow to be independent from the companies they
audit.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission's lawyers said they had
discovered 70 instances where the accounting firm's partners,
employees or pension fund had invested in companies that the firm
audits.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal securities laws, auditors cannot own any interest
in companies that they audit. The rule is necessary because an
auditor's job is to help protect investors by giving an unbiased
opinion on whether a company's financial statements are fair and
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the improper investments, PricewaterhouseCoopers'
auditors were not independent when they audited the financial
statements of 70 companies, and the companies did not receive the
independent audit required by securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   The firm has contacted all of the companies involved. Regulators
did not disclose the companies' names, but said that only four
cases involved accountants investing in a company where they
personally worked on the company's audit or performed other
services.
</P>
<P>
   In the other cases, the accountants did not actually work on the
audits of the companies they had invested in. Or, the firm's
pension plan had invested in companies the firm audits.
</P>
<P>
   Richard H. Walker, director of the SEC's enforcement division,
said that regulators had not discovered problems in any of the 70
companies' financial statements and did not plan to ask the
companies to have their financial statements audited again by
another accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really looking at the issuers as the victims in this
case,'' Walker said, ``because they did not know their auditors
were not independent.''
</P>
<P>
   But the regulators' censure must have been disconcerting to many
of the firm's partners, who have been grappling with smoothing
day-to-day operations since July, when the accounting giant was
created by the merger of Price Waterhouse and Coopers &AMP; Lybrand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We abhor and regret these deviations from firm standards,''
the accounting firm said in a statement. ``While we and our
predecessor firms have always had stringent policies, procedures
and controls intended to insure full compliance with the
independence rules, we and our clients will benefit from the
additional measures we will take to make sure this does not happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the ethical lines for auditors have grown murky
because the independence rules were written many years ago and no
longer cover potential conflicts of interests created as the firms
have grown larger by offering a multitude of new consulting
services to their audit clients.
</P>
<P>
   But to even the newest recruit at the accounting firms, one rule
has always been clear: auditors cannot own even one share of stock
in companies they audit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is rule number one that you learn when you walk in the
door,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Paul R. Brown, an accounting professor at New York
University, ``It makes me wonder how such a basic independence rule
could have been breached.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you own even the smallest interest in an audit client,'' he
said, ``the perception might be that you are not independent.''
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the accounting firm said the problems came
about ``because a few individuals in Coopers &AMP; Lybrand's Tampa
office circumvented the firm's controls by withholding
information.'' And, in the case of the pension fund investments, it
said that ``required procedures were not followed.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the regulators' complaint, in December 1997, the
regional heads of the firm's tax and human resources departments
received an anonymous letter charging that a tax associate in the
firm's Tampa office had reportedly purchased the stock of three
audit clients.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's investigation found that the associate did own stock
in companies that he had performed services for. In one case, the
associate had worked on the company's audit at the time he owned
the company's stock. In the other two cases, he did not own the
stock at the same time that he was working on those companies'
matters.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators also found that another tax associate in the
Tampa office had owned stock in another company while working on
that company's audit and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC also found that from 1996 to 1998, five Coopers partners
had owned investments in 31 publicly traded companies that the firm
audited. The partners did not work on the audits of those
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the firm's pension plan had invested in dozens of
companies that were the firm's audit clients. Some of those
conflicts developed after Price Waterhouse and Coopers had merged.
While the firm's pension fund was managed by an independent
employee, the firm had failed to adequately monitor and control the
investments that were made, the regulators said.
</P>
<P>
   In settling the complaint, PricewaterhouseCoopers agreed to hire
an outside consultant to investigate whether there were any more
instances where the firm's professionals improperly owned
investments in audit clients. The firm also agreed to promptly
notify the chairman of a company's audit committee if an improper
investment was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting firm must also adopt new procedures and controls
including the creation of a new database to record and track the
personal investment portfolios of all partners and managers.
</P>
<P>
   And, it has agreed to pay $2.5 million into a fund that will be
used to educate the nation's auditors on the independence rules.

<P>
   Q: I'm being considered for a dream job _ and am fighting the
urge to shower my prospective boss with examples of my work,
glowing references and even small-caliber bribes. Friends tell me
that when it comes to job-hunting, there's no such thing as being
too eager. Is that true? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: No! It is a short hop from eager to pushy, and one that you
should avoid at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   The most stressful part of any job hunt is the waiting. Sure,
interviews can be unpleasant, but they don't give you that sense of
helplessness that sitting by the phone brings. Unfortunately, the
rules of the waiting game require you to do just that: Wait. And
patiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't overwhelm them with follow-up,'' said Barbara W.
Schaefer, senior vice president for human resources at the Union
Pacific Corp. in Omaha. Be sensitive to the fact that you are not
the hiring manager's only concern, she advised.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a person looking for a job, it's the single biggest thing
they're doing right then,'' Ms. Schaefer said. ``But to the people
doing the interviewing, it's one of 16 priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, if you come across as a pest during the interview
phase, prospective employers may fear that you'd be just as
annoying to have around the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ancient rule of job-hunting experts is that microcosm
equals macrocosm,'' said Richard Nelson Bolles, author of ``What
Color Is Your Parachute?'' (Ten Speed Press), a guide for job
seekers. ``The way you behave during the job hunt is taken by the
employer as a sign of how you'd behave on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   After the interviews, you have one significant follow-up shot: a
short letter. ``You must send a thank-you note,'' Bolles said; not
sending one, he added, has torpedoed the chances of many job
seekers.
</P>
<P>
   A note, of course, is good business etiquette, and it keeps your
name in front of the decision makers. You can also use it to blow
your own horn once more, said Edward N. Eisen, a career consultant
in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sum up the key points about what differentiates you, what
qualifies you for the position,'' Eisen said. ``Try to encapsulate
what it is that you would bring to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   (Again, however, respect the interviewer's time and keep the
letter brief. No one wants to slog through a 15-page treatise on
why you are the answer to her hiring prayers.)
</P>
<P>
   During the interview phase, the hiring manager should have made
it clear who should contact whom next _ and should have given you a
general idea of how long it will take to make a decision. But if
you don't hear back within that time frame, you can make a quick
call _ just to check in and to see if there is anything else you
should send.
</P>
<P>
   Such a call, however, should be made once and only once, Ms.
Schaefer cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   After that, there's nothing left to do but take up knitting,
judo or banjo lessons _ anything to keep your from just sitting and
glaring at the phone. &QL;

 MARKET PLACE: TREPIDATION AT KODAK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one sense, Thursday was an unusual day for Eastman Kodak Co.
About 8:30 a.m. _ an hour after it released its fourth-quarter
earnings but an hour before the New York Stock Exchange opened _
George Fisher, the company's chief executive, broke with his
tradition of refusing to forecast anything. He told analysts that
Kodak would earn $4.81 to $5.24 a share this year and would cut
$200 million more out of annual costs than the total of $1 billion
it had already promised to cut by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But in another sense, Thursday was business as usual _ or at
least the way business has been in this tumultuous stock market
environment. Kodak announced that its profits were up even though
its sales were down. Shareholders skidded right past the profit
rise, focused on the sales drop and spent the day dumping Kodak
stock. By the time the carnage was over, Kodak's stock had
plummeted $8.1875, or 10.4 percent, to $70.50.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak executives could be forgiven for an awful sense of deja
vu. A similar scene played out in October, when Kodak's shares
plunged more than 13 percent after shareholders ignored a profit
increase in the third quarter and focused on flat sales.
</P>
<P>
   But if shareholders were disappointed then, they are furious
now. Three months ago, Kodak's earnings were a penny above
analysts' expectations, and its cost-cutting regimen was ahead of
schedule. This time, analysts expected a lot more and Kodak
delivered a lot less.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Kodak's numbers were all that bad. The net
earnings for the quarter were $272 million, or 83 cents a diluted
share, a huge improvement from the loss of $744 million, or $2.29 a
share, it posted the last three months of 1997. Excluding charges,
Kodak clearly is in better shape than it was a year ago: earnings
of $1.05 a share compared with 75 cents a share in the quarter a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts had expected earnings of at least $1.15 a share and
were unprepared for the 6 percent drop in Kodak's revenue for the
quarter, to $3.56 billion, and the 8 percent decline, to $14.54
billion, for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bobbled the ball,'' Fisher acknowledged. Analysts were less
kind. ``They did a lot worse than bobble the ball, they fumbled
it,'' said Peter Enderlin, an analyst with First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even Kodak seems to be viewing 1999 with some
trepidation. Fisher's unexpected earnings forecast bracketed the
Wall Street consensus prediction of $5.19 a share this year. While
some analysts took his willingness to even suggest $5.24 as a sign
of optimism, far more took his pronouncement as an early alert that
Kodak might not even hit $5.19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without using the words, he is warning the Street that its
expectations are too high,'' said B. Alexander Henderson, an
analyst with Prudential Securities Research.
</P>
<P>
   If the next quarter looks anything like this one, it may be a
prudent warning. Kodak's woes sprang from so many places that they
approximated the proverbial death by a thousand cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, faltering economies in Brazil and Asia bit heavily
into sales, while a weak Mexican peso meant that robust Mexican
sales sounded meager in dollars. In Japan, where subcontractors
make Kodak's digital cameras, the strengthening yen drove Kodak's
digital losses, which had dropped to $52 million in the third
quarter, back up to $92 million the last three months. ``Our market
share grew, but that couldn't counteract the impact of the strong
yen,'' said Harry Kavetas, Kodak's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak and Danka Business Systems pretty much rewrote the 1996
agreement under which Danka sells Kodak copiers. But Danka still
owes Kodak millions of dollars, and few analysts expect Kodak will
ever see that money.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's much acclaimed cost-cutting program came up short in
December, too, in part because lower demand for film and copiers
drove down manufacturing volume. While Kodak cut annual costs by
$730 million in 1998, it cut only $80 million out of fourth-quarter
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, Kodak spent heavily to advertise its high-end Max
film while reducing prices on older Kodak Gold films. The moves
helped restore Kodak's share of the domestic film market to 70
percent, back from 67 percent in 1997, but ``the pricing pressures
pretty much offset any gains they got from cost-cutting,''
Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts think the price cuts were a smart
pre-emptory move. ``They are driving private-label manufacturers
out,'' said Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with Mercer, Bokert, Buckman
&AMP; Reid. Others note that the price cuts are a shot across the bow
of Kodak's archrival, Fuji Photo Film.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak has other bright spots looming. This year, it is expected
to finally introduce its program for using America Online to
deliver processed photographs electronically. It is also expected
to roll out Picture CD, a method for providing developed
photographs on compact disks.
</P>
<P>
   All told, few analysts took Kodak, despite its disappointments,
off their buy lists. In fact, many say that at the 14-times
estimated 1999 earnings it sells at, Kodak stock is a pretty good
buy. As Enderlin of First Albany put it, ``You can't not be bullish
when the stock's so cheap.''

NEW HOPE FOR NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Black and Hispanic students, who make up 75 percent of the
public school population in Boston, will be the main beneficiaries
of neighborhood schools if the Menino administration funds and
places them in a scrupulously fair manner.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, the Boston School Committee couldn't be
trusted with that task. The city was guilty of unconstitutional
segregation, leading to intervention by a federal court. The
current student assignment plan, which still relies on transporting
students across the city, is an extension of that degraded past.
Any Bostonian who believes that officially sanctioned racism abides
here permanently isn't likely to embrace neighborhood schools
again, seeing them as the road to inequality. But the local
landscape has been transformed.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike 20 years ago, tremendous capacity now exists in Boston's
minority neighborhoods. Public health institutions, community
development corporations, dynamic churches, youth crime experts,
business owners, and bankers are the norm in neighborhoods once
marked by disorganization and disinvestment. Community leaders know
the needs of individual families in their neighborhoods. Yet little
of this local expertise gets applied to education, because students
from distinctive neighborhoods so often go their separate ways to
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our youth workers are running all over the city,'' explains
Mark Scott of the Ella J. Baker settlement house in the Four
Corners section of Dorchester. ``We're too diluted.'' Scott wisely
wants to connect the activities of branch libraries, homework
centers, and community centers with the efforts of public
educators. That strategy requires foresight and proximity.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is showing more promise in residential integration than
in decades past. In Dorchester, Roslindale, Jamaica Plain, and
parts of South Boston, for example, neighborhood schools could also
be diverse, an important benefit. We hope the neighborhood school
effort takes root first in Boston's better-integrated communities.
In solidly black neighborhoods, like parts of Roxbury, or white
ones, like West Roxbury, it will be harder to achieve integrated
classrooms. A level of choice for parents needs to remain available
to ensure that families from any neighborhood can at least gain
access to open seats.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are right to be concerned, and vigilance will be the
price of equality. But public officials who would subvert the
educational advancement of minority students know that public
condemnation, the social disruption of the 1970s, and abundant
lawsuits would await them. Knowing that, it is time to rebuild
neighborhood schools in Boston, using local institutions as the
understructure.

 &HT;    Taking inventory of King
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Jennifer Ffrench-Parke
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The U.S. Park Service soon will begin what it calls a
``massive job'' of cataloging the contents of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr.'s family home.
</P>
<P>
   The work is a prelude to buying hundreds of King's personal
belongings that will be put on public display for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation for the inventory of King's possessions _ clothing,
family heirlooms, souvenirs and mementos _ gets under way as the
nation remembers the slain civil rights leader who would have
turned 70 today. King's birthday, observed internationally
throughout this weekend, culminates Monday with the King holiday
that is observed in every state but New Hampshire. Today through
Monday, about 10,000 people are expected to visit the King historic
district, an area headed for significant change.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service began talks with King's family last February to
buy the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change
Inc. complex of buildings, two other Auburn Avenue holdings held by
the family, and hundreds of personal possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is the family's Vine City home, near downtown
Atlanta. King's widow, Coretta Scott King, still lives there. But
the home is said to be just as it was the day King left for the
April 1968 Memphis trip on which he was shot.
</P>
<P>
   In March, six to 10 Park Service employees will take about a
month to inventory contents of the home at 234 Sunset Ave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every article of Dr. and Mrs. King will be listed,'' said
Frank Catroppa, superintendent of the Martin Luther King Jr.
National Historic Site. ``Every cuff link will be listed
separately.''
</P>
<P>
   Once completed, the home's contents will be appraised. Catroppa
said the negotiations should be finished by year's end and that he
expects to take all of 2000 to raise the funds for the purchase
from private sources and foundations.
</P>
<P>
   By 2001, visitors should be able to tour the King family home;
gawk at King's light blue 1960 Chevy Impala in the home's garage;
see the funeral wagon that carried his body through the streets of
Atlanta; and look at hundreds of other King memorabilia in newly
created display space in the King Center administrative building.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, the only display of King artifacts in the historic
district is a small collection of King's clothing and personal
items on exhibit in Freedom Hall at the King Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people make a beeline there to look at those items,''
said Catroppa, who runs the 23-acre King historic site, created by
an act of Congress in 1980. ``There is tremendous interest in the
possessions of Dr. King.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Park Service purchase, the items will go on public
display as part of the monument to the civil rights movement the
federal government is creating in Atlanta, a memorial expected to
have a tremendous impact on tourism and to increase Atlanta's draw
as a visitor destination.
</P>
<P>
   The historic Auburn Avenue district where King was born, spent
his boyhood years, preached and is buried, already attracts 500,000
visitors a year. Catroppa expects that number to double within a
couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. King, who was married to King for 11 years, reportedly kept
the family's home like a time capsule. Visitors say King's office
in a spare bedroom remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a pack rat and I say that lovingly,'' said Phillip
Jones, a family friend and Morehouse College chum of Dexter Scott
King, the Kings' fourth and youngest child. ``Her home is warm with
his memory. There is a haunting sense that Dr. King is there in
that home.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the sale is completed, Mrs. King, 72, will move out of the
modest 1960s red brick house she has lived in for more than 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said she is healthy and vigorous and that her children are
hoping to relocate her to a house where she can be comfortable.
``She has lived her entire life in a low-income community,'' he
said. ``We think we can find a nice home for her in the country
where she can enjoy her retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, management consultant with the for-profit Estate of
Martin Luther King Jr. Inc., said the King family is selling
buildings and possessions, but not the mission of the King Center.
</P>
<P>
   The center was launched in 1968 by Mrs. King in the aftermath of
her husband's assassination as ``a living memorial'' dedicated to
preserving his legacy. The work of the King Center - ``the
elimination of poverty, racism and violence'' - will remain with
the family and will continue under a new name, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Mrs. King retired from the day-to-day operations of the
King Center for which she had been president and chief executive
officer for 27 years. She relinquished control to Dexter Scott
King, now 37, but still travels the country to make speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter Scott King did not return telephone calls for this story.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the family home and burial wagon, the Park
Service hopes to acquire:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Birth Home, 501 Auburn Ave.
</P>
<P>
   _ The vacant houses on both sides of the Birth Home.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Administrative building of the Martin Luther King Jr.
Center for Nonviolent Social Change, 449 Auburn Ave.
</P>
<P>
   _ Freedom Hall, 449 Auburn Ave.
</P>
<P>
   _ Freedom Walkway and Chapel of All Faiths, 449 Auburn Ave.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said ``sacred items'' like the crypt and the eternal flame
will be donated to the Park Service. Once it takes possession, the
Park Service will restore the buildings and invest money every
couple of years for upkeep. The grounds of the King Center, for
example, are showing wear and tear. Last week, a large section of
broken pavement near the administrative building was cordoned off
with yellow police tape. In March, the Park Service is expected to
assume a 99-year lease on the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church
sanctuary. This is the building in which King went to Sunday School
as a child; was ordained in 1947; for a time shared pastoral duties
with his father and where his funeral took place on April 10, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   After the change of hands, the Ebenezer's congregation will move
across the street to a new $8 million sanctuary, next to the Park
Service Visitor Center.
</P>
<P>
   The sales talks are ongoing against a backdrop of shrinking
revenues at the King Center, which has operated in the red for much
of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The center's income shrunk from $4.9 million to $2.4 million
from 1993 to 1996, the last year for which information is
available.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the dwindling revenues should not be interpreted as a
loss of support for the center. ``He (Dexter) didn't go out to ask
for money,'' Jones said. ``He's been working on giving the King
Center a clear vision and on being more self-sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   The steepest declines coincided with Dexter Scott King's
assumption of the center's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he took over, he publicly butted heads with the
Park Service over competing plans for a King exhibit in the
historic district. Before the dispute was settled, the family
banned the Park Service from conducting tours of the King Birth
Home and drew public criticism for wanting to exploit King's work
for private profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service prevailed and completed its $11 million Visitor
Center at 450 Auburn Ave.
</P>
<P>
   Catroppa, who has drawn praises from Jones for building more
amicable relationships, said Park Service ownership of the
buildings and King artifacts will enable the Park Service to tell
``a broader story'' of the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will give us an opportunity to ... expand the story of the
Civil Rights Movement from slavery to today,'' Catroppa said.
``This is not a story that ended in 1968. It's a story that is
continuing and we want to bring it up to date.''

DELTA ADDS FEE FOR SEATS NOT BOUGHT ON ITS WEB SITE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Okla., Wash., N.Y., Texas)   (jw) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Starting this week, there are two new classes for Delta Air
Lines passengers: wired and unwired.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the rising cost of conventional booking methods, Delta is
imposing a surcharge _ $1 one way, $2 round trip _ on domestic
tickets purchased anywhere but on the airline's own Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   No other airline has yet followed suit, though United Airlines,
a subsidiary of the UAL Corp., said Thursday that it was studying
such a move.
</P>
<P>
   While travel agents acknowledge that the surcharge will not fall
on them directly, they contend that the airline's long-range
strategy is to further weaken travel agents, whose commissions have
been sharply cut by the carriers since 1995, by weaning customers
away altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here the airlines are making more money than they've ever
made,'' said Diane Hanmer, the owner of Diane's Travel in
Bartlesville, Okla., ``and they're penalizing the people who can't
afford a computer and the older generation, who aren't real
familiar with using it.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta declined to discuss the surcharge policy, though it said
that slightly less than 2 percent of its ticketing is now done
through its Web site (www.deltaairlines.com). United (www.ual.com)
said its Web site's share of its bookings was 1.5 percent, while
American Airlines (www.aa.com), a unit of the AMR Corp., said its
Internet bookings were just under 2 percent and growing by 25
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Jupiter Communications, a market research firm in New
York, has forecast that air travel bookings through the Internet
will grow to 8 percent ($7 billion) in 2002, from 2 percent in
1998. And as the electronic share of bookings grows, many agents
and travel industry officials say the major airlines are determined
not to yield that business to such Internet travel agencies as
Expedia, Preview Travel, Travelocity and Internet Travel Network,
whose sale of airline tickets is increasing steadily.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp., for example, said last week that its MSN
Expedia service (on MSN.com) posted sales of $250 million last year
_ mostly airline tickets _ a 150 percent increase over 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While that is minuscule compared with the airline industry's
$79.45 billion in revenues in 1997, the last year for which figures
are available, the Internet agencies' sales are expected to
continue growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airlines have been cutting commissions to travel agents for
years, long before online travel came on the scene,'' Suzi LeVine,
a product manager at MSN Expedia, said. ``This is another step in
that direction and ultimately against customers' ability to gain
access to a broad set of choices.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline industry has consistently denied any such intent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The two-tier Delta policy is reminiscent of Citibank's policy in
the early 1980s, in the early days of the automated teller machine,
of requiring a $5,000 minimum balance for customers at some
branches to be served by human tellers. At the same time, it
follows a trend in other services _ notably stock trading _ in
which online customers are offered lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   At the Satellite Airlines Center in New York City on Thursday,
Dr. Wilbur Bowne, who was booking a Delta flight to a meeting in
New Orleans, called the surcharge ``unfair to the customer.'' But
he also said that in the future he would use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Ward, a travel agent in Atlanta, Delta's corporate backyard,
said: ``I've been surprised by the ground swell of resentment
toward Delta. Two dollars for a round trip isn't much, but to a lot
of customers it's a lot like creeping taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   In Delta's message to travel agents on Monday, advising them of
its new policy, effective immediately, the company said its cost of
distributing tickets had increased more than 280 percent since
1990, to more than $1 billion in fiscal year 1998, while revenue
had grown just 50 percent over that same period.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it added, three of the four computer reservation
systems used by most airlines and travel agents had already
announced fare increases effective early this year. It said it
would not apply the surcharge to tickets from its Web site because
it was the least expensive way of issuing tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The expense of traditional ticketing has led the airlines in
recent years to encourage another electronic innovation, the
paperless ticket. But all tickets purchased through Delta's Web
site, whether traditional or paperless, will be exempt from its new
surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   The Travel Industry Association of America said that the number
of people who booked airline, hotel and rental car reservations on
the Internet increased 24 percent last year to 6.7 million, from
5.4 million in 1997. With sales of $816 million, according to
Jupiter, travel is the second-largest online industry, trailing
only PC hardware and software sales ($836 million).
</P>
<P>
   While slow to merchandise their own Web sites, airlines are
going all-out now to reap its presumptive riches.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years they have been adding not just bargain
fares available only on their Web sites, but discounts for hotels
and rental cars.
</P>
<P>
   They often give bonus frequent-flier miles to customers who book
on their Web site and frequent fliers can pay for certain bargain
flights for a nominal fee plus frequent-flier miles. Thus
Continental Airlines recently posted round-trip flights between
Houston and Newark and between Seattle and New York for $29 plus
17,500 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Many who book on airline Internet sites appear to be younger
passengers who have flown only infrequently in the past, the
airlines say, and have rarely if ever dealt with a travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   United said that 81 percent of its sales last year came through
travel agents.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, travel agents contend that booking directly with
airline Web sites will ultimately hurt consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will inevitably pay more,'' said Joe Galloway, the
president of the American Society of Travel Agents, ``since they
won't have the comparative fare and schedule options _ provided by
travel agents _ that can help them save hundreds of dollars, as
shown by every independent study.''

ARE COMPACT DISCS DETERIORATING WITH AGE? 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURA EVENSON and JAMES SULLIVAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who ran out and bought a copy of Billy Joel's ``52nd
Street'' _ the first mass-market compact disc, released in 1983 _
might want to pull it off the shelf and have a look. At least a few
CD technology skeptics say it could be full of holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average CD lasts only 15 years,'' says Steve Albini. A
Chicago recording engineer and front man for the band Shellac, his
controversial views, which aired earlier this month on the National
Public Radio show ``Anthem,'' prompted dozens of phone calls and
e-mail messages. ``It's an inevitable process of chemical
deterioration.''
</P>
<P>
   Since their introduction, compact discs have been touted as the
recorded format that can handle harsh treatment _ fingerprints,
scratches, peanut butter smears. But Albini, who has produced
records for Nirvana and Bush and mixed the recent reunion of Led
Zeppelin's Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, believes that CDs won't
withstand the simplest of tests: leaving them on the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that the aluminum used to make CDs deteriorates when
it is exposed to oxidizing agents, leaving the discs vulnerable to
``CD rot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you clean a vinyl record before you play it, keep
it away from heat and don't scratch it up, vinyl will last a
century or more,'' says Albini, who is known for his unrelenting
criticism of the music industry. ``With CDs, you can do everything
right, and they will last only a decade or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Albini's views, and the response they are generating, prove that
CDs remain a disputed medium among audiophiles. Few experts agree
with him completely, but many concede that CDs are not foolproof.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are destructible, no question,'' says George Horn,
manager of mastering at Berkeley's Fantasy Studios since 1980.
``People can damage them by handling and scuffing them, contrary to
what was said 15 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   What's most frustrating, says Horn, is the medium's built-in
process of ``interpolation,'' in which a glitch in the disc's
photosensitive layer causes the CD player to overcompensate,
leading to loss of sound quality and the occasional skip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Errors are always with us in the digital recording domain,''
Horn says.
</P>
<P>
   That's a potential problem for historical archives, Albini says,
many of which are now stored digitally on discs. He's especially
concerned that cultural ephemera, including taped political
speeches, commercial jingles and even some film scores, may not be
properly preserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a music fan and a professional recording engineer who
values history, I feel my job is to make sure that what we do stays
put and available to people for years into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   But the deficiency of store-bought CDs that Albini describes is
a problem that's been addressed, Horn says. ``It had to do with a
particular process that one of the manufacturers was using (in the
early years),'' in which the injection-mold process let in air,
oxidizing the aluminum of the finished product. ``It's really not a
problem anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   George Peterson, editor of Mix Magazine, an audio-industry
publication based in Emeryville, Calif., was an early naysayer of
CD technology. ``I was one of the first people to make public that
some CDs actually had mirror blackening, where the silver part
corroded like you see in mirrors.''
</P>
<P>
   But the recording industry has improved its manufacturing
process, Peterson says, making defective CDs a rarity. ``I haven't
seen one since.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, say they have. Rick Karr, co-host of
``Anthem,'' the weekly music magazine show, says the deterioration
of an older CD in his collection prompted him to invite Albini as a
guest on a show celebrating the 50th anniversary of vinyl.
</P>

   ``I bought this disc in the early 1990s by the band Big Star and
saw it turn brown. I've seen other discs over time grow more and
more prone to mistracking.''

   Mark Goorsky, an associate professor of material science and
engineering at the University of California at Los Angeles, says
that except for a few discs made cheaply by small labels, most
audio CDs and CD-ROMs are at least as hardy as any vinyl record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you have a really aggressive environment, with an
incredible amount of humidity, for example, I don't see how a CD
would deteriorate over time if it's just left alone,'' Goorsky
says. ``A lot of the big CD manufacturers are teaming up with big
plastic companies to make sure the discs are sealed and won't
darken over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, it's a moot point because the next technology coming
up will replace this one anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapid progression from one recording technology to another
is part of the problem, as Albini sees it. ``With each incremental
improvement in digital technologies, everyone wants to discard the
old one. So often the machines used to make and play back master
digital tapes no longer exist,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy's Horn disagrees that there's reason to fear for the
safety of digital archives. ``I don't think storage is a problem.
The U.S. Navy did tests, and they felt that CDs would last 100
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Moses Avalon, author of the new book ``Confessions of a Record
Producer,'' says the whole argument is relative. ``In any storage
medium there's a degree of risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Since CDs have been around for only 15 years, Avalon says, ``no
one, not even Sony or Philips, knows how long digital data can be
retained on the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say he's a fan of the technology. ``Producers
have hated the standard from the day we were handed it,'' Avalon
says _ for the medium's ``cold'' sound, not its possible longevity
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to place my bet in the cosmic casino on this, I'd say
CDs will not deteriorate.''

SPORTS COLUMN: JIMMY SHOULD FOLLOW HIS INSTINCTS
</HEADLINE>
 (also see FBN-DOLPHINS) 
(bl) 
By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is never a pretty sight when a grown man is stomping all over
a box of breakfast cereal, tossing Flutie Flakes around the room,
the way Jimmy Johnson did two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Football coaches will do almost anything to deliver a booster
shot to their beefed-up brutes. It is not a profession for the
ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   When they crash, they really go down in flames, like Dick
Vermeil saying he was ``burned out'' when he left the Philadelphia
Eagles in 1982, or Lou Holtz running out on the New York Jets with
a game left in the 1976 season, or Richard M. Nixon saying the
football writers wouldn't have him to kick around anymore, or maybe
I've got him confused with somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   Football coaches are a different breed, but even they sometimes
undergo the emotional loop-the-loop that led Johnson to plan his
resignation as coach of the Miami Dolphins late Wednesday, only to
resurface Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson coached the Miami Hurricanes, that most
professional of college teams, or the Dallas Cowboys, that adorable
bunch of cutups, his resolve was as crusty as the wave in his hair.
But something got through to Johnson. He says it was the death of
his mother, Allene, on Dec. 20, along with the fact that he chose
to coach the next night, causing him to arrive late for her funeral
back in Port Arthur, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's time you pull back and you say: `Be with people you
care about. Don't shortchange them,''' Johnson said Thursday.
``That's what I plan on doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Dave Wannstedt, recently dropped as coach of the
Chicago Bears, would be his assistant head coach next year, a
complicated arrangement to have made overnight, but whatever. And
it was a subdued Johnson who told reporters, Nixon-like, that they
would have him around for at least another year.
</P>
<P>
   This turnaround came after nine head coaching jobs became
available in recent weeks, four of them still unfilled. Marty
Schottenheimer, who has been known to weep at the sight of a pretty
sunset, fell on his own career sword after failing to make the
playoffs with Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The amazing thing is that football coaches come back, although
not overnight as Johnson did. Vermeil came back from his
self-described burnout to his unsuccessful term in St. Louis. Mike
Ditka was lumbering around like a wounded bull moose in Chicago,
but came back in New Orleans, with meager results. They were both
right the first time. Enough. Dog-track time, as radio personality
Don Imus likes to say.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anybody has come back like Bill Parcells. People forget
that Parcells turned down an assistant's job with the New York
Giants in 1979 because he didn't want to move his family from
Colorado Springs, Colo. He has since wondered how close he came to
football oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells moved his family to New England the next year, joined
the Giants as an assistant and has now taken the Giants to two
Super Bowl championships, the Patriots to one Super Bowl and the
Jets to Sunday's conference championship game in Denver. He also
had serious heart problems and needed to modify his exercise and
diet and give up smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The amazing thing about Parcells is that he has faced mortality
without surrendering the vast amount of self-assurance that it
takes to be a winning coach. You don't win rings with that
touchy-feely stuff. Ask Marv Levy, who read hard-cover books but
lost four Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was as steely as any of them, but a subterranean river
of emotion worked its way upward recently when his father came down
with cancer, and his mother died.
</P>
<P>
   After the Dolphins defeated Buffalo in the opening playoff
round, Johnson gleefully attacked the box of Flutie Flakes, never
thinking it through that the marketing was a way to raise money to
study and combat autism and that both Doug Flutie of the Bills and
Dan Marino of the Dolphins have autistic sons. Johnson gallantly
apologized to Flutie as soon as he understood the implications, and
there is no sense of whether Marino was also upset by the original
tantrum.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, Johnson's father, C.W. Johnson, openly admitted
his son had had enough coaching and would retire Thursday. But
Wayne Huizenga, the team owner, jetted back to Miami and helped
change Jimmy's mind, although Johnson did promise to find an extra
hour a day to have a life with his fiancee, Rhonda Rookmaaker. ``In
my early days, it cost me time with my two sons,'' Johnson said.
``It cost me a marriage. And I could see some of these same things
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   He probably should have gone through with his impulse to retire.
Once a football coach has misgivings, it is never the same.

 Healtheon Resurrects Its Plans for IPO  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Hoping to capitalize on the Internet stock frenzy, Healtheon Corp.
yesterday revived plans for an initial public offering, albeit a
scaled-back one.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clara company, chaired by Netscape Communications and
Silicon Graphics co-founder Jim Clark, provides software and
services that let doctors, hospitals and insurance companies share
patient information online for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon had been ready to sell a 12 percent stake in October,
but it pulled the IPO on October 20, after the stock market had
gone through the wringer.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the company planned to raise $51 million by selling
6.5 million shares at $6 to $8 each.
</P>
<P>
   But in documents filed yesterday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Healtheon now says it plans to raise just $35
million. It has not disclosed how many shares it will sell or what
price it will seek.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon's latest filing came just as the Dow Jones industrial
average fell 228.63 points yesterday, putting it about where it
started the year but still higher than it was in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the stock market down big time today and things looking
pretty ugly, who knows?'' said David Simons, managing director of
Digital Video Investments, a New York institutional research firm.
``They could find themselves with the window closed again. It could
have nothing to do with the merits of the company, just with
investors' appetite for IPOs.''
</P>
<P>
   The online health care market is getting increasingly crowded,
and Healtheon is one of many companies looking to cash in on
consumers' growing appetite for health services on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Investors keep a particularly close eye on the 470-person
company because of Clark's track record.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Internet firms, Healtheon has yet to turn a profit. In
yesterday's filing, the company revealed net losses of $35.6
million for the nine months that ended last September 30, compared
with $21.3 million lost in the first nine months of 1997. Revenues
grew to $33.2 million in the first nine months of 1998, a nearly
five-fold increase over the $7 million posted in the same period of
1997.

SHARES CONTINUE TO FALL; DOW DROPS 228.63 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks fell for a fourth consecutive session Thursday
as fears intensified that Brazil's financial turmoil, reflected in
the devaluation of its currency, might spread to other Latin
economies and dampen business with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Wednesday's session, when blue-chip stocks recovered more
than half of their losses during the day, prices rallied only
mildly in late trading Thursday, not enough to keep the Dow Jones
industrial average from slipping into negative territory for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is on the brink and Argentina may follow,'' said Neil
Eigen, managing director at J&AMP;W Seligman. ``The realization is
taking hold that the United States doesn't go it on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   As is usual on word of foreign distress, shares of banks and
other financial companies were prominent casualties because of
possibly soured loans and losses in securities trading. J.P. Morgan
lost 4 9/16 a share, to 102; Suntrust fell 3 9/16, to 72 11/16;
Chase Manhattan was down 3 3/8, to 68 1/4; Mellon dropped 3 1/4, to
65 1/8, and Citigroup fell 1 5/16, to 50 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also said the start of the impeachment trial of
President Clinton contributed to the wider market decline, noting
that the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which had stabilized
for more than 90 minutes, resumed its slump as television coverage
began at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took buyers away and brought in some nervous selling,''
said Fane Lozman of Scanshift, a research company in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   At the close, the Dow was at 9,349.56, down 228.63 points, or
2.44 percent, its worst point loss since Sept. 30. That brought the
two-day damage to 353.75 points, or 3.7 percent. The Dow is now
down six-tenths of 1 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 fell 22.21 points Thursday, or 1.8 percent, to
1,212.19, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 39.99 points, or
1.73 percent, to 2,276.82. The S&AMP;P 500 is down 1.39 percent for the
year, but Nasdaq is still up 3.84 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign markets, which were severely battered on Wednesday,
ended mixed, but Brazil's Bovespa suffered much of its pounding _
nearly 10 percent _ after European markets had closed.
</P>
<P>
   Market analysts said high valuations had made the market
particularly susceptible to shocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a market correction inspired by the Brazilian crisis,
added to by the presidential impeachment,'' said John Shaughnessy,
chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. in Boston. But he said
the pullback was probably healthy, ``squeezing euphoria out of the
market'' while not seriously threatening American business.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also took note of the very solid U.S. economy,
confirmed in Thursday's government reports of a surprisingly big
rise in retail sales for December and almost nonexistent consumer
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 30 component stocks of Dow industrials, the biggest
loser by far was Eastman Kodak, which plunged 8 3/16, to 70 1/2, as
the company posted fourth-quarter profits that were lower than
expected. Kodak accounted for more than 30 points of the drop in
the Dow, whose only gainer was General Electric, which rose 1/2, to
97 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   No major sectors escaped punishment, but some analysts said they
were impressed that high-flying Internet stocks, which have become
increasingly difficult to trade, held up relatively well.
</P>
<P>
   While Yahoo fell 23 15/16 a share, to 344 1/16, and Amazon.com
fell 10, to 138, other Internet stocks surged. Ebay and Ubid, two
auction companies, climbed; Ebay jumped 9 13/16 a share, to 225
5/16; Ubid rose 3 7/16, to 91 1/2. America Online, another recent
star, eased 1 1/4, to 144 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   And the Russell 2000, an index comprising small-company stocks,
was 1.12 percent lower, less than half the decline of the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered
advancers by 2,161 to 903.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Brazil's meltdown, stocks in Mexico rose 1.7 percent
Thursday after nine consecutive sessions of declines. Markets also
rose in Tokyo, by 2.5 percent, and Paris by nearly 1 percent.
Stocks fell by 1.59 percent in Frankfurt, five-tenths of 1 percent
in London and eight-tenths of 1 percent in Hong Kong.

 Manager Worries About How to Retain Workers  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I'm a manager at a firm that has experienced 28 percent
turnover of its staff for each of the past two years. I'm trying to
convince the folks at the top that this is a problem, and that they
should take some steps to retain people. Can you tell me what
typical turnover rates are at other companies? And is there any
standard figure on how much it costs to fill each empty position?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  You're asking some good questions. In today's
low-unemployment economy, managers everywhere are worrying about
how to hold on to their people.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there's no simple answer. Turnover rates vary
widely by industry and job: For instance, fast-food restaurants
have much higher turnover than government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Ware, a retention consultant with Integral Training Systems
in Half Moon Bay, says that turnover rates of more than 15 percent
can be a sign that something's wrong with an organization.
BankAmerica chief executive Hugh McColl told The Chronicle this
week his company's turnover rate is 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turnover ratios in the 'teens, while not good, are common,''
said Barry Lawrence of the Society for Human Resource Management.
``When you get into the high 20s, that's getting a little severe.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the cost of replacing people?
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, it's getting common to say that replacement costs
are anywhere from one to three times the salary of the person who
left,'' said Patrick Shannon, a consultant with William M. Mercer
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   That means losing one $60,000-per-year computer programmer could
cost you anywhere from $60,000 to $180,000.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds jarringly high. But such figures include direct
costs such as headhunter fees, help-wanted ads and hiring temps to
fill in while the job is open.
</P>
<P>
   They also include indirect costs such as the time that
supervisors spend screening job applicants, and the loss of
productivity as new hires learn the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   You're smart to call your company's attention to the issue of
turnover. But don't rely just on the raw data _ use exit interviews
with your departing employees to find out why so many are jumping
ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more quantified data that can be presented to senior
management, the better,'' Ware said. ``Show them not just how many
people are leaving, but who is leaving, why they're leaving, and
where they're going.''
</P>
<P>
   Refusing W-2
</P>
<P>
   Q: I worked for a man from August 1997 until March 1998, when he
went out of business. Taxes were deducted from my paycheck the
entire time, and I received a W-2 form for 1997. The problem lies
with those three months in 1998: Although my boss kept deducting
taxes from my checks, he never deposited the money with the IRS.
Now he's refusing to give me a W-2 for my work in 1998. He instead
claims that I was an independent contractor and says I should pay
the taxes myself. I have no check stubs showing that he already
deducted taxes, since it was a small business and he just wrote out
a regular check. What should I do?
</P>
<P>
   A: Employers can't simply decide to switch people from employee
to contractor status on a whim, or because the company happens to
be a little short on payroll cash.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of WORKWAYS () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Nor can employers simply decide to stop depositing the taxes
they've withheld from their employees' paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot? Your boss is going to end up in hot water with the
IRS and state tax authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was actually stealing from her by withholding money from
her paycheck and not giving it to the government,'' said Jesse
Weller, a Northern California spokesman for the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you need to do to straighten things out:
</P>
<P>
   _Send your boss a certified letter right now asking for a W-2
for 1998. Keep a copy, so you can prove that you asked for the
form.
</P>
<P>
   _File an SS-8 form with the IRS asking them to verify that you
were an employee during 1998, not an independent contractor.
</P>
<P>
   _Call the IRS at (800) 829-1040 and report that your old boss
wasn't making the required tax payments.
</P>
<P>
   _If he hasn't issued you a W-2 by February 15, call that same
number and file a formal complaint about nonreceipt of your W-2.
</P>
<P>
   When the time comes to file your own tax returns this spring,
the IRS may not yet have ruled on your employee/contractor status
or forced your boss to give you a W-2. If that's the case, file a
Form 4852 _ a substitute W-2 form that will tell the IRS that you
had taxes withheld from your pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This exact problem happened to me 20 years ago,'' Weller said.
``I filed a 4852 and got credit for the taxes that were withheld.''
</P>
<P>
   Some other tips: Pull together as much evidence as you can to
document that your job and pay were the same in 1998 as they were
in 1997, when you were treated as an employee.
</P>
<P>
   And make sure you notify state tax authorities and the U.S.
Social Security Administration as well as the IRS that your boss
neglected to deposit the taxes he withheld. If he was skipping IRS
payments, it's a good bet he was skipping payments to these other
agencies too.
</P>
<P>
   In California, you should call the Franchise Tax Board about
state income tax payments, and the Employment Development
Department about state unemployment and disability insurance
payments.
</P>
<P>
   And call the California Labor Commissioner at (415) 557-7878 to
file a complaint about your boss' failure to provide paycheck
stubs.
</P>
<P>
   Section 226 of the California Labor Code requires employers to
provide a written record of gross wages, net wages and hours worked
with every paycheck, either on a stub or on a separate piece of
paper. Violators face hefty fines of $250 for each paycheck where
they don't provide this data _ and $1,000 per paycheck if they
violate this regulation again in the future.

 Mobile Dentist Comes to Your Workplace  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Adam Prevost was used to being able to do personal errands at work.
After all, his company had an on-site gym, dry cleaner, post office
and shoe repair business.
</P>
<P>
   But Prevost was still a little skeptical about the idea of
getting his teeth cleaned in a Winnebago in the company parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was slightly apprehensive: a dentist's office in a van?''
said Prevost, manager of direct marketing at Siemens Information
and Communication Networks in Santa Clara. ``But I looked around
and saw the PCs (that show instant color photos of patients' teeth)
and I said, `That's a first!' Within five minutes, I was won
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Prevost is a patient of On-Site Dental Care _ a
first-of-its-kind firm based in Palo Alto that provides mobile
dental care at about 20 Silicon Valley workplaces such as Netscape
Communications, 3Com Corp. and Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   For years, dentists have outfitted vans to bring dental care to
poor, under-served areas like American Indian reservations and
inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   But On-Site Dental is the first time that anyone has used mobile
dental facilities to meet the needs of employees who are simply too
busy to go to a traditional dental office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to provide the highest quality of dentistry while
saving patients and their companies tremendous time traveling to
and from the dentist,'' said Dr. Arnold Keiles, the dentist who
founded and runs On-Site.
</P>
<P>
   On-Site Dental is the latest in an array of ``concierge''
benefits offered by many big Silicon Valley companies.
</P>
<P>
   Valley firms compete fiercely for employees. They also often
place grueling demands on their employees' time, expecting them to
work around the clock during deadline crunches.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many firms have invited outside vendors to their
office complexes to provide workers with everything from espresso
and dry cleaning to oil changes and video rentals.

 &QL; 
 &LR;  The goal? Keep employees busily working in their cubicles rather
than sitting in the valley's infamous traffic jams en route to
errands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is considered gold in today's working environment,'' said
Christine Wilcome, facilities administration manager at Adaptec in
Milpitas, which started using On-Site this month. ``I really want
to keep our employees productive. And &LR;   &LR; we get savings on
productivity when employees don't have to take half a day off to
travel to the dentist and sit in a waiting room.''
</P>
<P>
   On-Site is the brainchild of Keiles, a 30-year veteran dentist
who had watched his patients become increasingly pressed for time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, a lot of patients couldn't keep appointments
because they were too busy or couldn't get away from work,'' Keiles
said. ``I came up with the back-to-the-future idea of house
calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Keiles' four vans are anything but old-fashioned. Each
40-foot-long facility is equipped with state-of-the-art digital
X-ray equipment; an intra-oral camera that can produce instant
color photos of patients' mouths; cellular and land-based phone
equipment; a server and three workstations; and either VCRs or
virtual reality glasses that let patients watch movies during
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Each van costs about $350,000 and has the potential to produce
$600,000 in annual revenues, according to Keiles.
</P>
<P>
   Keiles _ who quietly launched On-Site two years ago at just two
corporate sites _ plans to have six vans in the field by the end of
this month and 12 by the end of this year. He hopes to start
turning a profit in the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of DENTAL15 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Looking further down the road, Keiles' goal is to take the
company public within two years and have 75 to 100 vans serving
major business areas around the United States within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its unique mobile nature, On-Site's fees and billing
arrangements are similar to traditional dental practices.
</P>
<P>
   On-Site takes patients covered by dental indemnity insurance
plans like Delta Dental. There is no extra cost to the patient or
company: The only things a client firm must provide are a parking
spot, phone lines and an electrical hook-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very important to me,'' said Wilcome, ``since with
the business environment in the valley now, costs are something we
have to keep an eye on.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers caution that On-Site's growth could be limited by
the kinds of insurance it accepts. Keiles won't accept dental HMO
plans, only indemnity plans. So employers who are trying to save
money by using dental HMOs wouldn't be able to use On-Site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way he'll be able to get patients away from
traditional dentists is by convenience, not by cost,'' said Bob
Burnett, a health and welfare benefits expert with Buck Consultants
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But convenience can be a big selling point _ especially in
high-pressure work environments like Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Moessner has used On-Site five or six times, including
visits to pull a tooth and get a crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service is better than going to an outside dentist because
you don't have the waiting time,'' said Moessner, a benefits
representative at Space Systems/Loral in Palo Alto. ``If they're
running late, they just call you. You can stay at your desk and
keep working until they're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of DENTAL15 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Prevost, the Siemens manager, has had four crowns put in by
On-Site. He also had a more complicated root canal done at Keiles'
regular office in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   How did Prevost end up with so much dental work to do?
</P>
<P>
   Partly because, until On-Site arrived, his 70-hour workweeks
made it easy to postpone going to the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a pain to leave work and go to the dentist,''
Prevost said. ``I knew I had stuff to do, but I wasn't real
proactive in getting it done. ... Now, having it at the company is
great. Everything is right there, even X-rays, and there's no
waiting.''

 Sharper Image Insiders Know When to Sell  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
You can say one thing about the insiders at Sharper Image,
including chief executive Richard Thalheimer, they are sharp enough
to know when to sell.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of an Internet-jazzed holiday season, management
sold almost a half-million shares of their stock.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it was a rare opportunity. For much of this decade,
Sharper Image has been nothing but fuzzy and dull. Its merchandise
mix has missed, and its stock has lagged. But lo and behold, the
online investment world discovered that the San Francisco retailer
sold stuff over the Internet and, bingo, its stock caught fire,
rising briefly above $20 a share. That's a far cry from September 1
when it reached a 52-week low of $2.50 a share, and November 19
when it traded as low as $5 a share.
</P>
<P>
   But Net mania changed all of &LR; that. Taking advantage of what was
considered the first Internet Christmas, Sharper Image published a
press release on November 30 to tout its stellar sales over the
critical Thanksgiving weekend. It reported that total revenues were
up 50 percent compared to the same period a year earlier, thanks in
part to online orders from its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The result: dot-com madness blew in like an arctic blast.
Sharper Image shares soared to their 52-week high of $21.19 that
same day.
</P>
<P>
   The full bounce didn't last very long. The retailer's shares
plunged nearly seven bucks the following day.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the net benefit from early holiday sales results was a
stock price that was more than triple what it was about two weeks
prior, closing at $17 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   So, what did you expect any self-respecting insider to do? Why,
dump shares, of course. Five top executives and a board member at
Sharper Image, including Thalheimer, unloaded more than 473,900
common shares of Sharper stock in December, according to filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the brass, including Chief Financial Officer Tracy Wan
and Chief Operating Officer Barry Gilbert, totally liquidated their
stakes in the company. As for Thalheimer, the CEO, he sold about
284,000 indirectly-owned shares between December 1 and December 29
at prices ranging from $13.42 to $16.58 per share. Thalheimer's
indirect stake was about 4.3 million shares after the transactions.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STREET15 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  What's more, a trust in his name unloaded 60,750 shares between
December 1 and December 29 at prices ranging from $13.00 to $16.58.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, investors would view such pragmatic profit-taking by
the CEO with disdain. But in the case of Thalheimer, selling turns
out to be a good thing for shareholders because he owns too many
shares. He has controlled more than 60 percent of the 8.7 million
shares outstanding, which makes for a rather illiquid stock. And
that practically prevents most institutional investors from wanting
to take positions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Thalheimer sold off shares earlier in the fourth
quarter, and Wall Street applauded the move. Thalheimer could not
be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good news. You would expect him to sell (at those share
prices,`` says analyst Alan Davis of Red Chip Review in Portland,
Ore., a small-cap research firm.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the selling by other insiders was, by no
means, a positive signal to outside investors, Davis says.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, one of few analysts who follow the small-cap stock,
recommended it as a buy in early November based on changes in
merchandise and the opening of new stores. Sharper Image's
same-store sales, a key retail benchmark, climbed about 8 percent
in December _ demonstrating some fundamental improvement in
operations and strategy, Davis says.
</P>
<P>
   However, he notes, that online shopping hype is responsible for
the lofty share price, noting only 5 percent of the company's
revenues come from Internet-generated sales.
</P>
<P>
   And the hype isn't over. Sharper Image issued a press release on
Monday declaring that it had created an auction function to its Web
site. But Davis says the new wrinkle is merely an inventory
management vehicle and will not compete with established Net
auctioneers eBay or OnSale. Nonetheless, Sharper's shares still
soared $8.25 on the news. ``Coming out with a press release calling
it an auction site is curious,'' Davis says. ``(But) it's
definitely going to hurt the stock.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WALL STREET WEST: &LR;  Within just a few days of each other, two of
Wall Street's more prominent prognosticators will have graced the
Bay Area with their presence. Today, the doyenne of the current
bull market, Abbie Cohen of Goldman, Sachs will address the Bay
Area Council Outlook Conference in San Jose. Cohen, who is so
closely watched that she can make news with the drop of a salad
fork, recently pared back her portfolio's stock allocation by 2
percentage points to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter strategist Byron
Wein made a pilgrimage to Nob Hill to address a local confab of
financial analysts. Wein is famous for his top 10 predictions for a
new year. My favorite for 1999: President Clinton will resign and
Geraldo Rivera's cable show will get canned, but Geraldo lands on
his feet with a new program: ``Larry Flynt Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Outlandish? Maybe. But Wein batted .600 in 1998.

 &HT;    Yawns greeting Tyson-Botha
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ There is no line at the ticket window, the men who
count pay-per-view receipts suddenly have taken the approach that
financial projections represent all that is evil and promoters were
so desperate to create a stir this week that they staged a Mike
Tyson camp member getting arrested.
</P>
<P>
   There's no buzz. There's barely a ``bu...''
</P>
<P>
   This is Mike Tyson week, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I drove in from the airport, I thought, `What the heck is
going on? Are they having a bowling tournament here?' '' said
long-time boxing trainer Lou Duva. ``Usually, even a week before a
Tyson fight, there's a huge scene. You know how you can tell? How
many hookers and pimps are outside. But all I saw were dentists.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since June 28, 1997, Tyson, boxing's king of
``cha-ching,'' will climb into a boxing ring Saturday night, an
event made more noteworthy by the fact the ring is at the MGM
Grand. The hotel and casino has not hosted a fight since Tyson took
a chunk out of Evander Holyfield's ear in their heavyweight title
rematch, an ending that not only sparked a melee between camp
members in the ring but touched off a riot in the casino.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds of gunshots were heard in the casino, causing panic among
the guests. To this day, hotel officials deny any shots were fired,
attributed the sounds to either a popping champagne bottle or a
large ashtray falling on a marble floor (depending on the
interview). Regardless, the casino was evacuated for two hours on a
weekend night, costing potential millions in gambling revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The night punctuated a disastrous, six-fight, $30 million deal
that the MGM had signed with Tyson and his former promoter Don
King. The contract, in effect, gave King the live gate for every
fight. The MGM's revenue would be generated by the increase in
casino business fight week. But the MGM not only had to clear the
house one night, it lost several of its high-roller customers who
were turned off by the crowd Tyson fights attracted. The MGM became
known in Las Vegas as the popular spot for drug dealers and gang
leaders. It didn't help when rap star Tupac Shakur was shot in his
car moments after leaving a Tyson fight at the MGM.
</P>
<P>
   When Tyson had his boxing license revoked, the MGM seized the
moment as a chance to get out of its final contracted fight with
King. Indications from the hotel was that it was out of the boxing
business. Nineteen months later, Tyson is back, fighting the
obscure Francois Botha. But the MGM Grand Garden, which in the past
had bodies in all 16,325 seats, is expected to be half-empty. The
casino has been short of customers this week. And some now wonder
if Tyson, who has accounted for seven of the top 10 pay-per-view
events, has lost his gate appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quiet, there's no question,'' said Marc Ratner, the
executive director of the Nevada Athletic Commission. ``But this is
new time.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways. Tyson's official purse for the Holyfield rematch
was $30 million. Saturday it is $10 million, although he also will
get a percentage of pay-per-view sales that could push his take to
$17 million and enable him to pay off most of a $13 million tax
debt and a $4 million judgment won by former trainer Kevin Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   Also new is the MGM's attitude. Hotel officials now blame the
negative element in the casino during Tyson fights on King, not the
boxer _ although one would've been hard pressed to hear someone
say, ``I'm here to watch Don King promote.'' MGM senior vice
president Don Welsh, who has scaled official ``capacity'' for this
fight down to 14,000, said of re-signing Tyson, ``If we had not
gone after him, somebody else would have.''
</P>
<P>
   All parties say they expected sluggish ticket sales because high
rollers traditionally come to Las Vegas for New Year's and the
Super Bowl. ``It's hard to get people to come back in between,''
Showtime executive Jay Larkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Even next week, an off week for the NFL playoffs, would have
been better. But next Saturday's PPV slot was locked up by the
George Foreman-Larry Holmes fight, which since has fizzled.
Preferred dates in February or March were filled, respectively, by
Oscar De La Hoya and Holyfield fights. Tyson could not wait until
April because of his tax debt.
</P>
<P>
   More problems: Michael Jordan's retirement steered attention
away from Wednesday's final news conference and even prompted Good
Morning America to push back its interview with Tyson by two days.
Tyson's ``muzzling'' at the breakfast and the lack of the bombastic
King made for a dull event.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin remains confident but refuses to speculate on the number
of people who pay $49.95 for pay per view. ``There's no hidden
agenda. It's just a waste of time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the name ``Tyson'' can't carry a show for the first time,
it could have a profound effect on the sport, the industry and the
casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a test case,'' Duva said. ``If Tyson comes out and
looks sensational, it could revive everything.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, the MGM will go from gunshots to silence.

 &HT;    A kinder, gentler Cunningham
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINTER PARK, MINN. _ Even after he left the game and became a
laborer in Las Vegas, there was an emptiness in Randall
Cunningham's 13-year NFL career, a hole the size of a championship
ring. So when the Minnesota Vikings offered him a contract after he
elected to make a comeback, he took as long answering them as it
takes to dust an empty trophy case.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for him, he refused more money from the lowly and
quarterback-starved New Orleans Saints to come to Minnesota.
Vikings coach Dennis Green saw him as the ideal complement to Brad
Johnson. Cunningham was experienced, athletic and willing to accept
a role as a backup.
</P>
<P>
   However, not even Cunningham anticipated how this season would
unfold for him. Nobody did
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings need a victory against the Falcons in Sunday's NFC
Championship Game to get to the Super Bowl, and no one's more
responsible for Minnesota's situation than Cunningham. His
statistics for the season are sparkling: 3,704 yards, 61 percent
completion rate, 34 touchdowns against 10 interceptions, 106 passer
rating.
</P>
<P>
   All of that from a guy who walked away from the game in 1995
after a credible but uneven career with the Philadelphia Eagles. He
sat out the '96 season, but a series of events _ including an
encounter with former NBA star Michael Jordan _ led him back.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham ran into Jordan in Santa Barbara, Calif., when he was
retired, and they played golf. At one hole, Jordan pulled out a
cigar. Someone asked him what kind it was, and Jordan said: ``It's
a championship cigar. Randall wouldn't know anything about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan then smiled and Cunningham said he took M.J.'s words to
heart. ``That kind of sparked me,'' Cunningham, 35, said. The
bigger factor, he said, was being told by God to restart his
career. ``He put it in my heart, and that's what I did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And so, he began working out to remove a gut he said developed
around his waist. But he credits maturity and a spiritual
foundation for his remarkable turnaround. Cunningham exudes a poise
and confidence that permeates his team. As explosive as the
record-setting offense is, the leader works with coolness.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably the biggest difference in me,'' he said. ``I
think the calmness just comes from maturity and having an inner
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   That inner peace is derived from his Christian beliefs. He
accepts no responsibility for his personal success. ``It all goes
to God, who strengthens me,'' Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, Cunningham relied on Cunningham to get it done,
passing and running. He was the 1990 NFL Player of the Year. But
the Eagles did not win, and Cunningham took the blame. Now, he is
on a team that shares the success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had success in the past, and I have failed in the
past,'' he said. ``This time, I am trying to take it in more of a
mature way. Not that it was terrible, but I couldn't bear any more
in (Philadephia). I think it was too rough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing seems too rough for Cunningham now. He has two Pro Bowl
receivers, Cris Carter and rookie Randy Moss. Third receiver Jake
Reed and tight end Andrew Glover are strong performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randall's recognition of different situations on the field is
the big thing about him,'' Glover said. ``He has weapons, but you
have to get the ball to them, know which one to go to in a certain
situation. And he's been great at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most remarkable about Cunningham is that coach Dennis Green
brought him in as insurance for Johnson. But when Johnson got hurt
early this season, Cunningham stepped in and took over. ``I thought
he would be the best backup in the league,'' Green said. ``I didn't
anticipate him playing so much. But we have a system that we
believe in. He's one of the most talented guys out there, and the
system has held up again. If it worked for others like Sean
Salisbury, Randall Cunningham _ who is extremely talented _ would
have great success.''
</P>
<P>
   It's come after a period of self-doubt. ``(In '96), I basically
lost the faith in my ability and lost the faith in playing,''
Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   But from where he's come, the rewards are that much more
satisfying. ``To get up at 6 and go fill up a truck with tile and
marble and granite? And then take the stuff to a crew and do the
drilling? Let me tell you: That will make you appreciate anything
you have.''

</P>
<P>
   OK, they're the same guy. The former Geoff Bodine has reinvented
himself for the 1999 Winston Cup season. He has a new car, the No.
60 Chevrolet; a new team, Power Team Racing, owned by Busch driver
Joe Bessey, and a new name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Geoffrey,'' he said on Thursday when the Charlotte Motor
Speedway Media Tour stopped at the Bessey shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came into Winston Cup racing, I was the only
Geoff out there,'' Bodine said. ``That lasted for quite a while.
But here lately there seems to be several other Geoffs out there.
Of course, they spell their name with a `J.' I still spell it with
a G.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother's always called me Geoffrey, and I just thought it
was a good way to separate myself from the other Jeffs by going to
my full first name, spelled with a G, like my mother has always
yelled at me with.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it should help him mostly on race day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty confusing,'' Geoffrey said. ``You're walking
down pit row, all the race fans are yelling and screaming, they
want your autograph and somebody yells, `Jeff.' And four Jeffs turn
around. You don't know who they're wanting. This way when they
yell, `Geoffrey,' I know it's going to be me.''
</P>
<P>
   Until catching on with Bessey, Bodine wouldn't have cared what
people called him, as long as they called. He had dissolved his
operation as an owner and had been dismissed as driver of the No. 7
Ford after getting one top-five and five top-10 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it could be over, because all around me teams were
shutting down, sponsors were going away, opportunities were going
away,'' Bodine said. ``There's too many drivers and not enough
teams, and I thought I could be left out. ... But this opportunity
came along, and it's a better opportunity than I ever could have
dreamed to have or put together.''
</P>
<P>
   Bessey put together this team in 30 days, buying equipment and
hiring help from the former Stavola Brothers operation. He'll
continue to drive the No. 6 Chevrolet in the Busch series.
</P>
<P>
   It's Busch, not bush
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR announced an ambitious marketing program to elevate its
Busch series.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have referred to the Busch series as Triple-A,
like the minor leagues in baseball,'' NASCAR's Kevin Triplett said.
``We are taking a lot of steps to change that perception.''
</P>
<P>
   The Busch series is NASCAR's second-biggest property, behind
Winston Cup. According to NASCAR, it has experienced a 286 percent
growth in attendance during the last 10 years. It has gone from
races in 14 states in 1995 to 20 states in 1999. Its TV ratings are
better than all other forms of racing other than Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest difference will be in prize money. Sponsor
Anheuser-Busch has increased its points fund from $650,000 to $1.5
million. The schedule is increased to 32 races, opening Feb. 13 at
Daytona and ending Nov. 13 at Homestead, Fla.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   To Phil Simms, the view from high above a stadium is the Rosetta
Stone of football analysis, a key to his game preparation as CBS's
top National Football League analyst. From that vantage point,
Simms distills the slants, schemes, stunts and rotations of 22
players into comprehensible nuggets of commentary.
</P>
<P>
   The faraway angle is not sexy enough to be used much during
games. As the football equivalent of learning grammar, it can be
boring, but it reveals the structure of the sport. To Simms, the
``all 22s'' explain why a quarterback threw an interception, why a
sweep succeeded or why a cornerback was beaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching it changes your perspective,'' he said Monday as he
prepared at home in Franklin Lakes, N.J., to broadcast the American
Football Conference championship game Sunday between the New York
Jets and the Denver Broncos. ``It makes you understand so you don't
have to take what's in the papers as right or wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms stood 6 feet from a big-screen television in his family
room, a remote control in his right hand, playing and replaying the
``all 22s'' tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the ultimate trick,'' he said, as he focused on the
reverse that Jets receiver Keyshawn Johnson ran for a touchdown
last Sunday against Jacksonville. ``Look. Two receivers up top.
Tight. It's third-and-8. The defense expects a pass. They're
saying, `Don't get picked off.' The Jets send the big glug, Kyle
Brady, in motion. The offensive line to the left goes right, the
line to the right goes left. Do you know how often you have to meet
to coordinate this?''
</P>
<P>
   The touchdown pass to the Jaguars' Jimmy Smith that ended the
first half also fascinated Simms. How could it happen? How could
the Jets' secondary stumble so badly, reversing the momentum that
had put the Jets ahead, 17-0?
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety didn't get wide enough,'' Simms said. ``That's
Jerome Henderson. Look at him. Oh my gosh. Wait. Look. It looks
like Henderson is mesmerized by the slot guy. See, he's looking in
at that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms loves parsing the ``all 22s'' to find something that
tighter angles can't show. He may not find a way to use his
discoveries because, as with other elements of an analyst's
preparation, he can't use it all. An analyst is lucky to use 10
percent of the analysis and anecdotes assembled before a game.
</P>
<P>
   The 88-yard kickoff return by the Jaguars' Reggie Barlow in the
third quarter last Sunday showed something unseen in the many other
angles available on the telecast, a nuance of body language by
Barlow before his long jaunt began.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a trick play,'' Simms said. ``Look. He's going to fake
a pass. See, one of the Jets is pointing. He's pointing. He sees
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dissecting the game with the ``all 22s'' enhances the full-field
view that is required for good analysis. If an analyst cannot read
the broad interaction of the offense and the defense rapidly and,
in 20 seconds or less, describe how a halfback wriggled through a
hole for a 60-yard gain, he's in the wrong job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can perpetually see the offense, so I watch the defense,''
said Simms, who spent his New York Giants career watching other
defenses. ``I see the tackling. I see the coverage. Once I see the
formations, it pretty much tells me what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms, 42, is in his fifth season of television work, after a
15-year career with the Giants. He began as a studio analyst for
ESPN, moved to NBC for three seasons, then was hired by CBS when
the network reacquired the AFC television package that NBC had
carried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot about analyzing film from doing the studio at
ESPN,'' he said. ``It taught me to condense my thoughts. On TV, you
have to talk in abbreviated sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   Sessions with the media coach Andrea Kirby ``turned on a light
about how to prepare.'' And in discussions with other announcers,
like Jets coach Bill Parcells, who worked for NBC in 1991 and 1992,
Simms learned more about what to say and when to say it. ``Bill
said, `Simms, you'll see everything from the booth, but what are
you going to choose to say?'''
</P>
<P>
   Simms has been able to speak more this season at CBS, working
beside Greg Gumbel, than in the past three seasons, when he shared
booth time with NBC's Dick Enberg and Paul Maguire. Analyzing from
a two-man booth ``can only have helped him tie things together from
play to play and series to series,'' Gumbel said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Simms: ``I still prepare the same way as I did when I
worked with Paul, but now I can say them instead of sharing them.
With Paul, I could take a sip of a drink and not have to fight him
on every point.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Maguire is with ESPN and Enberg is not calling NFL games.
And the most enduring football relationship for Simms is the one he
has with Parcells, his former Giants coach. At NBC, Simms called
New England games when Parcells coached there, and at CBS, he has
called Jets games.
</P>
<P>
   Simms loves talking about Parcells and is often asked to
interpret the Tao of Tuna. The day after the Jets beat Jacksonville
by 34-24, Simms surmised that Parcells would stress the mistakes
made but not excoriate the Jets for them. ``He's not dealing with a
hardened team,'' he said. ``We beat the 49ers, 49-3, in a playoff
game in '87, and he was a raving lunatic because I took four shots
in the head. `You'll get my quarterback killed!'''
</P>
<P>
   They have used each other as comic foils as co-hosts of the
half-hour Sunday morning Jets shows on a local New York station.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think he's a mean guy,'' said Simms, rifling through a
stack of cards with his handwritten notes. ``But did you know that
Bill puts rocks in his shoes so he can be more ornery? Can you
believe it?''
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's taping of the local ``Jets Kickoff'' program, some
of the best moments occurred off camera. A joke by Simms made
Parcells laugh so hard, he buried his reddened face in his hands
and needed his makeup retouched.
</P>
<P>
   They discussed Mike Holmgren's contract as the new coach,
general manager and executive vice president of the Seattle
Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's some fancy one in Seattle, $4.2 million for eight
years,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ante is going up,'' Simms said. ``I say the next coach
that's like Holmgren will get $10 million. It's going so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't going to be me, Simms,'' said Parcells, who has four
years left on his Jets contract. ``You can write that down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, I believe you,'' his former quarterback said.
</P>
<P>
   And Parcells thought of a reason he wants to beat Denver on
Sunday. The losing coaches in the conference championship games are
the Pro Bowl coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to coach the Pro Bowl, I'll throw up,'' he said,
then asked, ``How much would they fine me if I didn't go?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot,'' Simms said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is apt that in the most important game of his
two-season overhaul of the Jets, Parcells, the teacher who thrives
on imposing pressure on his players, will be analyzed by Simms, the
student who thrived on the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember calling a New England game and I was pretty strong,
questioning something he did,'' Simms said. ``I saw him the next
game and I said, `I guess you heard I got you good.' He said:
`Really? I don't care. You know what you're talking about. If you
questioned it, you must have had a good reason.''' &QL;

 &HT;    Camp start delayed
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The opening of NBA training camps, targeted for Monday, probably
will be pushed back at least one day. Further delays could follow
if league and the players union cannot swiftly complete the
laborious task of fashioning a working agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks' Lenny Wilkens, president of the NBA Coaches
Association, said Thursday that the membership agreed to recommend
a Tuesday start _ at the earliest _ out of respect for the Martin
Luther King Jr. holiday on Monday. The King holiday traditionally
has been a celebration of life in the NBA withmost teams in action.
The league's original schedule had 10 games, six in the afternoon.
In another matter, the coaches decided to reward themselves for
having agreed to stay away from this week's informal practices for
three days. Although at least one of their number broke the
agreement _ Don Nelson of Dallas claims he misunderstood the rule _
the coaches voted to relax the prohibition. Now, they can watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have to stay maybe 40 rows away from the court,''
Wilkens said, laughing from his perch on the top row of Alexander
Memorial Coliseum at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Below, the usual mixed group of veterans, free agents and
rookies worked out, although Steve Smith and Ed Gray were the only
Hawks under contract who were there Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the coaches a chance to see draft picks Roshown McLeod
and Shammond Williams in action. McLeod, the late-blooming forward
from Duke, did not disappoint, showing strength and body control
inside that should allow him to score against bigger opponents. ``A
lot of guys can't do that,'' Wilkens noted as McLeod hung in the
air with the ball behind his head, delayed a beat, then shot the
ball softly into the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Hawks strength and conditioning coach Pete Radulovic said both
rookies are in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say that's true of all our guys,'' Radulovic said. ``You
don't expect the guys to come to camp ready to start the season,
but you want them in good enough shape so they can take advantage
of two-a-days and you don't want them getting hurt, especially when
you have a short season.''
</P>
<P>
   Radulovic said he had seen enough of the Hawks' four contract
players _ Mookie Blaylock, Dikembe Mutombo, Smith and Gray _ to
know they are prepared to start camp. The same is true for Tyrone
Corbin and Alan Henderson, who might elect to remain here this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say that Ty is lighter than I've ever seen him,''
Radulovic said. ``Ed is in much better shape than he was as a
rookie. Mookie and Smitty and the other guys aren't going to let
themselves get out of shape, so we shouldn't have any troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   The band of players working here _ including free agents Ivano
Newbill, Pig Miller and Jon Barry, Orlando rookie Matt Harpring and
Vancouver's Shareef Abdur-Rahim _ lost one of the regulars
Thursday. Brent Barry, who played with the Hawks last season, flew
out to Seattle, which invited him to camp.

 &HT;    Falcons edge
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the half-dozen rushing touchdowns Minnesota Vikings
tailback Robert Smith scored this season were runs of 57, 61 and 74
yards, and he averaged 40.7 yards on the six scores. Even so, the
Minnesota running game is not all dash and no smash.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings' running game lacks the raw power of the Atlanta
attack, which is as subtle as an uppercut to the jaw. But the NFL's
most potent offense, with its 80-yard opening drive in last week's
victory against Arizona, showed a knockout punch of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some teams feel that if they just stop the big play, we'll
struggle or get frustrated,'' center Jeff Christy said. ``But we're
more than a finesse team that throws the ball all over the field.
When we have to muscle up, we do it. We don't run as a diversion
or, like some people think, to give our receivers time to catch
their breath. There is more balance to this offense than we are
given credit for having.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota ran on 44.6 percent of its snaps in the regular
season, just about the NFL average of 44.8 percent. There was
nothing average, though, about the results from offensive
coordinator Brian Billick's well-designed rushing attack.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Smith, who gained 1,187 yards despite missing two games
with a sprained knee ligament, the Vikings ranked No. 11 in
rushing. Their average carry of 4.3 yards was better than the
Falcons' 4.1. Smith had 30 runs of 10-plus yards, most of them to
the right side behind guard David Dixon and tackle Korey Stringer,
who average more than 350 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Backup tailback Leroy Hoard, a nine-year journeyman whose lack
of quickness isn't as apparent on artificial surfaces, provided a
nice change of pace with his power running. Hoard scored nine
rushing touchdowns, eight of them inside the 20 and five inside the
4. At 6 feet 2, 209 pounds, Smith is deceptively tough and has
fumbled once in more than 600 touches.
</P>
<P>
   Billick cited the running game as a primary reason the Vikings
had so few ``three-and-out'' series. Minnesota failed to gain a
first down on just 24 of 181 possessions during the season, at 13.3
percent the lowest rate in the league. The Falcons, by comparison,
had a ``three-and-out'' rate of 19.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While the Falcons use the run to set up their play-action
passing game, Minnesota is a pass-first team that runs several
plays that flow off the same initial action as the passing game.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the presence of 10-time Pro Bowl guard Randall McDaniel,
the Vikings will not trap much. Their staple running plays tend to
feature zone blocking, with Smith taking a long handoff and trying
to find a crease to the outside shoulder of the tackle. In most
situations, the Vikings will use a one-back set, with an occasional
H-back.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Minnesota running game resembles San
Francisco's. That Atlanta's front seven has been able to shut down
virtually every opponent it has faced _ the Falcons ranked No. 2 in
the league against the rush _ could make the running game a
standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Left end Lester Archambeau is an active player who should be
able to take advantage of Stringer's habit of not finishing blocks.
A real key, though, should be the ability of left tackle Travis
Hall to get inside Dixon. The right guard is the most improved
player on the Minnesota line but still is susceptible to an inside
move. If Atlanta can contain Smith and keep him from popping into
the secondary, the Falcons should be able to limit the damage from
the Minnesota rushing attack.

 &HT;    The genuine star defender
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Twenty-seven years ago, James Anderson was no closer
to celebrity life than the Falcons were to an NFC title game. But
when the telephone rang in his Newark, N.J., home one day in 1972,
it not only changed the course of his life, it had a profound
effect on the development of one of his sons, Jamal.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls from Muhammad Ali will do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been assigned to work security for him at a rally,''
Anderson said. ``For a 22-year-old police officer, that was like
taking a Secret Service agent right out of the academy and putting
him with the president. It was scary, because I was just learning
about things like crowd control. But we got along real well. The
next time he was getting ready for a fight, he called me.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson picked up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing, boy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's this?'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Ali.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't play with me. Who's this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Ali, fool. I need you to come to camp and work with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson hung up. Moments later, the phone rang again.
</P>
<P>
   ``What'd you hang up on me for, boy? I'm the greatest of
all-time!''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson realized his mistake and quickly accepted an offer to
join Ali's security team. Word got around. Before long. Anderson
was a guard for hire for Sugar Ray Leonard, Michael Jackson, Diana
Ross and others. Before long, Uncle Muhammad was performing magic
tricks for Jamal Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Today, James Anderson is head of security for Mike Tyson. Jamal
Anderson plays for the Falcons, who Sunday visit Minnesota for a
trip to the Super Bowl. Determined to make it to the game, Anderson
will attend the Tyson-Francois Botha fight Saturday night at the
MGM Grand, then board a red-eye flight that departs Las Vegas at 1
a.m. PST and arrives in Minneapolis at 6 a.m. CST, just more than 5
1/2 hours before kickoff
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Falcons win,'' James said, ``I am going to be drunk
from Sunday to the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   It's appropriate that James Anderson be in the stands. Jamal's
upbringing amid celebrities somewhat negated any chance that he
would be in awe of NFL life when the Falcons drafted him as a
seventh-round pick in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal also says his determination came from his father. ``My dad
was intensely competitive, and he's recognized as one of the top
body guards,'' Anderson said. ``He worked hard to be the best in
his business. All of us grew up with that attitude, `Why be
average?'''
</P>
<P>
   Further, it was James Anderson who taught Jamal how to stiff-arm
opponents at the age of 9. Two weeks later in a Pop Warner game,
Anderson cradled a football in his right arm, ran around left end
and knocked over two would-be tacklers with his outstretched hand.
``My coaches and teammates were just stunned,'' he recalled
recently.
</P>
<P>
   The stiff arm and determination will lead to Anderson becoming
one of the NFL's top-paid running backs after this season,
something not lost on his father. ``I'm hoping when he gets his new
contract I can retire,'' James said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Clients are not a problem, though. Anderson was with Tyson for
the first two years of his career, then, as he puts it, ``I went on
to some other clients, and he had some associations I wasn't too
happy with.''
</P>
<P>
   After his second loss to Evander Holyfield, Tyson left promoter
Don King and rehired Anderson. During the fighter's camp in
Phoenix, Tyson lived in a house with Anderson, trainer Tommy Brooks
and aide Carlos Blackwell. Life, Anderson said, was relatively
tame. The closest thing to an incident came when a man wearing
``(Expletive) the police'' buttons approached Tyson and tried to
get him to wear one of the buttons. Anderson politely asked him to
leave
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 6-1, 280 pounds. I don't have to get rough,'' he said.
``You get more with honey than you do with stink.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the scariest moment in his profession came during
an Ali-Ken Norton fight at Yankee Stadium. ``The police were on
strike, and we had to get Ali to the fight in the Bronx with no
police escort. We had to run alongside Ali's car and beat people
back. They tore our clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said most problems occur when escorting a boxer from
the ring to the locker room. ``You have one little alley to walk
through, and all the fans want to see and touch the fighter,'' he
said. ``Then after the fight, fans are really drunk, and they might
not like the way the decision went.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, a fan thrust a knife into the Ali entourage during
the ring entrance. Fortunately, the knife hit a policeman's
gunbelt. ``I'm not even sure who he was aiming for,'' Anderson
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Toronto, Michael Jackson got out of his limo and walked to a
metal fence to wave at fans. ``Frightening,'' Anderson said. ``They
damn near tore the fence down.''
</P>
<P>
   During an Ali weigh-in in Germany, so many people were on stage
that it collapsed. ``Everybody fell in the hole except Ali. He was
balanced on this one piece of wood, as if some angels had lifted
him there.''
</P>
<P>
   Warmer moments included Leonard singing ``Sugar Sugar'' on a
ship sailing from New York to London; Ali crying during a visit to
Auschwitz; and Ali engaging in one of his favorite pastimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``His thing was going to 42nd Street and 8th Avenue, getting out
of the limo and just standing on the corner,'' Anderson said.
``Once people recognized who he was, it was total chaos. He just
wanted to see how long it would take.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, James Anderson predicts a Falcons' upset.
He'll be seated in the Metrodome, wearing a black Falcons hat and
blue leisure suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two outfits that I've worn to games,'' he said. ``The
blue one is 4-0. The black one has a better record _ it's 5-0. But
it's missing a button.''

PREVENTIVE MEDICINE FOR BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In world terms the illness began with comparatively minor
symptoms. Markets began to fail in Thailand on the 2d of July,
1997. But the financial fever soon spread to Malaysia and raged
through Indonesia, infecting even those bastions of good economic
health Singapore and Hong Kong. People called it an Asian flu, but
when it spread to Russia last August, causing a free fall in the
ruble and a default on Russia's debt, it became clear that a
potential pandemic was at hand and the world had no sure remedy.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank tried to halt
the spread by enforcing discipline, telling countries not to spend
beyond their means. But, as in the case of Indonesia, the medicine
had such harmful side effects that events spun out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Globalization _ the integration of world markets in which
investments and currency can move at lightning speed _ was not the
cause but exacerbated the spread of the crisis, just as modern air
travel can spread medical diseases to foreign countries in a matter
of hours while before there might have been a hope of containment.
</P>
<P>
   The United States for the most part remained isolated from the
spreading disaster, but planners knew that Americans had
comparatively few investments in either Southeast Asia or Russia.
The big danger for the United States was that the rot would spread
to Latin America, which absorbs 20 percent of US exports. The key
to Latin America is Brazil, the world's eighth-largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and the IMF hoped they had found
a simple vaccine. Inoculate the endangered country early enough _
before the onset of the disease _ and the patient's own immune
system could prevent a crisis. Two months ago the IMF engineered a
$41.1 billion package of loans and guarantees for Brazil. In
return, Brazil promised to end its profligate ways by curbing its
runaway debt and curtailing spending it could not afford, and it
pledged to defend its currency.
</P>
<P>
   However, the plan entailed several big risks that Rubin and the
IMF had to take into account. Defending the currency would require
such high interest rates that economic activity would be slowed.
The currency was already overvalued. Brazil is a democracy, and it
would not be easy to persuade legislators to curb benefits that
Brazilians had come to take for granted. And about 40 percent of
Brazilians are so poor that to tamper with their benefits was to
risk social disruption.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil for the most part swallowed its medicine, but its
temperature continued to rise. When one of its powerful
semi-autonomous states refused to pay what it owed to the central
government, citing difficulties paying salaries, social programs,
and even food, investor confidence began to crumble, and Brazil
devalued by 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether Brazil can hold the line at this modest
devaluation of its overvalued currency or whether it will become a
new victim of the epidemic and so badly infect the rest of Latin
America that the United States can no longer stay immune.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that the vaccine needs to be improved.
Attempting to inoculate a country early, before fatal symptoms
appear, is still a good idea. But in emerging markets, the world
has to realize that the more democratic the country, the more
difficult it will be to impose restrictions on irresponsible
behavior especially if it means widespread hardships and
unemployment. The IMF should be strengthened to be able to rush the
needed medicine into endangered countries fast. And a financial
mechanism has to be devised to help a country like Brazil, with a
wide band of poverty, provide a social safety net to tide it over
the side effects of imposing financial responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Globalization is a fact of modern life and isn't going away. But
the case of Brazil once again demonstrates the urgent need to
channel and control the powerful speculative forces globalization
has loosed upon the world.

WHEN DOING NOTHING ACCOMPLISHES PLENTY  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 17)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Every year around this time, the cry is heard on
Capitol Hill: Let's put aside partisan politics and get down to
dealing with the issues of real concern to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   It is an especially forceful cry this year. Democrats are eager
for a debate on any policy issue that will turn attention away from
President Clinton's impeachment trial and all that led to it. And
Republicans are petrified of going into the 2000 elections looking
like a party with no agenda beyond hounding the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, when it comes to education, health care, the
environment, national security and other pressing issues, Congress
and the administration have powerful reasons of both substance and
politics to act, and act they probably will, no matter how the
impeachment proceeding plays out.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to a crucial economic issue _ what to do with
the growing federal budget surplus _ there's a case to be made that
the best thing would be continued congressional gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   By demanding last year that the spare cash be set aside until
Congress and the administration could agree on a plan to shore up
Social Security, Clinton thwarted Republican attempts to use the
surplus to finance a big tax cut. His ``Social Security first''
strategy also beat back demands from Democrats in Congress for more
spending on social programs.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, neither party could resist spending some of the
surplus. In a flurry of last-minute deal-making, the White House
and the two parties in Congress agreed to spend $20 billion out of
this year's surplus for ``emergencies'' like aid to farmers and
overhaul of the government's computers to avoid Year 2000 software
problems.
</P>
<P>
   But the surplus for the year ended last Sept. 30, some $70
billion, was left untouched, and the current fiscal year's surplus
is now likely to be at least $76 billion, even after accounting for
the spending spree. The bottom line is this: Washington appears to
have left nearly $150 billion on the table over two years, reducing
the federal government's borrowing needs and thereby freeing up
more capital for private investment at lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Credit for this bit of serendipitous thrift is due less to
well-thought policy than to the political system's difficulties in
climbing out of a long rut of deficit-mindedness and embracing an
era of surplus. Nonetheless, many economists, including Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, believe that it is just
what the economy needs to improve productivity and promote more
long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
   If, in the aftermath of impeachment, the two parties remain
unable again this year to agree on how to divide up the spoils of
the nation's new-found fiscal health, so much the better, many
economists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a political situation that is so evenly balanced
between Republicans and Democrats that you can't really do anything
unless you can get everyone to agree,'' said L. Douglas Lee, the
chief economist for HSBC Securities in Washington. ``That would be
difficult to do under any circumstances, and right now you have an
extremely partisan atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting decision by default _ to allow the surpluses to
accumulate at the Treasury and begin eating into the $5.5 trillion
national debt _ ``may not be a political choice, but a happy
accident,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Continued deadlock over big tax cuts or spending increases could
also prove to be good policy if the economy continues to hum along
as it has for the last several years. Although most economists
expect a slowdown this year, the buoyancy of the stock market and
other indicators suggest that analysts may have again
underestimated the resiliency of the expansion. In such an
atmosphere, fiscal stimulus in the form of broad-based tax cuts or
spending increases might be unnecessary or even harmful.
</P>
<P>
   ``By accident, we have the right fiscal policy in place by doing
nothing,'' said Stan Collender, a budget analyst for
Fleishman-Hillard, the consulting firm. ``I'm not sure we could set
up this policy if we tried, but since we've got it, we should go
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The wild card this year is Social Security. Both the White House
and the Republican leadership say it is still possible to reach a
bipartisan deal on overhauling the retirement system so it is
financially prepared for the aging of the baby boom generation.
However desirable such a deal might be on its own merits, it would
mean open season on the surplus, with plenty of pent-up demand for
tax cuts and spending increases _ good politics, perhaps, but not
necessarily wise economic policy.

TRAINER HOLDS KEY TO TYSON'S COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The way trainer Tommy Brooks sees it, he and Mike
Tyson are locked in the same orbit. If Tyson spins out of control
in his comeback bout against Francois Botha at the MGM Grand on
Saturday night, then Brooks hurtles into oblivion with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I tell him, `You've got to talk to me,''' Brooks
said. ``We have to be on the same page. Not only is his butt on the
line, but my butt is on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks left a lucrative job as the co-trainer to Evander
Holyfield to train Tyson for his first fight since he bit
Holyfield's ears during a title bout on June 28, 1997. Tyson was
disqualified from that bout, fined $3 million and had his boxing
license revoked. He was reinstated on Oct. 19, and now is trying to
re-establish himself as a threat in the heavyweight division.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, 44, was hired to help Tyson reconnect those wires that
short-circuited that night. It is a delicate job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can make me look like a million dollars or he can make me
look like a bum,'' Brooks said. ``From what I see in the gym, I'm
rolling in the chips now.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who has a $2 million, three-fight deal with Tyson, is
part of the new group that surrounds Tyson. Brooks was brought on
board last November at the suggestion of Shelly Finkel, who is
Tyson's new manager. Finkel once managed Holyfield, who is
responsible for Tyson's two losses. Brooks is also the son-in-law
of Lou Duva, who heads the family that owns Main Events, one of the
largest boxing promotions companies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a part of the Duva family, but the Duva family has
nothing to do with Mike Tyson,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Brooks is his own man, which bodes well for his
relationship with Tyson. The trainers who had success with Tyson
early in his career, Teddy Atlas and Kevin Rooney, were able to
hold Tyson's attention and gain his respect. The trainers that
followed Atlas and Rooney _ Jay Bright, Aaron Snowell and Richie
Giachetti _ weren't so successful. Tyson was older, less
cooperative and more self-destructive.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said he has taken a businesslike approach with the
32-year-old Tyson, not become another of his ``yes men'' nor his
buddy. His goal is to return Tyson to the form of the 20-year-old
who became the youngest heavyweight champion in 1986. In the four
months that he has worked with Tyson, Brooks believes he has
rekindled Tyson's competitive fires. In a sense, Brooks said
working with Tyson is no different than working with Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of these guys are competitive,'' Brooks said. ``They both
want to be numero uno. They understand that you have to give
something to get something.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson hasn't had a victory since a first-round knockout of Bruce
Seldon on Sept. 7, 1996. And his image as the baddest man on the
planet is covered with crud.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Tyson had the two losses to Holyfield; had his
license revoked; went through three lengthy and embarrassing
hearings before the New Jersey and Nevada State Athletic
Commissions while seeking to regain his license; faced Internal
Revenue Service tax liens of $13 million; participated in
WrestleMania; pled no contest to punching two men after a traffic
accident in Maryland; faced the possibility of returning to prison
to serve out the remainder of a rape conviction in Indiana; fired
and sued co-managers Rory Holloway and John Horne and promoter Don
King; and was subjected to psychological tests at the Massachusetts
General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks may be the best trainer to deal with Tyson's psyche and
bruised confidence. ``Tommy is a great trainer,'' said Lou Duva.
``He's a disciple of George Benton and he worked with guys like
Pernell Whitaker and Rocky Lockridge, and he was with Evander from
the very beginning. He's learned a lot. He'll get into Tyson's head
and he'll get the most out of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In talking with Tommy, I think Tommy is satisfied that he'll
have him ready for the fight. The proof will be on Saturday
night.''
</P>
<P>
   PUNCH LINES
</P>
<P>
   Tyson weighed-in at 223 pounds, the heaviest of his pro career,
while Botha weighed 233. Tyson weighed 222 in his first fight
against Holyfield on Nov. 9, 1996. ... Muhammad Ali was on hand for
the weigh-in. Ali and Tyson embraced and chatted on stage following
the weigh-in. Ali lent support to Tyson when he went before the
Nevada State Athletic Commission to regain his license on Oct. 19.
... Brooks confirmed that Tyson injured his left hand while
sparring. ``We thought he had fractured it,'' Brooks said. ``As a
precaution, we took him to the hospital and had it X-rayed. He's
fine.'' &QL;

BOUNDARIES TO STEALING ALL THOSE BRIGHT IDEAS  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 17)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., N.C.)  (af) 
 By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; To say that D. Clark Ogle is miffed is a wild understatement. His
company, Johnston Industries, a $300 million textile manufacturer
based in Columbus, Ga., says that it has been the victim of
corporate espionage and that outside consultants hired by a
competitor posed as a prospective investor and a graduate student
to gain access to trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
   And not just any competitor, but Milliken &AMP; Co., a
16,000-employee giant and a 1989 winner of the Malcolm Baldrige
National Quality Award. ``Obviously, the things Milliken did hurt
us,'' said Ogle, Johnston's chief executive. ``They took away
opportunities our people had found for niches we were exploiting
somewhat on our own. Then, basically overnight, we had a competitor
in there knowing our processes.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston is suing Milliken over the matter. Milliken said in a
statement that it would defend itself ``vigorously'' and that its
longstanding policies forbid its employees or consultants from
illegally obtaining proprietary information from competitors.
</P>
<P>
   What irks Ogle most is that Milliken takes pride in its
corporate mantra to ``steal shamelessly.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Christopher E. Bogan, chief executive of Best
Practices, a management consulting firm in Chapel Hill, N.C.: ``The
concept of `steal shamelessly' is really grounded on the concept of
`don't be afraid to borrow.' It's a dramatic statement that no
individual, no company, no team, no industry can corner all good
ideas. It doesn't for a minute suppose that you should steal
proprietary information or trade secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but Ogle contends that couching the concept in words
like ``steal'' is just plain wrong. ``When you take something that
has negative connotations, just the subliminal message you send to
your culture is different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Peters is not totally surprised by Johnston's allegations.
Peters and Nancy Austin wrote about Milliken in ``A Passion for
Excellence'' (Random House, 1985). ``From my experience, the
ethical standard there is very high,'' Peters said. ``But they are
also a very aggressive company. If you have an action-at-all-costs
mentality, even if your ethical standards are high, sometimes
people are pushed to do stuff they shouldn't have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible to promote the kind of omnivorous aggressiveness
implied by the ``steal shamelessly'' slogan without also promoting
behavior that crosses the line into unethical or even illegal
territory?
</P>
<P>
   The original, benign meaning of ``steal shamelessly'' may be
lost on employees new to the business world. In the 1980s, when the
slogan took hold, most corporate cultures had a strong bias against
anything ``not invented here,'' as the phrase went, and companies
rarely acknowledged borrowing ideas from anyone, least of all
rivals. Now, it is commonplace to grab others' good ideas, and even
to share one's own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that people love to share stuff,'' Peters
said. The bad news is that if even one employee takes the phrase
too literally, the rallying cry can seem like a dirty-tricks
license.
</P>
<P>
   Bogan, a co-author of ``Benchmarking for Best Practices''
(McGraw-Hill, 1994), a book about the practice of measuring and
comparing a company's methods and results with competitors, said,
``It's very easy to misinterpret what benchmarking is and what good
it can provide for organizations, because people will wrongly think
it condones illicit behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Preventing that misinterpretation is the challenge. It calls for
making the keep-it-above-board message as loud and clear as the
gung-ho, go-get-'em message.
</P>
<P>
   Peters gave this advice: ``State your case very clearly: `Yes,
we are aggressive. Yes, we are action-oriented. But if there's
anything that ever shows up gray on your record, ethically
speaking, you're either in serious trouble or you're out of here.'
''
</P>
<P>
   For a manager, it is a useful test to ask yourself whether you'd
have to dismiss someone if actions under consideration were ever
found out. Milliken, in its statement, said it did just that,
dismissing its consultants when ``claims were made about the
propriety of the collection techniques being used.'' But
after-the-fact sanctions can be taken to mean ``Don't get caught.''
</P>
<P>
   The message that some holds are barred needs to reach employees
beforehand, with as much vigor and boosterism as ``steal
shamelessly'' had in its nascence. Perhaps the new slogan should
be: ``Play hard, but play clean.''

HOW NEW YORK CITY'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS FAILED ATHLETICS  (Eds: see also

HIGHSCHOOL-DANIELS)
(ART ADV: A photo is being sent. Non-subscribers can make
individual purchase by calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.)  By KIRK JOHNSON and JACK CURRY  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The breakdown of public school athletics in New York
City over the last quarter century was to a great extent a matter
of impersonal forces and unintended consequences. But in equally
large part, the fate of school sports was determined by individuals
_ people who made a difference or who did not, who tried to defend
athletics or who stood idly by on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Reynolds fought back.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, the principal of West Side High School in Manhattan,
became so angry that the 350 students at his alternative school
could get no money from the city for sports that he formed his own
league and ran it himself. Organizing the city's expanding group of
smaller, specialized high schools beginning in the 1970s, Reynolds
pushed and prodded and insisted that sports for students mattered.
It worked.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the more than four dozen alternative high schools like West
Side get money from the Board of Education that, while paltry
compared to schools around much of the nation or in the New York
metropolitan area, is better than nothing. The schools now
participate in interscholastic sports alongside the oldest and
largest schools in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to yell,'' Reynolds said of the lessons he
learned in his battles over sports. ``But you do have to be
aggressive _ you have to continually lobby for your position, you
have write letters and organize meetings, you have to be sort of a
crusader,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, coaches, teachers and administrators across the city say,
Reynolds was an exception _ a principal who would go to the mat for
sports. Most others would not, or could not. The pattern of
de-emphasis of sports and physical education came from the top
down, as Board of Education administrators cut financing and never
restored it, and partly from the bottom up as parents stopped
caring as much or pushed for other school improvements. Principals
were caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Most took the meager amount of money doled out by the Public
Schools Athletic League _ the Board of Education's administrative
arm for high school sports _ and did what they could. They found
ways to raise more money or they eliminated a sport here or a gym
class there as they balanced their budgets and their needs for
books, materials and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Athletics programs, as they struggled, came more and more to
mirror everything that works and does not work about the New York
City school system: varying resources from neighborhood to
neighborhood, varying levels of commitment and ability from school
to school, and always and everywhere a seemingly constant conflict
over politics and labor and management and who was or should be in
charge. Schools chancellors came and went like waves on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Frank J. Macchiarola tried to rebuild some of the sports program
in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and the current schools chief,
Rudy Crew, has added back money in the late 1990s. But the deeper
structural problems remained.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the city's first concerted effort in years to rethink
and retool how it runs its high school sports programs, it has
decided that the answer is to decentralize authority further,
giving more responsibility to individual schools. What many
principals and teachers had seen as a symptom of the erosion in
commitment and money from the center _ decentralized sports
programs that seemed orphaned and at the mercy of neighborhood
economics _ now has been embraced as a cure.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, parts of which are being put in place now,
principals will be charged with insuring that athletes are
academically eligible and medically fit to compete and that coaches
are certified. Principals will enforce rules and assume legal
liability for mishaps or oversights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now trying to say to the principals, `It's your show,'''
said Thomas Hemans, the director of the PSAL, which has until now
scheduled games, set rules, hired officials and certified the
training of coaches since its creation in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   Some principals and teachers say the city is giving up on the
idea of systemwide improvement, while accepting the diminished
state that sports has assumed. Some say they believe that the
overhaul represents real hope of improvement. Still others say the
timing, coming in the middle of a pitched battle between the city
and the principals' union over tenure, promises to make school
sports more of a political issue than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Even principals who think the sports overhaul is a positive step
say that greater decentralization will make the inequities between
poor and middle-class schools more profound because each school
will be left more on its own than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is moving toward school-centered leadership teams,
everything is moving out, this is just in keeping with that whole
movement,'' said Thelma B. Baxter, the principal of Theodore
Roosevelt High School in the Fordham section of the Bronx; the
district has a 100 percent poverty rate among its students and no
athletic fields at all. ``But I think it's going to make it more
difficult for the schools to be competitive _ truly competitive.''
I can't tell you right now the amount of athletic equipment I need
_ money that is not forthcoming from a central authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Watnick, the girls' track coach at South Shore High School
in Brooklyn, questioned the wisdom of further burdening principals.
The new plan will not work, he said, because principals are already
overwhelmed by the responsibilities they have. ``How much do you
want to put on their heads?'' he asked.

 NEW YORK: he asked.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is indisputable about the city's sports overhaul is that it
comes at the expense of the PSAL.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Board of Education task force last year concluded that the
PSAL, which administers sports programs for 165 high schools and
2,361 boys' and girls' teams, had to a great extent failed. Its
staff of eight full-time employees and its network of coaches and
athletic directors who serve as part-time commissioners for
individual sports had been overwhelmed, the report said, by the
sharp growth in the number of high schools in the 1990's and the
explosion of girls' teams that the city was forced by federal law
to create in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The PSAL's new role is more consultant than administrator. It
will schedule games between schools, arrange for officials and
umpires and offer advice about rules and procedures when asked.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison with the PSAL's original mission and historic role
in the school system, such a diminished role falls just short of
extinction. In the century's early decades, when New York City's
system of high school sports and physical education was being
built, and being seen as a national model, the agency was a central
_ sometimes autocratic _ voice and authority and advocate for the
value and necessity of school sports. In the name of greater local
control, that unifying voice, however much it already had been
eclipsed, has been silenced.
</P>
<P>
   But many principals also fear that downsizing the PSAL, whatever
the result for students, will make sports more political in New
York by injecting the issue directly into one of the most divisive
subjects in public education: tenure for principals. The Board of
Education and Giuliani are leading vehement campaigns to chip away
at or eliminate tenure for principals.
</P>
<P>
   Greater local control has raised the specter, some principals
say, of a kind of Trojan horse _ a huge extra task, cast as an
improvement, that principals cannot possibly keep up with, given
all their other duties. The new rule book could come back to haunt
them, they say, as a prosecutorial exhibit with the first major
scandal of poor enforcement or student injury.
</P>
<P>
   The principals' union, for its part, sees little change in the
status quo. Sports will be made better, union officials say,
because principals are more capable and competent than PSAL
staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Crew, the city's schools chancellor, said he believed that
spending increases for sports in the last few years _ and his own
statements of commitment _ had changed the debate: The question is
no longer survival, he said, but rather how to create the proper
role for sports going forward. Crew said in an interview that
athletics must become part of a broader educational effort aimed at
putting students onto what he calls a ``road of personal
competency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would argue that there are many ways of being able to scale
to that road,'' he said. ``And I have not chosen one over the other
_ I'm saying all three have to be present.''
</P>
<P>
   Many principals say they are optimistic about the changes at the
PSAL mainly because they say the administration of sports could not
get much worse.
</P>
<P>
   At Liberty High School, for example, which has only three sports
teams _ boys' and girls' volleyball and coed bowling _ Schnur, the
principal, said that his new responsibilities had resulted in
changes already. Students who want to use the gym after school must
now provide proof that they have had a physical examination. That
rule, he said, has probably been on the books for years, if not
decades, but in the hands of the PSAL, it was never enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was essential that it be changed,'' said Eileen Taylor, the
principal at Aviation High School in Queens and an enthusiastic
supporter of the overhaul. ``More accountability is built in, and
it's more realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Most school officials, though, said that keeping sports going in
New York _ no matter what changes are made in the name of reform _
had become a matter of faith. Either you believe that it can be
done, they said, or you don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grit our teeth and find a way,'' said Wanda Nix, the
athletic director at Townsend Harris High School in Queens. ``I
think there are answers. I think they're out there somewhere.''

AN UNDERACHIEVER, GOLDBERG MOSER O'NEILL , GOES FOR THE BUZZ 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Wash.)   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leading San Francisco agency, Goldberg Moser O'Neill, is
reorganizing to gain a higher profile among advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg Moser, partly owned by the Interpublic Group of
Companies, was founded in 1990 as a spinoff of the San Francisco
office of Chiat/Day, now the TBWA/Chiat/Day unit of Omnicom Group.
Billings have grown from an estimated $58 million then to an
estimated $450 million now from clients like Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton,
Cisco Systems Corp., Coca-Cola Co., Dell Computer Corp., Dreyer's
Grand Ice Cream and the Kia Motors America unit of Hyundai Group.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Goldberg Moser has landed two plum accounts: Lucas
Arts Entertainment Co. in San Rafael, Calif., a software developer
and publisher owned by the film director George Lucas, with
billings estimated at $15 million to $20 million, and Soma Corp. in
Seattle, the operator of an Internet pharmacy site on the World
Wide Web, www.soma.com, with billings estimated at $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a perception that Goldberg Moser has been an
underachiever in the intensely competitive San Francisco and West
Coast advertising markets. Several agencies generally acknowledged
as among America's leading creative shops are neighbors, including
Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners, owned by Omnicom, and Publicis &AMP;
Hal Riney, part of Publicis SA.
</P>
<P>
   Goodby, Silverstein was recently chosen by Dreyer's to handle a
so-called superpremium ice cream brand, though Goldberg Moser
continues handling the Dreyer's and Edy's brands.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg Moser also faces challenges from big agencies that have
or will have full-service offices in San Francisco: the BBDO
Worldwide and DDB Needham Worldwide units of Omnicom and Lowe &AMP;
Partners/SMS, part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic. There are
feisty smaller shops, too, like Butler, Shine &AMP; Stern in nearby
Sausalito, Calif., and the San Francisco office of the British
agency Leagas Delaney.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done better creatively in the last three or four years
and we're extremely profitable,'' said Fred Goldberg, chairman and
chief executive at Goldberg Moser. ``Yet we're not getting the
recognition we think we deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason? ``The work we're doing is not at the level we want
it to be across the board,'' said Goldberg, 57. ``So we've decided
to shake the whole thing up.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of that shake-up is a reorganization involving the
account planning department. Account planners are responsible for
gathering insights from consumers on their opinions about brands
and products, then sharing that information with the creative
department to help produce more effective campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg Moser is renaming account planning as brand planning,
with the brand planning directors paired with creative directors to
form brand-planning teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big opportunity here to figure out how to marry them
together in more meaningful ways,'' said Mike Moser, 45, executive
vice president and account planning director, who becomes executive
vice president in charge of brand management. He will work with
Catrina McAuliffe, senior vice president and chief marketing
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to focus planning back on being much more of a
creative tool instead of an account management tool,'' said Ms.
McAuliffe, 42.
</P>
<P>
   The analytical aspects of the planning directors' jobs are being
shifted to an accountability group. Katheryn Silverthorn, 54,
becomes associate director for accountability; she had most
recently worked at G2 in Huntington Beach, Calif., a unit of Grey
Advertising that closed.
</P>
<P>
   Other executives named to new posts include Nancy Hill, 40, vice
president and business development director, who has worked at
agencies including the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of
TBWA/Chiat/Day, and Brian O'Neill, 46, who has been promoted to
president and chief creative officer from executive vice president
and creative director.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a bit of a pull between wanting to be a creative
agency,'' O'Neill said, ``and wanting to be a responsible agency
making sure the work works.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to create a buzz for the agency so that we'll be
mentioned in the same breath as a Goodby, a Chiat/Day, a Fallon
McElligott, a Wieden &AMP; Kennedy,'' he added, ``which helps to
energize how your clients feel about the work you're doing for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to hire people when you have that buzz,'' O'Neill
said, adding that Goldberg Moser plans to expand the creative
department. A third associate creative director has joined the
agency: Rob Bagot, 35, a former senior copywriter at Goodby,
Silverstein who most recently had been chairman and creative
director at the Seattle office of a creative boutique, Big
Bang &UR;  &LR; Idea Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   One long-term goal for the reorganization, Goldberg said, is to
more than double billings, to $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's unrealistic that we could reach that in
three years,'' he said, adding, ``But if we don't, that would be
OK, as long as we achieve getting our recognition up at a much
higher level than it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   To be continued in January 2002.

 Franklin Firing 560 Employees  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Franklin Resources said yesterday that it is firing 560 employees,
or about 7 percent of its workforce, in the first layoffs ever made
by the giant mutual fund company.
</P>
<P>
   The firm is slashing about 450 jobs at its San Mateo
headquarters, and another 190 nationwide, said spokeswoman Holly
Gibson. Pink slips went out to employees yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts stem partly from Franklin's decision to shift
transaction processing and other back-office operations from
headquarters to its processing center at Rancho Cordova near
Sacramento. Some jobs also will disappear at the Rancho Cordova
site and at other U.S. facilities.
</P>
<P>
   No investment management jobs are being eliminated, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it will take a $58 million charge from
earnings, with most of it coming in its first fiscal quarter ended
December 31, to pay severance and other costs. Not counting the
charge, Franklin estimated that it earned between 39 cents and 42
cents a share for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company had warned in late December that it expected to post
disappointing earnings in the quarter because of
higher-than-expected costs and a fall in assets in its stock mutual
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the job cuts weren't triggered by poor performance, said
Chief Financial Officer Marty Flanagan. Instead, he said, the
cutbacks were the result of combining three separate operations
into one.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin in recent years bought the Templeton and Mutual Series
mutual fund groups and in the process picked up their back-office
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what happened in the marketplace, we would have
had this happen to us,'' Flanagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin has suffered recently because its investment style has
been out of favor.
</P>
<P>
   The company is known for mutual funds that focus on foreign
stocks and fundamentally strong companies whose stocks have been
beaten down in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Its best-known fund manager, managing director Mark Mobius, is
regarded as one of the world's leading experts in the stock markets
of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   But international stock markets, especially those in Asia, have
badly lagged the United States. And Franklin's focus on so-called
value stocks has caused it to miss many of the big gains in such
industries as computer networking and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Templeton is a value player, and value is out of style,'' said
Richard Del Monte, a Danville money manager.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Franklin funds have done poorly recently. Its
Growth Fund fell 0.33 percent in the first 11 months of 1998, for
example, compared with a 19.9 percent rise in the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 Index.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Franklin's stock fund assets dropped 4.2 percent to
$130.2 billion, driven mainly by a sharp decline in its
international funds.

TESTAVERDE TAKES ON HIS DOUBTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Don't tell Vinny. Vinny will tell you.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to statistics, Vinny Testaverde knows them all. Of
course, he has heard them for most of his 12-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never beaten Denver either,'' Testaverde said Thursday
with a mischievous grin. Just as he had never been the winning
quarterback against Miami or Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   But this season _ Testaverde calls it magical _ he directed the
Jets to two victories over the Dolphins, and he completed 24 of 36
passes against the Jaguars last Sunday in a 34-24 playoff victory _
the Jets' first in 12 years. That vaulted them into Sunday's
American Football Conference championship game against Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde has faced the Broncos twice in his career _ in 1994
with the Cleveland Browns and in 1996 after the franchise moved to
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, someone asked Testaverde if he knew the
significance of the pair of touchdowns he had tossed in a Jets
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you mean the minus-two thing?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The minus-two thing was the difference between Testaverde's
career touchdowns and interceptions at that point of the season.
That was the statistic that Testaverde has spent more than six
years trying to overcome. It was a legacy _ perhaps relic is more
precise now _ from his troubled early years with the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Testaverde is far beyond that, statistically and
emotionally. It doesn't seem to matter to him that Broncos safety
Tyrone Braxton wondered this week whether Testaverde could be
rattled. Even Testaverde's former boss at Cleveland and Baltimore,
Art Modell, suggested late in the season that judgment should be
withheld on Testaverde's comeback. But before the Jets' victory
over Jacksonville, Modell conceded that, yes, Testaverde is indeed
a finer player.
</P>
<P>
   There are still some people who believe his 29 touchdowns to 7
interceptions were a fluke, that his 13-1 record as the Jets'
starter has somehow been constructed by 10 other players on offense
and that he has been along for the ride. Just wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm past it,'' Testaverde said. ``Nothing in the past affects
what I do in the future. It's like night and day. It's not like a
mental block for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Testaverde seems to revel in this questioning of his
heart, and mind. Somewhere, though, someone will always question
whether he will revert to Tampa Bay Vinny.
</P>
<P>
   He heard still another question Thursday during his daily news
conference about being rattled. Unlike many other quarterbacks,
Testaverde makes himself available to the news media several days a
week. Unfailingly, he has answered questions with the same
even-tempered style he has displayed on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about that stuff,'' he said as the word
``rattled'' evoked something between a sneer and a grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I think about that, it will be a distraction. Right now,
I've got to be focused more than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as significant as the array of offensive weapons he has
used so well this season, Testaverde believes that coach Bill
Parcells has helped create the atmosphere for him to do well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll have the team prepared, and that's a big burden off my
shoulders because I don't have to try to do it myself,'' Testaverde
said.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde is usually deadpan. But a wide grin broke out as he
thought about Joe Namath, whose picture used to adorn his bedroom
wall back in nearby Elmont, N.Y., where Testaverde was the best
player on the Pop Warner team.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke to Namath a few weeks ago, and the Hall of Fame
quarterback pumped him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wished me well and said he hoped that I get what I wanted,
and that's a championship,'' Testaverde said.
</P>
<P>
   As for being a sizable underdog Sunday, Testaverde knows that
Namath won the most famous Super Bowl of all, 30 years ago, as an
18-point underdog to the Baltimore Colts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of guys like Joe and what happened in '69,''
Testaverde said, ``it makes it possible for teams like us to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Testaverde seems unemotional about what is coming up,
he has a very good memory about what another quarterback did to the
team considered the best outfit in pro football once upon a time.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is another reason Testaverde calls 1998 his magical
season.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS:
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Glenn (ankle) is listed as questionable for the Jets.
...Denver, in a take-that attitude toward the league, has listed 18
players as probable. Earlier this season, the Broncos were fined
when they didn't list John Elway as having received treatment for a
hamstring injury. He missed a game and the club was fined $10,000.
Since then the Broncos have listed as many as 25 players on the
injury report. Every player who visited the trainer, even for a
Band-Aid, made the list. The designation probable means the team
believes there is a 75 percent chance the player will perform. ...
Keyshawn Johnson, who produced a pair of touchdowns, an
interception and a fumble recovery against the Jaguars, has been
named the conference's offensive player of the week. John Hall,
with his 52-yard field goal and then clinching 30-yard field goal
in the last minute, was named the special teams player of the week.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. _ At least since the days of disco, the
keen-minded undergraduates of Princeton University have considered
it a right _ a solemn duty even _ for members of the sophomore
class to gather at midnight following the winter's first
substantial snowfall and run naked through Holder Courtyard, a wide
quadrangle surrounded by Gothic dormitory buildings. They call it
the ``nude olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the students who participate in this
quarter-century-old tradition are often emboldened by alcohol. But
the drinking and frigid frolicking can be a bad mix.
</P>
<P>
   After this year's nude olympics on Friday night, five students
were hospitalized with alcohol poisoning and four more were treated
at the school's health center, prompting the university's
president, Harold Shapiro, to suggest that the tradition should
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I recognize that versions of this event have been a
regular occurrence in recent years, I believe we can no longer
tolerate the risks that it has come to pose to our students,''
Shapiro wrote in a terse letter to the editor that was published on
Wednesday in The Daily Princetonian, the student newspaper. ``I am
simply not willing to wait until a student dies before taking
preventive action.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a committee headed by the dean of student life, Janina
Montero, would be formed to consider the event's future.
</P>
<P>
   While Shapiro's letter to The Princetonian stopped short of
calling for an outright ban of future nude olympics, he and other
administrators, including Ms. Montero, and several of the masters
of the school's residential halls have made it clear that putting
an end to the annual streak through the snow is pretty much what
they have in mind. In addition to the drinking, school officials
have cited concerns about sexual activity that took place in Holder
Courtyard on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   But any suggestion of banning the nude olympics is almost
certain to anger a large number of undergraduates who regard the
event as a rite of a passage and an integral aspect of the
Princeton experience. ``Why else come to Princeton over Harvard and
Yale?'' Lance Nedham, a junior, asked in The Daily Princetonian
earlier this week. Even with final exams under way this week, the
shadow Shapiro cast over the future of the nude olympics has
dominated campus conversation.
</P>
<P>
   On the snow-covered campus Thursday night, most students were
hunkered down in the library or their dorm rooms to study. Brian
Stewart, a junior who was walking home to Dodd Hall to study for an
exam on European intellectual history, said the nude olympics
offered Princeton students one night to let loose. ``The nude
olympics is something where everybody gets together and does
something that is probably crazier than any other school has,'' he
said. ``So while we're not crazy at all at any other time during
the year, we make up for it in one night.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was among the spectators who watched the 350 or so
students _ most clad in little more than boots and scarves _
participate Friday night, and said he had called for medical
attention for one participant who was drunk and injured. ``He was
lying on the stairs, completely naked, just completely knocked out.
He was taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that all the students who received treatment on
Friday night were expected to make a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Word that future nude olympics were in jeopardy quickly spread
from the Princeton campus to alumni who immediately began to
discuss the situation by e-mail. ``Will the sociopaths be removed
from the community or will the event be removed from the
community?'' wrote Terry Wintroub, a member of the class of 1969.
Peter Dutton, a member of the class of 1991, asked: ``Can't
undergraduates run naked in a restrained and dignified manner
anymore?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The debate comes at a time when drinking at Princeton is under
scrutiny by a subcommittee of the university's trustees. The
committee is expected to announce its initial findings at a meeting
of trustees later this month and to recommend possible changes to
the university's alcohol regulations this spring. ``The problem
here at Princeton is the same as it is everywhere else and it is as
serious as it is everywhere else,'' said Justin Harmon, a
university spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Even defenders of the nude olympics concede that this year's
event got a little out of control and they have offered several
reasons for the exceptionally raucous run. To start, there was no
nude olympics last year because of a lack of snow, meaning that
this year's sophomores did not get to observe the event as freshmen
and were perhaps excessively boisterous. Also this year's event
fell on the last Friday before exams, meaning no classes the next
day and more steam to blow off.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is not the first nude olympics to get out of hand.
In 1992, 31 Princeton students pleaded guilty to violating a
municipal ordinance by extending their naked run off campus, onto
public streets and even into some businesses. They were fined $100
and sentenced to community service.
</P>
<P>
   While administrators have almost always expressed a certain
disdain for the event, Shapiro's statement this week was the first
suggestion that the university might seek to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Caputo, a sophomore from Montgomery, N.J., who ran naked
on Friday night, said he enjoyed being part of an institutional
tradition. ``It seemed like everyone was having a good time,'' he
said. ``I circled the place at least 10 times, it was fantastic. It
was really a liberating experience.''

TYSON A PAY-PER-VIEW DARLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The more raging bull that comes out of Mike
Tyson's mouth, the more Jay Larkin has reason to believe Saturday
will be another eventful night in the history of pay-per-view
boxing.
</P>
<P>
   The MGM Grand in Las Vegas may not sell out. But TV viewers with
$45.95 will have the privilege of witnessing another... what shall
we call it?
</P>
<P>
   ``People will watch him fight in the same way they watch car
races, to see the wrecks,'' said Larkin, the senior VP of Showtime
sports and executive producer of Saturday's fight that pits Tyson
against Francois Botha. The card starts at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson offered up a few more memorable-yet-predictable interviews
Wednesday. During a teleconference call with TV sportscasters,
Tyson refused to stop cursing when asked by Russ Salzberg of New
York's WWOR.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson also recently ran ESPN reporter Mark Schwartz out of his
gym in Phoenix after hearing an ESPN2 roundtable discussion that
was critical of him.
</P>
<P>
   Keep it up, Mike. There's no such thing as bad publicity for TV.
Not with 700 credentialed reporters running around to help spread
the word.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty confident it will do well,'' Larkin said. ``Just
look at his stats. He's a participant in seven of the top
performing pay-per-view events of all time. Last year, his absence
from the scene caused this deep valley in the business. When Mike
came back from prison and fought Peter McNeeley (in 1995), it set
an all-time record (for a non-championship fight) that stands to
this day (surpassed only by the two Tyson title bouts against
Evander Holyfield).
</P>
<P>
   ``(Tyson) might as well have fought a goat (instead of
McNeeley).''
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Time-Warner in Chatsworth has it priced up to $49.95 on
the day of the fight, when it gets about 65 percent of its buys.
</P>
<P>
   The Jordan factor: NBC was prepared for the day Michael Jordan
would not be there to inflate the ratings on its NBA telecasts. The
network just hoped it could delay the inevitable another season.
</P>
<P>
   As the NBA schedule-makers piece together a 50-game regular
season, NBC now plans to have the Chicago Bulls on no more than a
half-dozen times, and most likely as regional telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Lakers, whose odds for a title just got better,
could be America's new team. There will be a definite local boost
for Fox Sports West and KCAL Channel 9, who split the schedule and
have seen a noticeable drop in ratings without the Lakers games.
</P>
<P>
   As it showed during baseball's comeback, TV plays a major role
in winning back fans. People may say they aren't going to any NBA
games this season as a protest of the lockout, but it doesn't mean
they won't sneak a peek at the TV to see how Kobe Bryant, Shaquille
O'Neal and pals are doing.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement this week, NBC Sports chief Dick Ebersol said:
``It will be exciting to see what players and what `super teams'
step into the spotlight for fans to embrace. We have to reintroduce
the new generation of stars in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week after the lockout settlement was announced, Ebersol
was asked about the Jordan factor in regards to what NBC showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (absence of Jordan) was an issue when scheduling came up
last May,'' Ebersol said. ``We had 11 appearances for the Bulls
backed up with at least seven or eight regional telecasts (before
the season was cut short).
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the day was going to come some day. Remember, we had
two seasons without him and in those days, we didn't protect them
with backup games.''
</P>
<P>
   NBA regular-season games that drew high-6 ratings last year with
Jordan should be more in the low 3s this year anyway because of the
lockout. In the playoffs, games with Jordan were in the 16-to-20
range. Without him, ratings for championship games _ such as
Houston's back-to-back runs while Jordan played baseball _ were in
the 12-to-14 range.
</P>
<P>
   We got your coverage right here: It's somewhat understandable
that all three ESPN channels, all Fox cable stations, MSNBC and CNN
went live with Jordan's retirement announcement Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But on another tier of ``why bother'' channels, KCBS-Channel 2
broke into ``Martha Stewart Living,'' KNBC-Channel 4 and Tom Brokaw
interrupted ``Leeza,'' KTTV-Channel 11 hit the dump button on ``I
Love Lucy,'' and KTLA-Channel 5 had enough of ``Sally Jessy
Raphael'' and picked up Chicago's WGN coverage, which might have
been the most thorough of all, as it was during the Sammy Sosa-Mark
McGwire home run circus last summer.
</P>
<P>
   In L.A., only ABC's local affiliate, KABC-Channel 7, had the
presence of mind to stay with ``Regis and Kathie Lee,'' which, on
Wednesday, was actually George Hamilton co-hosting with Kathie Lee
Gifford. So maybe that made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Grossest coverage? Try the Home Shopping Network, which was just
doing its job within seconds of the announcement. A ``blockbuster
Sports-Central special'' sale of the new 23-card Upper Deck Michael
Jordan Retirement Box Set ($19.85, down from $25) went to impulse
buyers across the country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
_Shaquille O'Neal's public-relations-minded quip on ESPN's
``SportsCenter'' Tuesday: ``Now I can tell all my 10 children from
nine different women that I played against the great Michael
Jordan.'' Shaq Daddy was just jokin', OK? &QL; 
_John Madden finds something refreshing, and it isn't from the
exhaust fumes coming out of his bus. After years of doing NFC
championship games involving San Francisco, Green Bay and Dallas,
Sunday's Atlanta-Minnesota game (Channel 11, 9:30 a.m.) actually
has Fox's crusty old analyst energized. ``All these fresh things
are happening, a whole bunch of things... that's exciting in
itself. The thing is, you have to earn the right to play in this
game and these are the teams that won, so that makes them the new
marquee teams.'' For what it's worth, Madden's birth town of
Austin, Minn., gave him a hero's welcome Thursday. Gifts included
three pounds of pork chops from the Hormel meat-packing plant in
Austin. &QL; 
_Sunday-night golf. It can only happen with a tournament in Hawaii,
and ESPN has arranged that with rare final-round coverage of the
PGA Tour's Hawaiian Open, which runs from 5 to 8 p.m. Sunday (as
well as 4:30 to 7 p.m. today and 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. Saturday). &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
_Ahmad Rashad's tribute to MJ on ``NBA Inside Stuff'' (Channel 4,
Saturday at 10:30 a.m.) &QL; 
_More MJ-a-go-go _ ESPN Classic runs 56 straight hours of Jordan
games, interviews, etc., starting at 4 p.m. today. And People
magazine, for only the second time in its history, thought enough
to do a split cover of its Jan. 25 issue. Most of the country will
get a Prince Edward-gets-married cover, but 12 Midwest states will
have Jordan on the front. Whatever sells, baby. &QL; 
_HBO's ``Real Sports'' and reporter Armen Keteyian have been
putting together a sizzling piece on the Fox-Disney battle for TV
sports domination, which should air next month. It sounds
intriguing, but then consider _ HBO's parent company, Time-Warner,
is directly connected to Ted Turner. Could this be some cruel joke,
pitting two opponents against each other for the betterment of one
crafty Southerner?

MADZA PROTEGE: A SEDAN THAT SIPS GAS IN AN AGE OF BIG GULPS

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 17) 
(af) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The radio headline grabbed my attention: ``Gas prices
drop to the lowest level in history.'' While analysts on the
newscast pondered whether gas could become even cheaper, I had to
wonder if small cars, like the 1999 Mazda Protege I was driving at
the moment, were on their way to becoming irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Small-car sales have plunged along with gasoline prices, falling
nearly 20 percent in the last two years. Car buyers are instead
opting for large, powerful and comparatively thirsty sport
utilities, pickup trucks and luxury sedans.
</P>
<P>
   Even people in their 20s, who have made up the vast majority of
small-car buyers, are instead choosing small sport utilities and
other vehicles perceived as being cooler than compact sedans.
</P>
<P>
   Like some other sales trends born of gasoline cheaper than
bottled water _ gas is well below 90 cents a gallon in many parts
of the country _ this one is unfortunate. Small cars have never
been better, with generally good quality control, spirited
performance, responsive handling and amenities once reserved for
large, luxury automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Among the newest of these big-little cars is the Protege _ Mazda
accents the second ``e,'' but not the first _ which stacks up well
against the competition in styling, ride, handling and price. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although I usually try to avoid holiday crowds, my work and
travel schedules required me to do my holiday shopping on one of
the busiest days of the year. The nimble Protege turned out to be
the perfect car for my mission.
</P>
<P>
   With its classy, sophisticated styling, the Protege needed to
make no apologies for its appearance in a parking lot filled with
BMWs and Mercedes-Benzes at a toney suburban mall.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's marketing line _ that the car breaks ``out of
the box'' _ may be an exaggeration. And although the company
enlisted a group of celebrity individualists to help promote the
Protege, I cannot quite envision Dennis Rodman, or even Marisa
Tomei, signing a purchase agreement at the local Mazda dealer. As
good as the Protege is in many respects, it can't match the New
Beetle or the Mercury Cougar in the personality department.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is a tad smaller than its predecessor, the new Protege
feels very roomy, with ample room, front and back, for heads and
knees. The nearly 6-footers who sat behind the wheel reported no
problem getting comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Protege is technically a five-passenger sedan, I
wouldn't want to join two other adults in the back seat for very
long. The rear does easily accommodate three children, and all can
be strapped into three-point safety belts.
</P>
<P>
   Other safety equipment includes dual front air bags; in contrast
to the Toyota Corolla, Chevrolet Prizm or Mitsubishi Galant, the
Protege does not offer side air bags. Anti-lock brakes are optional
on the mid-level LX and top-end ES, but are not available on the
base model, the DX.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the Protege has the generic feel and layout of most
small Japanese cars. Controls are simple, logical and easy to read
and use. But Mazda has used high-quality materials throughout the
interior, and that gives the Protege an extra measure of class.
</P>
<P>
   The new Protege's underpinnings are borrowed from the Capella, a
narrow version of the 626 sedan sold outside the United States. The
most striking thing about the car is its very solid body structure
_ and ``solid'' was the word I found myself using whenever I
described the Protege to others.
</P>
<P>
   That strong body should result in long-term durability, but it
also provides immediate benefits: the handling is responsive and
the ride is smooth and quiet. Both ride and handling, in fact, are
above average for compact cars. Furthermore, the car's solid
structure should help to protect occupants in a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Available only as a front-drive sedan, the Protege comes with
two engines. The DX and LX have a 1.6-liter, twin-cam, in-line
four-cylinder that produces 105 horsepower. The ES has a 1.8-liter,
twin-cam four with 122 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   Either engine can be paired with a five-speed manual
transmission or a four-speed automatic. And though it may not
matter to many people, the fuel economy for both engines is
outstanding, with combined city-highway ratings around 30 miles per
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Neither engine stands out in the class for power, however. The
1.6 liter has fewer horsepower than the base engines of the Honda
Civic, Nissan Sentra or Toyota Corolla. The larger engine is
preferable, even if it, too, comes up short against the competition
and even though it adds $2,000 to the sticker price, since it comes
only on the ES.
</P>
<P>
   With the big engine and other features, the ES test car topped
out at less than $16,000, which seems reasonable if you consider
the likelihood that you can strike a better deal. (Sticker prices
of small cars may seem high, at least to those who haven't gone
car-shopping for a while, but the soft market has forced
manufacturers and dealers to offer sweeteners, from rebates to
cut-rate financing to special lease deals.)
</P>
<P>
   The DX starts at $12,420 and includes power steering, power
brakes (front disks, rear drums), rear-seat heater ducts, a split
fold-down back seat, tilt steering wheel and adjustable shoulder
belts.
</P>
<P>
   The LX opens at $13,580 and adds cruise control,
steering-wheel-mounted switches, an audio system with a CD player,
power locks, windows and mirrors, integrated rear-seat head rests
and adjustable driver's seat. The ES also has air-conditioning,
keyless locking and upgraded wheels.
</P>
<P>
   The Honda Civic, one of the few small cars to show year-to-year
sales gains, offers far more choice than the Protege _ three body
styles and a variety of powertrains at a slightly higher price. In
my opinion, it still leads the class in engineering excellence and
technology. But the Protege stacks up well, particularly for buyers
who don't care much about horsepower and don't mind having fewer
choices.
</P>
<P>
   At the mall, with almost every item checked off my to-do list, I
headed home. I packed the extremely roomy 12.9-cubic-foot trunk
with packages and noted that if I had folded the split rear seat, I
could have accommodated the cross country skis I'd considered
buying.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the cabin was packed to the sills. I'd made more than
a dozen stops _ not one of them at a gas station. For that I was
thankful, even if gas prices are the lowest in history. &QL;

more load funds is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 17) 
(af) 
 By ABBY SCHULTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why would an investor spend a lot of time researching which fund
to buy, go to a discount broker to buy it and then end up paying a
sales charge?
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a bad deal, yet discount brokers are increasingly
offering funds with sales charges, or loads, along with no-load
funds in their fund supermarkets. In fact, many fund supermarkets
now offer far more load funds than no-loads _ a distinction not
trumpeted in ads that tend to emphasize the breadth of the
offerings instead.
</P>
<P>
   And people are buying the higher cost funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are kind of tossing money away,'' said Don Phillips,
president of Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago.
``The load is designed to pay for financial planning expertise _
you are paying yourself, even though the revenues don't flow
through to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does the load go? The mutual fund prospectus spells out
what portion _ usually 80 percent to 90 percent _ goes to the
broker, or whatever third party sold the fund. A traditional
brokerage firm will split the load with whoever actually gave the
advice _ its broker, or a financial adviser.
</P>
<P>
   A discount brokerage firm, however, pockets the entire
commission _ without providing the advice that the load is intended
to pay for.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is a big payoff for the discount firms, but
they say they are just giving customers what they want. It is the
same reason that grocery stores carry anchovy paste, even though
few customers buy it regularly, said Matt Sadler, senior vice
president at Fidelity Funds Network, the fund supermarket operated
by Fidelity Investments. If someone asks for the product, Sadler
said, Fidelity wants to be able to say, ``Sure, how much do you
want?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said that ``far less'' than 5 percent of Fidelity's
retail brokerage customers buy load funds. (While the company's
supermarket sells load-bearing Fidelity funds that are marketed
directly to individual investors, it does not offer Fidelity's more
expensive Advisor funds, which are sold only through brokers.)
</P>
<P>
   Some load funds have great returns, the discount brokers say,
and investors want them despite the cost. At Quick &AMP; Reilly, for
example, the John Hancock Financial Industries fund was a big
seller in 1997, when it returned nearly 38 percent, despite an
initial sales charge of 5 percent, said Peter Quick, the president.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Bobroff, a funds consultant in East Greenwich, R.I., said
investors ``may be making a conscious decision to pay that load.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for offering load funds is that customers want
all their investments in one place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually have, as do other supermarkets, a number of new
investors coming to us after having some experience at another
brokerage firm,'' Sadler said. Those customers would need to
maintain multiple accounts if Fidelity did not make load funds
available _ ``not a very customer friendly thing to do,'' he
observed.
</P>
<P>
   At Discover Brokerage Direct, which is just beginning to develop
its fund business, Tom O'Connell, executive vice president, said
the focus would be on funds with no transaction fees or loads.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what people look for in a direct business, and we're in
a direct business,'' he said. But load funds will be available so
that customers can buy new shares of funds they already own.
Discount brokers cannot waive the loads, he added, because fee
arrangements are spelled out in the fund prospectus, which brokers
cannot alter.
</P>
<P>
   That argument does not placate critics. The funds themselves
could change the situation, said Susan Belden, editor of No-Load
Fund Analyst, a newsletter based in Orinda, Calif. It is ``tough to
come up with a rationale,'' she said, for charging a load to
customers who are doing all the work on their own. Ms. Belden
argued that fund families could create a share of no-load classes
for clients of discount brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Most discount brokers say load funds make up far less than 5
percent of all their mutual fund retail sales. Waterhouse
Securities is an exception; as many as 12 percent of its 1.5
million retail customers buy load funds, according to Melissa
Gitter, a spokeswoman. John Chapel, president of Waterhouse, said,
``Our thinking is that there is value in load funds and
no-transaction-fee funds, and we let our customers choose based on
what's best for them.''
</P>
<P>
   E(star)Trade, the on-line brokerage concern, gives investors
access to Morningstar data so that they can compare load and
no-load funds before buying, said Brian C. Murray, general manager
for the mutual funds group. Still, he said, ``it's hard for me to
believe anyone can look at the funds side by side and choose the
load fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Load fund companies say their main reason for making funds
available through the supermarkets is to serve registered
investment advisers, not to sell directly to investors. Advisers,
buying in volume for their clients, are essentially treated as
institutional investors, purchasing shares without paying a load.
Most are compensated by the fees they charge their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Cemo, head of retail marketing at AIM Management
Group, said his company chose to be part of Charles Schwab
Institutional Onesource in order to reach financial advisers. And
because AIM's load funds were available through this network, Cemo
said, the company figured they might as well also be available to
Schwab's retail customers. Fewer than 1 percent of AIM's customers
buy load funds directly through supermarkets, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab decided early on that self-directed, price-sensitive
discount brokerage customers would not pay a load to buy a mutual
fund. So Schwab arranged for mutual fund companies to pay fees to
it for distributing their funds, said Phillips at Morningstar. The
fees, to the consternation of some fund companies, come out of the
fund's expense ratios, so investors essentially pay nothing for the
convenience of buying funds through a network.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Schwab offers fewer funds to its retail clients than
other major supermarkets _ about 1,640 funds, including only 144
with loads, and less than half with transaction fees.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey M. Lyons, head of mutual funds marketing at Schwab, says
the firm simply offers the funds its clients want to buy. ``We
haven't willy-nilly added load funds to say that we have a lot of
funds,'' he said. Less than 0.3 percent of Schwab's 5.4 million
active retail customers buy load funds.

HOUSE PROSECUTORS OPEN CASE AGAINST CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House prosecutors presented opening arguments
Thursday in the first presidential impeachment trial since 1868,
accusing President Clinton of weaving a criminal ``web of deceit''
to hide his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Methodically laying out their case for his removal from office
to the 100 members of the Senate, the prosecution team of 13
Republicans urged senators to carry out the ``grave duty'' of
convicting Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice, insisting
it was their responsibility to excise ``cancer'' growing on ``the
body politic'' of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here today because William Jefferson Clinton decided to
use all means possible, both legal and illegal, to subvert the
truth about his conduct,'' said Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.,
who led off the House presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner outlined what he called a ``conspiracy of crimes''
by Clinton to prevent justice in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
lawsuit against him and to thwart independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's subsequent investigation of his relationship with Lewinsky.
The Jones lawsuit has been settled for more than $850,000, and the
House rejected articles of impeachment directly related to that
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did was criminal time and time again,'' Sensenbrenner
said, charging that Clinton not only lied under oath to a federal
grand jury about his affair with Lewinsky but also sought to
influence the testimony of his aides and friends to subvert the
independent counsel's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``At its core, the issues involved are basic questions of right
versus wrong _ deceptive, criminal behavior versus honesty,
integrity and respect for the law,'' Sensenbrenner said. ``These
are impeachable offenses for which the president should be
convicted.''
</P>
<P>
   The House presentation included videotape replays of Clinton
taking the oath of office and testifying and used colored charts
alleging a broad conspiracy to conceal evidence and keep the
Lewinsky relationship private.
</P>
<P>
   The presentations also sought to persuade senators that key
witnesses should be summoned, an issue at the core of heated debate
leading up to the trial. Senators will vote on allowing witnesses
after both sides have presented their opening presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Under rules adopted for the trial, senators were required to sit
silently at their polished, wooden desks Thursday and were not
allowed to object or ask questions. They rose occasionally to take
breaks or respond to messages delivered by Senate pages.
</P>
<P>
   A few senators who spoke with reporters during one of two
15-minute breaks in the six-hour proceeding said they were less
than mesmerized by the opening presentation, which covered no new
ground in the case and provided little in the way of drama.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors also provided little in the way of salacious
detail, heeding Senate admonitions to avoid explicit talk about the
Clinton-Lewinsky sexual encounters. But they did mention Lewinsky's
``DNA-stained dress'' several times to emphasize there was proof of
those encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., who depicted Clinton as little more
than a sexual predator who put a young White House employee in a
compromising position, also noted that ``the concept of a president
having sex in the Oval Office with an intern less than half his age
was a public relations disaster'' for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Senators, many of them lulled by the presentations, showed more
interest when Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., took to the well to make
the case for obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The former U.S. attorney used time-line charts and animated
arguments to emphasize what he said was a desperate attempt by
Clinton ``to plug up the holes in the dike'' as the truth about his
affair began to leak out. He contended that Clinton not only
instructed his secretary, Betty Currie, to retrieve gifts from
Lewinsky that could be traced to him, but he tried to twist her
memory of events to mesh with his own. He also enlisted the support
of his friend Vernon Jordan, Hutchinson said, to help find Lewinsky
a job to buy her silence.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson, whose brother Tim is a first-term senator from
Arkansas, also pleaded with senators to allow prosecutors to call
Lewinsky as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say in your mind, `well, I'm not going to believe her,'
then you should, first, give us the opportunity to present this
witness so that you, as jurors, can fairly and honestly determine
her credibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the oral arguments began, Clinton was in northern Virginia
promoting a new crime prevention plan he hopes to unveil in his
State of the Union address Tuesday. He had planned an overnight
stay in New York, where he was to deliver a speech to investors and
attend an event with the Rev. Jesse Jackson. But the trip was
canceled because of bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left it to his lawyers to observe the proceedings. Led
by White House Counsel Charles C. Ruff, the seven-member team sat
at a long table on the Republican side of the aisle as prosecutors
presented their case.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Clinton's private lawyer, James E. Kennedy, called
the prosecution's case ``unsubstantiated and circumstantial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is there is no case for the removal of the
president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic senators agreed, saying the House prosecution's
case seemed to rest primarily on the Jones case, which was
dismissed by the courts before Clinton reached a settlement with
her.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers will present their defense of the president
beginning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's court of impeachment was convened last week after
the House presented two articles of impeachment charging that
Clinton committed perjury last year in his Aug. 17 grand jury
testimony in the Starr inquiry and obstructed justice in his
efforts to conceal his affair with Lewinsky. The House approved the
articles by votes largely along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   In order to remove him from office, which would make him the
first president to be ousted for an impeachable offense,
two-thirds, or 67 members, of the Senate would have to vote to
convict on one or both charges.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution is to continue its presentation Friday and will
likely wrap up Saturday. Senate leaders have said they would like
to finish by the end of this month or early February. But that
depends on whether the Senate agrees to a motion the prosecutors
plan to file asking to call Lewinsky, Currie, Jordan and possibly
the president as witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill, the lead
prosecutor in the case, said he was considering calling the
president to testify and some Senate GOP leaders suggested he might
be invited.
</P>
<P>
   But White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said Hyde's
suggestion that Clinton be subpoenaed as a witness ``illustrated
that this is really about ... revenge politics.'' He said there was
enough testimony in the record for the Senate to reach a decision.
</P>
<P>
   In their response to the opening proceedings, White House
officials took issue with statements made by Sensenbrenner in his
opening arguments. The congressman made several factual errors in
referring to the Jones case, and he also misstated a comment that
one of Clinton's lawyers made during his appearance at the House
impeachment hearings last month.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart suggested it was just another example of Republican
efforts to get the president, no matter what it takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the founders intended a party that is in the
majority in the Congress would remove a president at their whim
based on partisan political differences,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde reminded senators of the importance of the oath all
politicians take when assuming public office. He said failure to
convict Clinton would render the vow meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of the Senate, what you do over the next few weeks
will forever affect the meaning of those two words ``I do,''' he
said. ``Depending on what you decide, it will either be
strengthened in its power to achieve justice or it will go the way
of so much of our moral infrastructure and become a mere
convention, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.''

 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an atmosphere of sober formality, the
impeachment trial of President William Jefferson Clinton began in
earnest on Thursday in the U.S. States Senate, with the Republican
prosecution asserting that he should be removed from office because
of ``egregious and criminal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No man is above the law, and no man is below it,'' said Rep.
James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin a few moments after the gavel
fell, quoting President Theodore Roosevelt. Clinton was on trial,
Sensenbrenner said, because he ``decided to put himself above the
law not once, not twice, but repeatedly,'' to conceal his sexual
affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting as jurors in the momentous and divisive case, only the
second presidential impeachment trial in the history of the
Republic, the 100 members of the Senate listened in silence for six
hours as five Republican members of the House began laying out the
evidence. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, presiding, confined
himself to scripted procedural comments.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gray January day, with a freezing drizzle falling
intermittently outside. A tone of undertstatement was set at the
outset, when Rehnquist opened the proceedings with two laconic
sentences: ``The Senate will convene as a court of impoeachment.
The chaplain will offer a prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself was absent, traveling to Alexandria, Va., across
the Potomac River, to promote crime prevention. He had planned to
go on to Wall Street, to encourage brokers to invest more in
minority business, but put off the trip until Friday because of bad
flying weather.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most forceful argument was made by Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, from Clinton's home state, Arkansas. A former U.S.
attorney (and the brother of Sen. Tim Hutchinson), he used
effective graphics and careful organization to develop more clearly
than before the evidence that led House Republicans to vote an
article of impeachment charging obstruction of justice. From a
myriad of familiar details, he assembled coherent patterns and
chronologies and then drew potentially damaging conclusions from
them as to motive and credibility and relevance.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every turn,'' Hutchinson said of Clinton, ``he used
whatever means available to him to evade the truth, destroy
evidence, tamper with witnesses and any other action required to
prevent evidence coming forth that would prove a truth contrary to
the president's interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Worried that Ms. Lewinsky would expose their relationship,
Clinton and his aides engaged in ``what became a frenzied and
concerted effort to keep the holes plugged in the dike,''
Hutchinson added.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the inflammatory language that marked the
House hearings was absent, although Sensenbrenner, in an allusion
to the Watergate case, spoke of the need to excise ``a cancer on
the body politic.'' There were also what seemed to be occasional
misstatements and overstatements in tne material presented by the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner, for example, made a point in his opening of
saying that Charles Ruff, a lawyer for the president, did not
answer ``directly,'' when he was asked in a House hearing, ``Did
the president lie during his sworn grand jury testimony?'' Gregory
B. Craig, another of Clinton's lawyers, said Thursday night that
``Mr. Sensenbrenner falsely characterized Mr. Ruff's testimony to
use it against the President, and he misled the Senate.'' He said
Sensenbrenner had asked Ruff if the president had ``told the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth'' when he testified
before the grand jury. Craig said, ``Mr. Ruff answered directly,
and I quote, `He surely did,' unquote.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the senators' deportment was much better than
the House members' had been. Most stayed in their seats, unwontedly
mute, sipping water, taking notes. A few stretched their backs
occasionally, as did Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   The decorum in the chamber suggested that after months of false
denouements, everyone realized that the last act of the drama had
begun.
</P>
<P>
   But the stream of partisanship flowed relentlessly outside, with
Democrats accusing the Senate Republicans of procedural
double-dealing. The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, insisted
again that the House case was based not on law but on political
revenge. And the House Republicans kept pressing, whenever they got
the chance, for the right to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson and the other prosecutors wove into their
presentations strong pleas that witnesses be called to testify,
including Ms. Lewinsky. At one point, Hutchinson said that he hoped
to be able to question Clinton's confidant, Vernon Jordan, under
oath about his role in securing a job for Ms. Lewinsky at precisely
the time that she was pondering whether to execute a false
affidavit that supported the president's testimony in the sexual
harassment suit filed by Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   With Jordan on the stand, Hutchinson said, ``You would need to
probe where his loyalties lie, listen to the tone of his voice,
look into his eyes and determine the truthfulness of his
statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson also suggested four other witnesses: Betty Currie,
Clinton's private secretary; John Podesta, the White House chief of
staff; Sidney Blumenthal, another presidential aide, and Clinton
himself. Lockhart immediately dismissed that last possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The witness question has been deferred until after the opening
statements. Thursday was the first of three days allotted to the
House Republican prosecutors. After a break on Sunday and Monday,
Martin Luther King Day, the president's lawyers, who listened
silently if intently on Thursday, will have three days to lay out
their rebuttal, and the senators will have two days to pose
questions, through the chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Senate will reach a crossroads. It must decide not only
whether to call witnesses but also whether to proceed any further
with the trial. The vote on witnesses or other new evidence will
come second, and not at all if the motion to end the trial carries.
Those votes require only simple majorities, not the two-thirds vote
needed to convict.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was 1:04 p.m., four minutes late, when the session began on
Thursday. The first prosecutor to speak was Rep. Henry J. Hyde of
Illinois, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. The public
galleries, accommodating only 50 people at a time, were full.
Officially, the prosecutors are referred to as ``managers,'' and
Rehnquist called upon him as ``Mr. Manager Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have pledged to put aside personal bias and partisan
interest and to do impartial justice,'' Hyde adminished the
senators, although they are in fact free to vote as they choose for
whatever reasons they chose or for no stated reason at all, without
regard to the usual rules of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he and his 12 colleagues on the panel of managers
were there ``as advocates for the rule of law, for equal justice
under the law and for the sanctity of the oath.'' Then he named the
other 12, all committee members, stated their legal qualifications
and made way for Sensenbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing beneath the marble dais on which Rehnquist sat in a
high-backed leather chair, resplendent in his black gown with four
gold stripes on each sleeve, Sensenbrenner said the president was
guilty of ``impeachable offenses,'' but he did not venture far into
the political and legal quagmire of exactly what constitutes an
impeachable offense. The definition was purposely left imprecise by
the founding fathers, and the Senate will eventually have to flesh
it out. The prosecutors will make their case on that issue on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN START HERE)
</P>
<P>
   But the Wisconsin lawmaker did note that the Constitution listed
bribery as an impeachable offence and that perjury carries an
identical penalty under the federal guideline. He said that
``perjury is the twin brother of bribery'' and hence one of the
``high crimes and misdemeanors'' meant by the framers.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner commended Clinton for having confessed to an
improper relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, then a 21-year-old White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
   But he continued, in a flat Midwestern monotone that belied the
high drama of the occasion: ``He has not owned up to the false
testimony, the stonewalling and legal hairsplitting and obstructing
the courts from finding the truth. In doing so, he has turned his
affair into a public wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Next came Rep. Ed Bryant of Tennessee, charged with sketching in
the background of the events that led to the impeachment. Reaching
into the grab-bag of modern technology, he used a giant television
screen, erected in the Senate for the first time, to project the
image of Clinton taking the oath of office as president and
pledging to uphold the nation's laws.
</P>
<P>
   A certain ennui had settled over the chamber by the time he
finished. Nothing new was being said, and the old things were not
being said with either eloquence or color. But Hutchinson changed
the mood, as did Rep. James E. Rogan of California, who followed
him to spell out in exhaustive detail the Republicans' several
allegations of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson made a number of points that seemed telling, though
it was not possible to tell whether they had any impact on the
senators.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has made much of the fact that Ms. Lewinsky's
job search started well before it was known that she was on the
Jones witness list. But Hutchinson was able to show that the search
gained urgency only in the hours immediately after the president
learned on Dec. 10 that she was on the list. Before that, by
Jordan's own testimony, it had a low priority.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson also noted that her denial of a sexual relationship
in an affidavit Clinton suggested she make came before the judge in
the Jones case defined a sexual relationship. It should therefore
be construed as normal _ not legal _ language, Hutchinsion
suggested, and therefore a lie that the president encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   He did not mention, however, that Clinton testified that he
thought she could file a truthful document and that he never saw
what she did file until later.

HEBRON'S RETURNS ARE A PLUS FOR DENVER
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ This is the way the Broncos kickoff returner Vaughn
Hebron describes the Jets:
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a talented team that had a rough time early. That
built character. Then they survived that and had some success _ but
that didn't go to their heads. They are confident now and they
realize the sky is the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like Hebron talking about himself.
</P>
<P>
   He was a star running back at Baltimore's Cardinal Gibbons High
and then at Virginia Tech but was not drafted in 1993. He signed as
free agent with the Philadelphia Eagles but was cut after the third
season. He went to Denver in 1996 and began having success in the
kick-return game. Won a Super Bowl ring last year. Recently made a
TV commercial for NFL Films. Has his own local TV show before
Broncos games. But none of that success has gone to his head. He is
confident now.
</P>
<P>
   He realizes the sky is the limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every championship team has players on it who could start for
other teams _ that's what helps to make them a championship team,''
Hebron said. ``Here, I'm a backup running back. I return kickoffs.
You can't win if people don't accept their role and understand
their role. I know mine.''
</P>
<P>
   And that makes Hebron dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   He is dangerous because the Jets-Denver battle for the American
Football Conference championship here Sunday will be greatly
affected by special teams and field position. With all other things
being equal, where you start your drives and if you can get points
out of special teams is decisive in any game, but especially in big
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets and Broncos are two teams who completely understand
this. Both teams begin their practices with special-teams drills.
Both emphasize field position, and it shows.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's average starting point for its drives is its 33-yard
line; for the Jets, it's the 29-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Denver averages 10.6 yards gained per punt return; the Jets
average 7.3.
</P>
<P>
   Denver averages 24.2 yards gained per kickoff return; the Jets
average 22.5.
</P>
<P>
   In only three Broncos seasons, Hebron, 28, has become the team's
all-time leader in kickoff returns (134) and in kickoff return
yards (3,324). He learned on the run. He was always a running back
first before arriving in Denver, but the Broncos said: ``Do this.
Return kicks.'' And he did.
</P>
<P>
   And he has done it exceptionally well, never mind that he is 5
foot 8 and 192 pounds, considered small by pro football standards.
Against Miami late in the regular season, he returned a kickoff 95
yards for a touchdown. It was the first time a Bronco had returned
a kickoff for a touchdown since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got to Philadelphia, I was a free agent beating
out backs who they had drafted in the second and third rounds,''
Hebron said. ``People were asking questions in the front office.
How could this happen? What are we doing in the scouting
department? I don't think I was ever a favorite of some people in
management there because I was not one of their choices, not one of
their guys. I played two years for Rich Kotite and then one year
for Ray Rhodes. And then they just let me go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here and found a different atmosphere. In our first
year under Mike Shanahan, we tried to make the playoffs. In the
last two years, he started out by telling us in training camp that
if we don't win the Super Bowl, the season would be a failure.
Imagine that? That doesn't leave much room for error. But we have
accepted it as truth. We won it last year and that taste is so
special. We want it again and, to a man, everyone here will do
their roles to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebron's TV show here, performed along with Broncos cornerback
Ray Crockett, is called Little Big Men. It is for players no taller
than 5 foot 8 who have excelled across the league. Garrison Hearst
of the San Francisco 49ers has been saluted by Hebron and Crockett.
When Buffalo quarterback Doug Flutie exited the playoffs, there was
a moment of silence for him.
</P>
<P>
   Hebron, though, plans to stick around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole team does,'' Hebron said. ``We're hearing how hungry
the Jets are but we have experienced the Super Bowl and the feeling
of winning it and it is one we want again. Right now. We are so
focused. We just believe that in the long run we are going to make
the plays down the stretch that make the difference in this game
and get us back. That is our plan.''
</P>
<P>
   A swift return to Super Bowl glory.

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 17) 
(af) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYCAMORE, Ill. _ Breakfast has posed problems for some time now.
First the milkman stopped coming around. Then bacon and eggs were
deemed to be about as nutritious as bathtub gin. Butter, the reason
for making toast, became almost illicit. Oatmeal, naturally,
retained its virtue, proof that the secret to longevity is
cardboard.
</P>
<P>
   But the real problem with breakfast, whether it tastes sinful or
righteous, is that nobody has time for it. Even something as quick
and simple as making a bowl of cereal, it seems, is just not quick
and simple enough. At least that is the view at the Kellogg Co.,
which is promoting a breakfast-in-a-box that promises to save
precious seconds being frittered away in kitchens across America.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast Mates, a single-serving package complete with cereal,
milk, plastic spoon and bowl, vows liberation from the
time-consuming and tiresome task of walking to the cupboard and
silverware drawer, and the labor involved in pouring the flakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for today's busy family, a breakfast with virtually no
preparation, and, if you think about it, no cleanup,'' said Anthony
Hebron, a spokesman for Kellogg, the nation's biggest cereal maker,
in Battle Creek, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Hebron said consumer research had found that people have better
things to do in the morning than reach into the cupboard or rinse
dirty bowls.
</P>
<P>
   To determine precisely how much time and energy can be saved,
Money &AMP; Business brought together a focus group of serious cereal
eaters _ my four children.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them, Amanda Elizabeth, 8, and Nora, 5, were assigned the
task of opening and eating the single-serving cereal; the other
two, Harlan, 7, and Henry, 4, were to dine the old-fashioned way,
making cereal from a family-sized box and a gallon jug of milk, and
using regular bowls and spoons.
</P>
<P>
   The contest began at 12:45 p.m. on a Sunday. Using the clock
over the stove as a stopwatch, the routines would be timed to
compare their efficiency. With great fanfare, the contest was
called the Cereal Bowl; the contestants' mother, Margaret Shannon,
served as coach and referee, her customary role on the field.
</P>
<P>
   The brands selected were Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops _ in
both regular and Breakfast Mate boxes _ a big treat for children
accustomed to much cheaper off-brands. ``Wow!'' cheered Henry, his
eyes suddenly as bright as Las Vegas. ``These cereals have been on
the TV!''
</P>
<P>
   The old-fashioned approach took 14 seconds, from the instant the
cereal box was grasped to the first crunch of a spoonful. The new
method took 13 seconds: Everything must be unwrapped individually
and the bowl itself is sealed with paper that needs to be peeled
back.
</P>
<P>
   One thing was certain: Time was money. The single-serving box
cost $1.39. Prepared the traditional way, a cereal serving cost
28.8 cents, including the price of the milk. That means it cost $1
more to save a single second.
</P>
<P>
   The reviews were mixed. Harlan, who usually eats cereal in a
bowl large enough for a German shepherd, scoffed at Kellogg's idea
of a serving size: a three-quarter cup of cereal. ``To get filled
up,'' he said, ``you'd have to eat five boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nora, though, liked the small serving, which she applauded as
being kid-friendly. Speaking for ``5-year-olders,'' as she called
them, she said it was no fun to struggle with a big, heavy jug of
milk, especially if it toppled. ``This way, if you spill, you don't
spill so much,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda, who wore her bell-bottomed jeans embroidered with
flowers, was thinking mostly about the environment, as she often
does. She was not pleased. ``Look at all of the garbage on this
table,'' she said in exasperation, waving unhappily at a kitchen
table covered with plastic and cardboard. ``This is bad for the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Breakfast Mates in this contest came from a grocery store in
DeKalb, Ill., where the manager said sales were so poor that it did
not intend to carry it much longer. Hebron, the Kellogg spokesman,
described the sales in rather tepid terms, saying that the product
was ``holding its own,'' and that a new marketing push was gearing
up.
</P>
<P>
   In a new campaign, Kellogg will no doubt be looking for more
customers like Nora, who polished off her bowl, then folded her
arms in satisfaction across her bib overalls. ``I think it's
really, really cool that you don't have to get a spoon out of the
drawer,'' she said.

SNOW DAY IS FOR SURFING AS PUPILS PLAY ON INTERNET

<P>
   Hang up the sled. Put Scrabble back in the box. Surfing is the
new snow day activity of choice.
</P>
<P>
   That would be surfing on the Web, of course, not the water
(unless you want to try the moving waves on Go Surf,
www.geocities.com/TheTropics/4271/gallery.html).
</P>
<P>
   With industry experts estimating that more than 5 million
children nationwide have Internet access, a day of canceled classes
means clogged chat rooms and crowded cartoon Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Internet service providers estimate that use jumps more than 10
percent during the winter, and Bell Atlantic, whose phone lines
connect people to the Internet, reported swollen activity
throughout New York state Thursday, with the system logging its
average daily volume of 120 million calls by 5 p.m., barely
two-thirds of the way through the day.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that spike is probably from increased phone calls and
more adults working from home, two phenomena often associated with
stormy weather. But experts also believe it is partly because when
dozens of districts in the New York region declared a day off
Thursday, thousands of schoolchildren scrambled to their desks at
home to click the day away.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Mele, 15, a sophomore at Fairfield High School in
Connecticut, spent about three hours playing Half Life, a
three-dimensional interactive shooting game. Lisa Kravitz, 13, an
eighth-grader at Pelham Middle School in Westchester County, N.Y.,
went to www.gurl.com and looked up her horoscope. And a New Jersey
teen-ager scrolled the love-life advice boards and exchanged
instant messages with her friends, some of whom live just down the
block.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Berry of Darien, Conn., who has two sons, said, ``When you
and I were kids, we would talk to our friends all day at school and
then call them when we got home; they e-mail each other.'' Her
sons, Nicholas, 8, and Christopher, 11, exchanged computer messages
with friends Thursday morning to plan their snow-shoveling
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is nice to know that they're using their minds,'' Berry
said. ``A lot of these games are pretty hard. I think there's
educational value online. If there's no school, they're certainly
still using their writing skills and communication skills, and
hopefully picking up some education along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online's Ask the Teacher feature typically collects
about 6,000 homework questions a day. But e-mail is the top online
activity for children younger than 13, according to a recent survey
by Jupiter Communications, an Internet research company. Games and
surfing the Internet ranked second and third, and homework was
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really get frostbitten'' online, said Lisa, who
built a snowman Thursday before clicking on the computer. ``You
can't really get to many places'' in the snow, she said, ``and the
Internet's right here, and you can go all around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   On Teen People on Line, a popular site for children that can be
accessed through America Online, the ``Daily Buzz'' Thursday bore
the headline, ``Snowed in? Get Surfing.'' It suggested cuddling up
to the computer with a mug of cocoa and checking out sites to color
with virtual crayons (www.kidalex.com/index.html), get movie
reviews (www.girlsonfilm.com/film/navigation), and climb Mount
Everest _ virtually (www.everest.mountainzone.com/98).
</P>
<P>
   Karen-Kristie Prior, community manager of Teen People On Line,
said the normal peak period for her Web site is from 3 p.m. to
midnight. But in the winter, there are days with thousands of
postings between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason that it's popular is kids, they want to
talk to one another,'' Prior said. ``If they're not in school,
they're missing that social outlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, many children and teen-agers interviewed by
telephone and e-mail said they spent their snow day doing nothing
more exotic than chatting with friends on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually like talking to my friends on the computer more,''
Christopher Berry said. ``I just do. It's good because I can play
computer games while I'm talking to them on the Internet.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Democrats and Republicans, who sat silently
in their chamber seats at the opening of President Clinton's
impeachment trial Thursday, resumed their verbal brawl off the
Senate floor over whether to call witnesses, imperiling a fragile
bipartisan pact.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of
double-crossing them by directing a small group of Republican
senators to meet secretly with the House prosecutors and help them
devise criteria for determining whether witnesses would be called.
</P>
<P>
   All 100 senators agreed last Friday to postpone a vote on
whether to call witnesses until later this month, after
presentations from the House managers and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans shot back that Democrats had deliberately
rebuffed a belated invitation to join the talks as part of a
strategy to sharpen the partisan divide over witnesses and to paint
the Republican-controlled Senate as being as hostile as the House
is toward Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The witness issue remained central. Even as the House managers
wove appeals to permit witnesses throughout their oral arguments to
the senators Thursday, they made the same point in a detailed
rebuttal to the trial memorandum that the White House filed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that the president's trial memorandum ``raises
issues of credibility, those issues are best resolved by live
testimony subject to cross-examination,'' the House brief said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had no comment Thursday on the impeachment trial. Aides
said he spent much of the day working on his State of the Union
address, which he plans to deliver next Tuesday. But White House
press secretary Joe Lockhart was on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the founders intended a party that is in the
majority in the Congress could remove a president at their whim
based on partisan political differences,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized a suggestion by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the
head of the House prosecution team, that Clinton testify. ``I think
this late-hour request from Henry Hyde just once again illustrates
that this is really about politics,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever frail cooperative spirit created from last Friday's
unusual joint caucus seemed to be hanging by a thread, especially
after some Democrats also assailed Republicans for acting
complicitly in the House managers' decision this week to approach
two potential witnesses, Monica Lewinsky and Kathleen Willey, about
their possible testimony.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-hour party caucus that broke up shortly before
Thursday's opening arguments, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle
criticized the Republican-only meetings. ``It certainly violates
the spirit of the agreement we all agreed to last week,'' said
Daschle, who ordered Democrats to boycott the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., voiced concern that the Republican
meetings could undermine the Senate's earnest attempts to avoid the
clashes that split the House. ``This could lead to our making the
same awful mistakes that the House made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans defended both the meetings with the House
managers and the prosecutors' decision to set up informal talks
with Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Willey, the senators who met with the
prosecutors were divided over whether the gatherings should
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tempest in teapot, and I consider it over,'' said
Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., to reporters. ``I don't think there's
any further need to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sessions said the senators, including Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and
Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., made clear to the House managers that they needed
to winnow their wish list of 15 witnesses, and focus on those
witnesses who could resolve conflicting testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But Specter said in an interview that the House prosecutors'
opening arguments only underscored the need for witnesses, and that
the small Senate group would likely meet again with the House
managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be more meetings in the future,'' Specter
said during a break in the trial. ``My view is that there ought to
be standards, not only on the witnesses, but also on the scope of
their testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   With the prevailing wisdom that the Senate will not muster the
67 votes required by the Constitution to remove Clinton, the
question of whether to call witnesses is emerging as a more
divisive issue than acquittal or conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over in their 33-page filing, the House prosecutors
flatly dismissed the White House's efforts to explain away the
allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice leveled against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton's attorneys raise the issue of fairness,''
the House memo stated. ``They are entitled to their own opinion
about the House's proceedings, but they are not entitled to rewrite
history. The truth is that the committee's subpoena power could
have been used to subpoena documents or witnesses on behalf of the
president if they had so requested. They did not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All they requested, is that the lawyers, law professors and
historians testify before the committee,'' the memo continued. ``In
short, President Clinton's statements about what happened in the
House completely misstate what occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   The House managers concluded by urging the Senate to proceed to
a full trial, convict Clinton and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Off the Senate floor, Democrats and Republicans repeatedly
clashed over the witness issue, including the prosecutors' meeting
Monday with Ms. Willey, a former White House volunteer, and an
unsuccessful attempt by a House manager to arrange an informal
discussion with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything wrong with that,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah. ``They have to get to the bottom of this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said approaching Ms. Lewinsky on
the eve of the trial and using her refusal for ``some argumentative
or rhetorical purposes'' was ``disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators fired even stronger volleys at one another over the
Senate Republicans' meetings with the House prosecutors. ``I don't
think it's appropriate,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
``For a judge and juror to meet with one side before the
proceedings begin is not a fair way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans dismissed those objections and insisted that
last week's cooperation was not disappearing. ``It's akin to a
judge calling lawyers into his chambers before trial,'' said Sen.
Robert Bennett, R-Utah. ``The fact it was done openly and with an
invitation to Democrats indicates there was nothing malicious or
mysterious about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also questioned the impartiality of more than a
dozen Senate Democrats who heard a presentation from House
Democratic lawyers on the evidence against Clinton. Democrats said
the meeting, which was reported in Thursday's issue of The
Washington Times, was merely to review the accuracy of the House
impeachment record sent to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., one of the few Democrats who is open to
calling a limited number of witnesses, urged calm. ``There are
going to be a lot of bumps along the way,'' he said. ``But it's
especially important on the witness issue to keep the bipartisan
spirit. It's going to be a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton decided to cancel a trip Thursday
night to New York City because of icy weather conditions. But his
aides said he still planned to go to New York on Friday morning to
address the conference of the Wall Street Project of the Rev. Jesse
Jackson's Rainbow/Push Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to announce new programs intended to help poor and
rural communities, and will ask Congress to approve $1 billion in
tax credits and $608 million over five years, mostly in loan
guarantees, to spur development in poor urban areas like East
Harlem and poor rural areas like Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   The federal investment, Clinton's advisers said, is intended to
generate $15 billion in private capital over five or more years.
Some of the spending will go for existing programs, but the
president also plans to propose the creation of new private
investment partnerships called ``America's Private Investment
Companies.''

<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ When Miami Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson showed up
at his office early Thursday morning, he intended to resign. His
mother's death in December had left him thinking about how football
had taken so much time away from family and friends. And he wanted
to change that.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting outside his door was Dan Marino, the Dolphins' future
Hall of Fame quarterback. ``He said, `Coach, we are so close,' ''
Johnson said. `` `We are really close to getting to where we want
to be.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then Johnson, whose team finished at 11-7, including a 38-3
playoff loss to Denver, went in for a half-hour session with team
owner H. Wayne Huizenga, who had rushed back from San Diego on
Wednesday night when he heard that his coach might be quitting.
Huizenga knew of Johnson's fondness for working with Dave
Wannstedt, the recently fired Chicago Bears head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne said, `Why is it you can't just bring Dave in, and this
will allow you some time for your family and yet you've got the
quality of someone you respect as much if not more than anybody in
the NFL to fill your shoes on those days you're not there?' ''
Johnson said. ``The more we talked, the more it made sense.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew Wannstedt, an assistant under him in Dallas, would take
a job as the Dolphins' assistant head coach. Johnson then called
Rhonda Rookmaaker, whom he plans to marry soon. She gave her
blessing to his continuing as coach.
</P>
<P>
   And, Johnson said, she told him: ``Just because you're staying,
you're not off the hook. You're still marrying me.'' Johnson
chuckled at that Thursday, as he announced his intention to remain
the team's coach for at least another season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who is 28-22 in three seasons with the Dolphins, has
two years left on his contract, but he stopped short of assuring he
would fulfill it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say what's going to happen a year from now,'' the
55-year-old Johnson said at the Dolphins' Nova Southeastern
University base. ``I can't say what's going to happen 10 years from
now. You may be stuck with me forever. All I know is what I'm going
to do this year. And I'm going to coach like the dickens to get us
a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, South Florida was abuzz with talk of Johnson's
impending resignation. On the sports talk radio station WQAM, some
praised him, some mourned his departure and some ripped him for not
living up to his promise of putting Miami in the Super Bowl within
three seasons. For Johnson, it was a peek at how he might be
remembered here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I'm disappointed that we didn't win a championship,''
he said, ``I'm encouraged that we are very, very close. I honestly
believe we're a couple of playmakers away from getting to that
championship. Right now, we have a young, talented team. We'll have
more money under the cap next year than probably anybody in the
league. We've got 43 or 44 players under contract and 15 more
tendered.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson acknowledged dealing with guilt about devoting his life
to coaching and not giving much time to friends and family. He said
the death of his mother, Allene, ``opened up my eyes as far as me
realizing I need to spend some time with people I care about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my early days, it cost me time with my two sons,'' he said.
``It cost me a marriage. And I could see some of these same things
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice cracked when he talked about not visiting his mother's
casket the day before her funeral. ``My sons were there,'' he
struggled to say. ``There's a time that you pull back and you say,
`Be with some people who care about you. Don't shortchange them.
They care about you, they love you. They're supportive in
everything that you do. Give just a little bit back.' And that's
what I plan on doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson paused, thinking that he might be misunderstood as
someone who had lost his edge as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure this is clear,'' he said. ``My commitment
and my resolve and my efforts, they are not diminished one bit. If
anything, with another person here that I care about, I feel even
more responsibility in getting the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he might not reduce his workload by even one hour,
but he wanted the flexibility to do so. ``I think I can be a better
football coach,'' he said. ``I can be more relaxed. I can be more
upbeat and positive if I have a good family life.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who might be tempted to criticize him, he revealed part
of what would have been his resignation speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready to say this morning that people should not be
disheartened because the best thing in the world is to be the coach
who follows Jimmy Johnson,'' he said. ``Ask Pat Jones who told over
at Oklahoma State. Or ask Dennis Erickson, who won a couple of
championships at Miami. Or ask Barry Switzer, who won a Super Bowl
at Dallas. So it wasn't the worst thing in the world to follow
me.''

U.S. PROPOSES EASING U.N. CURBS ON IRAQ OIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under pressure from members of the U.N. Security
Council to find ways to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi
people, the Clinton administration Thursday proposed ending the
restrictions on how much oil Iraq can export in order to pay for
relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal came the day after France unveiled a more sweeping
plan at the United Nations that would entirely lift the oil
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement by the State Department, essentially a
relaxation of the terms of what is known as the oil-for-food
program, also follows efforts among some Arab countries to relax
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the U.S. plan is the removal of a $5.2 billion
ceiling that is placed on the sales of Iraqi oil every six months,
the proceeds of which can be used by the Iraqi government to buy
food, medicine and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
   But because of its rundown oil production system, Iraq has been
able to muster only about $3.5 billion in oil sales every six
months. And much of the food and medicine bougt with the revenues
has not been distributed and lies unused in warehouses,
administration officials said. So ending the oil limit would not
necessarily get much more food and medicine to the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department went out of its way Thursday to stress that
the proposal, which would need to be passed by the security
council, was not a lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``All present controls on the collection and disbursement of
revenues generated by the sale of oil would remain in place,'' the
State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin was careful to draw the distinction between what he called
the administration's ``narrow program'' and that of the French.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking at how can we get to a point where Iraq
provides the necessary work on the disarmament and
weapons-of-mass-destruction side so that there can be action on the
formal sanctions process,'' Rubin said. ``We are concerned that the
French proposal does not take fully into account the fact that Iraq
has not fulfilled the requirements the security council laid out
with respect to past programs to disarm.''
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated the American position that sanctions could not be
lifted until Iraqi arms programs were destroyed and the disarmament
was verified by the security council.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference between the American and French proposals is
their treatment of an escrow account into which the Iraqis must now
deposit their oil revenues; they then must get security council
approval to spend the money on an approved list of supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The French propose scrapping the escrow account, which the
United States regards as the most rigorous way of checking how
Baghdad spends the money.
</P>
<P>
   In its plan, France suggests continuing the ban on all arms
sales to Iraq and all imports of other materials that can be used
for both military and civilian projects. All other Iraqi purchases
would be made freely without monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   On the inspection side, the French proposed replacing the United
Nations arms inspections commission with a ``renewed control
commission'' that would be stripped of any investigative powers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the American and British air strikes against Iraq last
month and disclosures about the U.N. inspection system's being used
for intelligence other than for disarmament, discussion has been
building at the United Nations about relaxing sanctions and
introducing a new inspections method. Iraq has said it will not
permit the return of United Nations arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has said it wants to retain the existing
system and the right to use military strikes to enforce it. By
tackling the issue of relief supplies and alleviating the suffering
of the Iraqi people, the administration has struck a chord that is
popular in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which
consists of the major oil-exporting countries, proposals were
discussed that would lighten some of the sanctions but not go as
far as the French offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab League is expected to meet on Jan. 24 to discuss Iraqi
sanctions. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is scheduled to
visit Egypt and Saudi Arabia at the end of the month to bolster
Arab efforts against President Saddam Hussein.

SHARES CONTINUE TO FALL; DOW DROPS 228.63

 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks fell for a fourth consecutive session Thursday
as fears intensified that Brazil's financial turmoil, reflected in
the devaluation of its currency, might spread to other Latin
economies and dampen business with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Wednesday's session, when blue-chip stocks recovered more
than half of their losses during the day, prices rallied only
mildly in late trading Thursday, not enough to keep the Dow Jones
industrial average from slipping into negative territory for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is on the brink and Argentina may follow,'' said Neil
Eigen, managing director at J&AMP;W Seligman. ``The realization is
taking hold that the United States doesn't go it on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   As is usual on word of foreign distress, shares of banks and
other financial companies were prominent casualties because of
possibly soured loans and losses in securities trading. J.P. Morgan
lost 4 9/16 a share, to 102; Suntrust fell 3 9/16, to 72 11/16;
Chase Manhattan was down 3 3/8, to 68 1/4; Mellon dropped 3 1/4, to
65 1/8, and Citigroup fell 1 5/16, to 50 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also said the start of the impeachment trial of
President Clinton contributed to the wider market decline, noting
that the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which had stabilized
for more than 90 minutes, resumed its slump as television coverage
began at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took buyers away and brought in some nervous selling,''
said Fane Lozman of Scanshift, a research company in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   At the close, the Dow was at 9,120.93, down 228.63 points, or
2.45 percent, its worst point loss since Sept. 30. That brought the
two-day damage to 353.75 points, or 3.7 percent. The Dow is now
down six-tenths of 1 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 fell 22.21 points Thursday, or 1.8 percent, to
1,212.19, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 39.99 points, or
1.73 percent, to 2,276.82. The S&AMP;P 500 is down 1.39 percent for the
year, but Nasdaq is still up 3.84 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign markets, which were severely battered on Wednesday,
ended mixed, but Brazil's Bovespa suffered much of its pounding _
nearly 10 percent _ after European markets had closed.
</P>
<P>
   Market analysts said high valuations had made the market
particularly susceptible to shocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a market correction inspired by the Brazilian crisis,
added to by the presidential impeachment,'' said John Shaughnessy,
chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. in Boston. But he said
the pullback was probably healthy, ``squeezing euphoria out of the
market'' while not seriously threatening American business.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also took note of the very solid U.S. economy,
confirmed in Thursday's government reports of a surprisingly big
rise in retail sales for December and almost nonexistent consumer
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 30 component stocks of Dow industrials, the biggest
loser by far was Eastman Kodak, which plunged 8 3/16, to 70 1/2, as
the company posted fourth-quarter profits that were lower than
expected. Kodak accounted for more than 30 points of the drop in
the Dow, whose only gainer was General Electric, which rose 1/2, to
97 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   No major sectors escaped punishment, but some analysts said they
were impressed that high-flying Internet stocks, which have become
increasingly difficult to trade, held up relatively well.
</P>
<P>
   While Yahoo fell 23 15/16 a share, to 344 1/16, and Amazon.com
fell 10, to 138, other Internet stocks surged. Ebay and Ubid, two
auction companies, climbed; Ebay jumped 9 13/16 a share, to 225
5/16; Ubid rose 3 7/16, to 91 1/2. America Online, another recent
star, eased 1 1/4, to 144 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   And the Russell 2000, an index comprising small-company stocks,
was 1.12 percent lower, less than half the decline of the Dow.

SCORING POINTS, WITH EYE ON REGENTS EXAM  (Eds: see also By KIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Damien Daniels, a 5-foot-10 inch guard for West Side
High School's basketball team, routinely stops nearly at midcourt
and hurls the ball up. The first time he does this in a game, and
makes it, opposing coaches and players think it must be a fluke.
Then he does it again, and only then do they realize that they must
guard Daniels all the way from halfcourt because even there he is a
threat. He averaged 40 points a game last year and has averaged 35
points a game this season.
</P>
<P>
   But making jump shots from 30 feet look easy is one thing. Doing
it for West Side High in Manhattan is another. Daniels attends a
school that has no gymnasium, no basketball court, no locker room,
no cheerleaders, no pep band, no pep rallies and _ because it has
no home court _ no fans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The team is routinely kicked off its rented practice court about
a mile from the school in midtown whenever a more important renter
comes along _ most recently a book fair. Heading for practice in a
public park means fishing a basketball from the closet in the back
of the classroom of the basketball coach, Ed Beller, and dribbling
the ball down Eighth Avenue in midtown, hoping that the public
courts are not all taken by afternoon pickup games.
</P>
<P>
   But now Daniels, a 19-year-old senior from the Washington
Heights neighborhood, is facing what may be an even greater
challenge than playing ball for a New York City high school:
graduating from one. He has been offered a four-year basketball
scholarship to Wagner College on Staten Island, and to accept it,
he must pass his state Regents examinations this month. Social
studies and history will be problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm studying for them _ I feel like I'm going to pass them,''
Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Daniels over the bar for high school graduation, which
was raised last year by the State Legislature, has turned Beller,
who is also an English teacher, into Daniels' tutor. Every day
during third period, coach and athlete stop everything and meet in
Beller's classroom for a one-on-one drill of what the Regents tests
call Global Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going crazy trying to help,'' Beller said. ``Damien is a
very, very likable kid _ very decent.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, the youngest of three boys, learned basketball from his
older brothers and has played in organized leagues since he was 13.
As a sophomore, he was named to the all-city team at Martin Luther
King High School. But his grades have been a struggle. He
transferred from Martin Luther King to a school in upstate New York
after his sophomore year, then came to West Side, an alternative
school for students who have had trouble in more traditional high
school settings, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, interviewed on a park bench during a recent outdoor
practice at a court in Chelsea, said he wanted to play professional
basketball, study business and make something of himself. He
believes he can do all those things. He knows he can. Some things
are just harder than others, though, like history. ``First, I've
got to graduate,'' he said.

A KINDER, GENTLER JIMMY TALKS FAMILY-FIRST APPROACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Jimmy Johnson suddenly a family-first kind
of guy. Unheard of, unless you meant those guppies in his aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   And continuing on the strange side, there was Jimmy yesterday,
also going public with his plans for a soon-to-be marriage.
Remember the story of his last wife _ after arriving in Dallas, he
put her on ``waivers,'' saying in the NFL you don't need one of
those things.
</P>
<P>
   And then, in maybe the most shocking development, Jimmy
announced he would now be sharing what has long been his death-grip
obsession _ ultimate authority of a football team.
</P>
<P>
   The Jimster, obviously, was full of surprises in Miami
yesterday. About the only curveball he didn't throw was naming
Jerry Jones best man for the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, of course, makes sense, starting with the breaking
story out of Miami Wednesday night that Johnson had resigned after
three years of coaching the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Due to a Cowboys record that stands alone, Jimmy is a North
Texas icon, which doesn't mean he lacks for haters around here.
Some of those are media members who sided with the Jones-Gunsmoke
element.
</P>
<P>
   What will be heard from them is all of the above is fraudulent,
meaning the ``resignation'' for family and marriage reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was. I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   But those same whining local voices also squeal with indignation
over anyone who would question the sudden religious transformation
of Nine-Toed Deion. How could anyone doubt this fine human being _
that's what they ask people like me.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, within the Dolphins' compound, those closest to
Jimmy claim the resignation was a certainty on Wednesday night. And
that what changed Johnson's mind was an emergency meeting yesterday
morning with team owner Wayne Huizenga.
</P>
<P>
   One source within the organization said Huizenga would not take
resigning for an answer. When Johnson told the owner he simply had
to spend more time with his family, Huizenga even went as far as
telling Johnson not to take Dolphins' road trips next season.
Huizenga was offering any concession to keep Johnson as head
coach-general manager.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson finally agreed to come back, he was as peppy as
ever at a media conference yesterday where long-time pal Dave
Wannstedt was introduced as the assistant head coach of the
Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Just fired as the head coach in Chicago, Wannstedt will not
resume the defensive coordinator duty he had under Johnson in
Dallas. Nor will Wannstedt be a position coach. He will answer to
Johnson, but have the same head coaching responsibilities, meaning
it's the most unique job in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   This way, Johnson claimed, he would attempt to carve out more
quality family time with his two sons, his
girlfriend-soon-to-be-wife, and with his father, who is suffering
from cancer. Johnson's father will move from Jimmy's hometown in
Port Arthur to the new Johnson estate in the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   This is a long, long way from the Jimmy Johnson we all knew in
Dallas. Then, his top three priorities in life were football and
Jimmy, football and Jimmy and, yes, football and Jimmy. That was
followed by his girlfriend, his two adult sons, his father and
mother in Port Arthur, his pet fish, playing high-stakes blackjack
at various casinos and the dream of someday retiring to a beach in
the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, family-first didn't come first.
</P>
<P>
   What changed Johnson? Those who know him best say the death of
his mother a month ago shook Jimmy like they had never seen him
shaken. Johnson admitted at yesterday's media conference that
missing the funeral home viewing the night before his mother's
funeral (which he attended) ``was not right.'' But again, he was
consumed at the time with important football duties.
</P>
<P>
   After that, say his friends, Johnson privately talked of
something they never dreamed he would consider _ retirement.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, nagging football questions involved in all
this.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jimmy realizing his restoration of the Dolphins was going
slower than expected. That he played in a division _ the AFC East _
which has suddenly toughened into maybe the NFL's best. That his
friend, Bill Parcells, has the Jets ahead of the Dolphins, both now
and in the future. And that while Johnson personally likes Dan
Marino, he has never believed the veteran quarterback is the answer
to rebuilding the Dolphins into a run-first team.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement may have been a football answer. But if the
family-first approach is serious, can Jimmy be Jimmy if he's not
totally consumed with football?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, Johnson now remains in Miami for at least one more
season. You don't have to believe his answers from yesterday, but
if true, he's a better man, which ranks higher in importance than
being a famous football coach.

REPUBLICAN MANAGERS BEGIN PRESENTING THEIR CASE AGAINST CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to delete final graf.)  (sw) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an atmosphere of sober formality, the
impeachment trial of President William Jefferson Clinton began in
earnest on Thursday in the U.S. States Senate, with the Republican
prosecution asserting that he should be removed from office because
of ``egregious and criminal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No man is above the law, and no man is below it,'' said Rep.
James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin a few moments after the gavel
fell, quoting President Theodore Roosevelt. Clinton was on trial,
Sensenbrenner said, because he ``decided to put himself above the
law not once, not twice, but repeatedly,'' to conceal his sexual
affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting as jurors in the momentous and divisive case, only the
second presidential impeachment trial in the history of the
Republic, the 100 members of the Senate listened in silence for six
hours as five Republican members of the House began laying out the
evidence. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, presiding, confined
himself to scripted procedural comments.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gray January day, with a freezing drizzle falling
intermittently outside. A tone of undertstatement was set at the
outset, when Rehnquist opened the proceedings with two laconic
sentences: ``The Senate will convene as a court of impoeachment.
The chaplain will offer a prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself was absent, traveling to Alexandria, Va., across
the Potomac River, to promote crime prevention. He had planned to
go on to Wall Street, to encourage brokers to invest more in
minority business, but put off the trip until Friday because of bad
flying weather.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most forceful argument was made by Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, from Clinton's home state, Arkansas. A former U.S.
attorney (and the brother of Sen. Tim Hutchinson), he used
effective graphics and careful organization to develop more clearly
than before the evidence that led House Republicans to vote an
article of impeachment charging obstruction of justice. From a
myriad of familiar details, he assembled coherent patterns and
chronologies and then drew potentially damaging conclusions from
them as to motive and credibility and relevance.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every turn,'' Hutchinson said of Clinton, ``he used
whatever means available to him to evade the truth, destroy
evidence, tamper with witnesses and any other action required to
prevent evidence coming forth that would prove a truth contrary to
the president's interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Worried that Ms. Lewinsky would expose their relationship,
Clinton and his aides engaged in ``what became a frenzied and
concerted effort to keep the holes plugged in the dike,''
Hutchinson added.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the inflammatory language that marked the
House hearings was absent, although Sensenbrenner, in an allusion
to the Watergate case, spoke of the need to excise ``a cancer on
the body politic.'' There were also what seemed to be occasional
misstatements and overstatements in tne material presented by the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner, for example, made a point in his opening of
saying that Charles Ruff, a lawyer for the president, did not
answer ``directly,'' when he was asked in a House hearing, ``Did
the president lie during his sworn grand jury testimony?'' Gregory
B. Craig, another of Clinton's lawyers, said Thursday night that
``Mr. Sensenbrenner falsely characterized Mr. Ruff's testimony to
use it against the President, and he misled the Senate.'' He said
Sensenbrenner had asked Ruff if the president had ``told the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth'' when he testified
before the grand jury. Craig said, ``Mr. Ruff answered directly,
and I quote, `He surely did,' unquote.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the senators' deportment was much better than
the House members' had been. Most stayed in their seats, unwontedly
mute, sipping water, taking notes. A few stretched their backs
occasionally, as did Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   The decorum in the chamber suggested that after months of false
denouements, everyone realized that the last act of the drama had
begun.
</P>
<P>
   But the stream of partisanship flowed relentlessly outside, with
Democrats accusing the Senate Republicans of procedural
double-dealing. The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, insisted
again that the House case was based not on law but on political
revenge. And the House Republicans kept pressing, whenever they got
the chance, for the right to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson and the other prosecutors wove into their
presentations strong pleas that witnesses be called to testify,
including Ms. Lewinsky. At one point, Hutchinson said that he hoped
to be able to question Clinton's confidant, Vernon Jordan, under
oath about his role in securing a job for Ms. Lewinsky at precisely
the time that she was pondering whether to execute a false
affidavit that supported the president's testimony in the sexual
harassment suit filed by Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   With Jordan on the stand, Hutchinson said, ``You would need to
probe where his loyalties lie, listen to the tone of his voice,
look into his eyes and determine the truthfulness of his
statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson also suggested four other witnesses: Betty Currie,
Clinton's private secretary; John Podesta, the White House chief of
staff; Sidney Blumenthal, another presidential aide, and Clinton
himself. Lockhart immediately dismissed that last possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The witness question has been deferred until after the opening
statements. Thursday was the first of three days allotted to the
House Republican prosecutors. After a break on Sunday and Monday,
Martin Luther King Day, the president's lawyers, who listened
silently if intently on Thursday, will have three days to lay out
their rebuttal, and the senators will have two days to pose
questions, through the chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Senate will reach a crossroads. It must decide not only
whether to call witnesses but also whether to proceed any further
with the trial. The vote on witnesses or other new evidence will
come second, and not at all if the motion to end the trial carries.
Those votes require only simple majorities, not the two-thirds vote
needed to convict.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was 1:04 p.m., four minutes late, when the session began on
Thursday. The first prosecutor to speak was Rep. Henry J. Hyde of
Illinois, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. The public
galleries, accommodating only 50 people at a time, were full.
Officially, the prosecutors are referred to as ``managers,'' and
Rehnquist called upon him as ``Mr. Manager Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have pledged to put aside personal bias and partisan
interest and to do impartial justice,'' Hyde adminished the
senators, although they are in fact free to vote as they choose for
whatever reasons they chose or for no stated reason at all, without
regard to the usual rules of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he and his 12 colleagues on the panel of managers
were there ``as advocates for the rule of law, for equal justice
under the law and for the sanctity of the oath.'' Then he named the
other 12, all committee members, stated their legal qualifications
and made way for Sensenbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing beneath the marble dais on which Rehnquist sat in a
high-backed leather chair, resplendent in his black gown with four
gold stripes on each sleeve, Sensenbrenner said the president was
guilty of ``impeachable offenses,'' but he did not venture far into
the political and legal quagmire of exactly what constitutes an
impeachable offense. The definition was purposely left imprecise by
the founding fathers, and the Senate will eventually have to flesh
it out. The prosecutors will make their case on that issue on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN START HERE)
</P>
<P>
   But the Wisconsin lawmaker did note that the Constitution listed
bribery as an impeachable offence and that perjury carries an
identical penalty under the federal guideline. He said that
``perjury is the twin brother of bribery'' and hence one of the
``high crimes and misdemeanors'' meant by the framers.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner commended Clinton for having confessed to an
improper relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, then a 21-year-old White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
   But he continued, in a flat Midwestern monotone that belied the
high drama of the occasion: ``He has not owned up to the false
testimony, the stonewalling and legal hairsplitting and obstructing
the courts from finding the truth. In doing so, he has turned his
affair into a public wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Next came Rep. Ed Bryant of Tennessee, charged with sketching in
the background of the events that led to the impeachment. Reaching
into the grab-bag of modern technology, he used a giant television
screen, erected in the Senate for the first time, to project the
image of Clinton taking the oath of office as president and
pledging to uphold the nation's laws.
</P>
<P>
   A certain ennui had settled over the chamber by the time he
finished. Nothing new was being said, and the old things were not
being said with either eloquence or color. But Hutchinson changed
the mood, as did Rep. James E. Rogan of California, who followed
him to spell out in exhaustive detail the Republicans' several
allegations of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson made a number of points that seemed telling, though
it was not possible to tell whether they had any impact on the
senators.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has made much of the fact that Ms. Lewinsky's
job search started well before it was known that she was on the
Jones witness list. But Hutchinson was able to show that the search
gained urgency only in the hours immediately after the president
learned on Dec. 10 that she was on the list. Before that, by
Jordan's own testimony, it had a low priority.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson also noted that her denial of a sexual relationship
in an affidavit Clinton suggested she make came before the judge in
the Jones case defined a sexual relationship. It should therefore
be construed as normal _ not legal _ language, Hutchinsion
suggested, and therefore a lie that the president encouraged.

EDITORIAL: STATEMENTS OF THE OBVIOUS  (DW) 

</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Jan. 15:
</P>
<P>
   The most striking thing about the House managers' recitation of
evidence against President Clinton was its redundancy. We know
Clinton lied with persistence. We know he coached others to cover
up for him. We know that he failed, through careful planning and
steady irresponsibility, in his constitutional duty to see that the
laws were faithfully enforced. We have long known, as Rep. James
Sensenbrenner pointed out in his opening statement, that William
Jefferson Clinton is a terrible example for youth, as well as for
adults involved in legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   What we did not hear was any new information or convincing
arguments that went to the core issue before the 100 senators
sitting as jurors. Is the scale of Clinton's offenses sufficient to
remove him from office and put the Republic through the trauma of
disrupting the electoral rhythm that has made the American
government a model of stability?
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors established in meticulous detail that
Clinton is a weak man. Their announced plan is to address
constitutional questions after reviewing the evidence. Even so,
they were unable to foreshadow a compelling reason for the Senate
to disrupt the quadrennial schedule for the transfer of
presidential power.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the House team acted as if it were the facts
that were mainly in dispute instead of the interpretation of the
constitutional standard of ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the White House lawyers seriously dispute the facts, and
that they do at Clinton's peril. In effectively presenting the
obstruction-of-justice case, Rep. Asa Hutchinson demonstrated that
Clinton's lawyers have to be careful about focusing on the facts
and arguing the law. That strategy backfired in the House and will
again in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   With regard to lying under oath, and particularly obstruction,
the facts are dangerous for Clinton. His defenders need to help the
Senate focus on the key question of the scale of the punishment
that Clinton has earned. To justify removal, the prosecutors have
to show some fundamental harm to the security interests or
stability of the state or some attempt to undermine the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   What they have recited so far is evidence demanding a firm but
lesser punishment appropriate to an elected official who has failed
in his duty and has probably violated federal statutes, but has not
done irreversible damage to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's presentations also produced no revelations that seem
to require the calling of witnesses for public testimony. The House
members' claim that the evidence is clear and well documented
undercuts their own argument that witnesses are necessary. The
prosecutors brought forth no questions that, if answered in a way
unfavorable to Clinton in live testimony, would tilt the balance
toward removal.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an important unanswered procedural question about
witnesses. The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, has failed so
far to appoint the four-member bipartisan panel that is supposed to
deal with the witness issue. Appointment of such a panel was part
of the agreement negotiated by Democrats and Republicans last week.
</P>
<P>
   Instead Lott has improperly authorized a few Republican senators
to meet secretly with the House prosecutors to discuss criteria for
witnesses. Those clandestine discussions should stop. A joint panel
is needed to stand up to the demand for witnesses to engage in the
pointless exercise of repeating what we already know.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday, the reciters of the evidentiary record will give
way to a trio of House members who are supposed to focus on the
constitutional case for removal. The three, Reps. Charles Canady,
Steve Buyer and Lindsey Graham, will have a hard time showing that
the facts described Thursday warrant defying the public will and
expanding the constitutional definition of high crimes and
misdemeanors.

WAKING UP `ANXIOUS' AS CLINTON TRIAL TAKES ON FORM 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _  &UR; Following are excerpts SEN. JON KYL'S personal
diary of the
 &UR; impeachment trial of President William Jefferson Clinton. He is
keeping the
 &UR; diary for his grandchildren. the excerpts will appear in ``THE
ARIZONA
 &UR; REPUBLIC'' throughout the trial.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONDAY, JAN. 11, 1999
</P>
<P>
   After reading the 400-plus page report of the House over the
weekend, I'm a bit more sympathetic to the House managers' request
to call witnesses. There are dozens of statements by numerous
witnesses that, taken together, comprise the House case. It's not
particularly easy to follow. House managers believe that witnesses
could ``pull it all together.'' (It's also possible that the
witnesses, who are primarily friends or associates of the
president, could derail the House case.)
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader (Trent) Lott has asked three of us to meet with
House managers to get an idea of how many witnesses they wish to
call, how long it will take, and to convey some sense of the
Senate's thinking in creating the procedure we approved to deal
with the witness issue. We also discuss how long they think it will
take to present their case in chief (on the House record). They
eventually conclude they could be done by 5 p.m. on Saturday if all
goes well. I'm glad we're going to utilize all day Saturday, even
though it sure shortens the weekend. &QL; 
TUESDAY, JAN. 12, 1999
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all day is consumed with various meetings discussing
aspects of the impeachment proceedings, including the intercession
of the State of the Union speech a week from tonight and the
Harkin-Wellstone motion to suspend the rules and conduct
deliberations in public.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republican senators are of two minds on that motion (which
would probably be debated and decided toward the end of next week,
when the first closed-session deliberation would occur on an
expected motion to dismiss by the president's lawyers).
</P>
<P>
   Decisions at most levels of government are made in public.
Public airing of issues enhances the credibility of the decisions.
And credibility of the impeachment proceedings is very important to
validate the final outcome, whatever it may be.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, that very concern about credibility can just as easily
lead to the opposite conclusion. Last Friday's closed bipartisan
conference confirmed the benefits of talking things out in private,
out of the glare of the TV cameras. Rather than playing to the TV
audience, hardening positions in the process, senators spoke calmly
and constructively. The bipartisan consensus that emerged enhanced
the credibility of the process. Sad to say, it would never have
happened if the meeting had been open to the press.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason jury deliberations have always been closed,
although impeachment is not precisely a jury trial. The impeachment
rules call for deliberations to be closed unless two-thirds of the
Senate votes to open them. It will be an interesting debate, and
most of the senators seem genuinely open-minded about the issue. &QL; 
WEDNESDAY, JAN. 13, 1999
</P>
<P>
   Virtually the entire day is spent in conferences discussing the
legislative agenda for the new Congress. The GOP conference agrees
on the priority bills we will introduce. And I have several
meetings with my staff going over bills I will introduce on the
first day, next Tuesday. &QL; 
THURSDAY, JAN. 14, 1999
</P>
<P>
   I woke up this morning very anxious. It's like the first day of
school, or a day for me to present a big case in court. While my
job is simply to sit, listen and reflect, I am anxious.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the most important days in our peacetime history;
it is important for everyone that by tonight, the American people
have confidence in the process. For the Senate, to maintain its
credibility. For the House, to acquit itself well. For the
president, to have a fair trial. And for the Constitution and the
people, to show that our system works.
</P>
<P>
   When I get to the office I'm distressed to see two inaccurate
news articles. The ``New York Times,'' in a long story on
supposedly ``secret'' meetings between senators and House managers,
says I've ``publicly called for witnesses'' in the case. I have
not, and my staff confirms that the ``Times'' agrees and will run a
correction tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``The Arizona Republic'' picked up the same
story, but will also correct it tomorrow. The ``secrecy''
implication is also false; Senator (Arlen) Specter invited both the
White House lawyers and Senate Democrats to participate in
meetings. (They declined.) I even referred to the meetings in my
diary.
</P>
<P>
   1 p.m. _ The trial starts with no fanfare. Henry Hyde and Jim
Sensenbrenner provide a helpful overview of the House case. Asa
Hutchinson, brother of Senator Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas,
discusses the evidence on the obstruction of justice charge,
concluding with what he calls ``The Seven Pillars of Obstruction.''
During a break, many of Tim's colleagues compliment him about the
fine job his brother did and kid him about the wrong Hutchinson
being in the Senate!
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rogan is the last presenter, discussing the evidence
supporting the perjury charge. His use of videotape was the first
ever on the Senate floor. I thought his presentation excruciatingly
thorough.
</P>
<P>
   During all of the presentation I was impressed by how intently
both Democrat and Republican senators listened.
</P>
<P>
   I think it would be inappropriate to comment on any of the
evidence presented, so I'll have to describe my reactions to
today's presentations after the case is over. But my general
reaction was that the process this day was serious, dignified, fair
and useful; and, therefore, my earlier anxieties about the
constitutional process have been allayed.
</P>
<P>
   As with last Friday (after the bipartisan agreement on
witnesses), at the end of this day I am satisfied with the progress
of the case; but, as then, I realize it is just the first day of
the trial, and there will be many twists and turns before the case
is over. &QL;

EDITORIAL: FRENCH MISCHIEF ON IRAQ  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Jan. 15:
</P>
<P>
   If the United Nations were to end sanctions against Iraqi oil
exports and let the proceeds flow through the hands of Saddam
Hussein, there is little doubt what would happen. He would use the
oil money to rebuild his arsenal of biological, chemical and
nuclear weapons and extended-range missiles. That is why France's
proposal to lift the oil embargo and move to a weakened system of
weapons monitoring and anemic safeguards against Iraqi weapons
purchases is unacceptable. Sanctions can safely be lifted only when
Iraq fully has complied with the disarmament requirements the
Security Council imposed after the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Before sanctions were imposed in 1990, Iraq used its oil
revenues to import the equipment and ingredients needed to make
large quantities of unconventional weapons. The tenacity with which
it has shielded its weapons programs from U.N. inspection leaves
little doubt that Baghdad means to rebuild them, and will resume
buying components abroad as soon as it can afford to.
</P>
<P>
   For now, sanctions are the only effective means to restrain
these weapons programs. No system of monitoring Iraqi purchases, as
the French propose, is reliable enough to prevent secret deals with
rogue arms merchants from Europe, Russia, China or America. Iraq
already has the technology and equipment for making germ weapons,
nerve gas and nuclear bombs. The ingredients needed for resuming
production are readily available in world markets.
</P>
<P>
   The most compelling argument made for ending sanctions is the
suffering of Iraq's people, who are innocent victims of a cruel
dictatorship. But it is a deceptive argument. Under the U. N.
program of oil for food and medicine, Iraq already is allowed to
sell $5.26 billion worth of oil every six months, about as much as
Baghdad can pump given today's low oil prices and Iraq's aging oil
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Washington now proposes allowing unlimited sales under this
program, which finances supervised purchases of food, medicine and
other basic consumer goods. If sanctions ended, there might be less
money for civilian needs rather than more, since Baghdad would
probably spend some of its oil income on presidential palaces,
security forces and covert weapons purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The French proposal includes monitoring of known Iraqi weapons
facilities by a less aggressive inspections agency than the one now
headed by Richard Butler. That is scarcely adequate. Because of
Iraqi obstruction over the years, many weapons research and
production sites remain unknown and would not be subjected to
monitoring. Only aggressive, surprise inspections can keep Iraq
from rapidly rebuilding its arsenal of terror.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the United States and Britain stand almost alone in
their insistence on effective measures to curb Iraqi weapons
programs. But that is enough. Both countries can veto any weakening
of Security Council resolutions on Iraq. They must stand ready to
do so.

EDITORIAL: A FOOTBALL DOME FOR THE CITY  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Jan. 15:
</P>
<P>
   For his startling State of the City speech Thursday, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani shed the formal podium, dropped his cumbersome
chart routine and laid out a long list of ideas _ some aimed at his
new national fan club, others an effort to cement his entry in New
York City history. At the top of this list is a grand plan for the
warehouse and storage area on Manhattan's West Side. Replacing
today's bleak landscape near the Jacob Javits Convention Center,
the mayor would build, as he put it, ``the most famous sports
facility in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   This facility would include a domed football stadium that would
fit in the area just south of the Javits Center. He suggested
moving Madison Square Garden to an area just east of the center.
Then the No. 7 subway line would be extended and rerouted south,
along existing rail lines, to add transportation that would serve
the Javits Center, the stadium and the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of details about this ambitious plan, skepticism
is in order. One question is whether this is a backdoor way of
slipping the Yankees out of the Bronx and into Manhattan, to a site
near the West Side Highway, which the mayor, incidentally, now
wants to name after Joe DiMaggio. While the mayor is said to want
to keep the Yankees in the Bronx, he wants to maintain the right to
negotiate to move them elsewhere rather than lose the team
altogether. But aides will not deny that this dome could keep the
rain off a baseball diamond just as easily as off a football field.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's Big Apple dome also raises a transportation issue.
More automobiles would aggravate problems with meeting federal
clean-air standards, reason enough to limit parking.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who proposed or re-proposed a total of six stadiums
Thursday, said the city would help build one for the Mets, one for
the Yankees, two minor-league stadiums in Staten Island and Coney
Island, plus the garden and domed stadium. How many of these
stadiums does the city really need, and at what cost in subsidies?
</P>
<P>
   As for Giuliani's other proposals, his plans to consolidate city
billing and health insurance for small businesses will sit well
with Republicans. A proposal for a ``new social program ... called
fatherhood'' and an effort to push for ``the Protestant work
ethic'' among welfare, workfare and foster parents will also shore
up his GOP credentials.
</P>
<P>
   The partisan rhetoric, however, was tempered with an effort by
the mayor to show his better, less abrasive side. He softened his
views on methadone, agreeing for the first time that some addicts
will continue to need this chemical crutch to stay off heroin. He
also shared some of the credit for the city's successes with his
staff and the City Council, a generosity that, on a normal day,
would have made headlines by itself.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's big splash, however, was the bubble dome, which he
said could be used to attract a football team, maybe even the Jets.
It made for a dramatic ending to his annual speech. The question
now is whether it would be a reasonable addition to the city.

HAITIAN LEADER'S FOES RAISE SPECTER OF DICTATORSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ The streets of this impoverished capital
buzzed with the normal hubbub of life Thursday, but inside the
corridors of power opposition leaders were accusing the president
of trying to establish a virtual dictatorship. The president
insisted he was trying to build a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there has been little outcry here over President Rene
Preval's decision on Monday to bypass the Parliament and form a
government by decree. The only objections have come from some
businessmen and opposition politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Preval's choice for prime minister, Jacques-Edouard Alexis,
promised to form a government and hold parliamentary elections as
soon as possible. But some Haitians said they feared they were
witnessing the unraveling of the country's fragile democracy, this
time not through a military coup but through the political
maneuvering of Preval and his mentor, the former president,
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president should sit down and talk with these
parliamentarians so that this thing will not explode,'' said a
clerk in a downtown business, echoing the views of many and
insisting on anonymity. ``What's happening now is not good for
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The disagreements have paralyzed the government since June 1997,
when Prime Minister Rosny Smarth resigned to protest the elections
held that April.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, parliamentary leaders have rejected three of
Preval's nominees for prime minister. The fourth, Alexis, a former
education minister, was approved last year by both houses, but was
required to present his program and Cabinet for approval before
being sworn in. Opposition leaders threatened to reject him unless
they were given key Cabinet positions.
</P>
<P>
   As the end of the year approached, the legislators passed a law
extending their terms after they failed to reach an agreement with
the president on the makeup of an election committee and an
election date.
</P>
<P>
   But Preval scotched that plan on Monday. Saying he was upholding
the constitution, he announced he did not have the authority to
extend the lawmakers' terms. He also said Alexis had already been
approved and could form a government even though a new Parliament
had yet to be elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to build something called democracy,'' Preval
said. ``Democracy, above all, is the respect for the rules of the
game. We can't every time a problem arises change the rules of the
game in order to solve the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, however, Preval's move dashed the
opposition's hope that it would control some important Cabinet
positions. It also meant that the political faction supporting
Preval and Aristide will put together the committee to oversee the
next elections without influence from other groups.
</P>
<P>
   Political opponents of Preval have accused him of what amounts
to a bloodless coup, saying he eliminated the legislature's
influence with a stroke of the pen. ``Preval has staged a coup
d'etat to establish a dictatorship,'' Myrlande Manigat, a
constitutional law expert, told The Associated Press. ``There are
many kinds of coups _ not only military.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have charged that Preval is laying the groundwork for
Aristide to run for President in 2001, hoping to control the
electoral committee and thus weaken the chance that factions
opposed to Aristide might gain a parliamentary majority. They say
Preval delayed holding elections in order to bypass the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But government officials insist Preval is only trying to break a
political deadlock that has driven the country deeper into poverty.
Despite four years of democracy, Haiti remains the poorest country
in the Western Hemisphere. The country has not had a budget for two
years. Millions of dollars in foreign aid have been placed on
indefinite hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a general feeling among the people that this
Parliament has been responsible for the gridlock as opposed to
seeing to the well-being of the country,'' the foreign minister,
Fritz Longchamp, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have serious problems in Haiti, economic and social,'' he
added. ``The only way we can solve these problems is to have a
government that has a majority in Parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   Longchamp rejected suggestions that the president was trying to
form a strongman government. ``Is he trying to become a dictator by
observing the law?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and officials here said the root of the current crisis
was a simple power struggle between two wings of what was once
Aristide's Lavalas movement: oneled by Aristide, called the Lavalas
Family, and the other, the Organization of the People in Struggle,
which dominates the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition fears that if Aristide is returned to power,
Haiti will become a dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Preval's maneuvering appears to have paid off.
Few people among Haiti's downtrodden lower classes, the bulk of
Aristide's supporters, are springing to Parliament's defense. The
Parliament has angered some people by passing an austere economic
program backed by international lenders that calls for about 5,000
state employees to be laid off.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Preval can count on the loyalty of the 6,000-member
police force that replaced the army when Aristide abolished the
military in 1994. Some top commanders are Aristide supporters and
Alexis, as prime minister, will preside over the National Police
Commission that controls the force.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of the neutrality of the new police force that
there has been no reprisal for the shooting on Tuesday of Preval's
sister, Marie-Claude Calvin, who was wounded when gunmen attacked
her car.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is following the theory that the attack was
politically motivated, perhaps by people hoping to stir up violence
in the wake of Preval's announcement. Under past right-wing
governments, retribution killings would have been automatic,
officials said.

AS POST-JORDAN ERA DAWNS, A BULL MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The No. 1 commodity took himself out of the bidding on
Wednesday, and for the first time in more than a decade, the
six-time National Basketball Association champion Chicago Bulls
find themselves hoping to rebuild rather than preparing to reload.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan's retirement set off not only a domino effect
within his own franchise but also changed the face of free-agent
negotiations throughout the NBA. With eight Chicago players no
longer wed to the organization by virtue of Jordan, a Bull market
is taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen has not ruled out re-signing with the Bulls, but
continuing discussions between Jimmy Sexton, Pippen's agent, and
the Houston Rockets seemed to indicate that the All-Star forward
may be within days of joining Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley
on a Hall of Fame, if aging, front line.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Bulls cannot renounce rights to any of their players
until the lockout is lifted _ the league is hoping to open training
camps and allow teams to trade and sign players Tuesday _ Pippen
may also be part of a package in which he is signed and then traded
by Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   If they are able to re-sign Pippen, the Bulls are expected to
make a strong bid for Jayson Williams, the New Jersey Nets'
free-agent center who is the league's second-best rebounder behind
Rodman. Though Williams' departure from the Nets is highly
unlikely, his agent, Sal DiFazio, was displeased with the initial
offer the Nets made Wednesday and has not ruled out a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still in negotiations with the Nets, but I'm also in
negotiations with several teams,'' said DiFazio, who declined to
name the teams.
</P>
<P>
   While not championship caliber, a lineup that included Pippen,
Toni Kukoc and Williams would certainly make the Bulls a threat in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers, who would most likely send Elden
Campbell and Eddie Jones to the Bulls for Pippen, have been
mentioned, as has the Orlando Magic, which might be willing to part
with Anfernee Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Pippen, the futures of Dennis Rodman, Luc Longley, Jud
Buechler, Steve Kerr, Scott Burrell, Bill Wennington, Dickey
Simpkins and Joe Kleine are much more unsettled than they would
have been if Jordan had decided to play at least one more season.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls general manager Jerry Krause has openly discussed the
possibility of refurbishing the franchise.

 &HT;    Sugar growers, officials ask for 4 more years to clean up
Everglades
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As they have been doing since 1995, sugar growers and
state officials asked a federal judge Thursday to give them four
more years to clean up the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups want U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler
to maintain the July 2002 deadline for the $763 million cleanup.
They say further delay will harm the Everglades. But state
officials and the sugar industry want to delay it to December 2006,
the deadline that the Florida legislature and the federal
government agreed to in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state is moving heaven and earth to comply with the
Everglades Forever Act,'' said Chip Collette, a lawyer for the
state Department of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeveler has never acted on the state's request to extend the
deadlines, and he made no ruling Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was the latest step in a lawsuit that the federal
government filed in 1988 against the state and the South Florida
Water Management District, accusing them of letting farm runoff
pollute the Everglades. The 2002 deadline was part of a 1991
settlement that never took effect.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar growers want the case dismissed. Their attorneys said
Thursday that the state's cleanup project and the industry's
efforts are already showing reduced levels of phosphorus, a soil
and fertilizer ingredient that is choking the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Everglades is light years ahead of where we thought it
would be at the time of the settlement,'' said sugar industry
lawyer William Green.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter Lehtinen, attorney for the Miccosukee Indian tribe, was
the acting U.S. attorney when he filed the federal suit in 1988. He
wants Hoeveler to appoint a special master to oversee the cleanup.
So do environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Miccosukee tribe also called on Hoeveler to bring the
``western basins,'' a large area not currently covered by the
cleanup, into the plan. The tribe argues that the settlement called
for including other watersheds. Lawyers for the state said the
settlement doesn't set any deadlines for that.
</P>
<P>
   The Miccosukees also argue that water managers' plans to put
partially treated water, still containing phosphorus, into parched
sections of the Everglades is a cure worse than the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Jones, a Florida International University biologist and
consultant to both the Miccosukees and the federal government,
showed photos of one patch of ground that became covered in algae
two months after partially treated water was sent over it.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeveler will hear arguments again today and tour the Everglades
before ruling.

BOTHA HAS HAD HIS MOMENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Francois Botha: sacrificial lamb or legitimate
opponent?
</P>
<P>
   The casual fan might believe the former is the case, that Botha,
a chubby South African with a mediocre resume, was handpicked to
kickstart Tyson's second return to boxing.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes with him and the memory of his bout with Michael
Moorer, however, create just an iota of doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public still sees (Tyson) as the baddest man out there,''
said Botha, 30. ``They know his history. That's why they think
they'll never see Francois alive again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who come to see me train, the people who know me
know I can beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   Botha is 39-1, with one no-contest and 24 knockouts. Yes, all
but two of his opponents _ Axel Schulz and Michael Moorer _ were
relative unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   However, he has had his moments.
</P>
<P>
   He outpointed Schulz to win the vacant IBF championship in 1995
only to lose it when he tested positive for steroids. The bout was
declared a no-contest.
</P>
<P>
   His next fight was against Moorer, who had beaten Schulz for the
vacant title. Botha took a beating from a superior fighter, losing
a 12th-round TKO, but showed solid skills and a fighting spirit
that leads one to believe he won't back down against Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got nothing to lose and everything to gain,'' he said.
``If I lose, everyone will say I told you so.... Just imagine after
I beat Mike Tyson what they'll say.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Weighty matters:!off! The most exciting thing at the
weigh-in Thursday was an appearance by Muhammad Ali, who will be
honored by the MGM Grand on his birthday. Otherwise, it was
business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson weighed in at 223 pounds, one more than he weighed in the
first Holyfield bout and the most in his career. He looked as fit
as ever, though. Botha weighed 233, nine more than in his bout with
Moorer.
</P>
<P>
   Botha, who is a good four inches taller than Tyson, was
encouraged after the two _ both shirtless _ stared one another
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel even better after seeing him like that,'' he said.
``... He's not as big as you think he is.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Money galore:!off! Even if Botha loses, he'll make out
OK: His portion of the purse is a career-high $1.85 million. Tyson
is guaranteed $10 million but is expected to walk away with around
$17 million when his share of pay-per-view revenues roll in. &UR; !end! &QL;

AN UNDERACHIEVER, GOLDBERG MOSER O'NEILL, GOES FOR THE BUZZ 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct byline.)  
 (ATTN: Calif., Wash.)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leading San Francisco agency, Goldberg Moser O'Neill, is
reorganizing to gain a higher profile among advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg Moser, partly owned by the Interpublic Group of
Companies, was founded in 1990 as a spinoff of the San Francisco
office of Chiat/Day, now the TBWA/Chiat/Day unit of Omnicom Group.
Billings have grown from an estimated $58 million then to an
estimated $450 million now from clients like Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton,
Cisco Systems Corp., Coca-Cola Co., Dell Computer Corp., Dreyer's
Grand Ice Cream and the Kia Motors America unit of Hyundai Group.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Goldberg Moser has landed two plum accounts: Lucas
Arts Entertainment Co. in San Rafael, Calif., a software developer
and publisher owned by the film director George Lucas, with
billings estimated at $15 million to $20 million, and Soma Corp. in
Seattle, the operator of an Internet pharmacy site on the World
Wide Web, www.soma.com, with billings estimated at $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a perception that Goldberg Moser has been an
underachiever in the intensely competitive San Francisco and West
Coast advertising markets. Several agencies generally acknowledged
as among America's leading creative shops are neighbors, including
Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners, owned by Omnicom, and Publicis &AMP;
Hal Riney, part of Publicis SA.
</P>
<P>
   Goodby, Silverstein was recently chosen by Dreyer's to handle a
so-called superpremium ice cream brand, though Goldberg Moser
continues handling the Dreyer's and Edy's brands.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg Moser also faces challenges from big agencies that have
or will have full-service offices in San Francisco: the BBDO
Worldwide and DDB Needham Worldwide units of Omnicom and Lowe &AMP;
Partners/SMS, part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic. There are
feisty smaller shops, too, like Butler, Shine &AMP; Stern in nearby
Sausalito, Calif., and the San Francisco office of the British
agency Leagas Delaney.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done better creatively in the last three or four years
and we're extremely profitable,'' said Fred Goldberg, chairman and
chief executive at Goldberg Moser. ``Yet we're not getting the
recognition we think we deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason? ``The work we're doing is not at the level we want
it to be across the board,'' said Goldberg, 57. ``So we've decided
to shake the whole thing up.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of that shake-up is a reorganization involving the
account planning department. Account planners are responsible for
gathering insights from consumers on their opinions about brands
and products, then sharing that information with the creative
department to help produce more effective campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg Moser is renaming account planning as brand planning,
with the brand planning directors paired with creative directors to
form brand-planning teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big opportunity here to figure out how to marry them
together in more meaningful ways,'' said Mike Moser, 45, executive
vice president and account planning director, who becomes executive
vice president in charge of brand management. He will work with
Catrina McAuliffe, senior vice president and chief marketing
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to focus planning back on being much more of a
creative tool instead of an account management tool,'' said Ms.
McAuliffe, 42.
</P>
<P>
   The analytical aspects of the planning directors' jobs are being
shifted to an accountability group. Katheryn Silverthorn, 54,
becomes associate director for accountability; she had most
recently worked at G2 in Huntington Beach, Calif., a unit of Grey
Advertising that closed.
</P>
<P>
   Other executives named to new posts include Nancy Hill, 40, vice
president and business development director, who has worked at
agencies including the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of
TBWA/Chiat/Day, and Brian O'Neill, 46, who has been promoted to
president and chief creative officer from executive vice president
and creative director.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a bit of a pull between wanting to be a creative
agency,'' O'Neill said, ``and wanting to be a responsible agency
making sure the work works.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to create a buzz for the agency so that we'll be
mentioned in the same breath as a Goodby, a Chiat/Day, a Fallon
McElligott, a Wieden &AMP; Kennedy,'' he added, ``which helps to
energize how your clients feel about the work you're doing for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to hire people when you have that buzz,'' O'Neill
said, adding that Goldberg Moser plans to expand the creative
department. A third associate creative director has joined the
agency: Rob Bagot, 35, a former senior copywriter at Goodby,
Silverstein who most recently had been chairman and creative
director at the Seattle office of a creative boutique, Big Bang
Idea Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   One long-term goal for the reorganization, Goldberg said, is to
more than double billings, to $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's unrealistic that we could reach that in
three years,'' he said, adding, ``But if we don't, that would be
OK, as long as we achieve getting our recognition up at a much
higher level than it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   To be continued in January 2002.

GIULIANI OFFERS PLAN FOR NEW SPORTS COMPLEX
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani backed away Thursday from his
support for moving Yankee Stadium to the West Side of Manhattan and
instead proposed an even more ambitious plan for the same site: a
sports complex that would include a domed football stadium intended
for the New York Jets, a relocated Madison Square Garden and a
subway line to provide easier access to the athletics mecca.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the threat that the New York Yankees might leave the
Bronx for New Jersey, Giuliani offered a plan last year to combine
private financing with tax money to build a new stadium on a rail
yard near 11th Avenue and West 33rd Street. Although the mayor
emphasized that it was just one option, the plan was widely
criticized as exorbitant and disruptive, and Giuliani and his aides
referred to it less and less frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Thursday afternoon, Giuliani delivered a State of the City
address that was saved from predictability by his surprise proposal
for the same Manhattan location. Saying that he was going to
assume, for now, that the Yankees would remain in the Bronx, a
visibly excited Giuliani unveiled a bird's-eye layout of his plan
to acquire a football team.
</P>
<P>
   His aides emphasized that this latest plan was a broader, more
ambitious concept to create what Giuliani called ``the most famous
sports facility in the world.'' The project would be built on land
owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The stadium and
Madison Square Garden would be linked to the Javits Convention
Center, forming a triangular destination that would attract
conventions, concerts and sporting events, like the college
basketball championship games, to an underused section of the city,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration refused to rule out the possibility that the
stadium could also someday be used for baseball _ say, by the
Yankees. ``The mayor's long-stated preference is keeping the
Yankees in the Bronx,'' said Colleen Roche, his press secretary.
``It's his business as mayor to make sure that they stay in the
city, and he will do whatever he has to to accomplish that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from the Yankees to the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Giuliani's aides said the new plan was more
manageable than the proposal for a baseball stadium, which critics
said would create traffic gridlock on the West Side on at least 81
days a year, the usual number of baseball home games. Professional
football teams, meanwhile, play 10 home games during the preseason
and regular season, usually on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   And Giuliani made it clear that he was targeting the Jets, who
play Denver on Sunday for the right to go to the Super Bowl, to be
the home team. ``And you know what football team I'm thinking
about, right?'' he said. ``The Super Bowl champs.''
</P>
<P>
   No information was available about the cost or financing of the
project, although a 1996 study placed a $1.1 billion price tag on a
combined baseball-football stadium at the same location. Nor were
there any data about the timing, the construction, the parking or
even the intentions of the Jets, whose lease with the New Jersey
Sports and Exposition Authority at Giants Stadium in the
Meadowlands ends in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether city officials had met with the football
team's owners, Ms. Roche said, ``That's not something that the
mayor wants to comment on.''

BIOMED GIANT ALFRED MANN AT IT AGAIN WITH IPO PLAN FOR ADVANCED
BIONICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- IPO watchers take note: Alfred Mann, godfather of
Los Angeles biomedicine, is about to take another company public.
</P>
<P>
   At a biotechnology conference this week in San Francisco,
officials with Mann's Advanced Bionics discussed the company with
analysts and investors. The company now expects to have an initial
public offering later this year, a spokesman told the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the IPO is expected to be strong. Unlike recent IPOs
for Internet-based companies, Advanced Bionics has strong sales and
sells an actual product, not just a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Bionics, based in suburban Sylmar and spun off from
Mann's highly successful MiniMed Inc. in 1993, is the nation's only
maker of cochlear implants. The $10,000 devices, also known as
bionic ears, let a high percentage of profoundly deaf children and
adults hear by electrically stimulating nerve cells in the inner
ear.
</P>
<P>
   Both the implant and procedure, which costs another $30,000 or
so, are covered by Medicare and by most private health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the hearing business, which the company said is
growing at 40 percent annually with anticipated 1999 sales of $36
million, officials with Advanced Bionics said it is the company
best poised to profit from the growing field of neurostimulation.
Using the same technology platform created for the ear implant,
they expect to market in coming years products for treating chronic
pain, incontinence and ultimately ailments as severe as blindness
and paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to have a public offering to raise capital and funds
to further the extensive research we're doing in these other
areas,'' said company spokesman Doug Lynch. Lynch, who is himself
deaf, was an early recipient of an Advanced Bionics ear implant.
</P>
<P>
   Given Mann's financial success at MiniMed, analysts say an
Advanced Bionics IPO would likely find eager investors. MiniMed
dominates the market for insulin infusion pumps, which diabetics --
including the current Miss America -- wear to deliver the
sugar-regulating hormone to their bodies on an as-needed basis.
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed's sales have more than doubled in three years, from $45
million in fiscal 1995 to $99.5 million last year. The company's
share price has likewise climbed, from about $35 a share a year ago
to a Thursday close of $94.0625.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on Al Mann's track record and ability to make money for
himself and shareholders, the American investing public is going to
be interested in anything he's involved with,'' said analyst
Phillip Nalbone at Volpe Brown Whelan in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it is still too early to say how much money
will be raised or when precisely an IPO would occur. And as with
nearly all IPOs, individual investors hoping to get in on the
ground floor may find themselves locked out.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the only individuals who can buy into an IPO before
it is available to the general public are the best customers of the
brokerages that are handling the IPO and employees of the company
going public.
</P>
<P>
   If the recent Internet IPOs are any guide, shares of an IPO can
double or triple between the time a company offers them to the
brokerages and when those shares actually begin trading on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said he did not know even at this point which firm will
underwrite the deal.
</P>
<P>
   While Advanced Bionics faces some competition in the cochlear
implant market from an Australian company, Cochlear Ltd., it is in
the midst of an ambitious expansion campaign that has seen it open
offices in Europe, South America, Canada and the Middle East in the
past two years. And by most technical standards, its implant is
more advanced than anything else on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mann has said we will make the deaf hear, the blind see and
the lame walk,'' Lynch said. ``Coming from almost any other person,
that might seem too lofty a goal, but he's a man who will make that
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, Mann donated $100 million each to the
University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of
Southern California so they could create bioengineering research
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades ago, Mann founded Pacesetters Inc., one of the
most successful heart pacemaker manufacturers, which he later sold
to a Minnesota-based medical devices manufacturer.

STOPPING THE DOWNWARD CYCLE IN BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also BRAZIL-ECON, BRAZIL-ARGENTINA) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senior Clinton administration officials and the
International Monetary Fund warned Brazil's president, Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, on Thursday that his government was unlikely to
hold the devaluation of its currency to 8 percent, and might waste
billions of dollars of its precious foreign currency reserves
attempting to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The warning came as the Brazilian stock market fell 10 percent
before it was shut down, and as currency speculators forced Brazil
to spend more than $1 billion _ for the third day running _ in an
attempt to keep its currency, the real, from falling further.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said they were in constant communication
Thursday with officials in other countries in the region,
particularly Argentina and Mexico, in an effort to keep Brazil's
action from touching off panics that many fear could drag down
other Latin American nations.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday those concerns deepened on Wall Street. The Dow
Jones industrial average fell 228.63 points, or 2.45 percent,
partly because of fears that Brazil's problems could spread,
hurting both American exports and the earnings of banks that, while
less exposed to Latin America than they were a few months ago,
found themselves on the wrong side of a bet about Brazil's
prospects of recovery. The deputy treasury secretary, Lawrence
Summers, a key strategist in the Clinton administration's efforts
to contain the global financial turmoil, postponed a long-scheduled
trip to Asia next week.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials in both countries who had been briefed
about the high-level telephone conversations between Washington and
Brasilia, it was unclear what Cardoso would do next. But as one
official involved in the talks said, ``Cardoso was told that the
likelihood his current strategy will work is very low.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso now finds himself caught between two extraordinarily
difficult political choices.
</P>
<P>
   He could continue to fight off the speculators who are selling
reals, spending billions of dollars from his country's reserves to
buy his own country's currency. That would deplete reserves
estimated at about $32 billion, a figure that would soon fall to
zero if money kept flowing out of Brazil at current rates. Some
Brazilian officials, however, are still hoping that they can regain
the confidence of investors, convincing them that Cardoso still has
the power to push through painful economic reforms that have
touched off enormous political opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, Brazil could take the route that the IMF has
suggested: Abandon the ``exchange rate band'' that artificially
keeps the real from rising or falling past predetermined limits,
and let the currency find its own value in the foreign exchange
market. The IMF did not propose simply letting the currency spiral
into an uncontrolled fall. Instead, it urged the Brazilians to
temporarily raise interest rates _ which are already above 50
percent _ as an incentive for investors to keep money in Brazil.
The IMF officials told Brazil that in South Korea last year that
strategy eventually arrested the fall of the Korean won.
</P>
<P>
   But that could mean the currency would fall 20 percent or more,
touching off inflation and a decline in the living standard of
Brazil's middle class. Cardoso has staked his political career _ he
just won re-election _ by stabilizing the economy after years of
hyper-inflation, and is loath to see his legacy lost.
</P>
<P>
   American officials, who say they were presented with Brazil's
decision this week as a fait accompli, insist that they have
avoided prescribing a next move to the Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not characterize the content of our discussions with
Brazil and the IMF,'' said Howard Schloss, spokesman for Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin. ``Other than to say that we have not
outlined a detailed set of policy prescriptions to the Brazilians,
including exchange rate regimes.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Cardoso spoke at length on Wednesday with
Rubin, and on Thursday with the first deputy managing director of
the IMF, Stanley Fischer. The blunter-speaking Summers has
conducted a series of talks with his Brazilian counterpart, Pedro
Malan.
</P>
<P>
   Those conversations take place in the strictest secrecy, and the
accounts of them that leak out later are often shaded to fit the
self-interest of the leaker.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian officials, for example, have argued repeatedly in
recent days that the devaluation was not their fault, but was
forced upon them by currency speculators seeking to exploit delays
in the adoption of the reform program. American and IMF officials
blame the Brazilians for taking too long to execute their
commitments, undermining investors' confidence that Cardoso has the
power to ultimately get them through.
</P>
<P>
   They may both be right. But the events of the last few days also
exposed some enormous cracks in the approach taken to keep the
Asian economic crisis from washing onto American shores.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil assumed that the $41.5 billion package, which included a
$5 billion commitment by the United States, would give it plenty of
breathing room. Only a few months ago, officials expressed
confidence that speculators would fear attacking the Brazilian
currency as long as they knew the United States and the IMF stood
behind Brazil's reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Clinton administration bet that Cardoso, fresh
from an election victory, had the power to fulfill his promises.
That, too, proved a bad bet _ one reminiscent of the American and
IMF roll of the dice last summer in Russia. That bailout, suspended
after $4.8 billion was sent to Moscow, was based on the assumption
that President Boris Yeltsin would convince the Russian Parliament
to pass extensive economic reforms. Cardoso delivered more in
Brazil than Yeltsin delivered in Moscow. But neither did enough to
convince the markets.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's decision on Wednesday to attempt a limited devaluation
was an effort to mollify those markets _ bait thrown to the sharks
to take them off course. The idea was to give something to
investors who have long feared the real is overvalued. But
investors concluded that any government willing to devalue once
would devalue again. So they took even more money out of the
country. And that, in turn, raises the chances that Brazil will
have to devalue again. It is a downward cycle that once started is
hard to stop.

`INTERIOR DECORATOR' BURGLAR IN CUSTODY, L.A. POLICE SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- After breaking into homes, this burglar doesn't
just steal: First he helps himself to clean clothes, fixes dinner,
sits by the fireplace and maybe even takes a bubble bath.
</P>
<P>
   Even more incredible, police said Thursday, is that he likes to
rearrange the furniture before fleeing with jewelry and cash, thus
their nickname for him: ``The Interior Decorator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Goldilocks and the Three Bears,'' said Los Angeles
police Detective Jose Suarez of the North Hollywood Division.
``It's not like the stereotypical burglar. For some reason, this
guy sticks around until someone gets home. Most burglars don't make
themselves at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was identified as Ataya Rsaya, a 31-year-old man
arrested on suspicion of one count of burglary in North Hollywood,
police said. He is wanted on burglary charges in San Francisco and
similar arrests in five other states.
</P>
<P>
   Rsaya was arrested Sunday a block away from a North Hollywood
town house where police said he had spent the night in bed. As is
often the case, the burglar hung around until the owner returned
home, about 3 p.m. He fled and was captured, police said.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco police Inspector Gary Jimenez said Rsaya told him
he had emigrated from Africa to America and believes he is helping
people who have too much money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says that the educated and rich people have nice things.
They should share. And he's providing that service to them,''
Jimenez said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured in any of the burglaries, although the thief
got away with a gun from one home, police said.
</P>
<P>
   One victim, Mark Basler, is not rich, but the burglar decided to
break into his comfortable town house in North Hollywood on
Saturday. Basler caught the wanderer Sunday afternoon escaping out
the rear sliding glass window and onto his second-floor balcony.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy was just hanging out here, chilling, eating,'' said
Basler.
</P>
<P>
   After the thief jumped to the first-floor balcony, Basler called
911 and police swiftly caught the burglar a block away. He later
positively identified the intruder, who was dressed in Basler's
pants, his $80 work shoes and a jacket from a movie set Basler had
worked on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's looking good,'' said Basler, who works as a transporter
on movie sets, hauling equipment. ``It's all color-coordinated. I
said: `Look, man, you can keep the pants. They look very good on
you. But I want the jacket and shoes back.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Basler can joke about it now, but the burglar had also stolen
jewelry from Basler's roommate, Emmett Grennan.
</P>
<P>
   When Basler returned home, he and Grennan found the burglar had
exchanged his clothing for theirs -- and put it away neatly. ``The
underwear, socks, everything was in the correct drawer,'' Basler
said.
</P>
<P>
   The burglar also likes to rearrange household items, as if he
lives there.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Basler's $300 shoes were taken from the closet and
placed on the bookshelf. A small statue by the fireplace had been
placed elsewhere. A bedroom alarm clock was brought downstairs. And
cigarette ash-filled coasters were in three rooms, Basler said.
</P>
<P>
   A can of tuna, half eaten by the man, sat in the living room.
And oddly enough, the burglar left eight mug-shot photos of himself
on Basler's computer desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything had the stench of him,'' Basler said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives say they can't quite figure the burglar out. He knows
how to pick locks and then lounges in people's homes -- not minding
being caught. Police are not even sure if he has given them his
real name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't know if the guy's crazy,'' Suarez said. ``It's
like he's setting up housekeeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Rsaya was being held at a downtown Los Angeles jail in lieu of
$1 million bail, Jimenez said. The amount is so high because of his
multiple offenses and because this is at least the second time he
has been arrested on suspicion of burglary since he was released on
his own recognizance, police said.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 27, Rsaya was arrested in San Francisco, but a judge
released him on his own recognizance. The high-class burglar bought
a Greyhound bus ticket to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, he is accused of robbing at least six homes,
mostly in the pricey Telegraph Hill area, including one home that
he targeted twice, Jimenez said. Rsaya has been charged with four
burglaries, in addition to one trespassing charge there.
</P>
<P>
   In one home, he assembled one person's new stereo that was
sitting in a box. ``He wanted the music,'' Jimenez said.
</P>
<P>
   Rsaya also blackened a tenant's walls while burning the
fireplace with the damper closed as he sipped wine.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's brother walked in to check up on his place, and the
thief sternly told him, ``I'm living here,'' Jimenez said. ``He
told him, `No, you don't live here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Rsaya is said to angering police officers, and has even
forced one family from their upscale San Francisco home of three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They felt that he may be a danger,'' Jimenez said. ``Quite a
few rich people were getting upset.''

AFTER OPENING PRESENTATIONS, SENATORS MAINTAIN PARTY-LINE STANCES
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Tenn., Okla., N.D., Iowa, N.J., Alaska, N.Y., Ill.)  (bl) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many senators emerged from the chamber Thursday
evening flush with praise for House prosecutors in the impeachment
trial of President Clinton, but it was clear that the presentations
on the floor had done little to alter their party-line stances.
</P>
<P>
   Taking to the microphones in the Capitol, Republicans said the
opening presentations were tantalizing enough to justify calling
witnesses who might clear up the unanswered questions laid out by
the House managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good case was begun that when you have conflicting evidence,
for us to make an impartial decision may well require witnesses,
whose demeanor we can judge, who can be cross-examined for the
first time,'' said Sen. William Frist, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the majority whip, even suggested
Thursday night that Clinton might be a possible witness, a prospect
that House prosecutors pressed Thursday. ``I think he should be
invited, or at least I don't have a problem with him being
invited,'' Nickles said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, though, insisted that they had heard nothing new or
incendiary enough to convict Clinton or to legitimize summoning key
players, including the president, to the Senate, at least in the
opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear anything new,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
``I don't think there is anything today that the Senate doesn't
know or hasn't heard or, in fact, most of the country hasn't
heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were, in fact, limited in their opening presentation
to the record established in the House. But Senate Democrats still
complained that the managers spent all day trying to persuade
senators they would need to hear from witnesses to get to the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, they say they have enough on the record to
remove the president from office,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa,
who had already called the House's case ``dung'' on national
television. ``On the other hand, they say they need witnesses to
make their case. You can't have it both ways. They either have the
evidence or they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkin added, ``The first six hours was spent on trying to make
the case to bring Monica Lewinsky and possibly the president of the
United States before the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said he noticed that most of
Thursday's argument was built around Clinton's deposition in the
Paula Jones case, one of two articles of perjury the House rejected
in December.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, concurred with Democrats on one level. ``There's nothing
I hadn't read before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the senator said the presentation served to tie the
disparate pieces together in a meaningful way. ``These guys have
brought the evidence together in a time sequence and a relevancy
approach that eliminates a lot of cobwebs in this case for me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens also added his voice to the growing chorus of
Republicans who want to hear from the central players in the case _
including Monica Lewinsky and Betty Currie _ saying they could
expound on the obstruction of justice charge. ``I think today
changed my mind on calling some of those witnesses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were not quick to embrace that idea. The very idea of
Ms. Lewinsky standing in the well of the Senate, said Sen. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., ``is something I shudder at.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said the prosecutors laid out a
``chronology'' that helped bring it all together in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   In Harkin's view, that same chronology was more like ``trying to
follow the bouncing ball'' only the ``ball wasn't going to land
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., who made perhaps the
only comment that no one, Republican or Democrat, could take issue
with. ``Those chairs are more museum pieces, and I don't think they
had sitting in mind when they designed them,'' Fitzgerald said,
after spending close to six hours in his chair. ``They push you
down, and the desks, of course, are too high to write on. They're
uncomfortable.''

US PROBING HARVARD-SPONSORED PROGRAM  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors are conducting a criminal and civil
investigation into whether officials of a Harvard
University-sponsored effort to help Russia reconstruct its economy
profited from inside market knowledge, according to Harvard and US
government sources.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Harvard convenes top US and Russian business and
political leaders Friday for a two-day symposium on Russia's
economy and investments, the university is in the awkward position
of answering questions from federal investigators about the Harvard
Institute for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   The office of US Attorney Donald K. Stern is conducting the
investigation of the institute officials, who were operating under
a US government grant while they were helping Russia adapt to
capitalism. Both Harvard and US government sources in Washington
confirmed the existence of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, institute officials who played a key role in Russia's
economic reconstruction, including a distinguished Harvard
economist, were not even invited to speak at a conference that will
discuss Russian investment opportunties and mull over the fruits of
their work.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources familiar with the probe, the investigators
are trying to determine if the principals _ renowned Harvard
economics Professor Andrei Shleifer and Jonathan Hay _ violated
federal law during the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the sources said, the investigators are focusing
on whether Shleifer and Hay profited from investments made by
Shleifer's wife and Hay's girlfriend into Russia's stock market
while the institute was being paid $43 million by the US government
to advise Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his economic chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Graham Allison, director of the center at the John F. Kennedy
School of Government at Harvard, which is sponsoring the symposium,
said that considering the institute's major involvement in
transforming the Russian economy, it was reasonable to ask why
neither Shleifer nor anyone else from the institute was
participating as a moderator or panel member.
</P>
<P>
   But, Allison insisted, the reason had nothing to do with the
negative publicity that ensued from disclosures over the alleged
conflicts of interest involving Shleifer and Hay.
</P>
<P>
   Although Shleifer and Jeffrey Sachs, director of the institute,
were among about 20 Harvard professors with expertise in Russia
invited to attend the symposium, he said neither man has been
invited to speak or moderate because the sessions are focusing on
current investment opportunities and challenges.
</P>
<P>
   However, another Russian scholar at Harvard said that while
Shleifer's reputation remains intact at Harvard, his appearance as
a moderator or panel member would have raised eyebrows because of
the controversy. ``He's hot merchandise right now,'' said the
Harvard professor, who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs, who was unaware of the alleged profiteering, has not been
implicated in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators working on the case, including assistant US
Attorney Sarah M. Bloom, have spoken frequently in recent months
with lawyers and other officials at Harvard University and have
sought volumes of documents from the Harvard Institute for
International Development about its work with the Russian
government. The institute's rules specifically prohibit its
employees or members of their families from investing in the
country they are advising.
</P>
<P>
   Stern refused to discuss the investigation Thursday. But its
priority was underscored by a Justice Department letter last June
asking the chairman of the House Committee on International
Relations to defer a congressional review of the institute's
activity. Such a review would interfere with a ``pending criminal
and civil investigation by the United States Attorney's office for
the District of Massachusetts,'' according to the letter to
Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, a New York Republican.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging the existence of the investigation, Earl H.
Nemser of New York, Shleifer's lawyer, said his client was not
being targeted in the probe. ``My understanding is that it does not
involve Mr. Shleifer,'' Nemser said Wednesday. Thursday, Nemser
declined to answer further questions, including whether he
represented Shleifer's wife, Nancy Zimmerman, in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Although they could not be reached this week, Zimmerman, Hay _
who is no longer associated with Harvard _ and his girlfriend,
Elizabeth Hebert, have all previously denied they engaged in any
conflicts of interest by investing in Russian markets.
</P>
<P>
   However, an investigation by the US Agency for International
Development, which funded the $43 million contract, found that
Shleifer and Hay had ``gained influence'' over Russian capital
markets they were helping to set up, and had ``abused the trust of
the United States government by using personal relationships . . .
for private gain.'' Among the allegations: Hay invested in Russian
government securities while advising the Yeltsin government on
capital markets; and helped Hebert establish a Russian mutual fund,
the first allowed to sell such funds to the Russian public.
</P>
<P>
   A second charge, that Hay directed a second center he and the
institute established with USAID funds to assist Zimmerman in her
Russian investments, was determined to be unfounded by a World Bank
audit. But the damage was already done: In May 1997, AID canceled
its contract with the Harvard institute, cutting off the final $14
million installment of a $57 million grant.

U.S. TO ALLOW ORGANIC LABEL ON SOME MEATS AND POULTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Wis., Mass., Iowa) (nk) 
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON The Department of Agriculture announced Thursday that
it would allow farmers who raise meat and poultry without
pesticide-treated feed, growth hormones or antibiotics to label
their meat ``certified organic.''
</P>
<P>
   That meat will be the only organic food with a certification
process approved by the federal government. State regulations for
years have allowed organic labels on many other foods, but meat and
poultry have always been in a different category, subject to more
stringent federal labeling regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The federal rules go into effect immediately, and need no
legislative approval. They are welcomed by companies that grow
organic meat, who have been frustrated in attempts to market a
premium product. Many foods labeled organic sell for 10 percent to
50 percent above the price of similar nonorganic foods.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the Agriculture Department treated the organic food
industry as if it did not exist. But as sales grew more than 20
percent a year through the 1990s, organic food came to account for
$1 of every $100 spent on food, and in 1997 the agency took notice,
proposing national organic standards for all food.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal met with stiff resistance from more than 275,000
people who said they opposed the federal standards because they
would lower the state standards already in place. In an unusual
move the agency withdrew the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   An Agriculture Department spokesman described the new meat and
poultry policy as ``an interim step,'' until national standards
exist, which may come next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a boon for small companies like us,'' said Allen
Shainsky, owner of Petaluma Poultry Processors in Petaluma, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Shainsky's company sells around 120,000 birds per week, and he
said he hoped to be selling 15,000 organic birds a week within a
few months.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Moody, a feed coordinator for the Coulee Region Organic
Produce Pool, or Cropp, in LaFarge, Wis., which sells its products
under the Organic Valley label, said: ``This means a lot to us. We
have not been able to get full value out of our beef cattle, our
dairy cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of going out with a national marketing program, it
has been impossible, and we have not been able to realize the true
value of our animal production,'' Moody said. ``It has held the
livestock industry back.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman said he hoped Thursday's
announcement would also help the meat industry, particularly hog
farmers who have seen prices for pork as low as 9 cents a pound.
The current price is 28 cents a pound for live hogs, compared with
35 cents last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Moody said, there is more profit in organic meat
than in conventional meat. He said he expected to sell organic pork
for 60 to 70 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department will rely on state and industry
certifiers as it allows producers to use the organic label. Those
standards require third-party certification that the meat and
poultry are raised on organic feed, without the use of antibiotics
or growth hormones, that they have access to the outside and that
there is a manure management plan. If an animal becomes ill and
must be given antibiotics it can no longer be sold as organic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this announcement is a sign that organic is one of the
Secretary's top priorities,'' said Katherine DeMatteo, executive
director of the Organic Trade Association in Greenfield, Mass.,
``that he is serious about working out details of the final rule
for national organic standards. The secretary has seen that this
will create new opportunities to help small farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman acted after a letter-writing campaign in the fall from
small meat and poultry producers. Opposition from the national beef
industry was quite mild. Alisa Harrison, a spokeswoman for the
National Cattlemen's Association, said the association was
``generally supportive of niche marketing and giving consumers a
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Our only concern, Ms. Harrison said, ``is that consumers
understand that products labeled organic are not safer than
products that are not labeled organic.''

   Turning the Tables &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ MARTHA STEWART is once again making history in the
design world as only she can.
</P>
<P>
   She is having the coolly elegant International Style tables and
chairs removed from the Four Seasons restaurant, the pricey
province of publishing and financial types, so that she can bring
in patio furniture with umbrellas that will be sold at Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stewart and Kmart will hold a private party next Thursday to
show off outdoor tables and chairs, along with watering cans, hoses
and ``horticultural maintenance products.'' That means designer
potting soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pool party in the Pool Room,'' said JULIAN NICCOLINI,
an owner of the restaurant, on East 52nd Street near Park Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the history part: He said that it would be the first
time the restaurant had ever taken out its tables and chairs. ``I
have to start the night before, at midnight,'' he said. ``I had to
rent space in our building to put away our furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   Book Talk
</P>
<P>
   Author and philanthropist TINA SANTI FLAHERTY gave real-estate
developer LEWIS RUDIN a big introduction at a party for her latest
book, ``Talk Your Way to the Top.'' She said he was one of the top
talkers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Then she turned the microphone over to him.
</P>
<P>
   He said exactly five words. ``Thank you very much, Tina.''
</P>
<P>
   He sat down.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Flaherty introduced three others as ``top talkers'' _
columnist LIZ SMITH, film producer MARTY RICHARDS and JOHN HUME,
the head of the Social Democratic and Labor Party in Northern
Ireland and a winner of the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Hume said each of them had been asked to speak for two minutes
apiece. He had been talking for nearly six minutes when he was
interrupted by applause. That was after he had mentioned the Tina
and William E. Flaherty Cultural Center at the Oscar Wilde House of
the American College in Dublin. Ms. Flaherty and her husband, the
chairman of Horsehead Industries, a zinc mining and manufacturing
company, got their names over the door after they gave $250,000 to
refurbish the building.
</P>
<P>
   Hume went on for three more minutes, telling what he had said at
the opening of a bar in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was exceeding his two minutes,'' his wife, PAT, said later.
``That's what I was conscious of.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen years ago Wednesday, an Air Florida jet crashed in a
snowstorm moments after taking off from National Airport in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Author WARREN ADLER remembers. First he worried that his son had
been in a car on Memorial Bridge that was crushed as the plane went
down. (It turned out that it was not his son's car.)
</P>
<P>
   Then someone gave him a police report about the accident. That
inspired him to write a novel, ``Random Hearts'' (Macmillan, 1983).
</P>
<P>
   He sold the novel to Hollywood in 1983. First DUSTIN HOFFMAN was
to star, then KEVIN COSTNER.
</P>
<P>
   The book is out of print. But Ballantine is bringing it out a
new edition, for next week the film version _ now starring HARRISON
FORD and KRISTIN SCOTT THOMAS _ will finish shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a resurrection,'' Adler said Thusday.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a character named ORLYN LOCKHART in the next
mystery novel by LINDA FAIRSTEIN, and the real Orlyn Lockhart (Skip
to his friends) could not be happier.
</P>
<P>
   He paid $520 for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fairstein, the head of the sex crimes unit in the Manhattan
district attorney's office, is the author of two mysteries; a third
will be published later in the year. She let her alma mater, the
University of Virginia Law School, include the character-naming
(for her fourth) in an auction to raise money for fellowships for
law students interested in public service careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty good name,'' said Ms. Fairstein, who has
written one chapter of novel No. 4 so far. ``I've just sent a
letter asking if he minds being an evil character. It's such a
great name for a villain.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, a second-year student, had no problem with that.
``Actually, I would prefer it.''

TROUBLED RUSSIA SEEKING INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Soviet foreign trade missions touring the West in
decades past parried questions about shoddy production and
shortages as they scouted out equipment for Moscow's industrial
machine.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the brash and wealthy tycoons of Russia's new
entrepreneurial elite courted international bankers with promises
of oil and mining riches.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of a decade, Moscow went from conducting little
more than strategic, limited trade with the West to seducing
investors into what was called the world's last great emerging
market.
</P>
<P>
   Now, five months after the ruble sank and Russia's economic
tailspin quickened, sweeping into power Soviet-era officials and
placing a question mark over the country's future, Moscow is
starting to embrace a tough new realism toward foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   The government, shunning quick-buck artists, now seeks long-term
investors. Skeptical Western firms want a sense the new Russia is
safe. Top officials and executives from both sides converge Friday
on Harvard University for a conference on investing in Russia to
assay the promise and perils of a country wracked by change.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion and frustration among foreign investors have kept
Russia near the bottom of the investment ladder since 1991, when
the Soviet collapse ushered in a doomed experiment with
Western-style capitalism. With around $16 billion, a third from US
companies, Russia has fewer outside direct investment dollars than
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   But now investors seem more flummoxed than ever. Since the
embarrassing collapse of the International Monetary Fund's loan
program in August _ when Moscow devalued its currency, defaulted on
$40 billion in debt, and rattled world markets _ companies ranging
from Texas oil giants to Boston investment firms have all but
frozen their Russia projects.
</P>
<P>
   A few have forged ahead, brushing aside inadequate laws and
fears of political instability before the presidential poll next
year. Germany's Ruhrgas gas group recently bought a 2.5 percent
stake in Gazprom, the world's largest gas firm, for $660 million.
Exxon Corp. has moved ahead with exploration and production plans
off Sakhalin Island in Russia's Far East.
</P>
<P>
   But many more have retreated, frightened after the failure of
seven years of reforms. Pioneer Group Inc., an investment firm in
Boston, has scaled back or exited projects ranging from banking and
securities to logging and gold mining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most corporations have postponed, delayed, or scrapped plans
for foreign direct investment, and I would guess that for the next
two years, you'll see little, if any,'' said Mark Madden, a
portfolio manager for Pioneer's Emerging Markets fund. Overall,
hundreds of billions in planned foreign investment projects are now
on hold or shelved.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, the gun-slinging days of portfolio investment,
or trade in Russian shares, are over _ and not just because
Russia's stock market fell 85 percent last year. Rather, Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, a brainy former spymaster feared by the
West, wants long-haul investors who will put money into factories,
not stock investors who take profits and run.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the government now wants are approaches to foreign
investment that are mutually advantageous, and that is very
rational,'' said Gennady Talalayev, spokesman for Sistema, a
Russian holding company with a stake in Moscow's telephone network
as well as oil, hotel, and media assets.
</P>
<P>
   That's reasonable, says Konstantin A. Titov, the personable
mayor of the Samara region and an influential player in Parliament,
where he heads the upper house's budget, taxation, and finance
committee. ``Russia absolutely needs foreign investment,'' Titov
said. ``But what we can count on is another question.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, most Western investment has come from natural
resources firms, mainly oil. Despite growing anti-Western sentiment
in the regions where vast oil fields lie,
</P>
<P>
   Primakov is promising the passing of laws energy investors need.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, there have been small but promising signs.
</P>
<P>
   Disenchanted with ailing President Boris N. Yeltsin's unruly
reforms, yet far from returning to the Cold War command economy,
Primakov has so far been able to accomplish for investors what his
predecessors could not.
</P>
<P>
   With a coalition government blending Communists and liberals,
Primakov has wide support at home. In past months, he has cut taxes
and pushed crucial oil legislation through the State Duma, the
lower parliament house. He has so far resisted calls for
renationalizing key assets. Most of all, businessmen say, Primakov
has brought a measure of calm to a country that months ago appeared
to be coming apart at the seams.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the dire predictions _ `oh my God, it's back to the Soviet
system' _ have just not come true,'' said Eugene Lawson, president
of the US-Russia Business Council in Washington, D.C., which
represents American companies in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's three-day, third annual conference, notable for its
ability to put power players in the same room, has added
significance this year. IMF, World Bank, and Treasury officials,
while distracted over Brazil's collapse, are keen for insights into
Yuri Maslyukov, Russia's first deputy prime minister in charge of
the economy. Maslyukov, the former head of Gosplan, the Soviet
planning agency, is often reticent about his plans for the economy.
He counts, so far in vain, on more than $5 billion in IMF loans for
his budget this year.
</P>
<P>
   But these are different times _ both for Russia, which must cope
with the consequences of burning the IMF and investors, and for the
West, whose recipe for curing Russia failed.
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, New York bankers and consultants trawled
Cambridge's Hyatt Regency Hotel, where the conference takes place,
for Siberian oil executives interested in deals. Russian tycoon
Boris Berezovsky brushed shoulders with investor-philanthropist
George Soros, who slammed Moscow's privatization program even as he
benefited from it. Massaging Russia's bruises from Asian turmoil,
the IMF spoke of progress, albeit slow, in reforms.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Berezovsky and Soros are noticeably absent, their
stars dim before the Primakov government or their hard-driving
capitalist philosophies tarnished in Moscow's eyes. What one
conference organizer calls ``the tourist investors'' _ small
companies poking around _ are nowhere to be seen. And the low world
oil prices that now make most Russian energy deals unprofitable
have kept most oil companies away. ``Only heavy hitters that could
absorb a shock are here,'' organizer Fiona Hill said, citing
General Motors and Dutch electronics maker Philips, among others.
</P>
<P>
   So which areas does Russia want investors to consider?
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications, for one, if the arrival of the country's
entire telecoms elite is any indication. And aerospace. The
Khrunichev Space Center wants to do a thriving trade in commercial
satellite launches. Meanwhile, scores of research and design
bureaus seek to revive aircraft manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are _ nuclear cities? The US Department of Energy,
nervous about loose materiel and cash-starved scientists, paid for
parties ranging from the deputy atomic energy minister to
executives from the Snezhinsk Explosive Devices and Industrial
Waste site, in the Ural Mountains, to come make their pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more realistically, Titov, the Samara governor, suggests
attention should be paid to pharmaceuticals, packaging, and food
processing _ light industrial and consumer goods areas neglected
under Communism. In a country with bloated enterprise staffs and a
costly social safety net, such industries may be less profitable.
But with men like Titov in the ascendance _ the governor embraces
market-style reforms while ruling with an iron fist _ such sectors
are increasingly what Russia wants foreigners to eye.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, investors may not be in the mood _ especially since
Russia's economy will contract by up to 15 percent this year,
inflationary money presses are whirring, and currency restrictions
are growing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Hill, ``people want to restore contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this is simply designed to get out the message,'' she
said, ``that Russia is open for business.''

NOTES FROM THE SENATE GALLERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the oddest parts of Thursday's impeachment
trial proceedings was seeing the august Senate turned into a
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   For veteran Senate watchers, it was somewhat disquieting to see
the historic chamber so transformed. It is an institution that
almost never changes, physically or otherwise, and looks remarkably
as it did in the classic movie ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,''
which featured scenes shot in a mock-up of the Senate gallery, with
busts of  &UR; Thomas Jefferson, John Adams and other patriots gazing
into the well.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Senate floor, normally considered hallowed
ground and reserved for senators, their officers, pages and
selected staff members, opened its doors to President Clinton's
lawyers and to House members prosecuting the case. Long, black
tables were positioned on each side of the Senate president's chair
to accommodate all of the visiting lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere was different, too. Typically, the Senate chamber
is largely empty, filling up only when the lawmakers are voting or
engaged in a debate.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the chamber was full. Odder still, the members were
all sitting quietly at their desks, listening to strangers.
</P>
<P>
   As opening arguments began, Sen.  &UR; Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., sat with his
chin resting in his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   With the other hand, he balanced a legal pad against his desk.
Occasionally, he jotted a note.
</P>
<P>
   To Kyl's immediate left sat a stern-looking  &UR; Fred Thompson,
R-Tenn. And next to Thompson was Sen.  &UR; John McCain, R-Ariz., who
leaned back in his chair and folded his hands in front of him as if
he were attending church.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps strangest of all was hearing speeches in the harsh
language of prosecuting attorneys instead of the flowery, inflated
prose of senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would the distinguished gentleman from Arizona yield for a
question?'' is typical Senate fare.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, the facade of decorum was stripped away as
House members described Clinton's sexual relationship with a White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
   In the press gallery, some novices hoped to bring portable
telephones, computers or tape recorders into the chamber to record
the historic event. They were told that no electronic equipment is
allowed, save for several C-SPAN cameras.
</P>
<P>
   At least some things never change. &QL; 
 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   An Orthodox patriot . . . It's no fun to work on the weekend,
especially when your job is to sit in silence, listening to lawyers
argue for removing the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   But for Sen.  &UR; Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., the Senate's only
Orthodox Jew, this weekend's task is complicated further by the
Sabbath, which begins at sundown Friday and ends at sundown
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously not going to be the kind of Sabbath I normally
like to spend, but I think we can, you know, work it out,'' said
Lieberman, who won't answer the phone, ride in an elevator or turn
on a light during the Sabbath observance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Lieberman says his responsibility as a juror in Clinton's
impeachment trial comes before his personal preferences, even in
matters of religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, the continuing pursuit of justice takes
precedent, and therefore, without any hesitation, I'll be there,''
Lieberman told reporters this week. &QL;

SEN. KYL DEFENDS ROLE IN PRIVATE MEETING WITH HOUSE GOP ON
WITNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Jon Kyl, caught in a controversy that
threatened to tip the Senate's precarious bipartisan balance, on
Thursday defended his role in a private meeting with House
Republicans on their demand to call witnesses at the impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl, R-Ariz., said characterizations of the meeting as
``secret'' were incorrect, while acknowledging that it was held in
private and that Democrats had been invited only belatedly. Nothing
had been decided behind Democrats' backs, Kyl asserted, on the
volatile issue of whether witnesses will be summoned during the
Senate trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats remained suspicious Thursday, accusing Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott of double-crossing them by directing the small
group of Republican senators to meet behind closed doors with the
House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Democrats and Republicans reached a fragile agreement
to postpone the issue of calling witnesses until after opening
arguments from House managers and the White House, which began
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-hour party caucus that broke up shortly before
Thursday's opening arguments, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle
criticized the Republican-only meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly violates the spirit of the agreement we all
agreed to last week,'' said Daschle, who ordered Democrats to
boycott the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., voiced concern that Republican
meetings could undermine the Senate's earnest attempts to avoid the
clashes that split the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could lead to our making the same awful mistakes that the
House made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Democrats cried foul, they acknowledged that they
too had huddled behind closed doors with Democratic attorneys on
the House Judiciary Committee for a pretrial strategy session and a
briefing on weaknesses in the prosecution's case.
</P>
<P>
   The witness issue has divided the parties. Democrats generally
oppose having witnesses, but House Republicans believe they need
witness testimony to properly make their case against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Since the two parties had already decided to defer the matter,
some Democrats wondered why Kyl and other Senate Republicans would
privately take up the issue anew with Republican House prosecutors
this past Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A front-page article in ``The'' ``New York'' ``Times'' on
Thursday suggested that the Republicans might be plotting to
overturn the earlier accord. ``GOP Senators Meet Secretly With
Prosecutors on Witnesses,'' the headline said.
</P>
<P>
   The article quoted a spokeswoman for Daschle as saying she took
issue with the meeting's purpose. ``Senator Daschle's position is
that we voted on a unanimous bipartisan level to put off the
question of witnesses, so it would not be in keeping with that
agreement to start a discussion about whether to call witnesses,''
said spokeswoman Ranit Schmelzer.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl told ``The Arizona Republic'' the discussions were largely
procedural.
</P>
<P>
   ``Majority Leader Lott has asked three of us to meet with House
managers to get an idea of how many witnesses they wish to call,
how long it will take, and to convey some sense of the Senate's
thinking in creating the procedure we approved to deal with the
witness issue,'' Kyl wrote in his impeachment diary, excerpts of
which appear in today's ``Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing secret about it,'' Kyl said in a later
interview. ``They talked about some of the witnesses they wanted to
call. We never said you can't or you shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, Kyl said, did the senators give any assurances that
witnesses could be called.
</P>
<P>
   Possible trial witnesses include former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky, whose affair with the president precipitated the
investigation against him; presidential secretary Bettie Currie;
and Clinton confidante Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl said Democrats had been invited to attend the meeting,
albeit belatedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we met with the House managers, Sen. (Arlen) Specter said
we should have Democrats invited as well, and so he then invited
them. And then he also said, `I think we should see also if (White
House attorney) Charles Ruff and the White House people would like
to meet with us about anything.' And Ruff called back and
declined,'' Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tempest in teapot, and I consider it over,'' said
Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., one of the three senators, including
Kyl, who attended the meeting with House managers. ``I don't think
there's any further need to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   But Specter said that he House prosecutors' opening arguments
only underscored the need for witnesses, and that the small Senate
group would likely meet again with the House managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be more meetings in the future,'' Specter
said during a break in the trial. ``My view is that there ought to
be standards, not only on the witnesses, but also on the scope of
their testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   The tensions created by the meeting underscore the delicacy of
maintaining a balance of bipartisanship during the trial. Democrats
and Republicans disagree on nearly everything - even the need to
have a trial - but are committed to publicly cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   Such a meeting, involving impeachment jurors gathering privately
with prosecutor, would never be permitted in a criminal court. The
rules are different in an impeachment trial because of its
quasi-political nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had tried to lobby us about their case or say, `Look,
we need to call this person for this reason,' that would have been
improper. They did not do that,'' Kyl said. &QL;

GOP BEGINS CASE, SEEKS CLINTON TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Portraying Bill Clinton as a ``corrupt'' president
who ``will cause a cancer to be present in our society for
generations'' unless he is removed from office, House managers
opened their impeachment case Thursday amid new controversy over
potential witnesses, including Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred senators suspended their latest skirmish in the
witness dispute to sit in solemn silence as a battery of House
managers unleashed the opening salvo in their battle to end
Clinton's presidency over two articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is vital that when a cancer exists in our body politic, our
job _ our duty _ is to excise it,'' Representative James F.
Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin said in a blistering opening
statement, in the same Senate chamber where the last presidential
impeachment trial unfolded 131 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As some senators scribbled notes and others struggled to stay
awake in six hours of opening statements, the White House blasted
the House presentation even before it ended as ``both unsubstantial
and circumstantial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to presenting our defense based on the facts,
the law, and the Constitution,'' White House spokesman James
Kennedy said, as a winter storm blew through Washington amid the
tempest on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's fate in their hands, senators in both parties
generally praised the House managers, all Republicans, for
delivering a straightforward, if sometimes plodding, presentation
of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm impressed by the quality of the presentation, the
seriousness of the presentation, and the seriousness which members
are viewing this,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who has made no
secret that he considers Clinton's wrongdoing ``reprehensible'' but
too minor to warrant his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Several other Senate Democrats criticized the presentation as
repetitious and lacking in new evidence. The Senate majority
leader, Trent Lott, struck back in a biting statement released
Thursday night, saying he had ``advised Republican members not to
comment on the merits while the trial is in its active phase. A
number of Democrat senators, however, have complained they have
heard nothing new today. . . . If they wish something new they have
only to grant the House managers' desire to call live witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Senate chamber, the fragile truce that members struck
last week in forging a blueprint for the historic proceedings began
to crack, as the two parties divided over whether Clinton should
testify. Democrats also lashed at out at Republicans for meeting
independently with the House managers to discuss potential
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he should be invited, or at least I don't have a
problem with him being invited,'' said the assistant majority
leader, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Lott said he had yet to decide whether to invite
Clinton, but the question is ``on the verge of percolating'' with
the Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has said Clinton has no intention of testifying,
and Senate Democrats steadfastly oppose calling any witnesses. But
the drumbeat among Republicans for Clinton to explain his conduct
in the impeachment trial began to quicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that the president will have to testify, said
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican. ``That depends almost
entirely on whether or not he feels he has to come up here to make
his case because he may be having a more difficult time than he
currently anticipates.''
</P>
<P>
   Most senators believe Clinton can avoid conviction, which
requires a two-thirds majority, or 67 votes. He is charged with
lying under oath before a federal grand jury and obstructing
justice for trying to cover up his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky,
a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   A central element of last week's breakthrough blueprint for the
trial was an agreement to defer until Jan. 25 the question of
whether the House managers should even be allowed to call
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But House managers have acknowledged contacting a number of
potential witnesses this week, including lawyers for Lewinsky.
House aides said the managers also have interviewed Kathleen E.
Willey, a former White House volunteer who claims that the
president groped her near the Oval Office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a breach of the standard of bipartisanship and the notion
that we really are open-minded,'' said Senator John F. Kerry. ``If
they're already having meetings about witnesses, it seems to
indicate a predetermination about it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy called the development ``a matter of concern'' and one
of ``the glitches that may come up along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Democrats expressed strong indignation, including
Senator Barbara Boxer, who said, ``The bipartisan consensus . . .
has all broken apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they asked Democrats to participate in the
meeting with the House managers about potential witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They chose not to participate,'' said Senator Arlen Specter, a
Pennsylvania Republican. ``They didn't have any reason not to
participate. It was an important matter to establish standards for
witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter indicated that the meetings may continue between the
Senate Republicans and House managers. And the lead House manager,
Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, downplayed the outrage
among Senate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``They scream,'' he said after the opening arguments. ``That's
one thing they have a gift for _ they scream.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also countered that more than a dozen Democrats met
Wednesday night with Abbe E. Lowell, the chief investigative
counsel for Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, to prepare
for Thursday's opening arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be imprudent to overreact to either meeting,'' said a
spokesman for Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Lott did not address the issue publicly Thursday. But
immediately before the trial resumed, he met over lunch in the
Senate dining room with Specter and two Democratic senators, Joseph
R. Biden of Delaware and Charles E. Schumer, in what a Democratic
aide described as an effort ``to clean up the mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Some senators criticized both Republicans for meeting with the
House managers and Democrats for gathering with Lowell. ``I think
we would all be better off to sequester ourselves at this point,''
said Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The hurlyburly beyond the Senate floor posed a stark contrast to
the somber tone within the stately, 19th century chamber. Cautioned
by the sergeant-at-arms ``to remain silent on pain of
imprisonment,'' the senators mostly sat stone-faced through the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner, who has built a conservative legacy during 20
years in the House, appealed during his hourlong opening statement
for Democrats to view the charges against Clinton through the lens
of the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stem largely from Clinton's alleged attempt to
thwart the sexual harassment lawsuit that Paula Corbin Jones filed
against him and settled last year for $850,000. Clinton is accused
of trying to cover up his affair with Lewinsky partly to stymie the
Jones case, which the House managers said was made possible by the
movement for civil rights and equal rights that many Democrats
supported.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no time to abandon that struggle, no matter what the
public mood or the political consequence,'' Sensenbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Methodically, the House managers laid out the elements of their
case against Clinton, as many senators increasingly struggled to
sustain their attention. Indeed, several members appeared to drift
off as the day dragged on.
</P>
<P>
   The presiding officer, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist,
called only two short breaks during the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough not to snore,'' Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, a New
Jersey Democrat, said at a break. ``What happens is, your eyelids
start to take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde acknowledged that the six-hour-long statements, which
provided little new material on a subject that has been center
stage in Washington for months, had grown tedious at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was any fault in it, it was that they were too
long,'' Hyde said afterward. ``But they were comprehensive, and
remember, repetition is the soul of scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   Only when video images were aired of Clinton's deposition in the
Jones case and his testimony before a federal grand jury was there
nearly universal attention on the presentation.
</P>
<P>
   One scene featured Clinton's much publicized response to a
prosecutor's question about his relationship with Lewinksy. ``It
depends upon what the meaning of the word `is' is,'' Clinton was
seen as saying, in what a House manager, Representative James E.
Rogan of California, described as a prime example of Clinton's
tortured evasions in both legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the presentation by the House managers attacked
Clinton's misconduct, in which, Sensenbrenner alleged, the
president ``piled perjury upon perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sensenbrenner also said the White House counsel, Charles
F.C. Ruff, had evaded a question during the House impeachment
proceedings about whether Clinton had lied before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Ruff could have answered the question directly,''
Sensenbrenner said. ``He did not, and his failure to do so speaks a
thousand words.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, who sat with the White House legal team at a table across
the Senate well from the House managers, showed no visible reaction
to the statement. But after the proceedings, Gregory B. Craig,
White House special counsel, said Sensenbrenner had ``falsely
characterized Mr. Ruff's testimony to use it against the president,
and he misled the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ruff had responded to Sensenbrenner's question in the
House proceeding by saying in part that a description of Clinton's
testimony as ``evasive, misleading and maddening is probably as
good as you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner issued a statement standing by his criticism of
Ruff.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Soviet foreign trade missions touring the West in
decades past parried questions about shoddy production and
shortages as they scouted out equipment for Moscow's industrial
machine.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the brash and wealthy tycoons of Russia's new
entrepreneurial elite courted international bankers with promises
of oil and mining riches.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of a decade, Moscow went from conducting little
more than strategic, limited trade with the West to seducing
investors into what was called the world's last great emerging
market.
</P>
<P>
   Now, five months after the ruble sank and Russia's economic
tailspin quickened, sweeping into power Soviet-era officials and
placing a question mark over the country's future, Moscow is
starting to embrace a tough new realism toward foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   The government, shunning quick-buck artists, now seeks long-term
investors. Skeptical Western firms want a sense the new Russia is
safe. Top officials and executives from both sides converge Friday
on Harvard University for a conference on investing in Russia to
assay the promise and perils of a country wracked by change.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion and frustration among foreign investors have kept
Russia near the bottom of the investment ladder since 1991, when
the Soviet collapse ushered in a doomed experiment with
Western-style capitalism. With around $16 billion, a third from US
companies, Russia has fewer outside direct investment dollars than
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   But now investors seem more flummoxed than ever. Since the
embarrassing collapse of the International Monetary Fund's loan
program in August _ when Moscow devalued its currency, defaulted on
$40 billion in debt, and rattled world markets _ companies ranging
from Texas oil giants to Boston investment firms have all but
frozen their Russia projects.
</P>
<P>
   A few have forged ahead, brushing aside inadequate laws and
fears of political instability before the presidential poll next
year. Germany's Ruhrgas gas group recently bought a 2.5 percent
stake in Gazprom, the world's largest gas firm, for $660 million.
Exxon Corp. has moved ahead with exploration and production plans
off Sakhalin Island in Russia's Far East.
</P>
<P>
   But many more have retreated, frightened after the failure of
seven years of reforms. Pioneer Group Inc., an investment firm in
Boston, has scaled back or exited projects ranging from banking and
securities to logging and gold mining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most corporations have postponed, delayed, or scrapped plans
for foreign direct investment, and I would guess that for the next
two years, you'll see little, if any,'' said Mark Madden, a
portfolio manager for Pioneer's Emerging Markets fund. Overall,
hundreds of billions in planned foreign investment projects are now
on hold or shelved.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, the gun-slinging days of portfolio investment,
or trade in Russian shares, are over _ and not just because
Russia's stock market fell 85 percent last year. Rather, Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, a brainy former spymaster feared by the
West, wants long-haul investors who will put money into factories,
not stock investors who take profits and run.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the government now wants are approaches to foreign
investment that are mutually advantageous, and that is very
rational,'' said Gennady Talalayev, spokesman for Sistema, a
Russian holding company with a stake in Moscow's telephone network
as well as oil, hotel, and media assets.
</P>
<P>
   That's reasonable, says Konstantin A. Titov, the personable
mayor of the Samara region and an influential player in Parliament,
where he heads the upper house's budget, taxation, and finance
committee. ``Russia absolutely needs foreign investment,'' Titov
said. ``But what we can count on is another question.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, most Western investment has come from natural
resources firms, mainly oil. Despite growing anti-Western sentiment
in the regions where vast oil fields lie,
</P>
<P>
   Primakov is promising the passing of laws energy investors need.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, there have been small but promising signs.
</P>
<P>
   Disenchanted with ailing President Boris N. Yeltsin's unruly
reforms, yet far from returning to the Cold War command economy,
Primakov has so far been able to accomplish for investors what his
predecessors could not.
</P>
<P>
   With a coalition government blending Communists and liberals,
Primakov has wide support at home. In past months, he has cut taxes
and pushed crucial oil legislation through the State Duma, the
lower parliament house. He has so far resisted calls for
renationalizing key assets. Most of all, businessmen say, Primakov
has brought a measure of calm to a country that months ago appeared
to be coming apart at the seams.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the dire predictions _ `oh my God, it's back to the Soviet
system' _ have just not come true,'' said Eugene Lawson, president
of the US-Russia Business Council in Washington, D.C., which
represents American companies in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's three-day, third annual conference, notable for its
ability to put power players in the same room, has added
significance this year. IMF, World Bank, and Treasury officials,
while distracted over Brazil's collapse, are keen for insights into
Yuri Maslyukov, Russia's first deputy prime minister in charge of
the economy. Maslyukov, the former head of Gosplan, the Soviet
planning agency, is often reticent about his plans for the economy.
He counts, so far in vain, on more than $5 billion in IMF loans for
his budget this year.
</P>
<P>
   But these are different times _ both for Russia, which must cope
with the consequences of burning the IMF and investors, and for the
West, whose recipe for curing Russia failed.
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, New York bankers and consultants trawled
Cambridge's Hyatt Regency Hotel, where the conference takes place,
for Siberian oil executives interested in deals. Russian tycoon
Boris Berezovsky brushed shoulders with investor-philanthropist
George Soros, who slammed Moscow's privatization program even as he
benefited from it. Massaging Russia's bruises from Asian turmoil,
the IMF spoke of progress, albeit slow, in reforms.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Berezovsky and Soros are noticeably absent, their
stars dim before the Primakov government or their hard-driving
capitalist philosophies tarnished in Moscow's eyes. What one
conference organizer calls ``the tourist investors'' _ small
companies poking around _ are nowhere to be seen. And the low world
oil prices that now make most Russian energy deals unprofitable
have kept most oil companies away. ``Only heavy hitters that could
absorb a shock are here,'' organizer Fiona Hill said, citing
General Motors and Dutch electronics maker Philips, among others.
</P>
<P>
   So which areas does Russia want investors to consider?
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications, for one, if the arrival of the country's
entire telecoms elite is any indication. And aerospace. The
Khrunichev Space Center wants to do a thriving trade in commercial
satellite launches. Meanwhile, scores of research and design
bureaus seek to revive aircraft manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are _ nuclear cities? The US Department of Energy,
nervous about loose materiel and cash-starved scientists, paid for
parties ranging from the deputy atomic energy minister to
executives from the Snezhinsk Explosive Devices and Industrial
Waste site, in the Ural Mountains, to come make their pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more realistically, Titov, the Samara governor, suggests
attention should be paid to pharmaceuticals, packaging, and food
processing _ light industrial and consumer goods areas neglected
under Communism. In a country with bloated enterprise staffs and a
costly social safety net, such industries may be less profitable.
But with men like Titov in the ascendance _ the governor embraces
market-style reforms while ruling with an iron fist _ such sectors
are increasingly what Russia wants foreigners to eye.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, investors may not be in the mood _ especially since
Russia's economy will contract by up to 15 percent this year,
inflationary money presses are whirring, and currency restrictions
are growing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Hill, ``people want to restore contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this is simply designed to get out the message,'' she
said, ``that Russia is open for business.''

NEVER MIND: JOHNSON OPTS TO STAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because of his job commitments, Jimmy Johnson missed his
mother's wake last month. He made it to the funeral the next day,
but now he realizes there is more to life than a game plan.
</P>
<P>
   He realizes that when the time comes for his funeral, he might
be remembered as a great football coach who won a national
championship at the University of Miami and two Super Bowls with
the Dallas Cowboys. But he also knows he could leave a legacy for
working up to 16 hours a day, for an obsession with his profession
that cost him a marriage and drastically limited the amount of time
he spent with his two sons and his beloved parents.
</P>
<P>
   Such reflections prompted Johnson to make a career decision that
hit South Florida like a hurricane Wednesday: He would leave the
Miami Dolphins after three seasons as general manager-coach and two
playoff appearances.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't go through with it. But he did make some changes that
he hopes will enhance his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Johnson decided to stay on the job after a morning
meeting with Dolphins owner Wayne Huzienga. But from now on, he'll
have more help.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Wannstedt, recently fired as the Chicago Bears' coach and a
longtime Johnson confidant, will rejoin him as assistant head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing both his change of heart and administration, Johnson
may have forever altered the public's perception of him as an
uptight control freak. Hair perfectly in place, wearing a snappy
suit as he stood at a podium in Davie, Fla., he trembled and cried
as he spoke about the changes in his life and how he would step
back _ maybe a little, maybe a lot _ to allow Wannstedt's input.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a time you pull back and you say, `Be with people you
care about. Don't shortchange them,' '' said Johnson. ``That's what
I plan on doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A month ago, I started a very trying period. Mother (Allene)
passed away, and we went through some times that opened up my
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said 34 years of football had ``cost me spending time with my
sons, cost me a marriage, and when Mother died, I realized I needed
time with the people I really care about.''
</P>
<P>
   He indicated that he will devote more time to his two sons and
his father, C.W., who is battling cancer at his home in Port
Arthur, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   At age 55, Jimmy Johnson apparently has experienced an epiphany.
For so long, he was caught up on the coaching roller coaster. Once
you've won as Johnson has, fans demand that you win again and
again. That has not happened in Miami, though progress was made
this season as the Dolphins went 10-6 and beat the Buffalo Bills in
an AFC wild-card playoff before getting routed at Denver, 38-3,
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson acknowledged that he may find it difficult to alter his
professional approach. But he will try to make the 16-hour days
less frequent; when he feels like taking off early, Wannstedt, his
assistant head coach and defensive coordinator in Dallas, will take
over.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption is that Wannstedt will become head coach next
year or the year after, with Johnson either focusing exclusively on
his GM duties or retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``My determination and my commitment is not one bit less than it
was before,'' Johnson said. ``But I will spend a few more hours
with my family. For some of you, you have me for at least one more
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had walked into Dolphins president Eddie Jones's office
a few days ago and mentioned quitting. On Wednesday night, Huizenga
was informed of Johnson's decision and left the baseball meetings
in California, where he was completing the sale of the Florida
Marlins, to speak with his coach.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was attended by quarterback Dan Marino, who also
wanted to talk Johnson out of retirement because ``we're so close
to a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that we're a couple of playmakers away
offensively from getting that championship,'' said Johnson, who is
signed through 2000 after agreeing to a one-year extension.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Wannstedt would be a ``true'' assistant head coach
in that he will ``work with all three areas _ offense, defense,
special teams _ just like I do. He was my assistant head coach in
Dallas; his role will be expanded here.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson didn't fulfill his prediction that he would bring a
championship to Miami in three years. The job has been much tougher
than he envisioned. When he replaced Don Shula, he inherited a team
with terrible salary cap problems, and it has taken this long to be
free of those obligations. In the meantime, Johnson has changed the
roster dramatically, gone with young, aggressive players, and found
a way to coexist with Marino after a shaky start. He tried to
achieve his goal of a run-oriented offense in 1998 and did it well
for much of the year, but in the end, Marino's passing was the key
ingredient, as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to do everything in my power to bring a
championship to the Miami Dolphins within three years,'' Johnson
said. ``Although I'm disappointed that we didn't win a
championship, I really believe that we are really, really close.''
</P>
<P>
   In summing up his new approach, he said, ``My commitment and my
resolve and my efforts are not diminished, not one bit. If
anything, with another person here that I care about, I feel even
more responsibility to get the job done. I want to win a
championship and I want us to win it this year.''

 IMMIGRANT PARENTS' FEARS KEEP KIDS OFF HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By LOUIS FREEDBERG and SABIN RUSSELL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Gerardo Zendejas, a 30-year-old Mexican
immigrant, now can buy government-subsidized health insurance for
his 4-year-old daughter for as little as $6 a month, with dental
and eyeglass benefits tossed in for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   But Zendejas, who works part-time at a discount electronics
store on Fisherman's Wharf, won't touch the new federally funded
health insurance program signed into law by President Clinton in
August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone. Among the parents of 1.7 million uninsured
children in California, only a fraction have signed up their
children for coverage under Healthy Families, the state's name for
the new program.
</P>
<P>
   That reluctance is raising fears among health officials that a
significant portion of California's immigrant population will grow
up without health care that is now readily available, resulting in
higher costs to the state down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple. Zendejas, who has become a U.S. citizen,
is afraid that by signing up his child, who also is a U.S. citizen,
he will jeopardize the citizenship applications he has submitted to
the Immigration and Naturalization Service on behalf of his wife
and two other children who were not born in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Zendejas, like tens of thousands of other immigrants, is fearful
that he will become a victim of a 100-year-old federal law that
allows the government to deny citizenship to immigrants who have
used certain public benefits and thus are deemed to be ``public
charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, ``public charges'' could be billed for the costs
of benefits their families have received, and, more important,
could be denied permanent residence or U.S. citizenship as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   `I know it will cause trouble for me when I apply for papers for
my family,'' Zendejas said. His lawyer has advised him as much.
``He said, `Don't apply for anything, don't take any chances.'''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Zendejas has managed to cover his children's most urgent
health expenses by paying for them out of pocket, or by going to a
charitable health clinic run by the Catholic church. Should his
family have a health emergency, he said, ``I'd prefer to borrow
money from my boss'' than rely on government help.
</P>
<P>
   Such attitudes are frustrating an effort by states and the
federal government to provide insurance to an estimated 10.7
million children who are uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   With much fanfare, California last July introduced its Healthy
Families program, which grants insurance to low-income children
whose parents make from the poverty level up to twice the poverty
rate. The state spent $14 million on a media and public education
campaign to promote the new  &LR; program, which Governor Gray Davis
already has asked to be expanded modestly.
</P>
<P>
   But so far only 56,000 of the estimated 400,000 eligible have
signed up. One trend that worries health officials is that
enrollments have declined during over  &LR; the past two months, after
reaching a peak of 12,400 in October.
</P>
<P>
   For all the eligible children that the state fails to sign up by
October 2000, &UR;  &LR; the portion of federal grants that would have
covered them will be withdrawn and distributed to other states.
</P>
<P>
   Of equal concern to officials is the large number of children
living below the poverty line in California who are eligible to
sign up for Medi-Cal, the federally funded health care program for
the poor, but whose parents have declined to participate.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, evidence strongly suggests that the number of immigrant
children enrolled in Medi-Cal is declining _ at the same time state
and federal officials are trying to boost participation.
</P>
<P>
   ```I firmly believe that the single largest outstanding barrier
to enrollment of children is federal immigration policy,'' said Kim
Belshe, state health director.
</P>
<P>
   Six times during the past year, Belshe has urged the Clinton
administration to issue an unequivocal statement that signing up
for children's health insurance would not be used to label an
immigrant a ``public charge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very legitimate concern,'' said an administration
official who requested anonymity. ``But we have to make sure what
we are able to do falls within the confines of the law.'' The White
House has set up an interagency task force which is still looking
into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The official pointed out that the public charge law is only one
reason immigrants are not signing up. Others include lack of
knowledge about the program, the cost of monthly premiums and
complicated enrollment procedures.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that California requires applicants to fill out a
29-page application form that even immigrants fluent in English
find daunting. Now, there is a simplified four-page application
under review, expected to replace the long form in March.
</P>
<P>
   But immigrants like Violeta Lopez say that a clear-cut statement
from Washington would make a difference in helping her decide
whether to sign up her children.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez takes her two children, Kevin, 2, and Heydi, 9, to the
Mission Neighborhood Health Center in San Francisco when they are
sick and pays for the visits in cash. After a recent visit, the $20
exam was not a problem, but the $235 bill for an X-ray was.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Guatemala who has lived in the United States for 10
ten  &LR; years, Lopez works in a Mission District program for battered
women. ``Yes, I am afraid,'' she said, when asked why she has not
signed up her children for the federal program. ``But if they gave
me something, in writing, that it would not affect my citizenship
in the future, then I would take the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past year, heads of both Health Care Finance
Administration, the federal agency administering the child health
insurance programs, as well as the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, have issued letters, couched in dense legalese, that tried
to assure immigrants that signing up their children would not
jeopardize their immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   But these pronouncements have done little to assuage the deep
and widespread fears of immigrants. They stem from stories that
have swirled through immigrant communities about immigrants, both
legal and illegal, caught at airports or border-crossing points and
ordered to pay back the costs of benefits they have received.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for example, the state Health Department
established the Port of Entry Detection Program in 1990, stationing
health officers at several border posts near San Diego, as well as
at the San Francisco and Los Angeles airports. Under the program,
the state demanded that nearly 10,000 immigrants reimburse the
state for the services they received.
</P>
<P>
   After the Friends of San Diego Legal Aid filed a lawsuit, the
state last month agreed to scale back the program. It also promised
to refund the nearly 1,000 immigrants who paid the state from
$2,000 to $3,000 to cover their Medi-Cal costs.
</P>
<P>
   Another program _ the Public Charge Lookout System, run by the
U.S. State Department _ has had a similarly chilling effect. State
officials in 10 states, including California, agreed to provide
information to U.S. immigration officials, who in some instances
told applicants for green cards that they had to reimburse states
for Medicaid benefits before agreeing to process their
applications. That program was discontinued after protests by
immigrant groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the lingering effects of these efforts have depressed
enrollments in the new insurance programs, especially in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, chief of the Health Care Finance
Administration, said one answer could be relying more on community
organizations to explain to immigrants that they have little to
fear.
</P>
<P>
   Health clinics in San Francisco's Chinatown have achieved
success by doing just that. Of the 3,000 San Francisco children who
have enrolled in California's Healthy Families program, 90 percent
are Chinese. A study by the Health Access Foundation concluded that
the high enrollments of Chinese children was a direct result of
aggressive outreach programs launched by Chinatown health
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But immigration advocates say that unless the federal government
removes the threat of being labelled a public charge, there is is
only so much community groups can do. ``People should be lining up
for this program,'' said Tanya Broder of the National Immigration
Law Center in Oakland. ``That was a goal of both the administration
and the states, but it is just not happening.''

HOW NEW YORK CITY'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS FAILED ATHLETICS  (Eds: see also

HIGHSCHOOL-DANIELS)
(ART ADV: A photo is being sent. Non-subscribers can make
individual purchase by calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.)  By KIRK JOHNSON and JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The breakdown of public school athletics in New York
City over the last quarter century was to a great extent a matter
of impersonal forces and unintended consequences. But in equally
large part, the fate of school sports was determined by individuals
_ people who made a difference or who did not, who tried to defend
athletics or who stood idly by on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Reynolds fought back.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, the principal of West Side High School in Manhattan,
became so angry that the 350 students at his alternative school
could get no money from the city for sports that he formed his own
league and ran it himself. Organizing the city's expanding group of
smaller, specialized high schools beginning in the 1970s, Reynolds
pushed and prodded and insisted that sports for students mattered.
It worked.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the more than four dozen alternative high schools like West
Side get money from the Board of Education that, while paltry
compared to schools around much of the nation or in the New York
metropolitan area, is better than nothing. The schools now
participate in interscholastic sports alongside the oldest and
largest schools in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to yell,'' Reynolds said of the lessons he
learned in his battles over sports. ``But you do have to be
aggressive _ you have to continually lobby for your position, you
have write letters and organize meetings, you have to be sort of a
crusader,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, coaches, teachers and administrators across the city say,
Reynolds was an exception _ a principal who would go to the mat for
sports. Most others would not, or could not. The pattern of
de-emphasis of sports and physical education came from the top
down, as Board of Education administrators cut financing and never
restored it, and partly from the bottom up as parents stopped
caring as much or pushed for other school improvements. Principals
were caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Most took the meager amount of money doled out by the Public
Schools Athletic League _ the Board of Education's administrative
arm for high school sports _ and did what they could. They found
ways to raise more money or they eliminated a sport here or a gym
class there as they balanced their budgets and their needs for
books, materials and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Athletics programs, as they struggled, came more and more to
mirror everything that works and does not work about the New York
City school system: varying resources from neighborhood to
neighborhood, varying levels of commitment and ability from school
to school, and always and everywhere a seemingly constant conflict
over politics and labor and management and who was or should be in
charge. Schools chancellors came and went like waves on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Frank J. Macchiarola tried to rebuild some of the sports program
in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and the current schools chief,
Rudy Crew, has added back money in the late 1990s. But the deeper
structural problems remained.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the city's first concerted effort in years to rethink
and retool how it runs its high school sports programs, it has
decided that the answer is to decentralize authority further,
giving more responsibility to individual schools. What many
principals and teachers had seen as a symptom of the erosion in
commitment and money from the center _ decentralized sports
programs that seemed orphaned and at the mercy of neighborhood
economics _ now has been embraced as a cure.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, parts of which are being put in place now,
principals will be charged with insuring that athletes are
academically eligible and medically fit to compete and that coaches
are certified. Principals will enforce rules and assume legal
liability for mishaps or oversights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now trying to say to the principals, `It's your show,'''
said Thomas Hemans, the director of the PSAL, which has until now
scheduled games, set rules, hired officials and certified the
training of coaches since its creation in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   Some principals and teachers say the city is giving up on the
idea of systemwide improvement, while accepting the diminished
state that sports has assumed. Some say they believe that the
overhaul represents real hope of improvement. Still others say the
timing, coming in the middle of a pitched battle between the city
and the principals' union over tenure, promises to make school
sports more of a political issue than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Even principals who think the sports overhaul is a positive step
say that greater decentralization will make the inequities between
poor and middle-class schools more profound because each school
will be left more on its own than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is moving toward school-centered leadership teams,
everything is moving out, this is just in keeping with that whole
movement,'' said Thelma B. Baxter, the principal of Theodore
Roosevelt High School in the Fordham section of the Bronx; the
district has a 100 percent poverty rate among its students and no
athletic fields at all. ``But I think it's going to make it more
difficult for the schools to be competitive _ truly competitive.''
I can't tell you right now the amount of athletic equipment I need
_ money that is not forthcoming from a central authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Watnick, the girls' track coach at South Shore High School
in Brooklyn, questioned the wisdom of further burdening principals.
The new plan will not work, he said, because principals are already
overwhelmed by the responsibilities they have. ``How much do you
want to put on their heads?'' he asked.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   What is indisputable about the city's sports overhaul is that it
comes at the expense of the PSAL.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Board of Education task force last year concluded that the
PSAL, which administers sports programs for 165 high schools and
2,361 boys' and girls' teams, had to a great extent failed. Its
staff of eight full-time employees and its network of coaches and
athletic directors who serve as part-time commissioners for
individual sports had been overwhelmed, the report said, by the
sharp growth in the number of high schools in the 1990's and the
explosion of girls' teams that the city was forced by federal law
to create in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The PSAL's new role is more consultant than administrator. It
will schedule games between schools, arrange for officials and
umpires and offer advice about rules and procedures when asked.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison with the PSAL's original mission and historic role
in the school system, such a diminished role falls just short of
extinction. In the century's early decades, when New York City's
system of high school sports and physical education was being
built, and being seen as a national model, the agency was a central
_ sometimes autocratic _ voice and authority and advocate for the
value and necessity of school sports. In the name of greater local
control, that unifying voice, however much it already had been
eclipsed, has been silenced.
</P>
<P>
   But many principals also fear that downsizing the PSAL, whatever
the result for students, will make sports more political in New
York by injecting the issue directly into one of the most divisive
subjects in public education: tenure for principals. The Board of
Education and Giuliani are leading vehement campaigns to chip away
at or eliminate tenure for principals.
</P>
<P>
   Greater local control has raised the specter, some principals
say, of a kind of Trojan horse _ a huge extra task, cast as an
improvement, that principals cannot possibly keep up with, given
all their other duties. The new rule book could come back to haunt
them, they say, as a prosecutorial exhibit with the first major
scandal of poor enforcement or student injury.
</P>
<P>
   The principals' union, for its part, sees little change in the
status quo. Sports will be made better, union officials say,
because principals are more capable and competent than PSAL
staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Crew, the city's schools chancellor, said he believed that
spending increases for sports in the last few years _ and his own
statements of commitment _ had changed the debate: The question is
no longer survival, he said, but rather how to create the proper
role for sports going forward. Crew said in an interview that
athletics must become part of a broader educational effort aimed at
putting students onto what he calls a ``road of personal
competency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would argue that there are many ways of being able to scale
to that road,'' he said. ``And I have not chosen one over the other
_ I'm saying all three have to be present.''
</P>
<P>
   Many principals say they are optimistic about the changes at the
PSAL mainly because they say the administration of sports could not
get much worse.
</P>
<P>
   At Liberty High School, for example, which has only three sports
teams _ boys' and girls' volleyball and coed bowling _ Schnur, the
principal, said that his new responsibilities had resulted in
changes already. Students who want to use the gym after school must
now provide proof that they have had a physical examination. That
rule, he said, has probably been on the books for years, if not
decades, but in the hands of the PSAL, it was never enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was essential that it be changed,'' said Eileen Taylor, the
principal at Aviation High School in Queens and an enthusiastic
supporter of the overhaul. ``More accountability is built in, and
it's more realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Most school officials, though, said that keeping sports going in
New York _ no matter what changes are made in the name of reform _
had become a matter of faith. Either you believe that it can be
done, they said, or you don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grit our teeth and find a way,'' said Wanda Nix, the
athletic director at Townsend Harris High School in Queens. ``I
think there are answers. I think they're out there somewhere.''

US PROBING HARVARD-SPONSORED PROGRAM

<P>
   Federal prosecutors are conducting a criminal and civil
investigation into whether officials of a Harvard
University-sponsored effort to help Russia reconstruct its economy
profited from inside market knowledge, according to Harvard and US
government sources.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Harvard convenes top US and Russian business and
political leaders Friday for a two-day symposium on Russia's
economy and investments, the university is in the awkward position
of answering questions from federal investigators about the Harvard
Institute for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   The office of US Attorney Donald K. Stern is conducting the
investigation of the institute officials, who were operating under
a US government grant while they were helping Russia adapt to
capitalism. Both Harvard and US government sources in Washington
confirmed the existence of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, institute officials who played a key role in Russia's
economic reconstruction, including a distinguished Harvard
economist, were not even invited to speak at a conference that will
discuss Russian investment opportunties and mull over the fruits of
their work.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources familiar with the probe, the investigators
are trying to determine if the principals _ renowned Harvard
economics Professor Andrei Shleifer and Jonathan Hay _ violated
federal law during the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the sources said, the investigators are focusing
on whether Shleifer and Hay profited from investments made by
Shleifer's wife and Hay's girlfriend into Russia's stock market
while the institute was being paid $43 million by the US government
to advise Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his economic chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Graham Allison, director of the center at the John F. Kennedy
School of Government at Harvard, which is sponsoring the symposium,
said that considering the institute's major involvement in
transforming the Russian economy, it was reasonable to ask why
neither Shleifer nor anyone else from the institute was
participating as a moderator or panel member.
</P>
<P>
   But, Allison insisted, the reason had nothing to do with the
negative publicity that ensued from disclosures over the alleged
conflicts of interest involving Shleifer and Hay.
</P>
<P>
   Although Shleifer and Jeffrey Sachs, director of the institute,
were among about 20 Harvard professors with expertise in Russia
invited to attend the symposium, he said neither man has been
invited to speak or moderate because the sessions are focusing on
current investment opportunities and challenges.
</P>
<P>
   However, another Russian scholar at Harvard said that while
Shleifer's reputation remains intact at Harvard, his appearance as
a moderator or panel member would have raised eyebrows because of
the controversy. ``He's hot merchandise right now,'' said the
Harvard professor, who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs, who was unaware of the alleged profiteering, has not been
implicated in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators working on the case, including assistant US
Attorney Sarah M. Bloom, have spoken frequently in recent months
with lawyers and other officials at Harvard University and have
sought volumes of documents from the Harvard Institute for
International Development about its work with the Russian
government. The institute's rules specifically prohibit its
employees or members of their families from investing in the
country they are advising.
</P>
<P>
   Stern refused to discuss the investigation Thursday. But its
priority was underscored by a Justice Department letter last June
asking the chairman of the House Committee on International
Relations to defer a congressional review of the institute's
activity. Such a review would interfere with a ``pending criminal
and civil investigation by the United States Attorney's office for
the District of Massachusetts,'' according to the letter to
Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, a New York Republican.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging the existence of the investigation, Earl H.
Nemser of New York, Shleifer's lawyer, said his client was not
being targeted in the probe. ``My understanding is that it does not
involve Mr. Shleifer,'' Nemser said Wednesday. Thursday, Nemser
declined to answer further questions, including whether he
represented Shleifer's wife, Nancy Zimmerman, in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Although they could not be reached this week, Zimmerman, Hay _
who is no longer associated with Harvard _ and his girlfriend,
Elizabeth Hebert, have all previously denied they engaged in any
conflicts of interest by investing in Russian markets.
</P>
<P>
   However, an investigation by the US Agency for International
Development, which funded the $43 million contract, found that
Shleifer and Hay had ``gained influence'' over Russian capital
markets they were helping to set up, and had ``abused the trust of
the United States government by using personal relationships . . .
for private gain.'' Among the allegations: Hay invested in Russian
government securities while advising the Yeltsin government on
capital markets; and helped Hebert establish a Russian mutual fund,
the first allowed to sell such funds to the Russian public.
</P>
<P>
   A second charge, that Hay directed a second center he and the
institute established with USAID funds to assist Zimmerman in her
Russian investments, was determined to be unfounded by a World Bank
audit. But the damage was already done: In May 1997, AID canceled
its contract with the Harvard institute, cutting off the final $14
million installment of a $57 million grant.

SENATORS VISIBLY CHALLENGED BY THE REQUIREMENT OF SILENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan signaled an aide
for water. Senator Paul Wellstone stood to stretch his back.
Senator Rick Santorum yawned slightly, and Senator Fred Thompson
leaned back in his seat, gazing up at the eagle insignia carved
into the ceiling dome.
</P>
<P>
   That was hour one.
</P>
<P>
   By hour four, the 100 members of the US Senate were clearly
squirming for a break from the opening statements of the
impeachment trial against President Clinton. The rules, in a
departure from normal Senate protocol, forbid them from speaking
during the trial proceedings ``under pain of imprisonment.'' But by
5 p.m., the pain of silence seemed worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting a little bit tired,'' sighed Senator Robert C.
Byrd, a Democrat from West Virginia, ambling into his side office
during a late afternoon break.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is, your eyelids begin to take over,'' said
Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democrat from New Jersey, as he
ducked into the Senate cafeteria to buy some Peppermint Patties.
``It's hard to sit there silently and listen. A senator's function
is usually based on having to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   On an afternoon described as ``grave,'' ``solemn'' and
``historic,'' these new rules of decorum _ silence, obedience, and
respect _ lent the Senate chamber a peculiar air Thursday
afternoon, as the House ``managers'' launched their case against
Clinton in their first six hours of opening statements.
</P>
<P>
   These rules also signaled what may be the greatest challenge for
both the prosecution and the defense: keeping all 100 senators
riveted, or at least awake, for the remaining three dozen or so
hours of opening remarks, without letting them interject their
opinions. Depending on how the trial proceeds, it may be weeks
before any senator can talk in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being silent is going to be very difficult,'' said Senator
Slade Gorton, a Republican from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 1 p.m., senators filed in, one by one, taking
their seats on both sides of the aisle. It was, several said, a
strange sensation. In the normal process of legislating, the full
Senate rarely gathers at once, and certainly never for such long
stretches of time. Even when a vote is being taken, senators ``come
in, they mill around, they stand in the well and talk,'' said
Richard A. Baker, the Senate historian.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really extraordinary,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the common occurence on the Senate floor,'' agreed
Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island. ``It's not
something we would do ordinarily. But it's something we have to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   They tried to appear attentive. Indeed, several said they had
actually read an official decorum memo circulated by Senator Susan
M. Collins, Republican of Maine, which pleaded with senators to
help ``lend the greatest dignity to these proceedings,'' and to
``reflect the civility of the Senate.'' And later, at least one
sworn juror, Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri, brushed aside
skepticism about the Senate's collective attention span.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to school for about 20 years, and most of the time I
was quiet and took notes,'' Ashcroft said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ashcroft was among the first to cut out of the Senate
chamber during a break _ to the men's room, where he was joined by
several senators with less patience for the proceedings. Senator
Max Cleland, a Democrat from Georgia, said he was ``thankful for
the 15-minute recess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we'd be in there for hours,'' Cleland said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, there were moments of diversion. A cell phone rang from
the public gallery. Tourists, who were lined up in the freezing
rain to catch a glimpse of the proceeding, rotated in and out of
the public seats, whispering and occasionally pointing to the
senators below. The press gallery drew its share of attention, too,
as former White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers took a seat near
the New York columnist Jimmy Breslin.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist also warned senators of
another potential distraction: He would ``need to stand on
occasion'' to stretch his back, part of his routine while presiding
over the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   But none of it was captivating enough for David Kendall, a White
House lawyer, who dropped his head and yawned almost immediately
after taking his seat at the defense table. Later on, Senator Jesse
Helms's eyelids drooped. Senator Ted Stevens, a Republican from
Alaska, even appeared to doze off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking antibiotics,'' he said later. ``It's tougher than
hell to stay awake.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening arguments ended promptly, just after 7 p.m. Senators
scrambled to close their notebooks, gathering their briefcases and
heading for the doors. Suddenly, as they burst into the hallways,
they seemed to exude energy and vibrance _ especially, it seemed,
as they shared their opinions with reporters on the events of the
first day.
</P>
<P>
   Only one senator seemed to have something to look forward to:
Senator John B. Breaux, a Democrat from Louisiana, who will be
hosting 2,000 constituents in town over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be challenged to prove we can be serious and
have a good time at the same time,'' he said.

 Boeing still has problems with new planes  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE -- More than six miles high, the British Airways 747 was
winging its way from Sydney to Bangkok when the pilot and copilot
detected a burning smell on the flight deck, and several warning
messages appeared on a crew alert system.
</P>
<P>
   Such ominous signs that something may be burning are taken very
seriously on jetliners these days, especially after last
September's crash off Nova Scotia of Swissair Flight 111. All 229
people aboard that Boeing MD-11 died when the plane plunged into
the sea 16 minutes after the pilots first reported smoke in the
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   In the case two months later of the British Airways 747, the
plane landed safely in Bangkok. There was no fire, but maintenance
crews did find a broken and burned circuit breaker. A
just-completed investigation by The Boeing Co. determined that a
piece of debris inadvertently left in a power distribution panel on
the jumbo jet during its assembly in Everett eventually caused an
electrical short circuit.
</P>
<P>
   That incident, and many more, are detailed in a recent batch of
reports about defects airlines are finding with new Boeing planes.
Although Boeing says post-delivery defects are declining, there are
still problems. On some of the 563 jets Boeing delivered in 1998,
parts were not properly installed or were left out, fuel tanks
leaked, door nobs fell off and new paint peeled. On a Saudi Arabian
Airlines 777, 16 rear seat track fittings were found broken on
passenger seats after the plane was delivered.
</P>
<P>
   And as with the British Airways 747, airlines also found what is
known as foreign object debris in their new planes. A Boeing
flashlight was even found in the wing aileron of a new 767.
</P>
<P>
   The documents obtained by the Post-Intelligencer cover problems
with Boeing widebody jets built in Everett -- the 747, 777 and 767.
</P>
<P>
   The reports are considered proprietary by Boeing and are never
made public but were given to the P-I by a source.
</P>
<P>
   During a year-end delivery ceremony at Boeing Field on Dec. 30,
Boeing Commercial Airplanes President Alan Mulally boasted to
reporters that the record number of jetliners delivered to
customers in 1998 were among the finest ever built by Boeing.
Mulally's comment was in response to a question whether the quality
of Boeing planes had suffered as a result of the company's all-out
push to get a record number of airplanes out factory doors in 1998
to meet delivery schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing tracks defects found in its airplanes before they leave
the factory, as well as defects found by customers after delivery.
Both pre-delivery and post-delivery defects are down, said Deborah
Limb, a Boeing vice president and director of customer quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at our quality measures, we are improving,''
Limb said in an interview Thursday. ``I'm also hearing from our
customers that we are improving.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, airlines are finding careless and shoddy workmanship on
their new planes, according to the documents obtained by the
Post-Intelligencer. Among the post-delivery defects cited in the
documents:
</P>
<P>
   -A fuel leak was reported in the center wing tank of a 747
delivered to British Airways in March. The tank had the original
Boeing inspection seal intact, indicating it had not been entered
since delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The operator noted that the tank sealant was sloppy and of
extremely poor quality,'' said one document.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the area of the external leakage, they (British Airways)
reported there was a blob of sealant that was contaminated with
metal chips. ... Additionally, various areas of sealant were of
different colors and appeared to be improperly cured and crumbly in
consistency. They also noted that there was a leak in a tee-fitting
in the roof of the tank due to a cut O-ring.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane in question was the 1,149th jumbo jet to come down
Boeing's production line in Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The previous 747 on the assembly line also was delivered to
British Airways in March. It, too, had a leak in the center fuel
tank.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways requested that Boeing furnish a fuel tank
sealing expert to locate and repair the fuel leaks in both new
747s.
</P>
<P>
   -A 747 freighter delivered to Atlas airlines in July also had a
leaky center fuel tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``After fuel tank entry, 20 inches of sealant were found missing
... '' according to a Boeing document. Atlas also reported that the
scavenge fuel line in the tank was not connected.
</P>
<P>
   -When Delta Airlines mechanics checked a strut leak on a 767
delivered in March, they discovered missing seals.
</P>
<P>
   -Galley ducting was missing from a Quantas 767 delivered in
July. ``The operator reported warm air exhausting from the cabin
sidewall ... . The operator noted that none of the parts for the
installation can be located on the airplane, including the support
bracketry.''
</P>
<P>
   -The cockpit crew restroom door nob fell off a United Airlines
747 shortly after it was delivered in July.
</P>
<P>
   -A damaged panel under the left wing was found on a 767
delivered to Delta Airlines in October.
</P>
<P>
   -Asiana Airlines said paint peeled off the engine fan cowlings
of a 767 delivered in July, exposing the white paint underneath.
Paint was also peeling away from numerous rivets and fuselage
joints.
</P>
<P>
   -Air France complained about sloppy installation of insulation
fuselage blankets on a 777 delivered in April. The blankets did not
overlap and caused ``a sweating condition at the cabin sidewall
interior.''
</P>
<P>
   -Saudi Arabian Airlines found 16 rear seat track fittings broken
on the passenger seats of a 777 delivered in February.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing investigation determined the seat track fittings may
have been torqued beyond engineering specifications.
</P>
<P>
   -In November, a Boeing flashlight was found lodged in the left
aileron of a 767 delivered to United Parcel Service. The aileron is
a critical flight control surface on the trailing edge of a wing.
The flashlight had caused ``slight damage.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem of foreign objects is considered so serious that
Boeing's Everett factory is in the process of implementing a new
policy that will require workers to check out their tools at the
start of each shift, and check them back in.
</P>
<P>
   As Boeing attempted to ramp up production to record levels in
1997, the company said out-of-sequence work contributed to many of
its production problems that continued well into last year.

<P>
   Indeed, institute officials who played a key role in Russia's
economic reconstruction, including a distinguished Harvard
economist, were not even invited to speak at a conference that will
discuss Russian investment opportunties and mull over the fruits of
their work.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources familiar with the probe, the investigators
are trying to determine if the principals _ renowned Harvard
economics Professor Andrei Shleifer and Jonathan Hay _ violated
federal law during the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the sources said, the investigators are focusing
on whether Shleifer and Hay profited from investments made by
Shleifer's wife and Hay's girlfriend into Russia's stock market
while the institute was being paid $43 million by the US government
to advise Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his economic chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Graham Allison, director of the center at the John F. Kennedy
School of Government at Harvard, which is sponsoring the symposium,
said that considering the institute's major involvement in
transforming the Russian economy, it was reasonable to ask why
neither Shleifer nor anyone else from the institute was
participating as a moderator or panel member.
</P>
<P>
   But, Allison insisted, the reason had nothing to do with the
negative publicity that ensued from disclosures over the alleged
conflicts of interest involving Shleifer and Hay.
</P>
<P>
   Although Shleifer and Jeffrey Sachs, director of the institute,
were among about 20 Harvard professors with expertise in Russia
invited to attend the symposium, he said neither man has been
invited to speak or moderate because the sessions are focusing on
current investment opportunities and challenges.
</P>
<P>
   However, another Russian scholar at Harvard said that while
Shleifer's reputation remains intact at Harvard, his appearance as
a moderator or panel member would have raised eyebrows because of
the controversy. ``He's hot merchandise right now,'' said the
Harvard professor, who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs, who was unaware of the alleged profiteering, has not been
implicated in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators working on the case, including assistant US
Attorney Sarah M. Bloom, have spoken frequently in recent months
with lawyers and other officials at Harvard University and have
sought volumes of documents from the Harvard Institute for
International Development about its work with the Russian
government. The institute's rules specifically prohibit its
employees or members of their families from investing in the
country they are advising.
</P>
<P>
   Stern refused to discuss the investigation Thursday. But its
priority was underscored by a Justice Department letter last June
asking the chairman of the House Committee on International
Relations to defer a congressional review of the institute's
activity. Such a review would interfere with a ``pending criminal
and civil investigation by the United States Attorney's office for
the District of Massachusetts,'' according to the letter to
Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, a New York Republican.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging the existence of the investigation, Earl H.
Nemser of New York, Shleifer's lawyer, said his client was not
being targeted in the probe. ``My understanding is that it does not
involve Mr. Shleifer,'' Nemser said Wednesday. Thursday, Nemser
declined to answer further questions, including whether he
represented Shleifer's wife, Nancy Zimmerman, in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Although they could not be reached this week, Zimmerman, Hay _
who is no longer associated with Harvard _ and his girlfriend,
Elizabeth Hebert, have all previously denied they engaged in any
conflicts of interest by investing in Russian markets.
</P>
<P>
   However, an investigation by the US Agency for International
Development, which funded the $43 million contract, found that
Shleifer and Hay had ``gained influence'' over Russian capital
markets they were helping to set up, and had ``abused the trust of
the United States government by using personal relationships . . .
for private gain.'' Among the allegations: Hay invested in Russian
government securities while advising the Yeltsin government on
capital markets; and helped Hebert establish a Russian mutual fund,
the first allowed to sell such funds to the Russian public.
</P>
<P>
   A second charge, that Hay directed a second center he and the
institute established with USAID funds to assist Zimmerman in her
Russian investments, was determined to be unfounded by a World Bank
audit. But the damage was already done: In May 1997, AID canceled
its contract with the Harvard institute, cutting off the final $14
million installment of a $57 million grant.

WHAT'S ON TYSON'S MIND? IT'S ANYBODY'S GUESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Not so many months ago, six of the country's most
respected psychiatrists and psychologists studied Mike Tyson and
concluded he was as sane as they are. Several days ago, Tyson
called them Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder what they're thinking this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way those doctors I coexisted with (during a week
of testing and evaluations last fall at Massachusetts General
Hospital in Boston) could be sane,'' Tyson said of the Six Wise Men
who told the Nevada State Athletic Commission he was mentally fit
to fight and thus greatly helped get his revoked license to box
reinstated 19 months after he was banned for twice biting the ears
of Evander Holyfield. ``They love to torture some people's minds.
They'd have been great Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Peirce, a spokeswoman for Mass. General, said Thursday
the four MGH doctors who examined Tyson _ David Medoff, David
Henderson, Thomas Deters, and Jeremy Schmahmann _ did not want to
respond to Tyson's assessment. ``It would be inappropriate for
physicians to comment on any patient, past or present,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Henderson was reached at the Freedom Trail Clinic in
Government Center and was apprised of the remarks. After asking for
them to be repeated, he said, ``This was reported in some paper or
something? No response. None at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached at home, Medoff said, ``I'm sorry to hear he's thinking
that way or talking that way. And other than that, I don't feel it
would be appropriate to respond in any other way.''
</P>
<P>
   After having given Tyson clearance to engage in one of the most
stressful events in sports _ prizefighting _ Henderson, Medoff,
Deters, and Schmahmann probably did the wise thing. But they could
not be elated to hear Tyson's assessment of their mental health,
one can be sure. Yet after hearing their assessment of his mental
health, Tyson seemed to dispute even their learned opinion earlier
this week when he told a small group of acquaintances, ``We're all
creatures of contradiction. I was really screwed up before _ and
that was just a few days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   If this guy is as sane as the rest of us, the world's in a lot
of trouble. If he isn't, the boxing world could be.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night Tyson returns to the ring to face a white South
African heavyweight of little note, Francois Botha. Botha is a
former International Boxing Federation champion, but these days
such titles carry far less significance, so it seems he is little
more than a tough guy with a strong chin. Unfortunately for him,
his chin is far more imposing than his fists, which should make for
a short night for Tyson unless . . . unless . . . unless Tyson
provides a need for the extra police who have been put on alert
because of the riot that developed after his last appearance at the
MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
   That was June 28, 1997, when the Bite of the Century landed
Tyson out of boxing and then into an evaluation at Mass. General
before he was allowed to resume plying his concussive trade. Now
he's back, as odd and outwardly arrogant as ever, although so much
of his bluster seems forced and phony these days that no one is
completely sure anymore that he is not someone T.S. Eliot already
wrote about _ The Hollow Man.
</P>
<P>
   For example, more than 6,000 seats remain unsold for the fight,
while Madison Square Garden is approaching a sellout already for
its March 13 unification fight between Holyfield and World Boxing
Council champion Lennox Lewis. Yet Tyson said, ``Yeah, I lost to
Holyfield. Yeah, I bit his (expletive) ear. He and Lennox Lewis are
outstanding fighters, but they aren't Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys talk about me like a god. Muhammad Ali set the
stage, but there's never been a fighter as big as Mike Tyson. I'm
champion when I'm not champion. When they're the champion, I'm the
(expletive) king. Look at the gate receipts. They can't make any
money without me.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting, what, $20 million and $10 million for a title
fight? Listen, I'm making $35 million for fighting a 10-rounder. It
doesn't mean that I'm better or they're worse. What it means are
the personalities. Them guys aren't Mike Tyson. I don't care how
many tickets they sell. They're not Mike Tyson. If I fight on the
same night, those guys are out of a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was reminded that just such a situation existed in 1995
and it was he, not Holyfield, who pulled out of a fight with Buster
Mathis Jr. Tyson claimed a bad thumb was the reason, though it was
widely reported that ticket sales were slow for his fight while up
the Strip a quarter-mile, Holyfield and Riddick Bowe were selling
out Caesars Palace. Told of this, Tyson said, ``Fact is, if I did
fight that night, they were going to make me fight first and they
were going to fight later. They knew nobody would come to their
fight if I was fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   To believe that, one has to suppose all those Bowe-Holyfield
tickets had been bought as souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   Such contradictions are the essence of Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   One minute he talks of wanting to be a better father, and the
next, he says he lived in Brooklyn over the summer rather than in
the Washington suburbs with his family. One minute he says he's
making $35 million for the Botha fight, and the next, the
commission says it's $10 million. One minute he says he's the box
office king, and the next, he can't sell out when Holyfield already
has. It's a good thing some of America's leading psychiatrists
announced he was sane, because otherwise, you might get the wrong
impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Jacobs and Bill Cayton (his former managers after Cus
D'Amato) should be put in jail for making me champion,'' he said.
``If this is what happiness is all about, I could do with a lot
less. I can't remember the last time everything was great. I was
the scourge of Brooklyn. The scourge of every part of society. I
been much lower than anyone ever been. I been to the bottom, came
up, fell down again, and came back. The difference is I know how to
get back again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is going to be Mike. You can keep your tennis shoe deals.
Your little toy deals. You can keep it. I'll curse. I'll be crass
and obnoxious.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say no one is planning an ``If I could be like
Mike'' ad remake for Tyson, especially not after a midweek
satellite interview in which he cursed out radio personality Russ
Salzberg of WFAN in New York and another reporter live and in
living color (blue), then was dismissive and mocking to two other
reporters who were interviewing him for the purpose of helping sell
the pay-per-view event at a healthy $49.95 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   This endless self-pity Tyson has chosen to wallow in for most of
his professional life has grown tiresome to many who have been
around him from the start. His problems are always someone else's
creation. His failings are always understandable if only you were
in his shoes. His worst moments are always ``Mike being Mike,'' and
his best are always signs of a new Mike.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nothing really changes for Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he was before, he is surrounded by a small army of
enablers who explain away these explosions. They say he's tense, as
if Botha is less tense knowing he's 24 hours from unconsciousness.
They say he has problems, citing a hearing in Maryland on an
assault charge that could result in his parole being revoked
following his prison sentence for rape, as if that was anyone's
fault but his own. They say he's under financial pressures because
he owes the IRS $13 million, as if you should feel sorry for a guy
who made $150 million and found a way to blow it all.
</P>
<P>
   Always, there is someone else to blame. It was his background as
a kid or his experience in reform school or too much success too
soon after he became the youngest heavyweight champion in history.
It was his life or his wife, a fishbowl existence or a jail cell
existence or Don King's existence. It was always something. It was
even Holyfield's fault he got his ears bitten.
</P>
<P>
   Never, it seems, is the guy who has left 39 victims flat in his
45 victories anything but a victim himself. A victim, even, of a
group of doctors in Boston who bent over backward to find a way to
help him resume his career and had their character assassinated for
their trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Just Mike being Mike, whoever Mike is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not supposed to be here now,'' he said. ``I was supposed
to be finished after the Robin Givens (the actress who became his
first wife when he was 22) deal. After jail. After being Thorazined
out . . . what was that stuff they gave me? Yeah, lithium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the guys I fought are in oblivion now. They're
fighting to pay crack habits. I've been as low as any man could
ever be, but I'm still here. At a young age, 20, why couldn't I say
I'm the best when everybody else in the world was saying it to me?
So I adapted to that and I'd go, `Hey, I'm the best. I'm the
greatest. Don't touch me. Don't you know who I am?' I got caught up
in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a young kid. After Cus died, I attracted a lot of
people snatching and ripping and grabbing at me. I was 21 and I got
married and I got screwed up. I thought it was a fairy tale. I was
wrong. I was happy and married and had all of this going on and I
thought it was going to last forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 21, you're just a baby sheep, a lamb, a fawn in front of
the tigers and the lions. I thought I was a grown man but I was a
child, and when you look at a child, he can be obnoxious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was young and naive, and people who were older and a lot
more sophisticated and knew what was going on took advantage of me.
It took me a long time to learn about people.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what Tyson has learned about people is difficult to
determine, since he seems to continue to attract far too many who
are just there for the money. He understands this, to be sure, yet
they remain. New faces, old game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet occasionally, Tyson has a moment of clarity, a moment when
the other side of the world peeks through. Such a moment came
recently when his wife called to tell him his new accountants had
discovered a retirement fund with more than $200,000 in it that
someone had set aside for him.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was stunned until he learned who it was and how it had
been built. Then, at least for a moment, he was happy to be alive,
happy to know he had a friend. Happy, even, to be Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept wondering who left me $200,000,'' Tyson said. ``I
thought maybe it was someone I had helped a long time ago who was
giving it back to me. For me, $200,000 is truly insignificant even
if I'm doing bad. When I was living crazy, I spent $200,000 on
belts and underwear. I spent that on champagne for girls at
nightclubs. But I said to my wife, `Where did this come from?'
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife said, `Do you think Rory (Holloway, one of his
ex-managers whom he's suing) or Don King set it up?' I said, `No
(expletive) way!' When they finally told me Cus left it, for the
first time in 32 years _ you know the saying, `It's the thought
that counts'? _ well, for the first time, I finally understood
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like he did it all at once. It was $20 here and $5
there. He must have known I was going to screw up my money. They
told me I was only getting 5 percent on it and they wanted to move
it, but I told them to leave it to the year 5000. It just made me
feel a lot better that there are good people in the world. I was
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought anybody loved (me). I had to wait 32 years to
find that out. It enhances that good people are out there because
what I do for a living attracts a lot of scumbags.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes after Mike Tyson told of having his faith
restored in humanity by Cus D'Amato, he called the doctors who'd
helped him get back to work Nazis. Mike being Mike, whoever Mike
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, don't take offense,'' Tyson said as the conversation
ended. ``I'm just angry at the world. I'm dealing with a crisis in
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to tell what that crisis might be, but one thing
is sure. It's not the presence of Francois Botha in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   What you have to wonder is if the crisis could be the presence
of Mike Tyson there.

INSIDE RING, TYSON A CHANGED MAN?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ In the weeks leading up to his bout against Francois
Botha on Saturday, Mike Tyson has been what we've come to expect of
him: belligerent and self-pitying and only occasionally civil.
</P>
<P>
   That's outside the ring, where Tyson has never found peace.
</P>
<P>
   And in it?
</P>
<P>
   His new trainer, Tommy Brooks, likes what he sees _ a Tyson who
listens to him, a Tyson who wants to correct the bad boxing habits
he's developed over the past decade, a Tyson who truly wants to
fight.
</P>
<P>
   That's all Brooks can ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be responsible for Mike's actions,'' Brooks said.
``He's a grown man. I can't tell him what to do. I'm just a fight
trainer. I teach him how to fight...
</P>
<P>
   ``I (begin ital)do(end ital) know Mike's a competitor, I know
he's working hard to become champion again.''
</P>
<P>
   In his last fight, Tyson's personal demons invaded his boxing
career for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   He bit the ears of Evander Holyfield 19 months ago in the same
MGM Grand ring in which he will face Botha. Has counseling and
reflection in the meantime changed him? C'mon. He has a new, more
palatable team around him, but he's the same old person.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why people are fascinated with him, Tyson said: ``I don't
know. Maybe they hate me more than they hate anybody else. They
want to see me in demise. It makes them happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the second Holyfield fight, the ring was always a
haven for Tyson. Within the roped confines he got the respect he
didn't get elsewhere. He had a purpose, a mission to beat the other
guy. It was a legal outlet for his rage and gave him the means to
make tons of money.
</P>
<P>
   With the biting incident and his punishment behind him, Tyson
has dived back into what he knows best.
</P>
<P>
   His principal motivation these days is the money. He said he
wants to fight four times this year and then call it quits, however
unlikely that might seem. The plan is to fight Holyfield a third
time in November or December in what could be a $100 million
matchup.
</P>
<P>
   That's incentive we can all relate to. The money should help him
square some of his reported financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   For Brooks, it doesn't matter what drives his fighter as long as
he's driven. And Tyson, he insists, is driven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was under the impression I would get a spoiled,
self-centered kid who cared about no one but himself. In fact, he's
been a real sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in camp says one thing, but I see something
different. He's either treating me differently or he has a serious
scam going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who worked with Holyfield and was in his corner in June,
paints Tyson as a hungry and disciplined fighter eager to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks must mold Tyson, 32, back into the fighter who became the
youngest heavyweight champion in history. So far, Tyson's been
cooperating. That contrasts with his past when he battled his
handlers as vociferously as his sparring partners.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks deserves much of the credit.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson likes and respects him. The former champion wanted someone
who wouldn't be afraid to push him hard, which earlier handlers,
his infamous ``yes men,'' failed to do.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks told the story of the day in camp when Tyson vomited
during sparring.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Tyson, a pro since 1985, figured it was time for a
break. Brooks figured otherwise. He reasoned that a fighter
couldn't quit if he became ill during an actual bout _ so Tyson
continued to spar.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks doesn't have to push too hard, though.
</P>
<P>
   He also told the story of when Tyson was sparring and Brooks put
a temporary halt to the action. Brooks was pleased with Tyson's
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He yelled, `Why are you stopping the workout? I was just
getting ready to get to him!''' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see from the gym workouts, the desire to be in there, to
ask a lot of questions in the gym and at home that he wants to
fight, he wants to be prepared to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the two sides of the man: Tyson the social misfit and
Tyson the boxer. Once, on that June night in 1996, the two sides
intersected and it was ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't Brooks worried that it could happen again? He says no,
that Tyson snapped because he was out of shape and without a game
plan and getting the you-know-what beaten out of him.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks doesn't like to talk about Tyson the man. However, he did
offer this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's a good person. He just needs guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad Brooks can't be with him 24 hours a day, 365 days a
year.

PEN AND PAPER HELP HEAL THESE WOUNDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's a book Kings forward Dan Bylsma and his
wife Mary Beth have set aside for their newborn son Bryan, and it's
not ``So Your Son Wants To Play In The NHL,'' the guide to sports
and life that Dan and his dad Jay co-wrote.
</P>
<P>
   That book, published last fall, is in its second printing. The
book young Bryan Bylsma will one day read isn't destined for any
bestseller's list, though the words are so powerful they'd surely
knock Oprah out. It was written for a very select audience, though
the underlying theme is universal.
</P>
<P>
   Only Bryan and any siblings that follow him will read about the
baby whose heart inexplicably stopped beating a few days before her
due date and almost a year before Bryan's birth on Jan. 3. The
little girl was delivered and immediately designated an angel.
</P>
<P>
   That's the name that graced the hospital paperwork and it is how
the Bylsmas referred to their firstborn in the pages of the journal
they kept for the duration of Mary Beth's second pregnancy, which
had both Bylsmas on (diaper) pins and (amniocenthesis) needles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an emotional pregnancy for us,'' said Bylsma, a reserve
winger who has skated 11 shifts in the new year. He was a healthy
scratch Thursday night when the Kings entertained Calgary at the
Forum. ``The last few months were especially tough. You want to
believe you're going to hold a healthy baby in your hands but at
the same time you know it might not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke Dan Bylsma was standing in a corner of the Forum,
fingering a gift bag for Bryan that someone had just handed him.
Two weeks earlier, he would have been reluctant to accept any
presents, for fear of jinxing the birth.
</P>
<P>
   For the same reason, Mary Beth refused to hold a baby shower
late in the pregnancy as she had done the first time. She didn't
want to risk the heartbreak of having to return _ or worse yet,
keep _ any presents.
</P>
<P>
   The fears Dan and Mary Beth didn't dare express except in the
pages of the journal manifested themselves in myriad other ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had gotten the crib and the bouncy chair out the first
time,'' Bylsma said. ``This time we didn't do any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's funny, Dan's father said last week with a sad smile that
signified he was about to tell one of life's cruel jokes. When Dan
descended on the hospital waiting room to deliver the news about
Bryan, he was crying and the words got caught in his throat, just
like the first time, one year ago today. Jan. 15, 1998 is a date
that forever will be etched in the Bylsmas' hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emotions of joy and grief are are almost the same,'' said
Jay, who flew out for Bryan's birth and returned home to Michigan
the day after the Kings' 1-1 home tie last Saturday against
Edmonton. ``It's just your heart that feels different.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bylsma's heart has never felt lighter or heavier than it
does on what would have been his firstborn's first birthday. Every
time he looks at his son he sees the future and the past and feels
hope and hurt and adoration and angst.
</P>
<P>
   After their daughter was born, the Bylsmas held her for a few
minutes and took some photographs. When Dan gazes at Bryan, it's as
if he's looking at those pictures. ``It's very clear they were
brother and sister,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well-meaning people have told the Bylsmas how lucky they are to
have been able to supplant the memory of the baby girl they lost
with a healthy baby boy, as though children were as interchangeable
as journeyman forwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about that a lot before we decided to get pregnant
again,'' Bylsma said. ``We didn't want to get pregnant to replace
what we lost. We wanted to get pregnant to give a baby the love it
deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   The last trimester dragged on like a fight-filled third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would put my hand on her belly in the morning and wait for
the baby to kick,'' Bylsma said, ``and when he did we knew we could
start our day.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dan went to the rink, he'd return home and practically
whisper to Mary Beth, ``How are you doing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I was really asking was if the baby was still moving,''
Bylsma said. ``I knew I was asking that and she knew I was asking
that but neither of us could say it out loud.''
</P>
<P>
   The journal was their bridge over troubled feelings. They filled
100 pages, articulating things they found difficult to verbalize.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few passages with negative thoughts,'' Bylsma
said. ``Not all of it is positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The book Dan wrote with Jay is a celebration of sport but also
of family. To read it is to learn more about parenting than how to
raise a professional athlete. The Bylsmas finished writing it
before the birth of Dan and Mary Beth's first child. Dan had
mentioned his impending fatherhood in a few of the book's passages,
which made for some uncomfortable reading when the galleys came
back for editing a few months after the stillbirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really address the situation for a while,'' said
Bylsma, 28, who ultimately decided to keep the references to the
pregnancy in the book. He even penned an epilogue to explain what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met our daughter, held her and no one else did,'' Bylsma
said. ``This was a chance for us to honor the few moments we had to
spend with her.''
</P>
<P>
   That, and the journal, should tell Bryan all he needs to know
about life and love. &QL;

CLINTON TO PROPOSE 55 CENT TAX INCREASE ON PACK OF CIGARETTES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to delete 11th and 12th grafs and replace them with three new
grafs.)   (sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration plans to propose a
federal tax increase of 55 cents a pack on cigarettes to help pay
for new domestic and military spending programs, White House and
congressional officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The new tax, if enacted, would raise $8 billion a year over the
next five years and would be used to help pay for a host of new
social initiatives the president has announced over the past two
weeks, including expanded after-school programs, support for
disabled workers, hiring of new police officers and a tax credit
for people requiring long-term medical care. The money would also
help offset $100 billion in proposed new Pentagon spending over the
next six years.
</P>
<P>
   The president has not announced how he intends to pay for these
programs, promising that the details would be provided in the
budget he submits to Congress on Feb. 1. But the White House has
long signaled its intention to seek more money from tobacco, and
officials confirmed a report in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday
that Clinton will propose the tobacco tax, which is now at 24
cents, as part of a package of tax increases and loophole-closings
that it intends to push to pay for new programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to discuss in the State of the Union address next
week his administration's efforts to reduce smoking by teenagers,
including the proposed tax increase to make cigarettes too
expensive for some potential smokers.
</P>
<P>
   But the money to be raised by the new levy would not be
designated solely for anti-smoking programs, but rather to pay for
a range of social initiatives, a senior White House official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is attempting to tap the deep pockets of the American
tobacco industry for the second time in a year. In last year's
budget, the president assumed that the federal government would
collect $65 billion over five years from a proposed national legal
settlement with the tobacco industry. But after an expensive
lobbying campaign by the cigarette makers, the national pact died
in the Senate and the administration realized none of the
anticipated revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The administration hopes to claim some of the $206 billion the
industry agreed late last year to pay 46 states to settle dozens of
outstanding lawsuits filed by the states seeking reimbursement for
health-care costs caused by smoking. Officials are considering
withholding a portion of state Medicaid reimbursements to recoup
part of the federal share of the expenses of smoking-related
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette companies raised prices by 45 cents a pack to pay for
the settlement with the states, driving the price of cigarettes
over $3 a pack in most markets. The administration's 55-cent
increase would be in addition to the industry's price increase and
would more than double the federal tax on cigarettes, which is
already scheduled to rise to 39 cents a pack in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee,
reacted skeptically to the administration proposal, saying it was a
part of a pattern of taxing and spending that was likely to meet
strong opposition on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said the president should cut spending in other
programs to pay for his new programs. ``Why does everything have to
be a tax hike?'' Fleischer said. ``Members of Congress on both
sides of the aisle will be troubled by how much of his budget
relies on tax and spend.''
</P>
<P>
   An industry spokesman said the tobacco companies would
vigorously contest the tobacco increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal government economic terrorism of the industry has to
stop,'' said Scott Williams, a spokesman for the tobacco companies.
``The industry will oppose a more than doubling of the federal
excise tax on a legal consumer product in one fell swoop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As we all know, that $8 billion will fall primarily on lower-
and middle-income Americans,'' Williams said. ``The proposal is
also an affront to people on both sides who have tried to bring a
resolution to these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The states are also likely to object to an attempt to claim any
of the money they won from the tobacco companies, saying that the
federal government had no role in the litigation that led to the
settlement. They also are expected to argue that while $206 billion
sounds like a large sum, a substantial portion of the proceeds will
pay attorneys' fees and the remainder will not cover all the
health-care costs of treating tobacco-related illnesses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The White House still hopes to enact federal tobacco legislation
that would strengthen regulation of cigarettes while also raising
money to pay for anti-smoking campaigns, particularly those aimed
at teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials worked for a year on such
legislation, modeled on a plan negotiated by the states and the
tobacco industry, before conceding defeat last June. Clinton is
expected to renew his call for federal action against smoking in
the State of the Union, a White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite growing federal budget surpluses _ Clinton announced
earlier this month that the government would take in at least $76
billion more than it spends this year _ the administration has been
forced to scramble to come up with money to pay for a long list of
initiatives that it will include in the budget proposal it will
send to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the administration is the victim of its own success in
insisting that Congress leave the surplus untouched until the two
parties agree on a plan to shore up the Social Security system.
Moreover, both Congress and the administration remain bound by
budget rules that presumed the government would always run
deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Those rules impose tight spending caps and require that any tax
cuts or credits be offset by corresponding tax increases. The
spending caps for next year are about $30 billion less than
Congress would need to pay for all current programs _ never mind
any new ones _ and politically palatable sources of new revenue are
scarce.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the tobacco tax, Clinton plans to include a
number of other proposals to close corporate tax loopholes or
otherwise squeeze more revenue from the tax system, even though
Republicans routinely denounce them as dead on arrival.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the proposals allow Clinton to say he is
submitting a balanced budget that sets out his policy agenda.

STORM CREATES NEW PROBLEMS WITH FOURTH GRADERS' EXAM
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York State's new fourth-grade reading test limped
toward the end of a nightmarish debut Thursday, disrupted by bad
weather that closed scores of schools and by continuing questions
about distribution and security.
</P>
<P>
   Under fire from school administrators and testing experts,
Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, said he would
appoint an independent panel to look into delivery problems that
left several schools without the exams until Tuesday afternoon,
hours after the test was supposed to begin, and into the question
of whether students in at least 250 schools had had an unfair
advantage because they might have studied advance test material.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the panel of ``respected and impartial experts in
testing'' have not yet been announced, but the investigation may
delay the release of results by a month or two, said Chris
Carpenter, a Department of Education spokesman. The results were
scheduled to be released in early April.
</P>
<P>
   Most of New York City's fourth graders finished the three-day
exam on Thursday, but many districts upstate and on Long Island had
to postpone the final installment, in which students had to read a
children's story and write a personal essay about it. Students who
missed all or part of the exam must make it up Friday or next week,
state and city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday is the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, that will
mean a delay of at least five days for some students.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Mills defended the test, which is
published by CTB/McGraw Hill. ``It is encouraging children and
teachers and schools to focus on reading and writing in ways they
never have before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the commissioner seemed to back away from his plan to use
the test to help determine which schools were failing. He had
previously said it would be used, but on Thursday he said he would
await the result of the panel's investigation before determining
whether the test should be used for such high-stakes decisions as
helping to determine the state's roster of failing schools, which
is released in November.
</P>
<P>
   One of six passages used for the first day's multiple-choice
questions appears in a reading series published by Scholastic Inc.
Two other passages on the exam are the same subject as materials in
the series, Literary Place, but were written from other sources,
Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an illustration used in a sample test appeared in
the essay portion of the actual test, though Mills said he did not
know if that was by design.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect these passages are ones they've never seen,''
said Roseanne DeFabio, assistant state commissioner for curriculum,
instruction and assessment. ``They are from children's literature.
What we want to avoid is using some so common that opinions can be
formed about them, so we don't use `Winnie the Pooh' or
`Charlotte's Web' or others like that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for making up the last portion of the test, she said she did
not envision any security breach. She said there was no reason to
change the makeup part of this exam because it was not as high
stakes a test as the Regents exam, for example, which can determine
whether a student graduates from high school.
</P>
<P>
   But some testing experts have expressed concern that some
children might have seen the material in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps you have written about it before or had some
instruction on it so your thought process about how to detangle it
may be more developed,'' said Jonathon Supovitz, who has studied
test biases as a senior researcher at the Consortium for Policy
Research at the University of Pennsylvania. ``That would get at the
content of the response, but not necessarily the form. So they
could still judge your ability to organize a paragraph and things
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Children who took the test Thrusday were divided about its
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``After it was over I felt, like, WHEW, what a relief,'' said
Benjamin Ferraioli, a 9-year-old student at P.S. 41 in Manhattan,
as he drew his hand across his forehead to make the point.
</P>
<P>
   Stasia Kovolisky, a student at East Elementary School in Long
Beach and one of a few Long Islanders to take the exam, said she
was so fearful of the test, ``I almost threw up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, she said, ``It was easy, all three days.''

LAKERS DISAPPOINT HARRIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ His lips are sealed, by edict of the NBA, so Del
Harris couldn't rip his players for a nonchalant practice Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Lakers coach lectured the only people allowed to
listen: reporters. And lecture he did, apparently in the hope his
team reads the morning paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to see them there working together... but all in
all, I was disappointed with the effort,'' Harris said after
observing voluntary workouts at L.A. Southwest College. ``I just
think we have to work an awful lot harder than they were working in
order to get ourselves ready to play by Feb. 5.''
</P>
<P>
   NBA teams have been practicing informally since Monday, and the
league has lifted its ban on team officials observing sessions. But
they still can't talk to players.
</P>
<P>
   So Harris and his assistant coaches stood, perched 30 feet above
the court, silent and frustrated, unable to unzip their lips.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal and most of the Lakers roster
played a series of fullcourt games down below, aware of their
coaches' presence, but not their ire.
</P>
<P>
   Joked Bryant, ``I'm surprised Del didn't say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Only because the coach was biting his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh boy, I wanted to yell a lot of things,'' Harris said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Training camps will open as soon as Tuesday, and none too soon
for Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I failed to see was evidence of a team that is pushing
one another because they're on a mission,'' he said. ``And to this
point all we've done over the last couple years is talk mission.
And this year we've gotta walk it.''
</P>
<P>
   That mission being a championship, an opportunity all the more
reachable after the retirement of Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe that's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our response to Jordan retiring is, `This makes it easy for
us,' we're dead. We've got no chance,'' Harris said. ``If that's
our response, we might as well mail it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our response is, `That's even more of an incentive now to
work as hard as we possibly can...' then we have a chance. But I'm
afraid our guys could be hearing so many voices saying, `It's you,
it's you, it's you.'''
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers are indeed the Bulls' heirs-in-waiting, they
aren't showing it yet, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should start now, where they're pushing one another
to excel even in these informal workouts, and I just didn't see
that. We have such a wonderful opportunity to be the best team, but
it has to start in the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead he saw loafing, a lack of communication on defense,
``terrible transition,'' and ``a lot of walking. In an NBA game,
there's no walking.''
</P>
<P>
   On a slightly brighter note, Harris said two or three players
``excelled,'' then offered that those players didn't do enough to
push everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I just caught them on a bad day,'' he said. But Harris
was so discouraged he probably won't return in the next few days,
preferring to wait until training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating, to tell you the truth,'' he said. ``There's
nothing I can do about it, and it's actually just made me feel
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast: Elden Campbell is presumed to be an ex-Laker as
soon as the NBA allows trades, but Harris cautioned, ``that just is
not necessarily the case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who thinks we're looking to get rid of Elden is
foolish. We have in him one of the top dozen centers in the
league,'' he said. ``Not having Elden would leave us with a
tremendous void.... I don't take his contributions lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaucho country: Whenever training camps open _ they've been
pushed back to Jan. 19, at the earliest, and could be delayed
further _ the Lakers will train at UC Santa Barbara's Robertson
Gym.

 &HT;    76th congress and Govenor Bush
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For Gov. George W. Bush, the opening week of the
76th Legislature brought with it the realities of political
give-and-take. For potential presidential candidate Bush, the week
was less than perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Bush saw a budget proposal that leaves little room for his
campaign tax-cut promises. He also heard his Senate GOP ally on
education issues, Teel Bivins, make clear that any limit on the
social promotion of children who fail the TAAS test must ultimately
be left up to local school districts _ a substantially weaker
position than the one offered as a cornerstone of Bush's
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush priorities are far from dead, but under the
unforgiving microscope now focused on the governor, perceptions
that he's backing off strongly held election-year convictions can
be risky, especially on two issues that define GOP politics: tax
cuts and education.
</P>
<P>
   In the high-powered world of presidential politics, back
peddling is a necessary skill that can cut both ways, say political
experts.
</P>
<P>
   If politicians stray too far from their stated platforms, they
can lose voters' trust. But if done skillfully, such maneuvers can
signal a politician who is willing to compromise or build consensus
to come away with at least a partial victory.
</P>
<P>
   That is what some say Bush is doing to save his two major
campaign promises _ tax cuts and his plan to halt social
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he is looking at is, it is just not possible to meet the
educational needs and sales tax cuts and business tax cuts,'' said
Bob Stein, government professor at Rice University in Houston.
``He's now learning what it's like to be the front-runner.''
</P>
<P>
   And front-runners know how to hedge their bets.
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why Bush is recasting two major campaign
promises.
</P>
<P>
   Before the session, Bush initially pushed for a $2 billion
school property tax cut proposal. He also proposed a cut to taxes
on small businesses, a tax break for companies that do research and
development and a limited sales tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Bush already has said that everyone's election campaign budget
proposals will have to be adjusted. That's because the official
estimate of state income for the next two years was lower than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Paul Sadler, D-Henderson, said instead of holding Bush to
every 't' he crossed and 'i' he dotted, political observers should
evaluate whether the principle of his proposals moves forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, he's doing exactly what he's supposed to do,''
Sadler said, adding that Bush must work with legislators to get his
ideas passed.
</P>
<P>
   But others see it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what would prompt him to take a step backward,''
Lowell J. Bethel, professor of curriculum and instruction for the
University of Texas, said of Bush's position on social promotion.
``There is no doubt he is retreating and that means lowering the
(promotion) standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Bethel liked the idea of getting tough with students by drawing
a political line in the sand, using the state achievement exam to
determine which students passed and which flunked. Such methods are
credited with improving students' performance in Chicago and
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's original plan, announced more than a year ago and highly
touted during the gubernatorial campaign, would flunk even
third-graders who did not pass the reading portion of the state
achievement exam, the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills. Fifth-
and eighth-graders likewise would fail if they flunked any portion
of the TAAS.
</P>
<P>
   His plan called for an additional $203 million to provide
remedial programs, summer school and after school help for failing
students or those in danger of flunking.
</P>
<P>
   The plan failed to win support from major school or teachers
groups, however. Even Bush's ally, the Texas Association of School
Boards, opposed it because it usurped local control. Teachers
groups disliked it because it further increased emphasis on the
TAAS, already used to grade schools, districts and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, in a pragmatic move Bush a victory in education,
the GOP governor abandoned the TAAS as the final arbiter for
promotion or failure.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bethel questions the move, Stein does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There doesn't seem to be a rationale for why he has taken that
position,'' Bethel said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Stein, ``The politics of it is if you're going to support
local control, you better support local control.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, backed by Bivins, still would require students in
certain grades to pass the TAAS to be promoted. But it now includes
what school groups call a ``safety valve,'' allowing local
districts to make the final decision about whether students who
flunk the TAAS still should be promoted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's tax break proposals also appear in early limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant and the Senate's chief
budget writer, said after paying for basics, the state has about
$2.5 billion left to cut taxes, give even more money to schools,
increase teachers' pay and other things. That could be billions
short for the promises Bush made.
</P>
<P>
   But Andy Welch, a former spokesman for the comptroller's office,
said it's not unusual for the comptroller to increase the amount of
money available later in the session.
</P>
<P>
   Welch, who served under Comptroller's Bob Bullock and John
Sharp, said previous administrations have used various ways of
increasing the amount of money available. They have either
aggressively audited taxpayers to get every penny to the state or
have understated available money in their estimates so more money
can be announced later. The practice is known as holding back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's any secret that the two previous
comptrollers certainly utilized those practices to the benefit of
their offices,'' Welch said. The additional money, he added, ``is
not all through tax collections and fiscal management.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler, expected to head the House Education Committee, said the
bottom line for evaluating Bush is to determine whether the core
principal of his ideas advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is people trying to decide if he's winning or
losing,'' he said.

GIULIANI PROPOSES VOUCHER EXPERIMENT FOR ONE NEW YORK CITY SCHOOL
DISTRICT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After warming in recent years to controversial
voucher programs that use tax dollars to send children to private
schools, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed such a plan Thursday
for New York City, saying it might force failing public schools to
improve.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said his inspiration was a program in Milwaukee that
uses tax dollars to send students below a certain income level to
private and parochial schools of their choice. He said he hoped to
experiment with vouchers in one of the city's community school
districts, a plan that would need the approval of Schools
Chancellor Rudy Crew and the Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal immediately drew criticism from the City
Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, and from educators who said it
would drain scarce funds from struggling public schools. Even Crew
expressed discomfort with the idea, saying he was more enthusiastic
about creating charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians and teacher groups have challenged the
Wisconsin program in court, saying it violates the First
Amendment's separation of church and state. But the Wisconsin
Supreme Court upheld Milwaukee's nine-year-old program last June,
saying that it did not ``have the primary effect of advancing
religion.'' The program prohibits private schools from requiring
students to participate in religious activities, and Giuliani
hinted that his own voucher program would have a similar provision.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony P. Coles, a senior adviser to the mayor, said that the
Wisconsin Supreme Court's recent decision to uphold the Milwaukee
program was ``very helpful'' and that New York's program would be
modeled on it. About 15 percent of the public school population
participates in the Milwaukee program.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Crew's apparent reservations, Coles expressed confidence
Thursday that the Board of Education would forge ahead with a pilot
voucher program. Since Giuliani wanted only a pilot program, it
would not need approval from the state Legislature, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important point is that we'll try it and see whether it
should or shouldn't be expanded,'' Coles said. ``Maybe it's an idea
that will not be terrific, but we'll never know that until we try
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of
Teachers, said her organization would fight a voucher program ``in
every way we can.'' She added, ``Vouchers can never educate all the
children that you need to educate, and they badly drain much needed
support from underfinanced public schools.''

TAKING THE BIG TEST AT PUBLIC SCHOOL 48 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Having been told by more than enough angry critics
that his articles read like the work of a fourth-grader, this
columnist decided to see how he stacked up against the real McCoy.
He spent three mornings this week taking the much-praised,
much-maligned statewide reading and writing test with Victoria
Gonzalez's fourth-graders at Public School 48 in Washington
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   To dispense with the bottom line right away, it would seem that
he qualified (are you listening, Ma?) for promotion to the fifth
grade. He aced a multiple-choice quiz, and though his written
essays were not graded right away, they probably met minimum
standards of grammar, punctuation and lucidity.
</P>
<P>
   But you are no doubt more interested in how his 23 classmates
did on this three-day exam that has put the fear of Zeus in so many
educators, parents and students across New York state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Piece of cake,'' one girl said after it was all over Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``So-so,'' another girl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of complicated,'' a boy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought it was hard, but it turned out to be the
easiest test I've ever taken,'' another boy said.
</P>
<P>
   Back and forth the opinions went, though most of them thought
they had done well and, not surprisingly, all were thrilled to
leave this ordeal behind.
</P>
<P>
   Public School 48, at Broadway and West 186th Street, opened in
1993, a handsome green-and-beige building with bright classrooms
and corridors. It has a comfortable feel, but also a sense of
order, underlined by the insistence of its principal, Daryle Young,
to begin each morning with both the Pledge of Allegiance and the
Star-Spangled Banner.
</P>
<P>
   But Public School 48 is hardly problem-free. It is already
overcrowded with 700 students. Most are of Dominican origin, and
English is far from everyone's first language. Although the share
of students reading at grade level has doubled since 1993, it
stands at 47 percent. Not bad, all things considered, Ms. Young
said, but there is still a way to go.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a while for the students to find out if their
generally upbeat mood Thursday was justified. You can count on
hearing continued disputes about whether the results have been
skewed by test-distribution foul-ups across the state and by the
fact that some youngsters _ though not those at Public School 48 _
had already studied some test material in their regular class work.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Young and Ms. Gonzalez had their own quarrels with the
mechanics of the exam, including its having been scheduled right
after the winter recess. But they both thought it a good test,
challenging but not too hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fact that they were asked to listen to what was
read and to take notes,'' Ms. Young said. ``We have a tendency to
think the students are not sophisticated enough to do that. We've
not exposed them to skills that they are capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gonzalez agreed, with a caveat. ``Standards have to be
raised,'' she said. ``But that has to happen from kindergarten. It
can't happen overnight in the fourth grade.''
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, his credentials as an educator being nil,
this overgrown fourth-grader-for-a-week thought the test was fair.
It exercised the students' imagination and their ability to write
clearly and grammatically about what they had read. But it was no
snap, either.
</P>
<P>
   Details have to be hedged here, part of a deal struck with the
Board of Education to gain admittance to the classroom. But it is
unclear how many fourth-graders, especially if English is their
second language, can readily recognize words like ``scurried,''
``scrawny'' and ``bounded.'' One story describes an Indian girl
making snow shoes in the shape of a birch leaf. Not to sound too
much like a New York provincial, but what does a birch leaf look
like?
</P>
<P>
   The multiple-choice section had a few questions that lent
themselves to more than one reasonable answer. Which phrase sounds
more fitting from an inventor: ``We'll wait'' or ``Let's see what
happens''? In context, the correct answer was clear. But when you
think about it, the patience implied in ``We'll wait'' may be as
useful to an inventor as the more impulsive alternative.
</P>
<P>
   And may a nonpedagogue toss in a tip to the test makers? In
measuring children's grasp of the language, you could strive for
good grammar yourselves. ``Julie brought her hands up to her face
and moved them up and down like he did,'' one passage read. That
``like'' should be, like, ``as.''

FINDING A GYM PROGRAM WHERE COUCH POTATO AND ATHLETE CAN
MEET  (Eds: see also HIGHSCHOOL-SPORTS-III, HIGHSCHOOL-WADE, By KIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joe Featherston is a gym teacher. In the New York
City public school system these days, that can be a lonely,
beside-the-point occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Featherston says, there is a silver lining to living in
neglect: it allows for creativity. If you teach science or math or
literature, there are endless rules about what must be taught. The
discretion of the individual teacher has withered. Gym, however,
can become genuinely new, especially in places like Benjamin N.
Cardozo High School in Queens, where Featherstone essentially has
reinvented the class.
</P>
<P>
   Featherston's central insight is that young people today are
divided into two great camps when it comes to physical activity.
One group is more interested in sports than ever, more obsessed
than even he was as a child with teams and victories.
</P>
<P>
   Another group almost totally is sedentary. The loose, organized
street play that was common when Featherston was growing up in
Brooklyn in the 1960s has been made all but extinct, he said, by
computers and videos and parental fears. The problem was how to
find the middle ground where couch potato and athlete could meet.
</P>
<P>
   The answer he devised was to kill off old-fashioned gym
entirely. Traditional ball-bouncing, rope-climbing gym was
eliminated in favor of weight training, fitness courses, aerobics
and dance. Featherston said he had found that teen-agers who had
little interest in becoming athletes were often very interested in
becoming fit.
</P>
<P>
   His creativity in teaching has produced a bonus: creative
financing. Freshmen at Cardozo take salsa dancing for their gym
requirement. It's active, sweaty, social and, perhaps best of all,
Featherston said, he actually gets money from the city to pay for
it _ arts education grants. Featherston figures it's close enough.
</P>
<P>
   By signing on with a program developed at Queens College called
PATH _ Physical Activity and Teen-Age Health _ Featherston was able
to get used health-club equipment. Through PATH, which is working
with 11 New York City high schools, he also gets a textbook that
portrays physical activity as part of a long-term life style, along
with good nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Featherston also believes that gym class in the 1990s has to
find a way to become relevant to the new academic priorities in
schools. What he teaches students is that exercise can keep them
healthy and reduce their risk of heart disease, but also it will
also make them learn better, through relaxation techniques and
stress management. ``If you have a lot of studying to do, you can
take No Doz and coffee, or you can go to the gym for half an hour
and come back fully energized,'' he said. ``Most kids are not aware
of these things because we're not teaching them _ we're missing the
boat.''

 (SUBS to move up and expand material concerning Hutchinson's
presentation.) REPUBLICAN MANAGERS BEGIN PRESENTING THEIR CASE (sw) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an atmosphere of sober formality, the
impeachment trial of President William Jefferson Clinton began in
earnest on Thursday in the U.S. States Senate, with the Republican
prosecution asserting that he should be removed from office because
of ``egregious and criminal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No man is above the law, and no man is below it,'' said Rep.
James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin a few moments after the gavel
fell, quoting President Theodore Roosevelt. Clinton was on trial,
Sensenbrenner said, because he ``decided to put himself above the
law not once, not twice, but repeatedly,'' to conceal his sexual
affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting as jurors in the momentous and divisive case, only the
second presidential impeachment trial in the history of the
Republic, the 100 members of the Senate listened in silence for six
hours as five Republican members of the House began laying out the
evidence. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, presiding, confined
himself to scripted procedural comments.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most forceful argument was made by Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, from Clinton's home state, Arkansas. A former U.S.
attorney (and the brother of Sen. Tim Hutchinson), he used
effective graphics and careful organization to develop more clearly
than had been done before the evidence that led House Republicans
to vote an article of impeachment charging obstruction of justice.
From myriad familiar details, he assembled coherent patterns and
chronologies and then drew potentially damaging conclusions from
them as to motive and credibility and relevance.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson made a number of points that seemed telling, though
it was not possible to determine whether they had any impact on the
senators.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has made much of the fact that Ms. Lewinsky's
job search started well before it was known that she was on the
Jones witness list. But Hutchinson was able to show that the search
gained urgency only in the hours immediately after the president
learned on Dec. 10 that she was on the list. Before that, by the
testimony of Clinton's close friend, Washington superlawyer Vernon
Jordan, it had a low priority.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the White House has argued that when Clinton led his
secretary, Betty Currie, through a spurious account of his
behavior, he could not have been encouraging false testimony
because she was not yet on a witness list. But Hutchinson pointed
out that the president had just come from giving a deposition in
which he repeatedly invoked his secretary as a possible
corroborating source, so he could well have surmised that she would
soon become a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson also noted that Ms. Lewinsky's denial of a sexual
relationship in an affidavit Clinton suggested she make came before
the point in the Jones case when the judge defined a sexual
relationship. It should therefore be construed as normal _ not
legal _ language, Hutchinsion said, and therefore a lie that the
president encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gray day, with a freezing drizzle falling
intermittently outside. A tone of understatement was set at the
beginning, when Rehnquist opened the proceedings with two laconic
sentences: ``The Senate will convene as a court of impeachment. The
chaplain will offer a prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself was absent, traveling to Alexandria, Va., across
the Potomac River, to promote crime prevention. He had planned to
go on to Wall Street, to encourage brokers to invest more in
minority business, but put off the trip until Friday because of bad
flying weather.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the inflammatory language that marked the
House hearings was absent, although Sensenbrenner, in an allusion
to the Watergate case, spoke of the need to excise ``a cancer on
the body politic.'' There were also what seemed to be occasional
misstatements and overstatements in the material presented by the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner, for example, made a point in his opening of
saying that Charles Ruff, a lawyer for the president, did not
answer ``directly,'' when he was asked in a House hearing, ``Did
the president lie during his sworn grand jury testimony?'' Gregory
B. Craig, another of Clinton's lawyers, said Thursday night that
``Mr. Sensenbrenner falsely characterized Mr. Ruff's testimony to
use it against the President, and he misled the Senate.'' He said
Sensenbrenner had asked Ruff if the president had ``told the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth'' when he testified
before the grand jury. Craig said, ``Mr. Ruff answered directly,
and I quote, `He surely did,' unquote.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the senators' deportment was much better than
the House members' had been. Most stayed in their seats, unwontedly
mute, sipping water, taking notes. A few stretched their backs
occasionally, as did Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   The decorum in the chamber suggested that after months of false
denouements, everyone realized that the last act of the drama had
begun.
</P>
<P>
   But the stream of partisanship flowed on relentlessly outside,
with Democrats accusing the Senate Republicans of procedural
double-dealing. The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, insisted
again that the House case was based not on law but on political
revenge. And the House Republicans kept pressing, whenever they got
the chance, for the right to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson and the other prosecutors wove into their
presentations strong pleas that witnesses, including Ms. Lewinsky,
be called to testify. At one point, Hutchinson said that he hoped
to be able to question Jordan about his role in securing a job for
Ms. Lewinsky at precisely the time that she was pondering whether
to execute a false affidavit that supported the president's
testimony in the sexual harassment suit filed by Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   With Jordan on the stand, Hutchinson said, ``You would need to
probe where his loyalties lie, listen to the tone of his voice,
look into his eyes and determine the truthfulness of his
statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson also suggested four other witnesses: Mrs. Currie;
John Podesta, the White House chief of staff; Sidney Blumenthal,
another presidential aide, and Clinton himself. Lockhart
immediately dismissed that last possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The witness question has been deferred until after the opening
statements. Thursday was the first of three days allotted to the
House Republican prosecutors. After a break on Sunday and Monday,
Martin Luther King Day, the president's lawyers, who listened
silently if intently on Thursday, will have three days to lay out
their rebuttal, and the senators will have two days to pose
questions, through the chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Senate will reach a crossroads. It must decide not only
whether to call witnesses but also whether to proceed any further
with the trial. The vote on witnesses or other new evidence will
come second, and not at all if the motion to end the trial carries.
Those votes require only simple majorities, not the two-thirds vote
needed to convict.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was 1:04 p.m., four minutes late, when the session began on
Thursday. The first prosecutor to speak was Rep. Henry J. Hyde of
Illinois, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have pledged to put aside personal bias and partisan
interest and to do impartial justice,'' Hyde admonished the
senators, although they are in fact free to vote as they choose for
whatever reasons they chose or for no stated reason at all, without
regard to the usual rules of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing beneath the marble dais on which Rehnquist sat in a
high-backed leather chair, resplendent in his black gown with four
gold stripes on each sleeve, Sensenbrenner said the president was
guilty of ``impeachable offenses,'' but he did not venture far into
the political and legal quagmire of exactly what constitutes an
impeachable offense. The definition was purposely left imprecise by
the founding fathers, and the Senate will eventually have to flesh
it out. The prosecutors will make their case on that issue on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wisconsin lawmaker did note that the Constitution listed
bribery as an impeachable offense and that perjury carries an
identical penalty under federal guidelines. He said that ``perjury
is the twin brother of bribery'' and hence one of the ``high crimes
and misdemeanors'' meant by the framers.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner commended Clinton for having confessed to an
improper relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, then a 21-year-old White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
   But he continued, in a Midwestern monotone that belied the high
drama of the occasion: ``He has not owned up to the false
testimony, the stonewalling and legal hairsplitting and obstructing
the courts from finding the truth. In doing so, he has turned his
affair into a public wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Next came Rep. Ed Bryant of Tennessee, charged with sketching in
the background of the events that led to the impeachment. Reaching
into the grab-bag of modern technology, he used a giant television
screen, erected in the Senate for the first time, to project the
image of Clinton taking the oath of office as president and
pledging to uphold the nation's laws.
</P>
<P>
   A certain ennui had settled over the chamber by the time he
finished. Nothing new was being said, and the old things were not
being said with either eloquence or color. But Hutchinson changed
the mood, as did Rep. James E. Rogan of California, who followed
him to spell out in detail the Republicans' several allegations of
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every turn,'' Hutchinson said of Clinton, ``he used
whatever means available to him to evade the truth, destroy
evidence, tamper with witnesses, and any other action required to
prevent evidence coming forth that would prove a truth contrary to
the president's interests.''

FINDING THE WORLD THROUGH SPORTS  (Eds: see also By KIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hank Whitney's life turned a corner in the early
1950s when he discovered basketball. He was poor and black and
growing up on welfare in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, and
the best he could look forward to, he said, was a factory job.
Instead he found a whole new world.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney had talent, but more than that, he said, he had access
to a city athletic system that worked. He played basketball _ and
learned the game _ in the public schools and community centers that
were always open until 10 p.m. He would even dribble the ball down
the hallway in his family's apartment building coming home. Then he
would do it all again the next night.
</P>
<P>
   Now as the principal at the same Brooklyn middle school where he
struggled and found his way, he mourns a world that has passed. The
sports system that worked for him has been nearly washed away by
the years, and Whitney tries to preserve whatever part of it he can
for kids in whom he sees a part of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to look from whence I came,'' said Whitney, a
6-foot-7-inch bear of a man with a voice so deep that it sounds as
if it's coming from the bottom of a well. ``I know what the system
did for me _ it saved my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitney, who is 59, was one of the first black athletes to win a
scholarship and a place on the previously all-white Iowa State
University basketball team in the late 1950s, one of three New York
City boys then on the team. He also helped found the American
Basketball Association and was one of the original members of the
New Jersey Americans _ now known as the Nets _ in 1967 until an
injury cut his career short after three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York City school system was spitting out athletes like
it was just unbelievable,'' he said. ``Throughout New York City,
all five boroughs, scholarships to just about every university in
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The crumbling of that world hit him hard. He was working in a
Brooklyn community center in 1969 when they were all closed. He was
teaching in the mid-1970s when the fiscal crisis rubbed out just
about everything that was left. In the mid-1980s, as principal of
his old school, Intermediate School 49, he had to cut his gym
program from five teachers to three.
</P>
<P>
   If the city's economy can stay strong, Whitney thinks more money
will start to trickle back down into sports and athletics. But he
is not waiting. He has assembled a package of private grants that
help him conduct after-school intramural programs.
</P>
<P>
   He gets enough to keep the school open until 6 p.m., four nights
a week for about three months, and he doles out those hours like a
miser. His central strategy is to keep kids off the street, and
thus out of trouble. Since he can't do that with after-school
programs alone, he also counts on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure the cold will keep them inside when that comes _ so
I'm covered there,'' he said. ``So we'll do it in the warm months,
to try and keep them inside then.''  &QL;

A `THIN RED' PUZZLER' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Moviegoers seeing ``The Thin Red Line'' when it opens
this weekend will know they've seen something impressive and
harrowing. They may also end up scratching their heads, wondering
just what it was all about.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike 1998's other big World War II movie, Steven Spielberg's
``Saving Private Ryan,'' Terrence Malick's ``The Thin Red Line''
sometimes seems to need, if not an interpreter, at least a tour
guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nonlinear,'' said Jim Caviezel, who plays one of the U.S.
Marines who hit the beaches of Guadalcanal, finding themselves in a
desperate struggle against the Japanese, their incompetent officers
and their private demons.
</P>
<P>
   Caviezel was in Houston recently to talk about the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like if you woke up from a dream and I said, `Tell me
about it,''' he said. ``And you said, `I started at Point A, and
then went to Point B, and then to Point D.' And I said, `Wait a
minute, what about Point C?' And you said, `It doesn't matter.'''
</P>
<P>
   A dream _ or nightmare _ is a good explanation for what viewers
experience in ``The Thin Red Line,'' which is based on the
best-selling 1962 book by James Jones, author of ``From Here to
Eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   The book begins with Marines below deck on a ship, waiting to
invade Guadalcanal. The movie starts with Pvt. Witt, Caviezel's
character, doing an introspective interior monologue while on a
tropical island where he and another Marine have gone absent
without leave. The two are soon captured and sent back to their
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the film, harrowing combat scenes as realistic and
frightening as those in ``Saving Private Ryan'' are mixed with
memories of stateside lovers, considerations of the meaning of war
and life, and intimate, personal moments that are more literary in
tone than what we usually see on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Often it seems like the soldiers are fighting themselves _ or
war itself _ rather than a tangible enemy, a notion emphasized by
our not even seeing the Japanese except as vague shapes or gun
flashes for the first hour of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a meditation on the evils of war, as powerful as any
personal prayer you could say in a moment of tragedy,'' Caviezel
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry Malick is like the professor Robin Williams plays in
`Dead Poets Society,' and he tells his students, `Open your book
and read the first couple of pages on how to write a poem.' The kid
starts to read it, and the professor says, `Tear it out. Don't let
anyone tell you how to make a poem.'
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what Terry does.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing Malick does is attract stars like metal shavings
to a magnet. The movie-star lineup in ``The Thin Red Line'' is
impressive: Sean Penn, George Clooney, John Travolta, Nick Nolte,
John Cusack, Woody Harrelson and John Savage.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Penn and Nolte, most of the stars have small roles,
appearing in the movie just for a chance to work with Malick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to be in it,'' Clooney said about his one-minute
role in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Malick, who lives in Austin, Texas, built a good reputation as a
director in the 1970s, based on only two films, which he also
wrote. They were the haunting young-criminals story ``Badlands''
and the heartbreakingly beautiful ``Days of Heaven.'' Neither was a
box-office hit, but both received good reviews and made it clear
that Malick was a filmmaker of unusual vision and extreme technical
skill.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Days of Heaven'' in 1978, for which he won several major
awards, Malick, a Rhodes Scholar, has been the J.D. Salinger of
cinema, retreating to Paris and almost completely from filmmaking.
His reputation as a recluse and the enforced absence from
filmmaking enhanced his status to near-legendary status.
</P>
<P>
   When word went out that Malick was again making a film _ a war
movie _ just about every male actor in Hollywood took notice. Which
explains why there are so many stars in the movie, and why Malick
was able to turn what the studio probably hoped would be a
straightforward, audience-thrilling war film into a complex, highly
personal ``meditation on the evils of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to back to Caviezel. With all these big names in
the cast, why is it that this virtual unknown has the largest role
in one of the most eagerly anticipated films in years? The movie is
an ensemble piece, with no real lead role, but Caviezel's Witt is
at its center.
</P>
<P>
   If the name of this rather shy young actor _ clearly
uncomfortable doing interviews _ doesn't ring any bells, don't feel
bad. You're not alone in not recognizing Caviezel, who was on the
verge of giving up acting before ``The Thin Red Line.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to playing this, Caviezel's most prominent role was
probably that of brother Warren Earp, in Kevin Costner's ``Wyatt
Earp'' in 1994. Most recently he was a minor character in ``G.I.
Jane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my wife, in another six months I'm seriously
considering wrapping this up,'' Caviezel said. ``Although I loved
acting, I felt it was important to be working. If we have kids, it
will be important that I pay bills. It would have been very
difficult (to quit) because I loved it, but I could always do
theater on the side.''
</P>
<P>
   Caviezel, 30, is tall and lean, but not as gaunt as he appears
in ``The Thin Red Line,'' where his tall frame _ ``On a good day
I'm maybe 6 feet, 2 inches; on a bad day maybe 6-1 1/2'' _ carried
only 170 pounds, because the Marines were supposed to look like
they have not eaten well. His now clean, handsome face looks
haggard and dirty in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Caviezel didn't know who Malick was when he auditioned and was
asked to go to Malick's house to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be truthful, when I went in and met with him, I kind of
told him, this is who I was and what was important to me. We really
didn't talk about the movie much. Maybe that had something to do
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``School and many things in my life have been difficult for me.
I've had to work a lot harder than most people. I always figured
college was for smart guys, so I came to Hollywood,'' he said with
a grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing was never a problem, and maybe it's a gift, is
character and integrity,'' said Caviezel, who is deeply religious.
``There are things that I believe in so strongly that I basically
have said I'm willing to give up what I'm doing in order to have my
family live a great life. I don't need to change. I need to be like
myself; this is who I am. From the get-go, that was either going to
push (Malick) away or draw us together.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it drew them together. Malick changed his mind about
the role he originally wanted Caviezel to play and cast him as the
moral Witt, who avoids killing, even when it might save his own
life.
</P>
<P>
   Caviezel also lucked out in the editing process. Originally,
Witt was just one of several important characters. Many other major
and minor roles were cut completely from the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we shot a record 1 1/2 million feet of film,''
Caviezel said. ``That's basically 50 movies. Coming out of
(shooting) that, it was like, well, what kind of film are we going
to have here?''
</P>
<P>
   Some filmgoers will be asking that question as they leave the
theater. Few will doubt ``The Thin Red Line'' is achingly beautiful
and frighteningly intense. But it is also a film that demands
complete attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone is very linear, Saving Private Ryan will work
brilliantly for them,'' Caviezel said. ```The Thin Red Line' could
have been about invading Guadalcanal, going to capture Henderson
(air) field, getting the Japanese off the island _ making it as
linear as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not. It's about the condition of the human heart and
spirit. It's about the thin red line between life and death,
between heaven and hell, between sane and insane. It stays true to
that line. It's not really tangible.''

EWING IS BACK, BUT WHERE ARE THE REST OF THE KNICKS?
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Patrick Ewing had shaken the beach sand out of
his clothes and the lockout clutter from his mind. The only
remaining evidence of his three-day getaway in Miami was the sunny
disposition he carried into the Knicks' practice facility on a
frigid afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After sleeping through a snowy landing Thursday, he was not the
least bit grumpy as he worked out with the Knicks in an informal
session for the first time since the lockout ended. Until Thursday,
his most rugged scrimmage had been against Alonzo Mourning and the
Miami Heat earlier this week. Ewing's choice of practice partners
was curious. Why allow the enemy to test the health of his wrist
and the condition of his body?
</P>
<P>
   One unidentified Heat player told reporters in Miami that he
could tell Ewing's mending wrist was still a hindrance to his game.
But Ewing did not see the scrimmage as a breach of security but as
an aid to his return after playing in just four games since
injuring his wrist on Dec. 20, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to go against Alonzo, who is one of the best centers in
the league,'' Ewing said between closed workouts at SUNY-Purchase.
``That's only going to help me. It was just as usual down there.
Alonzo was smacking me, elbowing me and hitting me on my hand. It's
the same old thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing had to look around the Knicks' facility Thursday and
wonder where everybody was. While the Heat had 10 players attend
its informal workouts this week, the Knicks had only Ewing, Marcus
Camby, Allan Houston, Herb Williams and Chris Mills. Thursday was
also Mills' first workout with the team since the lockout ended.
Only Houston has been at the facility every day this week.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing said he was a little disturbed about the turnout, but not
overly concerned. With free agents like Malik Sealy joining in,
there were enough bodies to hold a scrimmage. And for the first
time, Camby was side by side with Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still got it,'' Camby said. ``He's still tough. I don't
think he missed a shot. Herb was banging with him, and Patrick
looked fine to me.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Ewing has looked up to 20 pounds overweight to many
observers. During the six-month lockout, it was difficult for him
to follow a workout routine. His fitness has been a source of worry
for some within the organization. But Ewing is used to skepticism
and shrugged off concerns about his conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here 14 years,'' Ewing said. ``Everyone is going to
take shots when they feel they have the opportunity to. But on
February 5, the start of the season, that's when I have to be in
shape. I know I'm doing what I have to do, and that's my job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take pride in it. I do what I have to do in the off season
to come back the way I want to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's return for his 14th season will be missing something,
though. Michael Jordan is no longer an obstacle. Although Ewing has
often said he wanted to go through Chicago to capture a title,
Jordan's retirement has taken away that challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time for him to pack it in,'' Ewing said. ``It was
funny. During negotiations, Michael told me he was going to retire
and I didn't believe him.''

with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 228.63 points, or 2.45

   In a rare public forecast, the chief executive of Eastman Kodak,
George Fisher, told analysts that Kodak would earn $4.81 to $5.24 a

Kodak's other announcement, that its fourth-quarter earnings came
in 10 cents below estimates and that its sales declined. Shares of
Kodak plummeted $8.1875, or 10.4 percent, to $70.50.

   The debut of the second CBS news magazine ``60 Minutes'' scored

more than doubled the audience CBS had been attracting then. ``60
Minutes II'' had a 12.4 rating, 110 percent more than CBS has

WHAT KIND OF YEAR WILL RACING HAVE IN THE COUNTING HOUSE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.) (nk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, the New York Racing Association closed 1998 with its first
gain in attendance in 17 years. And the betting handle showed its
first gain in eight years. But before anyone jumps to any
irrationally exuberant conclusions, Terry Meyocks, president of the
association, said, ``We're cautiously optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyocks reports that the tracks at Aqueduct, Belmont and
Saratoga averaged 9,784 persons a day last year, a rise of 4
percent over the year before. Handle rose by 2 percent to a daily
average of $8.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody can say for certain whether the gains represent a
turnaround in a sport that has suffered declines in recent years.
Or whether they reflect the added business brought by wider
simulcast betting, or by an unusually dramatic bunch of horses led
by Real Quiet and Victory Gallop in the Triple Crown and Skip Away
and Awesome Again in the handicap division.
</P>
<P>
   The main element in the equation may have been the Belmont
Stakes: For the second straight year, the Triple Crown was on the
line. But Silver Charm was thwarted in 1997 by Touch Gold before
70,862 spectators, and Real Quiet lost in 1998 to Victory Gallop in
the deep home stretch before a throng of 80,162. And the crowd and
the handle for the 1998 Belmont Day set a record of more than $55
million.
</P>
<P>
   Another comforting sign might be seen in how the new year
started at Gulfstream Park in Florida, where most of New York's
good horses and trainers spend the winter.
</P>
<P>
   When Gulfstream opened on Jan. 3, officials at the track were
somewhat surprised at the size of the crowd: 31,837, the largest
for an opening day in the 60-year history of the track in
Hallandale. But nobody could be sure the good times would continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely beyond expectations,'' said Douglas Donn, president
of Gulfstream. ``We had expected 25,000. Realistically, I was
expecting 20,000. Why did we do so well? The entertainment value
and ambiance here at Gulfstream Park. It's an idea I've been trying
to get across to the public the last four years, and it's finally
been received.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``entertainment value'' no doubt included free access to the
grandstand on opening day, free parking, a free concert, hot dogs
at 60 cents for the 60th anniversary and a $60,000 drawing for
prizes.
</P>
<P>
   However, the ambiance changed drastically on the second day, a
rainy and cold Monday. Only 5,756 persons showed up. So, the race
for prosperity is still probably too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Rain, snow and sleet forced Aqueduct to cancel its racing
program Thursday. It also forced a one-day interruption in the
hottest new career at the track.
</P>
<P>
   He is only 16 years old and this is his first season of riding
in New York, but Ariel Smith has established himself as the most
promising new jockey of 1999. When he won the third and fifth races
at Aqueduct on Wednesday, he marked his 11th and 12th successes in
the two weeks he has been riding horses in New York, placing him in
the top eight riders in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   Smith arrives with some good omens: his father, Alfredo Smith,
was a top rider on the West Coast; his mother, Ursula, also rode
horses for a time. And his agent, Steve Adika, has been the regular
agent for Mike Smith, the star jockey who is recovering from racing
injuries (and who is no relation to the rookie prodigy).
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Smith is a soft-spoken young man who launched his career
last fall at Hollywood Park, where he finished among the 10 leading
riders. Then he came to New York with a seven-pound weight
allowance, which will be reduced to five pounds when he rides his
35th winner. He is also trying to enroll in high school to pursue
his education at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm learning every day,'' the prince of the rookies said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Mike Smith, who fractured two vertebrae in his neck
in a spill at Saratoga on Aug. 31, he expects to return to racing
in February at Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling good,'' he said, ``but I won't be able to tell
much more until I start getting on some horses.''

U.S. OLYMPIC OFFICIAL WITH TIES TO SALT LAKE GROUP RESIGNS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An executive of the U.S. Olympic Committee resigned Thursday
night after it was revealed that he also had a business
relationship with the Salt Lake Olympic Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The official was Alfredo LaMont, the U.S. Olympic Committee's
director of international relations. The USOC did not describe the
business relationship in a statement, except to say that it had
been made through the office of Tom Welch, who resigned in 1997 as
president of the SLOOC.
</P>
<P>
   One Olympic official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said that LaMont had received a four-figure consulting fee per
month from Salt Lake City, but was not certain of the duration of
the contract or whether it was ongoing. LaMont did not immediately
return a phone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concluded that Mr. LaMont's activities, which he indicated
he pursued independent of his USOC responsibilities, nonetheless
constitutes a conflict of interest,'' said USOC executive director
Dick Schultz in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, International Olympic Committee president Juan
Antonio Samaranch said nine IOC members face possible expulsion and
four face lesser penalties, but an IOC member investigating the
Salt Lake City bribery scandal said it was premature to speculate
on possible sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Associated Press in Lausanne, Switzerland,
Samaranch said that letters had been sent to 13 IOC members
implicated in the Salt Lake City scandal, asking them to explain
their actions involving such matters as cash payments, tuition aid,
medical treatment and lavish gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said that nine of the 114 IOC members face possible
expulsion and four face lesser sanctions such as warnings or
censure. But Jacques Rogge, a Belgian surgeon, who is one of six
members on the IOC panel investigating allegations of vote-buying
in Salt Lake City, said in an interview that it was ``way too
soon'' to say how many of the 13 face possible expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Rogge declined to name any of the 13 IOC members who have been
sent letters. Olympic officials, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, Thursday identified 10 of the 13. Seven have previously
been linked to the Salt Lake City scandal and have denied
wrongdoing. They are Anton Geesink of the Netherlands, Jean-Claude
Ganga of Congo Republic, David Sibandze of Swaziland, Bashir
Attarabulsi of Libya, Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador, Sergio Santander
Fantini of Chile and Pirjo Haeggman of Finland.
</P>
<P>
   One Olympic official said that letters had also been sent to
Vitaly Smirnov of Russia, Lamine Keita of Mali and Charles Mukora
of Kenya. None of the three could be reached immediately by
telephone for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC members have been asked to respond to the letters by
Tuesday. An IOC commission, headed by Dick Pound of Montreal, will
report on irregularities in the Salt Lake City bid to the IOC's
executive committee on Jan. 23 and 24th.

 &HT;    Bush derails plan for train connecting Florida's cities
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore and Trebor Banstetter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ A proposed 200 mph bullet train connecting
Miami, West Palm Beach, Orlando and Tampa ran off the rails
Thursday, spiked by a long-skeptical Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he will withhold further spending on the $6.3 billion
proposal, including more than $50 million of the $70 million the
Florida Legislature appropriated this year. House Speaker John
Thrasher joined him in doubts about ridership projections and
taxpayers' burden under the deal, which also relied on federal
loans and private investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial structure of this deal was not viable,'' Bush
said. ``I'm absolutely convinced of that.''
</P>
<P>
   A crucial influence on that decision was a probe of the project
by the U.S. General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress. The GAO's study is a damning look at the financial risks
of the project, a draft shows.
</P>
<P>
   A subdued David Gedney, FOX project director and chief
executive, said he accepted Bush's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that every new (governor) must make some major
policy decisions, and the governor has chosen to set aside
proceeding on this,'' he said from his Orlando office. ``That's his
prerogative.''
</P>
<P>
   Gedney said unless Bush changes his mind, FOX would not make any
attempt to revive the project. ``I respect his decision, and
without his support, the project isn't going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO concluded that it would have been at least two more
years before anyone could realistically assess the cost, financing,
ridership and construction schedule of the project, its report
shows. The agency reviewed the project because it was asking for $2
billion in federal loans.
</P>
<P>
   St. Lucie County officials, who hoped the high speed rail system
would bring 300 jobs at a maintenance facility, were also
disappointed at the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interest now is moving the money allocated for this
project to meet our road needs,'' County Administrator Doug
Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO's findings include:
</P>
<P>
   _ FOX overstated the potential ridership by as much as 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ The projected costs of $6 billion to $8 billion could actually
be much greater, because crucial environmental and financial
reviews have not yet begun.
</P>
<P>
   _ The project's financial backing is not complete, and the
sponsors have secured only 5 percent of the estimated money needed.
</P>
<P>
   _ The train's projected start date of 2005 is overly ambitious,
and could take years longer to begin.
</P>
<P>
   _ The rail system would drain money from a pool of federal
dollars intended to insure against the risks of projects funded
through federal loans. The rail system's huge, $2 billion federal
loan would require almost half of the $530 million in the insurance
pool _ making it difficult for the U.S. Department of
Transportation to loan money to other projects across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to this whole thing was having an outside agency like
the GAO take a hard look at the project, and coming to the
conclusion that it is too risky,'' said David Goodstein, vice
chairman of Boca Raton-based Derail the Bullet Train. ``Once the
governor had that in his hands, there was very little he could do
except say it made no sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodstein, state Sen. Ron Klein, D-Boca Raton, and Palm Beach
County Commissioner Burt Aaronson co-founded the group and were
among the plan's toughest critics.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said a major flaw of the bullet train proposal was its
failure to address a demonstrated need for alternative
transportation. ``I will support mass transit if it can provide a
real, viable solution to some of our transportation problems,'' he
said. ``This project just didn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   And even Bush said he was not necessarily against future
high-speed rail systems in the state _ even government-subsidized
ones under the right circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after more than a decade of debate and planning that led
to this proposal, it may be years before anyone tries again, at
least with government money. Florida has spent about $22 million on
the FOX project, mostly for ridership research, and will pay
another $5 million to $6 million to satisfy contractual
obligations, Bush aides said.
</P>
<P>
   One possible beneficiary is Tri-Rail, a commuter rail system
connecting Palm Beach, Broward and Dade counties, said Florida
Transportation Secretary Tom Barry.
</P>
<P>
   Barry had been a strong advocate of the bullet train but said he
``abided'' by Bush's decision, communicated to him Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's announcement means lawmakers gain more pork to fight over
but lose a major source of free trips to France. The FOX
consortium, which included the company that built France's
high-speed rail system, paid for scores of legislators and their
family members to go on trips to see the train, shop and sight-see.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Toni Jennings did not automatically declare the
project dead, and the Senate had scheduled a workshop for next week
on the bullet train.
</P>
<P>
   But the project cannot live without House support, and Speaker
John Thrasher said he fully supported Bush.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a time when Martin Luther King III, the son
of the man whose life we celebrate on Monday, might have been
called the reluctant namesake: hunkering down in his seat at
college when his father's name came up, calling himself Marty as
``a way to hide'' because the comparisons were too painful, the
pressure too great.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, King, who is 41, stepped in as the fourth president
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the civil rights
organization his father founded the year his son was born.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it would be wrong to assume his identity crisis was over.
</P>
<P>
   For while it was he who made the first approach to the SCLC,
King says, it took him ``four or five'' months to make his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to pray about assuming this position; I kept looking for
an answer,'' King, a tall, husky man who resembles his father
physically, but with a gentler, less urgent voice and speech, said
in a visit to New York this week. ``My passion was there, but there
were so many obstacles to address. I talked to probably 25 close
friends. Then one day I was talking to a friend of mine. I don't
remember his exact words, but tears just started coming in my eyes.
To me that was my sign that I had to rise to the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   What did the friend say that made King cry?
</P>
<P>
   ``That, in a sense, this is a birthright. This is the
organization your father began; it must be taken to another level.
The way he said it caused me to shed tears. Not tears of anger, of
course, or frustration. Certainly not joy. Tears that made me feel
that I had to assume this mantle.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy being a King these days. The family of the Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., once the spiritual first family of
Atlanta, shocked many over the last few years as they proclaimed
the innocence of James Earl Ray, who had once confessed to killing
Dr. King. The family was criticized by some again when King's
younger brother, Dexter, who has emerged as the family leader, sold
the rights to their father's work to Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it easy being Martin Luther King III. While generally
liked in his hometown, he is viewed by many as a lightweight who
makes a good living on the lecture circuit but who lacks the drive
and charisma to make the not quite moribund SCLC a force.
</P>
<P>
   He lost a race for political office in Georgia when it was
revealed that he owed $238,000 in back taxes and penalties on
income from lectures.
</P>
<P>
   There are also suggestions _ lethal for leadership _ that Mr.
King is a mama's boy. None of Dr. King's four children have
married; King, since graduating from college, has lived with his
mother. Hearing that he was to visit New York this week on behalf
of the organization Do Something and its Kindness and Justice
Challenge, a program for schoolchildren, one Atlanta political
observer sniffed contemptuously.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King III was 10 when his father was assassinated
in Memphis in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, King's mother, Coretta Scott King, took her
children to a labor protest in that city that Dr. King had been
scheduled to attend.
</P>
<P>
   If the apparent message was that Dr. King's children would have
to put their feelings aside in order to keep their father's mission
alive, King doesn't recall it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember resenting it,'' he says. ``I may have, later
on, subconsciously, but at the time we didn't have time to stop and
think of how we felt. My mother said, `Daddy has gone to live with
God,' and that was enough for me; I didn't ask questions.''
</P>
<P>
   A further explanation of the psyche of Dr. King's second child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a rebellious nature,'' King says. ``If my mother
said, `There is a fire down the street; do not go there,' Dexter
and Yolanda would want to go. For the most part, I would not go.
Children go through a stage where they want to party, but I never
had an abundance of alcohol, never had a desire to do drugs, never
had a real indulgence'' _ a laugh here _ ``other than food. My
sister Bernice told us she potentially could have become an
alcoholic; she almost wanted to commit suicide. I never had
anything like that. I was an obedient child.''
</P>
<P>
   King graduated from Morehouse College with a degree in political
science, worked briefly in the hotel business, then returned to
public service and politics. In 1993, he ran for the chairmanship
of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners and lost after his
opponent broke the news of King's unpaid taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most difficult times of my life,'' he says.
``It was a story all over the world _ Martin Luther King's son
loses. I went into counseling to address the issues which were
troubling me. I was depressed, functionally; I became like a
hermit, staying at home. I had about six sessions and thought it
was going very well. I did not finish it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has now begun working on a book about ``how one can overcome
what some may consider adversity, in my case having a name that is
bigger than life, how you become your own self, what struggles you
go through.''
</P>
<P>
   If King had not lost his father, what does he believe he would
have done with his life?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I would have assisted him,'' King says. ``I do have,
for some reason, this desire to save the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Does King have a dream?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I had a choice.''

VICTIM   TURNS SLEUTH   AND DIALS B   FOR BURGLARY SUSPECT
</HEADLINE>
   (dw) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Criminal masterminds, most police officers say, are
rare birds. The case of a parolee who was captured and arrested on
burglary charges in Brooklyn early Thursday morning did little to
shake that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   The burglary suspect, who was accused of stealing credit cards,
jewelry and a cellular phone from the home of a man in Brooklyn's
Crown Heights neighborhood, was caught after the victim called him
on the stolen phone and set up a meeting to buy it back, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Stanley Seewald, 46, even haggled a bit over the
price in the interest of verisimilitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted $200,'' Seewald said in an interview. ``I told him,
`Brand new it costs $179!''' They eventually settled on $80 and
agreed on a meeting place.
</P>
<P>
   Seewald woke up during the burglary just before 3 a.m. and was
scratched when he confronted the thief; he then called the police.
</P>
<P>
   Two police officers climbed into the back of Seewald's Chevrolet
Suburban and, hidden behind its tinted glass, accompanied him to
the rendezvous.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, the police said, a man walked up to the vehicle and
asked for the money. Seewald asked to see the phone. When the man
took out the cellular phone, the police officers jumped out of the
back seat and handcuffed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't know what hit him,'' said Seewald, who works in
marketing and investments.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Robert Jones, 35, has been convicted of crimes
eight times since 1982, mostly for burglaries, said Joseph
Pentangelo, a Police Department spokesman.

ON TENNIS: SPORT IS FIGHTING TO TOSS OUT KORDA
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1998, he was an Australian Open hero. But in 1999, Petr Korda
feels distinctly unwelcome at the Grand Slam event he won last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Tainted by a steroid scandal, he's being pressured by players to
abandon his title defense. Meanwhile, the International Tennis
Federation, whose drug test Korda failed at Wimbledon last July,
wants to overrule its own Appeals Committee, which docked Korda's
Wimbledon prize money and ranking points but imposed no suspension.
The ITF would like to toss Korda out of tennis for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Afraid that Korda's sentence will create a precedent where
players caught with steroids in their systems escape punishment by
professing ignorance, the ITF has set a different precedent by
becoming the first sports federation to appeal a drug ruling to the
Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   A final decision on Korda's fate is expected by April.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out to conduct a witch hunt on Petr Korda,'' an ITF
spokesman, Alun James, said from Sydney on Wednesday morning, ``but
we believe the Appeals Committee misapplied the rule. We do not
feel extenuating circumstances were proven by Korda, and we feel a
suspension is warranted. A blanket `I don't know how the drugs got
there' is not sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   After learning that some players were demanding his suspension
and threatening to boycott the Australian Open if he attempts to
defend his title beginning next week, Korda appeared at a Melbourne
news conference on Tuesday to reiterate his innocence and his
intention to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to play in Australia because I haven't done anything;
why should I hide?'' Korda said. ``I wish to state categorically
that I am not a drugs cheat.''
</P>
<P>
   Korda said he would not duck an ATP Tour players meeting
scheduled for Saturday in Melbourne, where several prominent
players, including Jim Courier and Jonas Bjorkman, have demanded
that the ITF explain why Korda is being allowed to compete.
</P>
<P>
   The ATP Tour head, Mark Miles, said players calling for Korda's
suspension ``should not be hasty to draw conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think this is personal about Petr: I think it
shows a zero tolerance for cheating,'' he said. ``The good news is
that our players are demanding a clean sport and a doping program
that has real teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles said this case could lead to policy revisions defining the
``extenuating circumstances'' for an offender to avoid the
mandatory one-year ban: ``We never intended that a general denial,
however sincere, by a player would be acceptable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi, who practiced in Melbourne this week with Korda
and beat him, 7-6 (11-9), 6-2, was disinclined to support the
suspension. But Agassi acknowledged the need for the ITF to explain
its ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel the need to give the benefit of the doubt to Petr, but
we have certain rules, and to find out the reasons behind the
decisions that are made is something the players are entitled to,''
Agassi told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In two previous brushes with steroid infractions, tennis came to
disparate conclusions. When Ignacio Truyol of Spain tested
positive, he was suspended by the ATP Tour for a year in January
1997 despite his protest that the drug was prescribed for a back
injury. When U.S. amateur Samantha Reeves tested positive for
nandrolone metabolites in December 1997, the ITF upheld an Appeals
Committee's decision that Reeves not be suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the Reeves case and Korda's, according to
James, is that Reeves admitted that she had taken Nor-Andro 19,
sold over the counter as a food additive, and argued that she
didn't know it contained a steroid. The ITF was aggravated by
Korda's refusal to provide specifics on how the steroid might have
entered his system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not after giving rewards to players who come up with the
best excuses, but we believe this case sets a worrying precedent
where players will feel they can hide behind a blanket ``I don't
know,''' James said. ``It does look a little strange for us to go
against our own Appeals Committee, but we need to have a
clarification on the ruling, the consequence of which might be a
ban to Korda.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Korda, of the Czech Republic, punctuated his first
Grand Slam championship with a giddy reference to the unlikely
durability of his pale and scrawny 29-year-old musculature.
</P>
<P>
   The self-described weakling became the oldest man to win a Grand
Slam since Andres Gomez, a 30-year-old Ecuadorean, captured the
1990 French Open. In what he hinted would be his final year on
tour, Korda charged out to a 14-0 start in 1998 and several times
came within a match or two of usurping Pete Sampras' No. 1 ranking.
But at Wimbledon, mandatory drug testing after his quarterfinal
finish revealed nandrolone metabolites, and he spent last fall
tussling with the ITF.
</P>
<P>
   Korda, who is not seeded for the Australian Open, finished 1998
with a record of 20-21, including first-round defeats at the French
Open and the U.S. Open. He was censured by the ITF on Dec. 22, when
it was revealed that he had tested positive for a Class One banned
substance but would not be subjected to the mandatory one-year
suspension stipulated by the shared drug policy of the ITF and the
WTA and ATP tours. Then, on Jan. 6, the ITF's president, Brian
Tobin, announced the decision to pursue Korda's suspension. The ITF
insists it is not trying to victimize Korda, but he disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I proved my innocence in accordance with the ITF's own
rules,'' he said. ``I would like to think everyone will now respect
that finding.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it looks as if most everybody won't.

SIGNING FLEURY A THEO-RETICAL RISK
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ If a team decides to make a deal for Theoren
Fleury before the March 23 trading deadline, it probably will be
taking a risk in acquiring the Calgary Flames' star right wing, who
will be an unrestricted free agent after the season.
</P>
<P>
   So said Fleury on Thursday before the Flames faced the Kings at
the Forum. Fleury, 30, has been the subject of trade rumors all
season, with speculation growing that the Flames will trade him
this season rather than lose him as a free agent without
compensation during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably not,'' Fleury said when asked if there was a chance
he would sign this season with a team that traded for him. ``I've
gone this far. I might as well go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleury's stance could have a chilling effect on teams
considering trading for him. Under similar circumstances three
years ago, the Kings traded prospective unrestricted free agent
Wayne Gretzky to St. Louis for three players and two draft choices.
The Blues were never able to sign Gretzky, and received no
compensation after the season when Gretzky bolted to the New York
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, without commenting specifically on Fleury, Kings
general manager Dave Taylor said the risk of trading for a player
who could leave soon thereafter as a free agent wasn't one he
automatically would shy away from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, in any deal, the more security you have, the more
you're willing to spend in any deal,'' Taylor said. ``If you're
only guaranteed to have a player for three months, you'd give up
less than if you're going to have somebody for five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleury said he would be interested in playing for the Kings if
things don't work out with the Flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure, it's a good situation,'' he said. ``They're coming
into a new building and there are a lot of great players here. I
want to stay out west if I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the NHL's collective bargaining agreement,
players become eligible for unrestricted free agency when they are
31 or older. Fleury, who will earn $2.4 million this season in the
last year of his contract, turns 31 on June 29, two days before
free-agent bidding begins.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had any sense of whether or not the Flames would
trade him, Fleury said: ``I've answered that question at least a
thousand times. I'm still here. I'm just trying to do whatever I
can to get this team into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleury, who led the Flames with 44 points going into Thursday's
game, said Calgary probably will have the first and last cracks at
signing him. The Flames are the only team he has played for in his
11-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro optimistic: Two days after undergoing surgery to repair
the torn meniscus cartilage in his right knee, center Ray Ferraro
said he is optimistic he will return to the lineup by the middle of
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going great,'' Ferraro said. ``The doctor was happy with
what went on. Obviously, I want to be playing. I'll try to get
there as quick as I can. It feels great. There's some soreness. I
worked out and rode the bike, and short of putting a timetable on
it, it's not six weeks. It will be much quicker than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro was sidelined much of last season with injuries to his
left knee, but he said this injury isn't nearly as severe as that
one was, and added that he won't need to wear a brace when he
returns to the lineup. When he was injured on Jan. 5 in Edmonton,
Ferraro was one of the hottest Kings, with seven points in eight
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really, really disappointed,'' Ferraro said of his
initial reaction to the injury. ``Basically, I told my wife I
didn't want to talk to anybody for a day or two. I was upset. But I
rallied. Time is a good healer. I don't fear the rehabilitation. I
know I'll come back strong. The trick is to come back playing with
the same feeling and intensity as I did before I was hurt. I feel I
can do that.''

EDDIE D HAS NERVES OF STEEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ Eddie Delahoussaye's 5,992 winning rides include two
Kentucky Derbies, two Belmonts, a Preakness, a Breeders' Cup
Classic and a dozen other major horse races. The one this Eddie D
fan remembers most fondly is his victory aboard Fowda in the 1991
Hollywood Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Fowda took a comfortable lead in the first turn of the 1[-mile
race. Then one of her opponents tried to quicken the pace, chased
by a second and a third. So Delahoussaye did something that few
jockeys have the confidence to try. He let all three horses pass
him as they rushed to the far turn at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   Fowda dropped nearly a length out of the lead before the new
leaders tired and Delahoussaye wound up winning a stretch-long
battle with Chris McCarron by a stylish nose. It just doesn't
happen that way. Except in the movies, or when Eddie D's riding.
</P>
<P>
   ``My instinct is to let 'em go by me (when) they're moving
sooner than I would move. Then, when I call on my horse, they come
back,'' Delahoussaye, 47, said before the Santa Anita races
Thursday. ``I picked that up from watching (Bill) Shoemaker a lot.
But I learned it from riding and trying and getting that feel. It's
hard to explain. It's a feel you get. I'm not sure too many riders
ever get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowda's victory wasn't just artistic, it was significant. It
made Delahoussaye the seventh jockey to top $100million in purses.
</P>
<P>
   Now Delahoussaye is close to another milestone. Eight more
victories and he'll be the 14th to ride 6,000 winners.
</P>
<P>
   The ones he's proudest of aren't necessarily the Derbies (with
Gato del Sol, 1982, and Sunny's Halo, '83), the Belmonts (Risen
Star, '88, and A.P. Indy, '92), the Preakness (Risen Star) and the
Classic (A.P. Indy, '92).
</P>
<P>
   ``I rode a horse one year at the Fair Grounds (in New Orleans).
A Letter to Harry. He was one of my favorite horses,'' said
Delahoussaye, a Cajun who joined the Southern California circuit
after leading the nation in victories in 1978. ``Usually he's in
mid-pack. One day we're on the lead at the five-eighths pole. And
we're !ital!walking. But by the time I hit the three-eighths pole
I'm last. All those jocks realize I'm going so slow they panic and
rush their horses up.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time they come to the stretch they're dead. I wheel him
out at the head of stretch and win by five. The sportswriters
freaked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahoussaye would like to make his 6,000th memorable for more
than the number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just make it a little exciting,'' he said with a smile.
``Maybe we could have a couple (horses) pass us and come back and
win. That'd top everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend: Delahoussaye likes his chances with Mail Coach in
Saturday's San Fernando Stakes, a 11/16-mile race that drew eight
4-year-olds. He calls Mail Coach ``The Left-Hander'' because of the
Chile-bred's failure to change lead legs when he ran a closing
fourth in the Malibu Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Mail Coach will have to beat the three horses who finished ahead
of him in the Malibu: winner Run Man Run, Artax and Event of the
Year.
</P>
<P>
   Run Man Run would be the first to take the first two legs of the
Strub Series since On the Line in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the Martin Luther King weekend, Manistique goes for her
fifth win in six starts in Sunday's El Encino for 4-year-old
fillies, and River Bay carries a race-high 121 pounds when he faces
the Ron McAnally-trained duo of Brave Act (120) and Fragrant Mix
(120) in Monday's San Marcos Handicap on turf.
</P>
<P>
   106 days to go: The long road to the Kentucky Derby begins
Saturday at Gulfstream Park, which runs the 11/16-mile Holy Bull
Stakes, and at Golden Gate Fields, which has the 11/16-mile Golden
Gate Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-horse Holy Bull field includes three from Kentucky
Derby-winning barns _ Carl Nafzger's Vicar, Nick Zito's Doneraile
Court and D. Wayne Lukas' Mountain Range. The eight-horse Golden
Gate race is headed by the Golden Eagle Farms entry Voice of
Destiny and Absolute Harmony.
</P>
<P>
   As for higher-rated Derby contenders: Bob Baffert-trained
Exploit makes his 1999 debut in the Feb. 6 San Vicente at Santa
Anita. Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner Answer Lively is scheduled for
the Jan. 30 Lecomte at the Fair Grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Heezstillaputz: The 6-year-old gelding Heezaputz was to make his
first start under the cleaned-up name Samuel Alan in Thursday's
fourth race. But he pitched a fit in the starting gate _ where he's
trouble under any name _ and was scratched.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Alan is the name of trainer Roger Stein's 11-year-old
son. Stein gave it to the horse after the Jockey Club, acting on
complaints from fans about the old name's Yiddish meaning, asked
for a change.
</P>
<P>
   It's another proud moment for the prissy Jockey Club, which had
no problem with Nice Assay, Isitingood, Bodacious Tatas,
Wintercourse and Ben Dover, but couldn't put up with Heezaputz. In
this case, the horse raced 40 times before the Jockey Club
noticed. &QL;
