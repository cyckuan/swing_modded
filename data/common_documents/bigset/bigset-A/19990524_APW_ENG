<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Brady Anderson set an American League record  
tonight by getting hit by a pitch twice in the same inning, and he 
scored twice during the Baltimore Orioles' 10-run first inning 
against the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, the Orioles' leadoff hitter, was hit twice in the  
first inning by Texas pitcher Mike Morgan. Manager Johnny Oates 
removed Morgan after Anderson was hit for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third time in modern history that a player has been  
hit by a pitch twice in the same inning. Willard Schmidt of the 
Cincinnati Reds did it on April 26, 1959, and Frank Thomas of the 
New York Mets was hit twice on April 29, 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson scored the first time on a sacrifice fly and came in  
the second time on a three-run double by Mike Bordick. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson has been been hit by a pitch eight times this season,  
high on the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-run inning tied an Oriole record, reached three times  
previously, the last time on Aug. 21, 1985, against Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Genealogy Web Site Swamped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- People checking out a new genealogical Web  
site on Monday for details about their family's history ran into a 
very modern problem -- computer overload. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mormon church's new genealogical Web site,  
www.familysearch.org, was formally unveiled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The site's search engine looks through Mormon records of 400  
million names of people who lived as long ago as 1500, many of them 
with pedigree charts, as well as through 4,000 other Web sites 
devoted to genealogy. It's one of the hottest hobbyist categories 
on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The site was overwhelmed by demand on Monday, forcing partner  
IBM to add a backup computer to handle Internet traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	It was down for six hours because the pipeline into the IBM  
computer servers became clogged, said Elder D. Todd Christofferson, 
executive director of the church's Family History Department. When 
it came back up in the afternoon, the site averaged 500 hits a 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's triple, quadruple what they anticipated,'' said Jan  
Walbridge, an IBM spokeswoman. ``They did plan for a backup system, 
but they didn't think they'd have to use it so soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the six-hour hiatus, the site that puts part of the  
world's biggest genealogical database online was being hit at a 
rate of 30 million a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The site averaged seven million hits a day during its test phase  
that began April 1, and Monday was the first day it was a 
full-fledged site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seeking to understand our family history can change our  
lives,'' said church President Gordon B. Hinckley, who pushed a 
button to cut a virtual ribbon for the site during a news 
conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're grateful to be able to make a significant contribution  
to this great process,'' said Hinckley, considered a prophet by 
members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	To Mormons, genealogy is a religious obligation. It was for them  
-- and for everyone longing to trace their roots -- that the church 
began placing its vast family history records online, Hinckley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mormons are obligated to find the names of ancestors to baptize  
by proxy, an ordinance they believe gives the dead the opportunity 
to embrace the faith in the afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
	To make it easier, the church for more than a century has  
collected parish and civil records throughout the world. The 
records, now all on microfilm, are stored in a granite vault in the 
Wasatch Mountains 25 miles southeast of Salt Lake, and copies are 
at the Mormon Family History Library downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	The library, its 3,200 branches worldwide and now the Web site,  
are open to members and nonmembers free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The church plans to add 200 million more names to the site by  
the end of the year, and hopes to eventually transfer its records 
on 2 billion people into electronic form. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley said the venture has cost the church ``a very great  
deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not get involved in this undertaking for monetary gain  
of any kind,'' he said. ``Our motives are to help members of the 
church and others find their roots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The church is not using the site to recruit potential converts,  
although anyone interested in learning about the faith can request 
information online, Christofferson said.

<HEADLINE> This Promotion Really Cuts Mustard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bill Veeck would have relished this: a machine  
that shoots bagged hot dogs into the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	Real ones.  
</P>
<P>
	Fully cooked.  
</P>
<P>
	With mustard, too.  
</P>
<P>
	The frankfurters are sent flying from a 3-foot long plastic  
tube, a hot dog-shaped launcher. They soar 110 feet into the 
stands, and the good news is nobody gets hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	In Philadelphia, the first team to buy into this scheme, the hot  
dogs are shot into the crowd by the Phillies Phanatic. Was that 
cute, green, fuzzy character inhibited about aiming this 
bazooka-looking contraption at the fans? 
</P>
<P>
	``Inhibited?'' says Doug Verb, whose company, Action Sports  
America, sends the hot dogs soaring. ``Are you kidding? He's the 
Phanatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Cardinals and Anaheim Angels are also in the  
flying frankfurter business and so are a bunch of minor league 
teams from the Durham Bulls to the Lansing Lugnuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Now this might seem off the chart to some buttoned-down teams,  
and certainly Verb has met pockets of resistance from those who 
disdain gimmickry. 
</P>
<P>
	So did Veeck when he sent a midget to bat and installed showers  
in the bleachers at Comiskey Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``What can be so terrible?'' Verb said. ``What's the worst thing  
that can happen? The hot dog doesn't fire? If nothing happens, it's 
still funny. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people are progressive and want to do new things. Look at  
the Diamondbacks' ballpark in Arizona. It has a pool and hot tub. 
Is that such an outlandish idea? I don't think so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was with this in mind that Verb also began the world's  
largest jersey promotions, inviting fans to sign their favorite 
team shirt. It's sort of an autograph session in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the 15-foot high creations hung on Yankee Stadium during  
the playoffs a couple of years ago. That's when Verb learned there 
are 80 pinstripes on the classic Yankees jersey and each is 
considerably larger when the jersey measures 22 feet across the 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	This all started innocently enough when Verb, a reformed sports  
writer, was working for the Chicago Sting soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Soccer needed total entertainment,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He was open to any and all ideas -- piped-in music, halftime  
promotions -- and they worked. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all about the fun of the game and fun for the fans,''  
Verb said. ``We wanted to get the crowd involved and make it fun. 
We knew if we did that, they'd come back. And they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Michael Jordan's first two years in Chicago, the Sting  
averaged larger crowds than the Bulls and the Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``And this,'' Verb said, ``was with a team that didn't make the  
playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Verb is always shopping for ways to entertain customers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love anything that's new and different,'' he said. ``I like  
to think I have boundaries, but I can't think of anything I've ever 
said `no,' to.''

<HEADLINE> Approval Day Is Here for Snyder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Howard Milstein walked out of the hotel in  
Atlanta immediately after withdrawing his $800 million bid for the 
Washington Redskins last month. His minority partner, Daniel 
Snyder, stayed behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder avoided the cameras, took the elevator to his room and  
spent the next few hours on the phone putting together his own bid 
-- one that could win. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-eight days later, Snyder is back in Atlanta for another  
NFL meeting. Barring a major surprise, his $800 million offer for 
the Redskins and Jack Kent Cooke Stadium will win easy approval 
Tuesday, making the 34-year-old Bethesda, Md., communications 
executive the youngest owner in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't anticipate any problems,'' New England Patriots owner  
Bob Kraft said last week after the finance committee unanimously 
voted to recommend Snyder's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	While Milstein had problems from the start, Snyder was able to  
watch and learn from the mistakes and has done just about 
everything right in the eyes of the league office and the other 
team owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein relied exclusively on borrowed money, so Snyder and new  
partners Fred Drasner and Mort Zuckerman are putting up more than 
$350 million cash. Milstein asked politicians to lobby for him and 
his campaign was very visible in the media, an approach that 
rankled many owners, so Snyder has been quiet and the leaks to the 
press have dried up. Milstein came with a reputation for being 
litigious in his other business dealings, while Snyder emerged 
virtually unscathed from the league's background checks. 
</P>
<P>
	When Milstein's bid was submitted by the estate of late owner  
Cooke in January, commissioner Paul Tagliabue and some owners 
pointed out that only the league could choose its membership. After 
Milstein withdrew, the trustees worked more closely with the league 
office the second time around to gain more input before submitting 
Snyder's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein, meanwhile, says he was unfairly treated. He filed suit  
last week against team president John Kent Cooke and general 
manager Charley Casserly, claiming they undermined the process by 
persuading owners to vote against him in order to get Cooke's own 
bid approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein pulled out April 7 when it became apparent he did not  
have the necessary 24 votes for approval from the 31 owners. Cooke 
attempted to re-enter the bidding, but the trustees negotiated only 
with Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein's suit seeks tens of millions of dollars in damages,  
but does not attempt to prevent the sale of the team to Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	If the sale is approved, Snyder and his bankers will begin the  
process of closing the deal. Once the money is exchanged, in June, 
Snyder will become the majority owner and thus end 25 years of 
Cooke family control of one of the league's high-profile 
franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Kent Cooke, who became majority owner in 1974, died in  
1997. Rather than leave the team and stadium to John, his only 
surviving son, the elder Cooke ordered in his will that the assets 
be sold to fund a charitable foundation that would grant 
postgraduate scholarships.

	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Katie Douglas and Camille Cooper  
of NCAA champion Purdue were among 12 players chosen Monday for the 
U.S. women's basketball team that will play in the World University 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas, who made the all-Final Four team, and Cooper were key  
figures in Purdue's 34-1 season that ended with a 62-45 victory 
over Duke in the national championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trying to win a gold medal is going to mean a lot,'' Douglas  
said. ``It's going to mean you're the best team in the world. We 
won the national championship and we were the best team in the 
country this past season, but this is bigger than that. You're 
competing against the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twins Kelly and Coco Miller of Final Four participant Georgia  
also made the team, which was chosen after six days of tryouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Also selected were LaQuanda Barksdale of North Carolina,  
Rasheeda Clark of Pepperdine, Helen Darling of Penn State, Janae 
Hubbard of UCLA, Brandi McCain of Florida, Ruth Riley of Notre 
Dame, Ayana Walker of Louisiana Tech and Brooke Wyckoff of Florida 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State's Rene Portland will coach the U.S. team. The World  
University Games, open to athletes ages 17-28, are July 1-13 in 
Palma de Mallorca, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwina Brown of Texas and Lynn Pride of Kansas also took part in  
the trials and were selected as the first two members of the Pan 
American Games team. The rest of that team will be selected from a 
pool of players available after the WNBA teams finalize their 
rosters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pan American Games basketball competition is July 30-Aug. 8  
in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Released From Maryland Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A beaming Mike Tyson walked out of a suburban  
Maryland jail Monday after serving less than a quarter of his 
one-year sentence for assaulting two motorists after a 
fender-bender. 
</P>
<P>
	``His release was long overdue, as far as I'm concerned,'' his  
attorney, Paul Kemp, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson left the Rockville, Md., jail where he spent the past 3 1/2  
months wearing a white T-shirt, gray sweatpants and prison-issue 
sandals. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion smiled but said nothing to  
reporters outside the jail. Tyson and a friend got into a car where 
his wife, Monica, waited to take him home to change clothes before 
meeting with his Maryland probation officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's release came hours after an Indiana judge announced her  
decision to end Tyson's probation for a 1992 rape conviction. The 
Maryland Parole Commission voted 5-1 on Friday to grant Tyson's 
release, but Indiana authorities needed to approve the decision 
before Tyson could go home. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson will be on parole until February, said Leonard A. Sipes, a  
spokesman for the Maryland Department of Public Safety and 
Correctional Services. He also must meet certain probation 
conditions -- including 200 hours of community service -- during the 
next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson will be subject to urine testing at least twice a week and  
unannounced home visits by state authorities, Sipes said. He must 
also receive permission before leaving Maryland, complete a 
psychiatric evaluation and undergo anger management treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelley Finkel, Tyson's manager, said he will ``have to sit down  
and talk with Mike about his boxing plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought Tyson might fight this year, Finkel said,  
``I haven't seen any reason for him not to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Kemp, the boxer's attorney, said Tyson's first priority is  
to ``try and relax and be with his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all that he's been looking forward to for the past 3 1/2  
months,'' Kemp said. ``Careerwise, there's talk about trying to 
resume his career -- that is to think about tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has three fights remaining on a deal with the MGM Grand in  
Las Vegas and at least three more fights with Showtime, the cable 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old boxer last fought Jan. 16 and was behind on all  
three cards before he knocked out Francois Botha in the fifth round 
at Las Vegas. That fight was Tyson's first after getting back his 
boxing license. Nevada boxing authorities revoked the license on 
Oct. 19 after Tyson was disqualified for biting Evander Holyfield's 
ears on June 28, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault charges stemming  
from a minor traffic accident in suburban Gaithersburg, Md. He was 
sentenced on Feb. 5 to one year in a Montgomery County jail, but 
another 60 days were added as punishment for violating probation on 
his rape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	In her ruling, Superior Court Judge Patricia Gifford of Marion  
County, Ind., said the jail time Tyson had served in Maryland 
satisfied the penalty he incurred for violating terms of his 
Indiana probation.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Drug Kingpin Found Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An accused drug kingpin was convicted Monday of  
running a nine-year conspiracy that federal prosecutors say put 
three tons of cocaine on Chicago's streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal sentencing guidelines call for a mandatory life sentence  
for Nate Hill, 32. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Hill was the top supplier of cocaine to both  
the Gangster Disciples and Vice Lords street gangs for many years 
but was never a member of any gang himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, who hid from prosecutors for more than a year in the  
African nation of Guinea, was convicted by a federal court jury 
that had deliberated for more than two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill was convicted of conspiracy, masterminding a criminal  
enterprise, plotting to defraud the government out of tax money and 
money laundering. He was acquitted of conspiring to launder money, 
and the jurors could not reach a verdict on a charge of attempting 
to possess drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Two dozen members of Hill's drug ring have been convicted over  
the last three years, according to Randall Samborn, a spokesman for 
the U.S. attorney's office.

<HEADLINE> Drug Co. Accused of Funding Stories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A medical researcher says he would not have  
written an article promoting fen-phen had he known it was paid for 
and edited by the company that made half of the popular diet drug 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really deceptive,'' said Dr. Albert Stunkard, whose  
article was published in the American Journal of Medicine in 
February 1996. ``It sort of makes you uneasy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lawsuit claims that Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories hired  
ghostwriters for articles promoting obesity treatment and then used 
prominent researchers such as Stunkard to publish the works under 
their names. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit accuses the company that made the ``fen'' half of the  
drug combination hid health risks associated with the drugs. The 
company allegedly tried to play down or remove descriptions of side 
effects from the articles, The Dallas Morning News reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two of the 10 articles paid for by Wyeth actually were  
published in medical journals before the company pulled the drugs 
from the market in September 1997, when studies linked the combo to 
heart valve damage and an often-fatal lung disease. Plans to 
publish the eight others were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Stunkard, of the University of Pennsylvania, said he had no idea  
that Wyeth financed or edited his article. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Wyeth, a division of American Home Products Corp.,  
defended the articles. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a common practice in the industry. It's not particular  
to us,'' Wyeth spokesman Doug Petkus said. ``The companies have 
some input, it seems, in the initial development of the piece ... 
but the proposed author has the last say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, medical ethicists and editors of prominent medical  
journals criticized the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're doing here is clearly an advertisement, but it's  
couched in a scientifically valid paper,'' said Dr. Robert Tenery 
Jr., a Dallas ophthalmologist and chairman of the American Medical 
Association's council on ethical and judicial affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The fen in fen-phen refers to Pondimin (fenfluramine) and Redux  
(dexfenfluramine), both sold by Wyeth. Phentermine, the other half 
of the combo, is not made by Wyeth and is still available. 
</P>
<P>
	Six million people in the United States took Pondimin or Redux.  
Individuals who took the weight-loss combo have filed thousands of 
lawsuits nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyeth and a company it acquired hired Excerpta Medica, Inc., to  
write the 10 articles, according to lawsuit documents cited by the 
Morning News. 
</P>
<P>
	Excerpta, based in Belle Mead, N.J., planned to submit most of  
the papers to medical journals owned by its parent company, Reed 
Elsevier Plc, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyeth officials reportedly said in depositions that the two  
published articles were reviewed for fairness by independent panels 
at the journals in which they appeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``The articles were not written with a slant toward selling the  
product,'' said Dr. Jo Alene Dolan, Wyeth's former associate 
director of clinical affairs, in a Jan. 15 deposition. ``The 
articles are written with fair balance.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Lower; Dow Down 35.10 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were falling broadly today amid weakness  
among Internet and bank shares as investors awaited the next 
indication of whether inflation is threatening the vibrant U.S. 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 35.10 at 10,794.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 6.70 at 1,323.59, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was down 37.51 at 2,482.63. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks led the Nasdaq's decline as investors shed some  
high-priced stocks in search of bargains among less well-known 
issues. Yahoo fell 8 1/8 to 143 3/16, and DoubleClick tumbled 9 3/4 to 
97 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank stocks, which typically suffer during periods of higher  
interest rates, were hit for a different reason today. Credit 
Suisse First Boston downgraded the group, citing concern about the 
banks' preparation for the Year 2000 computer bug. Citigroup fell 
2 1/2 to 65 5/16, and Chase Manhattan fell 2 11/16 to 76 1/4.

<P>
	Airline stocks fell after BT Alex Brown downgraded several  
carriers. Analyst Susan Donofrio said weak revenue trends and more 
expensive fuel should hamper results in the second half of 1999. 
AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, fell 1 1/16 to 65 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors spent last week on the sidelines, weighing the Federal  
Reserve's decision Tuesday to leave interest rates unchanged. But 
in determining that inflation is not currently enough of a threat 
to justify an increase in rates, Fed policy-makers also said they 
are ready to raise interest rates if inflation is rekindled. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, it appeared that investors are continuing their own  
watch. One bright sign was a weekend report that gasoline prices 
declined in the latest survey after a 2 1/2 month rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will report later this week on initial jobless  
claims, gross domestic product, personal income and spending, and 
traders are content to wait until at least one of those reports 
offers some answers to the lingering questions about inflation.

	Merger-and-acquisition activity was unusually quiet for a  
Monday. Cendant rose 1/8 to 19 5/16 after Avis Rent A Car agreed to

</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 210.5 million 
shares, well behind Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 2.26 to 634.61, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 3.26 to 798.63.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Finally Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- The 2 1/2-month climb in gasoline prices  
has reversed itself, dropping 1.57 cents per gallon nationwide 
since May 7, and is likely to keep falling, according to an 
industry analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	The high prices had been blamed on oil refining industry's  
decision to increase its supply of fuel for early summer driving, 
said Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 
gasoline stations. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday, the national weighted average, including all grades  
with taxes, was $1.218 per gallon, Ms. Lundberg said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time, what seems most likely is further drops in pump  
prices, pre-Memorial Day and beyond, but there are two unknowns: 
crude oil prices and extra strong gasoline demand,'' Ms. Lundberg 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first significant drop in prices since a 1 1/2 year  
slide in gasoline bottomed out at 99.8 cents per gallon average for 
all grades in mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
	A small rise in early March was followed by an 8 1/2 cent jump in  
mid-March due to higher crude oil prices, and the biggest jump of 
14 cents per gallon in early April. 
</P>
<P>
	The prices topped out at an average of $1.2337 two weeks ago -- a  
total rise of 23.5 cents nationwide in 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Friday's average was about 8 cents per gallon higher  
than late May of 1998, it was 7 cents lower than the same period in 
1997, Ms. Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	At self-service pumps, the average for regular unleaded on  
Friday was $1.1605, mid-grade gasoline averaged $1.2621 and premium 
$1.3469. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-service pump prices were $1.5318 for regular, $1.6191 for  
mid-grade and $1.6930 for premium, Ms. Lundberg said.

<HEADLINE> Tennis French Open Set To Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The glamor in tennis may belong to the likes of  
Martina Hingis, Venus and Serena Williams, and Anna Kournikova, but 
never count out Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario at the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Three times the champion and three times the runner-up, the  
27-year-old Spaniard still can run balls down all afternoon and, if 
need be, all evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, though, when she's swung with her two-fisted backhand,  
she's felt shivers of pain radiating from her left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the ligaments is out of position,'' the defending  
champion said Sunday as she prepared for her opening match against 
one of the strongest of the new generation of players, Mirjana 
Lucic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors told me the best thing to do is operate if I want  
to fix it. I'm trying not to do that, if I can help it. It's kind 
of like something is always turning around in my hand. It's a lot 
of pain when I want to hit my backhand hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Physical therapy is helping, and after missing more than three  
months, she's been able to play the past three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not 100 percent, but I'm optimistic,'' she said. ``I'm  
here. I'm the defending champion. I love the atmosphere, and I've 
always done well here. So I came here thinking that I'm going to 
try to win my fourth French Open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was only 17 when she won the French in 1989, beating Steffi  
Graf in the final and becoming the toast of Spain. One of the 
youngsters watching her and getting inspiration from that victory 
was a 12-year-old named Carlos Moya. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember that day,'' said Moya, who won the men's title last  
year and opens play on center court today against an Austrian he 
once met in the juniors, Markus Hipfl. ``It was a great day for the 
people in Spain. Graf was already so big, so nobody expected 
(Sanchez-Vicario) to win. I think she's been one of the greatest 
sportswomen ever in Spain. What she has done is amazing. She always 
gave 100 percent for her tennis, fighting so much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That style served not only Sanchez-Vicario well, but provided a  
model for a generation of Spanish men who have become a major force 
in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Moya expects his toughest challenges in the French this year to  
come not from the top-ranked players like Yevgeny Kafelnikov and 
Pete Sampras, but from the other Spaniards like No. 6 Alex 
Corretja, No. 14 Felix Mantilla, and unseeded Alberto Bersategui. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen of the 128 men in the draw are from Spain.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the toughest opponents are going to be Spanish players  
and (Chilean Marcelo) Rios and (Brazilian Gustavo) Kuerten,'' Moya 
said.

<HEADLINE> Wrestler Dies During WWF Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- This was not the first time that pro  
wrestler Owen Hart was making his entrance into the ring by being 
lowered from the rafters as the high-flying ``Blue Blazer,'' with 
the feathers of his sky-blue costume fluttering in the arena 
lights. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Sunday night, something went wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old member of a legendary Canadian wrestling family  
fell 90 feet from the ceiling of Kemper Arena. His head hit a 
padded turnbuckle, a metal coupling that holds the ring's ropes 
together, and snapped backward. He was pronounced dead at a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's death happened in front of 16,200 fans in the arena, and  
many thought the fall was part of the staged theatrics that have 
helped fuel the explosion of popularity in pro wrestling in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Wrestling Federation's pay-per-view national TV  
audience was watching archive footage and did not see Hart fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Homicide detectives on Monday were inspecting the rigging that  
was to lower Hart by cable from the arena catwalk and talking to 
the stagehands to determine what went wrong, police spokesman Floyd 
Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said the cable did not break, and detectives believe  
something went wrong when Hart's harness was being hitched to the 
cable. 
</P>
<P>
	WWF President Vince McMahon Jr. said he believes Hart may have  
accidentally pulled a release mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
	The WWF is one of the biggest draws on cable and pay-per-view  
TV, but critics say the matches often are sexist, homophobic and 
violent. The WWF admits its events are more entertainment than 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
	McMahon said WWF wrestlers will stop performing the aerial move  
that killed Hart, but said other stunts will continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stunts like this are performed at major sporting events on a  
routine basis in Hollywood,'' he said. ``We compete with Hollywood 
for entertainment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A WWF event went on as planned Monday night in St. Louis, where  
a crowd of 19,000 jammed the Kiel Center. A video montage dedicated 
to Hart and testimonials from other wrestlers were scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	But the WWF canceled plans to replay the tape of Sunday's  
pay-per-view program on Tuesday and Thursday. It also called off 
upcoming live events in Peoria, Ill.; Winnipeg, Manitoba; Hamilton, 
Ontario; Montreal and Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart was the youngest son of Stu Hart, a member of Canada's  
Olympic wrestling team in the 1940s. All seven of Stu Hart's sons 
went into wrestling, including Bret ``The Hitman'' Hart, a World 
Championship Wrestling star who canceled an appearance Monday on 
``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's mother, Helen, told the Calgary (Alberta) Herald that she  
always feared one of her sons would be disabled in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a dangerous sport in more ways than you can know,'' she  
said. ``I just never thought one of my boys would be killed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 feet 11 inches and 227 pounds, Hart was billed as an  
acrobatic stuntman who acted as a foil for WWF heavyweights. Hart 
had been a high-profile character when he broke into wrestling 10 
years ago, but he was recast as a plain, straightforward wrestler, 
in contrast to charismatic personalities such as ``Stone Cold'' 
Steve Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	``His shtick was he really didn't have one,'' said Dave Meltzer,  
editor of the Wrestling Observer newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart had been lowered by cable into the ring before, and other  
wrestlers have done it dozens of times, Meltzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some audience members initially thought the fall was part of the  
act. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it was a doll at first,'' said Robert McCome, 15.  
``We thought they were just playing with us. We were really shocked 
when we found out that it was no joke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While paramedics attended to Hart, the arena announcer haltingly  
told the hushed crowd the incident was not scripted. The event 
resumed about 15 minutes after he was taken away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was still tons of fun,'' said Barry Bickel, 21. ``But that  
just dampened the whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans watching on TV were told of Hart's death about an hour  
after it happened, Meltzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade Keller, editor of the Pro Wrestling Torch newsletter, said  
it was the first fatal accident he knew of in U.S. wrestling since 
1969, when Mike DiBiase died of a heart attack during a match in 
Lubbock, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Schmelzle, general manager of Kemper Arena, said the WWF  
asked him not to discuss the fall. Local stagehands assisted on the 
catwalk, but WWF employees were in charge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, a former WWF wrestler, called the  
Harts ``a legendary family of wrestling'' and said Hart's death was 
a reminder that wrestling is a tough job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe people ought to start thinking about respecting them a  
little more,'' Ventura said. ``These performers give their heart 
and soul to their job.''

<HEADLINE> Court OKs Juries for Land-Use Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People who invoke a much-used civil rights law  
and sue in federal court over local governmental land-use 
regulations can get a jury trial -- not just one before a judge, the 
Supreme Court ruled today as it upheld a $1.45 million award 
against the city of Monterey, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, by a 5-4 vote, upheld the legal victory of a  
former owner of 37 oceanfront acres in a case that has been watched 
closely by property-rights advocates nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's splintered decision did not give property owners the  
right to a jury trial in all such cases. But Justice Anthony M. 
Kennedy, writing the court's main opinion, said the Seventh 
Amendment right to a jury trial must win out sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not attempt a precise demarcation of the respective  
provinces of judge and jury in determining whether a zoning 
decision substantially advances legitimate governmental 
interests,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and  
Justices John Paul Stevens and Clarence Thomas. Justice Antonin 
Scalia, although he did not join Kennedy's opinion in its entirety, 
voted for the same result. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices David H. Souter, Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader  
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer dissented. 
</P>
<P>
	The future importance of the ruling is unclear. Such lawsuits  
now routinely are filed in state courts, where jury trials are 
available in land-condemnation cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision appeared to offer little clear guidance for the  
nation's courts on how to handle cases in which the local, state or 
federal government does not take possession of private property but 
restricts its use. 
</P>
<P>
	Government has the power, called eminent domain, to buy private  
property for a public purpose as long as it pays the owner a fair 
price, what the Constitution's Fifth Amendment calls ``just 
compensation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And 19 years ago, the Supreme Court first ruled that some  
regulatory limits on land are severe enough to amount to a 
``taking'' that also requires just compensation. Such ``inverse 
condemnation'' disputes have been an ideological battleground ever 
since, with champions of property rights squared off against 
environmentalists and other opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury ruled that Monterey had violated a landowner's  
equal-protection rights and that its land-use restrictions, which 
for years blocked development of a residential complex on the 
property known as Del Monte Dunes, amounted to a taking. 
</P>
<P>
	The city had disallowed development because the area has natural  
buckwheat plants, the only known habitat of the Smith Blue 
Butterfly, an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it was disputed whether any such butterfly actually  
lived on the property, federal Fish and Wildlife Service agents 
said development of the 37 acres would have a devastating effect on 
that species. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the former property owner, however, said city  
officials had engaged in a ``pattern of abuse'' to ``protect a 
butterfly that nobody's ever seen there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city required that about 18 acres of the land be left as  
open public space, and another eight acres be left open as private 
landscaped areas. About seven acres were to be used for public and 
private streets. The city eventually decided that the remaining 
acreage could not be developed because it was home to buckwheat 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a five-year period, city officials rejected five different  
development plans for the land. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal jury's award against Monterey was upheld by the 9th  
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that 
inverse-condemnation lawsuits filed under a much-used civil rights 
law are entitled to jury trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Supreme Court said the appeals court was right.  
</P>
<P>
	Del Monte Dunes at Monterey Ltd. eventually sold its 37 acres  
for more money than it had paid for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Monterey vs. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, 97-1235.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Commits to Move to NY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton says she will definitely  
make her home in New York after leaving the White House, whether or 
not she runs for the Senate here. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady made the commitment during a ``60 Minutes II''  
interview after being asked which New York baseball team she would 
root for. 
</P>
<P>
	``The politic answer, since I do plan to live in New York no  
matter what I end up doing, is I'll root for both,'' she said in 
the interview, which was taped May 20 and will air Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS spokesman Kevin Tedesco said there was no significance to  
her use of the word ``I'' rather than ``we'' since she used ``we,'' 
clearly including the president in her plans, in other parts of the 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsha Berry, the first lady's spokeswoman, said Mrs. Clinton  
``and the president have discussed that they would like to live in 
New York, long before she was approached about this race.'' Berry 
said those discussions had been going on ``for over a year now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has not yet announced whether she will seek the  
Senate seat being vacated by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. She 
appeared in New York City on Monday at a fund-raiser for Rep. Nita 
Lowey, D-N.Y., who will run for the Senate if the first lady does 
not. Mrs. Clinton made no reference to her impending decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lowey highlighted her solidarity with Mrs. Clinton,  
betraying no bitterness that her own political future might be hurt 
as she awaits the first lady's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let the governor and the mayor have their petty feuds,'' Mrs.  
Lowey said. ``While the Republicans in this state turn their backs 
on one another, I am proud to march forward shoulder-to-shoulder 
with my friend Hillary Rodham Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lowey's comments about the Republicans refer to New York  
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has formed an exploratory campaign 
committee for the Senate seat, and Gov. George Pataki. On Monday, 
Pataki said he had no intention of running for the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Asia Economy Recovering Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Companies in the crisis-stricken economies of Asia  
are recovering more quickly than expected, but investors should 
avoid growing too optimistic too soon, World Bank officials said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The outlook for Asian companies in the year ahead depends on  
implementing financial and corporate sector restructuring that 
combats the causes of the nearly two-year-old turmoil, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Recovery is proceeding in some countries and in some sectors  
even more rapidly than the firms thought would be the case a few 
months ago,'' said Francis Colaco, president of Asia-Pacific 
Management Consultants Inc. and a consultant to the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, there was growing optimism among South Korean  
firms, which have done more to cut bloated work forces and reform 
their operations than companies elsewhere, said Dominique 
Dwor-Frecaut, a senior economist for the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials spoke at a press conference in Tokyo.  
</P>
<P>
	Their conclusions are based on a World Bank survey of 4,000  
companies in South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia and 
Thailand between November 1998 and February 1999. The results were 
first presented in Bangkok last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent rallies in Asian stocks have been seen as a sign of  
recovery. But World Bank officials warned against growing too 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are talking about a spectacular recovery only in asset  
markets and stock markets, but these markets are very small,'' 
Dwor-Frecaut said. ``You need only a very small capital flow to 
have a very big impact on these markets one way or the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To ensure a full recovery, the countries should strengthen laws  
on bankruptcy and mergers so resources are transferred quickly from 
failed companies to healthy ones, the World Bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	The countries should also develop their stock and bond markets  
so companies have sources of funding other than bank loans. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea's economy is expected to grow about 2 percent this  
year, compared with a 5.5 percent contraction in 1998, according to 
a recent report from the International Monetary Fund. The 
Philippines and Malaysia are also likely to grow this year, 
although at modest rates.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Isringhausen Back on Roster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jason Isringhausen, who missed all of last  
season because of an elbow injury, will make his first major-league 
start since 1997 when he pitches for the New York Mets at 
Pittsburgh on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen, 26, was considered a top pitching prospect for the  
team and went 9-2 with a 2.81 ERA as a rookie in 1995. He last 
pitched for the Mets September 23, 1997, also against the Pirates 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In eight starts for the Mets Triple-A affiliate at Norfolk of  
the International League this season, Isringhausen is 3-1 with a 
2.53 ERA and has 47 strikeouts in 46 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen has had his once-promising career slowed by a  
succession of injuries including a broken wrist in 1997, 
arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder and elbow in 1996, and 
reconstructive surgery on his right elbow last season. He also 
battled through a 1997 bout with tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen has been recalled in order to give starters Al  
Leiter and Bobby Jones a few days extra to rest. Jones has 
tightness in his right shoulder and Leiter has been pitching with a 
sprained left knee.

<HEADLINE> Quiet Primary in Kentucky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- When Kentucky voters decided their state  
officers should be allowed to serve more than one term, supporters 
argued it would reduce the turmoil of a statehouse turnover every 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	It has worked beyond expectations.  
</P>
<P>
	Incumbent Democratic Gov. Paul Patton is unopposed in Tuesday's  
primary election and little more than token Republican and 
independent opposition loom in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Running against nobody, I think I can win that one,'' Patton  
joked. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the first governor in nearly two centuries eligible for  
re-election. The state's first constitution allowed it and James 
Garrard served two terms from 1796 to 1804. 
</P>
<P>
	Governors were later barred from seeking re-election, but voters  
changed the constitution in 1992 to allow succession in 
constitutional offices beginning after the 1995 election. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, no Republicans filed for any constitutional office  
except governor, virtually guaranteeing a second term for the three 
of four other Democratic incumbents who are seeking re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the governor's race, even GOP leaders acknowledge they  
are sitting out this election for all intents and purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Die-hard Republicans -- some 834,829 registered voters -- do have  
some choice: Peppy Martin and running mate Wanda Cornelius, and the 
husband-and-wife slate of David L. Williams and Joanna Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin is a publicist who served for a few months as a secretary  
in the last Republican administration in Kentucky -- in 1971 -- and 
unsuccessfully sought the GOP nomination for state representative 
in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who calls herself ``a very Kentucky girl,'' has  
criticized Patton for raising the subject of casino gambling and 
overhauling the state workers' compensation system. She tried to 
associate Patton with President Clinton's efforts to regulate 
tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	But what drew the most attention to her campaign was the work of  
some computer hackers earlier this month. Her Web site was 
sabotaged and altered to present bogus positions on gay rights and 
gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	It was by far the most publicity for a candidate who has raised  
less than $10,000 and found her running mate only two weeks before 
the filing deadline at a Federation of Republican Women meeting. 
And Cornelius has said she wouldn't have entered the race if she 
had known she would have to resign from the Taylor County school 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the other GOP candidate, is a former utility  
contractor who is disabled from throat cancer and speaks only with 
the aid of a mechanical device. He has spent only $796 on the 
campaign -- $500 of that was his filing fee -- and has disconnected 
his telephone and refused interview requests. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the fall campaign, Gatewood Galbraith, who has lost two  
previous tries for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination on a 
platform that included legalization for hemp, has registered as an 
independent and is expected to file this summer.

<HEADLINE>  Tyson Released From Maryland Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A beaming Mike Tyson walked out of a suburban  
Maryland jail Monday after serving less than a quarter of his 
one-year sentence for assaulting two motorists after a 
fender-bender. 
</P>
<P>
	``His release was long overdue, as far as I'm concerned,'' his  
attorney, Paul Kemp, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson left the Rockville, Md., jail where he spent the past 3 1/2  
months wearing a white T-shirt, gray sweatpants and prison-issue 
sandals. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion smiled but said nothing to  
reporters outside the jail. Tyson and a friend got into a car where 
his wife, Monica, waited to take him home to change clothes before 
meeting with his Maryland probation officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's release came hours after an Indiana judge announced her  
decision to end Tyson's probation for a 1992 rape conviction. The 
Maryland Parole Commission voted 5-1 on Friday to grant Tyson's 
release, but Indiana authorities needed to approve the decision 
before Tyson could go home. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson will be on parole until February, said Leonard A. Sipes, a  
spokesman for the Maryland Department of Public Safety and 
Correctional Services. He also must meet certain probation 
conditions -- including 200 hours of community service -- during the 
next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson will be subject to urine testing at least twice a week and  
unannounced home visits by state authorities, Sipes said. He must 
also receive permission before leaving Maryland, complete a 
psychiatric evaluation and undergo anger management treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelley Finkel, Tyson's manager, said he will ``have to sit down  
and talk with Mike about his boxing plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought Tyson might fight this year, Finkel said,  
``I haven't seen any reason for him not to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Kemp, the boxer's attorney, said Tyson's first priority is  
to ``try and relax and be with his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all that he's been looking forward to for the past 3 1/2  
months,'' Kemp said. ``Careerwise, there's talk about trying to 
resume his career -- that is to think about tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has three fights remaining on a deal with the MGM Grand in  
Las Vegas and at least three more fights with Showtime, the cable 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old boxer last fought Jan. 16 and was behind on all  
three cards before he knocked out Francois Botha in the fifth round 
at Las Vegas. That fight was Tyson's first after getting back his 
boxing license. Nevada boxing authorities revoked the license on 
Oct. 19 after Tyson was disqualified for biting Evander Holyfield's 
ears on June 28, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault charges stemming  
from a minor traffic accident in suburban Gaithersburg, Md. He was 
sentenced on Feb. 5 to one year in a Montgomery County jail, but 
another 60 days were added as punishment for violating probation on 
his rape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	In her ruling, Superior Court Judge Patricia Gifford of Marion  
County, Ind., said the jail time Tyson had served in Maryland 
satisfied the penalty he incurred for violating terms of his 
Indiana probation.

<HEADLINE> Pataki Backs Bush for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shelving his own presidential ambitions, Gov.  
George Pataki threw his political muscle today behind Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush's all-but-declared run for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is an inclusive Republican who has reached out with his  
doctrine of compassionate conservativism and in the process built a 
party that has supported him with overwhelming votes from the 
Hispanic community, from women, from African-Americans across 
Texas,'' Pataki said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement, three weeks in the making, included a live  
satellite hookup with Bush, who told Pataki, ``I'm honored to have 
you on my team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen other GOP governors have already lined up behind Bush  
and pressure had been mounting on Pataki, even from some New York 
Republicans, to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki had been seeking to raise his profile nationally with a  
series of out-of-state political trips. On one such trip to New 
Hampshire, Pataki had said he planned to consider running for the 
GOP presidential nomination. But the possibility of a Pataki 
presidential run seemed to generate little excitement. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki is still a potential GOP vice presidential candidate for  
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation over what Pataki was going to announce included  
rumors that Pataki would seek the Senate seat now held by the 
retiring Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the latter possibility today, Pataki said, ``I've  
been in politics long enough to know you never say never but let me 
make it very clear I have no intention of running for the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would back the Republican candidate, whether that  
would be Rep. Rick Lazio, who was invited to today's announcement, 
or New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani --who was not. Pataki and 
Giuliani have had chilly relations and have clashed in recent weeks 
over a proposal to cut a city tax on suburban commuters. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Democratic side, Hillary Rodham Clinton is eyeing the New  
York Senate race.

<HEADLINE> Mail to Some Countries To Cost More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sending packages abroad will cost more  
starting Sunday, although postage for letters will be unchanged for 
most of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Many international postal rates are being increased in the first  
rise since 1995, the Postal Service said. Domestic postal rates 
went up in January, increasing the price of a first-class letter a 
penny to 33 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	The new international rates will boost the price of a letter to  
Canada from 46 cents to 48 cents for the first half-ounce and 55 
cents for a full ounce, up from 52 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Rates for Mexico will remain unchanged at 40 cents for a  
half-ounce and 46 cents for an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Letters to all other countries also will remain at the current  
rate of 60 cents for a half-ounce and $1 for an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	The Postal Service is increasing charges for most other  
categories of international mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of sending an international post card will go up a  
nickel to 40 cents for Mexico, 45 cents for Canada and 50 cents for 
all other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	And the popular aerogrammes -- single sheets of paper folded to  
form their own envelope -- will now be 60 cents, up a dime. Their 
rate is the same for all foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Global priority mail, with a 4-pound limit, will increase from  
$3.75 to $4 for a small envelope and from $6.95 to $7 for a large 
one headed for Western Europe, the Middle East, Canada and Mexico. 
For the Pacific rim and South America, the rate will rise from 
$4.95 to $5 for a small envelope and from $8.95 to $9 for a large 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	Express mail will go up about 1.9 percent overall on rates that  
vary by place and size. 
</P>
<P>
	Postal officials said increases will be ordered for the lower  
weights of parcel post, but postage will be decreased for larger 
packages. Those rates also vary considerably by size and 
destination.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Court's Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	From the Supreme Court's unanimous decision Monday in a Maryland  
case that said police violate people's privacy rights when they 
bring the news media into homes while they make arrests or conduct 
searches: 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist:  
</P>
<P>
	The Fourth Amendment embodies this centuries-old principle of  
respect for the privacy of the home. ... Here, of course, the 
officers ... were undoubtedly entitled to enter the Wilson home in 
order to execute the arrest warrant for Dominic Wilson. But it does 
not necessarily follow that they were entitled to bring a newspaper 
reporter and a photographer with them. ... 
</P>
<P>
	(The police) argue that the presence of the Washington Post  
reporters in the Wilsons' home nonetheless served a number of 
legitimate law enforcement purposes. ... But this claim ignores the 
importance of the right of residential privacy at the core of the 
Fourth Amendment. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It may well be that media ride-alongs further law enforcement  
objectives of the police in a general sense, but that is not the 
same as furthering the purposes of the search. ... Surely the 
possibility of good public relations for the police is simply not 
enough, standing alone, to justify the ride-long intrusion into a 
private home. And even the need for accurate reporting on police 
issues in general bears no direct relation to the constitutional 
justification for the police intrusion into a home in order to 
execute a felony arrest warrant. ... 
</P>
<P>
	A private photographer was acting for private purposes, as  
evidenced in part by the fact that the newspaper and not the police 
retained the photographs. ... We hold that it is a violation of the 
Fourth Amendment for police to bring members of the media or other 
third parties into a home during the execution of a warrant when 
the presence of the third parties in the home was not in aid of the 
execution of the warrant.

<HEADLINE> A Hollywood Plan for the NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Leave it to Hollywood to bedazzle NFL owners.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael Ovitz, the show business agent who heads one of two  
groups bidding for the new Los Angeles franchise, has a plan for 
the Los Angeles Coliseum that includes everything from a parking 
garage covered with trees, grass in front of luxury suites and even 
a cooling system that would spray mist on fans in hot weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, first reported Sunday in the Los Angeles Times, will  
be presented to the owners at their spring meetings Tuesday and 
Wednesday. League officials confirmed the newspaper report that the 
plan had impressed most of the owners who had seen it. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day meeting will be involved primarily with settling  
some of the NFL's franchise issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners are expected to approve the sale of the Washington  
Redskins to Daniel Snyder for $800 million. Snyder was a member of 
the group headed by Howard Milstein that withdrew after it became 
apparent the owners wouldn't approve it. 
</P>
<P>
	They also are expected to discuss the New England Patriots'  
decision to stay in the Boston area after withdrawing a commitment 
they had made to Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	But Los Angeles may be the most pressing issue.  
</P>
<P>
	At the March meetings, the league tentatively awarded Los  
Angeles the 32nd franchise over Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	But the NFL told the California city that it needed to come up  
with a viable plan by September. And there still are two groups 
vying for the franchise -- one headed by Ovitz and the other by real 
estate moguls Eli Broad and Ed Roski. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL already has chosen the Coliseum, the Roski-Broad site,  
as the setting for the new stadium. But Ovitz's plan may give his 
group the edge in getting the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal, designed by architect David Rockwell, is called  
``The Coliseum at Exposition Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking Central Park here and a unique recreation  
environment with the stadium standing as a monument in the 
middle,'' the Times quoted an unidentified NFL official as saying. 
``It just blew everyone away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't guarantee Ovitz will get the franchise, which would  
replace the Rams and Raiders, who defected to St. Louis and Oakland 
after the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broad-Roski group claims to hold a special right to bring  
the NFL back to the Coliseum. If the owners decide on Ovitz's plan, 
their claim could hurt Los Angeles' chance of meeting the Sept. 15 
deadline set to the owners. 
</P>
<P>
	League officials also have said if Los Angeles seemed close to a  
new plan, it might be considered to have met the deadline.

<HEADLINE> NASA Begins Shuttle Countdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- With the U.S. space industry's  
confidence shaken by the worst string of rocket failures in years, 
NASA began the countdown Monday for the first shuttle launch in six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the longest gap between space shuttle launches since the  
Challenger disaster -- something that has heightened the anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery is set to lift off Thursday morning with 1 1/2 tons of  
computers, clothes, cranes and other gear for the new international 
space station, which is under construction in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuttle workers said they can't help thinking about the six  
botched rocket launches since last summer that have destroyed or 
stranded satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though NASA has practiced hard since the last shuttle  
flight in December -- conducting mock countdowns and scrutinizing 
procedures -- the question in the back of everyone's minds is: Was 
anything missed? 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see on launch day,'' said shuttle processing director  
Dave King. ``But I think we've done everything we can possibly do 
to get this team ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian delays in completing a key space station component and  
problems with a NASA X-ray telescope that was supposed to be put 
into orbit earlier this spring combined to create the six-month gap 
between shuttle flights. The shuttle fleet was grounded for more 
than 2 1/2 years following the 1986 Challenger accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery's commander, Kent Rominger, said the space shuttle is  
like a plane: It needs to fly to shake out any problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst thing you can do with an airplane is to leave it  
sitting around for days, weeks, months,'' said Rominger, a Navy 
pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Rominger also warned that the longer the lull, the greater the  
sense of urgency to launch. As the man ultimately responsible for 
the safety of his six crewmates, he said he has made it clear to 
higher-ups: ``Hey, we need to make sure we do things right like we 
always did and not get caught up in the fervor of the launch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since August, two rockets have exploded on liftoff, three more  
have dumped satellites in useless orbits, and another dragged a 
satellite back down through the atmosphere, where it burned up. The 
losses totaled $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time so many rockets failed in such quick succession  
was in the mid-1980s. The toll included Challenger. 
</P>
<P>
	The accidents have left NASA's space shuttle fleet with the best  
launch record among the nation's major players: 92 successes and 
one failure, for a 98.9 percent success rate. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton last week ordered an investigation into the  
six failures. While most of the accidents are still under review, 
investigators suspect sloppiness may have contributed to some of 
the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the rocket failures was NASA's fault. Three of the  
rockets were launched by the Air Force, and three by aerospace 
companies. But the same two contractors that built the rockets -- 
Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. -- also prepare NASA's space 
shuttles for launch. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's King said that despite the shift of more and more  
responsibility from the government to aerospace contractors to save 
money, the space agency maintains close oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are problems, I think we would see them,'' King said.  
``So I don't think you can compare the two. They're totally 
different hardware, totally different programs.''

<HEADLINE> Surprising Sixers Set Foundation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- No one is doubting the sportsmanship of the  
Indiana Pacers. Still, there might have been another reason to 
dismiss the Philadelphia 76ers with hugs and pleasantries after 
sweeping them out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Bird and Reggie Miller know that you don't anger an  
opponent, no matter how easily vanquished, because he might come 
back to haunt you someday. 
</P>
<P>
	Such is the surprising, promising state of the Sixers.  
</P>
<P>
	A franchise that has suffered inordinately for the better part  
of a decade, and still carries the ugly stain of the NBA's worst 
record ever in 1972-73, suddenly is emerging as the team to watch 
in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sixers' accomplishments under the sometimes rocky  
stewardship of Allen Iverson and coach Larry Brown were perhaps 
best captured in the closing seconds of their 89-86 loss Sunday to 
the Pacers. For starters, the Sixers got swept 4-0 in a playoff 
series and received a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	In Philadelphia, that never happens.  
</P>
<P>
	``We accomplished a lot,'' said Iverson, who won the NBA scoring  
title and grew up immeasurably during Philadelphia's first winning 
season since 1990-91. ``It was exciting for the fans and for us. 
People appreciated it, and we appreciated their support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Where do the young Sixers go from here? In the eyes of the  
aging, powerful team that beat them, nowhere but up. 
</P>
<P>
	``This should be a great experience for them,'' said Bird, the  
Pacers' coach and winner of three NBA titles as a player with the 
Boston Celtics. ``Larry Brown has done a terrific job with them and 
Allen Iverson is a great player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was never a given that Brown and Iverson would be able to put  
aside their differences in the name of winning. Brown's marvelous 
track record for reviving dead franchises was well documented, as 
was Iverson's habit of letting his talent get sidetracked by 
competing interests pulling him in all the wrong directions. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson and Brown feuded again this season, Brown's second in  
Philadelphia, when Iverson took exception to a benching during an 
April 2 game against Cleveland. But instead of withdrawing, Iverson 
quickly apologized and vowed to make amends with Brown. He won his 
first scoring title, but not at the team's peril. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson told some friends who have caused trouble for him in the  
past that he won't tolerate it any more. No longer paranoid about 
his celebrity status or fearful of enemies, he even fired his 
bodyguard, Terry Royster, last week. That's a savings of $100,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``His growth has been the most significant thing about the whole  
year,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the reason for any success we're having,'' Iverson said  
of his coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sixers, in the playoffs for the first time since 1991, did  
much more than advance to the second round. They got the jaded fans 
of Philadelphia to enjoy the ride. 
</P>
<P>
	The First Union Center, previously pulsing with boos and  
profanity for the home team, was transformed into a raucous arena 
with one of the toughest home-court advantages in the league. 
Miller said Indiana fans, who epitomize basketball hysteria, ``need 
to take a good example from Philadelphia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All too often in the Sixers' rocky recent past, Philadelphia has  
been the land of bad examples. 
</P>
<P>
	But the buzz around town during the playoff drive was that  
attending a Sixers game was like watching college basketball. In 
fact, in the immediate circle of Sixers goings-on, the team took on 
the strange aura of a high school team. The players' parents, 
starting with Iverson's mother, Ann, clamored for attention. Matt 
Geiger's father, Dick, offered opinions about ``the guys,'' which 
ended up in the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	But now that the ride is over, reality sets in. Better results  
are expected next time. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson will be older and wiser, turning 24 a week from Monday.  
High-flying rookie Larry Hughes will be 21 a few weeks before the 
All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sixers have no first-round draft picks and no salary cap  
room. So general manager Billy King is scanning rosters for a small 
forward with shooting ability and the desire to play for the middle 
class exception, $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to win a championship,'' team president Pat Croce  
said. ``And I will do everything in my power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, reason to look forward to next year.

<HEADLINE> FAA Orders Wiring Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration ordered  
inspections on electrical wiring found in the fuel tanks of Boeing 
727s Monday, and directed aircraft operators to wrap all the wires 
with an extra layer of Teflon. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA had promised such a directive over the weekend, after  
ordering emergency tests on the tubes that carry the electric 
wires. 
</P>
<P>
	Its order Monday requires 727 operators to remove wire bundles  
from the fuel tanks, inspect them for any chafing and replace them 
as needed. All the wires must also be wrapped with an additional 
protective layer of Teflon. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA provided a timeline requiring planes with more than  
30,000 flight hours to complete the inspections and Teflon wrapping 
within 30 days. Planes under that mark have until they reach 30,000 
flight hours to perform the inspection and wrap the wires. 
</P>
<P>
	The order affects 1,051 Boeing 727s in the United States, and  
the FAA anticipated that the cost of the inspection and Teflon 
wrapping would be about $757,000 for the entire fleet. Each 
aircraft will require about 12 employee hours to conduct the 
inspections and wrap the wiring, the FAA predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Worried that a mixture of fuel, air and electricity could spark  
an explosion, the FAA issued its directive after workers found 
severe wear on wires and holes in the tubing on two of the jets. 
Mechanics also discovered wear on wiring used to power in-tank fuel 
pumps and signs of electric arcing. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA ordered inspections last May of a similar area of the  
727's cousin, the Boeing 737.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Investors Getting Scammed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the hottest new investment scams  
involves people who think they can earn money by helping terminally 
ill people get an early payoff on their life insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors buy the policies through a broker and a portion of the  
money is paid to the policyholder, who often has AIDS or cancer, to 
help with medical bills. The investor is supposed to get paid when 
the person dies, but in some cases, the policyholders aren't really 
dying. In other cases, the policyholder doesn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
	State securities regulators added the scams Monday to their  
annual list of the ``top ten'' investment frauds. Also added were 
high-priced seminars in ``day trading,'' in which inexperienced 
investors are convinced they can get rich quick by rapid-fire 
buying and selling of stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we have an ideal climate for fraud,'' said Peter  
Hildreth, president of the North American Securities Administrators 
Association, and director of securities regulation in New 
Hampshire. ``Millions of new investors, many of whom expect 
unrealistically high returns, are looking for places to put their 
money. At the same time we're living through an Internet-driven 
technology revolution that is a boon to investors and con artists 
alike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investing in insurance policies of the terminally ill is legal,  
and has been around for a decade. Advocates call it viatical 
investing, which takes its name from the Latin ``viaticum'' -- a 
purse given to a traveler in preparation for a journey. 
</P>
<P>
	Viatical companies arrange for the sales of the policies and  
take a share of the proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	As an example, a group of investors may pay a terminally ill  
person $80,000 for the person's $100,000 life insurance policy. 
When the person dies, the group will make a $20,000 profit, minus 
premiums and fees to the viatical broker. 
</P>
<P>
	While many brokers operate legally, the practice isn't  
regulated, which ``creates a situation that could be ripe for 
fraud,'' said Scott Lane, assistant enforcement director of 
Pennsylvania's Securities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Gloria Wolk, an expert cited by Lane, estimates that investors  
have lost more than $400 million in viatical investments since the 
industry sprouted in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Warner, a retired plant worker living in Independence,  
Mo., and his mother lost a combined $16,000 on their $45,000 
investment made with a viatical company based in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	About two years after investing, Warner says, they suddenly  
received settlement checks for some $29,000. The company told them 
the policyholders were living longer than anticipated and their 
insurance premiums had to be paid -- an issue Warner said had never 
been raised before. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here we end up stuck with the lack of someone else's  
responsibility,'' Warner said in a telephone interview. He's not 
convinced the ill policyholders ever really existed. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators have taken enforcement actions against the  
company and several others. 
</P>
<P>
	One problem occurs when people who aren't really sick take out  
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, Lane said, people can get life insurance policies  
worth as much as $100,000 without medical exams or blood tests. 
</P>
<P>
	In other cases, the viatical company promises big returns of 25  
percent or more to investors, but never has any insurance policies 
to back them up. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when someone is terminally ill, the state securities  
regulators caution, viatical investing is risky because of the 
uncertainty in predicting when the person will die. New AIDS drugs 
have compounded the risk for investors because they keep people 
with AIDS alive longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Rhoades, a vice president of the National Viatical  
Association, said fraud is not widespread in the $1 billion-a-year 
industry. She said it has occurred in a few instances, as happens 
``in any other industry that is unregulated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe it should be regulated,'' Ms. Rhoades said, noting  
that the trade group has been working to that end with the National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners.

<HEADLINE> 'Star Wars' Falls Short of Record / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Phantom Menace'' attracted fans in  
record numbers, yet proved no match for dinosaurs in the battle for 
the best ever weekend box office. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-awaited return of the ``Star Wars'' space opera grossed  
$61.8 million its first weekend, falling far short of the record 
$72.1 million debut of ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park,'' estimates 
showed. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its release Wednesday, the ``The Phantom Menace'' prequel  
amassed $102.8 million, a spectacular number for any other film, 
but short of some expectations: Several movie analysts had 
predicted a five-day gross of $120 million to $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, while it settled for No. 2 all-time record for a  
Friday-to-Sunday opening weekend, ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The 
Phantom Menace'' shattered a number of other records. 
</P>
<P>
	It had the highest single-day and opening-day grosses -- $28.5  
million on Wednesday -- and became the fastest movie to reach $100 
million -- five days, versus six for ``Lost World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Phantom Menace'' set these marks, which are not adjusted  
for inflation, even though it didn't open on a holiday weekend, as 
event pictures usually do. ``Lost World,'' for instance, set the 
three-day opening weekend record over the Memorial Day holiday in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Sherak, distribution head for 20th Century Fox, said the  
strategy was to release ``The Phantom Menace'' in midweek to first 
accommodate the hardcore fans -- who would watch it any time, 
anywhere -- and then make room for regular movie-goers to see it 
over the weekend or the Memorial Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we wanted to set the record we would have released the  
picture next week,'' said Sherak. ``This wasn't about the records. 
This picture would have set any early record it wanted to set. It 
was never planned like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sherak added that some fans may also have been scared away by  
reports of long lines and unavailability of tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is exactly what we were worried about,'' he said. ``Our  
concern is that people think they can't get in, but they can. There 
are tickets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After opening with the record-breaking $28.5 million Wednesday,  
``The Phantom Menace'' dropped to $12.3 million Thursday, recovered 
a little to $18.4 million Friday, then packed in audiences Saturday 
with $24.2 million, among the biggest single-day grosses in 
history. Sunday's gross was estimated at $19.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three-day movie weekend, the film had a stunning  
per-location average of $20,808, an amount usually only recorded by 
popular art house films playing in a couple of theaters. ``The 
Phantom Menace'' is in 2,970 locations. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line was that expectations were probably so high for  
this movie, suggested Paul Dergarabedian, of box office tracker 
Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., that ``The Phantom Menace'' could 
never have met all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are terrific numbers,'' he said. ``But the bar has been  
raised. At one time these numbers would be considered just 
unbelievable or not even imaginable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only other big film opening last weekend, ``The Love  
Letter,'' struggled to find an audience, despite being released as 
a romantic alternative. It debuted with $2.6 million for fifth 
place over the Friday to Sunday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The strongest movie against ``The Phantom Menace'' was ``The  
Mummy,'' dropping 47 percent in its third week to $13.1 million for 
the weekend -- or about what ``Phantom'' did on its worst day. 
``Entrapment'' was third with $5.8 million and ``The Matrix'' 
fourth with $2.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., with final 
figures to be released today: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' $61.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``The Mummy,'' $13.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Entrapment,'' $5.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``The Matrix,'' $2.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``The Love Letter,'' $2.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' $2.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Never Been Kissed,'' $1.55 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. (tie) ``Black Mask,'' $1.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. (tie) ``Life'' $1.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. (tie) ``Election,'' $1.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. (tie) ``Trippin,'' $1.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Mike Tyson Cleared for Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mike Tyson moved a step closer to freedom  
when an Indiana judge said today she was ending his probation for a 
1992 rape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion is awaiting release from a jail  
in Rockville, Md., by June 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Jail spokesman Eric Seleznow said Tyson will be free to leave  
once the Maryland Parole Commission authorizes his release. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana action was approved Friday by Marion Superior Court  
Judge Patricia Gifford. However, it was not announced until today 
by Becky Wagner, the judge's assistant chief clerk. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was granted parole in Maryland on Friday. Indiana  
authorities needed to approve the decision before Tyson would be 
allowed to go home for the first time since he was sentenced Feb. 
5. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson manager Shelley Finkel said today he'll ``have to sit down  
and talk with Mike about his boxing plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought Tyson might fight this year, Finkel said,  
``I haven't seen any reason for him not to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has three fights remaining on a deal with the MGM Grand in  
Las Vegas and at least three more fights with Showtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old boxer last fought Jan. 16 and he was behind on  
all three cards before he stopped Francois Botha in the fifth round 
at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner said Gifford and Tyson's lawyers had agreed that the jail  
time already served by Tyson in Maryland for an assault conviction 
satisfied the penalty he incurred for violating terms of his 
Indiana probation for the rape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement releasing Tyson from his Indiana probation was  
struck originally in March by Gifford, Tyson's probation officer 
and his Indianapolis lawyer, James Voyles. 
</P>
<P>
	That agreement allowed Tyson to be released from probation after  
he served his 30-day jail sentence in Maryland, Wagner said. No 
additional hearing was needed on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Voyles refused to comment on the probation today, referring  
questions to the document signed in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maryland Parole Commission voted 5-1 Friday to grant Tyson's  
release. Had Tyson served out his term, he would have been placed 
immediately on probation rather than on the stricter terms of 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
	With good behavior, Tyson would have been released from jail in  
September had he not been granted parole. He will now be on parole 
until September, followed by two years' probation that includes 200 
hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault charges  
following a minor traffic accident in suburban Gaithersburg, Md., 
in August. He was sentenced to one year in the Montgomery County 
jail, and 60 days were later added as punishment for violating 
probation for the 1992 rape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was tentatively scheduled to fight again April 24 against  
an undetermined opponent, but his jail sentence prevented that. 
</P>
<P>
	The Botha fight was Tyson's first since his license was restored  
by Nevada boxing authorities on Oct. 19. The license had been 
revoked after he was disqualified for biting Evander Holyfield ears 
June 28, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Finalists Picked for 'Maglev' Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A magnetic levitation train that can reach  
speeds of up to 310 mph moved toward reality Monday with the 
selection of project finalists in seven states. 
</P>
<P>
	A project in one of the states -- Maryland, California, Florida,  
Georgia, Louisiana, Nevada or Pennsylvania -- will be picked next 
year for development and construction. Transportation Secretary 
Rodney Slater announced $12 million in grants to study the seven 
``maglev'' projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other proposed projects -- one each in Colorado and Virginia  
and two in Alabama -- were rejected for unspecified reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents billed the technology as offering relief for  
congested highways and airports. The trains, using electromagnetic 
forces to lift the train above ground and free it of speed-reducing 
friction, could run about three times the speed of conventional 
trains. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every great accomplishment was first and for a period of time  
a dream,'' Slater said at the B&AMP;O Railroad Museum, with vintage 
locomotives and boxcars serving as a backdrop. ``I'm delighted to 
give fire to this dream, this thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maglev systems are already being tested in Germany and Japan,  
but no such system is in commercial service anywhere in the world. 
Critics say that while the technology works in test settings, many 
questions remain over full-scale operations and costs. 
</P>
<P>
	A transportation law last year authorized $1 billion to build  
one maglev system, but Congress still needs to appropriate most of 
that money. A U.S. maglev is not expected in full service for at 
least a decade, Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maglev operates on basic magnetic principles: When two magnets  
are put together, opposite poles attract, similar ones repel. 
Either magnetic attraction or repulsion can be used to lift or push 
the car above the guideway. In both cases, the train moves as the 
magnetic field travels along the guideway. 
</P>
<P>
	To qualify for construction funding, sponsors must be able to  
show that trains will reach speeds of at least 240 mph, about three 
times the top speeds on most Amtrak routes. Researchers believe the 
trains can hit 310 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	A Baltimore-to-Washington trip could take 16 minutes instead of  
the current 35. A Pittsburgh-to-Philadelphia trip could take two 
hours instead of the current six hours by car or eight hours by 
rail. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak is expected to reach about half of maglev's theoretical  
speed when the 150-mph Acela trains are introduced between 
Washington and Boston later this year. Trains already run at 125 
mph along the heavily traveled Northeast Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amtrak's approach is the incremental approach where we invest  
in existing rights of way,'' said Amtrak's Clifford Black. ``It 
remains to be seen whether (maglev) technology will justify its 
costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, he said Amtrak was open to embracing the  
technology later once it is proven. For now, the projects are being 
pushed by state, regional and business leaders, who would have to 
come up with one-third of any costs.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Take Small Steps to Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The turmoil has temporarily subsided for the  
Baltimore Orioles, who are convinced they still can make a run at 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore's 15-6 victory over the Texas Rangers Sunday night  
completed a 3-3 homestand that was considered wildly successful by 
Orioles standards, given that the 37-game stretch preceding it was 
disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Orioles must prove they can win someplace other than at  
Camden Yards. Baltimore, which starts a nine-game West Coast trip 
Tuesday night, is 12-12 at home but owns a major-league 4-15 record 
on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	First baseman Will Clark will be activated from the disabled  
list Tuesday after a five-week absence with a broken thumb and will 
accompany the team to Anaheim, Oakland and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played a lot better this homestand,'' Clark said. ``What we  
have to do now is continue to do that on the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to start from somewhere,'' catcher Charles Johnson  
said. ``I hope we can start from here. We're at the point now where 
we have to have a good roll. We keep playing like this, maybe we 
can put five or six wins together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles' last road trip included a six-game losing streak  
that fueled speculation that manager Ray Miller wouldn't be around 
for the duration of the homestand that followed. Miller seems to be 
more secure now, and a successful road trip would go a long way 
toward ending talk of his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles' mini-surge can be attributed to the revival of the  
starting rotation. Although Mike Mussina (7-1) and Sidney Ponson 
(4-3) are the only starters with more than one win, the unit has a 
3.78 ERA over the past seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore has scored more runs than both the Boston Red Sox and  
New York Yankees. But the Orioles have allowed five or more runs in 
30 of 43 games, which explains why Baltimore (16-27) has been in 
the cellar since April 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only people who have written us off are those who don't  
play the game,'' said left fielder B.J. Surhoff, who has a 14-game 
hitting streak and a .352 batting average. ``We feel if our 
pitching comes around and our bats stay hot, we can get right back 
in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surhoff, elevated to the No. 3 spot in the batting order after  
Clark went onto the disabled list, will stay there when Clark 
returns. Clark will bat fifth behind Albert Belle, who has done 
little at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle leads the AL with 43 walks, but is batting .262 and had  
only one RBI during the homestand, on a groundout in his final 
at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller expects Belle to see better pitches with Clark behind him  
in the lineup. Clark was hitting .370 with three doubles and three 
homers in only 12 games before the injury.

<HEADLINE> FCC Allowed To Regulate Nonprofits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission has the authority  
to regulate at least some nonprofit professional groups, such as 
dental associations, in an effort to protect competition, the 
Supreme Court said today. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the justices ordered lower courts to take a closer look  
to determine whether the FTC properly invalidated the California 
Dental Association's limits on dentist advertising. The FTC said 
the association's rules would bar even truthful ads. 
</P>
<P>
	All nine justices agreed that the FTC's authority to oversee  
for-profit corporations also extends to nonprofit professional 
groups that provide substantial economic benefits to their 
for-profit members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nonprofit entities organized on behalf of for-profit members  
have the same capacity ... to engage in unfair methods of 
competition or unfair and deceptive acts,'' Justice David H. Souter 
wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	But five justices decided that a lower court erred in upholding  
the FTC's decision that invalidated the California dental group's 
rules. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals should have used a 
less abbreviated review standard, the justices said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's ruling set aside a federal appeals court decision that  
said the FTC properly decided the California dental group's rules 
illegally harmed competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC regulates businesses to prevent unfair competition or  
deceptive practices. Federal law gives it authority over any 
company or association ``organized to carry on business for its own 
profit or that of its members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC said that includes the nonprofit dental association  
because its goal is to ensure that its members make money. 
</P>
<P>
	About three-fourths of California's dentists belong to the state  
dental association, which sets ethical rules including limits on 
what members' advertisements can say. Dentists who violate the 
rules can be censured or expelled from the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The association said its rules prohibited false or misleading  
advertising. But the FTC said in 1996 the dental group interpreted 
the rules broadly to bar even truthful advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said extensive disclosure requirements  
effectively banned dentists from advertising their fees as ``low, 
reasonable or affordable'' and from advertising discounts for 
senior citizens or new patients. Dentists also could not make 
claims about ``quality dentistry'' or say they used the ``latest 
techniques.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC said the restrictions harmed competition by keeping  
information from consumers and limiting dentists' ability to 
attract patients. The government ordered the association to narrow 
its rules to prohibit only false and misleading ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the order in 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	Other professional groups, including the American Medical  
Association and the National Society of Professional Engineers, 
supported the California group's appeal to the Supreme Court. They 
said there was no need for FTC regulation because professional 
associations already are subject to antitrust lawsuits filed by the 
Justice Department, state attorneys general and private parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-seven states backed the federal government, saying they  
needed the FTC's aid in enforcing antitrust and consumer protection 
laws in issues involving professional groups. 
</P>
<P>
	In ordering the lower court to take a new look at the California  
dental group's rules, Souter said, ``the plausibility of competing 
claims about the effects of the professional advertising 
restrictions rules out the indulgently abbreviated review'' used by 
the 9th Circuit court. 
</P>
<P>
	His opinion in that portion of the ruling was joined by Chief  
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, 
Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissenting from that section were Justices Stephen G. Breyer,  
John Paul Stevens, Anthony M. Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the four, Breyer said the lower used the proper  
review standard. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is California Dental Association vs. Federal Trade  
Commission, 97-1625.

                           *James Blades    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- James Blades, a symphonic percussionist whose most  
widely heard work was banging out ``V for victory'' for the BBC's 
wartime broadcasts, died May 19 at his home in Cheam. He was 97. 
</P>
<P>
	Blades also recorded the sound of the gong that was featured in  
the opening credits of films by the J. Arthur Rank studios. 
</P>
<P>
	His recording of the Morse code for ``V'' was played up to 150  
times a day at the start of British Broadcasting Corp. broadcasts 
to occupied Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Blades began drumming with a circus, then in cinemas. In 1982,  
he joined the London Film Society Orchestra. During the war he 
began playing with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and later 
with the English Opera Group, the Aldeburgh Festival and the 
English Chamber Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote ``Percussion Instruments and Their History,'' published  
in 1970, and two volumes of autobiography. 

</P>
<P>
                          *James Broughton    	
</P>
<P>
	PORT TOWNSEND, Wash. (AP) -- James Broughton, an avant-garde  
filmmaker and poet and a key figure in West Coast independent 
cinema, died May 17. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Broughton considered himself ``first and foremost a poet'' and  
was prominent in San Francisco's art community for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote more than 20 books of verse, including ``True and False  
Unicorn'' -- often considered his strongest and most important long 
poem. 
</P>
<P>
	But his avant garde films such as ``Dreamwood,'' ``The Pleasure  
Garden'' and ``The Golden Positions'' received more attention, 
earning him an American Film Institute lifetime achievement award 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	One, ``The Bed,'' focused on an ornate bed in a meadow where  
life's most significant moments -- birth, sex and death -- took 
place. Broughton played a role in the all-nude film. 
</P>
<P>
	Broughton began making films in the mid-1940s and also wrote  
plays for San Francisco's Playhouse Repertory Theater in the late 
1950s and 1960s. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Vanessa Brown    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vanessa Brown, who made her Broadway debut at  
13 and played ingenue roles in films of the 1940s and '50s before 
becoming a journalist, died of cancer Friday. She was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	She made her first movie at 16, 1944's ``Youth Runs Wild,'' and  
her other films of the 1940s and 1950s included ``Margie,'' ``The 
Ghost and Mrs. Muir'' and ``The Bad and the Beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born Smylla Brind in 1928 in Vienna, her family fled the Nazis  
when she was 9, moving first to France and then America. She heard 
that the producer of the play ``Watch on the Rhine'' was looking 
for a girl with a German accent. She went to the play's author, 
Lillian Hellman, got an understudy part and by the end of the 
Broadway run was a regular cast member. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, at 14, Ms. Brown joined ``The Quiz Kids'' radio  
show. The popular program had a panel of children answering 
listeners' questions. 
</P>
<P>
	She also did stage work, appearing on Broadway in 1952 in ``The  
Seven Year Itch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She left acting after marrying her second husband, director Mark  
Sandrich Jr., in 1959, but returned to the screen in the 1967 film 
``Rosie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1980s and 1990s she appeared on such television shows as  
``General Hospital,'' ``Murder, She Wrote'' and ``Homicide: Life on 
the Streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brown also was a playwright, novelist and a journalist,  
publishing in many newspapers and magazines and freelancing for the 
Voice of America.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Robert Carr Doyle, an Emmy-winning television  
producer who helped launch ``The Huntley-Brinkley Report'' and the 
National Geographic Society's TV nature specials, died Friday of 
pneumonia. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle won an Emmy Award for his work on the NBC-TV show that  
paired anchors David Brinkley in Washington and Chet Huntley and 
later worked for National Geographic from 1962 to 1972, producing 
28 nature documentary specials that won him other Emmy and Peabody 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked with such figures as Louis Leakey, Jane Goodall and  
Jacques Cousteau on the specials. 
</P>
<P>
	With NBC from 1946 to 1953, Doyle was involved with the first  
broadcasts of national political conventions and had coached four 
presidents, Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon Baines 
Johnson and Richard M. Nixon, on the use of television.

<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Owen Hart, the youngest member of a  
prominent Canadian wrestling family, died Sunday following a fall 
at an World Wrestling Federation event. He was 33. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart plunged 50 feet into the ring at a Kansas City arena as he  
was being lowered by cable before a match.. Hart, who wrestled 
under the nickname ``Blue Blazer'' for the federation, was 
pronounced dead at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5-foot-10 and 227 pounds, Hart entered the WWF in 1989, the  
last of Stu Harts' seven sons to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	During his 10-year career, he won several WWF titles, including  
four tag team champions, two intercontinental championships and a 
European championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart had recently told a magazine that he was planning to leave  
wrestling when his contract was up.

                        *Robert Rhodes James    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sir Robert Rhodes James, a prolific historian  
whose books included biographies of kings and prime ministers, died 
Thursday at his home in Great Gransden, Bedfordshire. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes James knew politics from the inside, serving as a clerk  
in the House of Commons for a decade and spending three years as a 
senior aide to U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim. He was elected 
to the House of Commons as a Conservative Party candidate in 1976, 
representing his Cambridge district until retiring in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes James published his first work in 1959, a biography of  
Lord Randolph Churchill, the father of Winston Churchill. He won 
acclaim with his next book, a life of Lord Rosebery, who became 
prime minister in 1894. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1965, Rhodes James published ``Gallipoli,'' becoming the  
first historian to use unpublished papers from the official inquiry 
into the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign in 1915. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970, Rhodes James published ``Churchill, a Study in Failure:  
1900-1939,'' examined the frustrations and failures of Winston 
Churchill before he became Britain's wartime prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	As a lawmaker, Rhodes James believed in ``one-nation''  
Conservatism, and was not always in sympathy with the more 
combative style of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

<HEADLINE> `Phantom' Can't Beat the Dinosaurs / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It's the kind of disappointment most studio  
executives would fall on their light sabers for: The ``Star Wars'' 
prequel failed to beat the opening-weekend record set by ``The Lost 
World: Jurassic Park,'' figures showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' amassed $64.8  
million Friday through Sunday, short of the $72.1 million for 
Steven Spielberg's dinosaurs over the Memorial Day weekend in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, ``Phantom'' was flying high. It set records with a  
five-day gross of $105.7 million and with a $28.5 million opening 
day. It also became the fastest movie to break the $100 million 
barrier, in just five days. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other big movie opening last weekend was ``The Love  
Letter,'' which had a disappointing $2.7 million for fifth place -- 
despite being billed as a romantic alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mummy,'' meanwhile, stayed strong enough to also break  
$100 million, collecting $13.8 million to finish second. 
``Entrapment'' was third with $6.3 million and ``The Matrix'' 
fourth with $2.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In art houses, ``Tea With Mussolini'' continued to do well,  
grossing $1.3 million. It dropped only 22 percent in the second 
week.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Take Break Before Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indiana Pacers low-keyed their second  
straight playoff sweep. No cheering. No hugging. Just a confident, 
ho-hum approach for a team picked to be right where it is, in the 
Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers got the day off Monday and learned later that their  
next opponent will be the New York Knicks, who completed a sweep of 
Atlanta with a 79-66 victory in Game 4 of their conference 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no big deal. It's just taking care of business, which is  
to win a championship,'' Mark Jackson said of the second-round 
victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand that we haven't done anything yet.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers are in the conference finals for the fourth time in  
six years, and for the first time they have homecourt advantage in 
the best-of-7 series. They lost Game 7 in each of their previous 
trips, including last season to Michael Jordan and the Chicago 
Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers will start the series on Sunday against New York, a  
team it is facing for the fifth time in the playoffs since 1993. 
The Pacers have won the last two series, including a 4-1 decision 
in last year's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	While coach Larry Bird said he didn't care which team Indiana  
faced, some of the Pacers were pulling for the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would certainly be fitting, because of all the history  
between the two teams,'' said Reggie Miller, whose last-second 
3-pointers and courtside antics with Spike Lee have helped make the 
Indiana-New York rivalry. ``Personally, it would be great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers are the only team that hasn't lost a game in the  
playoffs, putting together an 11-game winning streak that includes 
the final four games of the regular season. Milwaukee and 
Philadelphia had opportunities to snap the streak, but the Pacers 
always came up with the crucial score or stop when they needed it 
in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana was a preseason pick to reach the NBA Finals for the  
first time, but struggled in close games during the regular season. 
The Pacers finished 33-17, losing six of seven games in one-point 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	They look as if they've put those problems far behind them.  
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't care what people thought,'' Jackson said. ``We still  
don't care about it. I'm sure a lot of people will jump on the 
bandwagon now, but stay away. ... We're looking forward to winning 
this whole thing. Anything else, we're not going to be satisfied.''

<HEADLINE> Painless Pairing of Black Comedies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One-act plays rarely get major productions, even  
in the nonprofit theater, but the Drama Dept. has resurrected two 
of them off-Broadway with surprisingly good results. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprising, because one of them, ``Imagining Brad,'' didn't make  
much of an impression when it first was done by Circle Rep nearly 
10 years ago. Maybe the decade makes a difference. More likely, it 
is the fine performances of its two actresses, Polly Draper and Amy 
Ryan, that help take the black comedy by Peter Hedges beyond a 
sitcom jokiness that sank the earlier production. 
</P>
<P>
	Draper plays Dana Sue, a good ol' girl of the Nashville variety,  
who tries to welcome a mousy newcomer (Ryan) to church. Dana Sue 
and Brad's wife (she never is identified as anything else) chitchat 
over pink lemonade. The conversation gets around to husbands. At 
first, Dana Sue's helpmate sounds too good to true; Brad does not. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, poor Brad requires constant care. He is blind, has no  
arms or legs and resembles, says one character, a Christmas cookie. 
Yet Brad turns out to be the better husband, a fact that becomes 
apparent as Dana Sue shows up at church with more than just 
bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	Draper and Ryan play off each other perfectly. Draper's  
outrageous Southern-fried mannerisms -- think Minnie Pearl crossed 
with Scarlett O'Hara -- are balanced by Ryan's grave, almost sweet 
earnestness. The two of them help camouflage the obviousness of 
Hedges' plot, a morality tale whose lesson can be discerned without 
thinking too hard. 
</P>
<P>
	The evening opens with ``The Author's Voice,'' Richard  
Greenberg's effective if minor-league musings on the price of 
creativity. Or in other words, how to balance art and commerce and 
what happens when things take a tumble. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd is an up-and-coming author -- young, handsome and prized by  
his predatory female editor, Portia. Unfortunately, he can't write 
without Gene, his alter ego and inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene is an unhappy romantic; Todd is an opportunist. Together,  
they make for one bickering writer, a man can't quite get it all 
together. Gene desires Portia but wants Todd to woo her in the most 
ardent way possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd, dressed fashionable in basic black, while Gene, wearing a  
crumpled jogging outfit, can't even walk. He slithers across Todd's 
oddly surreal writer's garret as if he were a woolly serpent. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Seymour Hoffman overdoes Gene's neurotic ramblings, but  
Christopher Orr, as the hedonistic writer, and a buffed Paige 
Turco, as an editor who wears the season's shortest miniskirt, 
nicely capture the nastier side of New York's competitive cultural 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	Evan Yionoulis directs Greenberg's mortality tale with style. It  
goes down painlessly, maybe too painlessly for a work that seeks to 
teach a sharp lesson about suffering for art.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Down at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Tuesday morning on  
continued profit-taking. Tokyo stocks dropped on renewed concern 
about Japan's debt-ridden banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.99 yen at midday, down 1.05 yen from late  
Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 123.21 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 178.12 points,  
or 1.09 percent, to close the morning session at 16,212.37. On 
Monday, the average rose 97.51 points, or 0.60 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar remained under continued  
selling pressure from overseas players taking profits on recent 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. Investment banks still have interest to take profits  
following the recent sharp rise of the dollar,'' said a dealer at a 
European bank. ``The market is also undergoing a downward 
correction that will likely take a little while longer,'' he said, 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the dollar climbed to a seven-month high against the  
yen, rising above 124 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 130.45 yen, down  
from 131.22 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices started lower on concerns  
about the health of Japan's banking sector, a drop in U.S. stock 
prices and the rise of the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said investors are worried that Japanese banks may have  
another difficult fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide newspapers said Tuesday that 16 of Japan's largest  
banks held a total of $171.3 billion in bad loans as of March 31. 
It was the first time that banks have reported the loans under new 
standards which more accurately illustrate the true scale of the 
problem, according to the reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Also dampening sentiment was a decline on Wall Street, where the  
Dow Jones industrial average shed 174.61 points -- or 1.6 percent -- 
to 10,654.67 at Monday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is in a correction or adjustment period, but we  
don't expect any significant adjustment,'' said Yuichi Kohashi, 
chief strategist at Daiwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will take some time to regain momentum,'' he added.  
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was down 10.51 points, or 0.80 percent, to 
1,307.00. The TOPIX was up 7.84 points, or 0.60 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.3600 percent from Monday's finish of 1.3500 percent, driving 
its price down to 101.23 yen from 101.32 yen.

<HEADLINE> MedPartners To Sell Part of Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- MedPartners Inc. signed definitive agreements  
to sell five groups in its California physician management system, 
the first such deals in a plan to sell off its ailing subsidiary in 
the state, the company announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The five units represent about 13 percent of MedPartners  
Provider Network Inc., the subsidiary that manages business affairs 
for 117 clinics and more than 1,000 doctors in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The deals still must be approved by a bankruptcy court judge.  
The names of buyers and financial terms were withheld pending final 
approval of the sales, Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
	The units to be sold were identified as the Inland Empire Group,  
U.S. Family Care Medical, Cassidy Medical Group, Eaton Medical 
Group and High Desert Primary Care. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be no interruption of service for patients of doctors  
in those groups, Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
	MedPartners Inc. agreed to sell its California operations after  
the state seized MedPartners Provider Network and placed it under 
bankruptcy protection in March. 
</P>
<P>
	MedPartners Inc., squeezed by a falling share price and doctor  
discontent, said in November that it was quitting the physician 
management business. The company planned this year to sell or spin 
off 238 physician clinics and more than 13,000 affiliated doctors 
in 42 states.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Church Should Get Gov't Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Treading on traditional Republican territory,  
Vice President Al Gore said Monday that churches and other 
faith-based organizations -- where ``the client is not a number, but 
a child of God'' -- should receive government funds to help cure 
social ills. 
</P>
<P>
	His proposal for ``a new partnership'' between church and state,  
outlined in a presidential campaign speech at a downtown Salvation 
Army, centered around the notion that ``politics and morality are 
deeply interrelated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lest there be any doubt, the Democratic presidential candidate  
said three times that he believes in the separation of church and 
state. And his language suggested a skittishness at opening a war 
with civil libertarians. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as he said Americans must ``dare to embrace'' religious  
programs, he stipulated that closer church-state relations should 
be ``carefully tailored partnerships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a campaign swing here and in Orlando, Fla, Gore picked up  
$600,000 in donations. 
</P>
<P>
	He also met privately with five of the six students injured in  
last week's school shooting in Conyers, Ga., as well as family 
members of the shooting victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Places like The Salvation Army, Christ House, and Christian  
Women's Job Corps have some of the most effective programs dealing 
with addiction, mental illness and domestic violence, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the workers in these organizations, that client is not a  
number but a child of God,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should explore carefully tailored partnerships with our  
faith community, so we can use the approaches that are working 
best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His plan would essentially expand conservative Republican Sen.  
John Ashcroft's ``charitable choice'' provision of the 1996 welfare 
overhaul that allowed faith-based groups to operate welfare-to-work 
programs with government money. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was short on specifics -- communications director Laura  
Quinn called it a ``broad idea'' at this point -- but he insisted no 
government-funded program would ``promote a religious view or try 
to force anyone to receive religion'' and secular alternatives 
would be available. 
</P>
<P>
	But Terri Schroeder, a First Amendment legal analyst at The  
American Civil Liberties Union, said Gore's plan raised troubling 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can a religious institution counsel without proselytizing?  
How can you provide juvenile services without some level of 
coercion? How can we have any accountability for how our money is 
spent given the traditional separation of church and state,'' 
Schroeder asked. 
</P>
<P>
	For Gore, the political benefit of religious talk is twofold: It  
sneaks some ground out from under Republicans who have long 
dominated the morals debate; and, less overtly, may serve to 
disassociate him from President Clinton's personal scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's taken too long for candidate Gore to join Republicans in  
recognizing the rightful role of churches and religious 
organizations in solving society's most challenging and pressing 
problems,'' Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National 
Committee said. At the same time, he welcomed Gore's ``change of 
heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A senior policy adviser to Gore, Elaine Kamarck, told The Boston  
Globe over the weekend, ``The Democratic Party is going to take 
back God this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aboard Air Force Two on Monday, vice presidential spokesman  
Chris Lehane shook his head at Kamarck's candor. He refused to 
speak to the politics of Gore's new emphasis on spirituality and 
rejected the notion that Republicans have cornered the market on 
religious voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think God is partisan,'' Lehane said.  
</P>
<P>
	Beyond current-day political expedience, Gore can lay claim to a  
religious and spiritual grounding. As a young man returning from 
Vietnam, he studied at Vanderbilt's divinity school. And in his 
1991 book, ``Earth in the Balance,'' Gore wrote of his ``deeply 
personal'' relationship with Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, said Lehane, the vice president has never been someone to  
``wear God on his sleeve'' and doesn't plan to now that he's 
running for president. 
</P>
<P>
	On other questions of church and state, the vice president  
opposes organized prayer in public schools during the school day, 
and he opposes using public dollars to send children to parochial 
schools, Lehane said.

<HEADLINE> Hand-Held Computer Making Splash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- One month ago, Troy Henley, a technology  
manager at a Columbus, Ohio, law firm, came to work with a couple 
of hand-held Palm computers, hoping to convince the lawyers that 
the little gadgets could make them more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, just four weeks later, all nine attorneys in the personal  
injury practice have pitched their paper calendars and are showing 
up in court, on the golf course and at meetings with their 
computers in hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's funny. Once anybody saw it working they had to have  
one,'' said Henley. ``They don't do everything, but they do a 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, 3Com Corp. introduced its latest hand-held computer  
that does even more: The Palm VII allows users to go onto the 
Internet without being plugged into a wall. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the device is high and its services will initially  
be limited. Nonetheless, some analysts said the devices should be 
well received by consumers, who have already been embracing 
products like it that used to be just for techies. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1998, the hand-held computer market crossed the important  
billion-dollar sales threshold and is well on the way to reaching 
critical mass,'' said Scott Miller, principal analyst for the 
research firm Dataquest. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide sales of hand-held computers are expected to exceed  
5.7 million units in 1999, a 47 percent increase over 1998, 
according to Dataquest. The market is projected to grow more than 
30 percent through 2003, when sales are expected to reach 21 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	hand-held computers initially allowed users just to keep  
schedules and take notes. The small boxes could, in turn, be 
plugged into desktop computers to synchronize information. 
</P>
<P>
	The device has been improving during the past few years. While  
other attempts have been made to provide wireless Internet access, 
3Com's is notable because the Palm organizer is already highly 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Palm VII will cost $599, twice the price of the  
previous model. In addition, users must sign up for Palm's Internet 
service provider Palm.net, which will cost them at least $10 a 
month. Heavy users of the service will pay $100 a month or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially it will be available for sale only in the New York  
metropolitan area, but the company plans to offer it nationally 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Users will be able to send and receive e-mails, look up stock  
prices, sports scores or horoscopes, get news or driving directions 
-- among other services. 
</P>
<P>
	That sounds like a lot, but there are some drawbacks. The  
e-mails must be short and the e-mail address is different from the 
user's regular e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palm VII reformats Web pages to fit the smaller screen using  
a technology known as Web clipping that limits the content 
somewhat. Still, Web sites as diverse as ESPN.com, Moviefone.com, 
United Parcel Service and the online brokerage ETrade Group Inc. 
have signed on to provide content to the new Palm organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Kipper of Fountain Valley, Calif. uses a program that  
keeps track of golf scores and calculates bets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that carrying my Palm Pilot on the course would be a  
silly thing to do.'' But Kipper said he was pleasantly surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bookkeeping was always such a hassle, but not anymore,''  
he said. ``It is also a great way to check math.''

	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Craig Schmidt uses his hand-held Palm  
computer at work, at home, even on the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't sleep with my Palm Pilot and I usually don't do

<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- ``ER'' star Alex Kingston won't watch former  
husband Ralph Fiennes' movies because the experience would be ``too 
painful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fiennes left Ms. Kingston after 11 years, including two years of  
marriage, for actress Francesca Annis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got no idea what Ralph is up to,'' the British actress  
told Radio Times magazine. ``I won't see his work ever again. It 
would be too painful to watch 90 minutes of his face on screen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kingston, who remarried recently, said she wants to have  
children and is confident the writers of ``ER'' could cope with a 
pregnancy. She plays Dr. Elizabeth Corday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Either they'd write it in or I'll wear scrubs for nine months  
because they're so big they make you look pregnant,'' she said.

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A woman was arrested on suspicion of  
trying to sell her 8-year-old adopted Russian daughter for $4,000 
through an e-mail, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise K. Thomas was arrested Friday for investigation for  
criminal attempted trafficking in children and released, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What she was really trying to do was set up a private adoption  
to avoid the bureaucracy and regulations required around that 
issue. But yes, the bottom line was she was trying to sell the 
child,'' said Undersheriff Grayson Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl had not been abused, he said. She was placed in a  
foster home. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed sale was uncovered Friday when sheriff's deputies  
were contacted by a Texas couple who said they had received an 
e-mail from a woman offering to sell the girl in a ``private 
adoption.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Murphy: Vote Fraud Charge Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARMINGTON, Pa. (AP) -- A former congressman accused of voter  
fraud has denied the allegations and suggested his accusers were 
using the case for political gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Former U.S. Rep. Austin J. Murphy, 71, was arraigned Monday on  
charges of forgery, conspiracy, tampering with public records and 
falsifying public records. 
</P>
<P>
	The case centers on the Bouras Personal Care Home, a nursing  
home where 39 ballots from 1997 were found to be invalid because of 
forgeries. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy and two others were accused of writing in the name of  
Murphy's wife, Eileen, on the ballots of elderly people for a post 
on the Wharton Township election board. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy said he helped some nursing home residents complete  
paperwork for absentee ballots, but did nothing illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy claimed the case was the result of the political  
ambitions of the prosecutor, Fayette County District Attorney Peter 
Hook, who last week lost a bid for the Republican nomination to be 
a county commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	Hook did not return a telephone message left at his office.  
</P>
<P>
	Murphy retired from the Congress in 1994 after 18 years in  
office, where he was reprimanded for hiring a no-show staffer and 
permitting someone else to cast votes for him.

<HEADLINE> Report: Thefts Let China Build Nuke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China is able to build more advanced, mobile  
nuclear weapons ``on a par with our own'' as a result of two 
decades of stealing the most prized U.S. secrets, and it could 
begin testing one such weapon as early as this year, says a 
congressional report to be released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These thefts of nuclear secrets from our national weapons  
laboratories enabled (China) to design, develop and successfully 
test modern strategic weapons sooner than would otherwise have been 
possible,'' according to a copy of the report obtained by The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by a select House committee on Chinese espionage  
chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., said the People's 
Republic of China stole U.S. secrets about the seven major warheads 
in the current American nuclear arsenal as well as the neutron 
bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	``China has never stolen any other countries' secrets, including  
from the United States,'' said an official at Defense Ministry's 
office in Beijing that handles inquiries from foreign media. The 
official refused to give her name. 
</P>
<P>
	The thefts date to the late 1970s through the mid-1990s and  
``almost certainly continue to the present,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the stolen nuclear secrets, the PRC has leaped, in a  
handful of years, from 1950s-era strategic nuclear capabilities to 
the more modern nuclear designs,'' the report said. The new Chinese 
weapons are likely to be ``on a par with our own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the weapons China obtained significant information about  
is the miniaturized W-88 warhead, which is launched from 
submarines, and ``is the most sophisticated nuclear weapon the 
United States has ever built,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the select committee ``judges that the PRC will  
exploit elements of the stolen design information'' on its next 
generation of nuclear weapons, which will be moved from stationary 
silos to mobile locations. 
</P>
<P>
	It said China currently has two land-based and one  
submarine-based mobile nuclear weapon in development that ``will be 
able to strike the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The first of these new People's Liberation Army mobile ICBMs  
may be tested in 1999 and could be deployed as soon as 2002,'' the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has been taking steps since 1998 to counteract  
China's espionage and improve security at the nuclear weapons labs. 
The administration first learned of the extent of China's espionage 
in 1995 when the CIA obtained from a Chinese official a 1988-dated 
document that showed China had obtained sensitive information about 
several U.S. nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the  
security labs' shortcomings go back through both Republican and 
Democratic administrations, and he defended the administration's 
response to the security problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House ``has moved quickly to try to address it,'' he  
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan report, most of which was unclassified by  
agreement with the Clinton administration so it could be made 
public, details two decades of aggressive Chinese spying that began 
with the theft of neutron bomb secrets in the late 1970s and 
continued into the Clinton administration era. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last known example, the report states that ``in the late  
1990s, the PRC stole or illegally obtained U.S. developmental and 
research technology that, if taken to successful conclusion, could 
be used to attack U.S. satellites and submarines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``During the late 1990s, U.S. research and development work on  
electromagnetic weapons technology has been illegally obtained by 
the PRC as a result of successful espionage directed against the 
United States,'' the report adds.Such technology, once developed, 
can be used for space-based weapons to attack satellites and 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also says the Chinese have set up as many as 3,000  
front companies in the United States to assist its efforts and also 
gained valuable secrets about rocket components from two U.S. 
satellite manufacturers, Loral Corp. and Hughes Electronics, which 
remain under U.S. investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Loral and Hughes showed the PRC how to improve the design and  
reliability of the guidance system used in the PRC's newest Long 
March rocket,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report singled out Hughes for transfers of information in  
1993 and 1995 that the committee alleged might assist China's MIRV 
missile ``if the PRC decides to develop them'' and said the company 
acted without getting proper U.S. clearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hughes deliberately acted without seeking to obtain the  
legally required licenses,'' the report charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The 700-page report, about one-third of which remains  
classified, will characterize a voracious appetite by China for 
American know-how -- from nuclear secrets at U.S. weapons 
laboratories to satellite and computer technology it obtained 
through business and academic contacts. 
</P>
<P>
	The report describes a ``blurring of commerce and intelligence  
operations'' by China that poses an unprecedented challenge to U.S. 
efforts to keep China from getting America's military-related 
secrets, said congressional sources quoting from a portion of the 
document. 
</P>
<P>
	Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who appointed the Cox  
committee, said during a speech to a political fund-raising group 
Monday that the report shows ``the Chinese have made a very 
successful effort to gather up our secrets. It is possible ... that 
this is the largest breach of secrecy since the Soviet spy ring in 
the 1940s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report was approved unanimously by the committee in late  
December, but its release was delayed for months because of 
disagreements over how much of it should be kept classified. About 
70 percent of the original report is being made public, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also describes problems with lax security at the  
weapons labs and says that despite recent improvements, 
counterintelligence programs will not be what they should be until 
sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
	It contends that the espionage threat from China is much broader  
than the infiltration of the weapons labs, encompassing a broad 
array of technology-related businesses and academia. 
</P>
<P>
	There is evidence, the report concludes, that China has been  
using -- and continues to use -- an extensive network of both small 
and large businesses operated by Chinese nationals in the United 
States to penetrate civilian technology centers. 
</P>
<P>
	There may be more than 3,000 such American ``front companies'' --  
many concentrated in high-tech centers in California and New 
England -- with connections to the Chinese intelligence apparatus, 
the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the congressional panel concluded, China requires  
as a normal practice that many of the thousands of students, 
tourists and other Chinese visitors to the United States to seek 
out bits of information that might be used for military purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not providing specifics, Rep. Norman Dicks of Washington,  
the ranking Democrat on the committee, said it is clear that China 
uses an array of businesses and contacts at universities to gather 
technology information. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's touring groups or front companies or actual  
companies or scientific exchanges, they have a very diffuse system 
of collecting intelligence,'' Dicks said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, Cox, the committee's chairman, said Chinese  
espionage ``has been occurring for some decades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``More importantly,'' he continued, his committee's findings  
will say that ``it continues ... to this very day.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Thefts Let China Build Nuke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China is able to build more advanced, mobile  
nuclear weapons ``on a par with our own'' as a result of two 
decades of stealing the most prized U.S. secrets, and it could 
begin testing one such weapon as early as this year, says a 
congressional report to be released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These thefts of nuclear secrets from our national weapons  
laboratories enabled (China) to design, develop and successfully 
test modern strategic weapons sooner than would otherwise have been 
possible,'' according to a copy of the report obtained By The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by a select House committee on Chinese espionage  
chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., said the People's 
Republic of China stole U.S. secrets about the seven major warheads 
in the current American nuclear arsenal as well as the neutron 
bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	The thefts date to the late 1970s through the mid-1990s and  
``almost certainly continue to the present,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the stolen nuclear secrets, the PRC (People's Republic of  
China) has leaped, in a handful of years, from 1950s-era strategic 
nuclear capabilities to the more modern nuclear designs,'' the 
report said. The new Chinese weapons are likely to be ``on a par 
with our own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the weapons China obtained significant information about  
is the miniaturized W-88 warhead, which is launched from 
submarines, and ``is the most sophisticated nuclear weapon the 
United States has ever built,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the select committee ``judges that the PRC will  
exploit elements of the stolen design information'' on its next 
generation of nuclear weapons, which will be moved from stationary 
silos to mobile locations. 
</P>
<P>
	It said China currently has two land-based and one  
submarine-based mobile nuclear weapon in development that ``will be 
able to strike the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The first of these new People's Liberation Army mobile ICBMs  
may be tested in 1999 and could be deployed as soon as 2002,'' the 
report said.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Harassment Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from the Supreme Court's harassment decision:  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's majority opinion:  
</P>
<P>
	We consider here whether a private damages action may lie  
against the school board in cases of student-on-student harassment. 
We conclude that it may, but only where the funding recipient acts 
with deliberate indifference to known acts of harassment in its 
programs or activities. Moreover, we conclude that such an action 
will lie only for harassment that is so severe, pervasive and 
objectively offensive that it effectively bars the victim's access 
to an educational opportunity or benefit. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Title IX provides, with certain exceptions not at issue here,  
that ``no person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, 
be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be 
subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity 
receiving federal financial assistance.'' ... 
</P>
<P>
	In (a 1998 ruling) we concluded that a recipient of federal  
education funds may be liable in damages under Title IX where it is 
deliberately indifferent to known acts of sexual harassment by a 
teacher. ... We consider here whether the misconduct identified in 
(that case) -- deliberate indifference of known acts of harassment -- 
amounts to an intentional violation of Title IX, capable of 
supporting a private damages action when the harasser is a student 
rather than a teacher. We conclude that, in certain limited 
circumstances, it does. ... 
</P>
<P>
	We stress that our conclusion here ... does not mean that  
recipients can avoid liability only by purging their schools of 
actionable peer harassment or that administrators must engage in 
particular disciplinary action. ... School administrators will 
continue to enjoy the flexibility they require. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Courts ... must bear in mind that schools are unlike the adult  
workplace and that children may regularly interact in a manner that 
would be unacceptable among adults. ... Indeed, at least early on, 
students are still learning how to interact appropriately with 
their peers. It is thus understandable that, in the school setting, 
students often engage in insults, banter, teasing, shoving, pushing 
and gender-specific conduct that is upsetting to the students 
subjected to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Damages are not available for simple acts of teasing and  
name-calling among schoolchildren, however, even where these 
comments target differences in gender. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's dissent:  
</P>
<P>
	The only certainty flowing to the majority's decision is that  
scarce resources will be diverted from educating our children and 
that many school districts, desperate to avoid Title IX peer 
harassment suits, will adopt whatever federal code of student 
conduct and discipline the Department of Education sees fit to 
impose upon them. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's schoolchildren will learn their first lessons about  
federalism in classrooms where the federal government is the 
ever-present regulator. The federal government will have insinuated 
itself not only into one of the most traditional areas of state 
concern but also into one of the most sensitive areas of human 
affairs. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps even more startling than its broad assumptions about  
school control over primary and secondary school students is the 
majority's failure to grapple in any meaningful way with the 
distinction between elementary and secondary schools, on the one 
hand, and universities on the other. ... 
</P>
<P>
	After today, Johnny will find that the routine problems of  
adolescence are to be resolved by invoking a federal right to 
demand assignment to a desk two rows away. ... The complaint of 
this fifth-grader survives and the school will be compelled to 
answer in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	We can be assured that like suits will follow -- suits, which in  
cost and number, will impose serious financial burdens on local 
school districts, the taxpayers who support them and the children 
they serve. Federalism and our struggling school systems deserve 
better from this court.

<HEADLINE> Finalists Picked for 'Maglev' Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Projects in seven states are in the running to  
build the nation's first magnetic levitation train, a high-speed 
rail system that promises to relieve congested highways and 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven ``maglev'' finalists in California, Florida, Georgia,  
Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada and Pennsylvania were announced Monday. 
Four others -- one each in Colorado and Virginia and two in Alabama 
-- were rejected for unspecified reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven selected projects will get $12 million combined in  
grants for further studies on their feasibility, and one will be 
chosen next year for development and construction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must get people out of the autos, off the highways,'' said  
Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening. ``The only way we can do that is 
to have an acceptable alternative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His state was designated a finalist for a Baltimore-Washington  
route expected to take 16 minutes, down from the current 35 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Cioletti, manager of systems engineering with Maglev Inc.,  
which is proposing a Pittsburgh-to-Philadelphia route, said maglev 
would offer advantages over airports by directly serving the city's 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	The trains, using electromagnetic forces to lift the train above  
ground and free it of speed-reducing friction, could run about 
three times the speed of conventional trains. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every great accomplishment was first and for a period of time  
a dream,'' Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said at the B &AMP; O 
Railroad Museum, with vintage locomotives and boxcars serving as a 
backdrop. ``I'm delighted to give fire to this dream, this 
thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maglev systems are already being tested in Germany and Japan,  
but no such system is in commercial service anywhere in the world. 
Critics say that while the technology works in test settings, many 
questions remain over full-scale operations and costs. 
</P>
<P>
	A transportation law last year authorized $1 billion to build  
one maglev system, but Congress still needs to appropriate most of 
that money. A U.S. maglev is not expected in full service for at 
least a decade, Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maglev operates on basic magnetic principles: When two magnets  
are put together, opposite poles attract, similar ones repel. 
Either magnetic attraction or repulsion can be used to lift or push 
the car above the guideway. In both cases, the train moves as the 
magnetic field travels along the guideway. 
</P>
<P>
	To qualify for construction funding, sponsors must be able to  
show that trains will reach speeds of at least 240 mph, about three 
times the top speeds on most Amtrak routes. Researchers believe the 
trains can hit 310 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak is expected to reach about half of maglev's theoretical  
speed when the 150-mph Acela trains are introduced between 
Washington and Boston later this year. Trains already run at 125 
mph along the heavily traveled Northeast Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amtrak's approach is the incremental approach where we invest  
in existing rights of way,'' said Amtrak's Clifford Black. ``It 
remains to be seen whether (maglev) technology will justify its 
costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, he said Amtrak was open to embracing the  
technology later once it is proven. For now, the projects are being 
pushed by state, regional and business leaders, who would have to 
come up with one-third of any costs.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Mom Tried Selling Child on Net </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A woman was arrested on suspicion of  
trying to sell her 8-year-old adopted Russian daughter for $4,000 
through an e-mail, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise K. Thomas was arrested Friday for investigation for  
criminal attempted trafficking in children and released, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What she was really trying to do was set up a private adoption  
to avoid the bureaucracy and regulations required around that 
issue. But yes, the bottom line was she was trying to sell the 
child,'' said Undersheriff Grayson Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Thomas, 42, who is married and lives with her husband and  
biological 14-year-old son, denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no intention of selling a child or anything like that,''  
Mrs. Thomas said in an interview with KWGN-TV on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``For whatever reason they've blown this thing way out of  
proportion, not even bothered to interview us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The girl had not been abused, Robinson said. She was placed in a  
foster home. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed sale was uncovered Friday when sheriff's deputies  
were contacted by a Texas couple who said they had received an 
e-mail from a woman offering to sell the girl in a ``private 
adoption.''

<HEADLINE> Survey: Job Market Remains Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The job market should remain strong through the  
summer, with the highest demand for workers expected in Western 
states, according to a survey being released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A quarterly survey of more than 15,000 companies by Manpower  
Inc. reported that 32 percent planned to increase hiring in the 
third quarter. Just 6 percent anticipated cutbacks, while 58 
percent foresaw no change. The remaining 4 percent were unsure, the 
survey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures were almost identical to the year-earlier tallies  
and up slightly from the April-June period, when 29 percent of the 
companies surveyed said they planned to increase their staffs. In 
that survey, 6 percent planned reductions, 61 percent said hiring 
needs were unchanged and 4 percent said they were unsure. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings by Manpower suggest that strong job creation should  
continue to hold U.S. unemployment in check. The nation's 
unemployment rate has been at or below 4.5 percent for the past 12 
months, the best showing in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Joerres, president and chief executive officer of  
Manpower, based in Milwaukee, said the totals reflected ``a steady 
demand for new employees that has persisted over the past nine 
quarters'' in American's longest peacetime economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	He described it as ``a protracted period of opportunity for  
workers of nearly all types.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manpower, the nation's largest temporary staffing business, said  
the strongest market for workers would be in Western states, where 
some 35 percent of survey respondents said they planned additional 
hiring in the July-September quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that hiring projections this year by both  
service firms and public administration in the Western region 
represents ``a level of activity not seen ... in two decades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Midwest region, generally the third-quarter employment  
leader, had its traditional strong demand for summertime 
construction workers but a soft market for workers in durable goods 
manufacturing, Manpower said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, the outlook among durable goods manufacturers -- the  
makers of products such as computers, appliances and autos -- in the 
July-September quarter ``is slightly below that of the 
corresponding period last year for the fifth consecutive quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manpower's survey was based on telephone interviews with more  
than 15,000 employers in 484 U.S. cities. The company said its 
figures have a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage 
points.

<HEADLINE> Disabled Workers' Suits Made Easier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court made it easier today for  
disabled workers to sue their employers over alleged discrimination 
after they apply for or receive Social Security disability 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, voting unanimously in a Texas case, said courts  
cannot presume that people who apply for such benefits are, in 
essence, admitting to be unqualified to hold a job and therefore 
cannot invoke the protection of a key anti-bias law, the Americans 
with Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling is a victory for Carolyn Cleveland, a stroke victim  
who was fired after attempting to return to work. Today's decision 
reinstates her lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the court, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said a lower  
court that threw out Cleveland's lawsuit ``thought, in essence, 
that claims under both acts would incorporate two directly 
conflicting propositions, namely `I am too disabled to work' and `I 
am not too disabled to work.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Breyer said claims filed under both laws do not necessarily  
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are too many situations in which ... (a Social Security  
disability) claim and an ADA claim can comfortably exist side by 
side,'' he said. Some people who sue under the ADA contend they 
could work if provided reasonable accommodations, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Breyer said people who sue under the ADA after seeking  
Social Security disability benefits must provide a ``sufficient 
explanation'' why the two do not conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland had worked for Policy Management Systems Corp. in  
Dallas for six months, conducting telephone background checks of 
prospective employees, when in January of 1994 she suffered a 
stroke. She took a leave of absence and applied for Social Security 
disability benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	On her application, she stated that she was unable to work. In  
April of that year, Cleveland's doctor cleared her to return to 
work. She resumed her job with Policy Management Systems and 
notified Social Security officials about her improved health. 
</P>
<P>
	She and her former employer disagree over whether Cleveland told  
Social Security officials that she no longer needed benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland had trouble performing her job and asked for several  
accommodations to help her. He employer turned down each request 
and fired her in July of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	She subsequently renewed her application for disability benefits  
and, after receiving them, sued Policy Management Systems. She 
alleged that her firing amounted to illegal discrimination based on 
her disability. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans with Disabilities Act bans employers from  
discriminating against ``a qualified individual with a disability'' 
because of that disability. The 1990 law defines a qualified 
individual as one who can perform the essential functions of his or 
her job when given reasonable accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal trial judge threw out Cleveland's lawsuit, and the 5th  
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	Disagreeing with most other federal appeals courts, the New  
Orleans-based 5th Circuit court ruled that people who apply for or 
receive Social Security disability benefits have to overcome a 
``rebuttable presumption'' that they are not a qualified individual 
as defined by the anti-bias law. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's ensuing appeal to the nation's highest court was  
supported by the Clinton administration and the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission, whose lawyers voiced concern for those 
workers who confront discrimination when seeking to return to their 
jobs after temporary disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the court today, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said the  
5th Circuit court was wrong in presuming Cleveland was not 
qualified under the ADA. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, he said, in such cases ``the court should require  
an explanation of any apparent inconsistency with the necessary 
elements of an ADA claim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Cleveland vs. Policy Management Systems Corp.,  
97-1008.

<HEADLINE> Mfume Won't Run for Baltimore Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- NAACP president Kweisi Mfume said Monday he  
won't run for mayor of Baltimore, ending months of speculation and 
cajoling by politicians, business leaders and activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Mfume said he left Congress to pursue the fight for civil rights  
and isn't ready to give up the cause. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that my job is to finish the work that I have begun, to  
create a more just and humane society for all people, regardless of 
race, religion, ethnicity or background,'' he said. ``I cannot walk 
away from that fight at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 250 politicians, business leaders and activists signed  
full-page ads urging Mfume to run for the office held by three-term 
Mayor Kurt Schmoke, who is not seeking re-election after 12 years 
of struggling to reverse the city's declining health and safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Mfume, a 50-year-old Baltimore native and former city  
councilman, had been running out of time to decide. The deadline is 
July 6 to file for the September primary -- the real race to win in 
this predominantly Democratic city. 
</P>
<P>
	Former City Councilman Carl Stokes has already entered the race.  
And City Council President Lawrence Bell, who is Mfume's cousin, is 
expected to announce on Tuesday that he is running. Former Gov. 
William Donald Schaefer, who was mayor of Baltimore for nearly 16 
years, had endorsed Mfume but political observers said he may run 
himself now. 
</P>
<P>
	Mfume said he will not endorse any candidate until the filing  
deadline has passed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mfume said his decision was based on where he could do the  
greatest good for the greatest number of people. He made the 
announcement at NAACP headquarters, leading to speculation that he 
would remain with the nation's oldest civil rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
	As a nine-year member of the House, Mfume became head of the  
Congressional Black Caucus and gained a reputation as an eloquent 
and charismatic figure. He quit Congress in 1996 to take over the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

	Report: Thefts Let China Build Nuke  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China can build more advanced, mobile nuclear  
weapons ``on a par with our own'' as a result of two decades of 
stealing U.S. secrets, and it could begin testing one such weapon 
as early as this year, says a congressional report to be released 
tomorrow. ``These thefts of nuclear secrets from our national 
weapons laboratories enabled (China) to design, develop and 
successfully test modern strategic weapons sooner than would 
otherwise have been possible,'' according to a copy of the report 
obtained by The Associated Press. The report is by a select House 
committee on Chinese espionage. It reported China stole U.S. 
secrets about the seven major warheads in the current American 
nculear arsenal as well as the neutron bomb. The thefts from the 
late 1970s through the mid-1990s ``almost certainly continue to the 
present,'' the report said.

	NATO Hits Yugoslavia Again  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO warplanes roared over Kosovo,  
Belgrade and elsewhere in Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia, 
as allied attacks entered their third month. Air raid sirens 
sounded after sundown in Yugoslavia's three largest cities -- 
Belgrade, Novi Sad and Nis -- and elsewhere. Ten strong explosions 
rocked Novi Sad near a refinery and power station and four missiles 
fired by NATO jets struck civilian targets around Glogovac, 15 
miles southwest of Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina, the 
state-run Tanjug news agency reported.

	Mrs. Clinton Plans To Live in N.Y.  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton says she will  
definitely make her home in New York after leaving the White House, 
whether or not she runs for the Senate. She made the commitment 
during a CBS-TV ``60 Minutes II'' interview when asked which New 
York baseball team she would root for. ``The politic answer, since 
I do plan to live in New York no matter what I end up doing, is 
I'll root for both,'' Mrs. Clinton said. The interview, taped May 
20, will air Wednesday night.

	Clinton Urges Young Volunteers  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saluting theirs as ``a better way to live,''  
President Clinton urged young volunteers today to preach their 
message of teamwork and service to youths who feel alienated from 
society. Clinton addressed the 10th anniversary celebration of the 
City Year service organization. He asked the 1,000 attendees to set 
examples for other young adults.

	Schools May Be Liable in Harassment  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 today that schools  
can be sued if officials fail to stop students from sexually 
harassing each other. It found that schools that accept federal 
money can be forced to pay victims of such harassment. The court 
also decided that police who let the news media accompany them into 
people's homes can be sued for violating the Constitution's 
protection against unreasonable searches. It also turned down an 
appeal by a Maine dentist who was sued for refusing to treat a 
woman because she has the virus that causes AIDS.

	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The mother of the teen accused of shooting  
six fellow students at his high school apologized to the victims 
and thanked the assistant principal who stopped her son from 
committing suicide. Mae Dean Daniele spoke in a tearful interview 
on CNN. Heritage High School students returned to class today for 
the first time since last week's shooting in suburban Atlanta.

	Attorney: NYC Cop To Plead Guilty  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A police officer accused of torturing a prisoner  
inside a Brooklyn stationhouse will change his plea to guilty, his 
lawyer told a federal judge. ``We would like to enter a plea,'' 
attorney Marvyn Kornberg, lawyer for Officer Justin Volpe, said 
today according to a transcript. The case against the four 
remaining officers was expected to proceed. A source connected with 
the prosecution who requested anonymity said there was no agreement 
with Volpe on a recommended sentence. The five officers were 
accused of mistreating a black Haitian immigrant.

	Mike Tyson Leaves Jail  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mike Tyson walked out of a suburban Maryland  
jail today after serving less than a quarter of his one-year 
sentence for assaulting two motorists after a fender-bender. The 
smiling ex-heavyweight champ left the Rockville, Md., jail where he 
spent the past 3 1/2 months. Tyson's release came hours after an 
Indiana judge announced her decision to end his probation for a 
1992 rape conviction.

<HEADLINE> New Site for Shockwave Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Software maker Macromedia Inc. has formed a  
new unit to promote its Shockwave technology on a Web site it hopes 
will become an entertainment hub on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The unit, called shockwave.com, will operate a Web site by the  
same name. The site will guide users to games, puzzles and 
animation created by Macromedia's Shockwave and Flash technology, 
the company said today in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Web site, users will be able to download two pieces of  
software that play Shockwave files. The free Shockwave Remote 
allows Internet users to search out and play back music, comics and 
games, and then save up to five pieces of content for use at 
anytime -- even when their computers are not connected to the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who want to save more than five titles can upgrade to  
Shockmachine, which will be sold for $19.95 and offer unlimited 
save capacity and exclusive content. The software also organizes 
stored titles in customized categories. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco-based Macromedia has lined up several partners  
for shockwave.com, including Comedy Central, Hasbro Inc. 
Interactive, Marvel Enterprises Inc., News Corp.'s Fox Interactive 
and Sega of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The company says the new Web site and the two Shockwave players  
will launch early this summer.

<HEADLINE> Bradley To Offer Gun Control Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Sen. Bill Bradley, Al Gore's sole rival  
for the Democratic presidential nomination, is considering 
including a ban on the sale of handguns in an aggressive gun 
control plan that he will unveil later in his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm considering all the alternatives,'' the former New Jersey  
lawmaker said Monday in an interview with The Associated Press. He 
already has endorsed a ``handgun card'' -- a photo identity card 
required of anybody carrying a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	Propelled by school shootings in Colorado and Georgia this  
spring, the Senate passed measures last week to require background 
checks at gun shows and gun safety locks. Gore cast the 
tie-breaking vote for one of the measures, a moment of drama aides 
hope will give his campaign some badly needed momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said the action was not enough. He supports limiting  
handgun purchases to one per month and making it a felony to sell 
handguns to children under 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he also would seek to ban the possession of  
handguns by minors. 
</P>
<P>
	``These events have come at regular intervals now and they have  
a shocking effect on people,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the political influence of the National Rifle  
Association is on the ebb. ``My sense is that the NRA or the gun 
lobby ... is where the tobacco lobby was eight or nine years ago. 
People are beginning to wake up (to see) there is a better way to 
do this and this is a really threat to our culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Bradley supported a 30 percent federal tax on  
handguns, assault weapons and ammunition. He could not recall that 
position Monday, but voiced no reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he would go beyond incremental measures and seek a  
ban of handguns, Bradley said: ``I don't have any comment on that 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Do you support banning handguns?  
</P>
<P>
	``I have not supported it up to this point,'' he replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Is that something you hope to do?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm considering all alternatives.''  
</P>
<P>
	Including banning handguns?  
</P>
<P>
	``Until I decide, I haven't decided.''  
</P>
<P>
	Asked again, he smiled and said, ``If I was going to do it, why  
would I want to step on my own story now?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Bradley adviser confirmed that he is considering calling for a  
ban on the sale -- not possession -- of handguns as part of a broad 
plan to reduce the number of weapons on the streets. There also are 
ways to do that short of banning sales of guns, the official said, 
such as targeting manufacturers with a heavy tax. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Bradley was asked why he proposed taxes on guns and not  
a ban. ``I would be glad to have no guns to tax, but having fought 
the NRA before, I am realistic,'' Bradley answered. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Bradley was asked the same question; this time, he  
didn't say it was unrealistic. ``I think things have changed -- the 
(political) climate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Gore pushing restrictions on guns, Bradley did not argue  
that this was an issue that distinguishes him from the vice 
president. But he repeatedly mentioned a 1994 Senate speech in 
which he laid out his solutions to the problems of violence in 
society. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point here in terms of violence and guns violence is this  
is not something that I've come to in the last two weeks,'' Bradley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said the vice president has been  
taking action to curb gun violence while Republicans ``and others 
seem to still be thinking through what is needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the prospect of a handgun ban, Lehane said, ``Sweeping  
simplistic approaches are not what is needed. The vice president is 
talking about specific steps to limit the availability of guns 
getting into the hands of children. Moreover and beyond that, he 
believes that guns is only one part of the solution. He also 
believes that parents, teachers and the entertainment industry all 
have a responsibility and a role to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the AP interview, Bradley reaffirmed his support of gun  
control initiatives dating to his Senate days, including: 
</P>
<P>
	--Requiring the registration of handguns as they transfer from  
one owner to the next, much like the title to a car. 
</P>
<P>
	--A uniform gun license and photo identification, obtained after  
a handgun owner passes a background check to make sure he or she is 
not a felon. The owner would carry the ``handgun card'' when 
carrying the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	--Raising license fees on gun dealers, in part so there would be  
fewer of them.

<HEADLINE> Wash., Mass. Get Tobacco Deal Bonus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- Washington state will receive a $100  
million bonus from the nationwide tobacco settlement because 
Attorney General Christine Gregoire was the states' lead 
negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
	The $206 billion settlement, reached last fall, included an $8.6  
billion ``strategic contribution fund'' to reward states that 
played leadership roles in suing the industry or participating in 
the settlement talks. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, a three-member panel of former attorneys general  
allocated $394.9 million from the fund to Washington state. Only 
New York and California were granted more money, because of their 
larger populations. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gregoire announced Monday that in a second round of  
allocations, the panel took into account her role as lead 
negotiator in the settlement. Her lawsuit, which was being tried 
when the settlement was reached, was the ninth filed by a state 
against the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the panel boosted Washington's share to $494.9  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	That money comes on top of the $4 billion Washington is slated  
to receive over 25 years as part of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states that played leading roles in the settlement were  
scheduled to receive bonuses too. Massachusetts announced it will 
receive $55.6 million on top of $358.6 million awarded to the 
state.

<HEADLINE> This Software Listens to You </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Never mind all that stuff going on in movie theaters. In word  
processing the evil Empire is Microsoft Word, and the Rebel 
Alliance is WordPerfect by Corel. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, WordPerfect has released Office 2000, the latest round in a  
never-ending contest for desktops. And the gimmick here is voice 
recognition, now part of WordPerfect 9.0 and provided by Dragon 
Naturally Speaking. Which, for the time being, puts WordPerfect 
Office 2000 one up. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Office Professional isn't shipping until June 10,  
although CompUSA is accepting online pre-orders for $549.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Over at online merchant Buysoft, the WordPerfect suite is  
available for order at $314.95. 
</P>
<P>
	This column is being written mostly by speaking into a  
microphone. Editing it is being done by keyboard mostly because I'm 
too lazy to learn two pages of Voice Commands. Besides, I've been a 
WordPerfect fan for years, and the keyboard commands are second 
nature to me. 
</P>
<P>
	How well does voice recognition work? So-so. In the first  
sentence of this article, the computer thought the words ``Rebel 
Alliance'' were ``rubble lines.'' And it thought the manufacturer 
of the software was ``Cornell'' not Corel. 
</P>
<P>
	But for a $315 package that includes the voice recognition, plus  
presentation, spreadsheets, database and Web publishing software, 
and thousands of clip art images and fonts, those glitches can be 
overlooked. And if, because of physical impairment, you have been 
unable to type, the voice recognition could be a godsend. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Dragon Naturally Speaking software does learn  
automatically and over time, so I expect recognition to become 
steadily better. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking of time, budget at least 30 minutes of your  
installation time just to train the voice recognition. You do that 
by leading from a prepared text that the software already knows, 
until it has learned to associate your particular command station 
correctly. 
</P>
<P>
	The talk-to-type feature aside, WordPerfect 9.0 includes the  
ability to preview formatting changes before they are made. Seeing 
stylistic disaster before it happens is lots easier than undoing it 
after it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
	And it allows you to publish a document as an Adobe Acrobat PDF  
file, the de facto standard for gross-platform document sharing. 
The software has improved document-reading and browsing control as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	The other software components of the package have also been  
improved. Quattro Pro, for example, can now handle a worksheet of a 
million rowns and 18,000 columns, not that any human being would 
need such a thing. 
</P>
<P>
	With the voice-recognition software installed, system  
requirements are stiff: WordPerfect Office 2000 wants to see at 
least a 133-megahertz Pentium processor, 48 megabytes of RAM for 
Windows 95 and 64 megabytes of RAM for Windows 98 and Windows NT 
4.0, and, of course, a 16-bit sound card. A headset microphone is 
included. Installation takes a minimum of 220 megabytes and a 
typical installation is 330 megabytes. 
</P>
<P>
	Corel Products are widely available at retail and online.

<HEADLINE> Two Climbers Die in Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Warm weather may have contributed to the  
deaths of a couple who fell more than 1,000 feet when mushy snow 
apparently gave way on their descent down Mount Hood. 
</P>
<P>
	The climbers, a husband and wife in their 20s whose names were  
not released, were roped together. One slipped and pulled the other 
down about 9 a.m. Sunday as they were coming off the 11,245-foot 
mountain 60 miles east of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were roped in and had all the right equipment,'' said  
Steve Fuhr, one of dozens of other climbers near the summit. ``They 
just took a bad fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The snow was soft on the mountain as temperatures jumped into  
the low 90s for the first time this year across much of the state, 
said Craig McCurdy of the Hood River Crag Rats rescue team. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple had climbed the Cooper Spur route Saturday night and  
pitched a tent. They reached the summit about 8 a.m., stayed for 
about five minutes and then began their descent. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews were expected to remove the bodies today.  
</P>
<P>
	The last fatal accident on the peak was in May 1998, when a  
University of Portland physics professor was killed in an avalanche 
near the summit. About 10,000 people climb the mountain every year.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Down on Weather News / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures fell sharply Monday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade amid expectations dry weather later this 
week will speed Midwest plantings and boost chances for another 
year of bumper crops. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department was expected to report that  
farmers in the past week are close to completion of corn plantings 
and are about half-done planting soybeans. Midwest farmers have 
managed to meet or exceed the five-year average for planting this 
spring despite sometimes heavy rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
	With the National Weather Service and several private  
forecasters predicting dry, warm weather in major growing areas 
beginning about midweek and lasting through the weekend, analysts 
expect farmers will speed their pace of planting even further. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are worried about bumper crops adding to already ample  
inventories, despite a somewhat brighter in the export picture. 
Corn shipments, for instance, have beat market expectations for 
several weeks, but market participants continue to fret about 
new-crop supplies that will compete for business with other 
countries that have recently harvested bumper production. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures also were pressured by expectations for solid  
spring wheat plantings and amid early harvesting of the winter 
wheat crop, which accounts for much of the nation's total. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 5 cents to $2.47 1/4 a bushel; July  
corn fell 6 3/4 cents to $2.11 3/4 a bushel; July oats fell 2 1/2 cents to 
$1.17 3/4 a bushel; July soybeans fell 6 3/4 cents to $4.55 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  
after the government reported frozen pork inventories jumped to 
record levels last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA's monthly cold storage report indicated the meatpackers  
have ample supplies of ham and pork bellies, used for making bacon, 
and will need to slaughter fewer hogs during the peak summer demand 
period. Frozen pork inventories have jumped to 593.510 million 
pounds, surpassing the previous record of 583 million pounds set in 
April 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	June lean hogs fell 2 cents to 54.90 cents a pound; July pork  
bellies fell 1.4 cents to 52.20 cents a pound; June live cattle 
fell .17 cent to 63.35 cents a pound; August feeder cattle rose .30 
cent to 75.32 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Rent Control Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today rejected a challenge  
to California cities' power to limit rents without having to prove 
at trial that the controls are achieving their goals. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, let stand a California Supreme  
Court ruling that leaves it to the state Legislature to decide 
whether rent control laws need to be changed or repealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The state court ruling, reached by a 4-3 vote last January,  
upheld a voter-approved 1979 rent control ordinance in Santa 
Monica, one of the state's toughest. 
</P>
<P>
	``With rent control, as with most other such social and economic  
legislation, we leave to legislative bodies rather than the courts 
to evaluate whether the legislation has fallen so far short of its 
goals as to warrant repeal or amendment,'' the state court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of a 12-unit apartment building in Santa Monica had  
challenged the city's rent controls ordinance as it applied to its 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	The landlord, Santa Monica Beach Ltd., sued in 1994 after  
requested rent hikes were denied in 1992 and 1993. A $3-per-month 
increase was allowed for each unit in 1993. The lawsuit contended 
that rather than helping, rent controls actually were hurting 
low-income residents by reducing the city's supply of affordable 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
	The city had adopted the rent controls to ensure a supply of  
affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not considering the question whether rent control is  
good policy but rather affirming the constitutional propriety of 
having the political process, through state and local legislative 
bodies, determine that policy,'' California's highest court ruled 
without reaching the merits of the landlord's argument. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower state courts had required a trial on the allegations made  
by Santa Monica Beach Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the landlord argued  
that the rent controls amounted to an unlawful ``regulatory 
taking'' because it hampered an owner's use of property without 
paying the ``just compensation'' the Constitution requires. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fifth Amendment says private property can be taken for  
public use only when such compensation is paid, and a series of 
Supreme Court rulings have established that compensation sometimes 
is due even when a landowner does not lose all use of the property. 
</P>
<P>
	That line of decisions, the California court said, does not  
apply to rent control laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Its ruling came on the heels of enactment of a California law  
entitling landlords to charge whatever the market will bear when an 
apartment becomes vacant. 
</P>
<P>
	Rent control laws in Santa Monica and the other four California  
cities with so-called vacancy control -- Berkeley, West Hollywood, 
Cotati and East Palo Alto -- were affected by that law. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Santa Monica Beach Ltd. vs. Superior Court of Los  
Angeles County, 98-1512.

<HEADLINE> Gov't. Urges Local Y2K Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government began a campaign Monday to  
encourage local communities nationwide to organize meetings for 
citizens to find out how the Year 2000 computer problem might 
affect them. 
</P>
<P>
	The President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion wants America's  
cities and counties to organize ``Community Conversations,'' town 
hall-style meetings with local leaders, companies and utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	To help organize these meetings, the council is offering free a  
``toolkit,'' which can be ordered over a toll-free telephone number 
or from its Web site, www.y2k.gov. 
</P>
<P>
	The kit consists of a poster, informational video and a list of  
frequently asked questions that outlines who ought to be invited to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
	The government recommends, for example, inviting officials from  
local banks and hospitals, and executives from power, water and 
telephone companies, among others. It suggests forming of panel 
that can be questioned by citizens in the audience, or appointing a 
moderator to pose questions and encourage the audience to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
	JohnKoskinen, chairman of council, said the purpose of these  
meetings is twofold: to help citizens decide what preparations they 
need to make to prepare for the Y2K problem and to identify 
companies and organizations that aren't preparing adequately on 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``Domestically, the greatest risk we have for failures is those  
cities and counties and areas where local organizations are not 
paying enough attention to this problem -- where people are 
basically adopting a wait-and-see attitude,'' Koskinen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some trade associations have promised to encourage their members  
to send executives, if invited. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem exists because some computers originally  
programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a year could 
interpret 2000 as 1900, causing failures such as billing problems 
or utility outages. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, experts predict the effects from the Y2K problem  
will resemble scattered, regional failures similar to those 
experienced during a bad storm rather than a nationwide 
catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen said one of the earliest such meetings will be June 7  
at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The number to order the meeting toolkit is: 888-USA-4-Y2K.

<HEADLINE> Producers Say Ruling Not Pertinent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Despite the Supreme Court ruling barring  
police from bringing camera crews into private homes, the producer 
of ``COPS'' said Monday it will be ``business as usual'' for the 
show because it gets permission from those involved. 
</P>
<P>
	But police departments said the ruling has reinforced a move  
toward limits on filming and could lead to more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this may dampen officers' desire to take media with  
them. This is one more thing on the side of 'Is it worth it?''' 
said Penny Parrish, spokeswoman for the Minneapolis Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	John Langley, creator and executive producer of the Fox series  
``COPS,'' said in a statement he did ``not necessarily agree'' with 
the court's decision, which said officers could be sued for 
bringing the media onto private property during arrests or 
searches. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``we are obligated to point out, as a so-called  
ride-along show, 'COPS' routinely obtains permission when filming 
on private property and also obtains releases from everyone 
involved in the program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Langley said it will be ``business as usual'' for the show as it  
accompanies police on the beat. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Monday's ruling, police departments were tightening  
up on camera crews. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the Los Angeles Police Department reaffirmed  
guidelines barring TV crews from entering homes or other private 
property without an owner's permission. And when it comes to 
ride-along requests, a news program would get priority over a 
reality show, a police spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're satisfied with the court's ruling,'' police Lt. Anthony  
Alba said. ``We're already engaged in a media ride-along policy 
that mirrors their ruling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City officials had asked the department to clarify its policy  
following lawsuits involving the now-ended syndicated series 
``LAPD: Life on the Beat'' and the Spanish-language program 
``Placas'' (``Shields''). 
</P>
<P>
	TV crews can seek an owner's permission to film but officers  
will not assist them in doing so, Alba added. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Police Department decided several years ago to bar  
camera crews from accompanying its officers because of privacy 
concerns, said Marilyn Mode, deputy commissioner for public 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not aware of any lawsuits against the NYPD, but it  
certainly has been an issue in other jurisdictions,'' Ms. Mode 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shows that feature people in embarrassing or potentially  
criminal situations in which police are not involved won't be 
affected, said one producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Erik Nelson of Termite Art Productions, which makes such  
programs as ``Busted on the Job,'' said his company makes sure 
people sign release agreements. Other measures taken to protect 
privacy include blurring faces or omitting names. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court's unanimous decisions in cases from Montana and  
Maryland said police who carry out ``media ride-alongs'' violate 
privacy rights protected by the Constitution's Fourth Amendment.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Gunman's Mom Apologizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The mother of the teen who shot six fellow  
students at his high school apologized Monday to the victims and 
thanked the assistant principal who stopped her son from committing 
suicide when the boy put a gun in mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	In a tearful interview on CNN, Mae Dean Daniele said: ``We  
grieve for each one of you and we pray for a full recovery. ... We 
thank God that all the children are alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, Heritage High School students returned to class for  
the first time since last week's shooting and picked up their 
yearbooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Daniele's son, 15-year-old T.J. Solomon, faces 20 counts of  
aggravated assault, cruelty to children and weapons charges for 
Thursday's shootings at the suburban Atlanta school. 
</P>
<P>
	All but one of the victims have been released from the hospital;  
four attended class on Monday. The last victim hospitalized is 
expected to be released later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Daniele thanked Assistant Principal Cecil Brinkley, who  
persuaded her son to surrender after Solomon sank to his knees and 
put a .357-caliber revolver into his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will forever be grateful to him,'' said Ms. Daniele, who  
was accompanied by her husband, Robert Daniele, an executive at a 
trucking company. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's lawyer, Ed Garland, said: ``There's no question he did  
the shooting. The question that everyone wants to know the answer 
to and that we want to know the answer to is why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garland said Solomon was taking Ritalin, often prescribed for  
children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. One study 
found that some 1.5 million people ages 5 through 18, or 2.8 
percent of the nation's school-age children, take the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Garland said he would try to keep Solomon -- being held at a  
youth detention center -- in the juvenile system. District Attorney 
Richard Read wants the case moved to an adult court so he can try 
Solomon as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing on moving the case to adult court is set for June 1,  
but Garland said it will probably be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heritage High parking lot was full Monday morning, as were  
the buses bringing the students. Students were met by at least 20 
sheriff's deputies and several state troopers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really freaky and really weird with cops at every door,  
but I can't blame them for being here,'' said senior Matt Powell. 
</P>
<P>
	Katy Hinesley, a 17-year-old senior, said she did not want to  
come to school, but her mother talked her into it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hated that her career at this wonderful school would end on  
the note that it ended Thursday,'' said Ms. Hinesley's mother, Pam 
Hinesley.

<HEADLINE> NLRB Rejects N.J. Doctors' Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	After a second legal setback in its attempt to organize the  
first union for doctors in private practice, a labor union says it 
may shift gears to focus on federal legislation to support its 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Labor Relations Board on Monday rejected a petition  
on behalf of the 650 New Jersey doctors, saying they were not 
employees of an HMO. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Food and Commercial Workers Local 56, which is  
seeking to represent the doctors in collective bargaining with 
AmeriHealth Inc., declared ``a moral victory'' despite the ruling 
and said it may try another tactic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that our efforts along with the other unions have  
brought this to a head,'' said Anthony Cinaglia, president of the 
Pennsauken, N.J.-based local. ``We understand that they're 
interpreting the law very narrowly. Perhaps we need to change the 
law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case has been watched around the country as a growing number  
of doctors, frustrated by increasing control over their practices 
by health maintenance organizations, have attempted to unionize. 
</P>
<P>
	While there are other physician unions, those involve doctors  
employed directly by hospitals or clinics. The doctors in this case 
all treat patients of AmeriHealth. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has never been a question of quality care,'' AmeriHealth  
chairman and chief executive G. Fred DiBona, Jr., said in a 
statement. ``This has been a costly and time-consuming effort for 
everyone, but clarifies a question of considerable importance to 
consumers, providers and insurers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Frederick Nahas, of Somers Point, a vascular surgeon who  
helped organize colleagues to join the union, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, patients are still going to be denied care in  
lieu of profiteering that's going on by the HMOs,'' he said. 
``That's really the bottom line: HMOs are trading patient lives and 
limbs for profits,'' said Nahas. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if they are successful at unionizing, it may not be an  
answer to their problems, which revolve around stepped-up HMO 
control over their practices, said Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton 
University health economist. 
</P>
<P>
	``They think they can, as a union, sit there and shove a  
unionized fee scale down the throat of the insurer,'' said 
Reinhardt. He added that it would never be effective because 
insurance carriers in turn would band together to negotiate with 
the doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just simply can't create a physician monopoly,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Monday's ruling by Dorothy L. Moore-Duncan, NLRB regional  
director in Philadelphia, said the doctors were independent 
contractors and not employees of AmeriHealth. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Moore-Duncan had also ruled against the union last year but  
was ordered to hold a hearing after the doctors appealed. She heard 
14 days of testimony, the first hearings ever before the NLRB on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has until June 7 to request a review from the  
five-member NLRB in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 38,000 to 45,000 doctors -- about 6 percent of the  
nation's doctors -- belong to unions, up from about 25,000 two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The union filed a petition in 1997 seeking to have family  
doctors and specialists in Atlantic and Cape May counties declared 
employees of the HMO. Initially, only AmeriHealth was targeted, but 
the union had planned to target other HMOs if the strategy proved 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs have controlled skyrocketing health costs by preventing  
unneeded treatments and watching fees charged by doctors and 
hospitals. The doctors say forming a union would return their 
control over medical decisions and improve quality of care. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Medical Association, a trade group that represents  
about half of the nation's doctors, shares the doctors' complaints 
about HMOs but has long rejected traditional labor unions. AMA 
officials declined to comment on the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	AmeriHealth insisted the doctors are independent medical  
practitioners because most of their income comes from other sources 
and the doctors provide their own facilities, equipment and support 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	AmeriHealth, a subsidiary of Independence Blue Cross of  
Philadelphia, covers 270,000 New Jersey residents. 
</P>
<P>
	In her ruling, Moore-Duncan said the doctors still exert  
substantial control how they provide services to the HMO, have 
their own practices independent of the health maintenance 
organization, and have proprietary interests in their practices. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. antitrust law prohibits independent contractors from  
banding together to set prices and terms for their work, but the 
NLRB has allowed unions for some whose work primarily is dictated 
by others, including entertainers, athletes, cab drivers and, most 
recently, couriers.

<HEADLINE> NATO Targets Yugoslav Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Much of Yugoslavia was blacked out  
and water supplies seriously threatened by NATO attacks, state 
media reported today. Serb authorities urged residents to be 
patient while they rectified this ``humanitarian disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's envoy to the Balkans, meanwhile, said today that he has  
persuaded his Western counterparts to allow Yugoslavia to leave 
some troops in Kosovo as part of any potential peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has taken two or three weeks to convince our counterparts --  
the United States and (other) NATO countries -- that while 
withdrawing the (Yugoslav) troops, it's necessary to leave some of 
them behind,'' Viktor Chernomyrdin said in Moscow. Russia has 
long-standing ties to the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has considered allowing Serb troops to guard some  
historical sites in Kosovo, but continues to demand all forces 
leave the southern Serb province as a condition for ending 
airstrikes that began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott or Finnish  
President Martti Ahtisaari said anything about the alleged 
agreement after talks with Chernomyrdin last week. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his ongoing mediation efforts, Chernomyrdin said he  
will hold more talks with Talbott and Ahtisaari on Wednesday and 
travel to the Yugoslav capital on Thursday with Ahtisaari to meet 
with President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	During Chernomyrdin's trip to Belgrade last week, Milosevic said  
he was still against pulling all his troops out of Kosovo and 
allowing an international armed force with NATO at its core to 
control the province. 
</P>
<P>
	On the diplomatic front, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer  
departed today for Washington where he is to meet with Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright to discuss ways to accelerate a possible 
political solution to the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Diplomatic efforts are reaching a decisive point,'' said  
Ludger Volmer, a state secretary in the German Foreign Ministry. 
``The difficulty is that many actors must by in synch to take a 
courageous step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Western leaders expressed confidence that the air campaign  
was putting pressure on Milosevic to give up control of Kosovo, 
more than 20,000 ethnic Albanians fled over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials in neighboring Macedonia today spoke of what  
looked like a final drive to clear ethnic Albanians out of the 
province 
</P>
<P>
	``You could call it the last push,'' said Astrid Van Genderen  
Stort, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
``We don't know for certain how many people are left in Kosovo, but 
we've seen a massive influx.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions soared Sunday night when Macedonian authorities tried  
to divert hundreds of new arrivals from Kosovo into neighboring 
Albania by bus. U.N. officials protested and after an hours-long 
standoff, the refugees were allowed to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	In Albania, where an estimated 438,000 people from Kosovo have  
fled since airstrikes began, more than 1,000 Kosovo refugees had 
crossed the border by midday today, according to the UNHCR. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at NATO headquarters, meanwhile, said alliance  
aircraft flew 554 sorties overnight despite poor weather. Targets 
included power plants, ammunition dumps and broadcast relay 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	In Serbia, 15 NATO bombs hit water pumps early today near the  
northwestern town of Sremska Mitrovica for the second night in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgrade was down to its last 10 percent of water reserves  
because of damaged pumping stations and a power outage, which cut 
electricity to the few water pumps still working, media reported. 
Two ``destructive'' missiles hit the Kostolac power plant, 20 miles 
east of Belgrade, reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	The main outages began early Saturday after attacks on a power  
station near Belgrade. NATO continued to hit power stations, among 
other targets, Sunday and today, causing extensive outages in 
Yugoslavia's three main cities -- Belgrade, Novi Sad and Nis. 
</P>
<P>
	Some areas of Belgrade had electricity today, but the supply was  
erratic and authorities were trying to give priority to hospitals. 
This is not the first time the power supply has been hit, but it 
may be the most sustained and heavy attack on the electrical grid 
so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb media say NATO is using more destructive bombs against  
power stations instead of the so-called soft bombs that spread 
carbon-fiber filaments designed to short-out systems without doing 
extensive long-term damage. That makes it harder to restore power. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every effort is being made in this difficult situation to  
restore power supply to priority users -- hospitals, the water 
company, bakeries -- in order to alleviate the humanitarian disaster 
being caused by NATO,'' Serbia's power company told the state news 
agency Tanjug. 
</P>
<P>
	Blic, a Belgrade daily, published statistics today from Nis  
saying 32 civilians have died and 210 were wounded there from NATO 
attacks. In addition, it said 50,000 people -- one-fourth of the 
city's population -- were idled because factories were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides demanding that Milosevic withdraw his security forces  
from Kosovo, NATO is insisting he permit the return of more than 
800,000 ethnic Albanian refugees of the 2.1 million Kosovo prewar 
populace who have fled or been deported. 
</P>
<P>
	While many NATO members remain reluctant to add a ground  
invasion to the air campaign, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook 
said Sunday that NATO must prepare to deploy troops ``in a 
permissive or a non-permissive environment.''

<HEADLINE> Wrestler Dies During WWF Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- This was not the first time that pro  
wrestler Owen Hart was making his entrance into the ring by being 
lowered from the rafters as the high-flying ``Blue Blazer,'' with 
the feathers of his sky-blue costume fluttering in the arena 
lights. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Sunday night, something went wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old member of a legendary Canadian wrestling family  
fell 90 feet from the ceiling of Kemper Arena. His head hit a 
padded turnbuckle, a metal coupling that holds the ring's ropes 
together, and snapped backward. He was pronounced dead at a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's death happened in front of 16,200 fans in the arena, and  
many thought the fall was part of the staged theatrics that have 
helped fuel the explosion of popularity in pro wrestling in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Wrestling Federation's pay-per-view national TV  
audience was watching archive footage and did not see Hart fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Homicide detectives on Monday were inspecting the rigging that  
was to lower Hart by cable from the arena catwalk and talking to 
the stagehands to determine what went wrong, police spokesman Floyd 
Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said the cable did not break, and detectives believe  
something went wrong when Hart's harness was being hitched to the 
cable. WWF President Vince McMahon Jr. said he believes Hart may 
have accidentally pulled a release mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
	McMahon said WWF wrestlers will stop performing the aerial move  
that killed Hart, but said other stunts will continue. The WWF, 
which admits its events are more entertainment than sport, is one 
of the biggest draws on cable and pay-per-view TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stunts like this are performed at major sporting events on a  
routine basis in Hollywood,'' he said. ``We compete with Hollywood 
for entertainment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WWF canceled plans to replay the tape of Sunday's  
pay-per-view program on Tuesday and Thursday. It also called off 
upcoming live events in Peoria, Ill.; Winnipeg, Manitoba; Hamilton, 
Ontario; Montreal and Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	But a WWF event went on as planned Monday night in St. Louis,  
where a crowd of 19,000 jammed the Kiel Center for a ``Raw is War'' 
show that included a tribute to Hart. 
</P>
<P>
	Tears streamed down the faces of many wrestlers, fans, even  
referees, as 10 bells tolled in Hart's honor and as videotape of 
him appeared on a huge video screen. Many of the wrestlers wore 
black armbands with ``OH'' on them. The crowd of 19,000 people 
chanted ``Owen, Owen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart was the youngest son of Stu Hart, a member of Canada's  
Olympic wrestling team in the 1940s. All seven of Stu Hart's sons 
went into wrestling, including Bret ``The Hitman'' Hart, a World 
Championship Wrestling star who canceled an appearance Monday on 
``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's mother, Helen, told the Calgary (Alberta) Herald that she  
always feared one of her sons would be disabled in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a dangerous sport in more ways than you can know,'' she  
said. ``I just never thought one of my boys would be killed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 feet 11 inches and 227 pounds, Hart was billed as an  
acrobatic stuntman who acted as a foil for WWF heavyweights. Hart 
had been a high-profile character when he broke into wrestling 10 
years ago, but he was recast as a plain, straightforward wrestler, 
in contrast to charismatic personalities such as ``Stone Cold'' 
Steve Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	``His shtick was he really didn't have one,'' said Dave Meltzer,  
editor of the Wrestling Observer newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart had been lowered by cable into the ring before, and other  
wrestlers have done it dozens of times, Meltzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some audience members initially thought the fall was part of the  
act. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it was a doll at first,'' said Robert McCome, 15.  
``We thought they were just playing with us. We were really shocked 
when we found out that it was no joke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While paramedics attended to Hart, the arena announcer haltingly  
told the hushed crowd the incident was not scripted. The event 
resumed about 15 minutes after he was taken away. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans watching on TV were told of Hart's death about an hour  
after it happened, Meltzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade Keller, editor of the Pro Wrestling Torch newsletter, said  
it was the first fatal accident he knew of in U.S. wrestling since 
1969, when Mike DiBiase died of a heart attack during a match in 
Lubbock, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Schmelzle, general manager of Kemper Arena, said the WWF  
asked him not to discuss the fall. Local stagehands assisted on the 
catwalk, but WWF employees were in charge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, a former WWF wrestler, called the  
Harts ``a legendary family of wrestling'' and said Hart's death was 
a reminder that wrestling is a tough job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe people ought to start thinking about respecting them a  
little more,'' Ventura said. ``These performers give their heart 
and soul to their job.''

<HEADLINE> Wrestler Killed During WWF Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- With thousands of pro wrestling fans  
watching, a 33-year-old scion of a Canadian wrestling family 
plunged 50 feet to his death as he was being lowered by cable from 
Kemper Arena's ceiling into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Owen Hart, who wrestled under the nickname ``Blue Blazer,'' was  
given CPR inside the ring as the announcer haltingly told Sunday 
night's crowd the incident was not scripted. 
</P>
<P>
	The event was on pay-per-view national television, drawing an  
estimated audience of 400,000, but the fall was not shown. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Wrestling Federation event resumed about 15 minutes  
later, after Hart was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We at the WWF are saddened by the tragic accident that  
occurred here tonight,'' federation president Vince McMahon Jr. 
said. ``We have no answers as to how this happened yet. We will 
shortly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some witnesses said the cable snapped; others said it appeared  
Hart was somehow disconnected from it. They said his head snapped 
backward when he hit one of the padded pieces of metal that hold 
the ropes together in each corner of the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it was a doll at first,'' said 15-year-old Robert  
McCome. ``We thought they were just playing with us. We were really 
shocked when we found out that it was no joke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse McDonald, who was sitting near the ring, said Hart's chin  
and neck hit the top rope. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Sgt. Patrick Witcher said investigators were trying to  
determine what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the information we have so far, it had something to do  
with the harness system,'' Witcher said this morning. ``Everyone's 
talking about something happening with the rigging, but it's still 
under investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy was planned.  
</P>
<P>
	Hart's fell during the second part of the event called ``Over  
the Edge.'' The TV audience was being shown clips of his career. 
The first part, ``Sunday Night Heat,'' was televised live on 
cable's USA Network. After he fell, the camera panned through the 
hushed crowd of 14,000 while paramedics worked on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened kind of was really a mirror image to a circus  
going wrong, with someone falling off the high wire, or falling off 
the trapeze,'' Chris Jericho, a star with rival World Championship 
Wrestling, told Toronto radio station The Fan. ``That's the way you 
can sum up what we do. We're almost a live-action circus act. And 
tonight one of our guys fell off the high wire, and the net didn't 
catch him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart, known for his acrobatic stunts, is the son of former  
wrestler Stu Hart. All seven of the elder Hart's sons went into 
wrestling, including Bret ``The Hitman'' Hart, a WCW star. Bret 
Hart canceled a planned appearance tonight on ``The Tonight Show 
With Jay Leno.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't get up 60 or 70 feet in the air without being  
properly anchored down,'' the 83-year-old father said from his home 
in Calgary, Alberta. ``I haven't talked to Vince McMahon yet, but 
somebody was careless or missed something or else Owen would still 
be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WWF is one of the biggest draws on cable and pay-per-view  
TV, but critics say the matches often are sexist, homophobic and 
violent. The WWF admits its events are more entertainment then 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart, who joined professional wrestling in 1989, had recently  
told a magazine that he was planning to leave it when his contract 
was up. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Martha, and two young children.  
</P>
<P>
	``Wrestlers were openly weeping last night,'' a tearful McMahon  
told KMBZ-TV this morning as wrestlers boarded a plane at Kansas 
City International Airport for St. Louis. USA Network said the live 
WWF event out of St. Louis would be televised as planned tonight 
and would include a look at Hart's career. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, a former WWF wrestler, said he was  
deeply saddened at the death, adding, ``It is difficult to receive 
news of a loss of a friend. It is even more difficult to accept 
when that person dies tragically and at such a young age.''

<HEADLINE> Jazz Out of Tune Against Blazers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Utah Jazz are watching their  
championship dreams wither before their eyes, and they don't know 
what to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the Utah Jazz lost three games in a row, they were  
in the 1998 NBA Finals. But in dropping three straight to the Trail 
Blazers over a four-day span, the Jazz didn't look much like a team 
that can return there. 
</P>
<P>
	And now Utah is down to its last chance to shake this postseason  
funk. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland visits the Delta Center on Tuesday night for Game 5 in  
the best-of-7 second-round series. Up 3-1, the Blazers have three 
chances to eliminate the Jazz and advance to face San Antonio in 
the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Most observers thought this shortened season would be the last  
best chance for Karl Malone, John Stockton and company to win the 
title that has eluded them for over a decade. Now, it will take a 
miraculous three-game winning streak for the Jazz to climb out of 
the hole they have dug -- and even then, the Spurs await. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're up against it now,'' Jazz guard Jeff Hornacek said. ``We  
put ourselves in this situation, and now we have to see if we can 
get out of it. How? Well, we need everything, sort of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After three games in four days, the Jazz didn't practice Monday.  
Coach Jerry Sloan hoped a day off might give one more injection of 
rest for his aging, ailing team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers worked out in Portland before flying to Salt Lake,  
where Utah is 3-4 in its last seven home playoff games. If 
necessary, Game 6 will be Thursday at the Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since their blowout of Sacramento in the first game of the  
first round, the Jazz have mostly played miserably during the 
playoffs, and there's no single reason why. Utah is 3-5 in its last 
eight games, and two of those wins came only when the Kings missed 
shots that could have won it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz's scoring is down, their defense has trouble keeping up  
with young legs, and their big men have done nothing. Even Stockton 
has missed two critical layups in the final minute of close games 
against the Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah is shooting 43 percent as a team, and its scoring average  
is down to 90.3 points per game, a number that's significantly 
raised by the 117 points the Jazz scored in Game 1 against 
Sacramento. As one of the league's highest-scoring teams over the 
last decade with a normally reliable offense, those numbers are 
disheartening. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would really help if we were hitting our shots and scoring  
more points,'' Hornacek said. ``We've been struggling on offense, 
and it hasn't got any better. We're just not making open shots, and 
everybody shares in that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uncharacteristic mental mistakes, like Bryon Russell's throwaway  
in the closing seconds of Game 4, have dogged Utah. Malone, who 
might win his second Most Valuable Player award this season, also 
has played poorly, shooting 42.6 percent and disappearing down the 
stretch in Games 2 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have counted us out before, and we've proved them  
wrong,'' Malone said. ``We're going to get it going, no matter what 
it takes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it may take more than the Jazz have to offer. The Blazers  
are riding high after playing poorly themselves in Game 4 before 
stopping the Jazz on three critical possessions in the final two 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good to be up 3-1, but we're not satisfied with  
that,'' guard Damon Stoudamire said. ``We know that we've got to 
close the deal now. We've got to be finishers and get our game 
tight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After three straight wins, the already confident Blazers are  
sounding downright cocky. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look back at the whole series, they should have been  
swept,'' Isaiah Rider said Sunday. ``We gave that first game 
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is consolation in the fact the Jazz often play well when  
cornered. They are 5-1 in their last six games in which they faced 
elimination, including their rally for a 3-2 series win over 
Sacramento in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	But as poorly as Utah has played against Portland, is there any  
reason to believe the Jazz can pull off one more playoff escape? 
</P>
<P>
	``I never say never. That word isn't even in my vocabulary,''  
Malone said.

<HEADLINE> Study Compares Heart Beta Blockers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The newest drug on the market for treating  
congestive heart failure is no more effective than a much older one 
that costs only one-third as much, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The drugs are called beta blockers, and they reduce the heart's  
workload. 
</P>
<P>
	The newest beta blocker, carvedilol, was approved by the Food  
and Drug Administration in 1997. But a direct comparison with 
metoprolol, a now-generic beta blocker that has been on the market 
since 1978, found that the two have equal benefits in treating 
heart failure patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was led by Dr. Marrick L. Kukin, director of the heart  
failure program at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. It was 
published in Tuesday's issue of Circulation, a journal of the 
American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was paid for in part by SmithKline Beecham of  
Philadelphia, which makes carvedilol, also known by the brand name 
Coreg. 
</P>
<P>
	Beta blockers work by blocking the body's response to the high  
levels of stress-related hormones that pour into the bloodstream of 
heart failure patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukin said metoprolol blocks one the body's two types of beta  
receptors, while carvedilol blocks both and was also thought to be 
the only one to boost levels of antioxidants. Antioxidants help 
prevent the fatty buildups in the blood vessels that can trigger a 
heart attack or stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	The study involved 46 men and 21 women, ages 29 to 97, who had  
congestive heart failure. After six months, researchers found the 
drugs had similar results in increasing stamina, improving the 
heart's pumping ability and boosting levels of antioxidants. 
</P>
<P>
	The dosages of metoprolol used in the study would cost patients  
about $23 per month. Carvedilol costs at least three times as much, 
Kukin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Neil Shusterman, a cardiologist at SmithKline Beecham, said  
previous research has shown carvedilol is more effective in 
improving heart and kidney function and reducing enlargement of the 
heart. The new study did not look at some of those factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Shusterman said he wants to see a longer-term study involving  
large numbers of patients.

<HEADLINE> Report: China Controls U.S. Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a blurring of commerce and  
intelligence-gathering, China clandestinely controls several 
thousand U.S. ``front companies'' to obtain American technology for 
military purposes, a congressional report says. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also concludes that China has diverted civilian  
technology from high-speed computers to missiles for launching 
satellites to improve its military weapons programs, congressional 
sources familiar with the study said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings of the 700-page document will be released Tuesday  
by a special House committee investigating espionage and U.S. 
technology losses to China. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, about one-third of which remains classified, will  
characterize a voracious appetite by China for American know-how -- 
from nuclear secrets at U.S. weapons laboratories to satellite and 
computer technology it obtained through business and academic 
contacts. 
</P>
<P>
	The report describes a ``blurring of commerce and intelligence  
operations'' by China that poses an unprecedented challenge to U.S. 
efforts to keep China from getting America's military-related 
secrets, said congressional sources quoting from a portion of the 
document. 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan panel, known formally as the House Select  
Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial 
Concerns with the People's Republic of China, has been looking into 
China's technology gains for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
	It will say that:  
</P>
<P>
	--Chinese espionage at U.S. weapons labs over more than 20 years  
has led to nuclear secrets being lost about two key warheads that 
will allow China to accelerate its nuclear weapons modernization. 
</P>
<P>
	--Two U.S. companies -- Loral and Hughes Aircraft -- went ``outside  
the scope'' of their export licenses and provided China with 
information that will help improve the reliability of China's 
nuclear missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	--Chinese espionage at nuclear labs and elsewhere led to the loss  
of electronic guidance and submarine detection technology. 
</P>
<P>
	While much of the espionage cited by the report dated back to  
the 1980s and previous administrations, the report said some losses 
of military secrets continued into the late 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was approved unanimously by the committee in late  
December, but its release was delayed for months because of 
disagreements over how much of it should be kept classified. About 
70 percent of the original report is being made public, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also describes problems with lax security at the  
weapons labs and says despite recent improvements, 
counterintelligence programs will not be what they should be until 
sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The report contends that the espionage threat from China is much  
broader than the infiltration of the weapons labs, encompassing a 
broad array of technology-related businesses and academia. 
</P>
<P>
	There is evidence, the report concludes, that China has been  
using -- and continues to use -- an extensive network of both small 
and large businesses operated by Chinese nationals in the United 
States to penetrate civilian technology centers. 
</P>
<P>
	There may be more than 3,000 such American ``front companies'' --  
many concentrated in high-tech centers in California and New 
England -- with connections to the Chinese intelligence apparatus, 
the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the congressional panel concluded, China requires  
as a normal practice that many of the thousands of students, 
tourists and other Chinese visitors to the United States to seek 
out bits of information that might be used for military purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not providing specifics, Rep. Norman Dicks of Washington,  
the ranking Democrat on the committee, said it is clear that China 
uses an array of businesses and contacts at universities to gather 
technology information. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's touring groups or front companies or actual  
companies or scientific exchanges, they have a very diffuse system 
of collecting intelligence,'' Dicks said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., the  
committee's chairman, said Chinese espionage ``has been occurring 
for some decades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``More importantly,'' he continued, his committee's findings  
will say that ``it continues ... to this very day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the  
security labs' shortcomings go back through both Republican and 
Democratic administrations and defended the administration's 
response to the security problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House ``has moved quickly to try to address it,'' he  
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	To Republican and some Democratic demands for Attorney General  
Janet Reno's resignation, Lockhart said the president ``has 
confidence in the attorney general and will continue to have 
confidence in her.'' Reno made clear to reporters at the Justice 
Department that she does not plan to resign. ``I'm right here, 
going strong,'' she said.	   As to China's intentions, Lockhart said, ``We're under no 
illusion that one of the byproducts of being technological leader 
in the world is that other people, other countries, who don't have 
the technological prowess that we do, will try to acquire them one 
way or another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The select committee -- five Republicans and four Democrats --  
began its investigation nearly a year ago. Its focus was on 
technology transfers to China, particularly satellite and computer 
technology, and to what extent civilian sales were diverted to 
military use. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, according to committee members, the focus shifted  
dramatically when the panel learned of a major loss of nuclear 
secrets at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico to the 
problems of espionage at the weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the committee heard complaints from a senior  
Energy Department intelligence officer, Notra Trulock, that he had 
been stymied in his attempts to bring the espionage loss and 
security problems at the labs to the attention of senior Clinton 
administration officials.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Prosecutors issued an arrest warrant  
Monday for feared paramilitary boss Carlos Castano in the 1990 
slaying of a charismatic leftist presidential candidate. 
</P>

	Chief prosecutor Alfonso Gomez linked Castano and his brother  
Fidel to the April 1990 murder of Carlos Pizarro, a former 
guerrilla chief who had demobilized months before he was 
assassinated on the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
	The Castano brothers, charged with murder and conspiracy in the  
Pizarro killing, have already been indicted for a series of 
slayings, including the 1990 assassination of another ex-guerrilla 
presidential candidate, Bernardo Jaramillo of the Patriotic Union 
party.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A sixth member of President Hugo  
Chavez's Cabinet has resigned to run for a constituent assembly 
that will rewrite Venezuela's constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez announced Agriculture Minister Alejandro Riera's  
resignation Sunday during a nationally broadcast radio talk show. 
He will be replaced by Juan Montilla, head of the national science 
and technology institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Riera joins Chavez's chief of staff and his interior,  
environment, labor and infrastructure ministers in becoming 
candidates for the July 25 election. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignations are part of an attempt by Chavez to keep the  
opposition from controlling the constituent assembly, which the 
president has made the centerpiece of his governing agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	He says a new constitution is needed to clean up political  
corruption, trim a bloated bureaucracy and reduce mass poverty.

	SAN CRISTOBAL, Mexico (AP) -- There have been new desertions from  
the Zapatista rebel army, Chiapas state officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	State prosecutor Eduardo Montoya Lievano said eight members of  
the Zapatista National Liberation Army surrendered their guns to 
authorities Sunday in the mountains near Ocosingo in exchange for 
aid for their communities. 
</P>
<P>
	It follows other cases publicized as Zapatista desertions. On  
March 29, 14 men turned in weapons to authorities at a river near 
Ocosingo. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zapatista leader Subcomandante Marcos said last week that  
masked men presented as Zapatistas had been used repeatedly in 
``desertions'' and had given false identities and hometowns to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zapatista rebels are demanding that the government pay  
greater attention and give more autonomy to Chiapas' poor Indian 
communities. Peace talks have been stalled since 1996.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- At least 9,000 Peruvians fear detention  
because of arrest warrants for terrorism pending against them six 
years after political violence fell sharply, a human rights group 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government imprisoned thousands of suspected leftist Shining  
Path and Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement rebels and issued 
arrest warrants for thousands more during a bloody war that has 
left 30,000 dead since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the capture of rebel leaders in the early 1990s and the  
near end of the war, the arrest warrants remain on the books, 
forcing those accused to live in fear, said Jose Ramirez of Peru's 
Pro-Human Rights Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez said the government should review the warrants because  
most named are innocent and often cannot get jobs, travel freely or 
vote because of the warrants.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally mixed  
Monday, with prices rising in Tokyo and Hong Kong, but slumping in 
Kuala Lumpur and Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 97.51  
points, or 0.60 percent, closing the day's trading at 16,390.49 
points. On Friday, the average closed up 92.99 points, or 0.57 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo market opened moderately weaker on futures-led  
profit-taking and hedge selling, but soon rebounded on the view 
that the downside remains solid. After modest fluctuations, the 
Nikkei average moved into positive territory toward the closing 
bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar edged higher against the yen despite  
profit-taking in reaction to last week's surge to seven-month 
highs. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 124.04 yen in late afternoon trading,  
up 0.28 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its level of 
124.01 yen late Friday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong rebounded after three straight  
sessions of declines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 164.72 points, or 1.3 percent, to 12,436.86. On 
Friday, the index had slumped 103.28 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said bargain-hunting pushed prices higher following  
recent declines that were triggered by worries over a possible rise 
in interest rates in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Any change in U.S. rates usually leads to a similar move in Hong  
Kong because the local currency is linked to the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian shares closed sharply higher as foreign and local  
funds bought stocks in reaction to the smooth start of the 
country's election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose 3.7 percent,  
or 21.977, to close at a 22-month high of 613.641. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia will hold general elections on June 7.  
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian shares closed sharply lower as retailers took profit  
following spectacular gains last week, traders said. The benchmark 
Composite Index, which tracks 100 blue-chip stocks, fell 26.45 
points, or 3.4 percent, to 743.34. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean share prices closed sharply lower in reaction to  
the fall of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. A weaker yen 
undermines the competitiveness of South Korean companies against 
Japanese rivals in key industries such as semiconductors, steel and 
shipbuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 14.89 points, or 2.1  
percent, to 695.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher on bargain-hunting,  
triggered by a fresh cut in key central bank overnight rates. The 
30-company Philippine Stock Exchange rose 28.34 points, or 1.2 
percent, to 2,405.47. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mixed as institutional players  
took a cautious approach to the market. The Straits Times Index 
fell 1.1 percent, or 20.50 points, to 1,932.80. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower. The market's key Weighted  
Stock Price Index fell 18.46 points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,588.23. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly higher. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 8.14 points, or 0.3 percent, 
to 2,156.97. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed marginally lower on very  
thin volume, with most investors choosing to sit on the sidelines, 
dealers said. The All Ordinaries Index slipped 1.5 points to 
2,949.2. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court OKs Runoff Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today rejected a challenge  
to Georgia's requiring political candidates to attract more than 50 
percent of the vote in primary elections to avoid runoffs with 
their closest competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that said the  
majority-vote requirement does not discriminate against black 
voters and candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The requirement affects races in which more than two candidates  
are vying for one post. If three people ran for the same 
congressional seat, the winning candidate would have to attract 
over 50 percent of the votes to avoid a runoff against the 
second-place candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight other states require majority-vote victories in primary  
elections. They are Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia long required candidates in all elections -- primary and  
general -- to attract a majority of the votes cast to be declared 
the outright winner. The state Legislature repealed that law and 
replaced it in 1994 with a 45-percent requirement for most general 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	But the majority-vote requirement was kept for primary elections  
for members of Congress and the state Legislature, state judges and 
single-member county offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-seven black voters sued the state, contending that the  
majority-vote requirement for primary elections violated the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 because it had both a racially discriminatory 
purpose and impact. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal trial judge upheld the law in 1996, and a three-judge  
panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority-vote requirement ... was not motivated by a  
discriminatory purpose,'' the appeals court said, ruling that it 
also ``does not yield racially discriminatory results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the black voters  
argued that ``evidence that the majority-vote requirement 
discouraged blacks from running for office was substantial and 
unrebutted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``By contrast,'' the appeal said, ``there was no evidence that  
whites were similarly discouraged from running for office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Brooks vs. Barnes, 98-1521.

<HEADLINE> Cherokee Nation Will Hold Runoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAHLEQUAH, Okla. (AP) -- The Cherokee Nation will hold a runoff  
election this summer to choose a chief, a vote considered a key 
step toward ending turmoil in the government of the nation's 
second-largest tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	Incumbent chief Joe Byrd finished first among nine candidates  
with 32 percent -- or 4,140 votes -- during Saturday's election. 
Challenger Chad Smith received 19 percent, or 2,535 votes, and 
candidate Pat Ragsdale placed third with 16 percent, or 2,162 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd and Smith will face each other in a July 24 runoff, when a  
deputy chief will also be selected. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronic voting devices were used for the first time Saturday  
by the Cherokee Nation, which has 200,000 members and is second in 
size only to the Navajo Nation. Half of its 26,000 registered 
voters cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the outcome was unusual.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is in the Cherokee tradition to vote for the incumbent,''  
he said. ``But in other chief races, we didn't have to go through a 
runoff. This is a very big victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many candidates have been key figures in a government feud.  
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Ragsdale was tribal marshal until Byrd fired him  
in 1997 for serving a search warrant on Cherokee administrative 
offices, then alleging impropriety. And Smith, a lawyer, was 
arrested when he tried to stop Byrd's administration from closing 
the tribe's courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Interior Secretary attempted to negotiate a truce, but  
the conflicts continued with millions of federal dollars 
unaccounted for and boycotts of tribal meetings.

<HEADLINE> Settlement With DeLorean Trustee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A long-running lawsuit on behalf of DeLorean  
Motor Co.'s creditors has been settled, marking the end of the 
defunct automaker's financial battles. 
</P>
<P>
	Accounting firm Arthur Andersen has agreed to pay $27.8 million  
as part of a settlement on behalf of DeLorean's creditors, DeLorean 
trustee David W. Allard Jr. said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is an excellent settlement for the creditors,''  
Allard said. ``The creditors that I've spoken to are exceedingly 
pleased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the settlement, reached today, will take care of about  
90 percent of the roughly 260 creditors' bills. Except for a few 
loose ends, he said this marks the end of the litigation on behalf 
of the creditors that began more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLorean owed an estimated $86 million to creditors when  
litigation began. Through previous paybacks, that figure dropped to 
$78 million -- $60 million of which was owed to the company's two 
largest creditors, Allard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's settlement is subject to approval in bankruptcy court  
in Detroit, which is where the bankruptcy court filing was 
originally made, Arthur Andersen spokesman Robert Hubbell said. It 
is expected to take 30 to 60 days for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit -- first filed in federal court in 1985 -- stemmed  
from allegations that Andersen signed off on DeLorean's financial 
statements despite potential evidence of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1998, a New York State Supreme Court jury found in  
favor of DeLorean's trustee, ordering Arthur Andersen to pay $46.2 
million. The accounting firm had filed a motion asking the court to 
set aside the verdict, but the two sides reached the settlement 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	John DeLorean's car manufacturing enterprise went bankrupt 17  
years ago, leaving a trail of unpaid bills. Plaintiff-creditors had 
suggested that DeLorean ripped off millions, and that Arthur 
Andersen auditors knew about it or should have. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLorean never has been convicted of fraud and Arthur Andersen  
has admitted no wrongdoing. In the settlement, the firm did not 
admit any liability. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate related lawsuit, the British government sued  
Arthur Andersen in 1985, alleging the accountants should have done 
more to warn the government about DeLorean's financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Economic Development, which is the successor  
to the Industrial Development Board of Northern Ireland received a 
settlement in that suit in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s, DeLorean Motor Co. formed a subsidiary in Belfast,  
Northern Ireland, and the British government poured $160 million 
into it via grants and loans based on the promise of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates of the payout Andersen was to make to the government  
ranged from $31 million to $37 million.

<HEADLINE> Court: Ride-Alongs Violate Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police can be sued for letting TV camera crews  
and other journalists accompany them into people's homes to observe 
arrests or searches, the Supreme Court ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanimous decisions in cases from Montana and Maryland said  
police who authorize and carry out such ``media ride-alongs'' 
violate privacy rights protected by the Constitution's Fourth 
Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a violation of the Fourth Amendment for police to bring  
members of the media or other third parties into a home during the 
execution of a warrant when the presence of the third parties in 
the home was not in aid of the execution of the warrant,'' Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the nation's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a scene repeated countless times daily across America:  
Police officers burst into a house or some other private place and 
seek their quarry. A court-issued warrant or emergency 
circumstances give police that authority, but lower courts had 
disagreed whether police may take the news media with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardly new, such ride-alongs have been given higher visibility  
in recent years by true-life television programs focusing on police 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's decision means law enforcement officers can be forced to  
pay monetary damages for violating the Fourth Amendment's ban on 
unreasonable searches and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	Still pending before the justices is an important related issue:  
Can the journalists be punished financially, too? 
</P>
<P>
	But the court, by an 8-1 vote, ruled also that allowing such  
news media access was not ``clearly established'' as 
unconstitutional back in 1992 and 1993, when the raids in Maryland 
and Montana occurred, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Therefore, the court said, the law enforcement officials  
involved in those incidents are immune from the ensuing lawsuits 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
	News media lawyers contend that reporters on such assignments  
provide a valuable public service by detailing police work, but 
critics call the ride-alongs nothing more than government publicity 
stunts producing fodder for tabloid television. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four news organizations, including The Associated Press,  
sided with law enforcement officers in the Maryland and Montana 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the cases were argued before the court in March, most  
of the justices seemed determined to stop police from continuing 
the practice. At one point, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor called one 
such raid ``an amazing invasion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Justice David H. Souter declared, ``I don't see why you have  
to take the news media people into someone's home. ... It sounds 
like fluff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was more muted but hit on those same sentiments.  
</P>
<P>
	``Surely, the possibility of good public relations for the  
police is simply not enough, standing alone, to justify the 
ride-along intrusion into a private home,'' Rehnquist said. ``And 
even the need for accurate reporting on police issues in general 
bears no direct relation to the constitutional justification for 
the police intrusion into a home in order to execute a ... 
warrant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision comes at a time when some police departments are  
taking steps to restrict news media access during police raids. For 
example, Los Angeles Police Department guidelines issued in March 
bar TV camera crews from entering homes and other private property 
without owners' permission. 
</P>
<P>
	The court spelled out its constitutional rationale in deciding  
the Maryland case. In it, Montgomery County sheriff's deputies and 
deputy U.S. marshals took along a Washington Post reporter and 
photographer when they entered the Rockville home of Charles and 
Geraldine Wilson early one morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The photographs, one showing Wilson clad only in his undershorts  
with a police officer's gun to his head, never were published. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers had been wanting to arrest the Wilsons' fugitive  
adult son, who was not at their home. He turned himself in later 
that day at the urging of his parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the Wilsons'  
lawsuit against the county and federal officers. That dismissal was 
upheld today as the justices concluded that the constitutional 
mandate was unclear until today's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	A brief decision spelled the same fate for the Montana lawsuit,  
filed by a husband and wife against federal agents and a prosecutor 
who let a Cable News Network reporter and camera crew accompany 
them during a raid on the couple's ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul and Erma Berger sued after about 20 U.S. Fish and Wildlife  
Service agents rushed onto their sheep and cattle ranch searching 
for evidence of eagle poisoning. Berger was acquitted of all 
charges except improper use of a pesticide, a minor offense. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN eventually used footage of the raid as part of its coverage  
of government efforts to protect endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Bergers  
could sue the government officials involved in the raid as well as 
CNN. The cable network's Supreme Court appeal has not yet been 
acted on. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Justice John Paul Stevens voted to let both lawsuits  
proceed to trial. He said the constitutional violations were clear 
back in 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are Hanlon vs. Berger, 97-1927, and Wilson vs. Layne,  
98-83.

<HEADLINE> Study Compares Heart Beta Blockers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The latest drug for treating congestive heart  
failure is no more effective than a much older one that costs only 
one-third as much, researchers reported in today's issue of 
Circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The drugs are called beta blockers, and they reduce the heart's  
workload. 
</P>
<P>
	The newest beta blocker, carvedilol, was approved by the Food  
and Drug Administration in 1997. But a direct comparison with 
metoprolol, a now-generic beta blocker that has been on the market 
since 1978, found that the two have equal benefits in treating 
heart failure patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was led by Dr. Marrick Kukin, director of the heart  
failure program at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. It was 
paid for in part by SmithKline Beecham, which makes carvedilol, 
known by the brand name Coreg. 
</P>
<P>
	Beta blockers work by blocking the body's response to the high  
levels of stress-related hormones that pour into the bloodstream of 
heart failure patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukin said metoprolol blocks one the body's two types of beta  
receptors, while carvedilol blocks both and was also thought to be 
the only one to boost levels of antioxidants. Antioxidants help 
prevent the fatty buildups in the blood vessels that can trigger a 
heart attack or stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	The study involved 46 men and 21 women, ages 29 to 97, who had  
congestive heart failure. After six months, researchers found the 
drugs had similar results in increasing stamina, improving the 
heart's pumping ability and boosting levels of antioxidants. 
</P>
<P>
	The dosages of metoprolol used in the study would cost patients  
about $23 per month. Carvedilol costs at least three times as much, 
Kukin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Neil Shusterman, a cardiologist at SmithKline Beecham, said  
previous research has shown carvedilol is more effective in 
improving heart and kidney function and reducing enlargement of the 
heart. The new study did not look at some of those factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Shusterman said he wants to see a longer-term study involving  
large numbers of patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Circulation is a journal of the American Heart Association.

<HEADLINE>  Belgian Film Wins Top Cannes Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- In a ceremony full of the surprises for  
which Cannes has become known, a small Belgian film about a young 
woman struggling to find a job and a place in the world took top 
honors at the 52nd annual film festival. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rosetta,'' awarded the Golden Palm on Sunday evening, was the  
fourth film by the brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne. Their 
18-year-old star, Emilie Dequenne, won the best actress award for 
her very first screen role, sharing it with Severine Caneele of the 
French film ``Humanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Best actor went to Caneele's co-star, Emmanuel Schotte. Neither  
were professional actors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Humanity,'' a slow-moving, sexually explicit tale of a  
small-town cop investigating a sordid murder, also won the Grand 
Prize, second place after the Golden Palm. It was directed by Bruno 
Dumont. 
</P>
<P>
	But by far, the most popular award of the night was the best  
director prize given to Spain's Pedro Almodovar for his ``All About 
My Mother.'' He was the only winner to receive a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Almodovar's 13th film was a big favorite with critics at Cannes.  
It impressed audiences with its balance of tragedy and humor and 
its quartet of absorbing female characters: a resilient single 
mother, a transvestite, an impressionable young nun and a lesbian 
actress. 
</P>
<P>
	In his acceptance speech, Almodovar paid tribute to his  
actresses, and also to three directors whom many felt should have 
been among the winners: Americans David Lynch for ``The Straight 
Story,'' Jim Jarmusch for ``Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai;'' 
and Atom Egoyan, the Canadian director of ``Felicia's Journey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the four American films in the competition were honored.  
Also shut out was a crowd favorite, ``Kikujiro,'' a lighthearted 
road movie by Japanese director Takeshi Kitano. 
</P>
<P>
	In a further surprise, the ceremony was marred by a rambling,  
disoriented speech by French actress Sophie Marceau, who presented 
the Golden Palm. She went on so long and incomprehensibly that the 
audience called for her to stop, and she was interrupted by the 
hostess of the ceremony, British actress Kristin Scott Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	In other awards, the jury prize went to ``The Letter,'' by  
veteran director Manoel de Oliveira of Portugal. And in a nod to a 
film that was widely panned, best screenplay went to ``Moloch,'' a 
German-Russian production about Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's jury was headed by the Canadian director of  
``Crash,'' David Cronenberg, and included Jeff Goldblum and Holly 
Hunter; directors Andre Techine, George Miller, Maurizio Nichetti 
and Doris Dorrie; playwright Yasmina Reza; classical singer Barbara 
Hendricks and French actress Dominque Blanc. 
</P>
<P>
	Several notable films also premiered outside the main  
competition. One of them was Spike Lee's ``Summer of Sam,'' a 
powerful look at the summer of 1977 when New York was terrorized by 
the serial killer David Berkowitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Also notable was Kevin Smith's ``Dogma,'' a controversial  
religious satire featuring Ben Affleck and Matt Damon as two very 
un-angelic angels trying to make it back to heaven.

<HEADLINE> Murphy: Vote Fraud Charge Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARMINGTON, Pa. (AP) -- A former congressman arraigned Monday on  
charges of voter fraud denied the allegations and suggested his 
accusers were using the case for political gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Former U.S. Rep. Austin J. Murphy, 71, was arraigned on charges  
of forgery, conspiracy, tampering with public records and 
falsifying public records. 
</P>
<P>
	The case centers on the Bouras Personal Care Home, a nursing  
home where 39 ballots from 1997 were found to be invalid because of 
forgeries. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy and two others were accused of writing in the name of  
Murphy's wife, Eileen, on the ballots of elderly people for a post 
on the Wharton Township election board. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy said he helped some nursing home residents complete  
paperwork for absentee ballots, but did nothing illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy claimed the case was the result of the political  
ambitions of the prosecutor, Fayette County District Attorney Peter 
Hook, who last week lost a bid for the Republican nomination to be 
a county commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	Hook did not return a telephone message left at his office.  
</P>
<P>
	Murphy retired from the Congress in 1994 after 18 years in  
office, where he was reprimanded for hiring a no-show staffer and 
permitting someone else to cast votes for him.

<HEADLINE> Elbow Sidelined Indians' Reed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland Indians reliever Steve Reed, second  
on the team with 20 appearances this season, was hospitalized 
Monday with an infected bursar sac in his left elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed was being held overnight at Cleveland's Lutheran Hospital  
where his elbow was being treated with antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander is 1-0 with a 1.93 ERA this year. Last season,  
Reed, acquired in a July trade from San Francisco, was limited to 
just six appearances in September after a blood clot in his right 
wrist caused numbness in the fingers of his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, signed in April to a two-year contract extension, is the  
latest Indians reliever to be sidelined. Paul Shuey and Ricky 
Rincon recently rejoined the team after spending time on the 15-day 
disabled list.

<HEADLINE> Panel Extends Jockey's Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The state Racing Commission voted  
unanimously Monday to uphold and extend the suspension of jockey 
Billy Patin, accused of using an electrical device to spur his 
horse to victory in the Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing stewards at Oaklawn Park had suspended Patin for a year --  
the harshest penalty they were authorized to impose. But they 
recommended that the commission extend the suspension until May 5, 
2004, for a total of five years, and the commission voted 5-0 to 
follow that recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also upheld the stewards' decision to disqualify  
Valhol and redistribute the $300,000 winner's share of the purse in 
the April 10 race. 
</P>
<P>
	Patin had appealed his suspension and $2,500 fine to the  
commission, while Valhol owner James Jackson appealed the 
disqualification of his horse. He said he would appeal the 
commission's ruling to circuit court. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony before the commission Monday was largely a rerun of  
testimony to the stewards inquiry earlier this month. Racing 
investigator Paul Berube testified that static on an audiotape made 
from a microphone that Patin wore during the Derby matched what was 
produced in laboratory testing of an electrical device found on the 
Oaklawn Park track after the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Berube, president of the Thoroughbred Racing Protective Bureau,  
testified for more than two hours. He said he was sure the device 
found on the track after the race was carried illegally by Patin 
when he rode Valhol to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Patin ``possessed a device during the Arkansas Derby, he  
deposited it on the race track after the race,'' Oaklawn attorney 
Jim Simpson said. ``The evidence is consistent but not conclusive 
that he used it. (But) if he possessed it, that's a violation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson defended his horse's showing in the Derby.  
</P>
<P>
	``They can't see anything with that horse (to show) he ran  
anything other than the way he usually runs,'' Jackson said. ``The 
horse ran a good race, the horse won the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berube, head of the investigative branch of the thoroughbred  
racing industry, testified that the microphone strapped inside 
Patin's jersey picked up static shortly before and after the 
three-eighths mile marker, as Valhol took the lead. That static, 
picked up on tape, matched what was obtained from lab tests on the 
electrical device that was found on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to operate the device at Monday's hearing eventually  
produced a loud hum, after several attempts produced no sound. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also watched a videotape showing a dark object  
falling from Patin's hand during Valhol's victory gallop after 
crossing the finish line. Berube said he was personally convinced 
that the device found on the track was what was seen on videotape 
falling from Patin's hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination by Patin's lawyer, J. Minos Simon of  
Lafayette, La., Berube said fingerprint tests on the device were 
inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Grilled by lawyers for Patin and Jackson, Oaklawn general  
manager Eric Jackson said he had handled the device found on the 
track, and said others may also have done so, just after the race 
and before it was shipped to Berube's agency to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were serious about connecting this with Mr. Patin, you  
would certainly have exercised some caution to preserve that 
valuable piece of evidence,'' lawyer Sam Laser chided. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Jackson said he had no indication where the device came  
from until two days later when he said a videotape of the race. But 
he admitted to a misstep. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have been more careful, but I wasn't,'' the racetrack  
manager said.

<HEADLINE> Oil Cos. Lack National Y2K Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The oil and gas industry, with its dependence  
on computers, has too many question marks about its plans to deal 
with Year 2000 computer problems, a congressional report concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of  
Congress, said while individual companies are confronting possible 
problems, no national-level approach has emerged to deal with 
shortages or disruptions in the nation's oil and gas supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The oil and gas industry is highly automated, and the task to  
remediate all critical systems is enormous,'' said Sen. Robert 
Bennett, R-Utah, who requested the report and who chairs a special 
Senate panel on the Y2K problem with vice chairman Sen. Christopher 
Dodd, D-Conn. ``It appears they started too late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Citing an industry survey taken in February, the GAO said more  
than a quarter of the industry does not expect to be Y2K ready 
until the second half of 1999, ``leaving little time for resolving 
unexpected problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Petroleum Institute spokesman Juan Palomo said the  
industry has taken extensive steps to fix computers and prepare for 
contingencies. He said it has long experience in dealing with 
natural disasters and other crises and has backups for every 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very confident that we will do everything that needs to  
be done to continue the flow of oil to American consumers,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also noted that more than half of U.S. oil is  
imported, which leaves the country vulnerable to production and 
transportation problems in other countries that have done less to 
prepare for the possibility that some computers will read 2000 as 
1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said if the flow of foreign oil imports is  
interrupted, oil can be supplied by the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve, which now holds nearly 600 million barrels of oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The reserve can supply about 3.9 million barrels a day for 90  
days, three-eighths of daily imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Monday, the National Federation of Independent Business  
and Wells Fargo released results of a survey that found 59 percent 
of small businesses that might encounter Y2K problems have acted to 
prevent disruption. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of 500 small business owners, conducted in April by  
the Gallup Organization, also found that 54 percent of those 
responding had verified their suppliers and financial institutions 
are preparing for Y2K. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was the third taken in the past year by the NFIB,  
which represents small businesses. In April 1998, only 23 percent 
of at-risk small firms had taken action. Last October the figure 
was up to 40 percent. The margin of error for the survey was plus 
or minus 3.5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen a large jump in awareness of the problem over the  
last six months,'' said William Dennis, who authored the study for 
the NFIB Education Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Move Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices retreated early  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn, soybeans and spring wheat were pressured by expectations  
for favorable planting weather this week across most of the 
Midwest. Market participants were expecting the U.S. Agriculture 
Department's weekly update, to be released at the end of the day, 
to show planting remains ahead of the normal five-year pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Most investors also were viewing heavy rainfall over the weekend  
as beneficial to the newly planted crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures faced additional pressure ahead of active  
harvesting in the winter wheat states. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 2 cents to $2.50 1/4 a bushel; July  
corn fell 3 1/2 cents to $2.15 a bushel; July oats fell 2 1/4 cents to 
$1.18 a bushel; July soybeans fell 5 3/4 cents to $4.56 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell .12 cent to 63.40 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .05 cent to 74.97 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell .75 cent to 56.15 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell .30 
cent to 53.30 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Court Orders Retiree Miner Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to free the  
former operator of two Kentucky coal mines from having to finance 
health benefits for its retired employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, turned away Robert Coal Co.'s  
argument that a 1992 federal law should not force it to pay for the 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Coal operated two mines in Pike County, Ky., between 1974  
and 1984. During that time, it signed several contracts with the 
United Mine Workers of America that promised health care benefits 
to its employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The mines were sold in 1984, and Robert Coal no longer operated  
them. But the coal miners' union sued the company, saying it still 
was obligated to provide health benefits to retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1988 settlement, Robert Coal agreed to pay retirees'  
health benefits through January 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Congress created the United Mine Workers Benefit Plan  
to provide lifetime health care benefits. The law requires the 
company that most recently employed a worker to pay for the 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	After Robert Coal refused to pay premiums, the benefit plan's  
trustees sued in federal court in the District of Columbia. The 
company, now a subsidiary of Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. in Cleveland, 
Ohio, estimated the premiums would cost it $8.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge ruled against Robert Coal, saying the 1988 settlement  
did not free it of any future obligation to pay for retirees' 
benefits. A federal appeals court agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	While the appeal was pending, the Supreme Court ruled last year  
in an unrelated case that a Massachusetts-based company that left 
the coal business in 1965 could not be forced to pay for its 
retirees' lifetime health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Robert Coal's lawyers said last  
year's Supreme Court ruling should control its dispute. Forcing the 
company to pay for health benefits would unfairly nullify the 1988 
settlement and would amount to an unconstitutional taking of its 
property without payment, Robert Coal's lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers said the Kentucky case differed from  
the Massachusetts case because Robert Coal had promised its 
employees health care benefits for life. The Massachusetts company 
had not. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Robert Coal Co. vs. Holland, 98-1311.

<HEADLINE> Boat Qualifies on Indy Front Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- It's hard to tell which was more difficult  
for Billy Boat, crashing for the third time in a week or having to 
explain his misfortune to his boss, A.J. Foyt. 
</P>
<P>
	``A.J. chased me around the shop just a little bit. ... I still  
outran him, though,'' Boat said, joking. 
</P>
<P>
	His third crash was on Saturday as he took a warmup lap before  
Indianapolis 500 qualifications. Foyt, watching from trackside, 
slammed a green signal flag to the ground in disgust, then ran back 
to the garage to get his crew started repairing Boat's 
Dallara-Aurora. 
</P>
<P>
	Four-and-a-half hours later, with the rebuilt car, Boat  
completed four laps at an average 223.469 mph, putting him on the 
outside of the front row, next to Arie Luyendyk and Greg Ray for 
the May 30 race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Billy works hard and listens to me,'' said Foyt, a four-time  
Indy winner, who is known for his quick temper. ``Billy is a great 
race driver. It's been a tough week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are one big family. That's what makes a winning  
combination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boat won one race last year and set an Indy Racing League record  
with six poles, including the Indy 500. Teammate Kenny Brack had 
three victories and won the IRL season championship. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Boat first crashed on May 16, the second day of  
practice, causing heavy damage to the left side and rear of his 
car. The next day, he crashed again, this time damaging the right 
side. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, morning rain, a drop in temperature and high  
humidity produced slippery track conditions. Boat lost traction for 
just an instant, but that was enough to send his car spinning first 
to the left, then to the right and into the Turn 2-wall with heavy 
damage to the right side. 
</P>
<P>
	He was not injured, but had to go to the infield hospital for a  
mandatory checkup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the doctor, `I hope I'm not back in a few minutes after  
I talk to A.J.,' but he was great,'' Boat said Sunday. ``It's times 
like that when things are down when you look at a guy like that to 
pick you up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boat called Saturday's crash ``a stupid incident.''  
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to look at yourself in the mirror and say, `What's  
going on?' They just said, `Don't worry about it.' I knew we had 
the race car, and I knew we had the setup, but it's been a long 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can appreciate qualifying for this race  
until you go through something like this. There's nothing given to 
anybody here, and my boss told me that better than anybody. ... 
Never once did he say anything negative to me. He's been there. I'm 
very fortunate he believes in me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boat qualified on the pole last year at 223.503, and led the  
first 12 laps. He finished 23rd after a bad drive line knocked him 
out after 111 laps.

	Mrs. Clinton Commits to Move to NY  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton says she will definitely  
make her home in New York after leaving the White House, whether or 
not she runs for the Senate. The first lady made the commitment 
during a CBS-TV ``60 Minutes II'' interview after being asked which 
New York baseball team she would root for. ``The politic answer,

	Report: China Has U.S. 'Front' Cos.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China secretly controls several thousand  
American ``front companies'' to obtain U.S. technology for military 
purposes, a congressional report says. It's part of a 700-page 
document to be issued tomorrow by a special House committee 
investigating espionage and U.S. technology losses to China, 
officials familiar with the report said today. The report describes 
a ``blurring of commerce and intelligence operations'' by China 
that poses an unprecedented challenge to U.S. efforts to keep its 
military-related secrets, said congressional sources. Problems with 
lax security at U.S. weapons labs are also described in the report.

	Reno Vows To Keep Her Job

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno made clear today  
that she isn't resigning over the handling of allegations of 
Chinese nuclear espionage. ``I'm right here, going strong,'' she 
said. Her future was questioned by Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., 
who has been a vocal defender of President Clinton. Reno's ouster 
had been sought during the past two years by some Republicans in 
Congress angered by her refusal to turn her campaign finance 
investigation over to an independent counsel.

	Schools May Be Liable in Harassment  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 today that schools  
can be sued when officials fail to stop students from sexually 
harassing each other. Schools -- from elementary to college -- that 
accept federal money can be forced to pay victims of such 
harassment. The court also decided that police who let the news 
media accompany them into people's homes to observe arrests or 
searches can be sued for violating the Constitution's Fourth 
Amendment protection against unreasonable searches. It also turned 
down an appeal by a Maine dentist who was sued for refusing to 
treat a woman in his office because she has the virus that causes 
AIDS.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A U.N. team today said it found the  
humanitarian situation worse than expected in Kosovo. Visits to 
more than seven Kosovo towns over three days showed conditions in 
the province to be ``a lot worse than we feared,'' said Sergio de 
Mello, head of the U.N. fact-finding mission. ``Everything 
indicates that there is an attempt to displace, ethnically cleanse 
Kosovo,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higher, Japan Stocks Advance / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen today  
despite profit-taking in reaction to last week's surge to 
seven-month highs. Japanese stocks advanced moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 124.04 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.28  
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its level of 124.01 
yen late Friday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 97.51 points,  
or 0.60 percent, closing the day's trading at 16,390.49 points. On 
Friday, the average closed up 92.99 points, or 0.57 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, strong buying from Japanese trust banks  
and U.S. funds pushed the dollar to an intraday high of 124.39 yen 
early in the session, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar shed some of its early gains after U.S. funds and  
Japanese banks later sold dollars to lock in profits, pushing the 
currency as low as 123.74 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign exchange market mostly shrugged off a morning  
announcement that Japan's trade surplus fell 12.6 percent in April 
to $8.62 billion from the same month of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure was almost in line with consensus estimates of  
economists, who had forecast on average that the surplus would fall 
by 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.22 yen, up from  
131.17 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Optimistic forecasts by companies for the current fiscal year  
through March 200 led to buying of selected issues on the Tokyo 
stock market, although overall profit results for the last fiscal 
year ended March have been poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies think things will be better this year, but  
historically what companies think is not a very reliable estimate 
of what will happen,'' said Richard Jerram, chief economist at ING 
Baring Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerram said there will likely be an improvement in the second  
quarter of this year from the previous quarter, although overall 
corporate profits could be lower this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The market opened moderately weaker on futures-led profit-taking  
and hedge selling, but stocks soon rebounded on the view that the 
downside remains solid. After modest fluctuations, the Nikkei 
average moved into positive territory toward the closing bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 410  
million shares, down from Friday's turnover of 565 million shares. 
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 606 to 591, with 114 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was up 7.84 points, or 0.60 percent, to 
1,317.51. The TOPIX closed up 7.80 points, or 0.60 percent, on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.350 percent from Friday's finish of 1.325 percent, 
driving its price down to 101.32 yen from 101.55 yen.

<HEADLINE> State Coffers Up As Revenues Rise / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Revenues have been pouring into state treasuries  
during the 1990s at a pace never seen before, creating surpluses 
that last year totaled $36 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a significant sum of money, as most people would agree,  
amounting to more than $300 for every family in America. And 
there's hardly a family that wouldn't know what to do with that. 
</P>
<P>
	Alas, they aren't being given the opportunity. The state  
governments are for the most part keeping it, not just to build 
reserves but to finance new and expanded programs. 
</P>
<P>
	This is just what taxpayers might have done with the money, of  
course, but it is (was)after all their money. But, say officials in 
most states, finders keepers -- we'll spend it for you. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation is a rare one, a consequence of various factors  
that have lessened state costs while raising revenues. It isn't 
just good times that have raised revenues; tax increases have too. 
</P>
<P>
	With all that money to spend, states have been faced with a  
tough decision: return funds to the taxpayers or keep the money and 
create new ways to spend. Generally they opt for the latter. 
</P>
<P>
	One study maintains that if states had limited spending and tax  
increases to the inflation rate and population growth during the 
period 1992-1998, the tax burden would be $75.2 billion lower 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Stansel and Stephen Moore of the Cato Foundation, authors  
of the study, point out that had the states been so restrained, 
each American today would have $278 in extra pocket money. 
</P>
<P>
	That's averaged out; in some states, what they call the excess  
tax burden averages much higher -- $787 per person in Michigan, $661 
in New Mexico, $573 in Minnesota, $535 in Connecticut and $520 in 
Wisconsin. That's for the period 1992-1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past four years, they argue, only one of every three  
dollars of unexpected revenue surpluses has been returned to 
taxpayers. True, some was used for reserves, but most was spent. 
</P>
<P>
	Stansel and Moore state that ``in an era of almost no inflation,  
state budgets grew by 4.5 percent in 1996, 5 percent in 1997 and 
nearly 6 percent in 1996.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the spending was in new budget areas, because the cost  
of running states seems to have actually declined. Interest rates 
are lower; welfare reform has reduced caseloads; health care cost 
increases have slowed and unemployment has declined. 
</P>
<P>
	But, says the report from Cato, a libertarian think tank that  
doesn't favor governmental growth, ``state governments consume a 
larger share of gross domestic product today than ever before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Various morals and lessons can and will be drawn from the trend.  
</P>
<P>
	Some will see a benign government spending to resolve problems  
that should have been addressed years ago. At the other extreme, 
some taxpayers believe they can spend the money more wisely. 
</P>
<P>
	But all might agree, for whatever they want to make of it, that  
while the focus was on budget cuts in Washington, the states snuck 
one by on taxpayers.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Revises Cadbury Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola Co. is moving to speed up its deal to  
acquire Cadbury Schweppes' soft drink brands overseas by excluding 
most of the European Union membership. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said the deal still will cover more than 100  
countries and is valued at $1.1 billion. When announced in 
December, it covered 126 countries and was worth $1.85 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal had drawn criticism from the European Union, which  
raised antitrust questions. As revised, only three EU members -- 
Britain, Ireland, and Greece -- remain involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have modified the agreement to meet the specific concerns  
expressed, both by the EC and individual nations,'' Coke chairman 
M. Douglas Ivester said Monday. ``And we have decided to move 
quickly to make those modifications while maintaining a viable 
proposition for Cadbury Schweppes and us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The original agreement said Coke would buy Cadbury's soft  
drinks, such as Schweppes, Dr Pepper, Canada Dry and Crush brands, 
in Cadbury Schweppes markets excluding the United States, France 
and South Africa. The revised deal now excludes 12 European Union 
nations, including France, and other countries where the 
transaction was being slowed by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	It still must clear regulatory hurdles in Britain, Australia,  
Mexico and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Nations dropped from the deal are Andorra, Austria, Belgium,  
Denmark, Finland, Germany, Gibraltar, Iceland, Italy, 
Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, The Netherlands, Norway, 
Portugal, San Marino, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Brokerage Refco Settles Trade Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Refco Inc., one of the nation's largest futures  
brokerage firms, will pay $8 million to settle claims that it gave 
a California money manager virtual independence in trading that 
resulted in $100 million in investor losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago-based firm, without admitting wrongdoing, agreed to  
pay a $6 million cash penalty to the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission and $1 million for an industry study of how firms keep 
track of orders, according to the settlement announced Monday. 
Separately, Refco agreed to pay $1 million to the Chicago Board of 
Trade in a fine related to the same case. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly Hills, Calif., financial adviser Jay Goldinger has been  
accused of distributing false reports to investors after betting 
incorrectly on whether interest rates would rise or fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout 1995, Goldinger was allowed to place thousands of  
orders for Treasury bond futures and options contracts without 
identifying whom those orders were for, an investigation found. 
After the orders were executed, the broker assigned the trades to 
whatever customer accounts he chose, allowing him to decide winners 
and losers, according to the CFTC complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	The CFTC had accused Refco of being too lax at keeping an eye on  
Goldinger's activities as a registered independent introducing 
broker. 
</P>
<P>
	``The order finds that Refco had indications of the improper  
handling of trades, which it failed to investigate properly,'' the 
CFTC said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Refco, which has had repeated run-ins with regulators over  
failing to properly supervise employees, said it views the 
settlement ``as an opportunity to resolve long-standing issues with 
regulatory authorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Murphy, hired in April as the company's new president, said  
a reshuffling of managers within the firm will strengthen oversight 
``so that serious incidents such as this do not happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The firm still faces private lawsuits stemming from the case.  
Those lawsuits contend Refco earned between $45 million and $90 
million in commissions on the trades. 
</P>
<P>
	While large companies posted most of the losses, oversight of  
futures and options trading has become an increasingly thorny issue 
for regulators over the past few years as Internet trading firms 
have applied to do business and more average Americans have turned 
to the high-risk business for investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has led to ongoing investigations at the Securities and  
Exchange Commission, the Los Angeles U.S. attorney's office and the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation. Some of those investigations are 
of companies that suffered trading losses and are accused of 
failing to disclose them in a timely fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	Constantine Mitsopoulos, who ran Refco's trading desk at the  
time of the violations, agreed in January to pay $1 million in a 
settlement with the Chicago Board of Trade that banned him from the 
exchange for 10 years.

<HEADLINE> 81-Year-Old Climbs Calif. Mountain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- Overcoming aching joints  
and chilly weather, Gerry Bloch became the oldest climber to scale 
the steep face of Yosemite National Park's famed El Capitan -- for 
the second time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest challenge was to do what others have called the  
impossible -- at least for my age -- but I knew I could do it,'' said 
Bloch, 81. ``This is by far the most difficult, the most 
satisfying, and the most gratifying climb I have ever made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bathed in bright sunshine that reflected off surrounding  
snowcapped mountains, Bloch reached the summit about 5 p.m. Sunday, 
breaking his own record as the oldest person to make the climb. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greetings, all,'' he said with a tired smile to his grandson  
and a half dozen reporters who had hiked for eight hours along a 
trail and were waiting for him at the summit of the granite 
monolith. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloch, a retired chemical engineer from Woodbury, N.J., set out  
on his quest May 12 with two other men. The climb was supposed to 
take only a week, but the group was slowed by cold weather and the 
weight of the food and water they carried. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloch also ran out of medication for his arthritis and had to  
settle for ibuprofen. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I really knew what I was getting into, I wouldn't have done  
it,'' Bloch joked. ``There were days when we thought we wouldn't 
make it but we just kept striving. This is an obstacle course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He last scaled El Capitan, one of the most popular challenges  
for serious rock climbers, in 1986, when he was age 68. Back then, 
Bloch took a relatively easy route, up The Nose. This time, 
protected by a bright orange helmet and knee pads, he scaled the 
more difficult Aquarian Wall, rising 2,500 feet to the summit. 
</P>
<P>
	He never doubted that he'd break his own record.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had confidence in the people, equipment and the technique,''  
Bloch said. ``Besides, I've been climbing since I was 16.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bloch was accompanied to the rocky summit by guide Mike Corbett  
and NBC cameraman Craig White. The summit is dotted with windswept 
pine trees with a view of Yosemite Valley waterfalls below. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gerry climbed up every inch of it,'' White said. ``We didn't  
pull him up at all or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bloch and his team planned to rappel down the 7,569-foot  
mountain today, which they expected to take four to five hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloch quit skydiving at age 78 after doctors refused to treat  
him unless he promised he'd stop, said grandson Sam Bloch, 20, who 
shook his hand at the summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the elder Bloch plans to relax. ``I'm retiring,'' he said.  
``This was a fabulous experience and this was an ultimate 
experience.''

<HEADLINE> Ancient Cheetah, Camel Bones Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELKO, Nev. (AP) -- Cheetah, camel and llama bones sealed in a  
Nevada cave for tens of thousands of years are giving scientists a 
glimpse at the ecosystem of the West before the last Ice Age. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusually well preserved cache from about 40,000 to 50,000  
years ago includes bones from a wide variety of creatures now 
extinct -- from the giant short-faced bear to huge deer and bison. 
</P>
<P>
	``This cave is kind of a Noah's Ark collection of species,''  
said Tom Stafford, a Boulder, Colo.-based specialist who has been 
testing the bones. 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions at the back of the cave are like those of a  
modern refrigerator. Perhaps most intriguing to the scientists are 
the twigs, leaves, seeds and animal hair from which they believe 
they'll be able to extract DNA to compare the genetic makeup of 
past and present species. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could see how much evolution there has been,'' said Bryan  
Hockett, the Bureau of Land Management archaeologist who is leading 
a new excavation at the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Hockett, 37, and fellow archaeologist Eric Dillingham, 37, have  
been dragging bones out of the cave for the past two summers and 
next month plan the largest expedition yet into the 700-foot 
cavern. 
</P>
<P>
	The bones are in the back of a cave where miners left their mark  
in the 1860s. Hockett suspects the cave some 300 miles east of Reno 
was a den for large carnivores that dragged prey back to feed their 
young. 
</P>
<P>
	The find is evidence of the wildly diverse ecosystem in the  
western United States before the last big Ice Age, 18,000 years 
ago. It was a vast grassland where predators stalked grazing 
animals well before man is believed to have arrived on the scene 
10,000 to 12,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the bones are from animals which originate from the end  
of the Pleistocene Age. There are horses, mountain sheep, pronghorn 
antelope, wolves, weasels, badgers, coyotes, lizards, bats and 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
	The giant short-faced bear had a short snout and longer legs  
than a typical bear. It was much larger than bears today and a fast 
runner. 
</P>
<P>
	The cheetah remains are only the second discovered in Nevada.  
Fewer than 10 have been recorded in North America and the remains 
may shed light on a question that has bothered scientists for 
decades: Why are pronghorn antelope so fast? 
</P>
<P>
	``There was always speculation that there must have been a  
faster-running predator during the Pleistocene than we know of 
today because the American pronghorn can run so much faster than 
anything living here now that might have been a predator,'' said 
Robert Emry, a paleo-biologist at the Smithsonian's Museum of 
Natural History in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Opera Star Beverly Sills Turns 70 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Beverly Sills was, well, bubbling.  
</P>
<P>
	Just shy of her 70th birthday on May 25, her standout recording  
of Douglas Moore's ``The Ballad of Baby Doe'' was about to be 
released on compact disc for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a funny way it's like that career happened to somebody  
else,'' Miss Sills said during an interview last month. ``I feel 
like an observer at this point. In my family, my singing career is 
never discussed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Sills, known as Bubbles Silverman when she had her radio  
debut on ``Uncle Bob's Rainbow House'' as a child, made her 
professional operatic debut in Philadelphia in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	During more than three decades on stage, she sang dozens of  
coloratura roles, specializing in heroines such as Massanet's 
``Manon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She doesn't sing at all these days.  
</P>
<P>
	``Since I've retired, I sang `Happy Birthday' to Isaac Stern,''  
Miss Sills said lightly -- she last performed in 1980. ``The last 
time I sang I was 50. What could I sound like that would give me 
pleasure?'' 
</P>
<P>
	She doesn't even listen to her old recordings. Even in her  
singing days she avoided her records because she'd concentrate on 
mistakes rather than successes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ashamed to tell you, I don't listen to them. I go to the  
opera. I have my box -- it was once reported in New York Magazine 
that I left in the middle, so I always stay to the end. I thought I 
had solved that problem by getting a box instead of sitting in the 
orchestra.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Sills has enough to fill her schedule without singing.  
She's the chairwoman of Lincoln Center, a director of the 
Metropolitan Opera and a director of Time Warner Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	She appears as a host before performances on Public  
Broadcasting, a role that has been lampooned by Ira Siff's La Gran 
Scena, an opera company of drag divas. Miss Sills even attended a 
Grand Scena performance, watching a man imitate her always 
ebullient personality. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hysterically funny,'' she said. ``He's got me down pat,  
that guy. He had me down so perfectly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Sills has become something of an icon -- THE American opera  
singer. No matter how good they are, current stars like Renee 
Fleming, Deborah Voigt and Ruth Ann Swenson are known only by a 
small percentage of the general public. Bubbles, however, has name 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrence McNally even poked fun at her in his 1989 play, ``The  
Lisbon Traviata,'' in which she is put down by fans of Maria 
Callas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stephen: Have you heard Sills' last `Thais?' ''  
</P>
<P>
	``Mendy: Unfortunately, I heard her first Thais.' ''  
</P>
<P>
	Miss Sills can be just as biting in her reviews. Even though  
she's a board member, she loathed the Met's new ``La Traviata'' 
that Franco Zeffirelli staged last fall. The singers, she said, 
were lost in all the grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
	``Franco, Franco, how could you?'' she told a group of  
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	And she didn't think much of the negative reviews given to  
Carlisle Floyd's ``Susannah'' at the Met this spring. Some said the 
3,800-seat house was too large for the work. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shouldn't talk out of both sides of their mouth,'' she  
said of critics. ``They say, 'Why don't you do more contemporary 
work?' and when they do more contemporary work, they treat it with 
a condescending view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle Maria Silverman -- her given name -- knew she wanted to be a  
singer at an early age. She was voted ``Most Beautiful Baby of 
1932'' after singing ``The Wedding of Jack and Jill'' at a 
competition in Brooklyn, N.Y., and adored the singer Lily Pons -- 
memorizing arias from the record collection of her mother, Shirley. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father, Morris, was an insurance salesman from Romania and  
her mother was from Ukraine, and they encouraged her musical 
studies at the Professional Children's School as she went through 
New York City public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1945, she had caught the attention of impresario J.J.  
Schubert, who used her in light opera and Broadway-type musicals. 
She made her debut in 1947 in Philadelphia in a bit role in 
``Carmen,'' and slowly made her way up to bigger companies. Her 
breakthrough came in 1966 at the New York City Opera, where her 
performance of Cleopatra in Handel's ``Giulio Cesare,'' made her a 
star. In Italy, the critics adored her, calling her ``La Fenomina'' 
after a first night at La Scala. 
</P>
<P>
	She didn't appear at the Metropolitan Opera until 1975, shortly  
before her retirement from singing -- which made it surprising when 
the Met asked her to sit on its board. 
</P>
<P>
	As an administrator who spent 10 years as general director of  
the New York City Opera, she understands the conflict between the 
different audiences. While some want rare operas, many prefer the 
warhorses. The choice is a painful one for her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three performances of `Boheme' and have a 90 percent house? Or  
do three performances of `Susannah' or `Doe' and have a 72, 75 
percent house?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Doe,'' while not in the standard repertoire, is a work that  
has attracted fervid followers -- known as ``Doeites.'' The 
re-released recording also includes Walter Cassel as Horace Tabor 
and Frances Bible as Tabor's wife, Augusta, with Emerson Buckley 
conducting the New York City Opera Orchestra and Chorus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will find its niche in history, if it hasn't  
already happened,'' Miss Sills said. ``It's too beautiful to go 
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To get the opera recorded, Miss Sills received a fee of just  
$502, she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't do any retakes,'' she said. ``It was, `Just keep  
singing, honey.' ''

<HEADLINE> Meth Dealers Eyed in Yosemite Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MODESTO, Calif. (AP) -- FBI agents investigating the slayings of  
three Yosemite National Park sightseers have zeroed in on a 
loose-knit group of methamphetamine users and are confident that 
some of those responsible are already behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Sund, a member of a wealthy real estate family in Eureka,  
vanished Feb. 15 along with her 15-year-old daughter Juli and their 
Argentine friend Silvina Pelosso during a trip through the Sierra 
foothills. 
</P>
<P>
	They were found dead weeks later and hours away from where they  
were last seen. The burned bodies of Mrs. Sund, 42, and Ms. 
Pelosso, 16, were found in the trunk of their charred rental car. 
Juli's body was discovered more than 30 miles away on a hill. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged in the slayings.  
</P>
<P>
	Investigators must resolve many questions: How did the  
sightseers encounter their assailants? How were they killed? And 
why? Was it for money, sex, thrills, something else? 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement sources and grand jury witnesses said the probe  
is centered on a group of ``cranksters'' -- methamphetamine is known 
as ``crank'' -- including Eugene ``Rufus'' Dykes and Michael 
``Mick'' Larwick, half-brothers with a long history of weapons, 
drug and sex offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Ledbetter, Dykes' girlfriend, said she recovered one of  
his knives at the request of the FBI and has testified before the 
federal grand jury investigating the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	The law enforcement sources, speaking to The Associated Press on  
condition of anonymity, said investigators are still trying to 
identify everyone who may have been involved in the slayings and 
figure out what their roles were. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI agent in charge, James Maddock, would not confirm the  
accounts of Ms. Ledbetter or other people interviewed by the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said last week that his task force has collected hundreds  
of pieces of potential physical evidence and is making substantial 
progress in solving the mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents have been forced to return time and again for  
corroboration from witnesses whose memories may be clouded by 
drug-induced paranoia or hallucinations. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're dealing with individuals in the crank trade or  
circles, one of the byproducts generally is these people are not as 
responsible or aware of details. We're not dealing with people who 
have regular jobs and regular lives,'' Maddock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Methamphetamine is a potent illegal drug that often causes  
delusions, paranoia and aggressive behavior. It a fast-growing drug 
problem in much of the Far West and Southwest. The drug is 
particularly popular with outlaw biker gangs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-month-old investigation gained momentum shortly after the  
women's bodies were found. Agents shifted their attention from the 
rustic lodge in El Portal where the women were last seen to the 
seedy neighborhoods and trailer parks where the meth trade thrives 
in Modesto. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the bodies were found, Dykes and Larwick had been  
arrested during separate standoffs in Modesto. Larwick, 42, 
allegedly shot and wounded an officer who had pulled him over for a 
false license plate. Dykes, 32, was taken into custody on an 
undisclosed parole violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Larwick has roots in Long Barn, the tiny community where the  
victims' car was set on fire. One of his hangouts, friends said, is 
a home less than 10 blocks from the Modesto street corner where 
part of Mrs. Sund's wallet was found. Agents questioned him for 16 
hours straight. He has professed his innocence and said he provided 
a blood sample to clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykes, an ex-con with a record of meth possession, unlawful sex  
and weapons convictions, also remains in custody. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe my son had anything to do with it,'' said his  
father, Burel Dykes. ``He may know something, though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement sources said that others must have been involved  
in the slayings as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting people to talk has not been easy. This is one reason  
investigators convened the grand jury April 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to take our clique down,'' said Angelia Dale,  
24, a friend of Dykes and Larwick who has been arrested for meth 
possession and was subpoenaed to testify.

<HEADLINE>  Paralyzed Gymnast Returns to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Smiling teammates bearing bouquets of flowers  
greeted paralyzed gymnast Sang Lan when she returned to China on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy to finally be home after ten months so far  
away. I thank everybody for all their help and attention,'' the 
17-year-old Sang said from a wheelchair at an airport news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The diminutive athlete appeared emotional but poised while  
speaking briefly with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sang said she would continue to ``study hard.''  
</P>
<P>
	In New York, where she lived at the apartment of a guardian  
couple, Sang studied English and computers, and recently took up 
table tennis as a form of therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Gina Liu, with whom Sang stayed in New York, said the teen-ager  
had mastered the basics of cooking and caring for herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's approached her problems like a super woman,'' said Zhang  
Faqiang, vice director of China's deputy head of the State Sports 
General Administration. ``She's the pride of all Chinese.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zhang said the administration will continue to oversee her  
rehabilitation and hopes to get her involved in sports activities 
for the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Sang, a member of the Chinese national gymnastics team, severely  
injured her neck doing warm-up exercises during the Goodwill Games 
at Uniondale, N.Y., in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Though paralyzed from the chest down, she has regained some  
strength in her shoulders, elbows and wrists and can raise her 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
	Sang will stay at a residence prepared for her in Beijing before  
deciding whether or not to return to her parents home in the 
southern port city of Ningbo, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Fine Line Between Harassing, Teasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Supreme Court ruling holding schools liable  
for students' harassment of one another could mean schools will 
face new difficulties in distinguishing illegal harassment from 
rambunctious teasing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next year, kids will be suspended for behavior nobody's ever  
been suspended for, and parents will ask why,'' said Bruce Hunter 
of the American Association of School Administrators. ``But I don't 
see any way of avoiding that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schools -- from elementary to colleges -- that accept federal  
money can be sued by victims of such harassment, the court said 
Monday in its 5-4 ruling. The decision stems from a fifth-grade 
girl's lawsuit against the Monroe County, Ga., school board, saying 
a classmate harassed her despite complaints to officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Some districts have sexual harassment policies that take a  
student's age, prior conduct, and intent into account, but the 
Supreme Court decision made it clear they need stronger policies to 
back up their actions, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	What officials don't see is schools any backing off the issue.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is rare to find a school or college that does not  
respond,'' said Norma Cantu, the Education Department's civil 
rights chief. ``We want common sense. Cases should not be 
exaggerated or ignored. The Supreme Court decision is urging common 
sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back in 1996, schools in North Carolina and New York City were  
accused of going too far when they suspended small boys -- a 
first-grader and a second-grader -- for kissing female classmates. 
Since then, schools have had their share of problems in trying to 
determine what common sense is when addressing peer harassment: 
</P>
<P>
	--Last year, officials in a Peterborough, N.H., high school were  
criticized for not immediately expelling a 17-year-old boy charged 
with sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl. The boy, who served a 
20-day suspension, was allowed back into school because the school 
board's investigation didn't support other disciplinary action 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
	--In 1997, prosecutors in Arlington, Va., abruptly dropped a sex  
charge against a 9-year-old fourth-grade boy who was accused of 
rubbing against a 9-year-old girl in a sexual manner in a school 
lunch line. The boy's family said he accidentally brushed against 
the girl. 
</P>
<P>
	--In 1996, a state court held an Antioch, Calif., school district  
liable for violating a state harassment law and gave $500,000 to 
the family of a sixth-grade girl who said a boy in her class 
repeatedly called her ``slut'' and other vulgarities and threatened 
her physically. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a double-edged sword,'' said Arizona State Board of  
Education spokeswoman Patricia Likens. ``You may see more lawsuits 
that are more justified, or you may see parents jumping to 
conclusions. But the onus is on the districts. They are going to 
have to tread lightly on this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Educating students about sexual harassment has changed in  
Georgia's Monroe County schools, where the court case started four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a program now that talks about the difference between  
a good touch and bad touch,'' said county schools superintendent 
Charles Dumas. ``We're starting even in primary school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Underwood, general counsel for the National Association of  
School Boards, believes the court's ruling could actually prevent 
schools from overreacting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The standard is pervasive sexual harassment. If the court had  
left it at all sexual harassment, schools would be in a position 
where they would have to respond to even the slightest blush,'' 
said Underwood. ``Hopefully, the standard is high enough that we 
won't get the frivolous suspensions for holding hands or for 
kissing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Children are children,'' she said. ``They are going to  
misbehave.''

<HEADLINE> Now Everybody Leaves LA Forum Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Maybe they are closing the old building just in time.  
</P>
<P>
	For most of the 30-plus years the Lakers called the Great  
Western Forum home, the only people who showed up late and left 
early were season ticket-holders. But now that maddening habit has 
spread from the seats to the Los Angeles bench. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second year running, the Lakers got a jump on summer tee  
times by losing four playoff games in a row. It might be easier to 
take if they were slow to surrender, or even a little bit less 
talented. There is no consolation, after all, being the NBA's best 
team on paper if you always fold. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, it was the Utah Jazz who learned exactly when and  
where to apply the pressure. This year, it was San Antonio. The 
Spurs closed out Game 4 with a late run, the same way they closed 
out Games 1, 2 and 3. The only difference is that they took the 
suspense out earlier, running off 13 straight points at the start 
of the fourth quarter instead of at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Lakers coach Kurt Rambis said afterward, ``I'm not  
going to question our players' efforts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He may be the only person in America who watched the game that  
doesn't. It may also be why the word ``interim'' is still part of 
Rambis' title. 
</P>
<P>
	``We simply got beat,'' he added, ``by a better team.''  
</P>
<P>
	It's funny Rambis should take so long to figure that out. He was  
an assistant when Del Harris got axed early in the season, when the 
Lakers were a collection of talented individuals who wouldn't share 
a basketball. Then the Dennis Rodman chemistry exam failed, Eddie 
Jones and Elden Campbell got exiled to Charlotte, and what remained 
was a different collection of talents -- still without an idea of 
how to share the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody looking in on the job Phil Jackson used to have --  
coaching Michael Jordan and the Bulls -- thought they could do it, 
but plenty of his peers knew better. Sometimes the hardest coaching 
job is simply making sure the sum isn't less than the individual 
parts. At the end of the San Antonio series, the Lakers owned the 
most dominant big man in the game, Shaquille O'Neal; one of the top 
half-dozen ``2'' guards in the game, Kobe Bryant; and probably the 
best pure shooter in the NBA, Glen Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	Given that, somebody asked Rambis after Game 3 how the Spurs  
kept winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're forcing us to do other things than what we have grown  
to be as a team,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Translation? San Antonio challenged the Lakers to play defense  
and make free throws. The first requires sacrifice. The second 
requires hours of tedious practice. The Lakers do neither well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad because we still never learned to play together, to  
play smart,'' O'Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been in the league for six years now. Five of those  
seasons ended with his team being swept in a playoff series. In the 
sixth, his team was beaten 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Watch Shaq at the end of a close game and this does not seem  
coincidental. He changes from the ``go-to'' guy to a gone one. 
O'Neal is either missing free throws or hiding in the offense, so 
he doesn't get fouled and have to miss them. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, preparing for life after Jordan, the NBA threw  
its considerable marketing muscle behind O'Neal. He isn't 
particularly entertaining, playing in the low post with a few 
moves, but he seemed big and effective enough to decide games. Then 
the Hack-a-Shaq defense made it very easy to neutralize him. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Tim Duncan joined the Spurs and quietly evolved  
into the league's best big man. He came in with an all-around game, 
but not surprising the one area he's improved most was at the 
free-throw line. As a senior, he barely topped 60 percent; during 
the playoffs, he's shooting 80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	What put him over the top, though, was teammate David Robinson.  
Robinson was one of the best big men in the league a while ago, but 
after playing alongside Duncan, he was smart enough to take on a 
new role. Sometimes, it meant taking the tough defensive 
assignments to free up Duncan. Other times, it meant giving up his 
own scoring and rebounding totals to win. 
</P>
<P>
	That lesson never took hold in Los Angeles this season, and  
might never with this bunch. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday the Spurs rolled out to a quick 13-6 lead and Rambis  
called time out. In quick succession, Bryant's sloppy pass was 
converted into a basket by Robinson and a short Duncan jumper was 
sandwiched between two more Laker turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	As the camera zeroed in on Rambis, he stared vacantly into the  
stands, probably hoping that owner Jerry Buss, like his Lakers, was 
among the late-arriving. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Down; Dow Off 174.61 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks tumbled Monday as investors shed Internet  
and bank shares, fearing that profits will be hampered in coming 
months by threats as diverse as higher interest rates and the Year 
2000 bug. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 174.61, or by 1.6 percent,  
to close at 10,654.67. At one point late in the session, the 
blue-chip average had lost almost 203 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators were also sharply lower. The Standard  
&AMP; Poor's 500 fell 23.64 to 1,306.65, and the Nasdaq composite fell 
66.48 to 2,453.66. 
</P>
<P>
	After several listless sessions on Wall Street, investors seized  
upon some industry analysts' warnings as a catalyst for a selloff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Volume is still very low, so when this market finally chose a  
direction, it was bound to be pretty extreme,'' said Arthur Hogan, 
chief market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank stocks were the first to fall. Citing concern about the  
Year 2000 computer bug, Credit Suisse First Boston on Monday issued 
a ``sell'' recommendation for Citigroup, Chase, J.P. Morgan and 
Bank One. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Suisse's banking analyst Michael Mayo said that while  
U.S. banks appear to be well prepared for potential glitches, many 
of their international counterparts may be prone to computer 
problems that could disrupt business and hurt earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Banks are the safest place to keep your money for the year  
2000; it's the bank stocks that we're worried about,'' Mayo said. 
Every stock on his list tumbled: Citigroup fell 2 11/16 to 65 1/8, 
Chase lost 3 1/16 to 75 7/8, J.P. Morgan fell 1 15/16 to 136 3/4 and Bank 
One dropped 1 5/16 to 58 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks led the Nasdaq Stock Market's decline as  
investors shed some high-priced stocks in search of bargains among 
less well-known issues. Excite fell 14 5/8 to 118 5/16, and retailer 
Amazon.com lost 11 1/8 to 117 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are finally getting bearish on the dot-com stocks,''  
Hogan said. The trend was underscored as Prudential Securities' 
Ralph Acampora, a research director well known for his bullish 
market outlook, issued an in-house report that suggested many 
Web-related stocks are at the top of their price range. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks have reached lofty levels despite that fact that  
few are profitable. Analysts now say that if higher interest rates 
start hampering corporate profits, investors may become less 
willing to pay up for companies that earn no profits at all. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent sessions, investors have moved gradually toward  
old-fashioned cyclical stocks -- those whose fortunes are closely 
tied to the performance of the economy. Analysts said those 
companies have been undervalued in recent months and now appear 
less vulnerable than high-flying Internet issues.

<P>
	Monday, the Dow's only gainers were cyclical companies like 3M,  
which edged up 7/8 to 89 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakness in technology shares carried over to big-name  
computer makers. IBM contributed most to the Dow's decline, 
tumbling 6 5/8 to 223 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking sector wasn't the only group hurt by a Wall Street  
analyst on Monday. Airline stocks fell after BT Alex Brown 
downgraded several carriers. Analyst Susan Donofrio said weak 
revenue trends and more expensive fuel should hamper results in the 
second half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL Corp., the parent of United Air Lines, fell 2 1/4 to 72 1/8, and  
AMR Corp., which owns American Airlines, slid 2 3/16 to 64 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Merger-and-acquisition activity was unusually quiet for a  
Monday. Shareholders of Avis Rent A Car sent its stock down 7 3/8 to 
28 after it agreed to buy Cendant's auto fleet leasing and fuel 
card businesses for about $1.8 billion. Cendant rose 3/8 to 19 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders are now looking head to government reports on initial  
jobless claims, gross domestic product, personal income and 
spending, all scheduled for release this week. Market watchers are 
anxious for at least one of those reports to offer some answers to 
the lingering questions about inflation.

	On the New York Stock Exchange Monday, declining issues  
outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin. NYSE consolidated volume 
totaled 910.81 million shares, compared to 836.41 million Friday.

<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 10.82 to 626.05, and the American

<HEADLINE> Sen. Wants Pressure on War Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate voted unanimously Monday to step up  
pressure for international prosecution of suspected Kosovo war 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	On a 90-to-0 vote, the Senate approved a nonbinding amendment by  
Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Mary Landrieu, D-La., that 
recommends ``vigorous investigation'' of war crimes by an 
international tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure authorizes $18 million to help an international  
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, expand its investigation into 
other Balkan war crimes to include activities in Kosovo, a Serbian 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, an amendment to a $288.8 billion Pentagon spending  
bill, also recommends that amnesty for those who might be indicted 
as war criminals not be made part of any diplomatic settlement to 
the conflict in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO should not accept any diplomatic solution that would bar  
indictment of war criminals,'' Specter said. To spare Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic ``or other high-ranking individuals 
should be rejected as part of any negotiated settlement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------

<HEADLINE> Student Arrested in Toy Gun Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A special education student who told police  
he pointed a cap gun at a girl in school to scare her was charged 
Monday with assault, terroristic threats and weapons possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Police moved all 630 students of William H. Brown Academy into  
the cafeteria for three hours to find the 13-year-old boy after 
learning he pointed a gun at the girl as she walked into class, 
police spokesman Matt Greimel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl didn't tell anyone about the incident for two hours and  
the boy had left school before police were called. 
</P>
<P>
	Police never found the weapon, which the boy said he gave to a  
friend, Greimel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy, whose name was not released because he is a juvenile,  
may have had a crush on the 13-year-old girl, Greimel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy, charged in juvenile court, was expected to be  
transferred to a juvenile facility. 
</P>
<P>
	He is a special-needs student with emotional problems, but he is  
not learning-disabled, district spokeswoman Michelle Baldwin said.

<HEADLINE>  A Weary Daly Resigns As Magic Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- All those road trips, all those late nights  
at hotels and airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Daly has had enough.  
</P>
<P>
	The 68-year-old coach quit the Orlando Magic on Monday, nine  
days after his team was upset in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, whose coaching career spanned two decades and included two  
NBA titles in Detroit, was in the final year of a three-year 
contract worth $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a great run, a great career,'' he said at a news  
conference. ``This is a finale for me in coaching. This will 
conclude my coaching career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said the Magic's playoff elimination by Philadelphia in  
four games and tensions with star Penny Hardaway didn't play a role 
in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway's future with the team is unclear and he plans to  
become a free agent this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time. It's as simple as that,'' Daly said. ``The mind is  
willing but the flesh is weak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said all the travel and games had taken a toll, and he  
decided it was time to leave coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a life. Three or four nights a week, bopping around at 2  
o'clock in the morning,'' Daly said. ``It's just time to leave the 
bench.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He will stay as a consultant to Magic general manager John  
Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
	``What that amounts to, I don't know,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Daly was joined at the news conference by four of his players --  
Darrell Armstrong, Nick Anderson, Horace Grant and Bo Outlaw -- who 
praised him for his coaching and for the opportunities he gave 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave me a different outlook on basketball and life,''  
Anderson said. ``He told me 'Just enjoy.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Gabriel said he would begin his search for a new coach in weeks.  
He praised Daly for his leadership and his willingness to try blend 
older and younger players. 
</P>
<P>
	``He pushed us to get better each and every day and his  
contributions will live on in this organization,'' Gabriel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando missed the playoffs in his first year, but this season  
tied for the second-best record in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the first-round playoff loss, Daly had described the  
lockout-shortened season as one of the most satisfying of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	His contract included a clause that gave him the option to  
continue coaching at $5 million a season, accept a position as a 
club consultant for $200,000 or leave Orlando for another job. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly coached the 1992 Olympic team to a gold medal in Barcelona.  
He and Lenny Wilkens are the only coaches to have won NBA and 
Olympic championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, who led the Pistons to titles in 1989 and 1990, was hired  
by the Magic on June 3, 1997 and had a 74-58 regular-season record 
in two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1994 and worked as a  
television analyst for three years before joining the Magic. He 
began his NBA coaching career with Cleveland in 1981-82 and guided 
the Pistons for nine seasons (1983-84 to 1991-92). Detroit had five 
50-plus victory seasons under Daly. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the Pistons, Daly took over the New Jersey Nets for  
two seasons and led them to the playoffs both years. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Magic failed to qualify for the postseason in 1998, it  
the marked the first time Daly missed the playoffs after coaching a 
full season. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly has a career regular-season record of 638-437 in 13 years.  
In 12 playoff appearances, his teams went 75-51.

<HEADLINE> Avis To Buy Cendant Fleet Managment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GARDEN CITY, N.Y. (AP) -- Avis Rent A Car Inc. is buying the auto  
fleet leasing and fuel card businesses from Cendant Corp. for about 
$1.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Avis officials said the deal announced today will help the  
nation's second biggest auto rental firm expand and diversify its 
commercial rental business, including gaining a foothold in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Avis, based in Garden City, is buying Cendant's PHH and Wright  
Express divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``PHH and Avis are a natural fit, since both companies  
principally serve corporate clients and there are a number of 
opportunities to cross-market to each other's customers,'' Avis 
executive vice president and chief financial officer Kevin Sheehan 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Cendant vice president Stephen Holmes said the deal represents a  
step in the formerly Parsippany, N.J.-based franchise giant's 
strategic realignment. It also provides Cendant, which is now based 
in New York, with a much-needed infusion of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Cendant controls 20 percent of Avis, which it spun off in 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	PHH provides vehicle services to 19,000 companies in North  
America and Europe. Its total worldwide fleet exceeds 700,000 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright Express provides fuel management services to commercial  
clients. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal has resulted from an auction process among several  
bidders. Avis officials said they expect to close the transaction 
by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Avis will finance the deal through a combination of debt and  
preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
	PHH and Wright Express will remain separate and operate under  
the leadership of their current management teams, Avis president 
and chief operating officer F. Robert Salerno said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their contributions will bring us closer to our vision of  
becoming the world's leading provider of full service automotive 
transportation and vehicle management solutions,'' Salerno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Avis also is acquiring two PHH subsidiaries, Cendant Business  
Answers (Europe) PLC and the Harpur Group Ltd. Both are leading 
vehicle services providers in the United Kingdom.

	Stocks End Down; Dow Off 174.61  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today as investors shed  
Internet and bank shares, fearing that profits will be hampered in 
coming months by threats as diverse as higher interest rates and 
the Year 2000 bug. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 
174.61, or by 1.6 percent, at 10,654.67. At one point late in the 
session, the blue-chip average had tumbled almost 203 points. After 
several listless sessions on Wall Street, investors seized upon 
some industry analysts' warnings as a catalyst for a selloff. Broad 
measures were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 23.64 to 
1,306.65, and the Nasdaq composite fell 66.54 to 2,453.60.

	HAMPTON, Va. (AP) -- Negotiators for Newport News Shipbuilding,  
the nation's only builder of aircraft carriers, and the United 
Steelworkers met today for the first time since before the union 
went on strike seven weeks ago. Spokesmen for both sides said they 
hoped the meeting arranged by federal mediators would lead to a 
contract agreement and the end of the strike. Shipyard spokesman 
Mike Hatfield would not say whether the yard was willing to budge 
from what it called its final contract offer, which it delivered

	Oil Cos. Lack National Y2K Plan

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The oil and gas industry, with its dependence  
on computers, has too many question marks about its plans to deal 
with Year 2000 computer problems, a congressional report concludes. 
The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, 
said that while individual companies are confronting possible 
problems, no national-level approach has emerged to deal with 
shortages or disruptions in the nation's oil and gas supplies. 
Citing an industry survey taken in February, the GAO said more than 
a quarter of the industry does not expect to be Y2K ready until the 
second half of 1999, ``leaving little time for resolving unexpected 
problems.''

	FTC Allowed To Regulate Nonprofits

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court said today tht the Federal  
Trade Commission has the authority to regulate at least some 
nonprofit professional groups, such as dental associations, in an 
effort to protect competition. But the justices ordered lower 
courts to take a closer look to determine whether the FTC properly 
invalidated the California Dental Association's limits on dentist 
advertising. The FTC said the association's rules would bar even 
truthful ads. All nine justices agreed that the FTC's authority to 
oversee for-profit corporations also extends to nonprofit 
professional groups that provide substantial economic benefits to 
their for-profit members.

shockwave.com, will operate a Web site by the same name. The site 
will guide users to games, puzzles and animation created by 
Macromedia's Shockwave and Flash technology, the company said 
today. On the Web site, users will be able to download two pieces 
of software that play Shockwave files. The free Shockwave Remote

the National Labor Relations Board again rejected their union 
petition. An appeal was expected by the United Food and Commercial 
Workers Local 56, which has sought to represent more than 650 
private practice doctors in collective bargaining. The case is

doctors try to unionize in frustration at the way HMOs control

not give a reason, but Chinese authorities are trying to muzzle 
potential sources of dissent ahead of the 10th anniversary of the 
June 4, 1989, crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen

is expected to declare the multibillion dollar cybercity, known as 
Cyberjaya, officially open on July 8. Cyberjaya is part of the 
country's Multimedia Super Corridor. The zone, roughly the size of 
neighboring Singapore, will be bound by fiber-optic wires linking 
new megaprojects with the international airport and a new federal 
capital called Putrajaya, where Mahathir will shift offices in 
June.

	Job Market Should Stay Strong  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The job market should remain strong through the  
summer, with the highest demand for workers expected in Western 
states, according to a survey released today. A quarterly survey of 
more than 15,000 companies by Manpower Inc. reported that 32 
percent planned to increase hiring in the third quarter. Just 6

The remaining 4 percent were unsure, the survey said. The figures

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed this morning as investors  
awaited the next indication of whether inflation is threatening the 
vibrant U.S. economy. Just before 11 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones 
industrial average was down 2.65 at 10,826.63. Broader stock 
indicators were mostly lower. The Nasdaq composite index was down 
31.93 at 2,488.21. Investors spent last week on the sidelines, 
weighing the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates 
unchanged and its accompanying warning that it is ready to raise 
interest rates if inflation is rekindled. Today, it appeared that 
investors are continuing their own watch.

	Court Rejects Rent Control Challenge  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today rejected a challenge  
to California cities' power to limit rents without having to prove 
at trial that the controls are achieving their goals. The justices, 
without comment, let stand a California Supreme Court ruling that 
leaves it to the state Legislature to decide whether rent control 
laws need to be changed or repealed. The state court ruling, 
reached by a 4-3 vote last January, upheld a voter-approved 1979 
rent control ordinance in Santa Monica, one of the state's 
toughest.

	Japan Trade Surplus Falls in April  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's trade surplus with the world slipped 12.6  
percent in April from the same month last year in an indication 
that growth in the imbalance may be slowing, the government said 
today. The merchandise trade surplus, the measure of all goods 
exported by Japan minus those imported, decreased to 1.069 trillion 
yen, or $8.62 billion, the Finance Ministry said. The April surplus 
was slightly lower than the average forecast of 1.099 trillion yen 
by Tokyo-based economists. 

</P>

	Toyota Profits Fall  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp.'s profit fell 22 percent in the  
latest fiscal year as weak sales at home and in Asia by Japan's 
biggest carmaker more than offset an increase in exports to North 
America. Toyota's group net income reported today totaled 356.1 
billion yen, or $2.9 billion, for the fiscal year ended March 31 
versus 454.3 billion yen a year earlier. Toyota attributed the 
decline to falling sales in Japan where consumer demand has 
weakened amid the country's deepest postwar recession.

16,390.49 points. On Friday, the average closed up 92.99 points, or 
0.57 percent. The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key 
indicator of blue chips, rose 164.72 points, or 1.3 percent, to 
12,436.86. Malaysian shares closed sharply lower as retailers took 
profit following spectacular gains last week, traders said. The

points, or 3.4 percent, to 743.34.

covered 126 countries and was worth $1.85 billion. Coca Cola stock 
was down 5/16 at 67 11/16 this morning. Cadbury's ADR is down 1/2 to

	Settlement With DeLorean Trustee  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The accounting firm Arthur Andersen has agreed to  
pay $27.75 million as part of a settlement with the bankruptcy 
trustee for DeLorean Motor Co., the trustee said today. The lawsuit 
stemmed from allegations that Arthur Andersen signed off on 
DeLorean's financial statements despite potential evidence of 
fraud. In March 1998, a jury in New York State Supreme Court found 
in favor of DeLorean's trustee, ordering Arthur Anderson to pay 
$46.2 million. The accounting firm had filed a motion asking the 
court to set aside the verdict, but the two sides reached the 
settlement Friday, trustee David W. Allard Jr. said today. ``I 
think this is an excellent settlement for the creditors,'' Allard 
said.

	Gas Prices Finally Drop

	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- The 2 1/2-month climb in gasoline prices  
has reversed itself, dropping 1.57 cents per gallon nationwide 
since May 7, and likely to keep falling, according to an industry 
analyst. The high prices had been blamed on the oil refining 
industry's decision to increase supplies of fuel for early summer 
driving, said Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg Survey of 
10,000 gasoline stations. By Friday, the national weighted average, 
including all grades with taxes, was $1.218 per gallon, Ms. 
Lundberg said Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Supreme Court took the following actions Monday:  
</P>
<P>
	--Decided that police who let the news media accompany them into  
people's homes to observe arrests or searches can be sued for 
violating the Constitution's Fourth Amendment protection against 
unreasonable searches. The court ruled unanimously in a pair of 
cases from Maryland and Montana. ``The possibility of good public 
relations for the police is simply not enough, standing alone, to 
justify the ride-along intrusion into a private home,'' Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote in the Maryland case. 
</P>
<P>
	--Turned down an appeal by a Maine dentist who was sued for  
refusing to treat a woman in his office because she has the virus 
that causes AIDS. Dentist Randon Bragdon argued that the Americans 
with Disabilities Act allowed him to conclude that filling the 
woman's cavity would pose a ``direct threat'' to his health and 
safety. The same case was the subject of a major Supreme Court 
decision last June, when the justices said people infected with HIV 
can sue under the ADA. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ruled 5-4 in a California case that people at least sometimes  
can get a jury trial when they invoke a much-used civil rights law 
and sue in federal court over local governmental land-use 
regulations. The justices upheld a $1.45 million award against the 
city of Monterey, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ruled unanimously that the Federal Trade Commission has the  
authority to regulate at least some nonprofit professional groups, 
such as dental associations, in an effort to protect competition. 
But the justices, voting 5-4, ordered lower courts to take a closer 
look to determine whether the FTC properly invalidated the 
California Dental Association's limits on dentist advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	--Made it easier for disabled workers to sue their employers over  
alleged discrimination after they seek Social Security disability 
benefits. Voting unanimously in a Texas case, the justices said 
courts cannot presume that people who apply for such benefits are 
admitting they are unqualified to hold a job. Someone must be 
qualified for a job to file a discrimination lawsuit under the 
Americans with Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allowed Georgia to require a runoff election when no political  
candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote in a primary 
election. The justices let stand lower rulings that said the 
majority-vote requirement does not discriminate against black 
voters and candidates.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Force Noncommercial Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to force the  
city of Phoenix to accept noncommercial advertisements, such as 
religious and political messages, for display on the outside of 
city buses. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, turned away arguments by a religious  
group and the Arizona Civil Liberties Union that the city violates 
free-speech rights by renting space on public transit buses only 
for commercial advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices had been asked to reconsider the court's 1974  
ruling that allowed an Ohio city to bar political advertising on 
public transit vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Children of the Rosary, a religious group, successfully sued  
Phoenix in 1995 over its policy of excluding political and 
religious messages from city buses. 
</P>
<P>
	In November 1996, a new city policy took effect that limited bus  
advertising to ``speech which proposes a commercial transaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soon afterward, the city rejected an advertisement from Children  
of the Rosary that contained a quote from the Bible, the phrase 
``choose life,'' and stated, ``Purchase this message as a 
bumpersticker for your vehicle.'' City officials said the ad was 
primarily noncommercial. 
</P>
<P>
	The city also rejected an ACLU ad that said, ``The ACLU supports  
free speech for everyone'' and gave a phone number to buy a bumper 
sticker with that message. 
</P>
<P>
	Children of the Rosary and the ACLU sued in 1997, saying the  
advertising standard violated the Constitution's First Amendment, 
which protects freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled against the challengers. Phoenix's bus  
advertising is a nonpublic forum, the judge said, adding that the 
policy was a reasonable way to protect a city revenue source and 
maintain neutrality on political and religious issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed in an opinion  
written by retired Supreme Court Justice Byron R. White, a visiting 
member of that court. The city can exclude such speech from a 
nonpublic forum as long as it does not discriminate against 
particular viewpoints, White wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the religious group  
and the ACLU suggested commercial speech should not be given 
greater protection than noncommercial speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Children of the Rosary vs. Phoenix, 98-1433.

<HEADLINE> Elizabeth Dole Pushes Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- With a bottle of children's aspirin in  
her right hand and a handgun trigger lock in her left, Republican 
presidential hopeful Elizabeth Dole asked Yale Medical School 
graduates on Monday why the government requires a safety cap for 
one and not the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will protect our children,'' said Dole, holding up the  
black trigger lock. ``It will also help you as future physicians, 
so you don't have to treat accidentally wounded children in 
hospital emergency rooms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to 123 new doctors and their families, Dole sought to  
distance herself from the other GOP presidential candidates on the 
issue of gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leadership requires more than sitting on the sidelines  
measuring which direction the gun smoke is blowing,'' she said, an 
apparent reference to Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP 
front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	She had planned to make similar remarks at Saturday's state  
Republican convention in Georgia, but was unable to do so because 
of laryngitis. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked last week about Mrs. Dole's planned remarks, Mindy Tucker,  
a spokeswoman for Bush, said: ``Gov. Bush has a record in office of 
enacting tough laws on those who commit crimes with a gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said that as president she would sign a bill passed last  
week by the U.S. Senate requiring background checks for weapon 
sales at gun shows and child safety locks on all guns. 
</P>
<P>
	She pointed to recent shootings at schools in Littleton, Colo.,  
and Conyers, Ga., as reason enough to restrict the constitutional 
right to bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``You who have dedicated your life to saving lives will surely  
understand the importance of a debate that is underway in 
Washington,'' Dole said. ``As we stop and pray for those affected 
by this tragedy, let's also stop and think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former American Red Cross president also reiterated her  
belief that no civilian needs an assault rifle. ``I cannot imagine 
why any family would need an AK-47 to protect themselves or to go 
hunting. They should be banned,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although her remarks on gun control were obviously  
well-received, some graduates said she didn't go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've already seen quite a bit of street violence,'' said  
Jessica Haberer, 26, of Phoenix, who plans to specialize in 
internal medicine in San Francisco. ``I would take a much stronger 
stance. I don't think a lock on the gun is going to make a 
difference.''

<HEADLINE> Switched Baby's Mom Sues Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- The mother of one of two babies switched at  
birth at the University of Virginia hospital has filed a $31 
million lawsuit that accuses physicians, nurses and administrators 
of negligence and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	In her lawsuit filed Monday, Paula Johnson has suffered mental  
pain and anguish since learning through genetic tests last summer 
that she was given the wrong baby to take home in July 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson also suffered the loss of companionship of her  
biological child, according to the lawsuit filed in Stafford County 
Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson has raised Callie Conley since she brought her home  
from the hospital. She gave birth to Rebecca Chittum, who was taken 
home by another family and now lives in Buena Vista. 
</P>
<P>
	Steuart Thomas and Gregory Lucyk, the attorneys representing the  
state-run hospital, called the lawsuit ``unfortunate for both 
children'' and the amount being sought ``exorbitant and 
excessive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rebecca's two sets of grandparents have custody of her because  
her parents -- Kevin Chittum and Whitney Rogers -- died in a car 
crash last July, shortly before the switch was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Rebecca's grandparents accepted a settlement worth $2  
million from the state-run hospital, but Ms. Johnson and attorneys 
representing the state could not agree on compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson's lawyer, John Blakely, said the state's attorneys  
rejected Ms. Johnson's offer to accept a $1 million settlement and 
offered to pay just $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't appear there is any hope for a settlement,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks $12 million in compensatory damages and $12  
million in punitive damages from the state, and also seeks $7 
million in damages the hospital's chief executive and chief of 
staff.

<HEADLINE> Lennon Dedicates Album to Stepdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Julian Lennon says his first album in seven  
years, ``Photograph Smile,'' is dedicated to his late stepfather, 
Roberto Bassanini. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the one who took me to school every day. He was the  
guy,'' Lennon says in the upcoming USA Weekend magazine. 
</P>

	As for his biological father, John Lennon: ``The only thing he  
taught me was how not to be a father.''

	The Beatle split from Julian Lennon's mother, Cynthia, when  
Julian was 5 years old. Julian Lennon, 36, said he saw John only 
about a dozen times after the divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	``He walked out the bloody door and was never around,'' he said.  
``I'd admire him on TV -- listen to his words and opinions. But for 
someone who was praised for peace and love and wasn't able to keep 
that at home, that's hypocrisy.''

<HEADLINE> A Hollywood Plan for the NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Leave it to Hollywood to bedazzle NFL owners.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael Ovitz, the show business agent who heads one of two  
groups bidding for the new Los Angeles franchise, has a plan for 
the Los Angeles Coliseum that includes everything from a parking 
garage covered with trees, grass in front of luxury suites and even 
a cooling system that would spray mist on fans in hot weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, first reported Sunday in the Los Angeles Times, will  
be presented to the owners at their spring meetings Tuesday and 
Wednesday. League officials confirmed the newspaper report that the 
plan had impressed most of the owners who had seen it. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day meeting will be involved primarily with settling  
some of the NFL's franchise issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners are expected to approve the sale of the Washington  
Redskins to Edward Snyder for $800 million. Snyder was a member of 
the group headed by Howard Milstein that withdrew after it became 
apparent the owners wouldn't approve it. 
</P>
<P>
	They also are expected to discuss the New England Patriots'  
decision to stay in the Boston area after withdrawing a commitment 
they had made to Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	But Los Angeles may be the most pressing issue.  
</P>
<P>
	At the March meetings, the league tentatively awarded Los  
Angeles the 32nd franchise over Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	But the NFL told the California city that it needed to come up  
with a viable plan by September. And there still are two groups 
vying for the franchise -- one headed by Ovitz and the other by real 
estate moguls Eli Broad and Ed Roski. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL already has chosen the Coliseum, the Roski-Broad site,  
as the setting for the new stadium. But Ovitz's plan may give his 
group the edge in getting the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal, designed by architect David Rockwell, is called  
``The Coliseum at Exposition Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking Central Park here and a unique recreation  
environment with the stadium standing as a monument in the 
middle,'' the Times quoted an unidentified NFL official as saying. 
``It just blew everyone away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't guarantee Ovitz will get the franchise, which would  
replace the Rams and Raiders, who defected to St. Louis and Oakland 
after the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broad-Roski group claims to hold a special right to bring  
the NFL back to the Coliseum. If the owners decide on Ovitz's plan, 
their claim could hurt Los Angeles' chance of meeting the Sept. 15 
deadline set to the owners. 
</P>
<P>
	League officials also have said if Los Angeles seemed close to a  
new plan, it might be considered to have met the deadline.

<HEADLINE> A Weary Daly Resigns As Magic Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- All those road trips, all those late nights  
at hotels and airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Daly has had enough.  
</P>
<P>
	The 68-year-old coach quit the Orlando Magic on Monday, nine  
days after his team was upset in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, whose coaching career spanned two decades and included two  
NBA titles in Detroit, was in the final year of a three-year 
contract worth $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a great run, a great career,'' he said at a news  
conference. ``This is a finale for me in coaching. This will 
conclude my coaching career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said the Magic's playoff elimination by Philadelphia in  
four games and tensions with star Penny Hardaway didn't play a role 
in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway's future with the team is unclear and he plans to  
become a free agent this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time. It's as simple as that,'' Daly said. ``The mind is  
willing but the flesh is weak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said all the travel and games had taken a toll, and he  
decided it was time to leave coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a life. Three or four nights a week, bopping around at 2  
o'clock in the morning,'' Daly said. ``It's just time to leave the 
bench.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He will stay as a consultant to Magic general manager John  
Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
	``What that amounts to, I don't know,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Daly was joined at the news conference by four of his players --  
Darrell Armstrong, Nick Anderson, Horace Grant and Bo Outlaw -- who 
praised him for his coaching and for the opportunities he gave 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave me a different outlook on basketball and life,''  
Anderson said. ``He told me 'Just enjoy.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Gabriel said he would begin his search for a new coach in weeks.  
He praised Daly for his leadership and his willingness to try blend 
older and younger players. 
</P>
<P>
	``He pushed us to get better each and every day and his  
contributions will live on in this organization,'' Gabriel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando missed the playoffs in his first year, but this season  
tied for the second-best record in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the first-round playoff loss, Daly had described the  
lockout-shortened season as one of the most satisfying of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	His contract included a clause that gave him the option to  
continue coaching at $5 million a season, accept a position as a 
club consultant for $200,000 or leave Orlando for another job. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly coached the 1992 Olympic team to a gold medal in Barcelona.  
He and Lenny Wilkens are the only coaches to have won NBA and 
Olympic championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, who led the Pistons to titles in 1989 and 1990, was hired  
by the Magic on June 3, 1997 and had a 74-58 regular-season record 
in two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1994 and worked as a  
television analyst for three years before joining the Magic. He 
began his NBA coaching career with Cleveland in 1981-82 and guided 
the Pistons for nine seasons (1983-84 to 1991-92). Detroit had five 
50-plus victory seasons under Daly. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the Pistons, Daly took over the New Jersey Nets for  
two seasons and led them to the playoffs both years. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Magic failed to qualify for the postseason in 1998, it  
the marked the first time Daly missed the playoffs after coaching a 
full season. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly has a career regular-season record of 638-437 in 13 years.  
In 12 playoff appearances, his teams went 75-51.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Volunteers to Mentor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saluting theirs as ``a better way to live,''  
President Clinton urged a sea of enthusiastic young volunteers 
Monday to preach their message of teamwork and service to youths 
who feel alienated from society. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton addressed the 10th anniversary celebration of the City  
Year service organization and asked the 1,000 attendees to set 
examples for other young adults. He cited the recent wave of school 
violence and said he was struck by the descriptions of 
disengagement and anger experienced by the youths accused of 
carrying them out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that community service can have a profound impact in  
diminishing, even erasing, the sense of alienation and isolation so 
many of our young people feel,'' Clinton said at the rally at 
Howard University. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said many of the volunteers might also have felt  
upset or resentful at times, but they managed to keep going and 
become a part of something larger than themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	He called on the group to mentor and speak to other children and  
encourage them to participate in activities that give them a sense 
of purpose like community service. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can tell them that no matter what has happened, no matter  
what's bugging them, no matter who is dissing them, no matter what 
they have to have a beef about, real or imagined, what you're doing 
is a better way to live, and they ought to join you and live that 
way, too,'' Clinton said to resounding cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	City Year, which works alongside AmeriCorps, is a one-year  
service program for young people age 17 to 24 in 11 cities across 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Spaloss of New Hampshire welcomed the president and  
described the impact of his first meeting with Clinton in 1991. A 
presidential candidate at the time, Clinton visited the group's 
convention in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``He challenged me to commit myself to a lifetime of service,''  
said Spaloss, who went on to serve with the program in founding 
branches in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also used Monday's event to push for expansion of  
AmeriCorps. He has proposed an additional $113 million for the 
program next year, with the goal of supporting 100,000 members a 
year by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation has ``both the unique obligation, and because of our  
prosperity and security, a unique opportunity to galvanize people 
as never before in the cause of citizen service,'' the president 
said.

<HEADLINE> Toyota Profits Fall 22 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Weak auto sales both domestically and  
internationally pushed Toyota Motor Corp.'s profit down 22 percent 
in the latest fiscal year, despite an increase in exports to North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota's group net income reported Monday totaled 356.1 billion  
yen, or $2.9 billion, for the fiscal year ended March 31 vs. 454.3 
billion yen a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota attributed the decline to falling sales in Japan where  
consumer demand has weakened amid the country's deepest postwar 
recession. At the same time, Toyota's exports to Asia fell by 
nearly half as demand crumbled in countries struck by the nearly 
two-year-old economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Group sales rose from last year, but the increase was due  
largely to Daihatsu Motor Co. and IDO Corp. joining the Toyota 
group. Daihatsu makes small-cars and trucks and IDO is a 
cellular-phone service provider. Toyota acquired majority stakes in 
the companies last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota said group sales rose 9 percent to 12.7 trillion yen, or  
$102 billion, from 11.7 trillion yen a year earlier. The number of 
vehicles sold rose 1.2 percent to 1.93 million in Japan and rose 
8.5 percent to 2.8 million overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	But excluding the effect of adding Daihatsu to the group,  
vehicle sales figures were more bleak. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports of Toyota and Lexus cars from Japan fell 5.8 percent to  
1.4 million vehicles as exports to Asia dropped 47 percent to 
78,109 vehicles. That drop more than offset a rise in exports to 
North America of 7.8 percent to 573,756 cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Toyota vehicles in Japan -- excluding the addition of  
Daihatsu -- fell 13 percent to 1.7 million vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The bleak economic environment is expected to continue this  
year, Okijima said, though the company is hoping the economy will 
pick up in the second half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments Monday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Toyota said it would move the listing of its stock to the New  
York Stock Exchange from the Nasdaq Stock Market this year and to 
list its shares in London. The moves are aimed at making the shares 
more accessible for foreign investors, said Okijima. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Toyota closed down 12 1/2 cents to $53.87 1/2.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Toyota said the top management at Toyota Motor Sales USA would  
change. Among other shifts, Yoshio Ishizaka, president and CEO of 
the division since mid-1996, was promoted to senior managing 
director of Toyota Motor Corp. He will be succeeded by Yoshimi 
Inaba.

<HEADLINE> The Dome Rises and a Feud Boils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Capitol dome is, purely and simply, a  
paramount symbol of the United States, an image engraved on the 
national mind like the Statue of Liberty and the faces on Mount 
Rushmore. 
</P>
<P>
	The dome's image is everywhere and has been since it was topped  
off with the 19 1/2-foot statue of Armed Freedom in the midst of the 
Civil War, the cannons in 12 forts surrounding Washington booming 
salutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Everywhere, as in its floodlit image glowing from millions of  
television screens in the moments before a president's State of the 
Union address, the light in the lantern near its top a signal that 
Congress is in session. 
</P>
<P>
	Advertisements, book jackets, patriotic prints and hundreds of  
thousands of political cartoons have employed the image of the 
white-painted Capitol dome. 
</P>
<P>
	At its western base, where presidents since Ronald Reagan have  
been inaugurated, the dome faces the Mall, the storehouse of 
national history, the White House, the city of power, lawyers and 
lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dome didn't rise to its place on the skyline without the  
familiar accompaniment of a first-class Washington power struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	Intervention by Congress led to a wounding personal feud between  
the dome's architect and the ``reckless egotism'' of the ambitious 
Army engineer employed to supervise construction. The battle played 
out against the backdrop of the nation's widening sectional gulf 
and the fast-approaching Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	The story of the building of the dome is told by William C.  
Allen, chief architectural historian in the office of the Architect 
of the Capitol, in ``The Dome of the United States Capitol,'' 
published as a Senate document in 1992. Allen now is writing a 
full-scale history of the Capitol's architecture. 
</P>
<P>
	The two principal actors were Thomas U. Walter, one of the  
leading architects of his time, and Montgomery C. Meigs, an Army 
captain and talented engineer determined to stamp the dome with his 
personality and name. 
</P>
<P>
	In the near background was Meigs' sponsor, U.S. Secretary of War  
Jefferson Davis, soon to be president of the Confederate States of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	A dome had been on the national wish list since the 1790s, when  
America's leaders saw architecture as a way to express the pride 
and permanence of both the new Capitol and the fledgling nation. 
</P>
<P>
	But no dome rose until the 1830s, and it was a modest effort at  
best. By the time the capital was ready for expansion in the early 
1850s the existing dome was widely scorned as a ``washbowl turned 
upside down,'' hardly the transcendent symbol Thomas Jefferson had 
envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
	The new vision came from the drawing board of Walter, a  
Philadelphia architect who had impressed Congress with his design 
for a new Capitol library, made entirely of molded iron. 
</P>
<P>
	While Walter would use marble for the new House and Senate  
wings, the central dome resting on the old stone walls would also 
be made of industrial-age iron from top to bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	But Congress inserted a stinging irritant into the mix, asking  
the War Department to assign an officer to supervise construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Meigs, Davis' choice for the job, immediately overstepped his  
mandate of managing contracts and supervising construction. He 
demanded a premier role in design and decoration of the dome, down 
to his name stamped on its iron parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Meigs saw the dome as his chance for immortality. Walter saw an  
attack on the professional stature of architecture itself. 
</P>
<P>
	In a long series of events, Meigs demanded all of Walter's  
drawings be turned over to him, refused to authorize pay for his 
draftsmen, quarreled openly with him in the press, tried to 
undermine his reputation, ordered him fired and, when all else 
failed, posted a sentry on his office door to keep him out. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter described the situation as ``open war'' against ``the  
despotism of a military upstart who happens to have the power to 
annoy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``During the two-year battle between Meigs and Walter,  
construction of the dome slowed to a crawl. The drafting room 
continued to produce elegant drawings, but these were not sent to 
Meigs for fear of alteration or mutilation,'' Allen writes. 
</P>
<P>
	But time for petty quarrels was running out. Southern states  
seceded from the Union. Davis went with them to head the rebel 
government. Promoted to major general, Meigs ran the supply effort 
for federal forces and, spitefully, buried Union dead on the 
grounds of Robert E. Lee's Virginia mansion, the beginnings of 
Arlington National Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Confederate pickets across the Potomac could see the dome  
continue to rise to its overall height of 287 feet, six inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter's wife called it ``that magnificent dome.'' No one  
contradicted her. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Down in T-Bill Sale / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities declined in Monday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.5 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.495 percent, down from 4.570 percent last 
week. An additional $7.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.570 percent, down from 4.630 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the lowest since May 10, when the bills  
sold for 4.480 percent. The six-month rate was the lowest since May 
10, when the rate was 4.510 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.621 percent for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,886.40, and 4.756 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,767.70. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 4.89 
percent last week from 4.79 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> New York Times Groups Web Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Times Co. is grouping its nearly 50  
Web sites under one business unit, the company announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new division, Times Company Digital, will control all the  
company's Internet operations, including the site for the company's 
flagship newspaper, nytimes.com, which currently has some 7 million 
registered subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sites under the new unit include a regional information  
site for New England, boston.com, which is run by The Boston Globe, 
one of the company's newspapers. The division will also run a New 
York City guide called nytoday.com and winetoday.com, a year-old 
site for wine enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Sulzberger, Jr., chairman of the company, said the  
consolidation move ``significantly advances our ability to build a 
high-quality, high-value Internet presence and to respond even more 
quickly to the fast-moving Web marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 50 Web sites are expected to generate revenues between $24  
million and $26 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Times Co. spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen said the company  
has no immediate plans to sell shares in its Internet division. 
But, she added, ``we are always looking to increase the value of 
our company for shareholders, so this is something we have explored 
and will continue to look at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other media companies have also consolidated their Internet  
holdings, and some have announced plans to offer shares in the 
subsidiaries to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, special-interest magazine publisher Primedia Inc.  
announced plans to create two subsidiaries to manage its online 
operations. Computer magazine publisher Ziff-Davis Inc. has issued 
a tracking stock for its ZDNet Group, and Barnes &AMP; Noble is hoping 
to sell shares in its online bookstore.

<HEADLINE> Switched Baby's Mom Sues Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- The mother of one of two babies accidentally  
switched at birth at the University of Virginia hospital filed a 
$31 million lawsuit on Monday that accuses physicians, nurses and 
administrators of negligence and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Paula Johnson has suffered mental pain and anguish since  
learning through genetic tests last summer that she was given the 
wrong baby to take home in July 1995, her lawsuit claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson also suffered the loss of companionship of her  
biological child, according to the lawsuit filed in Stafford County 
Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson has raised Callie Conley since she brought her home  
from the hospital. She gave birth to Rebecca Chittum, who was taken 
home by another family and now lives in Buena Vista. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement released by Steuart Thomas and Gregory Lucyk, the  
attorneys representing the state-run hospital, called the lawsuit 
``unfortunate for both children'' and the amount being sought 
``exorbitant and excessive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rebecca's two sets of grandparents have custody of her because  
her parents -- Kevin Chittum and Whitney Rogers -- died in a car 
crash last July, shortly before the switch was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Rebecca's grandparents accepted a settlement worth $2  
million from the state-run hospital, but Ms. Johnson and attorneys 
representing the state could not agree on compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson's lawyer, John Blakely, said the state's attorneys  
rejected Ms. Johnson's offer to accept a $1 million settlement and 
offered to pay just $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't appear there is any hope for a settlement,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks $12 million in compensatory damages and $12  
million in punitive damages from the state, and also seeks $7 
million in damages the hospital's chief executive and chief of 
staff.

<HEADLINE> Attorney: NYC Cop To Plead Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A police officer accused of torturing a prisoner  
inside a police stationhouse will change his plea to guilty, his 
lawyer told a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``If your honor can see fit to give us some time tomorrow we  
would like to enter a plea,'' attorney Marvyn Kornberg, lawyer for 
Officer Justin Volpe, said Monday in a private discussion with the 
trial judge made available through a transcript. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe is the central figure in an ongoing trial of five officers  
charged with violating the civil rights of a black Haitian 
immigrant, who testified he was sodomized with a broom handle and 
beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the plea came after several days of testimony by four  
police officers who said they saw Volpe brandishing a stick the 
night he allegedly tortured Abner Louima inside a bathroom of a 
Brooklyn police station on Aug. 9, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The case against the four remaining officers was expected to  
proceed. A source connected with the prosecution who requested 
anonymity said there is no agreement with Volpe on a recommended 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Kornberg and the prosecutor refused to comment on the plea.  
</P>
<P>
	Volpe is charged with several civil rights violations. An  
alleged violation pertaining to the bathroom assault carries a 
maximum sentence of life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, 27, is accused of ramming a stick into Louima's rectum  
and mouth in a fit of rage because he mistakenly thought Louima, 
32, punched him in a disturbance outside a Brooklyn nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe's co-defendants, officers Charles Schwarz, Thomas Wiese  
and Thomas Bruder, are charged with violating Louima's rights by 
taking turns beating him en route to the station. Schwarz also is 
accused of holding down Louima in the bathroom attack. 
</P>
<P>
	A fifth defendant, Sgt. Michael Bellomo, is charged with  
covering up the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Kornberg abruptly stopped cross-examining prosecution witnesses  
last week, telling reporters he had changed his strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	The normally combative Kornberg had implied in opening  
statements he would try to show that Louima was injured during 
consensual sex before he got involved with police. The discussion 
about the plea took place at the end of testimony Monday in which a 
surgeon discussed Louima's injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	But four former and current precinct patrolmen testified they  
had seen Volpe wielding a stick on the morning of the bathroom 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima had told the jury that Volpe put an object in his rectum,  
pulled it out and put it in his mouth. He testified Volpe ``told me 
if I ever talk to anyone about what happened to me, he kill me and 
everybody in my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detective Eric Turetzky testified seeing Schwarz lead a  
handcuffed Louima, whose pants were at his ankles, toward the 
bathroom. Later, a disheveled and sullen Volpe ``was swinging the 
stick around like a sword and hitting it against the wall,'' the 
detective said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Mark Schofield testified that Volpe borrowed a pair of  
black leather gloves from him before the alleged attack and 
returned them covered with blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Kornberg, along with other defense attorneys, attacked the  
credibility of Turetzky and Schofield for coming forward only after 
it became clear internal affairs investigators would be 
interviewing them anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense went silent Wednesday when a burly sergeant named  
Kenneth Wernick appeared as a surprise witness. In an account never 
before made public, he testified that Volpe bragged, ``I took a man 
down tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe then took him into the bathroom to see the 2- to 3-foot  
stick, which was stashed by a sink, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kornberg declined to question both Wernick and a second surprise  
witness, Officer Michael Schoer, who testified Volpe had taunted 
him by putting the end of an excrement-soiled stick in his face.

<HEADLINE> WB Shelves Violent 'Buffy' Episode </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the second time in a month, the WB  
television network has shelved an episode of ``Buffy, the Vampire 
Slayer'' put of concern for depictions of violence following the 
spate of high school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB won't air Tuesday's planned season finale, the second of  
a two-part episode, until sometime in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Networks are clearly becoming more skittish about violent  
content following the April 20 shooting in Colorado's Columbine 
High School, which left 13 students and the two gunmen dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, CBS's president said he decided not to put a violent  
drama series about the mob on his fall schedule because of 
Columbine. Fox executives also said they would carefully monitor 
the content of two new dramas, one about a teen-aged police officer 
and the other about a violent ``virtual reality'' game. 
</P>
<P>
	During Tuesday's episode of ``Buffy,'' a solar eclipse occurs  
during a high school graduation ceremony and the town's mayor turns 
into a serpent. He attacks the students, who defend themselves with 
stakes, bows, arrows and other implements. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the current climate, depicting acts of violence at a  
high school graduation ceremony, even fantasy acts against 60-foot 
serpents and vampires, we believe, is inappropriate to broadcast 
around the actual dates of these time-honored ceremonies,'' said 
Jamie Kellner, the network's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellner said the decision was made ``out of sympathy and  
compassion'' for families and communities affected by high school 
violence and out of responsibility for the WB's young audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision will be explained to viewers on the air Tuesday  
night, he said. A rerun episode of the series will run instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We apologize to the millions of loyal `Buffy' viewers who are  
eagerly anticipating this episode,'' Kellner said. 
</P>
<P>
	With programs that heavily appeal to a teen-aged audience, the  
WB has a younger viewership than any other broadcast network. 
``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer,'' starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, is 
about a teen-aged vampire and is one of the WB's most popular shows 
critically and commercially. 
</P>
<P>
	The week following the Columbine shooting, the WB pulled a  
``Buffy'' episode where there was a fantasy sequence about high 
school carnage. That episode will be shown later this year, the 
network said.

<HEADLINE> Fine Line Between Harassing, Teasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Schools in North Carolina and New York City  
were accused of going too far when they suspended small boys -- a 
first-grader and a second-grader -- for kissing female classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, school officials say the Supreme Court's ruling Monday in a  
Georgia case means they will face new difficulties in 
distinguishing illegal harassment from rambunctious teasing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next year kids will be suspended for behavior nobody's ever  
been suspended for, and parents will ask why,'' said Bruce Hunter 
of the American Association of School Administrators. ``But I don't 
see any way of avoiding that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schools -- from elementary to colleges -- that accept federal  
money can be sued by victims of such harassment, the court said in 
its 5-4 ruling. The case stems from a fifth-grade girl suing the 
Monroe County, Ga., school board, saying a classmate harassed her 
despite complaints to officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Some districts had policies taking a student's age, prior  
conduct, and intent into account, but the Supreme Court decision 
made it clear they need stronger harassment policies to back up 
their actions, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Dumas, superintendent of the Monroe County schools, said  
that in the four years since the case began, the district has made 
some changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a program now that talks about the difference between  
a good touch and bad touch,'' he said. ``We're starting even in 
primary school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What officials don't see is schools backing off the issue.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is rare to find a school or college that does not  
respond,'' said Norma Cantu, the Education Department's civil 
rights chief. ``We want common sense. Cases should not be 
exaggerated or ignored. The Supreme Court decision is urging common 
sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schools have had their share of problems in trying to determine  
what is common sense in addressing peer harassment: 
</P>
<P>
	--Last year, officials in a Peterborough, N.H., high school were  
criticized for not immediately expelling a 17-year-old boy charged 
with sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl. The boy, who served a 
20-day suspension, was allowed back into school because the school 
board's investigation didn't support other disciplinary action 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
	--In 1997, prosecutors in Arlington, Va., abruptly dropped a sex  
charge against a 9-year-old fourth-grade boy who was accused of 
rubbing against a 9-year-old girl in a sexual manner in a school 
lunch line. The boy's family said he accidentally brushed against 
the girl. 
</P>
<P>
	--In 1996, a state court held an Antioch, Calif., school district  
liable for violating a state harassment law and gave $500,000 to 
the family of a 6th-grade girl who said a boy in her class 
repeatedly called her ``slut'' and other vulgarities and threatened 
her physically. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents, who are often the source of the official complaints,  
should have a role in deciding those local policies, said Patty 
Yoxall, spokeswoman of the National Parent Teacher Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a double-edged sword,'' said Arizona State Board of  
Education spokeswoman Patricia Likens. ``You may see more lawsuits 
that are more justified, or you may see parents jumping to 
conclusions. But the onus is on the districts. They are going to 
have to tread lightly on this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Underwood, general counsel for the National Association of  
School Boards, believes the court's ruling could actually prevent 
schools from overreacting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The standard is pervasive sexual harassment. If the court had  
left it at all sexual harassment, schools would be in a position 
where they would have to respond to even the slightest blush,'' 
said Underwood. ``Hopefully, the standard is high enough that we 
won't get the frivolous suspensions for holding hands or for 
kissing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Children are children,'' she said. ``They are going to  
misbehave.''

<HEADLINE> Survey Finds More Kids Buckled Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More children are riding buckled up in autos  
than ever before, and Transportation Department officials on Monday 
credited the increase to greater enforcement of seat belt laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of child seats or seat belts by children ages 1 through  
4 jumped to 87 percent in 1998 from 60 percent in 1996, according 
to survey data released by the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Infants from birth to age 1 riding in child seats increased from  
85 percent to 93 percent in the same two-year period, NHTSA said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These numbers provide strong evidence that our increased  
enforcement efforts are paying off,'' said Dr. Ricardo Martinez, 
NHTSA's administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	The data were released as more than 5,700 law enforcement  
agencies across the country begin a weeklong safety awareness 
campaign by ticketing motorists who fail to buckle up children. 
</P>
<P>
	From Monday through the Memorial Day weekend, officers will  
issue citations if children are not restrained in child seats or 
seat belts, said the sponsor of the semiannual crackdown, the Air 
Bag and Seat Belt Safety Campaign. The campaign is working with 
police and government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Intense, visible enforcement works to drive up seat belt  
use,'' said Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater. ``The needle is 
moving up, and moving up dramatically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The child restraint use information was collected in the 1998  
National Occupant Protection Use Survey, a national sampling of 
auto seat belt use done by the agency every two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Child safety seats save the lives each year of 300 children  
under age 5 and seat belts save more than 10,000 lives, NHTSA said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, about one-third of children ages 1 through 4 were using  
seat belts in the back seat instead of riding in car seats or 
booster seats appropriate for their size and weight, as safety 
experts recommend. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey indicated passengers in older age groups also are  
buckling up more, although the increases were not as dramatic: 
</P>
<P>
	--Nearly 69 percent of children ages 5 through 15 were using  
booster seats or seat belts, up from 65 percent in 1996. But 
Martinez said some of those children were being moved into adult 
seat belts too soon. 
</P>
<P>
	--Seat belt use among older teen-agers and young adults, ages 16  
through 24, increased from 50 percent in 1996 to 55 percent in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	--Seat belt use among adults ages 25 through 68 increased from 62  
percent to 67 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Seat belt use among adults age 69 or older increased from 69  
percent to 74 percent.

<HEADLINE> Jazz or Blazers for Spurs? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The Spurs' sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers  
earned San Antonio a rare day off Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	With no practice scheduled, Spurs players rested and waited to  
learn whether they'll face Portland or longtime nemesis Utah in the 
NBA's Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever comes, we don't have much control and we can't do  
anything about it,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ``I don't 
want to play either one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Trail Blazers lead the Jazz 3-1 lead in their semifinal  
series. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio beat the Lakers 118-107 Sunday to win their  
semifinal series 4-0 and advance to a conference final for the 
fifth time in franchise history. The last time was 1995, when the 
eventual NBA champion Houston Rockets beat the Spurs in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio never has won an NBA championship.  
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of cheering fans hungry for a title crowded around a  
private airport terminal to greet the team's charter plane when it 
arrived Sunday night from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been here off and on for seven years. They're so much  
more enthusiastic than they were in '95,'' Spurs point guard Avery 
Johnson said of the airport welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	This is only the second time in David Robinson's 10-year NBA  
career that San Antonio has advanced past the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great,'' Robinson said. ``I like this group. It is  
special. We work all season to put ourselves in this position. ... 
It is not lucky that we got here. We did a nice job playing 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he cautioned, the Spurs have much left to do.  
</P>
<P>
	Tim Duncan, in his second season and succeeding Robinson as the  
Spurs' go-to guy, played brilliantly against the Lakers over the 
weekend. Duncan scored 37 points Saturday in Game 3 and 33 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a huge team effort,'' Duncan said. ``People kept coming  
off the bench and doing things for us that we needed. People just 
stepped into their roles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reserve guard Jaren Jackson scored 20 points Sunday, including  
six 3-pointers, while Malik Rose and Jerome Kersey came off the 
bench to score 8 and 9 points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz have a history of defeating the Spurs in the  
postseason. Utah eliminated San Antonio the last two times they 
met, beating the Spurs 4-2 in the Western Conference semifinals in 
1996 and 4-1 in the same round last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether they face the Jazz or the Trail Blazers next, the Spurs  
can take comfort in knowing they beat Utah once and Portland twice 
in the final four games of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio finished with a 37-13 record, edging Utah to win the  
Midwest Division title and the No. 1 seed throughout the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won every close game down the stretch,'' Robinson said.  
``You just believe in yourself and begin to understand that we can 
win every one of these games.''

<HEADLINE> NH Man Accused of Abducting Ex-Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOWELL, Mass. (AP) -- Authorities on Monday arrested a man  
accused of abducting his ex-wife from her workplace, a shelter for 
women and children in crisis in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested 49-year-old Gary Collinge and found his ex-wife,  
46-year-old Marguerite Eno, apparently unharmed, according to 
Nashua, N.H., police Lt. Wayne MacDonald. He said tips from 
unidentified relatives led police to their location in a Lowell 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Collinge was arrested on a fugitive from justice warrant issued  
in New Hampshire. He put up no resistance when arrested, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Collinge abducted Eno at gunpoint Sunday night from  
Marguerite's Place in Nashua. Nashua Detective Sgt. Frank Paison 
said four shots were fired as she was dragged but were apparently 
not aimed at anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell is about 12 miles south of Nashua.

<HEADLINE> Return of Browns Means Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- From her youngest days growing up in Cleveland,  
Patty J. Flynt knew the appeal of the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father had season tickets and was delighted when his five  
daughters began dating and getting married: that way he knew more 
guys for talking up football and the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew every Monday morning we would be talking about did the  
Browns win or lose,'' said Flynt, 47. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has been without a professional football team since the  
old Browns moved to Baltimore in 1995. But the expansion Browns 
begin play in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt still sees their appeal, this time from a business  
standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	Her company, Columbus-based CoreComm, has a 10-year sponsorship  
deal with the team. The company provides long distance, cellular 
and paging services. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt, who is president of CoreComm, said the deal gives the  
company stadium signs, a suite and bragging rights as the team's 
``exclusive telecommunications sponsor.'' The Browns get a 
``substantial payment,'' although Flynt won't say how much. 
</P>
<P>
	``Connecting ourselves as a company to part of what I believe is  
part of the fabric of the city of Cleveland is very important. They 
are a great tradition,'' said Flynt. 
</P>
<P>
	The CoreComm deal is one of a growing array of ``partnering''  
announcements by the Browns, led by billionaire banker Al Lerner 
and Carmen Policy, the savvy Youngstown native who helped build the 
San Francisco 49ers into a National Football League powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns also have an official engineering services provider  
(Enron Energy Services Inc. of Houston), an exclusive travel 
provider (Allsports Travel of Youngstown), three concessionaires 
(Facility Merchandising Inc. of suburban Los Angeles, Restaurant 
Associates of New York and Sportservice Corp. of Buffalo, N.Y.) and 
an ``official office products/office supplier'' for Cleveland 
Stadium (OfficeMax Inc. of nearby Shaker Heights). 
</P>
<P>
	The business deals even extend to the rowdy Dawg Pound cheering  
section in the bleachers, which will be replicated in the new 
stadium. The Browns have licensed a Dawg Pound logo -- a helmeted 
dog with a football in its mouth -- providing them with sportswear 
profit opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, sports partnerships aren't new: Ford Motor Co. makes  
the ``official vehicles'' of the Cleveland Indians, Southwest 
Airlines is the ``official airline'' of the Cleveland Cavaliers, 
and Sprite is the ``official soft drink'' of the National 
Basketball Association. 
</P>
<P>
	A Cleveland brewer who has tested the appeal of the Browns said  
the team has the hearts of the people and its resurgence presents 
an enormous business opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an enthusiasm and excitement for the return of this  
team to this town that is unparalleled in professional sports, and 
I mean any of them,'' said Chris Livingston, president of Crooked 
River Brewing Co. 
</P>
<P>
	His brewery was a hit with its ``Expansion Draft'' beer released  
in time for the Browns' draft selections. The beer (Livingston 
calls it ``a good, light beer ... a classic American beer'') 
doesn't mention the Browns on the label and wasn't sanctioned by 
the team, but he expects it to generate more than 20 percent of the 
brewery's revenue this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston, who is still talking with the team about getting his  
beer sold at the stadium, dismisses any suggestion that the Browns 
may be overexposing themselves with corporate backers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is just tremendous depth from the marketing standpoint  
that the Cleveland Browns bring to this town and this region,'' he 
said. ``They are smart guys. They are not going to over-leverage 
the franchise.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Target Reno in Spy Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers, including a normally staunch  
Democratic defender of the Clinton White House, say Attorney 
General Janet Reno should resign, or at least consider doing so, 
because of what they call the administration's tepid response to 
alleged nuclear spying by China. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments, made on the Sunday television talk shows, came as  
a special House committee prepares to release a report detailing 
China's quest for American military secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the Justice Department is adrift,'' said Sen.  
Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Intelligence 
Committee. ``I believe that the attorney general ought to resign 
and she ought to take her top lieutenants with her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In response, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said today  
``the president has confidence in the attorney general'' and noted 
that she had directed an internal investigation into the FBI's and 
Justice's handling of the case involving a Los Alamos scientist, 
dating back to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be inappropriate to prejudge that review,'' Lockhart  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, appearing with  
Shelby on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' also said President Clinton 
should talk with Reno about possibly stepping down. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something wrong when the United States Congress on a  
bipartisan basis has so little confidence in the chief law 
enforcement officer of the United States,'' said Torricelli, who 
customarily supports administration policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's time for President Clinton to have a conversation  
with the attorney general about her ability to perform her duties 
and whether or not it is in the national interest for her to 
continue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has long been under fire from GOP lawmakers for her refusal  
to have an independent counsel investigate charges the Chinese 
funneled illegal contributions to Clinton's 1996 presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the issue is the Justice Department's refusal to  
approve FBI requests for a wiretap of Wen Ho Lee, a scientist at 
the Los Alamos, N.M., nuclear weapons laboratory who is suspected 
of passing secrets to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said Reno had reviewed  
the decision and fully supported it. ``The Justice Department 
cannot and must not authorize intrusion by the government into the 
lives of its citizens when the evidence presented as in this case 
fails to meet the standards established by the Constitution and the 
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,'' Marlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a special House panel chaired by Rep. Christopher  
Cox, R-Calif., is to make public its report detailing how Chinese 
stole or otherwise obtained satellite and nuclear secrets over the 
past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox, interviewed on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said the  
revelations in the report ``were so stark, so grave and so 
important,'' and the espionage ``continues to this very day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said satellite and  
radar technology, supercomputers, nuclear warhead designs and 
advanced rocket technology have entered Chinese hands. ``I do agree 
with others that some heads should roll,'' he said on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who was credited by  
Republicans for taking forceful steps in recent months to bolster 
security at the national labs, urged lawmakers not to politicize 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	While Shelby and others declared this could be the worst case of  
espionage in U.S. history, Richardson told on ABC's ``This Week,'' 
that the content and extent of the Chinese spying is still unclear. 
``We cannot overdramatize conclusions that are not conclusive 
yet,'' he said, adding that the United States has 6,000 strategic 
warheads to 23 for the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cox said there were serious lapses in the U.S. response to  
the Los Alamos affair, which was first uncovered in 1995 but didn't 
surface until this year when Lee was fired from his job. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a great deal of time the appropriate people in our  
government were not told of these things,'' Cox said, noting that 
one person out of the loop until this year was the secretary of 
commerce, who is responsible for approving high-tech sales to 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told CBS she also did not  
learn of the investigation until earlier this year. ``I was not 
briefed, that was wrong, and I made that clear and that has been 
rectified,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said he would meet with key Senate committee chairmen today  
to discuss future action, including the possibilities of appointing 
a special investigative committee and passing laws tightening 
export laws and security.

<HEADLINE> US Rules Out '47 Palestine Partition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, poised to work  
with a new government in Israel, today ruled out a 1947 U.N. 
resolution calling for the partition of Palestine into Jewish and 
Arab states as a basis for peacemaking. 
</P>
<P>
	While reminding Israel the United States would insist it  
relinquish land for peace with the Arabs, senior American mediator 
Dennis Ross said the resolution, which has strong Arab and European 
support, ``is not relevant'' to current peacemaking efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not appropriate, and we will say so,'' Ross said,  
prompting applause from delegates to the annual meeting of the 
American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, the main pro-Israel 
lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
	Resolution 181, adopted by the U.N. General Assembly, would  
transfer large parts of what is now Israel to an Arab state, as 
well as all the land that the Arabs subsequently lost to Israel in 
the 1967 Mideast war, 
</P>
<P>
	Saeb Erekat, Yasser Arafat's top negotiator, said in the region  
today that U.N. resolutions 242 and 338 -- calling on Israel to 
concede territory captured in the war in exchange for secure 
borders -- still applies, but ``this should not undermine 181, 
especially in provisions calling for a two-state solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Ross said resolutions 242 and 338, which were approved in  
1967 and 1973 by the U.N. Security Council, were the only bases for 
negotiations. ``Any other basis is not relevant,'' he said, clearly 
referring to resolution 181. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat, Erekat and other officials of the Palestinian Authority  
are viewed by the Clinton administration as bent on peace with 
Israel if they can only take over more territory. 
</P>
<P>
	With Ehud Barak elected as prime minister, and far more inclined  
than his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, to give up land for 
promises of peace, Ross and others in the administration are 
gearing up for a new try. 
</P>
<P>
	In an apparent reference to Netanyahu's government, Ross said  
``accusations'' by either side and ``steps on the ground'' tend to 
hurt the good will needed for agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu's government had accused Arafat of not rooting out  
terrorist cells on land already under Palestinian control, and 
supported settlers who have staked claims to part of the territory 
on which Arafat intends to establish a state. 
</P>
<P>
	Officially, the Clinton administration is neutral on statehood  
and on whether the Palestinians should have part of Jerusalem as a 
capital. But President Clinton, in a speech in Gaza and in a letter 
to Arafat, has offered strong support to what he called 
``Palestinian aspirations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is confident Barak can help advance the Middle  
East peace process, Vice President Al Gore said in a speech Sunday 
night to the lobby group. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore called Barak, who defeated the more hawkish Benjamin  
Netanyahu on Monday, ``an immensely credible voice in support of 
peace.''

<HEADLINE> Conn. Company Trying To Clone Pets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARMINGTON, Conn. (AP) -- Can't live without Fido once Fido's  
gone? Two entrepreneurs may have the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	For $1,000 per pet -- plus a $100 annual storage fee -- Heather  
Bessoff and Ron Gillespie will take a genetic sample from a living 
or dead animal and keep it frozen at their lab. 
</P>
<P>
	They say the DNA can be stored until science figures out a way  
to clone dogs, cats and other lifetime companions who may not stick 
around for an owner's lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	Bessoff is a veterinarian and Gillespie an agricultural  
consultant. So far, PerPETuate Inc. -- run from Bessoff's basement -- 
has signed up six customers since it began in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``There could be people who don't agree with what we're doing.  
We understand that,'' Bessoff said. ``But we feel there are so many 
benefits.''

<HEADLINE> Hog Farmers Now Breaking Even / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLIN, Ind. (AP) -- Hog farmer Jay Hawley isn't exactly  
ecstatic these days, but for the first time in nine months he can 
sell his hogs for about what it costs to raise them. 
</P>
<P>
	After enduring the worst hog price crisis since the Great  
Depression, Hawley and other hog farmers hope prices rise or at 
least remain stable so they can erase debts incurred when the 
market collapsed last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad when you look at break-even as being good,'' Hawley  
said. ``The basic premise is you should make money doing this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Small and midsize family farmers such as Hawley -- who's been  
farming hogs in Clinton County for 30 years -- lost tens of 
thousands of dollars each during the low-price crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Starved for profits, they now need to pay overdue bills,  
replenish bank balances and justify to themselves and their 
families their continued toil at one of farming's dirtiest and 
toughest jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue University economists estimate that the crisis could have  
robbed Indiana farmers of $300 million in net worth when the final 
numbers are tallied up. 
</P>
<P>
	The price plunge struck with a vengeance at the end of last  
summer, knocking farm prices below the break-even range of 35 cents 
to 40 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices tumbled even further in autumn, and in December, they  
dipped under 10 cents a pound -- a record low if inflation is 
factored out. 
</P>
<P>
	Money-losing prices continued to haunt farmers until this month,  
when prices edged back up to the break-even price of 40 cents per 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether slaughter plants will continue paying those prices isn't  
clear. Prices typically shoot up in May because of a temporary lull 
in hog shipments as farmers are busy with spring planting. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting the crops in the ground every spring is critical for a  
hog farmer, especially in these low-price times. Half of the corn 
Hawley raises is fed to his hogs as a cheap, homegrown food source. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2,300 hogs of all ages and sizes -- from squealing piglets  
to 800-pound boars -- spend their lives in the eight-building hog 
complex behind Hawley's house. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many producers, Hawley hasn't actually seen a check from  
his buyers reflecting the price rebound. He sells only one batch of 
hogs a month, and his next 200-head shipment isn't due out until 
Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
	One day last week, Hawley's 72-year-old father, Robert Hawley,  
returned from spraying herbicide on weeds sprouting along the 
farm's fence lines. He came with big news. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guess what I found? A 150-pound pig in the field. Sprayed him  
and kind of woke him up,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The news prompted a search, and before long the escapee is found  
lying in tall grass by a fence, a few hundred feet from the barn. 
Roused by Hawley's dogs, the panting hog gets to its feet, and soon 
climbs willingly into a livestock trailer hauled to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the barn, father and son shoo the hog back inside its  
pen and nail a plank over a gap in a well-worn fence where the hog 
had escaped. 
</P>
<P>
	With hog prices over 40 cents a pound for the first time in a  
long time, every hog counts.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Little Changed As Stocks Fall / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds were little changed Monday as stocks fell  
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dipped 3/32  
point, or 94 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, edged up to 5.76 percent from late 
Friday's 5.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The smooth sailing in bonds came as some investors sought the  
safety of government securities while stock prices were stumbling 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was down 174.61, or by 1.6  
percent, at 10,654.67. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasuries ranged from unchanged to 1/32  
point higher, and intermediate maturities ranged from 1/32 point to 
1/8 point higher, reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 4.61 percent from  
Friday's 4.59 percent, while the discount rose 0.02 percentage 
point to 4.49 percent. Six-month yields were unchanged at 4.75 
percent as the discount held steady at 4.57 percent. One-year 
yields rose to 4.82 percent from late Friday, while the discount 
rose 0.01 percentage point to 4.60 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, remained unchanged at 4.69 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 1/32 point to 122 1/4. The average yield 
to maturity was unchanged at 5.35 percent from late Friday.

<HEADLINE> University Names Don King Trustee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- The university which last year gave boxing  
promoter Don King an honorary doctorate and received a $200,000 
donation has appointed him to its board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	King joined Shaw University's 40-member board earlier this  
month, university spokeswoman Regina Boone said Monday. Also 
joining the board were former North Carolina State chancellor Larry 
Monteith and Garrett Briggs, the former president of Peace College 
in Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	WBA and IBF heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield also is a  
board member. 
</P>
<P>
	Trustees and alumni acknowledged King's controversial past but  
applauded his humanitarian efforts, university president Talbert O. 
Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it weren't for redemption, none of us would have a  
chance,'' Shaw said in a statement. ``King has a good heart, 
believe it or not, and he really wants to help young people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King said in a prepared statement that he was honored by the  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	He was convicted of murder, a charge later reduced to  
manslaughter; faced numerous lawsuits from boxers and their 
handlers; was acquitted on tax evasion charges in 1985; and was 
acquitted last year of insurance fraud in the second of two trials. 
</P>
<P>
	King has been the subject of at least three grand jury  
investigations and at least one FBI sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, King received an honorary doctorate from the  
historically black private college and quipped that he ought to 
donate millions of dollars for a campus arena and fitness center. 
He recently donated $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP honored King in 1997 for his ``significant support of  
social causes.''

<HEADLINE>  New IRL Car Devices To Protect Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indy Racing League is using space-age  
cable in its cars to save lives in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL, following the lead of rival Championship Auto Racing  
Teams and Formula One, said Monday it will have a ``wheel energy 
restraint system'' on its cars for Sunday's Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes almost a month after an accident in  
Concord, N.C., in which debris killed three spectators and injured 
eight others in the grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Mehl, executive director of the IRL and a vice president of  
the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, said the system is designed to 
keep suspension parts from flying off open-wheel cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes will be made before Thursday's two-hour  
``Carburetion Day'' practice. That is the only time between the end 
of qualifications and the start of the 500 that the 33 starters 
will drive on the 2 1/2-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Three spectators also were killed and several others injured  
last July in Brooklyn, Mich., by a wheel and other debris from a 
crash during a CART event. The North Carolina and Michigan tracks 
are high-speed, high-banked ovals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that this is definitely a step in the right  
direction,'' Mehl said. ``We're not done with taking more steps to 
make us more confident on the high banks. We have some more things 
that we will do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``I think we're doing everything possible to make it  
as safe for the fans as it can be. I mean, there isn't a 100 
percent guarantee that we're going to walk out there and not get 
run over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A.J. Foyt, a four-time Indy 500 winner and now an IRL team  
owner, appreciates the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything they can do to make racing safer is fine with me,''  
he said. ``It's like the car makers putting in seat belts and air 
bags. Even if it only works 50 percent of the time, it's great. It 
can save lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eliseo Salazar, who has finished fourth and sixth at Indy and  
will be starting 18th on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's absolutely necessary we try something,'' he said.  
``Nobody can say if this will be 100 percent efficient, but it's 
crucial we never put the spectators in that position again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the three companies building cars for IRL competition --  
Dallara in Italy, G Force in England and Riley &AMP; Scott in 
Indianapolis -- have worked with the league in developing a 
restraint system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, nobody knows more about their race cars than the  
manufacturers themselves,'' Mehl said. 
</P>
<P>
	CART's new system -- which will anchor the front suspensions --  
will make its debut in Saturday's Motorola 300 in Madison, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL announcement said all four suspensions on its cars will  
be attached to the chassis with cables of Zylon -- a high-tech fiber 
Mehl said is two times stronger than Kevlar. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has a breaking strength of five tons,'' said Mehl, who  
added that it's the same material used by Formula One. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pointed out that there is no way to test the  
effectiveness of the new system under the actual stresses except in 
the cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody can test at 200 mph and our cars spend a great deal of  
their racing life over 200.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Formula One began requiring its teams to use tether systems at  
the start of the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	One worry is the possibility that tethered suspension pieces or  
wheels could rebound into the open cockpit, hitting the driver. But 
Mehl said the IRL thinks its system will actually make the drivers 
safer. 
</P>
<P>
	The cables will connect the rear hubs and the front hubs and  
will also be attached to the farthest points from the driver on the 
frame. Mehl said they should not be able to reach the driver's 
compartment in a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	But, even if they could reach the cockpit, most of the drivers  
have said they'd rather be at more risk than put spectators in 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``We live for this, and we know what can happen,'' Salazar said.  
``You never want to put other people in the way of harm.''

<HEADLINE> Insurance Investors Getting Scammed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Jerry Warner first heard the sales pitch  
for investing in life insurance policies of the terminally ill, he 
didn't think it was a morbid arrangement. In fact, he found it 
quite altruistic to help out sick people with an early payoff on 
their policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Warner, a retired plant worker living in Independence, Mo.,  
has fallen victim to what state securities regulators are calling 
one of the hottest new investment scams. 
</P>
<P>
	In the legal practice of viatical investing, investors buy the  
policies through a broker and a portion of the money is paid to the 
policyholder, who often has AIDS or cancer, to help with medical 
bills. The investor is supposed to get paid when the person dies, 
but in some cases, the policyholders aren't really dying. In other 
cases, the policyholders don't exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner and his mother lost a combined $16,000 on their $45,000  
investment made with a viatical company based in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	About two years after investing, Warner says, they suddenly  
received settlement checks for some $29,000. The company told them 
the policyholders were living longer than anticipated and their 
insurance premiums had to be paid -- an issue Warner said had never 
been raised before. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here we end up stuck with the lack of someone else's  
responsibility,'' Warner said Monday in a telephone interview. He's 
not convinced the ill policyholders ever really existed. 
</P>
<P>
	State securities regulators added viatical investment scams to  
their annual list of the ``top ten'' investment frauds, issued 
Monday. Also added were high-priced seminars in ``day trading,'' in 
which inexperienced investors are convinced they can get rich quick 
by rapid-fire buying and selling of stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we have an ideal climate for fraud,'' said Peter  
Hildreth, president of the North American Securities Administrators 
Association, who also is New Hampshire's director of securities 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Millions of new investors, many of whom expect unrealistically  
high returns, are looking for places to put their money.'' Hildreth 
said. ``At the same time, we're living through an Internet-driven 
technology revolution that is a boon to investors and con artists 
alike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investing in insurance policies of the terminally ill has been  
around for about a decade. Viatical investing takes its name from 
the Latin ``viaticum'' -- a purse given to a traveler in preparation 
for a journey. 
</P>
<P>
	Viatical companies arrange for the sales of the policies and  
take a share of the proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	As an example, a group of investors may pay a terminally ill  
person $80,000 for the person's $100,000 life insurance policy. 
When the person dies, the group will make a $20,000 profit, minus 
premiums and fees to the viatical broker. 
</P>
<P>
	While many brokers operate legally, the practice isn't  
regulated, which ``creates a situation that could be ripe for 
fraud,'' said Scott Lane, assistant enforcement director of 
Pennsylvania's Securities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Gloria Wolk, an expert cited by Lane, estimates that investors  
have lost more than $400 million in viatical investments since the 
industry sprouted in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators have taken enforcement actions against several  
viatical companies. 
</P>
<P>
	One problem occurs when people who aren't really sick take out  
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, Lane said, people can get life insurance policies  
worth as much as $100,000 without medical exams or blood tests. 
</P>
<P>
	In other cases, the viatical company promises big returns of 25  
percent or more to investors, but doesn't have any insurance 
policies to back them up. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when someone is terminally ill, the state regulators  
caution, viatical investing is risky because of the uncertainty in 
predicting when the person will die. New AIDS drugs have compounded 
the risk for investors because they keep people with the disease 
alive longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Rhoades, a vice president of the National Viatical  
Association, said fraud is not widespread in the $1 billion-a-year 
industry. She said it has occurred in a few instances, as happens 
``in any other industry that is unregulated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe it should be regulated,'' Ms. Rhoades said, noting  
that the trade group has been working to that end with the National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners.

<HEADLINE>  Cipollini Wins Italy Tour Stage 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANSEPOLCRO, Italy (AP) -- Mario Cipollini outsprinted a large  
pack of riders Monday to win the 10th stage of the Tour of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his second stage win of the Tour and the 27th of his  
career. 
</P>
<P>
	France's Laurent Jalabert finished in the main group, right  
behind Cipollini, and retained the overall lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Marco Pantani finished close to Jalabert, and  
remained virtually tied for the overall lead. Jalabert leads by the 
.02 seconds he gained in winning Sunday's time trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Cipollini, who also won the second stage, pulled away from the  
lead group over the closing 100 yards and finished in 4 hours, 28 
minutes, 24 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you do not win for a while, they think you're finished.  
Well, I'm still here,'' Cipollini said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Italians, Ivan Quaranta and Massimo Strazzer, were  
second and third, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowded finish was set up when the main group caught three  
riders who had broken away early in the 118-mile route from Ancona 
west into Tuscany. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's 11th stage of 78 miles takes the riders east to  
Cesenatico on the Adriatic coast. It is the shortest of the race's 
22 stages, except for the two time trials.

	Cipollini, who also won the second stage, pulled away from the  
lead group over the closing 100 yards and finished in 4 hours, 28 
minutes, 24 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you do not win for a while, they think you're finished.  
Well, I'm still here,'' Cipollini said.

<P>
	Two other Italians, Ivan Quaranta and Massimo Strazzer, were  
second and third, respectively.

<P>
	Tuesday's 11th stage of 78 miles takes the riders east to  
Cesenatico on the Adriatic coast. It is the shortest of the race's 
22 stages, except for the two time trials.

<HEADLINE> Rogers &AMP; Wells, UK Law Firm to Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The leaders of the New York-based law firm  
Rogers &AMP; Wells have decided to merge with one of Britain's biggest 
and most prestigious firms, Clifford Chance. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive committees of the two firms voted separately late  
Friday to submit proposals for a merger to their partners, a senior 
attorney at one of the firms said today. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved by the full partnerships it would be the first  
merger of major U.S. and British law firms. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Rogers &AMP; Wells, Jolie Goldstein, declined to  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The senior attorney, who would speak only on condition of  
anonymity, said, ``There are some conflicts that need to be 
resolved before we can make any kind of announcement. The executive 
committees of the two firms have voted to submit proposals to merge 
to the partners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If completed, the merger is expected to spark similar unions  
between firms in the two countries amid a trend of consolidation in 
the increasingly international field of law. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would create a combined firm to be known in the United  
States as Clifford Chance Rogers &AMP; Wells and simply as Clifford 
Chance elsewhere, and would take effect Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifford Chance has 2,000 lawyers and a large international  
network of offices. The 400 attorneys at Rogers &AMP; Wells would give 
it a strong U.S. base.

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Blamed in Michigan Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CRYSTAL TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- A couple and four boys sleeping  
over as guests of their son were killed in a fast-moving fire 
blamed on a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old son, Christopher Simmons, escaped early Sunday  
and ran to a neighbor's house for help. When firefighters arrived, 
the house in the community 40 miles northeast of Grand Rapids was 
engulfed in flames, Fire Chief Bob Brundage said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state fire marshal's office ruled today that the fire was  
accidental and likely started when a cigarette fell into a couch on 
the porch. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the boy smelled the smoke and heard a smoke  
alarm, but the smoke was too thick for him to reach his friends or 
family. He made a vain effort to put out the flames with a garden 
hose before going for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonnie Woodruff, who lives next door, said she and her husband  
were awakened when their dog barked after Simmons knocked on their 
door. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just said, `Help me, help me, the house is on fire,''' she  
said. ``He was in shock, screaming and crying. He had to sit here 
and watch.'' She said he told her he accidentally started the fire 
with a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
	All six victims apparently died of smoke inhalation, Brundage  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons' mother, Linda Christophersen, 42, and his stepfather,  
Richard Christophersen, 35, were killed. Also killed were Simmons' 
friends Lee Geselman, 16, Blakely Sailor, 17, and twin 15-year-old 
brothers, Matthew and Stephen Long. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons was treated for burns at a hospital and released.

<HEADLINE> Rosie Nixes Annie 'Gun' Song </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rosie O'Donnell reportedly asked the cast of  
Broadway's ``Annie Get Your Gun'' to change a lyric in one of the 
show's hit songs before taping her talk show because it clashed 
with her views on guns. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell wanted the line ``I can shoot a partridge with a  
single cartridge'' removed from one of the show's hit songs, 
``Anything You Can Do,'' the New York Post reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post said the musical's stars, led by star Bernadette  
Peters, refused the request and shot down a planned taping of ``The 
Rosie O'Donnell Show,'' set for Tuesday. The show is a revival of 
the classic Irving Berlin musical about Wild West sharpshooter 
Annie Oakley. 
</P>
<P>
	The appearance was revived when co-star Tom Wopat and other cast  
members agreed to perform ``My Defenses Are Down,'' a song from the 
musical that does not mention guns. The Post said Peters will not 
appear. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell spokeswoman Lois Smith said the song was changed  
because Peters could not attend the taping. ``Anything You Can Do'' 
is a duet; ``My Defenses Are Down'' is sung by Wopat. 
</P>
<P>
	The report follows last week's heated on-air debate between  
O'Donnell and actor Tom Selleck. The actor has taped a commercial 
for the National Rifle Association, while O'Donnell has been a 
frequent critic of the NRA since the Columbine High School 
massacre.

<HEADLINE> Torre Mulls Yankee Lineup Switches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Joe Torre fills out the lineup card at  
Yankee Stadium for the first time in more than seven months, there 
probably will be a few changes. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Yankees game against the Boston Red Sox was rained out  
Monday night, Torre said it might be time to shake up New York's 
struggling lineup a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could do it tomorrow,'' said Torre, who missed the first six  
weeks of the season recovering from prostate cancer surgery. ``But 
before I do anything involving the middle of the lineup, the guys 
will hear from me. I won't just post it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of those struggling Yankees -- Tino Martinez and Paul O'Neill  
-- did talk with Torre before leaving the ballpark Monday. They went 
into Torre's office for separate meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, the Yankees most consistent hitter since coming to New  
York in 1993, is batting .195 with no homers and four RBIs this 
month and the frustration is evident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been through a stretch like this since coming to  
New York,'' O'Neill said. ``I told him it wouldn't bother me. We're 
not scoring runs. I am coming up in big at-bats and not delivering. 
We'll see if a change helps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre acknowledged that any changes would probably be minor. And  
even if he skakes up the lineup a little Tuesday, it could change 
back by next week. All he's looking for is a little spark to get 
this team going again. 
</P>
<P>
	New York has lost eight of its last 12 and trails Boston by 1 1/2  
games in the AL East. That's not cause for panic, but it does raise 
concerns -- especially on a team that rolled through last year with 
114 wins and barely even a hint of a slump. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul is fighting something awful right now,'' Torre said. ``It  
makes it much tougher when you are losing games because you start 
blaming yourself. Last year, whenever someone went in a slump other 
people picked it up and the team still won so it was easier to 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``No club is as good as what we did last year,'' Torre said.  
``We played above our heads and got the breaks. We are better than 
we are playing right now. We're probably somewhere in between.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre is hoping the dramatic come-from-behind win Sunday against  
the Chicago White Sox will start a hot streak for New York. The 
Yankees trailed 7-3 in the ninth before tying the game on a balk 
and winning it in the 10th on Chad Curtis' homer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully it is the start of not being hesitant, not being  
tentative and not being all the things we're not used to being,'' 
Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees' struggles run much deeper than O'Neill. Scott  
Brosius is batting .167 (7-for-42) with no RBIs in his last 13 
games; the Yankees have gotten almost no production from a left 
field platoon of Curtis, Shane Spencer and Ricky Ledee or the 
catching tandem of Jorge Posada and Joe Girardi; and leadoff hitter 
Chuck Knoblauch is hitting .136 this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``This game is a game of numbers, wins, losses and average.  
Period,'' O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	And because the Yankees numbers have not been up to  
expectations, Torre appears ready to make a change.. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The game will be made up Thursday at 7:05 p.m. EDT. ... The  
pitching matchups for the series will stay the same: Brian Rose 
(1-0) vs. Hideki Irabu (1-2) on Tuesday; Mark Portugal (3-2) vs. 
Orlando Hernandez (4-4) on Wednesday; and Pat Rapp (2-2) vs. Roger 
Clemens (3-0) on Thursday. ... Yankees minor league catcher Jaime 
Torres began three days of radiation Monday as part of his planned 
treatment for thyroid cancer. ... The Red Sox have won 14 of their 
last 17 games.

<HEADLINE> Japan Banks Have $171B in Bad Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's 17 biggest banks are saddled with a total  
of $171.7 billion in bad debts under newly introduced accounting 
standards, a leading Japanese economic newspaper said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined problem loans were up $9.84 billion from the  
previously disclosed amount under the old accounting method, the 
Nihon Keizai daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's banks have been struggling to deal with loans which have  
soured amid the nation's worst recession in 50 years. Many of these 
loans were extended in the late 1980s to finance highly speculative 
land deals before a burst in real estate prices at the outset of 
this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators in Japan revamped disclosure standards last year for  
domestic banks as part of a scheme implemented in October to inject 
new capital into banks to cover bad loan write-offs. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new disclosure standards, applied for last fiscal year  
ended March 31, problem loans include those extended to bankrupt 
borrowers, companies in danger of failing and loan guarantees or 
loaned securities which have gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
	The average ratio of bad debt to total outstanding credit,  
including debt guarantees, was 5.9 percent among the 17 banks, the 
report said. Nippon Trust Bank Ltd. had a 23.6 percent ratio, the 
highest among them. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-ranked Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., the only major commercial  
bank which did not receive public funds in a taxpayer-financed bank 
industry bailout, had a 4.6 percent ratio of bad debt to its total 
lending, the Nihon Keizai said. 
</P>
<P>
	Total write-offs at the 17 major Japanese banks amounted to  
$88.52 billion at the end of March 31, the report said. All but 
Daiwa Bank Ltd. have recently announced their earnings results, and 
all have reported losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said write-offs of bad debt held by Daiwa Bank, which  
is to announce its earnings on Thursday, were calculated based on 
the bank's previously announced restructuring plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Four banks, which had become insolvent due largely to problem  
loans, have been put under state control since late last year.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jennifer Lopez has already played a singing  
sensation in the movies. Now she hopes to be one. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Selena'' actress releases her first album, ``On the 6,''  
on June 1. She sings in English and says the sound is ``Latin 
soul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``English is my first language. I grew up here. I was born here.  
I didn't have a career in Spanish first,'' Ms. Lopez says. ``I 
think it appeals definitely to my generation of people, who grew up 
in America but had Latin parents or parents of a different 
ethnicity.''

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' Burton Faces Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Miami Dolphins tackle Shane Burton  
was charged with drunken driving after going the wrong way down a 
state highway, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, 25, was driving his Lexus east in the westbound lanes of  
State Road 84 around 6:30 a.m. on May 9, according to a Florida 
Highway Patrol arrest report. The car's emergency flashers were on. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton's blood alcohol level was .106, according to the report.  
The legal limit in Florida is .08. 
</P>
<P>
	Trooper Lisa Drake wrote in her arrest report that Burton reeked  
of alcohol, his eyes were bloodshot and he slurred his speech. When 
asked to do five voluntary sobriety exercises, Burton did them, but 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men and two women were in the car with Burton.  
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4, 300-pound Burton played in 15 games last year,  
finishing with 23 tackles, two sacks and one fumble recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	He was drafted by the Dolphins in the fifth round in 1996 out of  
Tennessee. In 1995, Tennessee coach Phil Fulmer suspended Burton 
indefinitely after he was arrested for public drunkenness, 
disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins officials could not be reached for comment Monday  
night.

<HEADLINE>  Macedonia Accepts Flood of Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- Thousands more Kosovo Albanians entered  
Macedonia today in what U.N. officials said may be a ``last push'' 
by Serb forces to expel them, while Macedonia showed more signs of 
trying to resist the refugee influx. 
</P>
<P>
	Many refugees were forced to spend the night at the border,  
sleeping under plastic sheeting, while the U.N. refugee agency 
persuaded Macedonian officials to allow them in. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's arrivals were expected to push the refugee total since  
Friday to more than 20,000. One U.N. official said the increase was 
clear evidence of efforts to clear out the last ethnic Albanian 
residents, especially around Kosovo's capital, Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could call it the last push,'' said Astrid Van Genderen  
Stort, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
``We don't know for certain how many people are left in Kosovo, but 
we've seen a massive influx.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About a quarter-million refugees, almost all of them ethnic  
Albanians, have fled into Macedonia since NATO airstrikes began 
March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with the largest influx of refugees in weeks, Macedonian  
officials were only letting in the ethnic Albanians if they signed 
an agreement to go to Albania, some refugees said. Macedonia is 
worried about the delicate ethnic balance in the Balkan country of 
2.1 million, where ethnic Albanians comprise roughly a third of the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
	``We object strenuously to this procedure,'' said Van Genderen  
Stort. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Sunday, the Macedonians tried to transfer some Kosovo  
Albanians to refugee camps in Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonian officials had loaded at least three buses with about  
200 refugees each for the trip to Albania, 50 miles to the 
southwest, when workers with the U.N. refugee agency blocked one 
bus with a U.N. sedan. The other two buses then also halted. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 3,000 to 4,000 refugees stood or sat in driving rain in  
the area between the border crossings of Macedonia and Yugoslavia, 
where they were forced to spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. envoy Dennis McNamara, speaking with Macedonian officials  
at the border, arranged an end to the standoff. By 3 a.m., the 
buses had entered the country and driven to a refugee camp near the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	The last of the remaining 3,000 refugees arrived after dawn,  
looking exhausted and numb. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, McNamara complained that the Macedonians were acting in  
violation of an agreement allowing refugees to enter the country 
and remain unless they asked to be taken somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very displeased,'' he fumed to reporters after UNHCR  
discovered the apparent attempt to hustle the refugees to Albania 
in the dead of night. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no official comment from the Macedonian government.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, government leaders told U.N. Secretary-General Kofi  
Annan that they would continue to allow Kosovo Albanians to seek 
refuge in the country and that there was space for about 20,000 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	But McNamara said it was the third time he had rushed to the  
border ``in the middle of the night'' to prevent the Macedonians 
from transporting Kosovo Albanians out of the country. He not say 
when the other two times were. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the new arrivals came from Pristina or Urosevac, a city  
in southern Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Kadri Krasniqi, 42, said he and his wife and four children,  
along with other relatives, arrived at the border by train Sunday 
afternoon, but were not allowed to cross into Macedonia until 7 
a.m. today. They had moved in with relatives in Pristina after 
their village in the northern Podujevo area was burned a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking exhausted and smoking a cigarette, he said they had fled  
with only the clothes on their backs after Serb soldiers banged on 
doors Sunday and gave them half an hour to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would go to Albania if it meant going with my entire  
family,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Climbers Bodies Removed in Oregon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The bodies of two climbers killed after a  
1,000-foot fall down Mount Hood were taken off the mountain by 
toboggan Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said one of the two climbers, Carey Cardon, 31, and  
his wife, Tena Cardon, 29, slipped and pulled the other down Sunday 
night as they descended. The fall was witnessed by dozens of 
climbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Unusually warm weather may have led to their deaths. Soft snow  
apparently gave way on their descent. Their bodies were found still 
tethered together. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Multimedia City Ready Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Malaysia's high-tech multimedia  
city modeled after Silicon Valley is set to open a year ahead of 
schedule, despite economic and political turmoil in the Southeast 
Asian nation, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed is expected to declare the  
multibillion dollar cybercity, known as Cyberjaya, officially open 
on July 8. 
</P>
<P>
	A pet project of Mahathir's, Cyberjaya is part of the country's  
Multimedia Super Corridor. The zone, roughly the size of 
neighboring Singapore, will be bound by fiber-optic wires linking 
new megaprojects with the international airport and a new federal 
capital called Putrajaya, where Mahathir will shift offices in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a full-blown recession, Mahathir has funneled extra  
money into the MSC, hailing it as Malaysia's stepping stone to 
developed-nation status by 2020. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our ticket to the next phase of economic development. It  
is a must,'' said Mohamed Arif Nun, executive director and CEO of 
Multimedia Development Corp., the company in charge of the MSC. 
</P>
<P>
	The smart city, estimated to exceed $5.3 billion in costs over  
the next decade, envisages high-tech offices, homes and shopping 
centers and the capacity to hold 240,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 216 companies approved to be part of the MSC, however,  
only 18 have opted to set up shop in Cyberjaya, an hour's drive 
from Kuala Lumpur. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysia's economic crisis and its political turmoil sparked by  
the imprisonment of former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim have 
stirred fears that major international companies would shun the 
Super Corridor, opting for similar projects in Singapore and Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohamed Arif dismissed the talk, saying foreign investors were  
more concerned with dollar sense than political upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the world community, changes in the politics and actions  
countries take to survive -- they see this as beneficial 
activities,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign companies investing in the MSC include Ericsson,  
Motorola Inc., Nokia Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Software giant Microsoft Corp. had initially pledged to back the  
project but plans for its involvement have not evolved. Microsoft 
has also expressed concerns about Malaysia's software piracy laws, 
saying they weren't tough enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the Super Corridor is up and running, the government plans  
to develop other smart cities around the nation, Mohamed Arif said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is only the first in a series of intelligent cities in  
Malaysia,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Brantley To Have Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The strange story of Jeff Brantley took  
another turn Monday when the Philadelphia Phillies closer admitted 
he needs shoulder surgery after all and is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Brantley, who tried to ignore the advice of two doctors who  
recommended season-ending surgery, will have his torn labrum 
repaired Wednesday by Dr. Craig Morgan in Wilmington, Del. He won't 
be able to throw a baseball for at least four months, leaving the 
Phillies with no proven closer. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is to come back and be ready for spring training  
next year,'' Brantley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brantley, who had shoulder surgery in 1997, converted his first  
four save chances this season before sitting out 11 days with a 
sore shoulder. He got his fifth save April 27, but went on the 
disabled list two days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan and Phillies doctor Phillip Marone diagnosed a tear and  
recommended surgery. Instead, Brantley visited renowned orthopedics 
specialist Dr. James Andrews in Birmingham, Ala., on May 3. He 
received a cortisone shot and returned from the disabled list after 
two weeks' rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The shoulder held up until Brantley gave up four runs in the  
ninth inning and blew his first save last Thursday in Montreal. He 
pitched a scoreless inning against the Mets on Saturday but went 
back to the DL Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brantley revealed that Andrews never told him his shoulder might  
not be torn -- as he first told reporters following the visit. 
Essentially, it was Brantley's decision get the cortisone shot and 
try to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know, but I thought that the tear was there,''  
Brantley said. ``I saw the MRI. The thing about it was, I thought 
there was a chance that I could pitch. I was hoping that the 
cortisone would hold the inflammation down for an extended period 
of time. That just didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies recalled right-hander Steve Montgomery from  
Triple-A Scranton-Wilkes Barre. Wayne Gomes, a 26-year-old 
right-hander, is the likely candidate to replace Brantley as 
closer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has the tools to do it, I don't think that's a  
problem,'' Brantley said. ``Hopefully, I can get him over the hump 
and make him understand that there's a lot more to it than just 
going out there, rearing back and firing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies acquired Brantley, Ron Gant and right-hander Cliff  
Politte from St. Louis last winter for pitchers Ricky Bottalico and 
Garrett Stephenson. The Cardinals are paying $1 million of 
Brantley's $2.8 million salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Brantley continues to maintain that he pitched much of last  
season for St. Louis with a torn labrum, but was never given an 
MRI. He knew he may have been risking his career by trying to do so 
this season, but thought it was worth it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what that risk actually is,'' Brantley said.  
``But I'm not a real worrier about risk anyway. I guess if you're a 
closer and you live dangerously in the ninth, you don't worry about 
that part too much.''

<HEADLINE> N.J. Welcomes Bruce Springsteen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey greeted native son Bruce  
Springsteen with open arms and wallets over the weekend, though The 
Boss didn't play a note. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans snatched up 308,000 tickets for Springsteen's 15-night  
stand at the Continental Airlines Arena, from July 16 to Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen, teamed up with the E Street Band for the first time  
in more than a decade, was expected to be one of the summer's 
hottest concert tickets. Ten shows were added Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The first 10 shows -- more than 200,000 tickets -- sold out in  
just five hours. Fans flooded phone lines at the rate of 15,000 per 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll bet he could have done even more dates,'' said Bob  
Castronovo, senior executive vice president at the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-night stand in a single arena set an industry record;  
Springsteen broke his own mark of 11 shows from 1992, Castronovo 
said.

	HOUSTON (AP) -- Colorado second baseman Mike Lansing was placed  
on the 15-day disabled list Monday with a strained left groin. 
</P>
<P>
	Lansing is hitting .310 with 15 RBIs this season. His  
replacement, Lenny Harris, went 2-for-3 at the plate against 
Houston on Monday night but tied a franchise record by making three 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctor gave me some medication to take and in two or three  
days we'll see where we are and go from there,'' Lansing said. 
``It's frustrating because I want to play, but if I can't it's best 
for the team that we get somebody here.''

<HEADLINE> Sabres' Hasek's Status Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Dominik Hasek wasn't talking Monday about the  
injury that has sidelined him in the Stanley Cup playoffs, but that 
was because he was out of town getting tested. 
</P>
<P>
	And so the mystery swirling around the Buffalo Sabres'  
magnificent goalie continued as the team prepared for Game 2 of the 
Eastern Conference finals against the Toronto Maple Leafs Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Will he or won't he play? Only the Dominator could answer that.  
His coach couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to do everything we can,'' Lindy Ruff said after  
practice Monday at Air Canada Centre. ``Our whole focus is on the 
series and getting him back. We're trying to find a way to get him 
to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, bothered by a relapse of a chronic groin problem he's had  
since February, had a bone scan and MRI Sunday night in Buffalo 
after the Sabres beat Toronto 5-4 in Game 1. Journeyman goalie 
Dwayne Roloson, who grew up in nearby Simcoe, Ontario, made 28 
saves in the first playoff start of his unremarkable career to help 
the Sabres steal home-ice advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third straight series the Leafs had opened with a  
loss at home, and that, not Hasek, was on their collective minds. 
They rebounded to eliminate Philadelphia and Pittsburgh in the 
first two rounds, and now they have to repeat that magic again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that we're behind the 8-ball,'' Toronto coach Pat  
Quinn said. ``We also know that we haven't been down two games (in 
a series), and it's not an inviting proposition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to spot 'em one,'' said Leafs goalie Curtis  
Joseph, who was victimized for five goals on 21 shots by the 
opportunistic Sabres. ``Not that we did, they played well. But in 
our minds you don't want to test fate too often. We've gone down 
three series in a row here. Let's hope history repeats itself and 
we're able to come back. It's just one game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Sabres took some bad penalties and allowed three  
power-play goals, they scored three times off turnovers by the 
generous Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine goals and free-wheeling action were something of an  
aberration for the playoffs, which normally are tight-checking, 
low-scoring games. Both teams expected Game 2 to revert to form. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it'll be as run-and-gun as the first game,''  
Toronto wing Garry Valk said. ``I can't see it being as 
high-scoring. We've just got to come back harder, backcheck harder 
and play better in our end. 
</P>
<P>
	``We generated enough chances to win that game. For us, it was  
more defense lapses. Whenever you score four goals in the playoffs, 
that should be enough to win. We had chances to score seven or 
eight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But they didn't, because of Roloson's steady play and some good  
fortune. Roloson poke-checked the puck off Sergei Berezin's stick 
on a dangerous breakaway, stopped a rising backhander by Mats 
Sundin from in close, and watched Lonny Bohonos take a perfect feed 
in front of the goal by Sundin and clang his shot hard off the left 
goalpost with the Leafs trailing 4-3 midway through the third 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roloson played well,'' Valk said. ``He had a lot of pressure  
on him with Hasek out and he came through for them. You can't 
forget what he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Ruff hinted there was a possibility his all-star goalie  
could return for Tuesday night's game, just the mention of it 
seemed more like he was playing a mind game than envisioning Hasek 
in goal for a real game. 
</P>
<P>
	Roloson shrugged it all off.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody knows what's going on,'' said Roloson, who was signed  
by the Sabres as a free agent last summer after playing in Calgary 
for parts of two seasons. ``I'll make sure I'm ready ...''

satisfactorily fulfilled, it could lead to a major contract for 
further work in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract was signed by Slavneft's president, Vasily Duma,

<HEADLINE> IRL Indy 500 Field Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Arie Luyendyk will have the best seat in the  
house for the start of his last ride in the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
	The 45-year-old Flying Dutchman, a two-time winner who already  
holds virtually every speed record at the Brickyard, is retiring 
after Sunday's race. Fittingly, he will start from the pole 
position, on the inside of the front row. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ecstatic about being on the pole, but I would have been  
very satisfied with being on the front row,'' Luyendyk said. ``Even 
before qualifying, I did think that we were going to be competitive 
in the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Ray had the fastest speeds most of last week in practice  
and was a favorite to win the pole. Luyendyk turned a four-lap 
average of 225.179 mph on Saturday, then waited to see if Ray, or 
anyone, could oust him from the pole. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over an hour later, Ray came close at 225.073, but when  
Pole Day was over, Luyendyk was still at the top of the lineup. 
Five other drivers were bumped by faster qualifiers on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The track will be closed until race day, except for a final  
two-hour practice session on Thursday, known as Carburetion Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a lot more nervous watching him than driving the race  
car myself, I can tell you that,'' Luyendyk said of the late 
challenge by Ray, who will start from the middle of the front row. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before my qualifying run, I pretty much had run through my  
qualifying, what I was going to do, how I was going to take the 
turns, what line to go, so I was pretty calm about my own run,'' 
Luyendyk said. ``But when I saw him run, I was really nervous 
because he was my main competitor. It was very close. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we're here to win, so I'm glad he came up short.''  
</P>
<P>
	It will be the third start from the pole for Luyendyk, who also  
is the Indy career money leader with $5.2 million from his first 14 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thrill is the same,'' he said of winning the pole again.  
``I would say this was, maybe at this stage of my career, more of a 
thrill just because of the way the fans reacted coming on down back 
into the pits, and people waving in the pits and thumbs up and 
things like that. ... So it was a very special moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A tentative lineup of 33 cars -- a record for first-day  
qualifiers -- was set on Saturday, putting hard-luck Billy Boat on 
the outside of the front row, a rushed Tony Stewart far back in the 
pack in Row 8, and a nervous Lyn St. James on the bubble with the 
slowest speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipating she would be bumped from the lineup by a faster  
qualifier, St. James took a backup car out to practice Sunday 
morning but blew an engine and slid into the wall in the fourth 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
	She wasn't hurt, but it didn't matter. When Raul Boesel  
qualified on Sunday, St. James became the first of the five drivers 
bumped from the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Unser then bumped rookie Jaques Lazier, younger brother  
of former winner Buddy Lazier; Jack Miller knocked Stephan Gregoire 
out of the starting field, Mike Groff bumped Scott Harrington, and 
Robbie Buhl, who took over an A.J. Foyt backup after his own car 
blew an engine, bumped Groff. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we took the car back and started busting it apart, we  
figured, `This isn't gonna work,''' Buhl said. ``Somebody talked to 
A.J., so I went to see him. ... A.J. was kind enough to say, `Hey, 
I've got two (backup) cars. See which one works best for you.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our two teams pulled together and made a couple calls that  
were right. I think we timed it just right,'' Buhl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes after Buhl qualified, the track was closed by rain,  
leaving rookie Wim Eyckmans of Belgium, driving for owner-teammate 
Eddie Cheever, as the slowest in the field at 220.092 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Boat, who crashed three times in the past week -- including once  
on a warmup lap before qualifications Saturday -- earned his 
front-row start with an average of 223.469 mph. Robby Gordon, who 
took over a Team Menard backup car at almost the last minute, 
qualified on the inside of the second row at 223.066, next to Mark 
Dismore and Scott Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk's Treadway Racing teammate, Sam Schmidt, is on the  
inside of the third row, next to Kenny Brack and Scott Goodyear. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever, the defending Indy winner, will start from the inside  
of the sixth row. Buddy Lazier, the only other former winner 
besides Luyendyk and Cheever, will be on the inside of Row 8, next 
to Roberto Moreno and Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, one of the fastest in practice last week, had to rush  
through qualifications in order to get to Concord, N.C., in time 
for practice for Saturday night's Winston Open, an all-star NASCAR 
race. He'll also leave right after Sunday's race to compete in the 
Coca-Cola 600 at Concord that night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to go quicker, obviously, but we were flat-out the  
whole way around. That's all the car had,'' Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	His 220.653 mph run was some 6 mph slower than his top speed in  
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The field average is 221.558, up from last year's 218.305 but  
well below the record 227.807 set in 1996, before the Indy Racing 
League adopted its current engine and chassis formula.

<HEADLINE> Sonia Gandhi To Rescind Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Sonia Gandhi withdrew her resignation as  
president of India's Congress Party today, ending a leadership 
crisis in the main opposition ahead of fall elections, party 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi agreed to preside over a meeting Tuesday of 1,200  
Congress party representatives from across the country, senior 
party leader ' Mukherjee said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has reconsidered her decision and agreed to continue as  
Congress president,'' Mukherjee said after a meeting of the 
Congress Working Committee, the party's highest decision-making 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	As word reached hundreds of party members waiting outside the  
Congress Party headquarters, people hugged each other in joy. 
Slogans hailing Mrs. Gandhi echoed across the avenue, not far from 
her residence. 
</P>
<P>
	A meeting of the All India Congress Committee was called in New  
Delhi to plead with Mrs. Gandhi to rescind her resignation as 
president of India's oldest political group. But Mrs. Gandhi acted 
before the meeting in response to a plea from the working 
committee, Mukherjee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi resigned last week after three top party officials  
asked her to step down from the prime minister's race because her 
Italian ancestry was turning into an election issue and many 
Indians resented the thought of a foreign-born citizen running for 
the highest elected office. 
</P>
<P>
	They also said she lacks political experience -- unlike her slain  
husband, Rajiv Gandhi; her mother-in-law, Indira Gandhi; or her 
mother-in-law's father, Jawaharlal Nehru, who served as lawmakers 
before they became prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	After Mrs. Gandhi resigned, hundreds of party workers besieged  
her fortress-like house in New Delhi for days to pressure her to 
reconsider. Four chief ministers offered to quit their jobs; dozens 
of officials quit their party posts; supporters threatened to 
immolate themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The three top officials who criticized her were thrown out of  
the party without discussion on the issues they had raised. Their 
expulsion could hurt the prospects of the Congress in the September 
general elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials include Sharad Pawar, formerly the Congress  
powerhouse in the western state of Maharashtra, whose capital, 
Bombay, is the country's financial capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Pawar and the other two -- former house speaker Purno Sangma and  
lawmaker Tariq Anwar -- plan to form another party that will focus 
on issues such as women's empowerment and reduction of poverty.

<HEADLINE> Coyotes Fire Coach Schoenfeld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Good defense, always the trademark of  
Jim Schoenfeld as a player and coach, wasn't enough to get him a 
third year with the Phoenix Coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bobby Smith fired Schoenfeld on Monday, citing  
the team's ineffective power play and lack of scoring punch, both 
of which contributed to the Coyotes' eighth consecutive first-round 
playoff exit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be a better team offensively,'' Smith said. ``Our  
power play was at the very bottom of the NHL (actually 26th), and 
only San Jose, among playoff teams, scored fewer goals. We have to 
change the style of hockey that we play and make it more suited to 
the style of personnel we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he would begin looking for a replacement immediately.  
</P>
<P>
	Always a stronger Schoenfeld backer than owner Richard Burke,  
Smith denied that Burke pressured him to make the move and added 
that nothing about the process shook his faith in the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I'll be in the America West Arena this fall,'' Smith  
said when asked about his future. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant coach John Tortorella has asked for permission to  
interview for a job with Los Angeles, and Smith said he would grant 
that but also would try to persuade Tortorella to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he expects Gordie Roberts, the team's player development  
coach, to be back. Roberts is scheduled to take a group of 10 
Phoenix prospects, including blossoming star Daniel Briere, to 
Finland this summer for two weeks of workouts with the Jokerit 
club. 
</P>
<P>
	Schoenfeld, hired from the Washington Capitals to instill  
discipline and toughness in a team that no one feared, did well 
during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997-98 club was 35-35-12 despite a long list of injuries.  
This season's team scored 90 points, second most in franchise 
history (39-31-12); had the second-best home record (23-13-5); and 
allowed 197 goals, also second-best for a team that entered the 
league in 1979 as the Winnipeg Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes were 14-2-2 in their first 18 games, and held their  
opponents to two goals or fewer in the last 17 of the stretch. It 
was the third-longest streak of its kind in hockey's 55-year modern 
era. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schoenfeld was done in by his inability to get the team past  
the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes opened 2-1 lead on Detroit a year ago, but lost  
their last three. This year, they had a 3-1 lead on St. Louis and 
again finished with a three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he nevertheless was almost convinced Schoenfeld would  
be back until a meeting Thursday night when Schoenfeld promised the 
power play would be better but couldn't give specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	Schoenfeld, whose career record is 256-246-78 in nine seasons as  
a coach, did not attend the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a situation where three people (including Burke) are  
looking at the forward direction of the hockey club and seeing it 
in a different way,'' he said in a news release.

<HEADLINE> Disabled Golf Pro Fails To Qualify  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Ford Olinger, who lost his attempt to  
force the USGA to allow him to ride a cart in the U.S. Open, failed 
to get out of the local qualifier on Monday, shooting a 17-over 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Olinger, who has a degenerative hip disorder, struggled at the  
South Bend Country Club in blustery conditions that featured 
intermittent rain, wind gusts up to 25 mph and temperatures in the 
upper 40s. Limping badly the entire round and often resting on his 
bag between shots, Olinger said he refused to quit during his 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here to play in the U.S. Open. I didn't come here to  
wimp out and go home,'' said Olinger, a pro from Warsaw. ``I had a 
feeling when I got here unless I was dead or they were dragging me, 
I was going to finish the course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olinger, who shot 44 on each nine, faded toward the end of his  
round. On the 211-yard par-3 17th, he put two balls in the water 
before holing out with an 8. Teeing off on the par-5 18th, Olinger 
grunted as his tee shot sailed down the fairway and said ``God, 
that hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It affected me,'' Olinger said of the pain in his hips, which  
forced him to take painkillers several times during the round. 
``I'm not making excuses. I shot an 88, period. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has to deal with pain. Some just have to deal with  
more pain than others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olinger shot an 83 last year on the same course after a federal  
judge granted him a temporary restraining order, forcing the U.S. 
Golf Association to allow him to ride in the local qualifier. He 
went back to court last week, seeking a permanent injunction 
granting him the accommodation under the Americans with 
Disabilities Act. But U.S. District Judge Robert Miller ruled that 
allowing him to use a cart would fundamentally alter the tournament 
and denied his request. 
</P>
<P>
	He vowed to be back next year at the local qualifier -- with or  
without a cart -- and whether or not he decides to appeal Miller's 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I set out a goal to participate in the U.S. Open, no matter  
what, and I did,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailed by reporters and camera crews during his round, Olinger  
parred two holes on the front nine before starting his back nine 
with consecutive pars. After two bogeys sandwiched around a double 
bogey, he parred Nos. 15 and 16 before his trouble at 17 and a par 
on the par-5 18th. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gutted it out. It's a credit to him,'' said Bob Lee, a  
local USGA official who testified against Olinger during last 
week's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Chalfant, who qualified for sectional play last year and  
played with Olinger on Monday, said he couldn't understand why the 
USGA would deny Olinger a cart, especially after watching him 
struggle down each fairway in pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really, I don't see it's that much of an advantage for him,''  
said Chalfant, who graduated from Purdue and now plays on several 
mini tours. ``For him to go out and walk in this wind was eight 
times harder for him that it was for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Medalist Josh Habig shot a 68, one of only three rounds below  
par, and was one of five players from the South Bend local 
qualifier to advance to sectional play. The junior at Northwestern 
said the USGA and PGA should be allowed to set the rules of 
competition and deny the use of a cart for any competitor. But he 
also said he'd want a cart, too, if he had to deal with Olinger's 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that it's golf and the nature of the game, it makes  
sense to give the guy a chance,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Most Major Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against most major currencies  
Monday as it followed tumbling U.S. stocks in the absence of 
guidance from economic data or other news. 
</P>
<P>
	``The life of the dollar is highly correlated right now with the  
stock market,'' said Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer 
at Bank Leumi USA. ``There was nothing else to look at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0594, rising from $1.0568 Friday. The  
dollar fell to 123.21 yen from 124.01 yen Friday, The dollar also 
was quoted at 1.5122 Swiss francs, down from 1.5166; and 1.4546 
Canadian dollars, down from 1.4610. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors had nothing fresh to guide their trading, so they  
played along with U.S. stocks. The broader market indicators fell 
as the Dow Jones industrial averages plummeted 203 points before 
ending the day down 174.61, or by 1.6 percent, at 10,654.67. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's fall, however, was far less grave.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's been some solace that (the dollar) hasn't fallen apart  
on the selloff in the marketplace,'' Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has been drawing its strength lately from the U.S.  
economy, not only the strongest in the world but in a league where 
the No. 2 economy, Japan, is in severe recession, and No. 3, 
Germany, is holding down Europe, which is engaged in expensive 
combat with Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency is holding its own against the yen also  
because traders and analysts consider economic recovery in Asia as 
poorly undergirded, Waxman said. Some countries have started 
regaining their foothold after the widespread collapse that began 
nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tenuous recovery. If someone like Japan sneezes, then  
the rest of Asia will need a massive dose of antibiotics,'' Waxman 
said. ``The market is very uncomfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As far as the new European currency is concerned, Waxman said,  
``The only thing that can make the euro bounce 3 or 4 cents is the 
immediate cessation of hostilities in Europe.'' NATO has been 
bombing Yugoslavia since the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading, the British pound fell to $1.5964 from  
$1.6013. 
</P>
<P>
	The currencies of the 11 countries that have switched to the  
euro are no longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a 
fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the euro's latest exchange rate, the dollar was worth:  
1.8460 German marks, down from 1.8508; 6.1920 French francs, down 
from 6.2073; and 1,828.15 Italian lire, down from 1,831.50.

<HEADLINE> Wrestler Dies During WWF Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- It wasn't supposed to be this way -- huge,  
muscular men in neon tights with tears in their eyes at a World 
Wrestling Federation event billed as ``Raw is War.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But this was the day after 34-year-old Owen Hart plummeted to  
his death and professional wrestling took time Monday night to 
mourn one of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Many wrestlers wept openly as the tributes for Hart began, and  
so did some of the 19,000 fans at the sold-out Kiel Center. The 
wrestlers wore black armbands with Hart's initials on them. The 
crowd chanted, ``Owen! Owen!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The death shocked fans of pro wrestling, where none of the  
performers are supposed to get hurt -- no matter how painful the 
pounding seems to fans. 
</P>
<P>
	More improvisational theater than sport, pro wrestling has been  
likened to soap opera for men, complete with storylines, subplots 
and love triangles. The eternal themes are respect, revenge and 
redemption. 
</P>
<P>
	In popular weekly broadcasts on cable television, wrestling has  
the flash and thunder of an rock concert, the costume and color of 
a Broadway production. 
</P>
<P>
	In that vein, Hart was about to make another of his dramatic  
entrances Sunday night. He had been attached to wires near the top 
of Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Mo., and the plan was for him to 
descend into the ring in ``superhero-type fashion,'' WWF President 
Vince McMahon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the wrestler plunged 90 feet into the ring. His head  
hit a padded turnbuckle, a metal coupling that holds the ring's 
ropes together, and snapped backward. Hart struggled to lift his 
head and his arms rose slowly, about a foot off the mat, then 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	Paramedics rushed into the ring, unraveling Hart's trademark  
``Blue Blazer'' mask and unsuccessfully trying to resuscitate him. 
He was pronounced dead at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade Keller, editor of the Pro Wrestling Torch newsletter, said  
it was the first fatal accident he knew of in U.S. wrestling since 
1969, when Mike DiBiase died of a heart attack during a match in 
Lubbock, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after Hart's body hit the canvas, many of the 16,200 fans  
thought the stunt was part of the scripted theatrics that have 
helped fuel the explosion of popularity in wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesman Floyd Mitchell said homicide detectives were  
inspecting Hart's rigging and talking to the stagehands to 
determine what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said the cable did not break, and detectives believe  
Hart's harness may have been hitched incorrectly. McMahon said he 
believes Hart may have accidentally pulled a release mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
	McMahon said WWF wrestlers will stop performing the aerial move  
that killed Hart, but said other stunts will continue. The WWF has 
scrapped plans to replay Sunday's event on pay-per-view TV and 
called off upcoming live events in Peoria, Ill.; Winnipeg, 
Manitoba; Hamilton, Ontario; Montreal and Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	But St. Louis was the next scheduled stop and the show went on.  
</P>
<P>
	``Out of respect for Owen, knowing the consummate performer he  
was, I'm sure members of the Hart family would concur with me that 
he would want the show to go on,'' McMahon said. 
</P>
<P>
	In videotaped messages from wrestlers played between matches,  
many recalled Hart as a loving father, a good husband and a 
prankster. A fellow wrestler remembered the time Hart slipped hot 
sauce in a pot of chili, prompting the cook to chase him as Hart 
laughed hysterically. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to miss him,'' Dustin Runnels said. ``I love you,  
Owen. I know you're in a better place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was evident from the start of the ceremony that Hart, part of  
a Canadian family with a rich wrestling heritage, was on the minds 
of many fans even before 10 bells tolled in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have mixed emotions about being here,'' said Chris Gegan,  
28, of Belleville, Ill. ``But I think the fans are paying tribute 
to Owen and the performer that he was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart was the youngest son of Stu Hart, a member of Canada's  
Olympic wrestling team in the 1940s. All seven of Stu Hart's sons 
went into wrestling, including Bret ``The Hitman'' Hart, a World 
Championship Wrestling star who canceled an appearance Monday on 
``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, a former pro wrestler, called the  
Harts ``a legendary family of wrestling'' and said Hart's death was 
a reminder that wrestling is a tough job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe people ought to start thinking about respecting them a  
little more,'' Ventura said. ``These performers give their heart 
and soul to their job.''

<HEADLINE> Conyers Churches Pray for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- With hugs and words of support, students  
returned to classes today at Heritage High School, including four 
of the six who were wounded in a shooting last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of deputies and state troopers guarded the school and  
helped direct traffic as the students arrived in buses and cars 
under a bright morning sun. But Principal Lowell Biddy said there 
was no extra security inside, except for a few parents who had 
volunteered to be in the hallways. 
</P>
<P>
	Biddy said 90 percent of Heritage students showed up for classes  
today, although some left early. Among those showing up were Jason 
Cheek, 17; Ryan Rosa, 18; Drake Hoy, 17; and Brian Barnhardt, 16, 
who were wounded Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several students hugged in the parking lot before they went  
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few students were apprehensive about coming into the  
building, but once they got support from their fellow students, 
they were OK,'' Biddy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The students were given extra time in home room to receive and  
sign their yearbooks, which they would have done last week but for 
the shootings. Final exams, scheduled for this week, are now 
optional for Heritage students. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really freaky and really weird with cops at every door,  
but I can't blame them for being here,'' said senior Matt Powell. 
``This is definitely not the way to go out. Everybody was excited 
to go to school Thursday, and then this happened.'' Thursday was to 
have been the seniors' last day of school. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he walked into the commons area today, and ``all I could  
do was picture it happening. I could not get it out of my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman, ``T.J.'' Solomon, 15, remained in a youth detention  
center. Authorities are expected to decide this week whether to try 
him as an adult for Thursday's shootings. Fellow students said 
Solomon was despondent over a recent breakup with his girlfriend. 
He had been taking Ritalin, a drug commonly prescribed for 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's mother, Mae Dean Daniele, apologized to the community  
in an interview shown today on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thank God that all the children are alive,'' she said. ``We  
grieve for each one of you and we pray for a full recovery from all 
the suffering of this tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Garland, the boy's lawyer, told CNN the defense would center  
on his mental condition, since the defense does not contest that 
Solomon was the shooter. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, churches in the area were filled with prayers for  
healing -- and for Solomon. Worshippers said they saw the gunman not 
as a fiend, but as a troubled youth badly needing God's peace. 
</P>
<P>
	At St. Simon's Episcopal, where several Heritage students  
worship, Solomon was listed in the bulletin's prayers of the week 
as one to remember. 
</P>
<P>
	``We pray for T.J., the young man who did this,'' said the Rev.  
Leon Watts Jr. ``We pray that this would never happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only one of the six victims remained hospitalized today.  
Stephanie Laster, 15, still has a bullet lodged in her abdomen but 
was in good condition at Hughes Spalding Children's Hospital in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Biddy said he had a brief conversation with Solomon just after  
an assistant principal disarmed him Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was quite hysterical,'' he said. ``I was asking him if he  
was OK. And then I asked the big questions. I asked if those are 
blanks, and he said no. Then I asked if he had acted alone, and he 
said yes. And then he started sobbing, and he said, `Mr. Biddy, I 
don't know why I did this. I just don't know why I did this.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Solomon's congregation, St. Pius X Catholic, erected  
three large sheets of blank paper at the back of the sanctuary for 
members' messages for Heritage students. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be a tomorrow and God will be there for you,'' was  
one of the hundreds of notes. ``God loves you,'' a child scrawled.

<HEADLINE> First Talks Held in Shipyard Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMPTON, Va. (AP) -- Negotiators for Newport News Shipbuilding,  
the nation's only builder of aircraft carriers, and the United 
Steelworkers met today for the first time since before the union 
went on strike seven weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for both sides said they hoped the meeting arranged by  
federal mediators would lead to a contract agreement and the end of 
the strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very optimistic,'' Arnold Outlaw, president of  
Steelworkers Local 8888, said as he and about a half dozen other 
union representatives headed into the closed meeting at a Hampton 
hotel. Local 8888 represents 9,200 hourly workers at the yard. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipyard spokesman Mike Hatfield would not say whether the yard  
was willing to budge from what it called its final contract offer, 
which it delivered during the last talks, on March 30. The strike 
began April 5, when the old contract expired. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield said shipyard officials are hopeful about ending the  
strike now that talks have resumed. But he added that the union 
must be realistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot pay more than what the industry standard is or we  
will not be competitive,'' Hatfield said. ``We made the best offer 
in the industry and we were really surprised they didn't take 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company offered an overall increase of $2.49 an hour over 47  
months for the average worker, who makes $13.50. The union wanted 
an across-the-board increase of $3.95 an hour over 36 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides also have been unable to agree on pension and  
health care benefits.

<HEADLINE> England's Rugby Captain Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lawrence Dallaglio resigned as England's rugby  
union captain on Monday following allegations that he had used and 
sold drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was announced by the English Rugby Football Union  
after a three-hour meeting with Dallaglio. 
</P>
<P>
	English rugby was shocked Sunday when the tabloids News of the  
World newspaper published the drug allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to be a drug dealer,'' the newspaper quoted Dallaglio  
as saying. ``I made big, big money from dealing in drugs. That's 
how I used to make money before I took up rugby.''

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Stepashin Review Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin flew to southern  
Russia today to confer with Boris Yeltsin on doling out the 
remaining posts in the new Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian president, who has final say in the makeup of the  
government, abruptly went to the Black Sea resort town of Sochi for 
a vacation last Friday before completing the new Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Yeltsin reinstated many of his old ministers, a few  
critical spots remain empty, including finance minister and deputy 
prime minister in charge of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin has said he wants to retain Mikhail Zadornov as  
finance minister and give Alexander Zhukov the deputy premier role, 
and that the Cabinet should be complete by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stepashin has stressed that he will defer to Yeltsin in all  
Cabinet decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's vacation came after he scored a major political  
victory over the lower house of parliament, the State Duma. He 
fired the government on May 12, faced down an attempt by the lower 
chamber to impeach him on May 15, and then watched as the body 
quickly approved Stepashin as the new prime minister on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin, accompanied by Yeltsin's chief of staff, Alexander  
Voloshin, stopped off early today in the republic of 
Karachayevo-Cherkessia, where a vote to elect a regional leader has 
become embroiled in controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions have mounted in the region near breakaway Chechnya  
after the losing candidate accused his opponent of rigging the 
balloting. The apparent winner has asked the Russian Supreme Court 
to review the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin met briefly with both candidates in an effort to  
defuse the situation, and then continued on to Sochi. Upon arrival, 
he and Voloshin flew by helicopter to Yeltsin's residence.

<HEADLINE> First Talks Held in Shipyard Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMPTON, Va. (AP) -- The union representing Newport News  
Shipbuilding workers has given the shipyard a modified contract 
proposal, but the company did not indicate the proposal marked a 
breakthrough in the seven-week strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks Monday were the first since the walkout began April 5.  
</P>
<P>
	The union offered to settle the wage dispute for an  
across-the-board increase of $3.70 an hour over 36 months, United 
Steelworkers spokesman John Duray said. That's a 25-cent drop from 
the union's previous demand of $3.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipyard spokeswoman Jerri Fuller Dickseski said the company,  
the nation's only builder of aircraft carriers, would review the 
union's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, we're disappointed because on first glance it doesn't  
appear that they've modified their position anywhere close to the 
competitive framework we've outlined,'' Ms. Dickseski said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, in an offer made March 30, said it would boost the  
average employee's wage of $13.50 an hour by $2.49 an hour over 47 
months. The shipyard had said that was its final offer, which it 
called the best in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials said the optimism they felt before Monday's  
talks waned by the time the meeting ended in late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the company has any intention of trying to  
bargain in good faith,'' said Arnold Outlaw, president of 
Steelworkers Local 8888, which represents 9,200 hourly workers at 
the shipyard. ``I think they are trying to break the spirit of the 
union.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outlaw said both sides met separately with mediators and then,  
``We got back together for some chit-chat. We gave the company a 
counter proposal. Shortly after we gave it to them, they walked 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting was convened under an order of the Federal Mediation  
and Conciliation Service. Union representatives were scheduled to 
meet with federal mediators again today, Outlaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dickseski said company negotiators will be available to meet  
again as well ``if we receive a call to return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides also have been unable to agree on pension and  
health care benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, shipyard spokesman Mike Hatfield said more employees  
return to work every day and that the yard is operating at 
``something approaching 60 percent productivity.'' He declined to 
say how many workers had crossed the picket line. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers walking the picket line at the shipyard Monday said they  
were resolved to stay off the job for as long as necessary to get a 
better contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila Harrison, 35, of Surry County, said she doubted the talks  
would lead to a quick resolution, unless shipyard officials eased 
their position. ``They're stubborn,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Still, anything's better than nothing,'' added Ms. Harrison, a  
ship painter who has worked at the yard eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Laverne Kenon, 39, of Chesapeake, said she wanted the union to  
remain firm and not give a lot of concessions just to end the 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers ``have given up a lot in the past,'' said Ms. Kenon,  
an insulator and ship cleaner with 11 years at the yard. ``It's 
time that they (shipyard officials) give us something.''

Thursday. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not released.  
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes James knew politics from the inside, serving as a clerk

shape West Germany's democratic government after World War II, died 
Wednesday of coronary artery disease. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockwell moved to Berlin in 1945 to serve as legal adviser to  
the commander of American forces occupying part of Germany. He was 
assigned to rebuild the German legal system, blending German

<HEADLINE> Olivetti Stymies Deutsche Telekom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Olivetti's stunning acquisition of a majority  
stake in Telecom Italia has dealt a severe blow to Germany's 
Deutsche Telekom and its ambition of creating a pan-European 
telecommunications leader and world-class competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti SpA's hostile action has stymied Deutsche Telekom AG's  
plan to merge with Telecom Italia SpA and left it struggling to 
mend tattered ties with France Telecom, its partner in other 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Deutsche Telekom's biggest German competitor,  
Mannesmann AG, has gained strength and a firm foothold in Italy by 
buying out Olivetti's stake in two telephone subsidiaries. 
Mannesmann's $8 billion purchase of the cellular unit Omnitel and 
fixed-line operator Infostrada helped Olivetti finance its highly 
leveraged bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom's chief executive Ron Sommer gamely insists  
that he hopes to salvage a merger with Telecom Italia under its new 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sommer's bargaining position in any future deal may suffer  
as a result of the Italian setback. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gambled on this one. It's now fallen flat. He's upset  
France Telecom. Where does he go from here?'' said Mark Horn, an 
industry analyst at London-based brokerage T. Hoare Canaccord. 
</P>
<P>
	By grabbing nearly 52 percent of its larger rival's shares in a  
$64 billion bid, Olivetti has forced a competitive realignment in 
Europe's telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom had spoken publicly just weeks ago about its  
desire to acquire a U.S. company and compete on a global scale with 
the likes of AT&AMP;T Corp. Now, shorn of its chosen partner, it must 
drastically alter its expansion strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our objective remains that of becoming a global player,''  
spokesman Juergen Kindervater was quoted as saying by Italy's Ansa 
news agency. ``Telecom Italia is an option, but there are others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calls seeking further details from Deutsche Telekom's  
headquarters in Bonn were not immediately returned on Monday, which 
was a holiday in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rome, Telecom Italia chief executive Franco Bernabe met  
Monday with his Olivetti counterpart Roberto Colaninno to discuss 
the transfer of corporate control. It was the pair's first meeting 
since Olivetti garnered its slim majority of support from Telecom 
shareholders on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno has not ruled out merging with Deutsche Telekom,  
albeit on different terms than the ones Bernabe agreed to. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always said that I'm not against discussing all  
opportunities,'' he said this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading in Milan, Italy, Olivetti stock rose 1.8 percent  
Monday to the equivalent of $3.65 a share, while Telecom Italia 
fell 2.1 percent to $9.94 a share. On the New York Stock Exchange, 
the U.S. shares of Telecom Italia fell 9 percent, or by $9.81 1/4, to 
close at $99.18 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia executives were expected to  
meet as early as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the German-Italian merger plans collapse, as many  
analysts predict, Deutsche Telekom may need to rebuild politically 
sensitive relations with France Telecom. The French phone company 
was outraged when Deutsche Telekom unveiled it merger plans with 
Telecom Italia and has threatened to sue for billions of dollars, 
citing breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom have reciprocal 2 percent  
shareholdings, and together with Sprint Corp. of the United States, 
they own the Global One joint venture. They also hold minority 
stakes in the Italian telephone consortium Wind. 
</P>
<P>
	Exacerbating Deutsche Telekom's problems is the rise of domestic  
competitors like Mannesmann, a former engineering firm. Mannesmann 
teamed up with Olivetti and expanded its ownership of Omnitel, 
taking an even bigger position in Italy, Europe's biggest mobile 
phone market. 
</P>
<P>
	Uncertain of his prospects with either Telecom Italia or France  
Telecom, Deutsche Telekom's Sommer may seek other alliances. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts point to Britain's No. 2 phone company, Cable &AMP;  
Wireless PLC, as a possible target -- speculation that the British 
company has denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom plans to raise some $10.6 billion by issuing  
new shares next month, greatly enhancing its ability to finance a 
merger or acquisition. It plans also to bring in additional cash by 
spinning off much of its domestic cable business.

<HEADLINE> Reds' Neagle Placed on 15-day DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Denny Neagle, who is 0-3 with an 8.17 ERA in  
six starts, was placed on the 15-day disabled list by the 
Cincinnati Reds Monday, retroactive to May 20. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jim Bowden said Neagle has tendinitis in his  
left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``The medical information we have been provided is not  
consistent with our baseball evaluation,'' Bowden said. 
``Therefore, we have asked for additional medical opinions and 
evaluations of Denny's left shoulder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle, who was obtained from the Atlanta Braves during the  
off-season, was diagnosed with weakness in the rotator cuff in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	That diagnosis was affirmed in an examination Friday by Dr.  
Ralph Gambardella at the Kerlan-Jobe Clinic in Los Angeles. 
However, surgery was not recommended. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our present plan for treatment is not working,'' Bowden said.  
``There is no point continuing along a path that has not allowed 
the strength in Denny's left shoulder to improve. 
</P>
<P>
	``If surgery is not recommended by the physicians, then we must  
find a better way to strengthen the rotator cuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Post reported that the MRI performed in Los  
Angeles showed that Neagle likely has a slight tear in the 
underside of his rotator cuff, and minor fraying of the labrum 
cartilage in the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said a copy of the MRI would be sent to Dr. Steve  
Pomeranz of Pro-Scan in Cincinnati for analysis. Copies also have 
been sent to Dr. Stanley Ho at Stanford University, and to Dr. 
James Meranus of Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle also is scheduled to be examined Wednesday by Dr. James  
Andrews in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle had won at least 16 games in each of the past three  
seasons and was expected to be the Reds' ace.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Judges Busy Travelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When they weren't hearing oral arguments or  
working on decisions, the nine members of the Supreme Court 
collectively were a busy band of travelers in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial disclosure forms released Monday show they took 100  
trips paid for by others last year, mostly for speaking 
engagements, short-term teaching stints or programs with legal 
officials in other countries. The exact costs weren't listed. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading traveler was Justice Antonin Scalia, who took 24  
trips paid for by a variety of state bar associations, 
universities, nonprofit associations and the New York Stock 
Exchange. Scalia visits included Venice, Italy and Dublin, Ireland 
as well as the Bronx and Macon, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, Justice David Souter took only one paid trip: a  
moot court competition financed by Harvard Law School. 
</P>
<P>
	Some forays were unusual. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, for  
instance, got a free ride to dedicate the new Sandra Day O'Connor 
High School last September in San Antonio, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I delivered a speech and met with students and faculty,''  
O'Connor reported on her form. ``The school paid for my round-trip 
air transportation and overnight lodging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor also received a carved limestone piece worth $175 from  
the school and listed two other such gifts: a $1,500 crystal cameo 
for a lecture at Scripps College and an $875 Steuben glass 
sculpture from the Junior Leagues International. 
</P>
<P>
	Scalia had to attach a separate letter to his form because he  
originally forgot to list four prints and one tempura painting 
worth a combined $350 he was given by artist Giacinto Orfanello. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg received a combined $14,000 in  
honoraria for speaking engagements at three college law schools, 
but she didn't accept any of it. Instead, Ginsburg designated the 
money for Georgetown University's women's law school program, a 
children's foundation and for the Columbia Law School. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Stephen G. Breyer listed eight trips, including the  
annual Dec. 29-31 get-together known as ``Renaissance Weekend'' in 
Hilton Head, S.C., also a yearly trek for President Clinton. 
``Participated in panels,'' Breyer noted dryly about the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the justices reported outside income for teaching law  
courses or delivering university lectures. Two reached the $20,000 
legal limit: Scalia, who listed seven teaching jobs, and Justice 
Anthony M. Kennedy, who had four. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William Rehnquist listed income from two teaching  
positions, $12,500 from St. Mary's University and $6,282 from the 
University of Arizona School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
	As in years past, the wealthiest justice was Ginsburg, who with  
her husband, attorney Martin D. Ginsburg, listed assets ranging 
between $5.9 million and $24.1 million. Next in wealth is Breyer, 
who reported between $4.4 million and $11 million in assets -- 
compared to last year's $4.3 million to $15.9 million.

<HEADLINE> Bioethics Panel Urges Embryo Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress should rescind parts of its four-year  
ban on spending federal money for embryonic research, President 
Clinton's top advisory panel on medical ethics says in a draft 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Bioethics Advisory Commission acknowledges the  
report will generate controversy but it says the research's promise 
for the betterment of mankind merits the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This research is allied with a noble cause, and any taint that  
might attach from the source of the stem cells diminishes in 
proportion to the potential good which the research may yield,'' 
the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission recommends a regime of tightly controlled  
experiments to obtain so-called ``stem cells'' from embryos left 
over from procedures at fertility clinics. They would be used only 
with the consent of the parents for whom the embryos were created. 
</P>
<P>
	Stem cells have been shown in recent years to be building blocks  
for almost all human tissue. Scientists say the cells' capability 
to grow into virtually any tissue raises the possibility of growing 
spare body parts or correcting disorders such as Parkinson's 
disease or diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Parshall, chief spokeswoman for the Family Research  
Council, criticized the recommendation as ``a classic example of 
situational ethics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's the worst kind of utilitarianism ... to say we  
will destroy these so those can live,'' she said. ``One would only 
hope that common sense and compassion would rule the day rather 
than scientific advancement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer, a conservative activist who is seeking the  
Republican presidential nomination, urged Clinton to reject the 
policy. ``It can never be acceptable to take an innocent human life 
and that includes the embryonic stage,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Brown, president of the American Life League, also attacked  
the commission conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are not two classes of human beings,'' she said. ``The  
embryo baby is no different than any other human being and should 
never be subjected to destructive research.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bioethics panel's recommendation, being announced officially  
next month, goes further than a proposal last month from a National 
Institutes of Health advisory committee on financing research in 
stem cells, which are obtainable only from human embryos or very 
early fetuses. The NIH rules would allow the institutes to finance 
studies only on cell cultures grown in laboratories and not taken 
from embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	Embryos are destroyed in the process of harvesting stem cells, a  
reason such research has raised emotional debate in Congress and 
elsewhere between people on both sides of the abortion question. At 
least 75 members of Congress have said all stem-cell research 
violates the money ban, which has been extended annually since its 
enactment in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Aguilera Hopes To Save Cubs' Pen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Finding Wrigley Field was no problem for Rick  
Aguilera. In fact, he had more trouble locating the bathroom in his 
new home clubhouse than he did driving to work. All part of a 
fitting-in process Monday for the Chicago Cubs' new closer. 
</P>
<P>
	Aguilera had a rough night in his home debut with his new team,  
giving up four runs in the ninth inning to suffer the loss as the 
Florida Marlins beat the Cubs 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the way I was hoping to start off. It's a long season  
and I didn't expect not to have a bad day. But I certainly wasn't 
expecting one this soon,'' Aguilera said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aguilera wanted to stay with the Minnesota Twins and finish his  
career as a closer. But when trade rumors began before spring 
training, he did some checking and after talking with Chicago 
starter Kevin Tapani, one of his best friends, he eventually 
designated the Cubs as a team he'd join. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked what the team was like and I said it was like the  
team we had in Minnesota in the early 90s,'' Tapani said. ``Guys 
who play hard, get along and are winners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aguilera's reasons for choosing Chicago, he said, were numerous:  
Some of his former teammates included Tapani, Gary Gaetti, reliever 
Dan Serafini and even team GM Ed Lynch from his days with the New 
York Mets. He also called Wrigley Field his favorite park in the 
majors. And he and Tapani's family are extremely close. 
</P>
<P>
	After earlier waiving a no-trade clause, Aguilera was dealt to  
Chicago last week along with Scott Downs for minor league pitchers 
Jason Ryan and Kyle Lohse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not coming here to replace Rod and I'm not coming here  
saying I have to close,'' Aguilera said. ``I told Riggs I came here 
to do whatever I can to help. I hope I'm not expected to come here 
and save every game because I'm not. I'm going to have bad days 
like everybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aguilera, 37, is 19 saves shy of 300 and had a 1.27 ERA with a  
3-1 record and six saves when he left the Twins. He's pitched one 
inning so far with the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	A closer's life can change in a hurry. With one pitch.  
</P>
<P>
	After saving 51 games last season, Beck blew four saves in 11  
chances, had a 10.54 ERA and was 2-4, bringing out the boos birds. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife mentioned that, that they've really been getting on  
Rod Beck after the kind of season he had last year,'' Aguilera 
said. ``I played in New York where there are serious fans and it's 
something I can't control. I hope to pitch well and contribute. If 
that doesn't seem to materialize and I'm booed, we'll have to get 
through that. We'll see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aguilera is also well aware that Beck, who underwent  
arthroscopic surgery, is expected to return before the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally I hope nothing is going to create a conflict  
personally between him and me,'' Aguilera said. ``I hope he is back 
as quickly as he can be and we can work together out of the 
bullpen, however Jim wants to work the bullpen.''

<HEADLINE> TV Carts That Might Tip Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The manufacturer of some 2 million oak  
television carts that pose a danger of tipping over is offering a 
repair kit to keep them upright. 
</P>
<P>
	Sauder Woodworking Co. of Archbold, Ohio, has received 13  
reports of carts tipping and televisions falling -- in one case 
fracturing the skull of a 3-year-old girl, the federal Consumer 
Product Safety Commission said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a hidden danger that you might not be aware of until  
it's too late,'' said commission chairwoman Ann Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	The ready-to-assemble carts can hold both a TV set and a video  
cassette recorder. They feature a swivel on which the television 
can rest atop the cart and a bottom shelf with hinged double doors. 
</P>
<P>
	Involved in the recall are carts in brown oak (model 5155),  
black oak (model 5055) and white oak (model 5251). The model 
numbers are on the instruction booklet that accompanies the cart, 
and the name ``Sauder'' is on the caster or on a metal plate inside 
the cart's door. 
</P>
<P>
	The carts measure about 30 inches wide, 25 inches high with the  
casters and 16 inches deep. 
</P>
<P>
	Discount stores, home centers and furniture stores nationwide  
sold the carts from March 1989 through September 1998 for about $35 
to $49. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners should remove their televisions and VCRs from the carts  
immediately, the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can contact Sauder toll-free at 888-800-4590, between  
7 a.m. and 11 p.m. EDT Monday through Friday, or through the 
company's Web site at www.sauder.com. Sauder representatives will 
help owners determine if their cart is part of the recall and will 
send free repair kits. 
</P>
<P>
	The kit consists of wood pieces that can be installed to widen  
the base of the cart and prevent it from tipping over.

	Report: China Nukes Near U.S. Par  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After two decades of stealing U.S. secrets,  
China can build advanced, mobile nuclear weapons ``on a par with 
our own'' and it could begin testing one such weapon as early as 
this year, a congressional report finds. ``These thefts of nuclear 
secrets from our national weapons laboratories enabled (China) to 
... successfully test modern strategic weapons sooner than would 
otherwise have been possible,'' according to a copy of the report 
obtained by The Associated Press. The report, to be released 
tomorrow, is by a House committee on Chinese espionage. It says 
China stole secrets about the seven major U.S. nuclear warheads and 
the neutron bomb. The thefts ``almost certainly continue to the 
present,'' the House report concluded.

made to pay victims. The court also decided that police who let the 
news media accompany them into people's homes can be sued for 
violating the Constitution's protection against unreasonable 
searches. It also turned down an appeal by a Maine dentist who was 
sued for refusing to treat a woman because she has the virus that

<HEADLINE> Bradley Campaigning Against Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Campaigning to overtake Vice President Al Gore  
in ``a brand new game,'' Democratic challenger Bill Bradley isn't 
ready to argue about their differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not at a contrast stage right now,'' he said. ``This is  
not where things are. This is the defining stage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His is a careful, cautious game plan, in which, for example, he  
says trust is essential to a president and describes that as 
something in need of repair -- but he won't blame President 
Clinton's misconduct and impeachment for the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, fill in the blanks,'' is as far as he'll venture.  
</P>
<P>
	A candidate tackling a vice president with presidential  
political sponsorship, along with most of the party establishment, 
would ordinarily take the offensive from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	Not Bradley. He passes up open targets. He'll go only so far as  
to describe his record in the Senate -- he was there from New Jersey 
while Gore was senator from Tennessee -- as one of more risk-taking 
to deal with complex issues such as tax reform, trade and race, 
despite the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a risk of leadership, and I think the vice president has  
been more cautious,'' Bradley said in an interview with The 
Associated Press. ``And I think there is a difference. I think it 
implies a different kind of presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he's not addressing Gore's sometimes embarrassing  
involvement in 1996 campaign finance excesses. Bradley said that 
``to be a credible advocate for campaign finance reform as 
president,'' he has to do his own fund raising for 2000 on a 
standard higher than the existing law requires. No loopholes, he 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
	So, will Gore's past problems affect his future franchise on  
that issue? 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't know that until after you see the way a campaign is  
conducted,'' Bradley fenced. ``I think a campaign defines a 
candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As to the question of trust, in a president, in political  
institutions, and of a president in the people, Bradley said he 
wants to repair it, although Gore could, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why not. I think he's been an honorable man, as  
far as I know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans criticize Gore as a cheerleader for Clinton. Bradley  
does not. ``I'm not going to get into criticizing the vice 
president, how he's conducted himself,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	What about Gore's description of Clinton as one of the great  
presidents? 
</P>
<P>
	``I actually thought Lincoln was better.''  
</P>
<P>
	On the current agenda, Bradley is considering an aggressive gun  
control proposal that may include a ban on the sale of handguns, 
along with a national handgun card with a photo ID, registration of 
gun resales as is done with automobiles, higher license fees for 
dealers and a stiff federal tax on handguns and ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	He laid out much of that program, but not the outright ban, as a  
senator. ``I'm considering all the alternatives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But for later in the campaign, not now.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore just got a boost on the gun control issue by casting the  
tie-breaking Senate vote to pass a measure requiring background 
checks of all firearms purchasers at gun shows and pawn shops. ``I 
applaud it,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Bradley, his task at this point is to tell people  
who he is, not how he differs with his opponent. A new poll shows 
97 percent of voters have heard of Gore, to Bradley's 60 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But he is going to have to tell people where he disagrees with  
Gore or he won't have much of an argument for a change by 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you should do that in the fall,'' said Bradley,  
describing that as the ``beginning of the engagement of the 
campaign not only with the Democratic opponent but also with 
potential Republican opponents on the most thorough level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That cautious schedule defies conventional wisdom as the  
strategy of a candidate trying to catch up, but Bradley said this 
is different. 
</P>
<P>
	``As it has evolved, it's a brand new game,'' he said. ``There's  
never been a one-on-one, 11-month primary before. ... This is a 
totally different pace and a different rhythm. It's a different 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also is an expensive one, and Bradley got off to a  
respectable, to some surprising, start raising funds for 2000, 
reporting that he took in $4.3 million in the first three months of 
1999. Gore raised more than twice as much, toward a campaign target 
of $55 million. Bradley said he can be competitive with a 
$20-to-$25 million campaign budget.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Under Fire for Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The entertainment industry has been very kind  
to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, donating more than $500,000 to the 
California Democrat's campaigns since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet when she was faced with a proposal mandating a federal  
investigation into Hollywood's marketing practices for violent 
shows and games, Feinstein voted yes. The blood of Littleton, she 
decided, couldn't be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't it time,'' she asked, ``at the very least, that the  
manufacturers of video games, television programs, motion pictures 
and music acknowledge the impact on young people of the carnage 
they promulgate?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the weeks since two students rampaged through a Colorado high  
school, killing 12 classmates and a teacher, Hollywood has been 
under siege by lawmakers -- friends and foes alike. The industry has 
been lumped in with tobacco, alcohol and guns as a social scourge 
in need of governmental intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	And the heat is only going to increase. On Thursday, a  
15-year-old boy upset over a broken romance shot and wounded six 
students at a high school in suburban Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	That there was no evidence that movies, television, music or  
video games played any direct role in the Georgia attack doesn't 
matter in the current political climate. Lawmakers are now pointing 
to Hollywood as a major contributor to a wider cultural problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I see is that we've fundamentally, as a society, moved to  
a culture that glorifies violence and death,'' said Sen. Sam 
Brownback, R-Kan. ``The whole message that people are trying to 
send to the (entertainment) industry is that if you glorify 
gratuitous violence, it has an impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brownback was the sponsor of the legislation, voted on by  
Feinstein, to authorize an investigation by the Federal Trade 
Commission and the Department of Justice into whether Hollywood is 
marketing violent shows and games to children. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure overwhelmingly passed earlier this month.  
</P>
<P>
	It is just one of several steps taken in Washington since the  
April massacre in Littleton, Colo. -- from authorization of a study 
of violent entertainment to requiring government agencies to 
consider a show's violence level before granting a permit to film 
on federal property. 
</P>
<P>
	And there have been signs that Hollywood is getting the message.  
Last week, CBS said it was leaving off its schedule a pilot series 
called ``Falcone,'' about a mob war in New York City, because of 
concerns about its violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt a responsibility not to put it on now,'' CBS President  
Leslie Moonves said. ``It just didn't feel right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others in Hollywood have been either silent or defiant. Two  
of the world's most powerful entertainment executives have 
criticized politicians for singling out Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that the American people who really look to  
their government for leadership instead get finger-pointing and 
chest-pounding,'' said Edgar Bronfman, chief executive Seagram Co., 
parent of Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence ``is not an entertainment problem,'' he said earlier  
this month in Florida. ``It's a societal problem and I believe the 
government would be well-served to deal with it as a societal 
problem rather than create a quick fix that may be popular but 
ultimately is a disservice to their constituents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in a speech last month in Beverly Hills, Time Warner  
Chairman Gerald Levin, whose son was stabbed and shot to death 
during a robbery in May 1997, called for an end to the 
``proliferation of guns'' and condemned what he called 
grandstanding politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the season of political opportunism,'' Levin told the  
Hollywood Radio and Television Society. ``I can't help but think 
that television is an easy scapegoat. Where is the cry to stop the 
proliferation of guns?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has, in fact, passed a number of new gun restrictions  
as amendments to a juvenile crime bill. On Thursday, the Senate 
slapped fresh restrictions on firearms sales at gun shows and 
pawnshops. 
</P>
<P>
	But senators have also gone after Hollywood. Along with the  
investigation of marketing practices, the Senate has authorized a 
federal study into the psychological effects violent video games 
and music have on youths. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers also have proposed making the movie industry's  
voluntary ratings system legally enforceable, holding a theater 
owner liable for allowing underage kids into movies rated R or 
NC-17. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Wednesday, the Senate passed a requirement that federal  
agencies not grant permits for movie or TV filming on government 
property until they consider whether the production ``glorifies or 
endorses wanton and gratuitous violence.''

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From China Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from the congressional report on Chinese espionage  
aimed at U.S. nuclear secrets and satellite technology: 
</P>
<P>
	``The People's Republic of China (PRC) has stolen design  
information on the United States' most advanced thermonuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Select Committee judges that the PRC's next generation of  
thermonuclear weapons, currently under development, will exploit 
elements of stolen U.S. design information. 
</P>
<P>
	``PRC penetration of our national weapons laboratories spans at  
least the past several decades and almost certainly continues 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``These thefts of nuclear secrets from our national weapons  
laboratories enabled the PRC to design, develop and successfully 
test modern strategic nuclear weapons sooner than would otherwise 
have been possible. The stolen U.S. nuclear secrets give the PRC 
design information on thermonuclear weapons on a par with our 
own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The stolen information includes classified information on  
seven U.S. thermonuclear warheads, including every currently 
deployed thermonuclear warhead in the U.S. ballistic missile 
arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stolen information also includes classified design  
information for an enhanced radiation weapon (commonly known as the 
`neutron bomb'), which neither the United States, nor any other 
nation, has yet deployed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``In addition, in the mid-1990s the PRC stole, possibly from a  
U.S. national weapons laboratory, classified thermonuclear weapons 
information that cannot be identified in this unclassified report. 
Because this recent espionage case is currently under investigation 
and involves sensitive intelligence sources and methods, the 
Clinton administration has determined that further information 
cannot be made public without affecting national security or 
ongoing criminal investigations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The Select Committee has found that the primary focus of this  
long-term, ongoing PRC intelligence collection effort has been on 
the following national weapons laboratories: 
</P>
<P>
	--Los Alamos  
</P>
<P>
	--Lawrence Livermore  
</P>
<P>
	--Oak Ridge  
</P>
<P>
	--Sandia''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``With the stolen U.S. technology, the PRC has leaped, in a  
handful of years, from 1950s-era strategic nuclear capabilities to 
the more modern thermonuclear weapons designs. These modern 
thermonuclear weapons took the United States decades of effort, 
hundreds of millions of dollars and numerous nuclear tests to 
achieve.''

<HEADLINE> Hawks Go Out in Four Straight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the end, the Atlanta Hawks simply ran out of  
healthy bodies. And that is not a good thing to happen to a team in 
the run-and-gun NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks went into their second-round playoff series against  
the New York Knicks undermanned, missing LaPhonso Ellis, who has 
been sidelined since mid-March with a hernia, and Alan Henderson, 
suffering from double vision. 
</P>
<P>
	This is like an automobile suddenly going from its six-cylinder  
configuration down to four. The pickup is reduced considerably. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the schedule which demanded back-to-back games on  
Sunday and Monday, not a good arrangement in the best of 
circumstances and one that doomed a team playing with a short 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
	It showed in the second half of Game 4 Monday night when  
arm-weary Atlanta missed 15 straight shots, ending any chance it 
might have had against the deeper Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	It added up to a four-game sweep for the Knicks, capped by a  
79-66 victory Monday night and marked the first time in the long 
coaching career of Lenny Wilkens that he has gone out of a 
best-of-7 series without winning at least one game. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkens is a Hall of Fame player and coach, the winningest coach  
in the history of the NBA. But the best bench boss in the world 
still needs some warm bodies to win games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to go against the Knicks if you don't have but six  
people,'' Wilkens said. ``We didn't have the bodies to bang with 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he wasn't about to lean on the injuries as an explanation  
for the Hawks quick elimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were the better team,'' Wilkens said of the Knicks.  
``They were much better than we were. They executed, they ran, they 
defended, they did all the right things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the missing players?  
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have those players going in,'' Wilkens said. ``I'm  
not making excuses. We didn't play well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the injuries had an impact on Atlanta's season even  
before the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we got LaPhonso Ellis into the system, he got  
hurt,'' Wilkens said. ``Then Alan Henderson got hurt and after we 
got him back, he got hurt again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tipoff to the Hawks' problems came in the first playoff  
series against Detroit. They won the first two games at home, each 
by 20 points, but then got blown out in Games 3 and 4 on the road. 
They scored just 63 points in Game 3, their lowest playoff total in 
franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	Uh-oh.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks survived in Game 5, but it turned out to be only a  
temporary reprieve for Wilkens' beat-up basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation was so serious that Atlanta was counting on  
anonymous second-year players like Chris Crawford and Ed Gray to 
rescue them. It worked only briefly. 
</P>
<P>
	Did the Detroit series soften up the Hawks for the Knicks?  
</P>
<P>
	``It may have,'' Wilkens said. ``It's hard to say. Crawford  
separated his shoulder. That's hard. He didn't shoot well after 
that.''

<HEADLINE> 'Star Wars' Stolen From Wis. Theater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MENOMONIE, Wis. (AP) -- A $60,000 copy of ``Star Wars: Episode I  
-- The Phantom Menace'' was stolen right off the projector at a 
theater over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, weighing more than 40 pounds, was taken from the  
first-floor projection room of the State Theater between showings 
Friday and Saturday, theater owner Nick LeGros said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the 23 years I've been doing this, this is the first time  
I've had a film stolen,'' LeGros said. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone could make money by converting the movie to  
videocassette and selling it on the black market, police Lt. Doug 
Briggs said. 
</P>
<P>
	The size and weight of the film have police thinking more than  
one person stole the movie. There were no signs of forced entry, 
police said.

	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore told Florida  
supporters Monday that he celebrated his 29th wedding anniversary 
with a visit to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic presidential contender said he had made  
reservations to celebrate with his wife, Tipper, at a cozy country 
inn outside Washington. But that was before the Senate began debate 
last week on an administration-supported amendment to tighten 
restrictions on gun show sales. 
</P>
<P>
	As he and Mrs. Gore headed out on their romantic escape, Gore  
said he checked in with the office on how the Senate vote was 
going. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tipper so strongly supported the amendment that was pending  
... that I celebrated our anniversary by going to the Senate and 
casting the tie-breaking vote,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 250 supporters of ``Gore 2000'' paid $1,000 apiece to share  
mixed greens, grilled chicken and New York cheesecake with the vice 
president. Gore apologized for shaking just a few hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're on a schedule here and they told me that I had to try to  
eat quickly and then talk,'' he said. 
</P>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential aspirant Gary Bauer  
urged President Clinton on Monday to be ``morally courageous'' and 
reverse an advisory panel's recommendations for government funding 
of limited forms of human embryo research. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Bioethics Advisory Commission recommended in a  
draft report to Congress that the four-year ban on spending federal 
money for embryonic research be rescinded in part. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can never be acceptable to take an innocent human life and  
that includes the embryonic stage,'' said Bauer, who opposes 
abortion. ``This president should be morally courageous enough to 
step in and reverse his own panel's recommendation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said that despite arguments that embryonic research has  
potentially enormous medical benefits, it actually has the opposite 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``Snuffing out life in its earliest stage can never be to the  
greater good,'' Bauer said. ``It sends the signal that some life is 
expendable depending on the circumstances.'' 
</P>

	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush is sharply  
criticizing a parody of his presidential campaign's Internet web 
site, calling it ``garbage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The parody site, gwbush.com, is nearly identical to the  
legitimate Bush site, except on close inspection, its ``news'' 
items about the Republican governor are obviously satirical. 
</P>
<P>
	One item, for example, says Bush has ``a bold new policy  
initiative to free all `grown ups' from federal prisons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference last week, Bush was asked about the parody,  
and he had some harsh words for the site's designer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There ought to be limits to freedom,'' Bush said. ``We're  
aware of the site, and this guy is just a garbage man, that's all 
he is. Of course I don't appreciate it. And you wouldn't, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Thomas, one of the site's operators, said in a telephone  
interview the Bush campaign is overreacting to humorous satire. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are opinions and there are facts,'' Thomas said. ``What  
we're doing is satire. He keeps saying this goes beyond humor. In 
fact, good humor often has a point. We're talking about Bush, we're 
talking about politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The address for the official Bush web site is  
www.georgewbush.com.

<HEADLINE> New York Governor Backs Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Gov. George Pataki, flanked Monday by  
the most of the state's Republican leadership, endorsed George W. 
Bush's bid for the GOP presidential nomination. ``I'm going to 
count on you for the state of New York,'' the Texas governor told 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	That is no easy task. The state, with a 5-3 Democratic  
enrollment advantage, hasn't backed the Republican presidential 
candidate since Ronald Reagan carried it twice, in 1980 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki is the 16th Republican governor to endorse Bush, who has  
said he won't start campaigning until the conclusion of the Texas 
legislative session at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a satellite hookup, Pataki told Bush, ``This is the team  
that in November of 2000 is going to shock the world by electing 
George W. Bush and carrying New York state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While more than 20 television cameras recorded the event, Pataki  
cooled speculation that he might run for the Senate. He said that 
while he had learned in politics that ``you never say never ... let 
me make it very plain, at this point, I have no intention of 
running for the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A possible Pataki Senate run had drawn interest because of his  
chilly relations with New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has 
formed an exploratory committee to prepare for a possible bid for 
the GOP nomination. Also eyeing the race on the Republican side is 
Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island, who joined Pataki for Monday's 
announcement. Giuliani wasn't invited. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the team that was with the governor in 1994,'' Pataki  
spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said when asked about the absence of 
Giuliani, who had crossed party lines that year to endorse 
then-Gov. Mario Cuomo in the governor's race won by Pataki. ``This 
is the team he wanted together, standing there with him when he 
chose to endorse the next president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton is considering a run for the Democratic  
Senate nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki's endorsement of Bush also put an end, at least for the  
moment, on the New York governor's personal presidential ambition. 
He had been traveling the country in recent months seeking to boost 
his national profile. He is still considered a potential GOP vice 
presidential candidate next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush told Pataki, ``I intend to listen to you about more than  
just New York politics. ... The goal is much bigger than the two 
Georges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki assured Bush that ``New Yorkers are never shy or at a  
loss for ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Pataki and the rest of the New York Republican  
establishment came out early for Bob Dole and delivered all of the 
state's 93 national convention delegates to him. But they were 
unable to do the same for him in the general election.

<HEADLINE> Mets Call Up Pitcher Isringhausen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Starting pitcher Bobby Jones was placed on the  
15-day disabled list by the New York Mets on Monday and 
right-hander Jason Isringhausen was called up from the minors and 
thrown right into the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 3-3 with a 5.81 ERA, has a strained right shoulder. He  
was knocked out in the third inning of his last start against 
Philadelphia on Saturday and has not won since April 17. He went on 
the DL effective Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen, who was to start against Pittsburgh on Monday  
night, was pitching in the major leagues for the first time since 
Sept. 23, 1997. He missed last season while recovering from his 
third arm surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, he was 3-1 with a 2.53 ERA in eight starts with  
Norfolk of the International League. He also had 47 strikeouts in 
46 1-3 innings and had allowed only 32 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a standout rookie season in 1995, going 9-2 with a 2.81  
ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, he had surgery on his right shoulder and elbow in  
1996 and the elbow again in January 1998. In between, he broke his 
right wrist and was diagnosed with tuberculosis.

<HEADLINE> `Phantom' Can't Beat the Dinosaurs / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The ``Star Wars'' prequel has nothing to be  
ashamed of when it comes to box office numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' amassed $64.8  
million Friday through Sunday -- well short of the $72.1 million for 
``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' over the Memorial Day weekend in 
1997, according to figures released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Star Wars'' numbers still set records (a five-day gross of  
$105.7 million and $28.5 million on opening day). It also became 
the fastest movie to break the $100 million barrier, in just five 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other big movie opening last weekend was ``The Love  
Letter,'' which had a disappointing $2.7 million for fifth place 
despite being billed as a romantic alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mummy,'' meanwhile, stayed strong enough to also break  
$100 million, collecting $13.8 million to finish second. 
``Entrapment'' was third with $6.3 million and ``The Matrix'' 
fourth with $2.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In art houses, ``Tea With Mussolini'' continued to do well,  
grossing $1.3 million. It dropped only 22 percent in its second 
week.

<HEADLINE> Survey Aims To Improve Minority Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- There is money to be made in reaching minority  
consumers, and Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. and the advertising industry 
are trying to figure out how to make the connection. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G, which challenged advertising agencies last year to offer  
more effective Internet ads, wants the industry to show it can do a 
better job reaching minority customers. Managers at P&AMP;G, one of the 
nation's biggest advertisers with annual spending estimated at more 
than $3 billion, think they are missing some potentially lucrative 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey sponsored by P&AMP;G and the Washington-based American  
Advertising Federation was mailed to advertisers, ad agencies and 
media companies this month. Responses were requested by mid-June. 
Marjorie Valin, spokeswoman for the advertising federation, said 
Monday it is the first survey she is aware of that aims to measure 
the ethnic and racial diversity of advertising industry workplaces 
along with the amount of advertising directed at minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Respondents are being asked about the diversity of their work  
forces, their hiring practices, their multicultural marketing 
efforts and their spending on ads targeted at ethnic audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	A committee headed by Robert Wehling, P&AMP;G's global marketing  
officer, hopes to use the results as a basis to recommend 
strategies for improving multicultural advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaching minority consumers requires more than simply using  
ethnic actors in commercials, said Donna Banks, vice president of 
Cincinnati-based Mycom Advertising, one of Cincinnati's few 
minority-owned advertising agencies. The company develops ad 
campaigns that target ethnic markets for clients, including P&AMP;G. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies are starting to realize that it is important to  
include different segments of the population into their marketing 
plans ... but a lot of people aren't sure how to do it,'' Ms. Banks 
said. ``You have to do more than just run the same commercial you 
would for a white audience and put black people in it. When you're 
trying to design ads specifically for an ethnic market, you have to 
understand that culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, she said, ``you may run the risk of even offending  
the consumers you're trying to reach.''

<HEADLINE> Reaction to Police Privacy Decision </HEADLINE>

<P>
	Reaction to the Supreme Court's unanimous decision Monday that  
said police violate people's privacy rights when they bring the 
news media into homes while they make arrests or conduct searches: 
</P>
<P>
	Richard K. Willard, attorney representing Charles and Geraldine  
Wilson in the Maryland case: ``I'm certainly pleased with the

	Henry H. Rossbacher, lawyer for Paul and Erma Berger in the  
Montana case: ``I'm delighted that the court affirmed the Fourth 
Amendment violation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joshua L. Dratel of the National Association of Criminal Defense  
Lawyers, which supported the Bergers: ``It's clear and there's no 
mistake anymore. ... It's a violation of the Fourth Amendment. ... 
The government is not allowed to make a display of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Spitzer of the American Civil Liberties Union, which  
helped represent the Wilsons: ``This ruling says law enforcement 
officers must be guided by the Fourth Amendment and not by the 
demands of the `infotainment' industry. ... Today the court said 
the Constitution is more important than getting good publicity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Cordray, lawyer for the law enforcement officers in both  
cases: ``They were very sensible and fair rulings. ... The court 
didn't say all media ride-alongs are impermissible.'' The media can

said, adding, ``They just won't be able to go into the home

	Lee Levine, attorney representing The Associated Press, ABC and  
other media which supported the police officers: ``I can't say I'm 
surprised the court's erected this kind of protective cloak around 
the home. ... This is going to cause law enforcement officers to be 
very cautious about allowing the media to ride along in all sorts 
of circumstances. ... It's bad for the public in the sense that the 
public won't get to see through the press' eyes that important 
aspect of the government's work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Kirtley of the Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the  
Press: ``There are going to be situations where it would be 
valuable for members of the press to be present. ... Given the 
pressure on law enforcement ... it's a given that there are going 
to be some people overzealous in carrying out their duties and I 
think it's important that the public see that. ... It's 
unconscionable for the court to say it's always a violation of 
Fourth Amendment rights'' for the media to accompany police into 
private homes.

<HEADLINE> Forced Drugs on Mentally Ill Mulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Robin Simon hears talk of forcing the  
mentally ill to take psychiatric drugs, she remembers the 13 times 
she walked into hospitals only to be confined against her will. 
</P>
<P>
	She was given chemicals designed to treat manic depression,  
personality disorder and alcoholism. Now age 42 and a mental health 
counselor, she worries about proposals to require treatment for 
psychiatric patients who stop taking their medication. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives me a sick feeling in my stomach to think that some  
people could go through what I went through, or even worse,'' Ms. 
Simon says. ``You're taking away their voice to say, `No, I don't 
want to have this.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Others argue that some people must be coerced into treatment to  
help themselves and to protect potential victims. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of recent crimes by mental patients -- two police  
officers killed at the U.S. Capitol, a shooting spree at a Mormon 
library in Salt Lake City, a woman pushed in front of a New York 
subway train -- has set off an emotional debate on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	About 35 states have laws that let judges order patients to take  
anti-psychotic drugs. The outpatient commitment laws are designed 
to help patients who stop taking drugs because of side effects, the 
belief they don't need them or other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of court-ordered care say rare but well-publicized  
violent acts by the mentally ill point to a more urgent problem: an 
underfunded health care system that often loses track of troubled 
patients. They say court-ordered treatment is at best a 
shortsighted fix, at worst a violation of civil liberties. 
</P>
<P>
	People leaving mental hospitals ``are walking out into a void,  
often,'' says Ira Burnim, legal director at the Judge David Bazelon 
Center for Mental Health Law in Washington, D.C. ``You're put on 
meds, you're doing fine, but there's no services available for you 
once you walk out the door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Oliver Sax, a 53-year-old with schizophrenia and depression,  
is grateful authorities forced him into treatment after spending 
several days loitering at New York's Pennsylvania Station two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hanging around in Penn Station... licking the floor,  
literally, at 4 o'clock in the morning,'' he says. ``I know if I'm 
in that kind of position I would require that kind of help. Some 
people need it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea has gained popularity because of recent  
headline-grabbing crimes committed by mental patients off their 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Russell Weston Jr. allegedly killed two police officers  
at the U.S. Capitol after he was discharged from a Montana hospital 
and stopped taking medication. 
</P>
<P>
	And the wife of a 71-year-old man who shot to death two people  
at a Mormon library in Salt Lake City last month said he was not 
taking medicine for schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
	Outpatient commitment is rarely used even in states where it's  
legal, and authorities differ in how they force patients to comply. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has been a hot topic is state legislatures.  
</P>
<P>
	In Maryland, a state task force on outpatient commitment was  
created after a schizophrenic man shot a lawyer in Baltimore. A 
Maine legislative task force rejected outpatient commitment as 
unnecessary in 1997; Nevada did so last year, instead approving 
more money for mental health services. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, where forced hospitalization is the only way to  
mandate treatment, proposals were offered after Andrew Goldstein, a 
schizophrenic who said ghosts inhabited his body, allegedly pushed 
32-year-old Kendra Webdale in front of a subway in January. She was 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents see court orders as a way for families and doctors to  
help patients whose illness clouds their judgment. Kim Webdale, the 
sister of the subway victim, calls court-ordered treatment a way to 
make society safer. 
</P>
<P>
	Even those who get treatment sometimes need help seeing they  
need drugs, says Fred Frese, a Case Western Reserve University 
psychologist who was once forcibly hospitalized for schizophrenia. 
He fears what might have become of him had he not gotten help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably would not be here,'' he says. ``When you go  
protecting someone's right to not be treated, and within a short 
time they go and commit suicide or have some kind of serious 
accident, you're not being responsible.''

<HEADLINE> Hawks Go Out in Four Straight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the end, the Atlanta Hawks simply ran out of  
healthy bodies. And that is not a good thing to happen to a team in 
the run-and-gun NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks went into their second-round playoff series against  
the New York Knicks undermanned, missing LaPhonso Ellis, who has 
been sidelined since mid-March with a hernia, and Alan Henderson, 
suffering from double vision and wearing a patch after being poked 
in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
	This is like an automobile suddenly going from its six-cylinder  
configuration down to four. The pickup is reduced considerably. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the schedule which demanded back-to-back games on  
Sunday and Monday, not a good arrangement in the best of 
circumstances and one that doomed a team playing with a short 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't blame the schedule,'' said Dikembe Mutombo, who  
managed 11 points and took just six shots in Monday night's 79-66 
loss that completed the Knicks' four-game sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those things happen in pro sports. Those are things you have  
to live with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it all seemed to catch up with arm-weary Atlanta which  
missed 15 straight shots in the second half, ending any chance it 
might have had against the deeper Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	That led to two records for shooting futility. In the  
second-round series, the Hawks scored 306 points, the lowest total 
for any NBA team in a four-game playoff. It broke the mark of 323 
set by Cleveland against Indiana last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta made just 101 of 320 field goal attempts, a 31.6  
percentage that broke the record of 32.3 set by the Minneapolis 
Lakers against the Fort Wayne Pistons in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the situation seemed to catch up with Steve Smith,  
who scored 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was frustrated,'' he said. ``We were losing. When you're a  
competitor, you don't want to lose. You don't want to get swept. 
You don't want to lose that way. But you've got to be professional 
about it; calm down a little bit and handle it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It marked the first time in the long coaching career of Lenny  
Wilkens that he has gone out of a best-of-7 series without winning 
at least one game. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkens is a Hall of Fame player and coach, the winningest coach  
in the history of the NBA. But the best bench boss in the world 
still needs some warm bodies to win games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to go against the Knicks if you don't have but six  
people,'' Wilkens said. ``We didn't have the bodies to bang with 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he wasn't about to lean on the injuries as an explanation  
for the Hawks quick elimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were the better team,'' Wilkens said of the Knicks.  
``They were much better than we were. They executed, they ran, they 
defended, they did all the right things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the missing players?  
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have those players going in,'' Wilkens said. ``I'm  
not making excuses. We didn't play well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the injuries had an impact on Atlanta's season even  
before the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we got LaPhonso Ellis into the system, he got  
hurt,'' Wilkens said. ``Then Alan Henderson got hurt and after we 
got him back, he got hurt again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tipoff to the Hawks' problems came in the first playoff  
series against Detroit. They won the first two games at home, each 
by 20 points, but then got blown out in Games 3 and 4 on the road. 
They scored just 63 points in Game 3, their lowest playoff total in 
franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	Uh-oh.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks survived in Game 5, but it turned out to be only a  
temporary reprieve for Wilkens' beat-up basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first series, we did all right,'' Mutombo said. ``The  
second series, it didn't work. We couldn't get our rhythm going. 
It's tough to swallow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The situation was so serious that Atlanta was counting on  
anonymous second-year players like Chris Crawford and Ed Gray to 
rescue them. It worked only briefly. 
</P>
<P>
	Did the Detroit series soften up the Hawks for the Knicks?  
</P>
<P>
	``It may have,'' Wilkens said. ``It's hard to say. Crawford  
separated his shoulder. That's hard. He didn't shoot well after 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither did the rest of the Hawks.

<HEADLINE> Reno To Stay Despite Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno made clear Monday  
that she isn't resigning even though a Clinton administration 
loyalist in the Senate suggested she consider stepping down over 
the handling of allegations of Chinese nuclear espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm right here, going strong,'' she told two reporters who  
encountered her in a Justice Department hallway and asked if she 
was going to leave after her future became a topic on a Sunday 
television talk show. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has weathered periodic calls for her ouster during the past  
two years from a handful of Republicans in Congress angered by her 
refusal to turn her campaign finance investigation over to an 
independent counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, her future was also questioned by a Democrat, Sen.  
Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, who has been a vocal defender of 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' Torricelli said, ``It's  
time for President Clinton to have a conversation with the attorney 
general about her ability to perform her duties and whether or not 
it is in the national interest for her to continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said she had not seen exactly what Torricelli said.  
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight day, White House press secretary Joe  
Lockhart said Clinton ``has confidence in the attorney general and 
will continue to have confidence in her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, with top Justice officials privately expressing  
frustration over her refusal to rebut the attacks on her, Reno 
issued a six-paragraph statement defending the department's 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involves a now-fired Taiwanese-born scientist, Wen Ho  
Lee, who is under investigation for possibly providing nuclear 
secrets to China from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New 
Mexico. Through his lawyer, he has denied spying for China. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee first came under suspicion in 1996 after intelligence  
suggested that the Chinese knew details about the U.S. W-88 nuclear 
missile warhead, which was data to which he had access. The Justice 
Department declined to seek a warrant for electronic surveillance 
of him in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno's statement disclosed that the FBI's 1997 request for a  
surveillance warrant on Lee ``did not contain a request to search 
any computer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Lee's computer was finally searched this spring with his  
permission, FBI agents found he had moved nuclear weapons testing 
data from a secure computer to an unsecure computer in his office. 
Agents are still investigating whether any unauthorized people 
gained access to the data from the unsecure computer. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a senior Justice official, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said the FBI was never informed by the Energy Department 
that Lee had signed a waiver that would have allowed agents to 
search his computer without a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take very seriously the department's responsibility to  
protect the national security,'' Reno's statement said. ``But the 
Justice Department has not -- nor will it -- authorize such 
intrusions when, as in this case, the standards of the Constitution 
and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act have not been met.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said career Justice lawyers rejected the FBI's warrant  
application. ``Although I was not apprised of the details of the 
case at the time the decision was made, I have reviewed the 
decision ... and fully support it,'' Reno wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said FBI Director Louis Freeh ``firmly believes that the  
decision in this case was based on a principled analysis of the law 
and the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A senior FBI official, requesting anonymity, has said, ``We  
didn't have any real evidence of espionage. All we knew was the 
Energy Department put him on a list of people who had access to 
this information and he had made a trip to China to give a 
lecture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To get a warrant, the act requires probable cause to believe a  
citizen is knowingly engaged in clandestine intelligence-gathering 
for a foreign power. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has named a senior career prosecutor to review of how the  
Lee case was handled back to 1982, the first time his name ever 
came to the FBI's attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice officials said these decisions are not a major topic in  
the China espionage report due out Tuesday from a special House 
panel chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif. The report details 
how the Chinese stole or otherwise obtained satellite and nuclear 
secrets over the past two decades.

	NATO Pounds Yugoslavia's Power Grids

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO hammered at Serbian power  
plants today as the bombing campaign entered its third month. Much 
of the capital remains without electricity, and the water supply is 
said to be dangerously low. Ten strong explosions rocked 
Yugoslavia's second-biggest city Novi Sad in the area of a refinery 
and power station, and Serb media also reported attacks on other 
targets. Meanwhile, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said there 
is evidence that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is

	Schools May Be Liable in Harassment

harassing each other. The decision sprung from the case of a 
fifth-grade girl who complained about a classmate. The court ruled

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today ruled that the Federal  
Trade Commission has the authority to regulate at least some 
nonprofit professional groups in an effort to protect competition. 
But the justices ordered lower courts to take a closer look to 
determine whether the FTC properly invalidated the California 
Dental Association's limits on dentist advertising. Federal law 
gives the FTC authority over any company or association ``organized 
to carry on business for its own profit or that of its members.'' 
The FTC said that includes the nonprofit dental association because 
its goal is to ensure that its members make money.

what went wrong when a popular wrestler was killed last night in an 
accident prior to a match. Owen Hart, also known as the ``Blue 
Blazer,'' plunged 50 feet into the ring as he was being lowered in 
a pre-fight stunt. Some witnesses say his cable snapped during the 
stunt, others think Hart became disconnected from the cable. ``From 
the information we have so far, it had something to do with the

35-mile long slick off Malaysia's west coast with chemicals to help 
dissolve it. Environmental officials say the slick, caused by fuel 
seeping from the cruise ship that sank Friday, is 12 miles long and 
growing. The Sun Vista was sailing through the Straits of Malacca 
from the Thai island of Phuket to Singapore when a fire broke out. 
The vessel, with 1,093 passengers and crew aboard, was evacuated

chemical engineer from New Jersey, set out on his quest May 12 with 
two other men. The climb was only supposed to take a week, but the

	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Mike Tyson was released today from a  
Maryland jail after serving 3 1/2 months on a one-year assault 
sentence. The former heavyweight champion was released based on an 
Indiana judge's decision to end his probation for a 1992 rape 
conviction. Tyson was granted parole in Maryland on Friday. But 
Indiana needed to approve the release before Tyson could go home 
for the first time since he was sentenced Feb. 5.

<HEADLINE> Charges Filed Against Shriver Aide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A personal assistant to Eunice Kennedy  
Shriver was in jail Monday on charges he used a computer in her 
home to e-mail child pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Jared Pearl, 39, of Potomac, Md., was arrested Friday as  
he stepped off a plane with plans to visit a 12-year-old girl he 
met through an Internet chat line, according to a federal complaint 
filed Monday. The girl actually was an adult Customs Service 
informant. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shriver is a sister of the late President John F. Kennedy  
and mother of NBC News' Maria Shriver. Pearl, who had worked for 
the Shrivers since October, was fired after the family learned of 
the allegations, Kennedy family spokesman Robert Corcoran said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearl allegedly wrote sexually explicit messages and transmitted  
pictures depicting adult-child sexual relations. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint said Pearl claimed to live in Mrs. Shriver's home,  
but Corcoran would not say whether that was true. 
</P>
<P>
	In federal court Monday, Pearl asked for a lawyer to be  
appointed for him.

<HEADLINE> Dentist Loses Appeal in HIV Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court rejected an appeal Monday by  
a Maine dentist who was sued for refusing to treat a woman in his 
office because she had the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	The court turned away without comment Randon Bragdon's  
contention that filling a cavity in Sidney Abbott's tooth at his 
office would have posed a ``direct threat'' to his health and 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower courts rejected the claim and ruled for Abbott without  
even holding trials on her claims of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Monday's action was not a ruling and set no national  
precedent, it was praised by gay-rights advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the final chapter in a long history of this case,  
which established that health-care providers cannot refuse critical 
services to patients with HIV based upon unscientific beliefs about 
HIV transmission,'' said Bennett Klein of the Boston-based Gay &AMP; 
Lesbian Advocates &AMP; Defenders. 
</P>
<P>
	He served as one of Abbott's lawyers.  
</P>
<P>
	Bragdon had urged the nation's highest court to use the case to  
clarify when disabled people can be treated differently under a 
federal anti-prejudice law, the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The ADA protects the disabled against discrimination in jobs,  
housing and public accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
	The same Maine dispute was the subject of a major Supreme Court  
decision just last June, when the justices said people infected 
with HIV can sue under that 1990 law. 
</P>
<P>
	That decision was the court's first ever involving the human  
immunodeficiency virus that causes acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome. It was praised by gay rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
	In returning the Maine case to a federal appeals court, the  
justices said then that a health-care provider's actions should be 
judged according to ``the objective reasonableness of the views of 
health-care professionals without deferring to their individual 
judgments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Public health authorities say there is no documented case of a  
dentist contracting the AIDS virus from a patient. Bragdon 
contended he should be allowed to use his own judgment on how to 
safely treat such patients. He had offered to fill Abbott's cavity 
at a hospital near his office, but the procedure would have cost 
more there. 
</P>
<P>
	When the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals restudied the case,  
it ruled in December that Abbott's legal victory in the 
discrimination case should stand and that no trial was necessary. 
She had won a judgment saying Bragdon should stop discriminating 
but received no monetary award.

<HEADLINE> Forsberg, Lemieux Playing Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Peter Forsberg and Claude Lemieux were playing  
pretty well without Valeri Kamensky. With him, they've been 
unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Avalanche are 5-0 since Kamensky's return from a  
two-month layoff caused by a broken arm. It's no coincidence, 
either, as Kamensky has provided six points and linemates Forsberg 
and Lemieux have stepped up their production. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamensky continued his strong play Saturday night, assisting on  
one goal and scoring the winner as the Avalanche opened the Western 
Conference finals with a 2-1 victory over the Dallas Stars. He also 
had a possible goal nullified on replay. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 of the best-of-7 series is tonight.  
</P>
<P>
	``Val's a great skater,'' Lemieux said. ``When he uses his feet,  
he's a force out there. I knew it wouldn't take any time for him to 
jump in and help out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without Kamensky, Colorado eliminated San Jose 4-2 in the first  
round and was down 0-2 to Detroit in the second round. Over those 
eight games, Forsberg had nine points and Lemieux had five. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 33-year-old Russian rejoined the Avalanche's top line,  
they won four straight from Detroit to knock out the two-time 
defending champion Red Wings and got the early jump on the 
top-ranked Stars in the conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	In that five-game stretch, Colorado has outscored opponents  
21-8. Kamensky has two goals and four assists, Forsberg has 10 
points, two in each game, and Lemieux has seven. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's bringing a new dimension to our offense,'' coach Bob  
Hartley said. ``He generates a lot defensively with his speed and 
his skill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After missing 23 games because of the injury, Kamensky had an  
assist in his first game back and scored a goal the next game. He 
had two assists in the series finale against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamensky appeared to have jump-started the Avalanche again  
midway through the second period Saturday night by redirecting a 
shot by Lemieux under Dallas goaltender Ed Belfour. 
</P>
<P>
	The red light didn't go on, but Kamensky and teammates began  
celebrating what they thought was a tying goal. 
</P>
<P>
	On-ice officials weren't sure whether the pole stopped the puck  
or if it was prevented from crossing the goal line by a pad at the 
base of the net that went too close to the post. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the puck never crossed the line,'' Lemieux said, ``but  
it couldn't because of that padding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would've been a goal if the stuffing was in the way. Judges  
decided replays were inconclusive, so they couldn't award Colorado 
the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the puck go in,'' Kamensky said. ``I think it's a  
goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten minutes later, Colorado made it 1-1 on Forsberg's  
playoff-leading seventh goal. He flicked in the rebound of a shot 
by Kamensky that Belfour had blocked. 
</P>
<P>
	The roles were reversed on the winning goal, with Kamensky  
knocking in his own rebound of Forsberg's miss with 5:58 left in 
regulation. Unlike the waved-off goal, Kamensky had no idea what 
happened on this play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw lots of sticks,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The victory was Colorado's seventh straight on the road in the  
playoffs. Dallas had won its first five home playoff games and nine 
straight at Reunion Arena counting the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The top-seeded Stars are down in a series for the first time  
since Detroit took a 2-1 lead in last year's Western Conference 
finals. The Red Wings won in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the Stars' eight victories this postseason have come  
when they were down in the third period and they made quite a run 
at it after Kamensky's goal. But Avalanche goalie Patrick Roy was 
at his best in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to get in front of the net and then we've got to  
keep firing away,'' Dallas defenseman Darryl Sydor said. ``We had 
chances at the end, but we didn't get second and third whacks at 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers Went for Crown, Came Up Short </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The company line is, ``Look at  
everything that happened to us, all the changes, all the 
distractions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line is, the Los Angeles Lakers flamed out.  
</P>
<P>
	Again.  
</P>
<P>
	The team of the '80s has been anything but the team of the '90s.  
</P>
<P>
	Headed by Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Glen Rice, there  
might be enough talent for the Lakers to win a championship one of 
these years, something that hasn't happened since 1988 and the days 
of Magic, Kareem and Showtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Something's missing, that's for sure.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were as volatile as the ground under LA, there's no telling  
when it would start to shake again,'' forward Rick Fox said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have high expectations and it ends like this,  
everybody's disappointed,'' guard Derek Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating,'' Rice said. ``We could have gotten a lot  
further than what we did. I think what has to happen now is we have 
to learn from our mistakes and be a smarter team next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers held a brief team meeting a day after losing their  
fourth straight game to the San Antonio Spurs in the Western 
Conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers were also swept out of the playoffs last spring, by  
Utah in the conference finals. As was the case last year, O'Neal 
didn't attend the team's final get-together. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither did rookie Tyronn Lue, but he had informed management  
late Sunday he would be attending a funeral instead. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal made clear his embarrassment and disappointment after  
Sunday's 118-107 loss to the Spurs, and perhaps will consider 
exercising a clause in his contract that could make him a free 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, he has three years remaining on the contract he  
signed in July 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, he's frustrated, as he was frustrated last year,''  
Jerry West, the Lakers' executive vice president of basketball 
operations, said of O'Neal. ``The one thing I will tell him is this 
is the place he should end his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a player who can win us a championship if we can get the  
right people around him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers certainly tried that this year. For whatever reason,  
it didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
	When the team reported to an abridged training camp in late  
January, there were nine returnees from the previous season along 
with three rookies and two newcomers -- veteran point guard Derek 
Harper and forward Travis Knight, who had returned after one year 
in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, coach Del Harris and his staff were back intact.  
</P>
<P>
	In addressing reporters Monday, West lamented the fact that  
there wasn't a full training camp, but the changes and distractions 
didn't begin until later. 
</P>
<P>
	First, of course, there was the Dennis Rodman saga. The  
seven-time NBA rebounding champion finally signed with the team 
Feb. 23 after nearly three weeks of consideration and near-daily 
updates. 
</P>
<P>
	On the night Rodman signed, the Lakers lost their third straight  
game to fall to 6-6, and Harris was fired the following day. He 
would be replaced two days after that by assistant Kurt Rambis, who 
was hired for the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later, the Lakers completed a long rumored trade with  
Charlotte, acquiring Rice and J.R. Reid for Eddie Jones and Elden 
Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's erratic behavior began just after the big trade, and  
continued until he was waived on April 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to beat Dennis up,'' Harper said. ``I don't  
think it's fair to make Dennis the scapegoat. He was late a lot. I 
don't think that was a good example. I can truly say he was 
committed to winning while he was here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice had his ups-and-downs, and acknowledged personal  
frustration on many occasions, claiming he wasn't be used 
correctly. 
</P>
<P>
	He scored 40 points to lead the Lakers to their fourth straight  
win in the regular-season finale, and 29 in the first game of the 
playoffs. After that, his offensive opportunities and productivity 
diminished. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis, whose future is uncertain, said Monday he considered the  
season successful despite the disappointing finish, and expects to 
return as coach next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to having a good training camp next year  
and being able to put my mark on the team,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	West said he hoped to be able to announce a decision on Rambis'  
status in a few weeks. Previously, on several occasions, West 
praised the job done by Rambis, especially considering the 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have some internal talks,'' West said. ``You really  
can't evaluate him fairly. He was put in a most awkward position. 
</P>
<P>
	``At times, we weren't very cohesive at all. At other times, we  
played beautifully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West, who wondered openly about his own future recently, said he  
intends and hopes to complete the four-year contract extension he 
signed last September. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some work that needs to be done,'' West said. ``We  
don't have a terrible basketball team here, fellas. We're competing 
against our past success. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in this shortened season, we tried to push the  
envelope a little bit, we wanted to win a championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For whatever reason, they didn't come close.

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya Wants Trinidad in Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya can't wait to get Felix  
Trinidad into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	He should get his way Sept. 18, assuming Trinidad does a little  
work with both his gloves and a pen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's get it on,'' De La Hoya said. ``It will be the fight of  
the century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After finding out his hand was merely sprained and not more  
seriously injured during Saturday night's win over Oba Carr, De La 
Hoya will get some time to rest and recuperate before beginning 
training for the megafight that will earn him $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	About all that remains in the way of the clash of welterweight  
champions is Trinidad winning his IBF title fight next Saturday 
against Hugo Pineda and officially signing a contract that his 
promoter, Don King, has already agreed to. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fight is on,'' promoter Bob Arum said Sunday. ``The fight  
will happen, assuming Trinidad wins his fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya stopped Carr in the 11th round to retain his WBC  
welterweight title, but caused Arum some tense moments until X-rays 
at a hospital after the fight showed the left hand wasn't badly 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya's hand was put in a splint, and he will not be able  
to use it for four weeks. But his doctor said it will be healed in 
plenty of time to begin training for the Trinidad fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll be just fine,'' said Dr. Tony Daly, an  
orthopedic surgeon. ``It's a sprain in the base of the hand, not 
really in the wrist. It's pretty common in boxers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said De La Hoya injured the hand early in the second round  
while throwing a jab. He said it caused him pain the rest of the 
fight when he tried to jab, but did not bother him when he threw 
left hooks. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a left hook that floored Carr early in the 11th round,  
ending a fight that did not showcase De La Hoya at his best against 
the fourth-ranked contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr, also knocked down in the first round, got up at the count  
of three, but referee Richard Steele waved the fight to a close 
without protest from the dazed fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get hit with a shot like that, your head can't do  
nothing but be a little shaky,'' Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya was winning easily at the time on all three  
scorecards. But, aside from the first-round knockdown, he had done 
little to back his prefight promise to stand and trade punches with 
any fighter who gets in the ring with him. 
</P>
<P>
	While De La Hoya did enough to make sure the fight with Trinidad  
comes off, Trinidad's, King will have to settle some differences 
with the fighter's father before finally getting a signature on the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Felix Trinidad, Sr., said in Puerto Rico that the fighter will  
not sign until King forks over some of the extra $500,000 he 
negotiated from Arum this week for the fight. As it now stands, 
Trinidad would get $8 million and King $2.5. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum, though, said he had King's word the fight would happen,  
and said Trinidad would never risk the huge payday over a 
relatively small amount. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is that crazy,'' Arum said. ``Don will handle it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Carr, who has fought both fighters, said it would be tough to  
pick a winner. But he said he favored De La Hoya because he takes a 
punch better. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're both astronomical fighters. The tougher warrior will  
prevail,'' said Carr, who knocked down Trinidad in their December 
1994 fight before being stopped in the eighth round. ``Both of them 
are quick and both of them are powerful. But I think Oscar takes a 
better punch.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Schedules 64 Exhibition Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The return of the Cleveland Browns and the  
return of instant replay will mark the opening weekend of the NFL 
64-game exhibition season, beginning Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns, now an expansion team but wearing their old brown,  
orange and white colors, will mark their return against the Dallas 
Cowboys Monday night, Aug. 9, in the nationally televised Hall of 
Fame game at Canton, Ohio. It is the first time the Hall of Fame 
game to be played on a Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns were the home team for the first Monday night game  
ever in 1970, beating the New York Jets 31-21. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibition season begins with the two-time Super Bowl  
champions, the Denver Broncos, meeting the San Diego Chargers in 
the American Bowl at Sydney, Australia, plus Indianapolis at 
Chicago and Oakland at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver also will face the Green Bay Packers, their opponents in  
the 1998 Super Bowl, at Madison, Wis., Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Two stadiums will debut this summer. The Browns will open the  
new 69,000-seat Cleveland Stadium Aug. 21 against the Minnesota 
Vikings, and on Aug. 27, the Tennessee Titans will debut in their 
67,000-seat stadium in Nashville against the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	Instant replay will be used in 63 of the exhibition games, the  
exception being the game in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 11 exhibition games will be nationally televised,

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jeff Van Gundy received an apology but no  
assurances Monday from the president of the New York Knicks, who 
was caught lying about the team's interest in former Bulls coach

</P>
<P>
	``I regret that I lied about it,'' said Dave Checketts, who  
denied for two days that he had met with Jackson before abruptly 
changing his story Sunday during the second half of Game 3 in the 
Hawks-Knicks series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks held a 3-0 lead heading into Monday night's Game 4.  
</P>
<P>
	A victory would put them into the Eastern Conference finals for  
the first time since 1994, but even that might not be enough to 
save Van Gundy's job. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to make decisions about anything -- players to  
trade, who stays, who goes or the status of the coaches -- until 
after the season is over and we've had a chance to review. That 
status hasn't changed,'' Checketts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not fair to make an evaluation on somebody or a judgment  
on what should happen in the organization based on one series, one 
shot or one win,'' Checketts said. ``He (Van Gundy) has agreed to 
that and he's comfortable with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy had little to say on the matter before the game,  
keeping his comments geared toward the immediate task at hand -- 
beating Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	After Sunday's victory, Van Gundy said he believed Checketts  
when the team president told him there had been no contact with 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday afternoon, however, Checketts was in the coach's  
office apologizing. 
</P>
<P>
	``For misleading Jeff I feel deeply sorry, and I told him  
that,'' Checketts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy is in his fourth season as coach of the Knicks, the  
team he has spent more than a decade with as an assistant and head 
coach. Van Gundy, with a career record of 140-97 including 20-16 in 
the playoffs, has one year remaining on a three-year, $6 million 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson has been on a sabbatical since leading the Bulls to  
their sixth title of the decade last June. Checketts said he met 
with Jackson for about two hours in mid-April when the Knicks were 
21-21 and in danger of missing the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the meeting came out over the weekend, and Checketts  
denied everything before coming clean. 
</P>
<P>
	``We met for a couple of hours, and there were no offers  
exchanged,'' Checketts said. ``There was nothing that came out of 
the meeting other than getting acquainted with a guy who I felt was 
a tremendous option for us if we had not made the playoffs and 
needed a new direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, what I did is err on the side of protecting  
everyone. I had to do the job of finding out if I had an option 
like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden, has been  
running the Knicks on a day-to-day basis since general manager 
Ernie Grunfeld was demoted in mid-April because of a rift between 
him and Van Gundy. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts said he has been contacted by numerous people around  
the league interested in taking over as coach or general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Ewing, who has been with the Knicks for 14 seasons, said  
he would demand a trade if Jackson was hired. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patrick has a right to say whatever he wants,'' Checketts  
said. ``We'll make decisions regarding the organization in the 
summertime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the unanswered questions surrounding the  
Checketts-Jackson meeting is who set it up. Checketts said he 
contacted Jackson through an intermediary, but he refused to say 
who it was. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Wyche, a spokesman for presidential candidate Bill Bradley,  
said the former Knicks forward was not the intermediary.

<HEADLINE> Merck Hopes New Pill Will Ease Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP)-- Merck &AMP; Co. made a $5.2 billion profit last year  
on nearly $27 billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	But the future of the nation's largest drugmaker is uncertain as  
four of its blockbuster drugs lose patent protection in the next 
two years, which make them susceptible to competition from cheaper 
generics. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why analysts say Merck desperately needs strong sales  
from its new pain pill Vioxx, which was approved Friday by the Food 
and Drug Administration and is expected to reach pharmacies in 
mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	Vioxx, though, will have to compete with another new painkiller,  
Celebrex, which has been the hottest selling drug of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have written 4.4 million prescriptions for Celebrex,  
jointly marketed by Monsanto and Pfizer, since it was launched in 
early January. Celebrex this spring became the second fastest 
selling new drug ever, after the anti-impotence pill Viagra. 
</P>
<P>
	Vioxx and Celebrex are in a new class of drugs known as COX-2  
inhibitors. They offer the same pain relief as traditional 
arthritis drugs but cause fewer side effects, especially ulcers and 
intestinal bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Merck and Monsanto have touted tests showing fewer side  
effects on their drugs, the FDA has ordered both to place standard 
warnings about the potential for stomach problems on their labels. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck won a slight marketing edge Friday as the FDA approved  
Vioxx for menstrual pain, acute pain in adults and osteoarthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex is also approved for osteoarthritis, which is the wear  
and tear of joints usually linked with aging, as well as for 
rheumatoid arthritis, in which the body's immune system backfires 
to cause pain and inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the FDA approves a drug for one disease, doctors can  
prescribe it for other ailments. As a result, analysts say it is 
likely doctors will use Vioxx and Celebrex interchangeably. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle between the drugs will take place in physician  
offices as thousands of pharmaceutical sales representatives prod 
doctors to give out free samples. Heavy consumer advertising should 
also start later this year. Both drugs also will battle to gain 
acceptance from managed care companies, which increasingly restrict 
pharmaceutical coverage. Celebrex is covered by about half of all 
health maintenance organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect both drugs to each eventually surpass $2 billion  
in annual sales by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	For Merck, $2 billion will merely replace sales lost from the  
hypertension drug Vasotec and ulcer drug Pepsid, both of which lose 
U.S. patent protection next year. Merck's cholesterol drug Mevacor 
and hypertension drug Prinivil lose patent protection in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor putting pressure on Merck is that sales growth  
has slowed for its top-selling drug, the cholesterol pill Zocor. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck officials play down their reliance on Vioxx. ``We have a  
lot of products,'' said Wendy Dixon, Merck's vice president of 
marketing. ``Vioxx is clearly important to us, but we are by no 
means dependent on the success of Vioxx.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts see it differently.  
</P>
<P>
	Merck is ``extremely dependent'' on Vioxx's success, said Neil  
Sweig, an analyst with Southeast Research Partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck hopes to persuade doctors to prescribe Vioxx, by showing  
results of a yearlong study compared to just three months of data 
for Celebrex. Additionally, Merck's label will highlight that just 
4 out of 3,300 patients studied on Vioxx suffered serious 
gastrointestinal problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think Merck will be able to do some damage with those  
numbers,'' said Alex Zisson, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety of the drugs will only become clear in the months  
ahead as the drugs are used by hundreds of thousands of patients 
compared to the few thousand patients which took part in the drugs' 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck officials also hope to convince doctors and patients that  
Vioxx is a true once a day pill. They note that a significant 
number of Celebrex users must take the pill twice a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto said most osteoarthritis patients take Celebrex once a  
day. 
</P>
<P>
	The average wholesale price for Vioxx and Celebrex is $2.02 for  
the standard dosage. 
</P>
<P>
	Both drugs are expected to take market share away from cheaper  
arthritis medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
or NSAIDs, and ibuprofen.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Get Suns' First-Round Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Bulls, who have the No. 1 overall  
pick in this year's NBA draft, on Monday received one of the 
Phoenix Suns' two first-round picks. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal earlier this season that sent center Luc Longley to the  
Suns for Mark Bryant, Martin Muursepp and Bubba Wells, included the 
stipulation that the Bulls would get the worst of Phoenix's two 
first-round draft picks this year or the Suns' first-round pick in 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix was to pick ninth and 16th in this year's draft. The  
Bulls will now pick 16th. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls, who won six titles in eight years and then became a  
laughingstock this year without Michael Jordan and company, scored 
their biggest victory of the post-Jordan era when they won the NBA 
draft lottery on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulls general manager Jerry Krause has refused to speculate on  
whom the Bulls would take in the draft on June 30 in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Most experts say there isn't a can't-miss player in the draft,  
but there are a couple of exciting underclassmen in Lamar Odom of 
Rhode Island, Corey Maggette of Duke and Steve Francis of Maryland.

<HEADLINE> Japan Trade Surplus Falls in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's trade surplus with the world slipped 12.6  
percent in April from the same month last year in an indication 
that growth in the imbalance may be slowing, the government said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The merchandise trade surplus, the measure of all goods exported  
by Japan minus those imported, decreased to 1.069 trillion yen, or 
$8.62 billion, the Finance Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The April surplus was slightly lower than the average forecast  
of 1.099 trillion yen by Tokyo-based economists. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United  
States edged up 2.1 percent to 596.50 billion yen, or $4.59 
billion, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan, fighting its worst recession in 50 years, has been under  
heavy pressure from the United States and other trading partners to 
rein in the surplus by bolstering its weak economy to spark demand 
for imports. 
</P>
<P>
	A ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
that the ``general tendency seems to be that surplus growth is 
slowing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's trade surplus had consistently grown more than 20  
percent on year for a string of months until last October. After 
that trend was broken by a 16.2 percent drop in November, the 
surplus has since alternated back and forth between falls and 
rises. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade surplus in March, the last month of the fiscal year,  
increased 7.5 percent from the same month last year. That figure 
followed a 32.2 percent decrease in February. 
</P>
<P>
	In fiscal 1998, Japan's overall trade surplus rose 23 percent  
from the previous year to reach the second highest total ever 
recorded.

<HEADLINE> Aguilera Hopes To Save Cubs' Pen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Finding Wrigley Field was no problem for Rick  
Aguilera. In fact, he had more trouble locating the bathroom in his 
new home clubhouse than he did driving to work. All part of a 
fitting-in process Monday for the Chicago Cubs' new closer. 
</P>
<P>
	Just the sight of the tall, goateed Aguilera is a relief for a  
team whose bullpen has blown 11 of 22 save chances this season and 
whose intended closer, Rod Beck, struggled greatly before 
undergoing elbow surgery last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sends a surge of energy though our clubhouse,'' Cubs  
manager Jim Riggleman said before Monday's game with Florida. 
``It's been uplifting for the club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aguilera wanted to stay with the Minnesota Twins and finish his  
career as a closer. But when trade rumors began before spring 
training, he did some checking and after talking with Chicago 
starter Kevin Tapani, one of his best friends, he eventually 
designated the Cubs as a team he'd join. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked what the team was like and I said it was like the  
team we had in Minnesota in the early 90s,'' Tapani said. ``Guys 
who play hard, get along and are winners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aguilera's reasons for choosing Chicago, he said, were numerous:  
Some of his former teammates included Tapani, Gary Gaetti, reliever 
Dan Serafini and even team GM Ed Lynch from his days with the New 
York Mets. He also called Wrigley Field his favorite park in the 
majors. And he and Tapani's family are extremely close. 
</P>
<P>
	After earlier waiving a no-trade clause, Aguilera was dealt to  
Chicago last week along with Scott Downs for minor league pitchers 
Jason Ryan and Kyle Lohse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not coming here to replace Rod and I'm not coming here  
saying I have to close,'' Aguilera said. ``I told Riggs I came here 
to do whatever I can to help. I hope I'm not expected to come here 
and save every game because I'm not. I'm going to have bad days 
like everybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aguilera, 37, is 19 saves shy of 300 and had a 1.27 ERA with a  
3-1 record and six saves when he left the Twins. He's pitched one 
inning so far with the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	A closer's life can change in a hurry. With one pitch.  
</P>
<P>
	After saving 51 games last season, Beck blew four saves in 11  
chances, had a 10.54 ERA and was 2-4, bringing out the boos birds. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife mentioned that, that they've really been getting on  
Rod Beck after the kind of season he had last year,'' Aguilera 
said. ``I played in New York where there are serious fans and it's 
something I can't control. I hope to pitch well and contribute. If 
that doesn't seem to materialize and I'm booed, we'll have to get 
through that. We'll see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aguilera is also well aware that Beck, who underwent  
arthroscopic surgery, is expected to return before the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally I hope nothing is going to create a conflict  
personally between him and me,'' Aguilera said. ``I hope he is back 
as quickly as he can be and we can work together out of the 
bullpen, however Jim wants to work the bullpen.''

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Sign Leetch to Big Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Brian Leetch is staying with the New York  
Rangers with a new, beefed up contract that reportedly will make 
him the highest paid defenseman in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers made the announcement at a news conference Monday,  
but declined to discuss terms of the deal in which Leetch's 
reported annual salary of $8.75 million would make him best paid 
player in team history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you, and it may not show outwardly, I'm very  
excited to stay in New York,'' Leetch said at the news conference. 
``My family and friends are excited. They love coming to the 
Garden, they love everything about New York, they love rooting for 
the Rangers. This is a great day for me and my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been reports for weeks that Leetch will get $35  
million over four years. 
</P>
<P>
	It was either that or lose him to free agency.  
</P>
<P>
	Several teams were interested in Leetch, who has won the Norris  
Trophy as the NHL's top defenseman two times and generally regarded 
as one of the best players in the game for 12 years. Had he decided 
to test the free-agent market, there was speculation he could 
become hockey's first $10 million-a-year player. 
</P>
<P>
	With the retirement of Wayne Gretzky, and the Rangers having  
missed the playoffs for a second year in a row, it became critical 
for the team to sign Leetch, their captain and highest profile 
player along with goaltender Mike Richter. Richter is currently 
under a long-term contract signed last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud to say we've signed the guy who is the foundation of  
the franchise,'' Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts 
said. ``The first item on the agenda was to sign Brian Leetch. We 
made this a priority and now it's done and congratulations to 
(Rangers general manager) Neil (Smith) and to Brian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Re-signing Leetch will go a long way toward restoring the  
Rangers' credibility in the NHL and perhaps help in their search 
for some fresh free-agent talent to get them back in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those expected to be available when the free-agent market  
opens on July 1 are Colorado's Theo Fleury and San Jose's Vincent 
Damphousse. 
</P>
<P>
	Leetch is third on the Rangers' career scoring list with 177  
goals and 578 assists for 755 points -- leading all defensemen in 
the team's history. This past season, Leetch totaled 55 points -- 
fifth among NHL defensemen. 
</P>
<P>
	Leetch had said all along that he wanted to continue playing in  
New York. He has been one of the Rangers' top players since joining 
them after the 1988 Olympics, and played a starring role when the 
Rangers won the Stanley Cup in 1994. That year, Leetch won the Conn 
Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Leetch has been a star in the NHL since beginning his career in  
New York 12 seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``To stay in one place for your career is something to take  
pride in,'' Leetch said. ``I've got enough money to last myself and 
my family a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He won the Calder Trophy as the league's rookie of the year in  
1988-89 and then two Norris Trophies as the league's top 
defenseman, in 1992 and 1997. It was also in 1992 and 1997 that 
Leetch was voted onto the NHL's first all-star team. In addition, 
Leetch at the age of 31 has already played in seven All-Star Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1991-92 season, he pulled off a rarity for a defenseman  
when he reached the 100-point mark.

	Report: China has US 'Front' Cos.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China secretly controls several thousand  
American ``front companies'' to obtain U.S. technology for military 
purposes, a congressional report says. It's part of a 700-page 
document to be issued tomorrow by a special House committee 
investigating espionage and U.S. technology losses to China, 
officials familiar with the report said today. The report describes 
a ``blurring of commerce and intelligence operations'' by China 
that poses an unprecedented challenge to U.S. efforts to keep its 
military-related secrets, said congressional sources. Problems with 
lax security at U.S. weapons labs are also described in the report.

Congress angered by her refusal to turn her campaign finance

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 today that schools  
can be sued when officials fail to stop students from sexually 
harassing each other. Schools -- from elementary to college -- that 
accept federal money can be forced to pay victims of such 
harassment. The court also decided that police who let the news 
media accompany them into people's homes to observe arrests or 
searches can be sued for violating the Constitution's Fourth 
Amendment protection against unreasonable searches. It also turned 
down an appeal by a Maine dentist who was sued for refusing to 
treat a woman in his office because she has the virus that causes 
AIDS.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Hitting power plants and airfields  
again, NATO said today there were signs Yugoslav strongman Slobodan 
Milosevic was ``cracking'' after two months of airstrikes. A U.N. 
team, meanwhile, found the humanitarian situation worse than 
expected in Kosovo. Visits to more than seven Kosovo towns over 
three days showed conditions in the province to be ``a lot worse 
than we feared,'' said Sergio de Mello, head of the U.N. 
fact-finding mission. ``Everything indicates that there is an 
attempt to displace, ethnically cleanse Kosovo,'' he said, calling 
the scale of the refugee crisis ``gigantic.''

<HEADLINE> Court: Ride-Alongs Violate Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police violate people's privacy rights when  
they bring TV camera crews or other journalists into homes during 
arrests or searches, the Supreme Court ruled Monday in a pair of 
decisions that could put a crimp in popular true-life TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Police who carry out such media ``ride-alongs'' can be sued for  
violating the Constitution's Fourth Amendment ban on unreasonable 
searches and seizures, the court said in the two unanimous rulings. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court in  
cases from Maryland and Montana, cited the ``centuries-old 
principle of respect for the privacy of the home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Surely the possibility of good public relations for the police  
is simply not enough, standing alone, to justify the ride-along 
intrusion into a private home,'' Rehnquist wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even the need for accurate reporting on police issues in  
general'' does not justify allowing journalists to accompany police 
onto private property, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union said the ruling means police  
must be guided by the Fourth Amendment, not by the demands of the 
``infotainment'' industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government is not allowed to make a display of you,''  
added Joshua Dratel of the National Association of Criminal Defense 
Lawyers. The group supported a Montana couple who sued after 
government agents brought along a CNN camera crew while conducting 
a raid on their ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	The rulings still will allow media to accompany police officers  
as long as the journalists stay outside when officers enter private 
homes, said attorney Richard Cordray, who represented the police 
officers in both cases. 
</P>
<P>
	But attorney Lee Levine, representing The Associated Press and  
other news organizations who sided with law enforcement officers, 
said the rulings may discourage police from allowing the media to 
accompany them even for permissible purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bad for the public in the sense that the public won't get  
to see, through the press' eyes, that important aspect of the 
government's work,'' Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Milton Coleman, deputy managing editor of The Washington Post,  
stressed that the ruling concerns people's homes and does not 
restrict reporters' right to join police officers at work, or 
photographers' right to shoot pictures in public places. The Post 
was involved in one of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up until now the law in the area has not been clearly  
established,'' he said. ``We are encouraged that the court 
recognizes the important purpose that is served by the media role 
in providing the public accurate coverage of police activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A CNN spokeswoman, Sue Binford, said, ``We are studying how the  
ruling might apply to our case, which is still pending. We will 
reserve any comment until the appropriate time in our litigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Langley, producer of the Fox television show ``COPS'' said  
Monday it will be ``business as usual'' for the program because it 
``routinely obtains permission when filming on private property and 
also obtains releases from everyone involved in the program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But police departments said the ruling has reinforced a move  
toward limits on filming and could lead to more. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene is repeated countless times daily across America:  
Police officers burst into a house or some other private place in 
search of a quarry. A court-issued warrant or emergency 
circumstances give police that authority, but the justices said 
bringing along outsiders is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that holding, the justices ruled 8-1 that the police  
officers in the two cases cannot be sued because it was not 
``clearly established'' in 1992 and 1993 -- when the raids occurred 
-- that such access was unlawful. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Maryland case, Montgomery County sheriff's deputies and  
deputy U.S. marshals took along a Washington Post reporter and 
photographer when they entered Charles and Geraldine Wilson's home 
in Rockville early one morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers wanted to arrest the Wilsons' fugitive adult son,  
who was not at their home but turned himself in later at his 
parents' urging. The photographs, one showing Wilson wearing only 
his undershorts with a police officer's gun at his head, were not 
published. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the Wilsons'  
lawsuit against the officers, and the Supreme Court upheld that 
dismissal. However, the Wilsons also are pursuing a separate 
lawsuit against the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montana case was filed by Paul and Erma Berger against  
federal agents and a prosecutor who let a CNN reporter and camera 
crew accompany them to the couple's ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Government agents were seeking evidence of eagle poisoning, but  
Paul Berger was convicted only of improper use of a pesticide, a 
minor offense. CNN later aired footage of the raid. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the Bergers could  
sue the government officials involved in the raid as well as CNN. 
The Supreme Court ruled the Bergers could not sue the officials, 
but it has not yet acted on CNN's separate appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Justice John Paul Stevens voted to let both lawsuits  
proceed to trial. He said the constitutional violations were clear 
in 1992 and 1993.

<HEADLINE> Baggy-Pants Toys Spark Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Homies, tiny baggy-pants-clad plastic figures  
sold as 50-cent toys, have come under attack by authorities who say 
they glorify gang culture. 
</P>
<P>
	A million of the figures, with names like Droopy, Mr. Raza and  
Big Loco, have been sold since they went on the market four months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary that kids are playing with this,'' said Detective  
P.J. Morris, a member of the police gang detail in the San Fernando 
Valley. ``We're trying to fight and teach kids to stay away from 
gangs, and we have to contend with this as well?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris is trying to get merchants to stop offering Homies, which  
are sold as keychain figures and in gumball machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Their creator, David Gonzales, 39, says the figures are simply  
caricatures of people he knew growing up in a Mexican-American 
barrio near San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a big part of our culture: young, low rider Chicano  
kids wearing baggy clothes,'' said Gonzales. ``Most of them are 
based on people I met. A lot of them are my friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzales said he keeps the characters violence and drug free.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't push gangs,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Homies first appeared as a cartoon strip in Low Rider magazine  
when Gonzales was a 17-year-old high school student in Richmond. He 
was a low rider himself, driving a lowered 1974 Chevy Caprice. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he has drawn or designed about 40 characters,  
including a priest, a chef, a police officer, a grandmother and 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Six figures -- Droopy, Smiley, Sapo, Mr. Raza, Big Loco and Eight  
Ball -- are the first to become toys. 
</P>
<P>
	They are viewed negatively by Helen Hernandez, president and  
founder of the Imagen Foundation, which honors positive Hispanic 
images in entertainment and advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``They perpetuate stereotypes,'' said Hernandez. ``Who is he  
kidding?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Homies drew mixed reviews among San Fernando Valley children.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're cool! They're gangsters. Can I have one?'' asked Gino  
Johnson, 9. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not really a positive influence on little kids,'' said  
Eliana Cortes, 11. ``If little kids get them, they'll want to play 
with them and then they'll want to be like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Homies are made in Taiwan by A&AMP;ACompany/Parkway Machine Corp.  
</P>
<P>
	Brian Kovens, owner of the Maryland-based company, said orders  
have come from California, Texas, New Mexico, Florida and New York, 
which have large Hispanic populations, and from Utah, North 
Carolina, Georgia and Iowa.

<HEADLINE> Panthers Sign No. 1 Pick Terry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The Carolina Panthers signed top draft  
choice Chris Terry on Monday, marking the earliest in the team's 
five-year history that it has landed its No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The team would not disclose financial terms of the four-year  
deal, but sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the 
package is worth nearly $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina, which did not have a first-round pick in last month's  
draft, used its second-round selection, No. 34 overall, on the 
6-foot-5, 295-pound Terry. He went to Georgia as a defensive tackle 
but was switched to offense, a move that led to him being named a 
second-team All-America and a first-team All-Southeastern 
Conference selection last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers have had trouble in recent years signing their top  
draft choices. In two of the last three seasons, their first picks 
never even made it to training camp. Running back Tshimanga 
Biakabutuka never made it to camp in 1996, and defensive end Jason 
Peter missed all of camp last year. 
</P>
<P>
	First-year coach George Seifert, who has said Terry will be  
given a chance to be a starter as a rookie, called Monday's signing 
a step in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you are venturing into a new endeavor, it is an  
advantage to be working at it from the beginning,'' Seifert said. 
``If you are a rookie player, it is in everyone's best interest to 
be at camp, and this helps Chris start on a positive note. I also 
think it says that he wants to get off to a good start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers also announced Monday the re-signing of free agents  
Fred Lane, a reserve running back, and Ken Walter, their starting 
punter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane, who led the Panthers in rushing last year with 717 yards  
before losing his starting job to Biakabutuka, signed a two-year 
contract. Walter, who was second in the NFC with a 38.1 yard net 
punting average last season, signed a one-year deal. He will be 
challenged in camp this year by Klaus Wilmsmeyer, an unrestricted 
free agent who joined the Panthers from Miami in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panther begin two weeks of summer coaching sessions next  
week, their final activities before reporting to training camp in 
late July in Spartanburg, S.C.

<HEADLINE> Kmart Could Get Stuck With Leases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Kmart Corp. unloaded its Builders Square home  
improvement stores two years ago, but could be burdened with $761 
million in store leases if the new owners fail to keep up with its 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Hechinger Co. is struggling with widening losses and a cutback  
in credit from some of its vendors. In addition, the Largo, 
Md.-based company recently missed a large payment on its debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Such problems may cause Hechinger to miss its lease payments.  
That would leave Troy, Mich.-based Kmart with the brunt of the 
financial obligation. 
</P>
<P>
	Builders Square was one of four subsidiaries that Kmart sold or  
spun off in recent years as it moved to focus on its discount 
stores. Under the deals, Kmart guaranteed leases now worth $1.2 
billion, of which $761 million is for Builders Square, according to 
a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither company returned calls for comment placed Monday by The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	After closely held Hechinger bought Builders Square in 1997, it  
merged its stores with two other chains to create the third-largest 
home-improvement retailer behind Home Depot and Lowe's. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Home Depot and Lowe's have added stores and boosted  
profits, while Hechinger has struggled. The company has been 
remodeling stores and shedding others, ending April with 206 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
	In filings with the SEC earlier this month, Hechinger said it  
lost $208 million before one-time expenses on $509 million in 
revenue in the three months ending in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's outlook worsened Friday, when Standard &AMP; Poor's  
downgraded much of Hechinger's debt after it put off a $4.7 million 
interest payment. Standard &AMP; Poor's said in a news release that it 
thought Hechinger would miss other debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart, in an April SEC filing, said it had helped finance a new  
$50 million credit line for Hechinger. The company, however, said 
it had not set aside any money for lease guarantees, but would do 
so ``at the time the obligation was determined to be probable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the problem has the potential to hurt Kmart's bottom line,  
analysts said it was not an immediate threat to the company. If 
Kmart did have to cover the lease payments, it could threaten the 
retailer's recent turnaround, with its profits and sales steadily 
rising over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors need to be aware there would be a chain of events or  
several circumstances before there would be an ultimate liability 
at Kmart,'' said Roney &AMP; Co. analyst Scott Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said if Hechinger failed, Kmart could take several  
steps to cover its costs, such as subleasing. Meanwhile, he said, 
the outlook for Hechinger was dim. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look to Home Depot and Lowe's. They're thought to be the  
two consolidators going forward,'' Campbell said. ``They're just 
dominating the segment.''

<HEADLINE> Campaign Targets Unbuckled Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 5,700 law enforcement agencies  
nationwide are cooperating in a renewed campaign to ensure that 
children are properly up buckled up when riding in automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	From today through the Memorial Day weekend, officers will make  
a special effort to ticket motorists if children are not restrained 
in safety seats or seat belts, said the Air Bag and Seat Belt 
Safety Campaign, sponsor of the semiannual crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the possibility of being in a crash does not motivate  
people to buckle up their children, the probability of receiving a 
ticket has proven to be a powerful motivator,'' Govs. John Engler 
of Michigan and Howard Dean of Vermont said in a recent letter 
asking colleagues for their support. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of 10 children killed in crashes were riding unrestrained,  
according to federal figures. About half of those children would be 
alive if they were restrained properly, the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Car crashes are the leading cause of death for children under  
15. In 1997, more than 2,000 children were killed and 320,000 
injured in traffic crashes, according to federal statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	All states have laws requiring that children younger than 4 be  
restrained while riding in a car, and many states also require that 
children younger than 16 wear seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	But 27 states with seat belt laws for those older children do  
not cover all youngsters under 16 when they ride in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
	All states allow police to stop and ticket motorists solely  
because the youngest children are not wearing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 15 states and the District of Columbia have primary seat  
belt laws for adults and older children. Other states have 
secondary seat belt laws that require police to first pull 
motorists over for some other traffic offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety campaign also seeks to persuade adults to buckle up  
because research has shown a belted driver is three times more 
likely to restrain a child. Between 60 percent and 70 percent of 
Americans wear seat belts, according to federal and state 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators credited the campaign with helping to buckle  
up 19 million more Americans last year, the largest single-year 
increase in seat belt use in years.

	An attempt by hundreds of physicians to form the nation's first

seeking to represent the doctors, was considering an appeal of the 
decision. The union also said it may try to pass federal 
legislation that would give physicians the right to organize. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that our efforts along with the other unions have  
brought this to a head,'' said Anthony Cinaglia, president of the 
Pennsauken, N.J.-based union. ``We believe there's been a moral 
victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While physician unions do exist, they involve doctors employed  
directly by hospitals or clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the New Jersey doctors are eventually successful,  
unionization may not be an answer to their problems, said Uwe 
Reinhardt, a Princeton University health economist. 
</P>
<P>
	``They think they can as a union sit there and shove a unionized  
fee scale down the throat of the insurer,'' said Reinhardt. He 
added that it would never be effective because insurance carriers 
in turn would band together to negotiate with the doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just simply can't create a physician monopoly,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Moore-Duncan had also ruled against the union last year but  
was ordered to hold a hearing after the doctors appealed. She heard 
14 days of testimony, the first hearings ever before the NLRB on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we're disappointed. We feel it should have gone the  
other way,'' Cinaglia said. ``We understand that they're 
interpreting the law very narrowly. Perhaps we need to change the 
law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The union filed a petition in 1997 seeking to have family  
doctors and specialists in Atlantic and Cape May counties declared 
employees of the HMO. Initially, only AmeriHealth was targeted, but 
the union had planned to target other HMOs if the strategy proved 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
	AmeriHealth insisted the doctors are independent medical  
practitioners because most of their income comes from other sources 
and the doctors provide their own facilities, equipment and support 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are, of course, pleased with the decision,'' AmeriHealth  
chairman and chief executive G. Fred DiBona, Jr., said in a 
statement. ``This has been a costly and time-consuming effort for 
everyone, but clarifies a question of considerable importance to 
consumers, providers and insurers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AmeriHealth, a subsidiary of Independence Blue Cross of  
Philadelphia, covers 270,000 New Jersey residents. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs have controlled skyrocketing health costs by preventing  
unneeded treatments and watching fees charged by doctors and 
hospitals. The doctors say forming a union would return their 
control over medical decisions and improve quality of care. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has never been a question of quality care,'' DiBona said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Frederick Nahas, of Somers Point, a vascular surgeon who  
helped organize colleagues to join the union, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, patients are still going to be denied care in  
lieu of profiteering that's going on by the HMOs,'' he said. 
``That's really the bottom line: HMOs are trading patient lives and 
limbs for profits,'' said Nahas. 
</P>
<P>
	In her ruling, Moore-Duncan said the doctors still exert  
substantial control how they provide services to the HMO, have 
their own practices independent of the health maintenance 
organization, and have proprietary interests in their practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has until June 7 to request a review from the  
five-member NLRB in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. antitrust law prohibits independent contractors from  
banding together to set prices and terms for their work, but the 
NLRB has allowed unions for some whose work primarily is dictated 
by others, including entertainers, athletes, cab drivers and, most 
recently, couriers. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 38,000 to 45,000 doctors -- about 6 percent of the  
nation's doctors -- belong to unions, up from about 25,000 two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Medical Association, a trade group that represents  
about half of the nation's doctors, shares the doctors' complaints 
about HMOs but has long rejected traditional labor unions. AMA 
officials declined to comment on the ruling.
