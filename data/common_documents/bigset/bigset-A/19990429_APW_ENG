<HEADLINE> Caterpillar, Workers Reach Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOLIET, Ill. (AP) -- Caterpillar Inc. and the Machinists union  
reached a tentative agreement Thursday, averting a potential strike 
at the company's Joliet, Ill., factory. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement covers more than 1,400 workers at the Joliet  
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators for Caterpillar and representatives of the  
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers met 
with a federal mediator for more than 24 hours before reaching the 
agreement. Union members will be asked to vote on the deal Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement includes a six-year contract with three lump-sum  
payments for all active workers and a cost of living adjustment. 
Some workers will get a 3 percent pay increase each year until they 
reach the maximum allowed for their pay scale, the union said. 
</P>
<P>
	Machinists make an hourly wage that ranges between $8 and more  
than $20. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,465 Machinists work at the Joliet plant. The last  
Caterpillar strike there was in 1986.

<HEADLINE> Raytheon Fixing Missile Defect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- More than 5,000 Maverick missiles have been  
removed from service by the United States military as Raytheon Co. 
works to correct defects that have caused the projectiles to miss 
their targets at unacceptable rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The malfunctioning missiles have also sparked a lawsuit against  
the company that Raytheon claims sold it faulty parts. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the Maverick missiles that are the subject of the  
lawsuit have been identified, and they are in the process of being 
repaired, or are being stored by the government awaiting repair,'' 
Raytheon spokesman David Polk said Thursday. ``None are being 
deployed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon has filed a lawsuit accusing Helix Technology Corp. of  
Mansfield, Mass., of supplying defective cryoengines, a $2,100 part 
that helps regulate the missile's temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	Helix denies manufacturing faulty parts.  
</P>
<P>
	``They were not defective. The cryoengines went through a series  
of inspections by Helix personnel prior to release,'' said the 
company's lawyer, Craig Stewart. ``When the last of these 
cryoengines left our facility in March of 1994, they were in 
perfect condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said that before the parts left Helix's factory, they  
were inspected by representatives of Raytheon and the Department of 
Defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have control after that point,'' Stewart said,  
adding that Helix no longer supplies parts to the Maverick program. 
</P>
<P>
	Various generations of the Maverick missile have been in service  
since 1972, but the defect has been found only on missiles from one 
production lot. The Maverick is carried under the wings of F-15E, 
F-16 and A-10 jets and is used to destroy surface targets like 
tanks and armor, air defenses, ships, transportation equipment and 
fuel storage facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Mavericks can be launched from high altitudes to tree-top level  
and can hit targets ranging from a distance of a few thousand feet 
to about 15 miles. The missile has ``launch-and-leave'' capability 
that enables a pilot to fire it and immediately take evasive action 
or attack another target as the missile guides itself to the 
target. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force discovered the problem during routine testing in  
1994, said Col. Bob George, head of the armament division and 
program manager for surface to air munitions at Hill Air Force Base 
in Utah. He said 44 percent of the missiles in a batch produced 
under a 1991 defense contract were found to have the defect. 
</P>
<P>
	The missiles were manufactured at a former Raytheon facility in  
Bristol, Tenn., but they are being repaired in Tucson, Ariz., said 
Polk. 
</P>
<P>
	He said American forces fighting in the Balkans still have  
access to properly functioning Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
	The missile is used primarily by the Air Force, although the  
Navy has a supply as well. Mavericks have been sold to American 
allies, but Polk said all the defective missiles are under American 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about a very small percentage of the total  
number of Mavericks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Polk would not say what damages Raytheon was seeking from Helix.

<HEADLINE> Blenheim Plans Spicy Ginger Ale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMER, S.C. (AP) -- The small black-and-white ad in the back of  
the New Yorker magazine shows the Blenheim Ginger Ale plant as it 
looked nearly 100 years ago -- a small bottling facility nestled in 
the South Carolina piney woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind that today a line of clinking bottles straight out of  
Laverne and Shirley speeds by hunched-over workers in this modern 
factory that churns out 100,000 cases of potent, turn-your-lips-red 
ginger ale each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Or that owner Alan Schafer probably is better known to New  
Yorkers zipping to Florida along Interstate 95 by his alter ego -- 
Pedro, the mascot of the tourist trap South of the Border with its 
video poker parlors, gift shops, restaurants and love bungalows. 
</P>
<P>
	Schafer, Blenheim president Mackey Hayes and plant manager  
Charles Thomas are plotting to take the spicy concoction from the 
swamps and woods of South Carolina to Manhattan's penthouses as 
they attempt to expand its reach. 
</P>
<P>
	It was around the last turn of the century when Dr. C.R. Mays  
prescribed the iron- and sulfur-laced spring water from the town of 
Blenheim -- Schafer says ``Blenum,'' as it's known across the 
Carolinas -- for stomach problems. Mays threw in ginger after 
patients complained of the taste, and Blenheim Ginger Ale was born. 
</P>
<P>
	The company went through various owners before Schafer bought it  
in 1993. ``I was drinking Blenheim when I was a kid, about 75 years 
ago,'' he said. ``And I didn't want to see it go down the drain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1980s, Blenheim gained some national attention, appearing  
in Charles Kuralt's ``On the Road'' television series and in 
Playboy magazine. But then irregular production and inconsistent 
taste made many customers wonder if the spring had run dry. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, filters take out the iron and sulfur, but Indian and  
Jamaican ginger give the beverage its spicy kick. Blenheim, which 
costs about $16 for a 24-bottle case, sells about $1 million a year 
of three varieties of ginger ale -- hot, not as hot and diet. 
</P>
<P>
	With its signature black-and-yellow sandwich board signs,  
Blenheim has built a loyal following in small grocery stores like 
the Mauldin Open-Air Market in Greenville County. There, Nancy 
Lockhart says sales fluctuate from 25 to 40 cases a month, 
depending on the weather. The potent ginger clears up sinuses in a 
flash, making it a popular drink during cold season, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schafer, Hayes and Thomas, however, want to target new upscale  
customers, and Hayes hopes to increase mail-order sales and cut 
down on the company's shipping costs to retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes and Schafer think young executives in California and New  
York will buy Blenheim as a new specialty drink, just like they did 
with micro-brewed beer a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes wants to position Blenheim along with other luxuries. ``If  
you're going to sell Mercedes, you're going to look at the 
demographics and determine your market segment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But to do that, Blenheim must capitalize on its down-home roots  
and authenticity, said Tom Agan of Kurt Salmon Associates, an 
Atlanta-based retail consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Daniels, for instance, used the image of its hometown of  
Lynchburg, Tenn., to build a national customer base. Typically, 
though, niche brands only flourish nationally for a short time 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just a plateau they reach and they aren't able to get  
past that,'' Agan said. 
</P>
<P>
	And there is the danger that if they become too successful  
nationally, they will attract the attention of a Coke, Pepsi or 
Cadbury Schweppes, which makes the more sweet ginger ale, he said. 
Those companies can throw their marketing muscle into niche markets 
and swallow up smaller competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, said many  
small brands have trouble expanding beyond their region because 
they struggle with relatively scant marketing budgets to gain name 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	Blenheim should market itself as a unique brand, like Snapple  
did in health stores, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Mauldin Open-Air Market, Lockhart laughs at the thought  
of yuppies buying Blenheim ginger ale. Most of her customers, like 
the one who buys it to keep from drinking alcohol, don't fall into 
the high-end category Schafer and Hayes want to target. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I don't believe the New Yorker part is coming into play  
here,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Starr Dealt Another Court Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Independent counsel Kenneth Starr is  
rethinking whether to try Susan McDougal a second time on criminal 
contempt charges after a judge said prosecutors can't talk to 
jurors from her recent trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are evaluating our next step,'' Starr spokeswoman Elizabeth  
Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they wanted to talk to jurors because it would  
help them make a decision about whether to seek a retrial of Mrs. 
McDougal on the two contempt counts that jurors deadlocked on. The 
jury acquitted her of an obstruction of justice charge. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. concluded Starr's  
office had not shown ``good cause'' for the court to make an 
exception to a policy of ``not invading the province of the jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard wrote that ``permitting the unbridled interviewing of  
jurors could easily lead to their harassment, to the exploitation 
of their thought processes ... and to diminished confidence in jury 
verdicts as well as unbalanced trial results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos of Los Angeles, at first  
said he would welcome such interviews by the prosecution team, but 
he later changed his mind and objected to the request. Geragos said 
Arkansans had been bothered enough by Starr's investigation. Also, 
he said, federal rules do not allow an inquiry into the ``mental 
processes'' of jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	After the judge's decision Wednesday, Geragos said, ``They are  
never going to retry this case. It's just more nonsense and a way 
for them to spend more tax dollars. It's time they came to their 
senses, packed up and moved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Various members of the jury have talked to the news media since  
the verdict this month. In interviews with The Associated Press, 
Donald Thomas, the jury foreman, said he was put off by the 
``arrogance'' of Starr's prosecutors and felt the testimony of 
Starr's deputy, Hickman Ewing, was evasive. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said that testimony from other witnesses -- especially  
Julie Hiatt Steele, who like Mrs. McDougal was charged with 
obstructing Starr's probe -- convinced some jurors that Mrs. 
McDougal's fears about testifying to a grand jury were justified. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal was indicted after she refused twice to talk to a  
grand jury about President Clinton and the first lady. She said she 
thought she'd be charged with perjury unless she falsely implicated 
the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Juror Angela Smith, one of five jurors who wanted to convict  
Mrs. McDougal of criminal contempt, has said she saw no evidence 
Starr's team acted improperly. 
</P>
<P>
	But another juror, Becky Boeckmann, said she wanted to acquit  
Mrs. McDougal on all counts and doubted she knows anything of value 
to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the jurors who wanted to acquit Mrs. McDougal on all  
three counts, Michael Nance, insisted Starr's office ``was not on 
trial here, only Mrs. McDougal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She honestly believed that she could be held for a false  
statement'' and that explained why she didn't talk, said Nance.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules on Child-Death Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- A judge ruled today that four children  
cannot stay in their old home where four other youngsters were 
believed to have been slain. 
</P>
<P>
	Juvenile Judge Michael Murphy placed the children -- a  
12-year-old boy and three girls, ages 11 to 8, who have been in 
separate foster homes -- in the custody of a grandmother, Cecile 
Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
	The coroner ruled the four deaths were homicides by  
asphyxiation, but no charges have been filed. Police suspect one of 
the girls might have suffocated the victims, ages 1 to 3, but they 
have no proof. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue before the judge was whether the girl and the three  
other children would be allowed to live together again at the home 
of Regina Moreland. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said there was no evidence that the children were at  
risk from Ms. Moreland, so it was not immediately clear why the 
judge did not allow the children to return home. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Moreland, who was the grandmother of three of the children  
who died and a great-aunt of the other, maintains that the deaths 
stemmed from natural causes and that her home is safe. She fought 
for the return of her three children and a grandchild. Ms. Marshall 
is her mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are ``extremely disappointed'' with the judge's  
decision, added Jim Knight, spokesman for the prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	During a custody hearing in March, a mental health worker said  
the girl police suspect in the deaths told her she sometimes held 
her hand over the mouths of the children to get them to stop 
crying, something her siblings also did. 
</P>
<P>
	But the girl denied causing their deaths, saying she believed  
other family members were responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl's therapist said he believes she is innocent.

<HEADLINE> Barksdale Invests $5M in Web Grocer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLEVUE, Wash. (AP) -- HomeGrocer.com, an Internet grocery  
shopping and home delivery business, has landed the first 
investment by a group headed by former Netscape Communications 
Corp. president James Barksdale. 
</P>
<P>
	The Barksdale Group, formed specifically to aid newly founded  
Internet businesses with high growth potential, is putting $5 
million into the year-old company, HomeGrocer spokesman Michael 
Kormanik said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barksdale, 56, formerly chief executive of AT&AMP;T Wireless  
Services and former executive vice president of Federal Express, 
took an undisclosed ownership share and will join the board of 
directors, Kormanik said. 
</P>
<P>
	``His experience with distribution, national rollout and the  
Internet are unparalleled,'' HomeGrocer cofounder and chief 
executive Terry Drayton said. ``I personally look forward to 
working with a person I consider a wonderful mentor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barksdale formed his venture capital firm after receiving $700  
million last month when Netscape was purchased by America Online 
for $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating from a 75,000-square-foot warehouse in this Seattle  
suburb, HomeGrocer has about 200 employees.

<HEADLINE> Bush Headlines $14M GOP Fund-Raiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With an assist from former President Bush, the  
Republican National Committee's annual black-tie gala brought in a 
record $14 million -- money that may be used to try to elect another 
Bush to the presidency next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and his wife, Barbara, were the guests of honor at  
Wednesday night's affair, dining on herb-crusted tenderloin and 
chocolate emblazoned with the presidential seal and exhorting the 
party faithful to elect a Republican president in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it is essential that we put a Republican in the  
White House,'' Bush said, flanked by a display of official seals 
that illustrated his career in public service: U.N. ambassador, 
House member, CIA director, Republican Party chairman and 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Other speakers, including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of  
Mississippi and House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois echoed the 
same sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	But only Bush among the speakers has a son who is raising money  
to seek the presidential nomination. Texas Gov. George W. Bush was 
back in Austin, where the state legislature was meeting, though 
four other presidential hopefuls -- former Tennessee Gov. Lamar 
Alexander, former American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole, and 
Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Bob Smith of New Hampshire -- did 
attend the gala, shaking hands and mingling with some of the 1,200 
attendees. 
</P>
<P>
	``An energized party is going to help Republicans all across the  
country,'' said the younger Bush's campaign spokeswoman, Mindy 
Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson said some of the money the party is  
raising now may be used during the presidential campaign next year 
to air issue advertisements touting the Republican message. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the nominee becomes apparent, which will be in  
mid-March, we can assist our nominee in getting the message out to 
the American people,'' Nicholson said in an interview. ``Whoever is 
the nominee will be broke. I don't want our party broke. We can 
then start advertising the Republican message to the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Republicans and Democrats aired millions of dollars in  
issue ads during the 1996 campaign on behalf of their presidential 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Election Commission auditors recommended last December  
that President Clinton repay $7 million and Republican nominee Bob 
Dole pay back $17.7 million in federal funds that went to their 
1996 presidential bids, saying both illegally benefited from the 
ads. But the commission threw out the recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If 1996 is any guide, then both parties are going to use soft  
money to once again help their presidential nominees in a way that 
we believe is contrary to law,'' said Donald Simon of Common Cause, 
a group that favors changing the campaign finance laws. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Wages, Benefits Rise Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wages and benefits for American workers rose a  
slight 0.4 percent in the first three months of the year, the 
smallest amount on record, indicating the lowest unemployment in 
three decades is still not generating wage pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The 0.4 percent increase reported today in the Labor  
Department's Employment Cost Benefit was just half the 0.8 percent 
advance that private economists had been expecting. The 
first-quarter gain followed a much larger, 0.7 percent advance from 
October through December of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	While small wage and benefit gains are generally not good news  
for workers, the moderation in wage pressures is occurring at a 
time of low inflation as well, meaning that workers' take-home-pay 
is not being eroded by higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The slack wage pressures are occurring even though the overall  
unemployment rate dipped to a 29-year-low of 4.2 percent in March. 
For all of last year, unemployment averaged its lowest level in 
three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of slight wage pressure and low unemployment has  
given the Federal Reserve the leeway to allow the economy to 
continue growing at a rapid clip without feeling the need to start 
raising interest rates to prevent inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	A second report today showed further good news for American  
workers. The Labor Department said new claims for unemployment 
benefits declined by a larger-than-expected amount last week, 
falling to 294,000 new claims, down 20,000 people from the week 
before. It was the biggest one-week decline in three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer new claims for unemployment benefits mean job layoffs are  
declining. The big drop in claims was a surprise to analysts, who 
had expected little change following a decline of 5,000 the 
previous week after two weeks of increases in applications. 
</P>
<P>
	The 0.4 percent rise in wages and benefits was the smallest  
quarterly advance since the Labor Department began tracking these 
figures in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall gain reflected a 0.5 percent advance in wages and  
salaries and a 0.3 percent rise in benefit costs, which include 
health insurance and pension contributions. The wages and salaries 
increase was the smallest since September 1992 and the benefit 
advance was the lowest since March 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 12 months ending in March, overall employment costs were  
up 3 percent, an even better showing than a 3 percent rise for the 
12 months ending in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The current economic expansion is already the longest in  
peacetime history with uninterrupted growth for more than eight 
years. Well before this point in most previous expansions, tight 
labor markets have triggered rising wage demands and forced the 
Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates to slow the 
economy, a process that often leads to a new recession. 
</P>
<P>
	By industry, the biggest rise in wages and benefits was enjoyed  
by service workers, a rise of 1.1 percent. Manufacturing workers 
saw wages and benefits increase by just 0.6 percent. This sector 
has been the hardest hit by the Asian currency crisis, suffering a 
loss of more than 300,000 jobs in the past year.

                           *Rory Calhoun    	
</P>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Rory Calhoun, the stalwart hero of  
Western movies and the TV series ``The Texan,'' died Wednesday at 
the age of 76. He had been hospitalized with advanced emphysema and 
diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	His face and sturdy physique won him lesser roles in ``Something  
for the Boys,'' ``Sunday Dinner for a Soldier,'' ``The 
Bullfighters'' and other wartime films. His most important early 
role came as boxer James Corbett in ``The Great John L.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, whose real name was Francis Timothy Durgin, saw his  
career accelerate after meeting agent Henry Willson, who discovered 
and invented names for Rock Hudson, Tab Hunter and Troy Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun was considered ideal for such Westerns as ``Massacre  
River,'' ``Rogue River,'' ``Yellow Tomahawk'' and ``Four Guns to 
the Border.'' In the late '40s and early '50s, he also appeared in 
``The Red House,'' ``Ticket to Tomahawk,'' ``How to Marry a 
Millionaire,'' ``Meet Me After the Show'' and ``With a Song in My 
Heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From 1958 to 1960, Calhoun starred in a CBS television Western,  
``The Texan.'' He played Big Bill Longley, a fast gun who traveled 
from town to town helping those who were victimized by bad men. 
</P>
<P>
	In his later career, Calhoun appeared in lower budget films,  
many of them made abroad. From 1982 to 1987, he appeared on the CBS 
soap opera ``Capitol.'' He also was host of reruns of ``Death 
Valley Days'' in the syndicated ``Western Star Theater.''

                             *John Colt    	
</P>
<P>
	AMHERST, Mass. (AP) -- John Colt, an artist who focused on nature  
in all its abstractions, died Tuesday at the age of 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Colt was on the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee art faculty  
for 33 years until his retirement in 1990, and was a visiting 
professor at Northern Michigan University, Ball State University in 
Indiana, American University in Beirut, the University of 
Saskatchewan and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Colt painted insects, worms and rotting fruit in a way to make  
them look both real and abstract. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, as Bruce Pepich, director of the Wustum Museum of Art in  
Racine, put it, Colt discovered ``a macro universe in a micro 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His paintings, drawings and prints have been exhibited in more  
than 100 shows in the state and around the nation, including the 
Art Institute of Chicago, Library of Congress in Washington and the 
Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. His work is in the permanent 
collection of the Whitney Museum in New York City.

<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- John DeCleux, a popular Ozarks radio  
show host, died Tuesday at age 58. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not available.  
</P>
<P>
	For the past four years, DeCleux had worked with Bonnie Bell as  
co-host of KWTO-AM's ``Open Line'' on weekday mornings. 
</P>
<P>
	His broadcast career spanned more than 20 years and included  
time at radio stations in Flat River and West Plains, Mo.; 
Collierville and Memphis, Tenn.; and Jackson, Miss. He once had the 
top-rated radio show in Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Deborah.  

</P>
<P>
                          *Max Hutchinson    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Max Hutchinson, an art dealer who played a key  
role in the sale of Jackson Pollock's painting ``Blue Poles'' to 
the National Gallery of Australia, died Friday. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	At the height of his career in the 1970s, Hutchinson owned  
galleries in New York, Houston and Melbourne, and often acted as an 
agent for his native Australia's National Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	In that capacity he repeatedly approached collector Ben Heller,  
who had owned ``Blue Poles,'' a large, late drip painting, since 
the mid-1950s. In 1974 Heller agreed to sell the work for $2 
million, at the time a price commanded only by Old Master 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian Parliament approved the purchase, sparking a  
storm of protest that brought down the government of Prime Minister 
Gough Whitlam.

</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Melba Liston, a jazz trombonist, composer and  
arranger who worked with bands led by Dizzy Gillespie and Quincy 
Jones, died Friday after suffering a series of strokes. She was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz called Ms. Liston ``one of the  
most accomplished trombonists of her generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Liston was forced to stop trombone playing in 1985 after a  
stroke left her partially paralyzed, but she continued to arrange 
music with her longtime friend, pianist Randy Weston. The two 
shared billing in 1993 on their critically acclaimed album 
``Volcano Blues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While in her teens, Ms. Liston played in youth bands and joined  
Gerald Wilson's band as a trombonist and arranger. When the group 
disbanded in 1948, she joined Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
	She briefly left jazz for a job at the Los Angeles Board of  
Education, but joined Gillespie again in 1955 for a State 
Department tour of the Middle East and Asia. She also worked with 
one of Gillespie's trumpeters, Quincy Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s, she taught in Jamaica at the University of the  
West Indies and the Jamaica Institute of Music. She returned to the 
United States in the early 1980s.

</P>
<P>
	A native of Vienna, Austria, Shuman's first job was as a copy

                       *Michi Nishiura Weglyn    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michi Nishiura Weglyn, who wrote a widely  
acclaimed book on the internment of Japanese-Americans during World 
War II, died of cancer Sunday. She was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 1976 book, ``Years of Infamy, The Untold Story of America's  
Concentration Camps,'' described the experiences of 120,000 
Japanese-Americans who were rounded up by the U.S. government in 
the early days of World War II and interned as security risks. 
</P>
<P>
	While the book was coolly received at first, its powerful prose  
and solid documentation eventually helped spur demands for redress 
and a national apology by President Gerald Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Weglyn's family had been one of the thousands of others  
interned to a desert camp in Gila River, Ariz., during the war 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	She later became a New York costume designer and was drawn to  
social causes in the 1970s. She then became a familiar figure at 
the National Archives in Washington, D.C., poring over dusty 
documents from opening to closing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Her research discredited President Roosevelt's 1942 claim that  
``military necessity'' justified the internments, and revealed 
thousands of Japanese from Latin American countries were also held 
in the U.S. camps.

<HEADLINE> Jones' Lawyers Defend Talk Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A gay guest on ``The Jenny Jones Show''  
who was killed three days after revealing a crush on another man 
told his mother the two had sex after taping the show, a jury was 
told. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Amedure's mother didn't necessarily believe him, but she  
repeated the claim to a television reporter after Amedure was shot 
and killed by Jonathan Schmitz, according to testimony on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure's family is suing the show and its distributor, Warner  
Bros., for $50 million, contending a mentally ill Schmitz was lured 
onto the show believing he would meet a woman, and was humiliated 
to the point of murder when his ``secret admirer'' turned out to be 
Amedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days after the taping, Schmitz -- who has said he is  
heterosexual -- killed Amedure with a shotgun. Schmitz was found 
guilty of murder in 1996, but his conviction was thrown out on 
appeal. His retrial is set for Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the show argue Schmitz was told his secret admirer  
could be a man or woman, and that the show played no role in 
Amedure's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney James Feeney showed jurors part of a videotaped  
deposition of Patricia Graves, Amedure's mother. Shortly after the 
shooting, Ms. Graves told a reporter that Amedure had said he and 
Schmitz had ``an affair'' after the show. 
</P>
<P>
	But in her deposition, Ms. Graves said she had not taken  
Amedure's statement seriously, and did not question him about it: 
``You had to know Scott to know when he was being up front with you 
or kidding around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense also played the deposition of Ronnie Perez, another  
guest on the same episode. Perez said he and Amedure spoke by phone 
after the taping. 
</P>
<P>
	``All he said was `I'll tell you something. Can you keep a  
secret?''' Perez said. ``I said yeah. He said `I slept with Jon.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Feeney said the evidence was important because it showed there  
could be other reasons Schmitz shot Amedure besides their 
appearance on the program.

<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Mormon church President Gordon B. Hinckley  
remembers his father's attempt 60 years ago to persuade church 
leaders to rebuild the Nauvoo Temple overlooking the Mississippi 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	``The church didn't have a lot of money in those days. That was  
just coming out of the Depression. ... They declined it,'' said 
Hinckley, overseer of a temple-building program unprecedented in 
the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	He never forgot his father's desire as a Chicago mission  
president to rebuild the temple amid the Illinois farmlands about 
150 miles upriver from St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The gleaming edifice was nearing completion in 1846, when  
Brigham Young led the Mormons on their exodus to the West. Their 
welcome in Illinois had worn out amid complaints about Mormons' 
theocratic views and about polygamy then practiced by some members. 
The temple was set afire after they left. 
</P>
<P>
	In his surprise announcement on Easter Sunday that Nauvoo would  
regain its temple, Hinckley was fulfilling his late father's wish. 
He also was striking a chord of longing within the Utah-based 
church to right a historical wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rebuilding of the Nauvoo Temple will bring back a clear  
and vivid reminder of what Nauvoo was. Nauvoo was a prosperous and 
great city,'' Hinckley said in a recent interview, noting that the 
new temple will closely resemble the grand original. 
</P>
<P>
	As president of the 10.4 million-member church since 1995,  
Hinckley has worked to double the number of temples where Mormons 
in good standing perform sacred ordinances considered essential to 
the faith's concept of eternal progression. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Hinckley's innovation to build smaller-scale temples in  
more places means most Mormons won't have to travel daunting 
distances to a temple. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the church has 57 operating temples and 55 in some stage  
of planning or construction. Forty-seven are of the smaller type. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every temple that this church has built has, in effect, stood  
as a monument to our belief in the immortality of the human soul, 
that this phase of mortal life through which we pass is but one ... 
part of a continuous upward climb, so to speak. And that as certain 
as there's life here, there will be life there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The temple, Hinckley said, serves as a bridge between mortality  
and immortality. As envisioned by church founder Joseph Smith in 
Nauvoo, temple rituals would embrace ``the ancient order of things 
for the first time in these last days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springing nimbly from his chair, Hinckley, who will turn 89 in  
June, retrieved a small model of the Nauvoo Temple from atop a 
cabinet in his office and placed it before a visitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This building was the finest in Illinois. It was the crowning  
phase of their belief, the crowning objective of their worship and 
there were many people who worked on it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Mormons were driven from Nauvoo, their temple was soon  
vandalized and gutted by arson, its walls later buckled by tornado. 
Reduced to its foundation, it came to symbolize for Mormons what 
was best and most bitter about their sojourn in western Illinois 
from 1839 to 1846. 
</P>
<P>
	The faith's young founder and prophet was murdered by a mob in  
nearby Carthage less than four years after selecting the site of 
the Nauvoo Temple, the spiritual center of the bustling city of 
12,000 that almost rivaled Chicago in population. 
</P>
<P>
	Nauvoo was where Smith's vision of a vibrant theocracy achieved  
its fullest flowering. But just as before in Missouri, political, 
economic and religious differences with non-Mormons -- and with 
apostates unhappy with the then-secret practice of polygamy -- 
degenerated into armed conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than two years after Smith was slain in 1844, the ``City of  
Joseph'' stood a virtual shell. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, down a verdant, sloping hill from the modern town of  
1,227 lies the Nauvoo Historic District, a National Historic 
Landmark containing more than two dozen restored houses and shops, 
visitor centers and a 700-acre farm. The sites drew more than 
200,000 visitors last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Though only about 10 percent of Nauvoo's inhabitants now are  
Mormon, Hinckley's plan to rebuild the temple could have a profound 
effect on the farming town's pastoral serenity. That's because 
Mormon retirees tend to congregate near temples. 
</P>
<P>
	``We here at City Hall knew nothing about it,'' says Carol  
McGhghy, the city clerk. ``It's kind of a mixed emotion around 
here. Of course, if you're a member of the church you're ecstatic. 
A lot of people, though, want Nauvoo just the way it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his announcement, Hinckley said an anonymous donor had made  
the rebuilding possible. In the interview he said the donation 
wasn't the catalyst for the project but ``moved it along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley said the temple would be built on the original site and  
be as close to a replica as possible. The original temple had a 
165-foot tower and spire graced by a recumbent angel. Modern 
temples have the trumpet-blowing angel standing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what we'll do about that,'' Hinckley quipped. ``I  
don't know. We'll face that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the structure will be built of reinforced concrete block  
and will meet modern seismic standards, the exterior will be faced 
in light-gray limestone from the same quarries -- now owned by the 
church -- that yielded the original stone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a beautiful building,'' Hinckley said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft E-mail Raising Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A computer company in Utah suing Microsoft has  
unsealed e-mails to support claims suggesting the software giant 
intentionally looked for ways to make its smaller rival's product 
fail when used with early versions of Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera Inc. contends Microsoft took steps during the late 1980s  
to ensure that some of the earliest versions of Windows wouldn't 
run using Caldera's DR-DOS operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	The e-mails, along with sworn statements from Microsoft  
employees and other, were in a 188-page legal filing this week in 
federal court in Utah supporting Caldera's $1.6 billion antitrust 
suit against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft called Caldera's claims ``pulp fiction,'' and denied  
that it ever intentionally designed Windows to not operate with 
anything other than its own MS-DOS operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the previously unreleased e-mails, Microsoft Chairman  
Bill Gates asked: ``You never sent me a response on the question of 
what things an (application) would do that would make it run with 
MS-DOS and not run with DR-DOS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft acknowledges that a pre-release version of Windows 3.1  
in 1991 tested for the presence of any operating system other than 
Microsoft's and issued a ``nonfatal error'' warning. The test never 
was built into final commercial versions of Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Those earlier versions of Windows also required a DOS operating  
system, which typically was purchased separately. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Microsoft said it added the programming ``to  
determine whether the code that tested for the presence of MS-DOS 
was working properly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other e-mails indicated strong disagreement within Microsoft  
about the propriety of the programming. One employee, Rich Abel, 
wrote: ``I hate this whole thing. I think it's totally rude, 
reinforces the image that users have of us as the evil ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in his response to e-mail from Gates, another employee, Phil  
Barrett, wrote that software engineers had found three methods for 
Windows to distinguish MS-DOS from DR-DOS -- but added: ``most 
(applications) have no business making the calls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A trial on Caldera's private antitrust suit against Microsoft is  
expected to begin in January. Caldera bought the rights to DR-DOS 
in July 1996 from Novell Inc. and immediately sued Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera hasn't said what damages it seeks, but Microsoft's own  
lawyers previously mentioned the $1.6 billion figure during a court 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera alleges that Microsoft intentionally misled customers to  
believe that using Windows 95 replaced the need for computer users 
to also buy DR-DOS or MS-DOS. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera also said Microsoft refused to share pre-release copies  
of its upcoming products for testing purposes. It cited e-mail 
exchanged after Utah-based Novell -- which had owned DR-DOS before 
it sold the rights to Caldera -- suggested that Microsoft agree to 
help Novell ensure that Windows would run fine with DR-DOS. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm rolling on the ground laughing,'' Microsoft's David Cole  
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett replied, ``And I thought them Utah folks were drug  
free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's Jim Allchin added simply: ``I hate them.''

<HEADLINE> Fans Grab Tickets for O's-Cuba Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- When he was given the chance to buy tickets for  
the Baltimore Orioles' exhibition game against the Cuban national 
team Monday, Bill Meyer wasted little time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's once in a lifetime,'' said Meyer, who operates USA Stats,  
a Towson-based rotisserie baseball statistical service. ``It's an 
event, a celebration. I wouldn't miss it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles are expecting a sellout crowd at the 48,876-seat  
stadium -- and it will be a very different crowd from the one that 
watched the team play in Cuba on March 28. 
</P>
<P>
	The team put 4,000 seats on sale Saturday and 400 remained late  
Thursday. Sales were limited to two per purchase and mostly 
scattered single tickets remained. 
</P>
<P>
	A hand-picked crowd of 50,000 invited guests and supporters of  
Cuban President Fidel Castro watched the Orioles beat a Cuban 
all-star team 3-2 in 11 innings in Havana last month. 
</P>
<P>
	In Baltimore, two-thirds of the tickets for the game went to the  
fans who have full-season and mini-plans. Team owner Peter Angelos 
donated 8,000 tickets to local community and civic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the 29 remaining major league clubs was given an  
allotment. Also in the stands will be about 300 specially chosen 
Cubans, including retired players and journalists and school 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, tickets don't appear to have reached scalpers who  
advertise in local newspapers. Only a few of the established 
brokers are mentioning the Orioles-Cuba rematch in their ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's because those who were lucky enough to get tickets  
plan on using them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to be there!'' said Christy Pleasants, a college  
student from Stafford, Va., who attends spring training and about 
40 games a year. ``This game is an historical event and I'd like to 
be part of it, even as a fan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles' trip to Havana drew protests during spring training  
in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. -- many Cuban exiles live in nearby Miami. 
Protesters are planning to come to Baltimore for the game from New 
Jersey and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	But some Baltimoreans are hoping they'll have a chance to  
personally welcome the Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Babe Ruth Museum a few blocks from the ballpark, an  
exhibition commemorating the Orioles' trip to Havana is scheduled 
to open Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Executive director Michael Gibbons hopes the Cuban entourage  
will view the exhibition and the rest of museum's artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're storytellers and this game against the Cuban team is  
another chapter in the story of baseball in Baltimore,'' Gibbons 
said. ``This is an opportunity to build a small bridge between two 
countries that could ultimately lead to a road between the two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Little Havana, a Key Highway restaurant, hopes to treat the  
Cubans to some native cuisine. Owner Tim Whisted said his eatery 
specializes in ``nouveau Cuba'' dishes -- like plantain-encrusted 
mahi-mahi with black bean and pineapple salsa. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make them feel at home,'' he said. ``We're hoping  
to host a welcoming party.''

<HEADLINE> Securities Biz Completes Y2K Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Testing by the securities industry found only  
rare instances of Year 2000 computer problems, and investors need 
not worry about being locked out of trading at year's end, 
officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Six weeks of tests simulated the execution of 850 mock trades  
involving 260,000 transactions for the period of Dec. 29, 1999 to 
Jan. 3, 2000. The tightly scripted tests turned up problems related 
to the Y2K bug just 0.02 percent of the time, the Securities 
Industry Association said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Y2K issues were rare and quickly repaired,'' said Donald  
D. Kittell, executive vice president of the association, which 
represents 740 investment firms. ``The test served its purpose in 
that it helped us detect problems or areas that needed further work 
while we still have time to fix them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our contingency plans will be much more thorough as a result  
of what we've learned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, said he was pleased with the test results. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am heartened by the success the securities industry has  
achieved in addressing the Y2K computer problem thus far,'' he said 
in a statement released in Washington. ``This is a product of the 
great level of cooperation and the seriousness with which the 
industry has addressed this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SIA estimates the securities industry will spend $5 billion  
to correct the problem, which stems from the fact that most 
computers use just two digits to denote the year, causing an 
unknown number to misread 00 as 1900 instead of 2000. If the 
problem is not fixed, it could leave some computers unable to sort 
dates, calculate transactions or perform other operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests were meant to detect trouble in the millions of daily  
transactions between the brokerages, clearing houses, mutual funds 
and investment banks. 
</P>
<P>
	However, each of those institutions has its own internal testing  
to do of everything from payroll to accounting systems -- all in 
various stages of completion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've proven the stock exchanges and clearing corporations  
involved in all the tests can all process in the Year 2000, and we 
did it with seven months to spare,'' said John Panchery, vice 
president and Year 2000 project manager for SIA. ``Investors should 
be pretty comfortable.''

<HEADLINE> Magnetic Strips on Mars Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The discovery of magnetic strips across the  
face of Mars suggests the barren planet once had geology like that 
of Earth, with a torrid interior spurting molten rock and massive 
plates drifting on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Instruments aboard the Mars Global Surveyor have detected  
magnetic striations that closely resemble the magnetic signature of 
crustal spreading and continental drift on the Earth, researchers 
report in a study to be published Friday in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	This may mean the very young Mars resembled the very young  
Earth, but that Mars ran out of its internal energy sources and 
became a geologically dead planet early in its history, said Norman 
F. Ness of the University of Delaware and co-author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``The data suggests that Mars was once magnetic and was far more  
similar to Earth's global magnetic field than had previously 
assumed,'' Ness said. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence of this magnetic field is frozen in rocks that were  
molten when the magnetic field existed. When the rocks hardened 
they retained the original magnetism and that now has been detected 
and mapped by the spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the present time there is no evidence of a global magnetic  
field on Mars,'' said Ness. ``That means the dynamo died and what 
is left is the memory of that dynamo, stored in the crustal rocks 
like a magnetic tape recording.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pattern of magnetic rock closely resembles the streaks that  
led scientists to discover on Earth that continents sit atop 
immense crustal plates that inch about the globe over millions of 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists previously believed that continental drift occurred  
only on Earth because studies had shown the process did not take 
place on Venus, the solar system planet nearest Earth's size, said 
Ness. 
</P>
<P>
	But the discovery of Martian magnetic striations suggests that  
Mars may also have had continent-sized plates that split apart on 
the surface of the planet and inched apart, pushed by the flow of 
magma bubbling up through crustal rifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ness said the energy that heated the rock apparently ran out  
within a few hundred million years and Mars became a geologically 
dead planet. The solar system, including the Earth and Mars, are 
thought to have formed 4 billion years ago to 4.5 billion years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicki L. Hansen, a Southern Methodist University geologist, said  
that the fate of Mars also awaits the Earth. She said that 
eventually Earth also will exhaust its internal energy and its 
molten core will cool. This will shut down the planet's magnetic 
field and allow radiation from the sun to strip away the Earth's 
atmosphere and water. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Mars went through at a very young age is what will occur  
on the Earth eventually,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ness said that Mars died much more quickly than Earth because  
the red planet is smaller and had much less internal heat generated 
by friction and the decay of radioactive minerals.

<HEADLINE> Georgia's Jones To Enter NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Jumaine Jones said today he is giving up his  
final two years of eligibility at Georgia to enter the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, a 6-foot-7 forward selected to the All-Southeastern  
Conference team, told the Athens Banner-Herald he made the decision 
after consulting with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones had previously indicated he might return to the Bulldogs,  
who recently fired coach Ron Jirsa and hired former UCLA and Rhode 
Island coach Jim Harrick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought about staying, then ... with the experience I had my  
last two years, it's really tough for me to make that decision,'' 
Jones said. ``These past two years haven't been a good 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Jones averaged 18.8 points and 9.5 rebounds per  
game, but the Bulldogs went only 15-15 and lost 11 of their last 14 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jones' two years, Georgia went 35-30.  
</P>
<P>
	Jones is the first player since Dominique Wilkins to score more  
than 1,000 points in his first two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones can withdraw his request up to a week before the June 30  
draft.

<HEADLINE> Clemens Goes on DL for 15 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Roger Clemens' bid to break the AL  
record for consecutive winning decisions will have to wait a while. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens was placed on the 15-day disabled list by the New York  
Yankees on Thursday because of a strained left hamstring, an injury 
that has nagged the five-time Cy Young winner for 2 1/2 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of a safety-first deal because it's not anything  
brand new,'' pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre said. ``We'd rather 
give him the time so the next time we put him out there we know 
he's going to be all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, the Yankees activated third baseman Scott Brosius  
from the disabled list and sent down last fall's sensation Shane 
Spencer to Triple-A Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer, who had not played in 11 days, was 2-for-11 with two  
RBIs in four games this year. He was the third man in a three-man 
rotation in left field, along with Chad Curtis and Ricky Ledee. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees general manager Brian Cashman and major league scouting  
director Gene Michael traveled from New York to Arlington to 
personally tell Spencer the team isn't giving up on him, they just 
want him to get more playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shane is someone who has an opportunity to be a big part of  
our future,'' Cashman said. ``The man belongs in the big leagues -- 
there's no doubt. But what's best for us is for him to get some 
at-bats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brosius, who had an acutely sprained ankle, was cleared to  
return after taking batting practice without any problems. The 
World Series MVP immediately was inserted into the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clemens move was retroactive to Wednesday, the day after he  
aggravated the injury while covering first base against Texas. 
He'll be eligible to return May 13 at home against Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very confident it's going to be only two weeks,''  
Stottlemyre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hideki Irabu, who allowed one run in five innings after  
replacing Clemens on Tuesday, will take his place in the rotation 
beginning Sunday against Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's earned it,'' Stottlemyre said.  
</P>
<P>
	Yankees pitcher David Cone said Clemens will be missed, but the  
team has a deep enough staff to handle his absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we all know what Roger can do,'' Cone said. ``The  
beauty of playing for the Yankees is we have other guys to absorb 
his loss. We pick each other up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was Clemens' fifth trip overall to the disabled list, and  
first since 1995. Reliever Tony Fossas was called up from Triple-A 
Columbus to replace Clemens, and joined the Yankees for Thursday 
night's game at Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Fossas is the second left-hander in the bullpen, joining Mike  
Stanton, who lost Wednesday night when he allowed four runs while 
getting only one out. Stottlemyre said having two lefties makes it 
easier for the manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see sometimes where you wish you had another left-hander  
so we can make a move early and still have one left,'' Stottlemyre 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens has won 17 straight decisions, tying the league record  
also shared by Dave McNally and Johnny Allen. He is 2-0 with a 5.47 
ERA in five starts this year for the World Series champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, 36, initially hurt his hamstring while jogging on a  
cold morning April 11, then aggravated it in the second inning 
while pitching Tuesday night at Texas. He was examined Wednesday 
and had been listed as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's something going on,'' Clemens said as he prepared for  
ice treatments Wednesday. ``I've never been this tight. ... If it 
feels good, I'll give it a shot. I'm pretty sure I didn't tear it, 
so that's good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens gave up five runs in the first inning Tuesday night  
against the Rangers. He left with the Yankees trailing 5-0, but 
they came back to win 7-6 and left Clemens with a no-decision, 
preserving his winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens has not lost since last May 29 while with Toronto, a  
span of 27 starts. The major league record for consecutive wins is 
24 by Carl Hubbell in 1936-37 for the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off his record fifth Cy Young, Clemens was traded by the  
Toronto Blue Jays to the Yankees in February for pitchers David 
Wells and Graeme Lloyd and infielder Homer Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens was 20-6 with a 2.65 ERA and 271 strikeouts last season  
for Toronto. He has led the AL in all three categories for the past 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	New York got good news Thursday about Orlando Hernandez, who  
left Wednesday night's game because an old left thigh injury 
resurfaced. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's fine,'' Stottlemyre said. ``Everything seems to be OK.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Against Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the euro and other  
European currencies Thursday as the Kosovo conflict continued to 
rattle the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar edged lower against the yen in lackluster trading on  
Greenery Day, a national holiday in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not seen activity in the market,'' said John Schein,  
vice president in foreign exchange at Generale Bank in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 119.03  
Japanese yen, down from 119.22 yen late Wednesday. The euro fell 
against the dollar, trading at $1.0591, down from $1.0627. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar frequently is considered a safe haven during times of  
conflict. Traders dropped European currencies as their neighbor, 
Yugoslavia, remained embroiled in conflict with NATO allies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is still the case that euro-dollar intraday moves are  
really dictated by news from Kosovo,'' said Jesper Dannesboe, 
treasury economist at ABN-Amro in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro no  
longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on the euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8467 German 
marks, up from 1.8406; 6.1920 French francs, up from 6.1728, and 
1,828.15 Italian lire, up from 1,821.49.

<HEADLINE>  Colo. Prosecutors Near Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Authorities are on the verge of  
arresting a man who allegedly provided a gun used in the Columbine 
High School massacre, the county prosecutor said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be an arrest in this case,'' Jefferson County  
District Attorney David Thomas told NBC's ``Today'' show. He said 
authorities are discussing the man's surrender with his attorney 
and it would probably take place in the next two days. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the man would be charged with violating law against  
selling handguns to minors. The sale of the gun, a semiautomatic 
TEC DC-9 handgun, was a ``private transaction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, hiding their arsenal  
under black trench coats, killed 13 people and wounded 23 others at 
the school April 20 before killing themselves. They had four guns 
and also left more than 50 bombs at the school and in their homes. 
A diary indicates the plot had been planned for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas did not indicate which teen was believed to have bought  
the gun or how he or they knew the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Post reported today that agents of the federal Bureau  
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms on Tuesday visited the Blackjack 
Pizza shop where Harris and Klebold worked. It quoted unidentified 
sources as saying a pizza delivery driver may have introduced 
Harris and Klebold to the seller. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of the Blackjack Pizza shop, Christopher Lau, wouldn't  
comment except to say, ``We are cooperating with investigators in 
every possible way and will continue to do so.''

<HEADLINE>  Stephen Got Even Hopes To Win Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The baby tooth in the pendant is  
encircled by gold and diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the glare, it's not hard to notice the tooth in the  
bauble that hangs from an gold chain around Tomisue Hilbert's neck. 
The tooth belonged to a horse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my good luck charm,'' said the wife of Steve Hilbert, the  
owner Stephen Got Even, who will go into Saturday's Kentucky Derby 
off an impressive victory in the Gallery Furniture.com Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The tooth fell out while the colt was in the paddock before the  
Gallery Furniture on March 27 at Turfway Park, and Tomisue saw it 
on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	It so happened the Hilberts had their sons, Christopher, 9, and  
Thomas, 4, and, she said, ``We made a wish to the tooth fairy to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Got Even not only won the 1 1/8-mile race, his 2 1/2-length  
victory in only his fourth start kept him unbeaten in three races 
this year and made him a leading contender for the 1 1/4-mile Derby at 
Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I'll go right to the Broadway show (the Derby) right  
from here,'' trainer Nick Zito said after the race. And that's what 
Zito has done with the colt who will give him a double-barreled 
shot at his third Derby victory. Zito, who also will saddle Wood 
Memorial winner Adonis for the 125th Derby, won the race with 
Strike the Gold in 1991 and with Go for Gin in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The colt put in his final serious workout for the Derby last  
Saturday when he went five-eighths of a mile in 1:02 2-5 in company 
with another horse. Chris McCarron, who will ride Stephen Got Even 
for the first time in the Derby, flew in from California for the 
workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling to be associated with Nick again,'' said  
McCarron, who won with Go for Gin. ``He knows how to get a horse up 
for the Derby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Hilbert, president and CEO of Conseco, Inc., the  
largest publicly traded insurance company in the nation, Zito had 
the Derby in mind for colt after his only race as a 2-year-old -- a 
second-place finish Nov. 28 at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old Hilbert, who paid $325,000 for Stephen Got Even  
at the 1997 Keeneland July Select Yearling Sale, recalled asking 
Zito what his plans were for the colt. Hilbert said he was 
referring to the next race, but Zito's response was his plan was 
for the colt to be at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Got Even got his first victory in a 1 1-16-mile race  
maiden race Jan. 30 at Gulfstream Park and followed that up by 
winning a 1 1-16-mile allowance Race Feb. 27, also at Gulfstream. 
Then came the big win in the Gallery Furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later the other half of Zito's Derby Duo, Adonis,  
owned by Ernie Paragallo, turned in an impressive victory in the 
Wood Memorial at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the third Derby for Paragallo (Unbridled's Song,  
fifth, 1996, and Artax, 13th, 1998), but the first for the 
Hilberts. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher and Thomas Hilbert will be at Churchill Downs on  
Derby Day. So, of course, will the good luck charm.

<HEADLINE> Questions Abound in Colo. Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Investigators are interviewing a man who  
may have sold the semiautomatic pistol used by the Columbine High 
School gunmen, but authorities said Thursday no arrests are 
imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Jefferson County District Attorney David Thomas said  
early in the day that the gun seller would be arrested ``in a day 
or two'' after negotiating the terms of his surrender, other 
investigators later backed away from that statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Crime laboratory technicians are conducting ballistics tests to  
determine which guns fired the ammunition that killed each of the 
13 victims. If it turns out that bullets fired by the 
paramilitary-style TEC DC-9 did not hit anyone, the gun seller may 
only face charges of illegal gun peddling rather than being 
implicated in the murders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that we'll have some news soon,'' prosecutor Mark  
Paulter said. ``As far as arrests, as far as charges, we're still 
up in the air with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, police arrested a hardware store employee who they  
say made up a story that he saw gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold buy propane tanks, wire, screws, nails and duct tape -- 
material believed used in the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Sowell, 50, was charged with making a false report to  
authorities, a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	Paulter said other people are being interviewed as well, but he  
described them as witnesses, not suspects. He declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not a good idea to let people know ahead of time that we  
are going to arrest them,'' he said. ``They have a tendency to 
disappear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco  
and Firearms visited the Blackjack Pizza shop, where the gunmen 
worked. The agents were investigating whether a pizza deliveryman 
acted as a middleman between the students and the gun seller. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATF and the pizza shop managers declined to discuss the  
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 20, Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, killed 12 students and  
a teacher before committing suicide in one of the worst school 
shootings in U.S. history. Another 23 were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	A diary found at the home of one of the gunmen indicated the  
plot had been devised for a year and they planned to kill hundreds 
with an arsenal of guns and bombs. Investigators have found more 
than 50 propane and pipe bombs at the school and the teens' homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The final Columbine victim to be buried, Isaiah Shoels, 18, was  
remembered Thursday at a spirited funeral in Denver that drew more 
than 5,000 mourners, including Gov. Bill Owens and other officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, investigators said Klebold's prom date, Robyn  
Anderson, 18, bought three of the four weapons -- two rifles and a 
shotgun -- used in the massacre. Under Colorado law, an 18-year old 
without a felony record can legally furnish minors with rifles and 
shotguns, which are classified as long guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson has made no public comment.  
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Klebold's family said Thursday they had been  
the target of threats, which have been reported to authorities. 
``They are cooperating fully with the investigation,'' said Lisa 
Simon, the Klebolds' spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Tributes to the victims continue.  
</P>
<P>
	The San Jose Sharks hockey team brought a 50-foot banner  
inscribed with messages from players and fans to Denver, where they 
have a playoff game against the Colorado Avalanche on Friday night. 
The first two games in the series were postponed because of the 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the Jefferson County school district is holding an  
afternoon get-together at scenic Red Rocks Amphitheater for 
students and their families, teachers and public safety workers. 
Classes resume Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Poland of the National Association of School Psychologists  
said children affected by the shootings may feel afraid and 
hopeless, and experience night terrors, for an extended period. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the time for parents to talk less and listen more,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Sinead O'Connor Takes Back Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Mother Bernadette Mary, better known as  
Sinead O'Connor, has withdrawn a $200,000 contribution to the 
bishop who ordained her as a priest in a dissident Roman Catholic 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	The donation to Bishop Michael Cox had caused a rift in the  
Latin Tridentine church, with Bishop Pat Buckley saying it smacked 
of simony, or buying a sacred thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bishop Cox and I know that the donation had nothing to do with  
my ordination, but I am taking it back for protective reasons,'' 
the singer said in Thursday's Irish Times. She had said the money 
was intended to fund a healing center in Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox said he supported her decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some people were getting the impression that Mother Bernadette  
bought her ordination and that is utterly wrong,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox ordained Ms. O'Connor on April 22 in Lourdes, site of the  
popular Catholic healing shrine in southern France. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican excommunicated Buckley last year after Cox ordained  
him a bishop. The Tridentine group rejects the Vatican II reforms 
of 1962 and insists on holding services in Latin.

<HEADLINE> Brack Seeks Comeback in Charlotte </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Just two races into the 1999 Indy Racing  
League schedule, defending series champion Kenny Brack is talking 
about a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	The momentum generated by a late-season surge that carried Brack  
to the 1998 title is nowhere to be found early this year. Brack has 
crashed in each of the first two races of 1999, relegating him to 
finishes of 22nd at Orlando and 24th at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into Saturday night's VisionAire 500 at Charlotte, Brack  
is a distant 27th in the driver standings, 79 behind series leader 
Scott Goodyear. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly didn't want it to start off this way, but it did  
for some reason,'' Brack said as he and the rest of the circuit's 
drivers went through their final preparations for Friday night's 
time trials. ``So I was just anxious to get to this race. Hopefully 
we'll have a good finish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brack overcame communication troubles last year in Charlotte and  
used a late-race pass of Jeff Ward to get the first of what would 
become a series-record three consecutive victories. A late-race 
pass of Robbie Buhl sent Brack to victory at Pikes Peak, and Brack 
overtook Ward late at Atlanta to win his third in a row, propelling 
him to the title in his first full season on the circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Brack said the key to the successful run was Charlotte's  
1 1/2-mile, high-banked trioval, where he briefly led when the IRL 
made its inaugural appearance at the track in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always liked this track, probably because it's always  
been good to me,'' Brack said. ``There's always a certain amount of 
breaks involved. But you basically make your own luck, I believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of about 50,000 is expected for Saturday night's  
208-lap, 500-kilometer race. While the attendance will likely be 
down significantly from 1997, when the circuit's debut at Charlotte 
attracted nearly 80,000, the competition should be better this 
year. A record 29 cars are entered for the event, up from 24 last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to being the third stop on the IRL's 11-race 1999  
schedule, the VisionAire 500 has switched from its late July format 
of the past two years and now becomes the final race before the 
Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending Indy champion Eddie Cheever is using the Charlotte  
race to break in a new engine. Cheever is switching from Oldsmobile 
Aurora engines, which have won every race held so far in the 
history of the IRL, to the Nissan Infiniti Indy V8. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would not be making this change for any other reason than  
it offers a bright future for us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever, trying to become the first Indianapolis 500 repeat  
winner since Al Unser in 1971, first used an Infiniti earlier this 
year in a test at Atlanta and then used it for another test in 
Indy. He plans to return to Indianapolis for additional testing 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the Charlotte race only translates to a 312-mile  
event, Cheever said it will help his team determine whether the 
Infiniti can hold up for 500 miles at Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got a lot of power, a lot of torque. I think it is a very  
good base to work from. It isn't at its true potential yet, so 
we're doing some thinking and analyzing,'' he said. ``I'm quietly 
optimistic.''

<HEADLINE> Deere Reduces Sales Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOLINE, Ill. (AP) -- Dogged by a sagging farm economy and weak  
demand for agricultural equipment, Deere &AMP; Co. expects 
second-quarter sales to drop 20 percent from the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Deere initially projected a 13 percent agriculture equipment  
sales reduction for the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Moline-based company also said Thursday that it anticipates  
sales volume for 1999 will decline by approximately 18 to 20 
percent from 1998 levels, compared with its previous estimate of 13 
to 15 percent 
</P>
<P>
	Deere officials attributed the revised forecasts to the  
continuation of depressed agricultural commodity prices. The market 
was the weakest for large-size, high-margin agricultural equipment 
parts, one of Deere's strongest areas, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the less-than-rosy projections, the maker of  
tractors and combines said it would reduce farm-machinery 
production in the coming months. Deere announced earlier this year 
that it would be extending annual summer plant shutdowns by up to 
five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter earnings for Deere plunged 75 percent. For the  
three months that ended Jan. 1, the company's net income fell to 
$49.7 million, or 21 cents a share, from $203 million, or 81 cents 
a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterly sales fell 14 percent to $2.46 billion from $2.85  
billion as sales of both agricultural and construction equipment 
tumbled 23 percent. Sales of commercial and consumer equipment rose 
8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks Draw Fewer Spectators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Like the Kevin Costner character in ``Field of  
Dreams,'' Jerry Colangelo built it, and they came. But a lot of 
them didn't come back. 
</P>
<P>
	After 10 games, average attendance for the Arizona Diamondbacks  
at Bank One Ballpark is down nearly 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've played 10 games and our attendance is what it is,'' said  
Colangelo, the Diamondbacks' managing general partner. ``It's not 
like the bottom has dropped out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	True, a lot of teams would love to have the Diamondbacks'  
current average crowd of 34,370, ninth-best in the majors. But last 
year, Arizona drew an average of 46,185 for its first 10 games, and 
at season's end, the expansion team had drawn just over 3.6 
million, third behind only the Colorado Rockies and Baltimore 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	But the novelty of major league baseball in the desert has  
dissipated, as have the oohs and aahs associated with the opening 
and closing of the roof at the $354 million park. 
</P>
<P>
	And many fans were put off by the ill-timed announcement, which  
leaked out on Fan Appreciation Night, that ticket prices were going 
up an average of 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Season ticket sales this year totaled 27,000, down about 9,000,  
the worst dropoff among all 30 big-league teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had an attrition as it relates to season ticket sales, but  
it was primarily due to a consolidation of seats,'' Colangelo said. 
``Because of the number of games, I guess there was a settling out 
on the total of season tickets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, instead of five people buying season tickets,  
five people would go together and get three season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo said concern about continuing to draw fans was the  
main reason he decided to scrap the five-year plan to build a 
contender and spend $119 million on free agents during the 
off-season in an attempt to make the Diamondbacks winners right 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	But even Randy Johnson, one of the biggest names in baseball,  
hasn't packed them in. When the Diamondbacks signed the big 
left-hander to a four-year, $52.4 million contract, his potential 
as a big draw was often used to justify the expense. 
</P>
<P>
	But the crowd for his home debut was 36,105. For Johnson's  
second start on a Tuesday night, it was 30,546, only slightly 
better than the franchise's all-time low of 29,704 set the previous 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He drew big-time in his starts in Seattle and Houston,''  
Colangelo said. ``I expected more, but we'll see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo is not concerned about the decrease in revenue even as  
the payroll rises dramatically. But at least for now, the park that 
San Diego Padres president Larry Lucchino called the ``cash 
register in the desert'' isn't ringing in the Diamondbucks like it 
did a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing for sure, Phoenix is no Denver, where the Rockies  
continue to pack them in. Diamondbacks president Rich Dozer points 
out that in Denver, the Rockies were a novelty in their first 
season, and their new Coors Field was a big draw in their second 
year. By the third season, Colorado made the playoffs, so the fans 
had a quality product to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
	As always, Colangelo paints a bright future.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're very positive and optimistic that as we get deeper in  
the season, when school is out, more people will come,'' he said. 
``We're hopeful the team will be competitive going right down to 
the wire.''

	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Bob Baffert knows he made the right  
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	But earlier in the day, with a 10 a.m. deadline closing in for  
entering horses in Saturday's Kentucky Derby, he paced at his barn, 
cell phone in hand, owners waiting in the wings to see if Baffert 
would enter his filly, Excellent Meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, after a week of suspense, Baffert figured three chances  
are better than two in his bid for an unprecedented third 
consecutive Derby victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We entered General Challenge, with Gary Stevens; we entered  
Prime Timber with David Flores; and Excellent Meeting is in the 
Derby with Kent Desormeaux,'' Baffert said Wednesday at Barn 33, 
where his two Derby winners, Silver Charm and Real Quiet, were 
walking the shedrow. 
</P>
<P>
	``The filly is doing great, I feel she earned her way into the  
race and I think she's good enough to win the Derby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Wednesday evening's draw for post position, Baffert found out  
where his horses stood -- and only Excellent Meeting ended up in a 
prime spot, No. 6 in a full field of 20 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Timber will leave from the No. 14 post, and General  
Challenge from the No. 15 slot. Because the regular starting gate 
holds only 14 horses, an auxiliary gate will be added for the other 
six entries. 
</P>
<P>
	John and Betty Mabee own both General Challenge and Excellent  
Meeting, and the entry was made the 3-1 early-morning favorite by 
Churchill Downs oddsmaker Mike Battaglia. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Timber, owned by Aaron Jones, was the second choice at  
7-2, while Menifee, trained by Elliot Walden, was the third choice 
at 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge and Prime Timber finished 1-2 in the Santa  
Anita Derby, while Excellent Meeting has an impressive four-race 
winning streak and seven victories in 11 career starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, being the favorite is nothing these days for Baffert.  
And he doesn't really care that it's been 20 years since the 
favorite won the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the favorite last year with Indian Charlie,'' Baffert  
said. ``But we knew Real Quiet was doing the best of the two. You 
can talk about the jinxes and all that, but who would have thought 
that a horse that got beat in New Mexico was going to come win the 
Derby last year? So I think you can throw all that out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting also is entered in Friday's Kentucky Oaks,  
meaning Baffert has until an hour or so before the Oaks' 5:47 p.m. 
post time to make a final decision on the filly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now I think she will run in the Derby,'' Baffert said,  
``but I've been known to change my mind. A few times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, also trained by Baffert and owned by Mike  
Pegram, is the odds-on favorite in the Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	If Excellent Meeting goes in the Derby, it would be the first  
time since 1984 that two fillies ran for the roses. Three Ring, who 
won her last two races by 6 1/4 lengths and 14 lengths, respectively, 
is the other. In '84, trainer D. Wayne Lukas sent out Althea and 
Life's Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	If all 20 start, it would be the first full field since 1984,  
and just the 13th time there's been a field of 20 or more horses. 
After 23 started in the 100th derby in 1974, Churchill Downs 
limited the field to 20. 
</P>
<P>
	The most popular post position for Derby winners has been the  
No. 1 slot, but the last winner from that spot was Ferdinand in 
1986. Adonis, the Wood Memorial winner trained by Nick Zito, leaves 
from the No. 1 post. 
</P>
<P>
	Lexington Stakes winner Charismatic and Blue Grass winner  
Menifee leave from post positions which have never produced a Derby 
winner -- Charismatic from No. 17 and Menifee from No. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The other coupled entry in the Derby is Worldly Manner and  
Aljabr, owned by the Godolphin Stable of sheiks Maktoum al Maktoum 
and Mohammed al Maktoum. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner, winner of three of four starts last year in the  
United States, beat Aljabr in a private trial race in Dubai in 
March. Aljabr, unbeaten in three starts in Europe in 1998, also won 
a trial in which Worldly Manner did not compete. Aljabr leaves from 
the No. 5 post; Worldly Manner No. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very happy with my post positions, no complaints,''  
trainer Saeed bin Suroor said. ``I think Aljabr will show some 
speed from the inside. The other horse will be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trainer, along with Sheikh Mohammed, arrived at Churchill  
Downs on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also a five-horse mutuel field, which includes  
controversial Arkansas Derby winner Valhol. The others are Ecton 
Park, K One King, Kimberlite Pipe and Lemon Drop Kid. The field is 
listed at 12-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The last field horse to win the Derby was Canonero II in 1971.  
</P>
<P>
	Valhol got into the Derby only after a judge in Arkansas ruled  
that the track must pay the $300,000 first-place purse to owner 
James Jackson. The Arkansas Racing Commission had held up the purse 
while investigating whether jockey Billy Patin carried an 
electrical device to spur Valhol to the win. Valhol will be ridden 
by Willie Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	The field, from the rail out: Adonis (Jorge Chavez, 30-1); Three  
Ring (John Velazquez, 20-1); Ecton Park (Robbie Davis, 12-1); 
Stephen Got Even (Chris McCarron, 12-1); Aljabr (Daragh O'Donahue, 
12-1); Excellent Meeting (Kent Desormeaux, 3-1); Desert Hero (Corey 
Nakatani, 15-1); Answer Lively (Craig Perret, 50-1); Valhol (Willie 
Martinez, 12-1); K One King (Alex Solis, 12-1); Cat Thief (Mike 
Smith, 8-1); Worldly Manner (Jerry Bailey, 12-1); Kimberlite Pipe 
(Robby Albarado, 12-1); Prime Timber (David Flores, 7-2); General 
Challenge (Gary Stevens, 3-1), First American (Eddie Delahoussaye, 
50-1); Charismatic (Chris Antley, 20-1); Vicar (Shane Sellers, 
6-1); Menifee (Pat Day, 5-1); and Lemon Drop Kid (Jose Santos, 
12-1).

<HEADLINE>  Zimmer May Leave After Torre Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Don Zimmer could leave the New York  
Yankees as soon as this weekend, depending on when manager Joe 
Torre decides he's ready to take over. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer gathered his team after Wednesday night's loss to Texas  
and announced: ``After tomorrow's game, I'm going home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very emotional,'' pitcher David Cone said. ``We just  
sort of sat in silence, then he left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, however, Zimmer said he would wait until Torre  
returned. And Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said that would 
not happen Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, 68, was New York's bench coach the last three years  
until being asked in mid-March to serve as interim manager while 
Torre recovered from prostate cancer surgery. Torre underwent a 
checkup Thursday and was expected to be cleared to rejoin the World 
Series champions Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Torre told Zimmer he may not want to take over right away.  
Zimmer promised to stay on as long as needed, and a decision could 
be made Friday when the two meet for breakfast in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Joe says he's managing tomorrow night (Friday), I'll go  
home,'' Zimmer said. ``If he says it'll be another week, I'll stay 
another week. ... I don't want him to come back before he's 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman said he expects Zimmer to be needed for at least this  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe is not coming to Kansas City to manage Friday night.  
Friday night is not an option,'' he said. ``I'd be surprised if it 
was in Kansas City, but I wouldn't rule it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman said Torre will watch the Royals game in a luxury box  
with his family, including his brother, Frank. Torre wants to make 
sure he's physically ready to endure the rigors of the job before 
returning, and he's wary of returning too soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's down, tired and fatigued, he's not going to be at his  
best to take the reins,'' Cashman said. ``No matter when he comes 
back, we'll say, `Wow, he came back fast.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees began Thursday's game against the Rangers in first  
place in the AL East with a 13-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, who's spent a half-century in baseball, has stayed on  
the job out of loyalty to Torre. Otherwise, he may have already 
left because of excruciating pain caused by torn cartilage in his 
right knee that is especially aggravated by plane flights. 
</P>
<P>
	He had arthroscopic surgery eight weeks ago, but it hasn't  
helped. He's going to start wearing a new brace this weekend, but 
might need knee replacement surgery, which requires more than five 
months of rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, 68, said the knee is 90 percent of the reason he's ready  
to leave. He classified the other 10 percent as personal. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer and Yankees owner George Steinbrenner squabbled early  
this season over the use of Hideki Irabu. Zimmer may have received 
flak from someone in the organization about a gamble that backfired 
in Wednesday night's loss to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers and Yankees were tied at 4 with one out in the  
seventh when Zimmer chose to intentionally walk Rusty Greer with a 
3-0 count to load the bases in hopes of getting Juan Gonzalez to 
hit into an inning-ending double play. Instead, Gonzalez hit a 
two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he's been bothered by Steinbrenner, Zimmer paused  
for more than 10 seconds then slowly said: ``I'm not going to ruin 
my life by making bad statements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his voice cracking and his bottom lip quivering, Zimmer  
added, ``I've been lucky enough to be in this game for 51 years. 
... I came in strong, quietly and that's the way I'd like to go 
out, not to burn any bridges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer later said, ``George has been good to me over the years.  
I'll leave it that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman said everyone in the Yankees organization is thankful to  
Zimmer -- including Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, he appreciates what Zim has done,'' Cashman said.  
``You can't say anything about it but high praise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer said he's not calling this departure a retirement and he  
won't say he's quitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I say I'm going home,'' Zimmer said, adding that he'll live  
in his New York condo and not his Florida home. ``I don't know what 
that means except I'm going home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees players said things won't be the same without the man  
known as ``Popeye.'' Cone called him ``the best all-around baseball 
person I've ever been around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll all miss his presence on the bench and in the clubhouse,  
his knowledge and insight,'' third baseman Scott Brosius said. ``He 
has a knack for saying the right thing at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, Zimmer tried quietly walking away from baseball  
when he quit his job as bench coach for the Colorado Rockies during 
the fifth inning of a game. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Thursday that probably won't be how he goes out this  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm leaving,'' Zimmer said, ``when Joe takes over, not in the  
fifth inning -- unless he takes over in the fifth inning.''

<HEADLINE> Dinosaurs' Culinary Habits Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The books and movies are wrong. The  
long-necked dinosaurs, which were the largest animals ever to walk 
the Earth, did not go around cropping treetops but, in fact, could 
lift their heads only a few feet above the ground, a new study 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Parrish, a researcher at Northern Illinois University,  
said that he and a colleague used a computer model of the neck 
fossil bones of two types of dinosaurs, Diplodocus and Apatosaurus, 
to discover how well the huge animals were able to move. 
Apatosaurus was once called Brontosaurus and is one of the best 
known of dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
	What they found in their study, said Parrish, was that the even  
though dinosaurs had necks that could be 40 feet or more long, the 
animals could not raise their heads much above 9 to 12 feet. For 
the most part, he said, they held their heads straight out or down 
-- not up. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was being published Friday in the journal Science.  
</P>
<P>
	``The maximum amount they were able to raise their heads was  
just a little bit above the height of their back,'' said Parrish. 
``If you raise the neck any higher, the vertebrae run into each 
other and the back locks up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This contradicts the popular view that the long-necked dinosaurs  
routinely cropped leaves from the top of trees and were able to 
stand on their hind legs and reach the highest limbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a surprising result,'' said Parrish. ``We didn't think  
there would be any problem with them raising their heads, but it 
turns out there is a real, physical limit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish added: ``I don't think our study answers whether they  
could rise up on their hind legs, but if they did there would be a 
blood pressure problem. I don't think they would use that as a 
predominant way of feeding, as some people have suggested'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two animals studied are in a group known as Sauropods. These  
are massive animals with long tails and long necks and small heads. 
The Apatosaurus, for instance, is thought to have weighed up to 100 
tons, stood up to 70 feet in height and had a tail-to-head length 
of about 130 feet. Sauropods lived from 200 million to 65 million 
years ago and were one of the most successful animals that ever 
existed. Sauropods fossils are the most common in just about every 
one of the ancient ecosystems, said Parrish. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, scientists have depicted the animals as browsing from  
high vegetation or swimming in pools with their long necks sticking 
up like living periscopes. Most museums with Sauropod fossils 
display the animal with the head held high. 
</P>
<P>
	But Parrish said there long have been doubts that the animals'  
hearts were strong enough to pump blood up the long necks to the 
head. Some researchers even suggested double hearts as a solution 
to this problem. Sauropods continued to be displayed in museums 
with their heads held at maximum height. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study, though, shows that neck bones kept the Sauropods  
from raising their heads. The bones favor a position where the head 
was low, swinging from side to side for grazing. And they were 
always grazing. 
</P>
<P>
	``These animals were so big they had to eat almost constantly to  
get enough energy,'' said Parrish. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Keith Rigby Jr. of the University of Notre Dame said he was  
happy to see some researcher was, at last, ``taking a serious look 
at what has been accepted as dogma in the past. I am not surprised 
at his findings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rigby said that he and other researchers have long suspected  
that some of the assumptions about how well the Sauropods could 
move their heads ``violated a whole group of biophysical laws.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers: Close Ga. Army School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional opponents of the Army school in  
Georgia that trains Latin American soldiers asked President Clinton 
on Thursday to act on his recent apology for U.S. actions in 
Guatemala and close the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Graduates of the School of the Americas at Fort Benning have  
been responsible ``for some of the worst human rights abuses in the 
history of this hemisphere,'' the lawmakers said in a letter to 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Renewal of the campaign to close the controversial school has  
become an annual ritual on Capitol Hill. Led by Father Roy 
Bourgeois, a Maryknoll priest, activists have staged repeated 
vigils, hunger strikes and protests against the school that has 
trained more than 50,000 Latin American soldiers over the past 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The House came within six votes last year of cutting off the  
school's funding, and more than 100 lawmakers are co-sponsoring 
this year's legislation to close it. 
</P>
<P>
	A protest is scheduled for Saturday in front of the White House,  
and acts of civil disobedience are planned for Monday at the 
Pentagon, Bourgeois said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sanford Bishop, D-Ga., a longtime defender of the school,  
said its detractors are ``misinformed or uninformed'' and do not 
understand that the school has played an important role in 
fostering democracy in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that emotions, and not the facts, are driving this  
whole debate,'' he said, arguing the school should not be judged by 
the transgressions of a few graduates. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., who instigated the letter to Clinton,  
said the movement to close the school gained new momentum from the 
president's apology earlier this year for past U.S. support of 
repressive military and intelligence units in Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
	A Guatemalan Historical Commission report, released just prior  
to Clinton's apology, found that counterinsurgency training 
contributed to human rights abuses in the country and that the 
School of the Americas was a key location where such training took 
place, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Chief Ready to Fight Feds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Philip Morris Cos. Inc. will vigorously  
fight a planned federal lawsuit against the tobacco industry and 
seek the reversal of two major losses in West Coast courtrooms, the 
company's chairman and chief executive officer said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey C. Bible also told about 800 shareholders attending the  
company's annual meeting that Philip Morris will strongly resist 
any efforts to raise cigarette taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of federal actions, there are those who continue to  
wage their longstanding war against the tobacco industry,'' Bible 
said. ``I assure you that if there are attempts to raise taxes on 
our consumers, or to tilt the legal field in order to make it 
easier to sue us, we are ready to fight with all our vigor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton announced in this year's State of the Union  
speech that the federal government will sue the industry to recover 
money paid by federal health-insurance programs for treatment of 
tobacco-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Bible asked shareholders to write letters ``to protest the idea  
of any unjustified federal lawsuit against us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bible said the federal actions and the huge jury verdicts in  
Oregon and California ``have combined to depress our stock price 
unduly.'' Juries earlier this year awarded $80.3 million to the 
family of an Oregon smoker who died of lung cancer and $51.5 
million to a California cancer patient. 
</P>
<P>
	``The recent awards defy logic, and we are taking every  
appropriate action to have them set aside,'' Bible said.

<P>
	Philip Morris, best known for its Marlboro brand cigarettes, is  
one of the major tobacco companies participating in a $206 billion 
settlement with 46 states over health costs related to treating 
sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Sweda, senior attorney with the Tobacco Products  
Liability Project at Northeastern University in Boston, said Bible 
``is in denial'' about tobacco companies' liability. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders overwhelmingly rejected proposals to strengthen the  
company's youth smoking prevention programs in developing 
countries; to establish a committee to investigate cigarette 
smuggling; to tie executives' pay to reductions in teen smoking; 
and to hire an independent company to make sure ads discouraging 
youth smoking are effective. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris management opposed all of the proposals, arguing  
that the company already is running strong campaigns against youth 
smoking in the United States and 51 other countries.

<HEADLINE> 4 Suspended in Indians-Red Sox Brawl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jaret Wright and Jim Thome of Cleveland and  
Darren Lewis and Rheal Cormier of Boston were suspended on Thursday 
for their parts in two brawls last Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright received a five-game suspension while Thome, Lewis and  
Cormier each got three games. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble began in the fifth inning when Wright hit Lewis in  
the shoulder with a pitch after allowing a home run. Lewis and 
Wright exchanged words and then Lewis charged the mound as both 
benches and bullpens cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players were ejected.  
</P>
<P>
	An inning later, Cormier hit Thome in the ribs, setting off a  
second brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	All four players also were fined undisclosed amounts.  
</P>
<P>
	Unless they appeal, Thome's suspension was to begin Thursday,  
Lewis' on Friday, Wright's on Sunday and Cormier's on Monday.

<HEADLINE> 2 Adults Shot Outside D.C. School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two people were shot today outside an  
elementary school in the nation's capital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two adults were involved, but school district spokeswoman Denise  
Tann said she did not know whether the shooting took place inside 
or outside the school, J.O. Wilson Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials kept students inside the building as they  
investigated the shooting, police said, and the streets surrounding 
the school were blocked. About three dozen parents gathered outside 
the school, waiting for information about their children. 
</P>
<P>
	One person was shot in the arm and one in the ankle, police  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Anthony Williams had been scheduled to make an appearance  
today at the school, but had not yet arrived when the shooting 
occurred, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the city's schools were disrupted by a string  
of bomb threats that forced the evacuation of high schools on 
Monday and all schools on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stocks ended mixed Thursday after a  
choppy day of trading, with the Hong Kong and Singapore markets 
bouncing back from big early losses but Seoul shares falling 
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, blue chips posted modest gains late in the day, as  
a rally in the futures market helped shares overcome big early 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index gained 46.31 points, or 0.4 percent, to  
close at 13,179.70 after falling by as much as 251 points, or 1.9 
percent, earlier in the session. On Wednesday, the index shed 1.7 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore shares showed a partial rebound from early drops. The  
benchmark Straits Times Index closed down 18.67 points, or 1 
percent, at 1,818.49. The index had tumbled 3.1 percent to an 
intraday low of 1,781.05, but came part of the way back after the 
late bounce in the Hang Seng. 
</P>
<P>
	Seoul's key index plunged 4.7 percent as investors sold shares  
on perceptions that a recent rally had run its course. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations of a possible upgrade of South Korea's sovereign  
credit rating and fading concerns over labor strife had driven the 
market's key index up 7.2 percent in the early part of the week. 
The Kospi index in Seoul ended down 37.42 points at 752.61 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the biggest market in Asia, financial institutions  
were closed for a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar bought 119.19 yen in the  
afternoon in Singapore, up 0.11 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo, 
and above its level of 119.17 in New York overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	ELSEWHERE:   	
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices finished higher as foreign investors  
bought banking stocks. The benchmark SET index ended 9.27 points 
higher, up 2.2 percent, at 432.49. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Shares rose on foreign buying of telecommunication  
stocks. The JSX Composite Index rose 9.646 points, or 2 percent, to 
490.990. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Shares finished higher after positive trade  
figures triggered a late buying spree, reversing earlier losses. 
The Kuala Lumpur Composite Index gained 1.1 percent, or 7.09 points 
to end at 668.72. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Shares ended lower as investors sold most of the blue  
chips. The PSE Index shed 26.50 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 
2,433.49. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Shares ended sharply lower as small local investors  
began panic-selling after seeing selling by foreign investors in 
the previous session. The Weighted Price Index fell 206.99 points, 
or 2.8 percent, to 7,289.62. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Shares fell for the second successive session, dragged  
down by large capitalized industrial stocks. The All Ordinaries 
Index closed down 17.8 points, or 0.6 percent, at 3,104.9. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: Shares on the main index finished at a 12-month

<HEADLINE> Unilever Profits Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Weak demand for ice cream and other foods in  
Eastern Europe and Latin America contributed to a 5 percent 
decrease in Unilever PLC's first-quarter operating profit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anglo-Dutch consumer goods conglomerate reported Thursday  
that operating profit fell to 624 million pounds ($1.01 billion) 
from 655 million pounds ($1.06 billion) during the same period a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterly sales slipped 1 percent, to 6.51 billion pounds ($10.5  
billion) from 6.59 billion pounds ($11.2 billion). The effects of 
economic collapse in Russia more than offset a solid performance in 
Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Unilever said sales in Southeast Asia were beginning to  
recover from the financial crisis in that region. Strong results in 
India and improvement in China helped drive a 5 percent increase in 
Asian sales for the three-month period ending March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	European sales fell 4 percent in part because Unilever scaled  
back on its food product line and made changes in distribution for 
its British ice cream business. 
</P>
<P>
	In North America, sales fell 3 percent due to generally weak  
demand for Unilever's food items. Higher dairy prices hit ice cream 
sales particularly hard. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profit decreased in Latin America, where an economic  
downturn hurt demand for ice cream in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, sales improved by 3 percent in Africa and the Middle  
East, due largely to strong growth in South Africa and a recovery 
in Nigeria. Double-digit growth in sales volumes for most products 
in Vietnam and the Philippines helped boost results in Asia and the 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it expected total sales to improve over the  
year.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Rise Slightly / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages rose slightly for the second consecutive week. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was 6.93 percent, up from 6.88 percent the previous  
week, Freddie Mac, the mortgage company said Thursday. Before that, 
rates had hit a two-month low of 6.87 percent in the week ending 
April 16. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, rates have fluctuated between 6.74 percent at  
the end of January and 7.11 percent in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 6.55 percent this week, up from 6.51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.63 percent, up from the previous week's 
four-month low of 5.56 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages.

	HOUSTON (AP) -- Scottie Pippen made a brief courtroom appearance  
this morning and was granted his request to put off a hearing in 
his drunken driving case. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, playing his first season for the Houston Rockets, was  
arrested last week for suspicion of driving drunk. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing was to have been held today.

<P>
	Pippen was in the courtroom of County Court-At-Law Judge Sherman  
Ross for less than 10 minutes while his attorney, Rusty Hardin, 
filed papers to postpone the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if his client would be exonerated, Hardin replied,  
``Trust me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until January when he was traded, Pippen spent his 11-year pro  
career with the Bulls. He signed a five-year, $67.2 million 
contract with the Rockets.

<HEADLINE> Dandruff Shampoo To Hit the Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Johnson &AMP; Johnson is going head-to-head with  
Head &AMP; Shoulders as it brings its prescription anti-dandruff 
shampoo Nizoral A-D over the counter in a move to be announced 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials are optimistic that Nizoral can duplicate its success  
in the prescription market, where it is No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J spokesman Ron Schmid said Wednesday in most cases, when  
popular prescription products, such as heartburn drugs, move from 
prescription to being sold over the counter, they quickly become 
dominant. ``There is no reason to believe that will not be the case 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not so fast, say P&AMP;G officials.  
</P>
<P>
	They insist Head &AMP; Shoulders is as effective in treating and  
preventing dandruff -- at a fraction of the cost. A seven-ounce 
bottle of Nizoral will sell for $14.99 over the counter. A 
similarly sized Head &AMP; Shoulders sells for about $4. 
</P>
<P>
	Head &AMP; Shoulders, which posted $139 million in 1998 sales,  
controls about 47 percent of the anti-dandruff market. It is also 
the third best-selling shampoo overall in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G makes two other popular shampoos -- No. 1 Pantene and No. 5  
Pert Plus, according to market research firm Information Resources 
Inc. J&AMP;J's signature Johnson's Baby Shampoo ranks ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Diane Berson, a New York dermatologist, said Nizoral treats  
the cause of dandruff, while most over-the-counter products such as 
Head &AMP; Shoulders attack the symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Dandruff is caused by an overabundance of microorganism called  
Pityrosporum ovale that exists on everyone's scalp. Factors such as 
heredity, hormones and stress cause the organism to multiply and as 
the body's immune system fights it, the result is flaking and 
itching. About 60 million Americans have dandruff. 
</P>
<P>
	Nizoral targets the fungus rather than merely treating the  
itching and flaking, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G officials contend Head &AMP; Shoulders also helps kill the  
fungus. They cite a 1996 study published in Cosmetic Dermatology, 
which studied the two products in 32 patients. The study, which was 
done partly by P&AMP;G researchers, found no significant difference in 
effectiveness between the products. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think our Head &AMP; Shoulders business is very strong and we  
continue to believe it will be a strong leader for us globally,'' 
said P&AMP;G spokeswoman Mindy Patton. 
</P>
<P>
	Nizoral, which had $200 million in worldwide sales last year,  
was first introduced as a prescription shampoo in 1990. About 2 
million Nizoral prescriptions were filled last year.

<HEADLINE> JFK Papers Case To Go to Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The smoking gun is a typewriter, a prosecutor  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The kind of typewriter allegedly used by a man charged with  
forging documents that link John F. Kennedy with Marilyn Monroe 
didn't exist until the 1970s, prosecutor Peter Neiman said 
Wednesday in closing arguments, adding that defendant Lawrence X. 
Cusack III ``told lie after lie after lie to make people believe 
the documents were real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case caused a furor in 1997 after Pulitzer Prize-winning  
author Seymour Hersh deleted material based on the documents from 
his book, ``The Dark Side of Camelot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the papers, Kennedy had set up a trust for Monroe's  
mother to buy her daughter's silence about an alleged affair 
between the president and the actress. 
</P>
<P>
	The rumors about Kennedy and Monroe, the Mafia and FBI Director  
J. Edgar Hoover seemed real when Cusack first produced letters that 
he said were between his late father, who was a lawyer handling the 
Monroe estate, and the slain president. 
</P>
<P>
	Cusack is charged with mail and wire fraud for allegedly  
swindling investors out of millions by forging Kennedy's name on 
phony letters. Jurors began deliberating the case today. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Robert Katzberg said that while a handwriting  
expert concluded the president's handwriting had been simulated or 
traced, it could not be proved his client did it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever drafted these documents had years of practice forging  
handwriting,'' Katzberg said. He said the forger needed access to 
thousands of examples of the president's script -- which Cusack did 
not. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't have the discipline and the control'' to have  
fabricated the documents, Katzberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neiman argued ample proof existed that Cusack was the forger. He  
said the typeface used in many of the letters came from a 
typewriter that was not manufactured until the 1970s, and that in 
those papers, the contents are based on drafts contained in a 
notebook Cusack had used. The typewriter used was not specified. 
</P>
<P>
	He also ``had the dramatic ability to change his handwriting,''  
the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 48-year-old defendant from Fairfield, Conn., came up with  
the documents after befriending a Stamford, Conn., autograph 
specialist, John Reznikoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Reznikoff told Cusack that documents confirming a presidential  
affair with Monroe would sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, Cusack told Reznikoff he had found correspondence between  
the president and his late father confirming Kennedy's payment of 
hush money. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents include what appear to be love letters to Monroe,  
with mentions of Hoover and Chicago mob boss Sam Giancana, and some 
described Kennedy's battles to prevent Hoover from blackmailing 
him. Also mentioned was the president's paralyzing addiction to 
pain killers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cusack claimed to have found 700 documents.  
</P>
<P>
	He made millions selling them, then used the money to buy homes  
in Fairfield and Southport, Conn., and Southampton, N.Y., the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Publicity brought with it increased scrutiny, and eventually  
Cusack was indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Cusack faces up to five years in prison on each of  
13 fraud counts. He also faces a maximum $250,000 fine on each 
count.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 37.80 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed Thursday, with blue  
chips pressing higher into record territory as investors again 
bought big-company stocks and sold their technology holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
37.80 at 10,883.25 after rising 13 points Wednesday to 10,845.45, 
its second straight record high close. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite, hit hard in recent sessions on aggressive  
selling of technology shares, was down 41.14 at 2,509.23. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was down 4.65 at 1,346.26. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were responding to a Labor Department report this  
morning that wages and benefits for American workers rose a 
moderate 0.4 percent in the first quarter, half of what analysts 
had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-quarter gain in the department's Employment Cost Index  
followed a much larger 0.7 percent advance from October through 
December of last year. The department also reported that new claims 
for unemployment benefits declined last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The moderate employment numbers sent bond prices higher, and  
yields lower. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.52 
percent from 5.54 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks were big beneficiaries of the drop in  
bond yields. American Express shares were up 3 5/8 at 136 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Also advancing were economically sensitive, or cyclical, stocks  
that have been back in favor since Tuesday. Minnesota Mining and 
Manufacturing was up 1 3/8 at 85 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors continued to take profits in technology shares.  
Amazon.com was down 24 7/8 at 168 6/8. The online retailer reported 
late Wednesday a first-quarter loss of 23 cents, narrower than the 
29 cents analysts expected. However, the company expects its growth 
to slow and losses to increase as it continues to invest heavily to 
broaden its presence on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset  
Management, said that if indeed there is no inflation in the 
economy, the current advance in the shares of cyclical companies 
will be short-lived. Investors will soon gravitate back to 
so-called growth stocks, shares of companies that may not have yet 
produced strong earnings but are expected to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cyclical companies require a very robust economy with  
inflationary pressures in order to generate their earnings,'' 
Orlando said, ``whereas growth companies can make money regardless 
of the performance of the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald,  
disagreed. ``People are not buying the cyclicals because things are 
extraordinarily great now; they're buying them because the world 
economy is seen as improving in the future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks were again taking big hits as investors continued to  
take profits in that sector as well. Merck was down 1 7/16 at 69 
5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues were only slightly ahead of decliners,  
outrunning them by a margin of 8 to 7 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where volume came to 428.68 million shares, up slightly 
from Wednesday's pace of 426.10 million.

Management, said that if indeed there is no inflation in the 
economy, the current advance in the shares of cyclical companies 
will be short-lived. Investors will soon gravitate back to 
so-called growth stocks, shares of companies that may not have yet 
produced strong earnings but are expected to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cyclical companies require a very robust economy with  
inflationary pressures in order to generate their earnings,'' 
Orlando said, ``whereas growth companies can make money regardless 
of the performance of the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald,  
disagreed. ``People are not buying the cyclicals because things are 
extraordinarily great now; they're buying them because the world 
economy is seen as improving in the future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks were again taking big hits as investors continued to  
take profits in that sector as well. Merck was down 1 7/16 at 69 
5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues were only slightly ahead of decliners,  
outrunning them by a margin of 8 to 7 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where volume came to 428.68 million shares, up slightly 
from Wednesday's pace of 426.10 million.

<HEADLINE>  Colts Rookie Is Killed in Car Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts hardly had time to  
get to know Brandon Burlsworth. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you knew you wanted to get to know him. That speaks  
volumes for him as a person and his family and everyone involved in 
his life,'' Colts center Jay Leeuwenburg said Thursday. ``You don't 
say that about everyone, particularly after knowing them only for a 
few days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burlsworth, a third-round draft pick from Arkansas, was killed  
in a car crash less than a half-hour from his home on Wednesday. 
The rookie lineman had just returned from the Colts' weekend 
mini-camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``The common feeling among the players is shock and regret we  
didn't have the opportunity to know him,'' Leeuwenburg said. ``It 
brings up the mortality in us all. Particularly in this business, 
you go around with the feeling that you're invincible. You see 
someone like Brandon who had everything going for him and it's very 
difficult to come to grips with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3 1/4, 308-pound offensive guard started his football  
career at Arkansas as a walk-on, eventually earned a scholarship 
and finished as an All-Southeastern Conference pick and on The 
Associated Press All-America second team. He was the only Arkansas 
footbll player to earn a master's degree before playing his last 
game, which was the Jan. 1 Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, he attended the NFL scouting combine in  
Indianapolis and was impressive with a 40-yard dash in 4.88 seconds 
and a 31.5-inch vertical leap. The Colts made him the 63rd player 
taken overall in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the scouting process, you get to know the young men you  
scout, probably better than they know themselves in some 
instances,'' Colts president Bill Polian said. ``From everything we 
could glean, Brandon represented pretty much everything we want in 
a Colt football player. We were thrilled to draft him and very 
happy to have him here. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made a great impression on those that he came in contact  
with the short time he was here,'' Polian said. 
</P>
<P>
	A state police report said Burlsworth's car went left of the  
center line on U.S. 412 and hit the left front fender of a 
tractor-trailer. After returning to its lane briefly, the car 
crossed the center line again and hit a second truck.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Soar on Tame Inflation / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices soared Thursday as concerns  
about the Federal Reserve raising interest rates were muted by a 
government report showing wages well under control. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 25/32  
point, or $7.81 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, fell to 5.52 percent from late Wednesday's 
5.58 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported Thursday that its Employment Cost  
Index, which measures wages and benefits paid to workers, edged up 
only 0.4 percent in the January-February period, the smallest 
quarterly increase on record. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise was just half what had been expected and left wages and  
benefits up just up 3 percent over the past 12 months, the smallest 
increase in two years, and down from a 3.3 percent rise for the 12 
months ending in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the benign employment cost report should keep the  
Fed on the sidelines, possibly for the rest of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
rose 1/8 point, while intermediate maturities rose between 1/4 to 3/8 
point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.49 percent as the  
discount fell 0.01 percentage point from late Wednesday to 4.38 
percent. Six-month yields fell to 4.56 percent, while the discount 
fell 0.01 percentage point to 4.40 percent. One-year yields fell to 
4.67 percent as the discount fell 0.05 percentage point to 4.45 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.94 percent from late Wednesday's 4.81 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 124 3/16 from 123 13/16 late 
Wednesday. The average yield to maturity fell to 5.24 from 5.26 
percent late Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> 4 Suspended for Indians-Bosox Brawl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jaret Wright and Jim Thome of Cleveland and  
Darren Lewis and Rheal Cormier of Boston were suspended on Thursday 
for their parts in two brawls last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright received a five-game suspension and a $1,000 fine, while  
Thome, Lewis and Cormier each got three games and $500 fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble began in the fifth inning of Friday night's game  
between the Indians and Red Sox when Wright hit Lewis in the 
shoulder with a pitch after allowing a home run. Lewis and Wright 
exchanged words and Lewis charged the mound as benches and bullpens 
cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players were ejected.  
</P>
<P>
	An inning later, Cormier hit Thome in the ribs, setting off a  
second brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Thome, Wright and Lewis had the players' association appeal the  
penalties, meaning they cannot take effect until after AL president 
Gene Budig holds a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Thome's suspension was to have begun Thursday, with Lewis'  
suspension to start Friday and Wright's Sunday. Cormier, whose 
penalty starts Monday, has not decided whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``By no means do I think it was harsh,'' Thome said. ``If you  
charge the mound, you're going to get time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright acknowledged that as a starter, he got the longer  
suspension among the pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other guy got three games and I got five, but that's  
because I'm a starter,'' he said. ``You can't have bench clearers 
without repercussions.''

<HEADLINE> Reds' Tomko Demoted to Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A day after he gave up a career-high four home  
runs, Cincinnati Reds starter Brett Tomko was demoted Thursday to 
Triple-A Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomko is 0-1 with a 7.76 ERA in five starts. In those 26 2-3  
innings, he allowed 32 hits and five homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomko's next scheduled start for Cincinnati was Monday night  
against Arizona. The 26-year-old right-hander was not immediately 
replaced on the Reds' roster. 
</P>
<P>
	In Philadelphia on Wednesday night, Tomko tied an NL record by  
allowing three consecutive home runs in the first inning. He became 
the fourth pitcher in Reds history to allow three consecutive 
homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomko lasted four innings against the Phillies, allowing eight  
hits, seven earned runs and a walk against five strikeouts. The 
seven runs he allowed tied his career high. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomko was 13-12 with a 4.44 ERA in 34 starts.

<HEADLINE> DuPont Unveils New Slogan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Directors of chemical giant DuPont Co.  
Wednesday approved the spinoff of its gas and oil subsidiary, 
Conoco. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff is part of a vast restructuring of DuPont's  
businesses. In recent months, DuPont has made clear its intention 
to focus on so-called ``life sciences'' businesses, announcing 
plans to buy out Pioneer Hi-Bred International, the world's largest 
seed company, and forming DuPont Pharmaceuticals out of a former 
joint venture with Merck &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	In line with its new focus, the company unveiled a new slogan  
Wednesday: ``The miracles of science.'' The slogan replaces 
``Better Things for Better Living,'' which dated back to 1935. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont launched the new campaign with a 12-page insert in  
Wednesday's edition of The Wall Street Journal, touting the 
technological leaps DuPont has made to bring products to the 
marketplace -- from fibers for flame-retardant clothing to other 
advances in agriculture, aerospace and pharmaceuticals.

<HEADLINE> United States 9, Japan 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Four days after a 50-match home unbeaten  
streak was snapped, the U.S. women's soccer team bounced back with 
force, routing Japan 9-0 Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiffeny Milbrett had four goals and two assists and Cindy Parlow  
scored one goal and assisted on another. The United States outshot 
Japan 35-0 and improved to 11-0-0 in the series between the 
nations, including shutouts in seven of their last eight meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the most lopsided outcome in the series. Milbrett had the  
third four-goal game ever for the U.S. women. The other two were by 
Mia Hamm, who had two assists Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Akers, Kristine Lilly, Tisha Venturini and Aly Wagner  
added goals, and Danielle Fotopoulos assisted on two scores as the 
Americans shrugged off a 2-1 loss to China in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has been steadily improving since being ousted from the  
1991 World Cup without scoring any goals. But the United States 
still presents a stiff challenge. The Japanese spent only about two 
minutes on the U.S. side of the field in the first half, and that 
total didn't increase significantly in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States improved to 9-2-1 in tuneups for the Women's  
World Cup in June. Next up for the Americans is another game 
against Japan on Sunday in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Akers' goal gave her 102 for her international career, two short  
of the total of Hamm, who came up empty on several scoring chances 
Thursday night. Hamm put a ball off the right goalpost in the 17th 
minute and caromed another one off the crossbar in the 39th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States got all the scoring it would need in the 15th  
minute when Parlow took a corner kick from Hamm and fed it in front 
of the goal to Akers, who headed it past Nozomi Yamago. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 3-0 after a first half in which the United States outshot  
Japan 12-0. Things got so lopsided in the second half that Wagner, 
who has yet to score a goal for her college team, Santa Clara, got 
her first international goal by blasting a 10-yard shot past 
Yamago.

<HEADLINE>  Foreman Testifies Before Grand Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Never one for bobbing and weaving in the  
ring, former heavyweight champion George Foreman had little problem 
ducking a question: What did he tell a federal grand jury? 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman testified Wednesday before a grand jury reportedly  
investigating whether the International Boxing Federation sold 
rankings and arranged fights in return for kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in the grand jury room in the old federal courthouse here  
for less than an hour. On the advice of his lawyer, he would not 
discuss his testimony. But asked if he had ever paid a kickback, he 
said, ``No,'' and said that this was his first appearance before 
any grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer, Lawrence H. Wechsler, would not comment Wednesday,  
but has said federal prosecutors are examining whether Foreman was 
extorted by sanctioning groups, and that he did not know if Foreman 
ever paid to better his ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	In past weeks, the grand jury has heard from officials of the  
East Orange-based IBF, one of the world's three major sanctioning 
organizations. It does not appear that its president, Robert W. Lee 
Sr., has testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman, of Houston, was happy to talk about the need to reform  
boxing and the sanctioning groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that boxing should be given some time to clean up its  
act. If not, someone should do it for them,'' Foreman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although inactive in the ring for several years, Foreman -- who  
recently turned 50 -- also said he wants to fight the man he 
considers the heavyweight champion, Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to keep coming back until I'm a grandfather and  
boxing is a sport as clean as ping pong,'' said Foreman, who later 
playfully sparred with news photographers outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	At 45, Foreman captured the IBF and World Boxing Association  
championships to become the oldest champion in any weight class, 
and now boasts a record of 76-5. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury earlier this month heard from the boxing judge  
criticized for her scoring in last month's Evander Holyfield-Lennox 
Lewis heavyweight title fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, Eugenia Williams of Atlantic City, told the grand  
jury that no one attempted to sway her decision, her lawyer has 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation here preceded a controversial draw in the  
Holyfield-Lewis fight, which prompted New York law enforcement 
agencies to start their own probes of the IBF. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the three judges, only the IBF-picked judge -- Williams -- had  
Holyfield, the IBF and WBA champ, winning the fight many believed 
Lewis dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them is Foreman: ``I think Lewis won the fight hands  
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said it was not the first robbery the sport has seen, and  
claimed his defeat in 1974 by Muhammad Ali in Africa should be a 
prime example. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy over the Holyfield-Lewis fight created an  
opportunity for improvements, including having the sanctioning 
groups adopt guidelines on how they set rankings, Foreman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal grand jurors have subpoenaed all IBF records since 1982  
on rankings and contracts for fights, as well as checks, invoices, 
expense forms and telephone records, its attorney has said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBF and two other sanctioning groups -- the WBA and World  
Boxing Council -- by their rules and rankings, play a large role in 
determining whom a boxer fights. Boxers who defy the groups risk 
losing the chance to be declared a champion and earn large purses.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Calista Flockhart backed out of a long-scheduled  
interview with the NBC's ``Today'' show when its producers refused 
a request not to talk about her weight. 
</P>
<P>
	The ultra-thin star of Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' has denied rumors  
that she has an eating disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never agree to restrictions on interviews,'' show  
spokeswoman Allison Gollust said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Flockhart had been booked to appear Monday to promote her new  
movie. She also has appearances planned for next week on CBS's 
``Late Show'' with David Letterman and on ``The Rosie O'Donnell 
Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those programs have agreed not to talk about her weight, said

	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken was back on the field Thursday for  
the first time since being placed on the disabled list April 18. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after testing his ailing back in private by hitting in the  
clubhouse tunnel, the Baltimore Orioles' third baseman fielded 
grounders and took batting practice, then said he was encouraged by 
his first workout in almost two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty happy with the way I feel. ... You can't just sit  
around and do nothing,'' said Ripken, who has nerve irritation in 
the lower back. ``I'm at the stage of testing it by adding some 
exercise and then seeing how your body tolerates that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken took 15 minutes of infield practice, fielding about 60  
grounders hit by third-base coach Sam Perlozzo, then hit about 20 
batting practice pitches thrown by bullpen coach Elrod Hendricks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll probably wait and see how he feels tomorrow and go from  
there,'' Perlozzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	A cortisone injection apparently has helped lessen the pain in  
the right side of Ripken's back. However, Ripken is still plagued 
by a nerve irritation that causes his left leg to tingle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels like when your leg starts to go asleep,'' he said.  
``It's not overly concerning, but I'd like for it not to be 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken said he has made no decisions about the path of his  
rehabilitation, including the possibility of surgery. Ripken is 
eligible to come off the first stint on the disabled list in his 
19-year career on May 3, but it is doubtful he'll be activated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still sorting things out,'' Ripken said. ``I've gathered a  
lot of information and am examining the alternatives and 
possibilities. ... Pretty soon, I'll be able to tell you what you 
need to know. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, I'm still looking at both sides, all sides, and trying to  
see what the ramifications are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During fielding practice, Ripken stayed close to the third-base  
bag, where he was able to easily handle the balls hit by Perlozzo. 
He reacted quickly, however, when he snagged a sharp grounder off 
the bat of teammate Mike Bordick, who joined him in the session 3 1/2 
hours before game time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had good movement,'' Perlozzo said of Ripken. ``He looked  
fine. ... He didn't go side to side, but there were a couple hit 
hard that he got to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken hit a couple of hard liners off Hendricks and knocked a  
ball into the seats in left-center field. He did not appear to be 
in any discomfort, even bending to pick up balls in the cage once 
the session ended.

<HEADLINE> Diana Ross, Husband Are Separating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Where did their love go?  
</P>
<P>
	Singer Diana Ross' husband says his 13-year marriage to the  
former Supreme is over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, we have separated,'' Arne Naess told a Norwegian  
television station this week. Miss Ross' spokesman, Paul Bloch, had 
no comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Ross, 55, and Naess have two children. The singer-actress  
also has two daughters from a previous marriage and another 
daughter from a relationship with Motown founder Berry Gordy. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Ross became a household name in the 1960s with The  
Supremes. The group's hits include ``Baby Love,'' ``Where Did Our 
Love Go?'' and ``Stop, in the Name of Love.''

<HEADLINE> Y2K Lawsuit Bill Stalled in Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate bill to rein in millennium bug  
lawsuits hit a political wall Thursday, with Democrats blocking 
further action until they are allowed to offer their own 
amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., pulled the  
litigation bill from the floor, saying he wouldn't let Democrats 
use it to bring up a minimum wage increase and other Democratic 
priorities unrelated to the computer problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the Democrats agree to stay on the subject, he said, ``I  
think it would be unreasonable for me to waste the Senate's time 
with further debate or action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican and Democratic negotiators are near agreement on the  
base bill, which would seek to stem an anticipated flood of 
lawsuits next year when computers mistaking the year 2000 for 1900 
may cause serious economic disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, sponsored by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Ron  
Wyden, D-Ore., would give companies 90 days to fix computers before 
lawsuits can be filed, encourage mediation, put caps of $250,000 on 
some punitive damage awards and make it harder to file class-action 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats reacted with anger when the GOP leadership used a  
floor procedure to prevent them from offering amendments not 
germane to the computer issue, and on Thursday every Democrat, 
including Wyden and other supporters, voted against a motion to cut 
off debate and move the bill toward passage. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 52-47, well short of the 60 needed to end debate on  
a Senate bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said he was  
confident the legislation would eventually pass, but said they had 
to send the majority a message. ``We will not be gagged when it 
comes to our ability to offer amendments. It is religion and it 
ought to be religion on both sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some progress was being made on the House side, where the House  
Judiciary Committee began debating a similar version. The committee 
is expected to finish work on that bill next week.

<HEADLINE> Hawks Chase Another Atlanta Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Braves and Falcons won their divisions. Now,  
the Hawks are trying to give Atlanta its first three-peat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks have a seven-game winning streak, pulling within a  
half-game of Indiana in the NBA's Central Division with less than a 
week to go in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The struggling Pacers, who regained the division lead Thursday  
with a 115-110 overtime victory over Charlotte, meet the Hawks 
Friday night at the Georgia Dome -- a critical game in determining 
the division champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're looking at a confident team,'' said Hawks forward Alan  
Henderson, who returned to action Wednesday night after missing six 
games and helped beat New York 76-73. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a couple of weeks ago, the Hawks were a floundering team,  
closer to falling out of the playoffs than they were to gaining 
home-court advantage in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta had a four-game losing streak after a 91-84 defeat at  
Milwaukee April 13, falling to sixth in the Eastern Conference 
standings. In the tightly bunched field, there was a possibility 
the Hawks could miss the playoffs for the first time since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Not anymore. The Hawks haven't lost since that Milwaukee game  
and hold a tie-breaker edge over the Pacers, putting Atlanta in 
excellent position to win the division and gain at least the No. 2 
seed in the East. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never had a chance to win a division championship,'' said  
Dikembe Mutombo, in his eighth season. ``The door is open for us 
now. We just have to go on in. ... I don't want to let this pass me 
by.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks are a deeper team than past seasons, making several  
key moves to bolster their bench. They re-signed Tyrone Corbin and 
brought in free agents Anthony Johnson and Grant Long. 
</P>
<P>
	Corbin, the starting small forward for two seasons, filled in  
capably at shooting guard when Steve Smith twice went to the 
injured list with ailing knees and former first-round pick Ed Gray 
floundered. 
</P>
<P>
	Long, who spent two years in purgatory at Detroit, has been very  
helpful at strong forward with Henderson experiencing an 
up-and-down season. The Hawks won the first six games on their 
streak with Henderson sidelined by a bruised tailbone. 
</P>
<P>
	But the most surprising player is second-year forward Chris  
Crawford, who was buried deep on the bench last season and didn't 
seem to have much of a future in Atlanta after the signing of 
LaPhonso Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis struggled to mesh with the offense, then was diagnosed  
with a hernia that ended his season after only 20 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford, who averaged less than five minutes per game prior to  
Ellis' injury, has been a major presence during the winning streak, 
averaging 13.1 points per game. He has brought much-needed energy 
and athleticism to the Hawks, whose three core players -- Mookie 
Blaylock, Smith and Mutombo -- are all over 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt if he got a year under his belt, he could develop into  
a good role player,'' coach Lenny Wilkens said. ``I didn't know he 
could start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their success, the Hawks are still a team saddled with  
glaring weaknesses and the burden of never getting past the second 
round of the playoffs since moving to Atlanta in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	Blaylock has trouble beating anyone off the dribble and is a  
major reason the Hawks rank next-to-last in assists. Smith, the 
team's leading scorer, often winds up running the offense, but he 
is playing on gimpy knees. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta is averaging only 86.3 points per game -- more than eight  
points below the next-lowest figure in team history -- and Wilkens 
would love to have ``a drop-dead outside shooter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our perimeter game needs work,'' general manager Pete Babcock  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, in the post-Michael Jordan era, the Hawks are one of  
several teams that believe they can make a run at a championship. 
They want to follow the lead of the baseball Braves (seven straight 
division titles) and the NFL Falcons, who made it to their first 
Super Bowl in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hitting on all cylinders now,'' Crawford said. ``There's  
no doubt we can do some damage in the playoffs.''

<HEADLINE> Earth Imaging Satellite Lost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A powerful satellite designed to take  
high-resolution images of Earth that vanished shortly after it was 
launched apparently never reached orbit, the rocket's maker says. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysis of telemetry and other data showed that the Athena II  
booster did not have enough velocity to place the Ikonos 1 
satellite into orbit, Lockheed Martin Astronautics said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ikonos 1 was a civilian satellite carrying a camera capable of  
producing the highest resolution images of Earth available outside 
the military. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-stage Athena II rocket lifted off Tuesday morning from  
Vandenberg Air Force Base. The first three stages burned out and 
the fourth stage was still carrying the satellite when it 
disappeared while trying to reach an orbit more than 400 miles 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	If any components survived re-entry they would have fallen into  
the South Pacific, Denver-based Lockheed Martin said. Spokeswoman 
Joan Underwood said the fourth stage was burning when contact was 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first failure in four flights since Athenas became  
operational. There have been two Athena I launches and one previous 
flight of an Athena II, which launched the Lunar Prospector mission 
in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Ikonos 1 was built by another Lockheed Martin unit in Sunnyvale,  
Calif., for Denver-based Space Imaging, a company that markets 
satellite data. 
</P>
<P>
	Its images were expected to draw buyers for use in urban  
planning, environmental monitoring, mapping, assessing the scope of 
natural disasters, oil and gas exploration, monitoring farmland and 
planning communication networks, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
	Space Imaging will not say how much it invested in Ikonos 1 and  
the launch, but says the mission was insured. The company has an 
identical satellite it hopes to launch by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Athena said its launches run from about $20 million to $25  
million.

<HEADLINE> Zimmer May Leave After Torre Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Don Zimmer could leave the New York  
Yankees as soon as this weekend, depending on when manager Joe 
Torre decides he's ready to take over. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer gathered his team after Wednesday night's loss to Texas  
and announced: ``After tomorrow's game, I'm going home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very emotional,'' pitcher David Cone said. ``We just  
sort of sat in silence, then he left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, however, Zimmer said he would wait until Torre  
returned. And Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said that would 
not happen Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, 68, was New York's bench coach the last three years  
until being asked in mid-March to serve as interim manager while 
Torre recovered from prostate cancer surgery. Torre underwent a 
checkup Thursday and was expected to be cleared to rejoin the World 
Series champions Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Torre told Zimmer he may not want to take over right away.  
Zimmer promised to stay on as long as needed, and a decision could 
be made Friday when the two meet for breakfast in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Joe says he's managing tomorrow night (Friday), I'll go  
home,'' Zimmer said. ``If he says it'll be another week, I'll stay 
another week. ... I don't want him to come back before he's 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman said he expects Zimmer to be needed for at least this  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe is not coming to Kansas City to manage Friday night.  
Friday night is not an option,'' he said. ``I'd be surprised if it 
was in Kansas City, but I wouldn't rule it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman said Torre will watch the Royals game in a luxury box  
with his family, including his brother, Frank. Torre wants to make 
sure he's physically ready to endure the rigors of the job before 
returning, and he's wary of returning too soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's down, tired and fatigued, he's not going to be at his  
best to take the reins,'' Cashman said. ``No matter when he comes 
back, we'll say, `Wow, he came back fast.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees began Thursday's game against the Rangers in first  
place in the AL East with a 13-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, who's spent a half-century in baseball, has stayed on  
the job out of loyalty to Torre. Otherwise, he may have already 
left because of excruciating pain caused by torn cartilage in his 
right knee that is especially aggravated by plane flights. 
</P>
<P>
	He had arthroscopic surgery eight weeks ago, but it hasn't  
helped. He's going to start wearing a new brace this weekend, but 
might need knee replacement surgery, which requires more than five 
months of rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, 68, said the knee is 90 percent of the reason he's ready  
to leave. He classified the other 10 percent as personal. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer and Yankees owner George Steinbrenner squabbled early  
this season over the use of Hideki Irabu. Zimmer may have received 
flak from someone in the organization about a gamble that backfired 
in Wednesday night's loss to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers and Yankees were tied at 4 with one out in the  
seventh when Zimmer chose to intentionally walk Rusty Greer with a 
3-0 count to load the bases in hopes of getting Juan Gonzalez to 
hit into an inning-ending double play. Instead, Gonzalez hit a 
two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he's been bothered by Steinbrenner, Zimmer paused  
for more than 10 seconds then slowly said: ``I'm not going to ruin 
my life by making bad statements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his voice cracking and his bottom lip quivering, Zimmer  
added, ``I've been lucky enough to be in this game for 51 years. 
... I came in strong, quietly and that's the way I'd like to go 
out, not to burn any bridges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer later said, ``George has been good to me over the years.  
I'll leave it that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman said everyone in the Yankees organization is thankful to  
Zimmer -- including Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, he appreciates what Zim has done,'' Cashman said.  
``You can't say anything about it but high praise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer said he's not calling this departure a retirement and he  
won't say he's quitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I say I'm going home,'' Zimmer said, adding that he'll live  
in his New York condo and not his Florida home. ``I don't know what 
that means except I'm going home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees players said things won't be the same without the man  
known as ``Popeye.'' Cone called him ``the best all-around baseball 
person I've ever been around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll all miss his presence on the bench and in the clubhouse,  
his knowledge and insight,'' third baseman Scott Brosius said. ``He 
has a knack for saying the right thing at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, Zimmer tried quietly walking away from baseball  
when he quit his job as bench coach for the Colorado Rockies during 
the fifth inning of a game. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Thursday that probably won't be how he goes out this  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm leaving,'' Zimmer said, ``when Joe takes over, not in the  
fifth inning -- unless he takes over in the fifth inning.''

<HEADLINE> Cuban Team Keeps Lineup Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Floodlights bathe Havana's Cerro neighborhood  
nightly as Cuba's best baseball players practice in an empty 
stadium closed to the public and the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few officials and reportedly Cuba's No. 1 baseball fan --  
President Fidel Castro -- are allowed in. 
</P>
<P>
	With Cuba's national pride on the line, the final roster for  
Monday's exhibition game against the Baltimore Orioles at Camden 
Yards is a state secret. No one wants to risk giving the Orioles a 
strategic advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one shows their cards and this is no exception,'' the  
Communist Party's workers newspaper Trabajadores said. The team 
will be announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro has attended several practices, government sources say.  
Like most Cubans, he is passionate about the sport, and sat in the 
front row behind home plate during the first exhibition game at 
Havana March 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban baseball commissioner Carlos Rodriguez said the team would  
emphasize speed, not force. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have two or three sluggers, but the team's  
characteristic will be a fast game,'' Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The players ``are training at full steam,'' the Communist Party  
daily Granma said Thursday. Reportedly, the players have adapted to 
the use of wooden bats, which they recently began using instead of 
aluminum ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The secrecy surrounding the selection and practices of the team  
has led to speculation about who will be on the final roster. 
</P>
<P>
	A preselection list of 48 players includes the biggest names in  
Cuban baseball: third baseman Omar Linares, second baseman Antonio 
Pacheco and first baseman-designated hitter Orestes Kindelan. Also 
on the list are pitchers Jose Ibar, who started the first 
exhibition game, and Jose Ariel Contreras and Pedro Luis Lazo, who 
worked in relief. 
</P>
<P>
	For this game, more of Cuba's best players will be available  
because some were involved earlier in national playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles won the first game 3-2 in 11 innings.  
</P>
<P>
	Almost 300 Cubans will fly to Baltimore for the rematch. The  
delegation includes journalists, retired baseball players, members 
of youth groups and outstanding students. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the better known athletes in the delegation are former  
world champion heavyweight Teofilo Stevenson, high jump world 
record-holder Javier Sotomayor, and Connie Marrero, who once played 
with the Washington Senators and threw out the ceremonial first 
pitch in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five school-age Cubans, accompanied by a group of  
parents, are scheduled to play a game Tuesday against a group of 
Baltimore-area Little Leaguers -- just as a group of American 
youngsters played Cuban children during their visit to Havana for 
the first exhibition game.

<HEADLINE> Two Adults Shot Near D.C. School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two men wounded in a neighborhood shooting  
stumbled onto the grounds of an elementary school today, 
heightening parents' fears about school security. 
</P>
<P>
	``One collapsed at the door, the other got inside the school.  
That's what scared a lot of people,'' said District of Columbia 
Emergency Management Director Sam Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair were among four men wounded about a block from the J.O.  
Wilson Elementary School. ``The shooting had nothing to do with the 
school,'' said Police Commander Kim Dine. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials summoned police and paramedics. Police said the  
victims were unarmed and that officials do not know who shot them. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. Public Schools spokeswoman Denise Tann said it should not  
have been possible for the wounded men to open the school door from 
the outside. ``If the suspect got inside the building then there 
should have been security on scene to hold them,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police asked that the school's 512 students be kept inside while  
they cordoned off the block surrounding. Parents who arrived later 
gathered on the playground, angrily demanding their children. The 
students were allowed to file past police officers about a half 
hour after the scheduled 3:15 p.m. dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Anthony Williams arrived at the scene about an hour after  
the incident began. He canceled a news conference scheduled at the 
school to promote a nutrition program,. 
</P>
<P>
	``A crime scene out in the neighborhood washed into the  
school,'' Williams said, vowed to make the areas around the schools 
safe for learning. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials said three district schools received bomb  
threats Thursday. On Monday all but one of the city's 17 high 
schools were evacuated because of bomb threats, and most of the 
city's 146 school buildings were cleared again on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Overthrow Plot Trial Nears End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Alleged white supremacist Chevie Kehoe  
met with a federal judge today after giving the court a laundry 
list of topics he didn't want prosecutors to address during closing 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing statements before the majority-black jury were scheduled  
for today in the trial of Kehoe, of Colville, Wash., and Danny Lee 
of Yukon, Okla., both 26, but they were delayed because of meetings 
with the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge G. Thomas Eisele met alone with Kehoe this  
morning, then with defense lawyers and then with prosecutors. But 
court officials would not say what was being discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kehoe and Lee are accused of trying to overthrow the federal  
government and set up a whites-only Aryan People's Republic in the 
Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors said the men pursued their dream by  
stockpiling military-style weapons and robbing and murdering 
several people, including an Arkansas couple and their 8-year-old 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are charged in a five-count indictment accusing them of  
racketeering, conspiracy and murder charges. If convicted, they 
could get the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	It was on February 1997, that Chevie and brother Cheyne Kehoe  
first entered the public's eye following a shootout with police 
near Wilmington, Ohio. No officers were hurt, but a passerby was 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were indicted by an Ohio grand jury and a  
nationwide manhunt began. Four months later, Cheyne Kehoe turned 
himself in and told police where to find his brother in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Later that same year, in December, a federal grand jury in  
Little Rock indicted Chevie Kehoe, Lee and another man in the 
alleged plot to set up the whites-only nation. 
</P>
<P>
	In court Wednesday, Kehoe attorney Mark Hampton filed a written  
request asking Eisele to prohibit prosecutors' closing arguments to 
allude to Kehoe's religious beliefs, his views on the separation of 
the races, his feelings toward Jews and his beliefs regarding the 
federal government. The attorney said they didn't apply to the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers rested their case Tuesday, their sixth day of  
presenting evidence. In all, they called 35 witnesses, including 
Ohio prisoners who said Cheyne Kehoe admitted to the Arkansas 
murders that prosecutors say Chevie and Lee committed. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheyne Kehoe and Gloria Kehoe, mother of the two brothers,  
testified against Chevie Kehoe, saying he described how he and Lee 
suffocated Tilly gun dealer William Mueller, his wife Nancy and her 
8-year-old daughter, Sarah Powell, in January 1996, and threw their 
bodies into a river. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution put on 157 witnesses and introduced  
shoulder-high stacks of exhibits, which were piled up on a table in 
front of jurors today. One piece of evidence was a 69-pound rock 
that prosecutors say Kehoe and Lee taped to Sarah Powell's body.

<HEADLINE> Honda Stops Electric Car Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- American Honda Motor Co. has stopped  
production of its EV Plus, becoming the first major automaker to 
give up marketing efforts for costly battery-powered electric cars, 
the Los Angeles Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending millions to develop the battery technology, Honda  
is instead focusing on other low-emission technologies, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're highly disappointed in Honda,'' said Tom Cackette, the  
California Air Resources Board chief deputy director. ``We are 
concerned that this violates their agreement with the board to 
continue to produce battery-electric vehicles if customer demand 
warrants it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cackette said the board intends to investigate. Honda officials  
say they have fulfilled the company's obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The program has met both the letter and the spirit of the  
agreement,'' said spokesman Art Garner. ``Our commitment was to 
lease 300 electric vehicles over three years, and we've done 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California air-quality rules mandate that starting in 2003, up  
to 10 percent of all new cars sold by the top seven auto makers 
must be zero-emission vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda's decision to stop marketing the battery-powered cars  
``sends a lot of signals,'' said Thad Malesh, alternate-fuel 
specialist at J.D. Power &AMP; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're certainly being more honest than anyone else about  
electrics,'' he said. ``These vehicles are just not acceptable to 
consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few electric vehicles can travel more than 75 miles before  
needing to be recharged. A battery pack adds hundreds of pounds to 
a car and costs thousands of dollars to replace. Costs to lease the 
EVs are high -- the average lease is about $450 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota, General Motors, Ford, DaimlerChysler and Nissan all say  
they will continue to produce battery-powered cars and will also 
continue to develop other low-emission technologies.

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Michael E. Barron, a supervising editor in the  
Atlanta bureau of The Associated Press for four decades, died 
Wednesday of cancer. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Barron had been in charge of the AP's report for afternoon  
newspapers in Georgia since the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Barron joined the AP in 1960 after two years as a reporter at  
The Valdosta Daily Times. Earlier, he worked as an editor at The 
Atlanta Constitution for two years, interrupted by six months 
active duty in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his AP career, Barron worked as Atlanta sports editor,  
covering, among other things, the Masters golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Golf was Barron's love, and in 1978 he wrote a first-person  
story about playing the Old Course at St. Andrews, Scotland. He 
worked the overnight shift in part because it allowed him to play 
18 holes nearly every day. 
</P>
<P>
	Barron was involved in countless national stories, from the  
civil rights movement to the Atlanta child slayings of the early 
1980s to the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by two aunts and several cousins.

                           *Rory Calhoun    	
</P>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Rory Calhoun, the stalwart hero of  
western movies and the TV series ``The Texan,'' died Wednesday at 
age 76. He had been hospitalized with advanced emphysema and 
diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	He won lesser roles in ``Something for the Boys,'' ``Sunday  
Dinner for a Soldier,'' ``The Bullfighters'' and other wartime 
films. His most important early role came as boxer James Corbett in 
``The Great John L.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, whose real name was Francis Timothy Durgin, saw his  
career accelerate after meeting agent Henry Willson, who discovered 
and created names for Rock Hudson, Tab Hunter and Troy Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun was considered ideal for such westerns as ``Massacre  
River,'' ``Rogue River,'' ``Yellow Tomahawk'' and ``Four Guns to 
the Border.'' In the late '40s and early '50s, he also appeared in 
``The Red House,'' ``Ticket to Tomahawk,'' ``How to Marry a 
Millionaire,'' ``Meet Me After the Show'' and ``With a Song in My 
Heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From 1958 to 1960, Calhoun starred in a CBS television western,  
``The Texan.'' He played Big Bill Longley, a fast gun who traveled 
from town to town helping those who were victimized by bad men. 
</P>
<P>
	In his later career, Calhoun appeared in lower budget films,  
many of them made abroad. From 1982 to 1987, he appeared on the CBS 
soap opera ``Capitol.'' He also was host of reruns of ``Death 
Valley Days'' in the syndicated ``Western Star Theater.''

</P>
<P>
	AMHERST, Mass. (AP) -- John Colt, an artist who focused on nature  
in all its abstractions, died Tuesday at age 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Colt was a member of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee art  
faculty for 33 years until his retirement in 1990, and was a 
visiting professor at Northern Michigan University, Ball State 
University in Indiana, American University in Beirut, the 
University of Saskatchewan and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Colt painted insects, worms and rotting fruit in a way to make  
them look both real and abstract. Bruce Pepich, director of the 
Wustum Museum of Art in Racine, said Colt discovered ``a macro 
universe in a micro world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His paintings, drawings and prints have been exhibited in more  
than 100 shows throughout the nation, including the Art Institute 
of Chicago, the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. and the 
Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. His work is in the permanent 
collection of the Whitney Museum in New York City. 

</P>

                          *Max Hutchinson    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Max Hutchinson, an art dealer who played a key  
role in the sale of Jackson Pollock's painting ``Blue Poles'' to 
the National Gallery of Australia, died Friday. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	At the height of his career in the 1970s, Hutchinson owned  
galleries in New York, Houston and Melbourne, and often acted as an 
agent for the National Gallery in his native Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	In that capacity he repeatedly approached collector Ben Heller,  
who had owned ``Blue Poles,'' a large, late drip painting, since 
the mid-1950s. In 1974 Heller agreed to sell the work for $2 
million, at the time a price commanded only by Old Master 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian Parliament approved the purchase, sparking a  
storm of protest that brought down the government of Prime Minister 
Gough Whitlam.

<P>
                            *Eric Shuman    	
</P>
<P>
	PLEASANTON, Calif. (AP) -- Eric Shuman, a California journalist  
and teacher, died Wednesday after a long illness. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuman most recently worked for ANG Newspapers, first as a copy  
chief at the news center in Pleasanton and later as city editor of 
the Alameda Times Star, part of the ANG chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuman's first job was as a copy editor for the Los Angeles  
Times. He later served as assignment manager at the CBS television 
affiliate in Los Angeles before moving to City News Service, where 
he was editor in chief. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1976, he became a senior lecturer at the University of  
Southern California, teaching editing, reporting, broadcast 
newswriting and media ethics. 
</P>
<P>
	He left the school in 1981 to edit the Irvine World News, a  
community paper. He also served as managing editor for the Clarion 
Features Syndicate, a news features service, and was faculty 
adviser to the Cal State Long Beach student newspaper before moving 
to Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuman is survived by his wife, Cynthia, a daughter and two  
grandchildren.

</P>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Lyric soprano Maria Stader, one of  
the leading performers of Mozart arias, died Tuesday night. She was 
88. 
</P>
<P>
	She retired from the stage after a final 1969 performance of  
Mozart's Requiem in New York's Carnegie Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she sang the ``Queen of the Night'' in ``The Magic  
Flute'' at London's Covent Garden opera house in 1949 and 1950, 
Stader rarely appeared in operas. She concentrated on concerts, and 
was sought out by leading conductors including Bruno Walter and 
Herbert von Karajan. 
</P>
<P>
	Stader made her U.S. debut in 1954. She performed with the  
Philadelphia Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic and the Cleveland 
Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1956 in Israel, she sang with the Israel Philharmonic under  
Ferenc Fricsay in 22 concert performances of Donizetti's Lucia di 
Lammermoor and Handel's Judas Maccabaeus. 
</P>
<P>
	She studied with Hans Keller, in Karlsruhe, Germany; Arrange  
Lombardi in Milan; and Theresa Schnabel in New York. She rose to 
prominence when she won an international competition in Geneva in 
1939. 
</P>
<P>
	Stader spent World War II in Switzerland, but went on to sing  
throughout Europe in the post-war years. She specialized in Bach 
cantatas and masses and particularly in Mozart's concert arias. 
</P>
<P>
	Mozart's ``Exsultate, jubilate'' became her trademark. Among her  
opera roles were Donna Elvira, Pamina and Konstanze. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1950 and 1956, she was awarded the Lilli Lehmann medal for  
outstanding artistic achievement by the Mozarteum in Salzburg, 
Austria.

</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Donald Stewart, who wrote screenplays for  
three Tom Clancy books and won an Oscar in 1982 for ``Missing,'' 
died Wednesday of cancer. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's first screenplay was ``Jackson County Jail'' in 1976.  
He also wrote the movie scripts for the Clancy movies ``The Hunt 
for Red October,'' ``Clear and Present Danger'' and ``Patriot 
Games.''

<P>
                            *Garwood Van    	
</P>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Garwood Van, a longtime bandleader who was the  
musical director for several Las Vegas acts including Ronald 
Reagan, died Sunday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Van gave comedian Redd Foxx his first job in Las Vegas and  
opened the city's first rock 'n' roll club. Van signed Foxx in 1964 
as an opening act for Dinah Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	He was established as a ``society bandleader,'' playing mostly  
ballroom dances, when he took a job at the old El Rancho Vegas in 
June 1942. He remained to become one of Las Vegas' best-known 
musical figures. 
</P>
<P>
	As leader of the house band at The Last Frontier, he was the  
bandleader for Ronald Reagan when the future president headlined 
the hotel showroom in February 1954.

<HEADLINE> Brazil State Courts Ford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Two Brazilian states offered Thursday  
to be home to Ford Motor Company's $1 billion factory after the 
U.S. automaker axed plans to build it in southern Rio Grande do Sul 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford announced its decision Tuesday after the cash-strapped  
state stopped disbursement of millions of dollars in loans and 
fiscal incentives earmarked for the automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	In the southern state of Santa Catarina, Gov. Espiridiao Amin  
wrote to Ford's Brazilian subsidiary Thursday offering his state as 
a new site. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of Santa Catarina love cars and want to build  
them,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighboring Parana state would also welcome the plant, said  
Eduardo Francisco Sciarra, head of the Parana's Industry and 
Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault, Volkswagen and Chrysler are already producing passenger  
vehicles in Parana, and Volvo manufactures trucks and buses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the northeastern state Bahia, the local government also  
issued an open invitation to Ford in newspaper ads published 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 30, Rio Grade do Sul cut off a $468 million incentive  
package that had drawn Ford and General Motors to the state. It 
said the funds had to be used for education, health, basic 
sanitation and government salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	In a note distributed to the press, Ford said its new plant  
would be built elsewhere in Brazil, but gave no indication where.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Teen Takes Gun To School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A 13-year-old California boy with a loaded handgun and a hit  
list of 30 names was arrested at school today -- the most serious of 
another wave of bomb scares and threats to disrupt schools since 
the Colorado massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities pulled the boy out of class at Sierra Middle School  
in Bakersfield, Calif., after his classmates said they saw a gun 
under his shirt and saw him loading it outside. A .40-caliber 
semiautomatic handgun and 13 rounds of ammunition were found on the 
boy, said Kern County sheriff's Cmdr. Don Youngblood. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly have a clear picture of what was in his mind and  
there was no denial'' of his intentions, Youngblood said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the boy's backpack were 30 pieces of paper, each one with the  
name of a classmate or teacher, a drawing and the words ``because 
they deserved to die'' scrawled at the bottom, Youngblood said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Enid, Okla., a school employee found a pipe bomb in a  
restroom of a high school Thursday. Classes were canceled for the 
1,400 students and state troopers disabled the device. 
</P>
<P>
	A middle school in Petaluma, north of San Francisco, was  
evacuated after five devices that looked like pipe bombs were found 
in the backpacks of two students. The devices were detonated but 
contained no explosive material, Petaluma City Schools 
Superintendent Carl Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our level of anxiety and awareness has definitely been  
heightened,'' Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
	Threats and scares at the nation's schools have intensified  
since two students killed 12 classmates and a high school teacher 
in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tavares, Fla., a 10th-grader playing hooky Thursday was  
arrested for making bomb threats that led to the evacuation of 
27,000 students from all 39 Lake County schools in central Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a kid doing something really stupid,'' said Sgt.  
Nick Pallitto, Lake County Sheriff's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	A threat found on the Internet led school officials in Sylvania  
in northwest Ohio to close two high schools for the day so the 
buildings could be searched. An 18-year-old student was charged for 
threatening that Sylvania would be the target of a rampage worse 
than the shootings in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The student told detectives the computer message was a prank.  
</P>
<P>
	A day after bomb threats at seven Detroit schools, the police  
chief promised to prosecute those involved in such incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hysteria has got to stop,'' Police Chief Benny Napoleon  
said.

<HEADLINE> Misinformation Given in Colo. Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Authorities investigating the Columbine  
High School massacre once again found themselves backing away from 
public comments about the case today. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview broadcast this morning on NBC's ``Today'' show,  
District Attorney David Thomas said an arrest in the case would be 
made within a day or two. He said authorities were discussing the 
man's surrender with his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, however, Pam Russell, a spokeswoman for  
Thomas, said more information gathered by police had changed the 
timeline on an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because this is a quickly developing and very fluid  
investigation, the way the investigation went through the night, it 
does not look like there will be an arrest in the next 48 hours,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest publicity misstep in the investigation into  
one of the nation's bloodiest school massacres. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday, Sheriff  
John Stone said he believed three camouflage-clad youths who knew 
the gunmen and were wandering outside during the attack may have 
played some role. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, investigators rousted Stone from bed to explain his  
comments. The Jefferson County sheriff held a late news conference 
and said he was ``highly suspicious'' of the three. He added, 
though, that he didn't intend to give the impression that the 
investigation was focusing on them. 
</P>
<P>
	His spokesman said the sheriff hadn't been updated on the latest  
information in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately the sheriff can't know every single little  
detail in a case this huge,'' spokesman Jim Parr said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone had told the AP that he was suspicious of the three  
because they had claimed to have heard of the killings on the radio 
-- and were able to name the gunmen -- before the names had been 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman didn't address that issue, but merely said the  
three had been cleared after being questioned twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone and other investigators have felt the crush of a probe  
involving hundreds of sheriff's officials, dozens of state, federal 
and local agencies and a complex case in which much of the evidence 
hasn't even been reviewed. Stone's department is the lead agency in 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial reports that 25 were killed were eventually revised to  
15. Investigators first said three gunmen were in the school, then 
changed that to two. Investigators said a girlfriend of one of the 
gunmen bought a handgun and a rifle used in the crime -- and then on 
Wednesday said she actually bought two shotguns and a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
	A sleepy Stone answered dozens of sometimes hostile questions  
from reporters during his nationally televised news conference 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I should just let my professionals handle it and get  
back to my job as county sheriff,'' he said.

	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Pitcher Hideo Nomo, cut by the New York Mets  
and Chicago Cubs this year, signed with the Milwaukee Brewers on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, 30, will make one start for Milwaukee's Double-A club at

<HEADLINE>  Stocks End Mixed; Dow Rises 32.93 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mixed on Wall Street today as  
investors again sold technology stocks but bought financial issues 
in response to a drop in interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial 
average reached its third straight record high close. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 4 p.m. close on Wall Street, the Dow was up 32.93 at  
10,878.38 after rising 13 points Wednesday to 10,845.45. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite, hit hard in recent sessions on aggressive  
selling of technology issues, was down 21 points, and the Standard 
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 8. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more of the same shift that has been evident all week and  
last week,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential 
Securities. ``Again, the Dow is doing well, the Nasdaq is slowing, 
financial and cyclical stocks are in the lead, technology and 
pharmaceutical stocks are in the dumpster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike the trading pattern in recent days, the upside  
leaders weren't confined to cyclical issues, those that respond 
closely to changes in economic outlook. Today, financial stocks 
were climbing aggressively as fresh data showing benign inflation 
pushed interest rates lower in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express was up 2 3/8 at 135 1/2.  
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury bond yield was at 5.52 percent, down from  
late Wednesday's 5.54 percent, after the Labor Department reported 
that wages and benefits for American workers rose a moderate 0.4 
percent in the first quarter, half of what analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-quarter gain in the department's Employment Cost Index  
followed a much larger 0.7 percent advance from October through 
December of last year. The department also reported that new claims 
for unemployment benefits declined last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks were big beneficiaries of the drop in  
bond yields. American Express was up 3 5/8 at 136 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Economically sensitive, or cyclical, stocks rose, also, as they  
have been doing since Tuesday. Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing 
was up more than 1 point. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors continued to take profits in technology shares.  
Amazon.com slid more than 23 points. The online retailer reported 
late Wednesday a first-quarter loss of 23 cents, narrower than the 
29 cents analysts expected. However, the company expects its growth 
to slow and losses to increase as it continues to invest heavily in 
new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset  
Management, said that if indeed there is no inflation in the 
economy, the current advance in the shares of cyclical companies 
will be short-lived. Investors will soon gravitate back to growth 
stocks, shares of companies that may not have yet produced strong 
earnings but are expected to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cyclical companies require a very robust economy with  
inflationary pressures in order to generate their earnings,'' 
Orlando said, ``whereas growth companies can make money regardless 
of the performance of the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald,  
disagreed. ``People are not buying the cyclicals because things are 
extraordinarily great now; they're buying them because the world 
economy is seen as improving in the future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks again took big hits as investors continued to take  
profits in that sector as well. Merck fell more than 1 point. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues were only slightly ahead of decliners, and  
volume was moderately heavy and up slightly from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign markets, the Tokyo exchange was closed for a national  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	European markets fell. The FT-SE 100 index in London dropped  
1.53 percent, the CAC in Paris fell 0.07 percent, and the DAX in 
Frankfurt lost 0.55 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 8.08 to 1,342.83, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 22.23 to 2,528.14. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,670 up, 1,309 down and 560 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 962.45 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
942.36 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 2.23 to 638.09, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.31 to 779.00 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.67 to 432.86.

<HEADLINE> Safety of Anthrax Vaccine Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional investigators questioned the  
long-term safety of an anthrax vaccine administered to America's 
armed forces despite government assurances Thursday that U.S. 
troops are being protected, not harmed by the shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeptical lawmakers suggested the Defense Department shouldn't  
continue mandating anthrax vaccinations until further studies 
ensure there won't be health problems later. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we using our service men and women as guinea pigs?'' asked  
Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., a member of a House Government Reform 
Committee panel that held a hearing on the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of  
Congress, found no data on long-term effects of the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwai Chan, a GAO official, said federal health and drug safety  
officials have only looked at whether the vaccine appears to 
protect people from anthrax and whether there were any immediate 
adverse reactions to inoculation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The long-term safety of the vaccine has not yet been studied.  
Therefore one cannot conclude there are no long-term adverse 
effects,'' Chan told lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its introduction three decades ago to protect mill and  
textile workers, Chan said there have been no reports of fatalities 
or major illnesses caused by the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some of the 150,000 Gulf War veterans who received the  
vaccine suspect it may be a factor in their mysterious maladies, 
including fatigue, headaches and nerve disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen last year ordered all 2.4  
million active duty and reserve troops to get the anthrax vaccine 
as protection against biological warfare. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 220,000 service members have been immunized so far,  
the Pentagon said, with 42 reporting adverse effects -- seven 
serious enough to be hospitalized or take a sick day. All recovered 
from complaints including soreness, rashes, headaches and fevers, 
U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 100 and 200 service members have refused the vaccine,  
according to Pentagon estimates. Those who reject the shots can be 
dismissed for refusing a direct order. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthrax has never been used in combat, but the Pentagon fears  
Iraq, North Korea and other countries -- or terrorist groups -- might 
try. Anthrax is a naturally occurring bacteria found in 
domesticated animals; it can be produced as dry spores that, when 
inhaled, cause death within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration licensed the vaccine in 1970  
based on animal studies and on the experience of how well the 
vaccine worked for those inoculated since the 1950s. It is 
considered 92.5 percent effective, early studies showed. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Janice Schakowsky, D-Ill., said she was concerned there  
were no studies showing how well the vaccine protects against 
inhaling anthrax spores in a warfare or terrorism scenario. 
Instead, experience focuses on subcutaneous infection. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we don't know is just so overwhelming,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Katherine Zoon, an FDA official, said federal authorities  
have received 101 complaints of adverse effects from the anthrax 
vaccine since 1990, only 14 of them serious. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the anthrax vaccine is a safe and effective vaccine  
for the prevention of anthrax disease,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brig. Gen. Eddie Cain, head of the Pentagon's biological defense  
program, called the anthrax vaccine a ``key element'' of the 
military's modern force protection program.

<HEADLINE> AstraZeneca Picks Delaware for HQ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The state of Delaware won the sweepstakes Thursday to become  
home to AstraZeneca's U.S. headquarters, luring the third-largest 
pharmaceutical company in the world to Wilmington with an incentive 
package worth at least $18.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The news was greeted with celebration by state officials, who  
said it was the biggest economic boost to Delaware in recent 
memory, and one worth as much as $50 million a year in state and 
local taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2,400 employees of Zeneca Pharmaceuticals currently work in  
Delaware, while at least 1,600 workers at Astra Pharmaceuticals' 
Wayne, Pa., headquarters will see their jobs moved to Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the U.S. headquarters for the European-based  
company, created by a merger this month, could employ between 5,000 
and 6,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania had been the other major bidder for the site of the  
headquarters. The Zeneca headquarters in Wilmington and the Astra 
facility in Wayne, Pa., are separated by only 27 miles.

<HEADLINE> Silverbulletday Favored at Oaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- With a six-race winning streak and wins  
in nine of 10 career starts, Silverbulletday didn't appear to need 
any extra advantage at Churchill Downs for today's Kentucky Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bob Baffert-trained filly was returning to a track where she  
won all four of her starts last year, including last fall's 
Breeders' Cup for Juvenile Fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's just so consistent, and she loves this track,'' Baffert  
said of his 3-year-old filly Thursday. ``And she's got that great 
move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The move'' is the one Silverbulletday showed off in her last  
start, at the Ashland Stakes at Keeneland on April 3. Trailing by 
7 1/2 lengths along the backstretch, Silverbulletday went three-wide 
around the second turn on a sloppy track, blew by the leaders and 
pulled away for a 7-length win. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Hough, trainer of the third-place finisher in the  
Ashland, Gold From The West, was scheduled to take another shot at 
Silverbulletday in today's 125th running of the Oaks. Even he 
admitted he's got his eyes on the second-place money in the 
$500,000 race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just hoping for a piece of the purse,'' Hough said.  
``She (Silverbulletday) is in a different league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday was a 3-5 morning line favorite in the 1 1/8-mile  
Oaks, with six, possibly seven, fillies ready to challenge her. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a tough spot,'' said Dale Romans, trainer of  
Sweeping Story, a 30-1 shot. ``She's the best 3-year-old in the 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best bet to make a run at Silverbulletday probably was  
stablemate Excellent Meeting, whom Baffert also has entered in 
Saturday's Kentucky Derby. Excellent Meeting was the winner at Del 
Mar last August in Silverbulletday's only career loss, a 
fourth-place finish in the Del Mar Debutante. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert put off a decision on where Excellent Meeting would run  
until this morning, but spoke Thursday of a 
Silverbulletday-Excellent Meeting matchup as though it was not 
likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were running both in the Oaks, it would be a great  
Oaks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, a Silver Deputy-Rokeby Rose product, is owned  
by Mike Pegram, for whom Baffert trained last year's Derby winner, 
Real Quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a runner,'' Pegram said. ``The only way to slow her down  
is to put a wagon on her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert said he was tempted to run Silverbulletday in the  
1 1/4-mile Derby, but decided she was better suited to the shorter 
distance of the Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Pegram said he was concerned by the crowded field of starters  
expected for the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's the mile and a quarter as much as the  
20-horse field,'' Pegram said. ``There'll be a lot of bumping 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's got a chance to be great,'' he said. ``I don't think the  
Derby is in her best interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With General Challenge and Prime Timber running for Baffert in  
the Derby, and Excellent Meeting also a Derby possibility, a 
Silverbulletday win in the Oaks would give Baffert a shot at being 
the first trainer to saddle an Oaks and Derby winner in the same 
year since 1952. That year, Hill Gail won the Derby and Real 
Delight won the Oaks for Ben A. Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	For the rest of the field, focused more on second place than  
history, there was simply hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someday she'll lose,'' said Bob Holthus, trainer of The Happy  
Hopper, second to Excellent Meeting in the Fantasy at Oaklawn. 
``Hopefully, it'll be Friday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The field, from the rail out: Gold From The West (Francisco  
Torres, 20-1); Marley Vale (Jerry Bailey, 10-1); The Happy Hopper 
(Pat Day, 10-1); Sweeping Story (Jorge Chavez, 30-1); 
Silverbulletday (Gary Stevens, 3-5); Excellent Meeting (Kent 
Desormeaux, 2-1); Dreams Gallore (Robby Albarado, 20-1); and 
Positive Gal (Mike Smith, 20-1).

<HEADLINE> Economic Recovery Called Fragile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, disappointed with  
the failure to reach agreement with its major allies on a strategy 
to reform the global economy, warned on Wednesday that despite 
recent glimmers of an upturn in many crisis countries, ``it's still 
a dangerous world out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 182-nation International Monetary Fund and its sister  
lending agency, the World Bank, concluded four days of talks with 
pledges to intensify efforts to deal with weaknesses exposed by the 
Asian-currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	But they left most of the hard decisions until later. Some  
officials expressed concerns that recent rebounds in the markets of 
several of the countries leveled by the currency crisis over the 
last two years may have reduced a needed sense of urgency. 
</P>
<P>
	Emphasizing that markets can often become overly optimistic,  
Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said, ``The crisis 
has abated. But it's still a dangerous world out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin, speaking at the closing  
session Wednesday, warned, ``The challenge that the international 
community now faces is to maintain the focus established by the 
crisis on the need to strengthen the international system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issues that the finance ministers could not agree on  
included reforming the financial practices of emerging countries 
and requiring the private sector to bear a greater burden in future 
bailouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States also failed to convince Europe and Japan of  
the urgent need to do more to bolster their own economies as a way 
to take pressure off a soaring American trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	As the only major economy doing well, the United States has  
served as a market of last resort for many crisis-stricken Asian 
nations seeking to boost their exports as a way to lift themselves 
out of recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said it had to be a matter of concern for the global  
economy that the United States accounted for fully two-thirds of 
all economic growth in industrial countries last year, emphasizing 
the need for the two other major economic power centers, Japan and 
Europe, to do more. 
</P>
<P>
	While praising what he called an ``important evolution'' in  
which Japan has become much more serious about fiscal stimulus 
measures and overhauling its banking system, Summers said ``whether 
these actions will be enough to achieve the lasting recovery that 
Japan -- and the world -- have waited for so long is an unanswerable 
question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Summers also cautioned that Europe must guard against its past  
tendency to ``turn inward in economic matters. It will be critical 
for policy-makers to resist this temptation in the months ahead as 
the world works to achieve stronger and more balanced global 
growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, in his closing remarks  
Wednesday, voiced support for an initiative by World Bank President 
James Wolfensohn that would tie IMF efforts to help countries deal 
with currency crises more closely to World Bank programs to make 
sure the poor don't bear the brunt of the IMF reform programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin suggested that a few countries be selected for a pilot  
program to see if Wolfensohn's proposal will lead to more effective 
coordination between the IMF and World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	At the closing news conference, Wolfensohn told reporters that  
he did not consider it a setback that the finance ministers were 
not able to resolve differences that have been blocked the World 
Bank and IMF from providing greater debt relief to the world's 
poorest countries. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted President Clinton and other leaders of the world's  
seven richest nations would resolve the differences in time to 
announce agreement at their economic summit in Cologne, Germany, in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	On the sidelines of the meetings, Russian officials received  
assurances from the IMF that the agency will provide $4.5 billion 
in new loans over the coming 18 months if the country lives up to 
the economic reform promises it made late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief statement, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus  
said ``as soon as the measures have been implemented and I have 
received the necessary assurances, I shall ask the executive board 
to consider Russia's request.''

<HEADLINE>  Stocks End Mixed; Dow Rises 32.93 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices ended mixed on Thursday, as  
investors again sold technology stocks but bought financial issues 
in response to a drop in bond market interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average reached its third straight  
record high close, adding 32.93 to end at 10,878.38. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite, hit hard in recent sessions on aggressive  
selling of technology issues, fell 21.93 to 2,528.44, and the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index declined 8.08 at 1,342.83. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more of the same shift that has been evident all week and  
last week,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential 
Securities. ``Again, the Dow is doing well, the Nasdaq is slowing, 
financial and cyclical stocks are in the lead, technology and 
pharmaceutical stocks are in the dumpster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Market leadership has expanded beyond cyclical issues, those  
that respond closely to changes in economic outlook. Financial 
stocks climbed aggressively Thursday as fresh data showing benign 
inflation pushed interest rates lower in the bond market. American 
Express was up 2 5/16 at 135 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury bond yield fell to 5.52 percent from late  
Wednesday's 5.58 percent after the Labor Department reported wages 
and benefits for American workers rose a moderate 0.4 percent in 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase was half of what analysts had expected, and it  
suggested the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates to 
curb inflation anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	But while wages are under control, the economy is still growing  
and unemployment remains very low. A separate Labor Department 
report showed that new claims for state unemployment benefits 
declined last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyclical stocks have been on the upswing for several weeks as  
investors celebrate the fact that the domestic economy is still 
humming and hope that foreign economies are on the mend. Minnesota 
Mining and Manufacturing was up 1 1/8 at 85 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset  
Management, said that if indeed there is no inflation in the 
economy, the current advance in the shares of cyclical companies 
will be short-lived. Investors will soon gravitate back to growth 
stocks, shares of companies that may not have yet produced strong 
earnings but are expected to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cyclical companies require a very robust economy with  
inflationary pressures in order to generate their earnings,'' 
Orlando said, ``whereas growth companies can make money regardless 
of the performance of the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald,  
disagreed. ``People are not buying the cyclicals because things are 
extraordinarily great now; they're buying them because the world 
economy is seen as improving in the future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, investors continued to take profits in technology and  
pharmaceutical shares that had soared until recent sessions. 
Amazon.com slid 25 1/4 to 168 1/4. The online retailer reported late 
Wednesday a first-quarter loss of 23 cents, narrower than the 29 
cents analysts expected. However, the company expects its growth to 
slow and losses to increase as it continues to invest heavily in 
new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugmaker Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn dropped 1 13/16 to 55 1/2, even after  
the company met analysts' expectations with a 17 percent increase 
in first-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues were only slightly ahead of decliners, and  
consolidated volume was heavy at 1.21 billion shares, up from 
Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 2.23 to 638.09, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.31 to 779.00.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Certifies Mobile Alabama Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- The NCAA added a 22nd bowl game on  
Thursday by certifying the Mobile Alabama Bowl for 1999, and also 
paved the way for three more postseason games the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mobile Alabama Bowl will be played Dec. 22 in Ladd-Peebles  
Stadium. The Senior Bowl, an all-star game played in late January 
in Mobile, traditionally closes out the bowl season. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA also recertified the 21 existing bowls and gave initial  
certification to the three bowls hoping to be added to the 
postseason schedule that begins in December 2000 and ends in 
January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from the three proposed bowls -- the Houston Bowl  
in Houston, Texas; the Freedom Bowl in San Francisco; and the 
Silicon Valley Bowl in San Jose, Calif. -- will be required to meet 
with the NCAA next April to discuss the status of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Gottfried, an ESPN college football commentator who lives  
in Mobile and spearheaded the city's efforts to secure the 
game.Gottfried, made the city's final presentation to the NCAA 
Football Certification Subcommittee on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He also helped secure the $2 million letter of credit the NCAA  
requires. Much of the money came from the Mobile City Council, 
which approved a $950,000 corporate sponsorship for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is to be used to help defray expenses for everything  
from advertising to payouts for each team. NCAA regulations require 
bowl teams to receive a minimum of $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did our homework and worked hard,'' Gottfried said. ``It's  
like the chicken or the egg, which came first? Well, we took a 
chance and opened a bowl office on Feb. 1 not even knowing if we 
would get the game. We wanted to be prepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gottfried, who promised Mayor Mike Dow he would oversee the game  
for the next few years, said the rest of the details should be 
ironed out in time for a May 11 press conference. He said 
conference tie-ins, television rights and sponsorship should be 
settled by then. 
</P>
<P>
	Indications are that Conference USA will send its second-place  
team to the bowl in the first year. The other team could come from 
either the Big East, Atlantic Coast Conference or Western Athletic 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a city on the move, a city progressing,'' said  
Gottfried. ``We're trying to tell people what a beautiful city we 
have here.''

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines Suffers Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Alaska Airlines has canceled more than 100  
flights since Tuesday, citing what appears to be an illegal 
slowdown by its mechanics' union. 
</P>
<P>
	Mechanics are taking longer than expected to repair planes,  
leaving aircraft unready for takeoff, said airline spokesman Jack 
Evans in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, 35 flights were canceled Tuesday, 52 were canceled  
Wednesday and 28 had been canceled by midmorning Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cancellations usually number about five a day.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the mechanics' union -- the Airline Mechanics  
Fraternal Association -- did not immediately return a call for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Alaska has been able to accommodate passengers from the  
canceled flights on other airplanes, Evans said, adding that 
travelers are being asked to double-check arrival and departure 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based airline has maintenance bases in Seattle and  
Oakland. It schedules nearly 500 departures a day on its West Coast 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
	AMFA has been in contract talks with the airline since last  
summer. At an April 16 rally, union members complained about the 
slow pace of talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's contract came up for amendment in 1997, when the  
mechanics were represented by the International Association of 
Machinists, Evans said. Since then, the mechanics have certified 
AMFA to represent them, and talks with that union resumed last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides recently requested a federal mediator, Evans said,  
and talks with the intermediary are to resume in late May.

<HEADLINE> US Calls Japan Steel Prices Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Japanese steel companies will be trying to  
convince the U.S. International Trade Commission that punitive 
tariffs are unnecessary, despite a Commerce Department declaration 
that those manufacturers violated trade law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next step is an enormous one. That is the ability to get  
what we hope will be a much more objective, balanced review 
divorced from the enormous political pressure the steel industry 
has put on the administration,'' Russell Smith, a Washington-based 
lawyer for Japanese steel companies, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ITC has a history of being more measured in its analysis  
of dumping cases than the Commerce Department,'' said David Phelps, 
executive director for the American Institute for International 
Steel, which represents steel importers and exporters. ``It is more 
rigorous and thoughtful in its analysis of injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps and Smith made their comments as the government took the  
next-to-last step before imposing tariffs; the Commerce Department 
on Thursday declared that illegal dumping had occurred, and that 
tariffs of up to 67 percent could be imposed on hot-rolled carbon 
steel, a widely used product. 
</P>
<P>
	Such tariffs, which can be imposed retroactively to  
mid-November, effectively would price that kind of steel out of the 
U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	``This confirms the significant unfair trade and violation of  
trade laws and the serious injury being caused to Bethlehem and the 
American steel industry,'' said Bethlehem Steel Corp. Chairman 
Curtis H. Barnette, who has been a leader of the drive for punitive 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Before any duties could be imposed, the ITC would have to find,  
by June, that the imports injure or threaten to hurt domestic 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling came just as Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi  
began a six-day visit to the United States that includes a meeting 
Monday with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	American steel manufacturers are confident of their case. They  
blame last year's surge in low-cost steel imported to the United 
States for at least 10,000 layoffs and three company bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese steel companies attribute the import surge to normal  
market forces, including a drop in demand for U.S.-made steel 
during the General Motors strike and a natural plunge in import 
prices when currencies were devalued abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The House sponsor of legislation seeking steel import quotas,  
Rep. Pete Visclosky, D-Ind., said the action by the Commerce 
Department showed ``what I have been saying all along: Foreign 
companies are breaking our trade laws, dumping steel on American 
markets and putting American steel workers out of work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brink Lindsey, director of the Center for Trade Policies Studies  
at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the action, if it leads to 
the imposition of tariffs, is ``a short-term victory for U.S. steel 
makers and a long-term loss for U.S. steel users, who employ 40 
times as many people as steel producers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department still must issue final determinations on  
whether tariffs should be imposed against Brazil and Russia for 
their hot-rolled steel shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on Brazil has been delayed until July 6. A ruling on  
Russia is due June 10, but that country may be able to avoid 
tariffs if its agreement to curb steel shipments to the United 
States is ratified by both countries.

<HEADLINE>  Colo. Prosecutors Near Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Authorities are on the verge of  
arresting a man who allegedly sold the semiautomatic handgun used 
in the Columbine High School massacre, the county prosecutor said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be an arrest in this case,'' Jefferson County  
District Attorney David Thomas told NBC's ``Today'' show. He said 
authorities are discussing the man's surrender with his attorney 
and it would probably take place in the next two days. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the man would be charged with violating law against  
selling handguns to minors. The sale of the gun, a semiautomatic 
TEC DC-9 handgun, was a ``private transaction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, hiding their arsenal  
under black trench coats, killed 13 people and wounded 23 others at 
the school April 20 before killing themselves. They had four guns 
and also left more than 50 bombs at the school and in their homes. 
A diary indicates the plot had been planned for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas did not indicate which teen was believed to have bought  
the gun or how he or they knew the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Post reported today that agents of the federal Bureau  
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms on Tuesday visited the Blackjack 
Pizza shop where Harris and Klebold worked. It quoted unidentified 
sources as saying a pizza delivery driver may have introduced 
Harris and Klebold to the seller. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of the Blackjack Pizza shop, Christopher Lau, wouldn't  
comment except to say, ``We are cooperating with investigators in 
every possible way and will continue to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the other three guns -- two shotguns and a rifle  
-- used in the massacre were bought by Robyn Anderson, Klebold's 
girlfriend, shortly after she turned 18 last fall. They describe 
her as a witness rather than a suspect in the rampage, because it 
is not illegal to provide a shotgun or a rifle to a minor. 
</P>
<P>
	``She did buy the long guns,'' sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis  
said. ``Did she supply the weapons to them with some idea of what 
they were planning to do with them? That's still one of the major 
things we want to find out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Ms. Anderson bought the shotguns and rifle  
after her 18th birthday in November. Investigators said at least 
one was bought at a gun show. Federal law allows persons 18 years 
of age to buy rifles and shotguns, but not handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeated efforts to reach Ms. Anderson at home and by phone for  
comment have been unsuccessful. Investigators say she has retained 
an attorney and has been cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson, who attended the prom with Klebold days before the  
shootings, is just one of 600-plus leads being pursued in 
Colorado's largest-ever criminal probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of those 600 could throw anybody back into the focus of  
the investigation,'' Davis said. ``We're conducting this 
investigation as if there are more suspects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners drained by a week of funerals turned today to the final  
service for the Columbine victims. Witnesses say the gunmen killed 
Isaiah Shoels, 18, because he was black. 
</P>
<P>
	Anguished by the bloodshed at Columbine, people across the  
country are talking about school safety, parental responsibility, 
gun control and violence in movies, music and video games. With 
Vice President Al Gore in attendance, cable network MSNBC staged a 
town meeting Wednesday night focusing on the shootings, and CNN 
planned its own tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack has also produced a disturbing series of copycat  
crimes, including Wednesday's shooting of two 17-year-old boys at a 
Taber, Alberta, high school. One of the boys died after a 
14-year-old boy walked into the school and opened fire, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, educators have increased security and at least a  
half-dozen law enforcement agencies have arrested youngsters 
accused of plotting weapons attacks at school. A number of school 
districts have banned trench coats. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same school district as Columbine, a phony bomb threat on  
Wednesday forced students to evacuate Pomona High School. No 
explosives were found. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wackos are coming out of the woodwork,'' said another  
sheriff's spokesman, Sgt. Jim Parr. ``A lot of sick people think 
this is something to emulate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the leads is the medical problem cited by the Marines  
Corps when it rejected Harris as a recruit just five days before 
the attack. Harris was rejected because he had been taking the 
antidepressant drug Luvox, The New York Times reported today, 
citing a Defense Department source. Luvox is often used to treat 
obsessive-compulsive disorder in children and adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they were interested in whether Harris'  
condition could be linked to the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``His acceptance or nonacceptance into the Marine Corps I don't  
think has any bearing on what happened,'' Parr said. ``But if he 
were on medication or not on medication, that would be part of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coroner's office said tests showed no drugs or alcohol in  
the bodies of the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, a federal official told The Associated Press  
that the FBI has enhanced a surveillance videotape that captured 
events in the cafeteria, where several students were wounded during 
the rampage. The tape was returned to Colorado for analysis.

<HEADLINE> Drug Testing in Schools Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two House Republicans are seeking federally  
funded drug testing in schools as a way to reduce youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the proposals, announced Wednesday, said random  
testing would help arm parents with the facts as they confront 
their children about drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	``The number one fear of parents, grandparents and family  
members is `Does my child have access to illegal drugs?''' Rep. 
John Peterson, R-Pa., said at a news conference. ``The only way to 
have drug-free schools is to follow the successful program of the 
military and the workplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department already has a drug-testing policy, as do  
many private companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson's measure would authorize school districts to conduct  
random testing unless parents decline to participate, while a bill 
by Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., would require parental consent. The 
Rogan bill also provides $500 million for drug counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing of a child's drug habit is only the first step,''  
Rogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Bensinger, an anti-drug consultant and administrator of  
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration under President Ford, said 
the tests would let parents know to get help for their children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without question, people that test positive for drugs are more  
violent, most likely to commit crimes and most likely to be absent 
and have problems,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson said reduction in drug use could help prevent rampages  
such as last week's shootings in Littleton, Colo., from being a 
regular occurrence. Toxicology tests revealed no drugs or alcohol 
in the bodies of the Colorado gunmen, but Peterson said there have 
been incidents elsewhere that involved drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both bills would keep results from law-enforcement officials,  
although Peterson's calls for the school to be notified when there 
is a second positive test result. In other cases, the test results 
would go directly to the parents. 
</P>
<P>
	DeForest Rathbone, chairman of the National Institute of Citizen  
Anti-drug Policy, said the legislation would probably be challenged 
in court, but he thought it would survive. He said more than 100 
school districts in up to 20 states already test some students. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court in 1995 ruled in an Oregon case that random  
drug tests for student athletes do not violate the Constitution's 
Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches. But no 
court has ever condoned the random testing of all public school 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to $500 million for drug counseling, Rogan's bill  
would authorize $500 million for the tests of children grades 9 to 
12. Peterson's bill sets no funding level for the tests, which 
would apply to children grades 7 to 12. His bill would require a 
state or local school district to cover half of the testing costs.

<HEADLINE> Government To Relax 'Dolphin-Safe' Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It may say ``dolphin safe'' on the can of  
tuna, but then -- maybe it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, acting at the direction of Congress,  
is giving the go-ahead for processors and canners to use tuna 
caught by using large, encircling nets that also can snare dolphins 
and still label it ``dolphin safe'' in retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
	A formal announcement of the dolphin-tuna decision was to be  
made by the Commerce Department today, according to administration 
and congressional sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of encircling nets to catch tuna was once said to kill  
more than 100,000 dolphins a year, prompting an import ban in 1990 
of tuna caught by encirclement. That, in turn resulted in all tuna 
sold in the United States to be marked ``dolphin safe'' -- a label 
that has been around for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The dolphin death toll has declined dramatically to less than  
3,000 a year, and Congress in 1997 said the entire issue should be 
re-examined. It lifted the import embargo and directed a review on 
whether there should be a change in how the label is used. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department was to announce today that it had found  
``insufficient evidence'' to conclude tuna encirclement has a 
significant impact on dolphins, officials said. As a result, the 
label may be used, as directed by Congress, on all tuna, no matter 
how it is caught. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how much impact the change would have on grocery  
shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	Wary of a possible consumer backlash and already facing a glut  
in the tuna market, the three major tuna processors -- Star-Kist, 
Chicken of the Sea and Bumble Bee -- have said they would continue 
using only tuna caught by methods other than encirclement. The 
three processors share about 90 percent of the U.S. tuna market. 
</P>
<P>
	But some conservationists say the change may allow some  
store-brand tuna to carry a ``dolphin safe'' label no matter how 
the fish is caught and confuse consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will cheapen the label. It will confuse consumers,'' said  
John Fitzgerald, who as an environmental lobbyist helped write the 
legislation in 1990 that led to the ``dolphin safe'' labeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's consumer fraud and a death warrant for thousands of  
dolphin,'' insisted David Phillips, director of Earth Island 
Institute's marine mammal project near San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Marine Fisheries Service under the 1997 law is  
required to pursue further studies and make another review in 2002 
on whether the use of large encircling nets to catch tuna causes 
``significant adverse impact'' on dolphin that swim with tuna. 
</P>
<P>
	If they find the impact is significant, the definition of  
``dolphin safe'' may once again change, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile the conservation community is anything but united on  
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Some environmentalists as well as lawmakers cite statistics that  
show the number of dolphins has not increased, although mortalities 
have declined sharply over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., wrote Commerce Secretary William  
Daley earlier this week, urging that the ``dolphin label'' remain 
as is ``until we ensure that dolphin stocks are actually 
recovering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the lifting of the import embargo and change in labeling  
criteria has had support from such groups as Greenpeace, the Center 
for Marine Conservation and the Environmental Defense Fund. They 
all argue that the usefulness of the U.S. import ban has passed and 
that further restrictions -- including the current definition of the 
label -- only blocks international action to protect the dolphin and 
other marine life. 
</P>
<P>
	They say that the ``dolphin safe'' label as it now is defined  
stands in the way of international action because other countries, 
including Mexico, will not participate in dolphin protection unless 
the U.S. market is reopened without restrictions.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Cops Deny Motel Race Profiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey State Police deny that race  
plays a part in a crime-fighting operation in which motel employees 
are recruited to be on the lookout for suspicious guests. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-year-old effort to stop drug shipments is under review  
by the state Attorney General's office to determine whether it 
unfairly targets minorities, The Star-Ledger of Newark reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper, citing law enforcement sources, said police  
investigators told hotel desk clerks to pay particular attention to 
Hispanics from Florida who carry lots of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Clo Smith, a clerk at the Holiday Inn near Newark International  
Airport, said a detective suggested Spanish-speaking guests should 
be treated with more suspicion than those who speak English. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's just say I found it somewhat insensitive,'' she said in  
today's New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	But police spokesman John Hagerty denied that racial profiling  
was an element of the program. He said the effort, run by the 
Narcotics Enforcement Bureau, has been a successful method of 
arresting drug traffickers along the New Jersey Turnpike. 
</P>
<P>
	``Race and ethnicity are not part of any training used by the  
detectives assigned to this unit,'' Hagerty said. ``Nor is race or 
ethnicity part of any criminal factor indicator used in conducting 
investigations into illegal narcotics trafficking in the state of 
New Jersey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The review by investigators working under Attorney General Peter  
Verniero is part of a wide-ranging examination of police training, 
procedures and practices in dealing with minority suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	Verniero last week issued a preliminary report confirming there  
was evidence of racial profiling -- the practice of stopping 
motorists solely on the basis of their ethnicity -- within Turnpike 
patrol units. 
</P>
<P>
	Except to confirm a general review of state police training in  
various drug interdiction activities, Assistant Attorney General 
Paul Zoubek refused to discuss the motel program. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department also has been investigating racial  
profiling allegations against New Jersey's state police. Similar 
accusations have been made in Florida, Maryland, Connecticut and 
elsewhere along the Interstate 95 corridor.

<HEADLINE> Dallas Mayor Seeks Second Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Four years after Ron Kirk fought his way through a  
10-candidate field to become Dallas' first black mayor, he faces 
two lightly regarded challengers Saturday in his bid for a second 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk is running against immigration lawyer and political novice  
Margaret A. Donnelly and perennial candidate Billy Jack Ludwig. 
</P>
<P>
	During his first term, Kirk pushed through referendums to build  
a sports arena and develop an area along the Trinity River near 
downtown. Each passed by fewer than 2,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk, a lawyer and former Texas secretary of state, said he is  
optimistic that voters ``aren't looking for a lot of change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is overwhelmingly positive feeling about the direction  
the city is going,'' he said. ``We've had two controversial 
referendums. People like that I tell them what I'm going to try to 
do and then go out and do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk said he will focus his second term on fixing streets,  
keeping the city safe and promoting economic development in south 
Dallas, the poorest part of town. Critics argue he has focused on 
grand projects that exist only in architectural drawings while 
ignoring crumbling roads and poor schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too many of our resources are being directed to economic  
development and not enough to education,'' Ms. Donnelly said. 
``Recreation centers in Dallas are closing between noon and 2 p.m. 
on Saturdays, just when they're most desperately needed.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Stocks End Mixed; Dow Rises 32.93 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices ended mixed on Thursday, as  
investors again sold technology stocks but bought financial issues 
in response to a drop in bond market interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average reached its third straight  
record high close, adding 32.93 to end at 10,878.38. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite, hit hard in recent sessions on aggressive  
selling of technology issues, fell 21.93 to 2,528.44, and the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index declined 8.08 at 1,342.83. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more of the same shift that has been evident all week and  
last week,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential 
Securities. ``Again, the Dow is doing well, the Nasdaq is slowing, 
financial and cyclical stocks are in the lead, technology and 
pharmaceutical stocks are in the dumpster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Market leadership has expanded beyond cyclical issues, those  
that respond closely to changes in economic outlook. Financial 
stocks climbed aggressively Thursday as fresh data showing benign 
inflation pushed interest rates lower in the bond market. American 
Express was up 2 5/16 at 135 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury bond yield fell to 5.52 percent from late  
Wednesday's 5.58 percent after the Labor Department reported wages 
and benefits for American workers rose a moderate 0.4 percent in 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase was half of what analysts had expected, and it  
suggested the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates to 
curb inflation anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	But while wages are under control, the economy is still growing  
and unemployment remains very low. A separate Labor Department 
report showed that new claims for state unemployment benefits 
declined last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyclical stocks have been on the upswing for several weeks as  
investors celebrate the fact that the domestic economy is still 
humming and hope that foreign economies are on the mend. Minnesota 
Mining and Manufacturing was up 1 1/8 at 85 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset  
Management, said that if indeed there is no inflation in the 
economy, the current advance in the shares of cyclical companies 
will be short-lived. Investors will soon gravitate back to growth 
stocks, shares of companies that may not have yet produced strong 
earnings but are expected to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cyclical companies require a very robust economy with  
inflationary pressures in order to generate their earnings,'' 
Orlando said, ``whereas growth companies can make money regardless 
of the performance of the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald,  
disagreed. ``People are not buying the cyclicals because things are 
extraordinarily great now; they're buying them because the world 
economy is seen as improving in the future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, investors continued to take profits in technology and  
pharmaceutical shares that had soared until recent sessions. 
Amazon.com slid 25 1/4 to 168 1/4. The online retailer reported late 
Wednesday a first-quarter loss of 23 cents, narrower than the 29 
cents analysts expected. However, the company expects its growth to 
slow and losses to increase as it continues to invest heavily in 
new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugmaker Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn dropped 1 13/16 to 55 1/2, even after  
the company met analysts' expectations with a 17 percent increase 
in first-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues were only slightly ahead of decliners, and  
consolidated volume was heavy at 1.21 billion shares, up from 
Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 2.23 to 638.09, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.31 to 779.00. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.68 to 432.85.  
</P>
<P>
	In foreign markets, the Tokyo exchange was closed for a national  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	European markets closed lower. The FT-SE 100 index in London  
dropped 1.53 percent, the CAC in Paris fell 0.07 percent, and the 
DAX in Frankfurt lost 0.55 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton OKs Schools Flexibility Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed legislation today  
giving states greater freedom in spending federal education dollars 
-- a modest achievement by Republicans and Democrats that was 
accorded a Rose Garden ceremony to showcase possibilities for 
bipartisanship. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, there have been days in the last few years when I'm  
not sure we could have gotten this many members of Congress to 
agree that today is Thursday,'' Clinton joked as he surveyed the 
dozen or more lawmakers witnessing his enactment of the ``Ed-Flex'' 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope now we're getting off to a good start and we'll keep on  
doing this,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar spirit, Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., said, ``I hope  
this is simply the first accomplishment. ... We must continue along 
this path'' of working together to improve schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Remarks from both sides of the aisle, however, suggested that  
was no sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Flexibility Partnership Act allows all states to  
receive waivers of certain federal education requirements in order 
to improve school and student performance. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton, before painstakingly marking his signature on the  
bill with more than a dozen pens that would become the lawmakers' 
souvenirs, threatened to undo the legislation if it didn't work the 
way Republican sponsors promised. 
</P>
<P>
	If states and school districts did not use their new flexibility  
to produce measurable results, Clinton said, ``and the money's 
being misspent under this law, then we'll revert to another 
system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pressed the GOP majority in Congress to take up his own  
education agenda: massive new federal funds for hiring teachers, 
modernizing and building schools, and testing students against 
national standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, in turn, criticized the Democrats' agenda as a  
``one-size-fits-all'' approach to fixing the nation's schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge President Clinton and his colleagues in Congress to  
help us to eliminate the federal middleman in Washington and 
empower our teachers and parents to improve public education at the 
local level,'' Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., chairman of the House 
Republican Conference, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed-Flex, which was the first substantive bill to emerge from the  
post-impeachment Congress, was approved overwhelmingly in the House 
and Senate last week. Its passage was cheered by Republicans who 
advocate allowing more local authority over nearly $11 billion in 
education spending this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation expands to all 50 states and the District of  
Columbia a program established in 1994 that freed 12 states and 
school districts from some rules for obtaining federal funds and 
let them establish their own programs under which they would be 
accountable for academic results. 
</P>
<P>
	It authorizes the Education Secretary to deny Ed-Flex status to  
states that fail to develop strict standards and assessments for 
measuring the progress of students and school districts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called for an expansion of the Ed-Flex pilot program  
last year in a speech to the National Governors' Association. 
</P>
<P>
	To stave off a threatened presidential veto, Republicans had to  
give up a provision allowing a portion of the $1.2 billion in this 
year's budget for Clinton's new teacher program to be used for 
special education needs. Instead, the bill says school districts 
with class sizes of 18 or fewer students may join with other 
districts to use the money for teacher training.

<HEADLINE> Old Ky. Home Is for Race Horses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The state of Kentucky has donated 100  
acres of farmland valued at more than $1 million to become a home 
for retired racehorses, Gov. Paul Patton said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The facility, which will be at the Blackburn Correctional  
Complex in Lexington, will become the home for 65 to 70 retired 
thoroughbreds in association with the New Jersey-based Thoroughbred 
Retirement Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The horses will be cared for by inmates from the complex under  
an innovative training program created by the foundation and 
already under way in New York and Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the guidance of qualified farm managers, as many as 50  
minimum-security inmates will receive training in horse care and 
stable management. Eventually, the prisoners will maintain the 
facility and take care of the horses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We in Kentucky believe that all horses deserve no less than  
humane treatment and the right to a meaningful and productive life, 
even after their racing careers have crossed the finish line,'' 
Patton said during a ceremony at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation is a national volunteer organization which  
attempts to rescue, rehabilitate or provide homes for thoroughbred 
racehorses no longer able to compete. It already has retirement 
farms at the Wallkill (N.Y.) Correctional Facility and the Charles 
Hickey School for Boys in Maryland, and has broken ground on 120 
acres at the Marion County Correctional Facility in Ocala, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a terrible shame to see horses discarded,'' said Penny  
Chenery, owner of the late Triple Crown winner Secretariat. ``We 
certainly can't save them all. But at least we will be able to save 
60 or 70 more than we could before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blackburn, which also will raise 50 acres of alfalfa for its  
thoroughbred population, is a 394-bed minimum-security prison for 
men in northwestern Fayette County.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- ``Jell-O, Mr. Cosby!'' -- or hello, for those who  
don't understand Jell-O-ese. 
</P>
<P>
	Second graders at Walter L. Newberry Elementary School shouted  
the salutation Thursday as comedian Bill Cosby visited the Harold 
Washington Library downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosby's response was a simple, ``Hello, friend,'' a familiar  
greeting of his late son, Ennis, that he wore on his blue 
sweatshirt. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosby was on hand to celebrate his 25 years as a pitchman for  
Jell-O. The company that makes the jiggly dessert has donated more 
than 120,000 of his ``Little Bill'' beginner books to public 
libraries across the country, a venture supported by the nonprofit 
organization Reading is FUNdamental. 
</P>
<P>
	Dedicated to his son, who was shot in January 1997 while fixing  
a flat tire along a Los Angeles freeway, Cosby's eight books teach 
about such topics as honesty, friendship and creativity.

<HEADLINE> Dallas Mayor Seeks Second Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Four years after Ron Kirk became Dallas' first  
black mayor, he faces two lightly regarded challengers this weekend 
in his bid for a second term. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk faces immigration lawyer and political novice Margaret A.  
Donnelly and perennial candidate Billy Jack Ludwig in Saturday's 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	During his first term, Kirk pushed through referendums to build  
a sports arena and develop an area along the Trinity River near 
downtown. Each passed by fewer than 2,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk, a lawyer and former Texas secretary of state, said he is  
optimistic that voters ``aren't looking for a lot of change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is overwhelmingly positive feeling about the direction  
the city is going,'' he said. ``We've had two controversial 
referendums. People like that I tell them what I'm going to try to 
do and then go out and do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk said he will focus his second term on fixing streets,  
keeping the city safe and promoting economic development in south 
Dallas, the poorest part of town. Critics argue he has focused on 
grand projects that exist only in architectural drawings while 
ignoring crumbling roads and poor schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too many of our resources are being directed to economic  
development and not enough to education,'' Ms. Donnelly said. 
``Recreation centers in Dallas are closing between noon and 2 p.m. 
on Saturdays, just when they're most desperately needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ludwig accuses Kirk of being a tool of wealthy interests,  
including Tom Hicks and Ross Perot Jr., whose pro hockey and 
basketball teams will play in the new arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm running to get rid of the downtown group, the billionaires  
that control the mayor,'' Ludwig said, complaining that Hicks and 
Perot should be paying the city's $125 million share of the arena 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk expected to spend $500,000 on the campaign -- much more than  
his opponents but only half of what he spent in 1995. 
</P>

will decide whether to re-elect longtime Councilman Al Lipscomb, 
who has been indicted on bribery-related charges involving payments 
from a taxi-company owner. The 73-year-old Lipscomb goes on trial

	CARROLTON, Ark. (AP) -- Brandon Burlsworth, a second-team  
All-American guard who was recently drafted by the Indianapolis 
Colts, was killed Wednesday night when his car collided with a 
tractor-trailer rig. 
</P>
<P>
	Burlsworth, 22, a 6-foot-3, 318-pound offensive guard at  
Arkansas, was an All-Southeastern Conference selection who was

Harrison, Ark., when his car collided with a truck near Carrolton 
in northwestern Arkansas. He had been working out earlier in the 
day at the University of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas coach Houston Nutt called Burlsworth's death ``tragic

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom Tops Profit Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom Inc. earned $709 million in the  
first three months of 1999, topping Wall Street forecasts, as 
revenues from core communications services rose 17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-quarter net income, which amounted to 37 cents per  
share, included a gain of $67 million from the sale of shares in 
the Verio, an Internet service provider, and a $20 million loss 
from an investment in Brazil that was hurt by the currency crisis 
there. Without those one-time events, the company reported earnings 
of 36 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest results compare with a profit of $191 million, or 10  
cents a share, that WorldCom and MCI would have posted as a 
combined company in the first quarter of 1998, before they merged. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call expected Thursday's report by  
the nation's second biggest long-distance telephone company to show 
a per-share profit of 34 cents for the just-ended quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, MCI WorldCom closed down  
$3.68 3/4 per share at $84 amid a continuing bout of profit-taking 
among leading technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no mention in Thursday's earnings statement about the  
news reports earlier this month that MCI WorldCom is in talks to 
buy Nextel Communications, a leading wireless calling company 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive Bernard J. Ebbers, in a conference call after  
the quarterly results were published, actually made a point of 
mentioning the ``rumors in the paper,'' but declined to confirm or 
deny the reports. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he added, ``we will continue as a company over an  
extended period of time to evaluate strategic opportunities as they 
come along, and we will definitely look at opportunities that will 
make this company successful over the longer term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom is the only major telephone company without  
wireless operations -- a growing business that's expected to become 
as intertwined with the Internet as the rest of the communications 
industry. In January, the company backed out of a bidding war for 
AirTouch Communications, which agreed to be bought by Britain's 
Vodafone for $56 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-quarter report said revenues, excluding the  
fluctuating value of revenues from the investment in Embratel of 
Brazil, totaled $8.3 billion. That's an increase of nearly 15 
percent compared with the combined revenues of the same operations 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from core businesses -- which include long-distance and  
local calling, as well as data and Internet services -- accounted 
for $7.9 billion of the first-quarter tally. That compares with the 
$6.8 billion generated by the same operations a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Individually, calling revenues rose 7 percent to 5.1 billion,  
data revenues rose 31 percent to $1.7 billion, and Internet 
revenues rose 60 percent to $758 million. Overseas revenues rose 55 
percent to $357 million 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, based in Jackson, Miss., also reported strong  
growth in Internet usage time, with connection hours nearly 
doubling to 900 million hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an excellent start to the year and is indicative of  
how well the merger with MCI has progressed,'' said Ebbers, 
expressing confidence the company is on track to meet most Wall 
Street profit forecasts for all of 1999 and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no early reading on the company's foray into local  
calling service for residential consumers, launched in New York in 
early February.

<HEADLINE> Phils Brantley Put on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Phillies closer Jeff Brantley,  
put on the disabled list Wednesday night after being forced to 
leave a game because of shoulder trouble, could be lost for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillies team physician Dr. Phillip Marone on Thursday said  
Brantley has a tear in his right shoulder. The injury could be 
connected to trouble that caused him to miss four months in 1997 
and part of the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had no problems until two weeks ago,'' Marone said. ``It's  
not totally unrelated to the old tear, but this one is a new one, 
only more extensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brantley, 35, will get a second opinion on Monday from Dr. James  
Andrews in Birmingham, Ala. Andrews operated on him in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	If surgery is needed, Brantley will miss at least four months  
and possibly the whole year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just real disheartening to work as hard as I have and  
throw as well as I was throwing and then have this happen,'' said 
Brantley, in his first season with the Phillies after an offseason 
trade with the St. Louis Cardinals. ``I'm in a new place where I 
know they need me. I feel like I'm letting them down.''

	Brantley is 1-1 and four saves with a 2.84 ERA in seven games.  
He was sidelined for 11 days earlier this season, and returned to 
get a save Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, Brantley took to start the ninth with the  
Phillies and Reds tied at 8. He walked one batter, struck out 
another, then left and was the losing pitcher in a 12-8 defeat.

	Philadelphia general manager Ed Wade had no immediate plans to  
replace Brantley as closer. Steve Montgomery was called up from 
Triple-A Scranton-Wilkes-Barre to take Brantley's roster spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, I'm real disappointed for him,'' Wade said. ``But, it's  
hard to go out and buy a closer. We're going to have to rely on 
guys to step into roles they're not accustomed to.''

	Panel OKs Anti-Flag-Burn Amendment  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate panel today approved a proposed  
constitutional amendment that would allow Congress to ban flag 
burning. The proposal is given a good change of becoming law. By 
11-7, the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended Senate approval of 
the 17-word amendment that attained far more than the two-thirds 
majority required in the House in 1997. Approval by two-thirds in 
both the House and Senate and ratification by three-fourths of the 
states would add the provision to the Constitution.

dead and an anonymous telephone caller threatened to kill her boss. 
Jill Dando was shot in the head Monday on the doorstep of her 
London home. The British news agency Press Association reported 
that the caller claimed to be a Serb and said Tony Hall, the BBC's 
chief executive of news, would be the next victim in retaliation 
for the NATO bomb attacks on Serbian TV. Others speculate Dando's 
death was a botched robbery, or her killer a stalker.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government has approved the first at-home  
test for hepatitis C, coinciding with a massive public health 
campaign against the dangerous liver virus. An estimated 3.9 
million Americans have hepatitis C, but many do not know that the 
virus silently lurks in their bodies. Because there are now a few 
drugs to treat hepatitis C, doctors have launched campaigns for all 
at-risk people to be tested. The Food and Drug Administration 
approved Home Access Health Inc.'s Hepatitis C Check last night, 
offering the choice of an anonymous test instead of going to a 
clinic.

<HEADLINE> Tennis Prize Money Differs by Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Wimbledon could be on a collision  
course with women's tennis after refusing again to give equal prize 
money to men and women. 
</P>
<P>
	What might anger the women even more is the All England Club's  
reasons for refusing the WTA's demands. 
</P>
<P>
	Announcing a 5.4 percent increase in prize money to $12.16  
million, club chairman John Curry explained Thursday why the men's 
winner will receive $728,000 and the winning woman only $655,200. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do surveys of all the people who come on a regular basis  
and, in three surveys over the past 10 years, 70 percent of the 
people say that first and foremost the thing they want to watch is 
men's singles,'' Curry said. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The women) have every right to request, but to demand it I  
think is hurtful and damaging to Wimbledon. It implies that we 
treat them unfairly and that's not true from the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the players enjoy playing Wimbledon and the prize  
money is only a small portion of their income.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WTA said the women received only 83 percent of the figure  
Wimbledon offers to the men and that was far below any of the other 
Grand Slam tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	At the U.S. Open, women receive equal prize money with the men.  
At the Australian Open, they get 94 percent, and at the French 
Open, it's 90 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Under pressure to cut the disparity, Wimbledon has increased the  
women's doubles prize money by 10.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wimbledon's recognition of the increased strength of women's  
doubles is heartening,'' said Bart McGuire, chief executive officer 
of the WTA Tour. ``But its refusal to give the women a higher 
percentage of the singles prize money is extremely disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam that has failed to provide  
equal prize money or to increase the prize money in women's singles 
relative to the men in recognition of the increased strength of the 
women's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Tour and its players expected more and merit more.''  
</P>
<P>
	Curry said the club remained adamant that there should be no  
equality in singles prize money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had representations from the WTA who say they deserve  
equal prize money in all Grand Slam events,'' Curry said. ``There 
is supposed to be a petition signed by 90 players which we've heard 
about but haven't seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm right in saying that they get less than 50 percent  
of the men's ATP tournaments and in combined events it is around 60 
percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that, because the women's titles are spread among  
fewer players compared with the men, the best women wind up getting 
more money, especially because they also dominate doubles events. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who walk away with the largest checks are the  
ladies,'' he said. ``Jana Novotna earned more than Pete Sampras 
last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras earned $696,000 for winning the men's singles, and  
Novotna, who teamed with Martina Hingis to win the women's doubles 
along with the singles title, won $749,728.

<HEADLINE> NHL Playoff Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The New Jersey Devils are a team still trying to find its rhythm  
in the Stanley Cup playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	So defenseman Scott Stevens hopes they take a page from Tuesday  
night's 4-2 victory at Pittsburgh when they face the Penguins in 
Game 5 of their Eastern Conference series tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to finish our checks, but the bottom line is we want  
to play our game like the other night,'' said Stevens, whose team 
is tied 2-2 in the best-of-7 series, which resumes at the 
Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to play the same way we did the last game. We have to  
play a convincing game, in people's faces, and make it 
uncomfortable for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top-ranked Devils won the opener 3-1, then lost the next  
two, 4-1 and 4-2, before their Game 4 win. 
</P>
<P>
	In other games tonight, it will be Philadelphia at Toronto, St.  
Louis at Phoenix, Boston at Carolina and San Jose at Colorado. The 
Philadelphia-Toronto and Boston-Carolina series are each tied 2-2, 
while Phoenix leads St. Louis 3-1 and Colorado leads San Jose 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no games Thursday night.  
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins have played three straight games without  
league-leading scorer Jaromir Jagr, sidelined with a groin injury. 
They were 2-1 without him. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr said Wednesday he would play in Game 5, but there was some  
doubt following workouts on Thursday, when the star forward left 
practice early and didn't talk to the media. A decision on his 
availability was expected after this morning's skate or shortly 
before gametime. 
</P>
<P>
	With or without Jagr, Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur thinks  
the Penguins will be tough. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not going to give us anything,'' he said. ``Sometimes  
when you come in as the first seed and you play the eighth seed, 
you feel you are going to get the chance to win. But these guys 
won't beat themselves. We are going to have to beat them and that's 
what's surprising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers have also been somewhat of a surprise against the  
Maple Leafs. Like the Penguins, they're missing a superstar 
forward, Eric Lindros, who is recuperating from a collapsed lung. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers tied the series with an impressive 5-2 victory on  
Wednesday. Philadelphia has outshot Toronto 134-71 in the first 
four games, even more surprising because the Maple Leafs were the 
top scoring team in the NHL this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their forechecking has produced most of their scoring  
opportunities,'' Maple Leafs coach Pat Quinn said. ``That's where 
they've been good all season, and for years, and we haven't been 
able to nullify it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins-Hurricanes series returns to Carolina following  
Boston's 4-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are at most three games left in this series, so there's  
not a lot of time to wait now,'' Carolina coach Paul Maurice said. 
``I'm happy we've been able to push this thing as far back as we 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks showed the Avalanche they weren't going to go quietly  
with a 4-2 victory Wednesday night in Game 3 after losing the first 
two at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've still got the upper hand,'' San Jose defenseman Bill  
Houlder said. ``We've got some momentum, but momentum is only going 
to last so long -- like the first three or four minutes of the next 
game, if that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Momentum is also the word in the Blues-Coyotes series. The  
Coyotes' 2-1 victory Tuesday night was their third straight after 
they lost the opener. Many of the Phoenix players think Game 4 was 
their best of the series, resulting in a quiet confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as we were happy about winning two games in St. Louis,  
I'd say 15 minutes after Tuesday's game everybody was 
businesslike,'' Rick Tocchet said. ``On the bus, there was no music 
playing, no partying going on. Guys were back to earth. It was just 
a quiet atmosphere. As a veteran player, I love seeing that.''

<HEADLINE> Worm May Cause Frog Deformity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For 20 years, scientists have been puzzled and  
alarmed about the deformities and population declines among some 
frogs. Now, researchers say one of the reasons is a parasitic worm 
as small as the period at the end of this sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Two studies today in the journal Science report that laboratory  
research shows a trematode, a simple parasitic flatworm, is 
infecting tadpoles that grow into frogs with deformed, missing or 
multiple hind legs. 
</P>
<P>
	The worm infection, says Stanley K. Sessions of Hartwick College  
in Oneonta, N.Y., causes the tadpoles to develop cysts where their 
hind legs grow, resulting in severe malformation that dooms the 
animal after it becomes a frog. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every single frog I have looked at with extra legs, and I have  
looked at hundreds, all have these cysts around the deformity,'' 
said Sessions, who co-authored one of the Science studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Pieter T.J. Johnson, a recent graduate of Stanford University  
now doing research at Claremont McKenna College, carried Sessions' 
early work one step further by collecting trematodes from snails in 
four ponds where deformed frogs were found. Laboratory tadpoles 
were then infected with the worms. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson found that the more trematode infections the tadpoles  
acquired, the more the legs of the adult frog were deformed, 
multiplied or missing. And he also showed that the deformities 
developed in the laboratory experiments were the same as those seen 
in the four ponds in northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Blaustein, an Oregon State University ecologist who  
conducted experiments to determine if ultraviolet radiation was 
causing the widespread problem, called Johnson's work ``the best 
experimental evidence showing a cause for the limb deformation in 
amphibians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers worldwide have noted for years that many species of  
frogs are in decline, particularly in the northern and western 
United States, Central America and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have suspected pesticides, chemical pollution and  
excess UV radiation caused by a thinning of the atmosphere's ozone 
layer. A great deal of research has been devoted to the issue 
because the sudden demise of frogs was considered a possible 
warning about an unknown environmental problem. 
</P>
<P>
	But the studies by Johnson and Sessions show that at least some  
of the frog problems are caused by Mother Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the increased deformities caused by the parasite  
could be part of a natural biological cycle. However, he said it is 
too early to hold humans blameless, saying that fertilizer runoff 
may have caused an increase in water snails that are key hosts of 
the parasite. 
</P>
<P>
	The trematode has a life cycle that includes snails, tadpoles  
and frogs, and birds. A just-hatched form of the parasite is 
consumed or absorbed by a snail. The worm develops into a larvae 
that is deposited in a pond. The worm swims until it hooks onto a 
tadpole and then forms cysts in the leg buds of the developing 
amphibian. When the frog matures, its hind legs are either missing, 
multiplied or deformed. This makes the frog an easy prey for birds, 
which become the next host of the parasite. 
</P>
<P>
	Digestive juices of the bird release trematodes from their cysts  
in the frog and the worms reproduce. Trematode eggs in the bird 
feces are then deposited in a pond and the cycle starts anew. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said even though trematodes are found throughout North  
America, the parasite probably is not the single cause for a 
worldwide decline in frogs and other amphibians first noticed two 
decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is far too early to say that this is the final answer for  
the amphibian decline,'' he said. ``Something different may also be 
going on.''

<HEADLINE> Russain Minister Criticizes IMF Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A day after the International Monetary  
Fund reached agreement with Russia on an economic reform program, 
Russia's economic minister accused the international community of 
failing to respond quickly to his country's financial crisis -- 
astounding IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrei G. Shapovaliants made no mention of Wednesday's agreement  
in principle on an economic plan and $4.5 billion in new IMF loans 
to Moscow, complaining instead that Russia had suffered badly 
because of the lending institution's inaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia appears to have been a target of discrimination since  
it was the only country as far as we know among the crisis-hit 
countries that didn't receive timely international support,'' he 
said Thursday at a joint meeting of the U.N. Economic and Social 
Council and top officials of the IMF and World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian economic upheaval which spread to Russia and Brazil  
revealed ``the lack of an effectively functioning early warning and 
prevention system for financial crises,'' the Russian minister 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said afterward that he listened to the criticism  
``with a sense of -- I don't know -- unreality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was surprised that the minister didn't mention  
Wednesday's package to help Russia fight the consequences of the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must tell him with a little bit less humor that I was  
surprised (to hear) that we have not been able to warn and to 
prevent this crisis,'' Camdessus told the meeting, attended by 
ministers and high-level representatives from more than 30 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalled personally traveling to Russia ``to warn the  
authorities about the risk mounting for them,'' and putting 
together a major package last spring to cope with the risk. But he 
said it wasn't supported by the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF came under extensive criticism last summer when it  
announced a major rescue effort for Russia only to see the program 
derailed within weeks after Russian authorities gave up an 
ineffective effort to defend the value of the ruble. The Russian 
default in August 1998 triggered the darkest days in the 
20-month-old global economic crisis that began in Thailand in July 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said his staff had been telling him to be prudent in  
saying the crisis was over. 
</P>
<P>
	But he told the meeting that the countries worst affected ``are  
now in the recovery process or close to it.''

<HEADLINE> Panel Wants Hedge Fund Disclosure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to the near-collapse of a big  
high-risk investment fund, a presidential task force is 
recommending that such hedge funds be required by law to disclose 
financial information now deemed private, according to a House 
source. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-awaited recommendations are in response to the  
near-demise last fall of Long-Term Capital Management, which sent 
shock waves through world financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	They were being made public today by the President's Working  
Group on Financial Markets, which was established after the October 
1987 stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is made up of officials from the Federal Reserve, the  
Treasury Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It has been trying to unravel 
for months the events leading to the meltdown of Connecticut-based 
Long-Term Capital, a big speculative fund for wealthy investors. 
</P>
<P>
	While hedge funds are largely unregulated, the Fed and the  
Treasury do have responsibility for the nation's banking system, 
which could be severely affected by a major hedge fund collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also is recommending that Congress give the SEC and  
the CFTC more authority to collect data on unregulated affiliates 
of securities firms that participate in hedge funds, the House 
official said Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Another recommendation is that the SEC begin requiring publicly  
traded companies, such as big banks and brokerage firms, to 
disclose any significant investments they have in hedge funds. 
</P>
<P>
	And the panel recommends that regulators require banks and  
brokerage firms to set aside more reserves to cover potential 
losses from hedge fund investments, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hedge funds would be required to disclose their financial  
data to federal regulators every three months under the white House 
panel's proposal. Currently some but not all hedge funds are 
required to file financial reports with the CFTC, but the reports 
are often out of date and kept confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	The working group, however, is not calling for direct government  
regulation of hedge funds, according to the source. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and SEC Chairman Arthur  
Levitt both have said publicly in recent months they believe that 
new government controls on hedge funds aren't needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan acknowledged recently that the Long-Term Capital  
debacle was a failure of the current system, which relies on banks 
-- rather than federal regulators -- to supervise the hedge funds to 
which they lend money. But he called it ``a single mistake ... a 
very rare event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long-Term Capital's near-collapse last September after its  
managers bet wrong on interest-rate swings threatened financial 
markets. The Federal Reserve stepped in and helped arrange a $3.6 
billion bailout by a group of major banks and brokerage firms. 
</P>
<P>
	The investors in -- and rescuers of -- Long-Term Capital included  
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter, Travelers Group, UBS Securities Inc. and several big 
European banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Parkinson, associate director of the Fed's research and  
statistics division, told lawmakers last December that banks making 
generous loans to Long-Term Capital ``didn't ask enough questions'' 
about the fund's risks and operations.

<HEADLINE> Hand Transplant Patient Heads Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Matthew Scott figures his new hand will  
someday be featured in medical school textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
	That's fine with him, so long as his name is left out of it.  
</P>
<P>
	Scott, who made headlines and medical history when he underwent  
the nation's first successful hand transplant Jan. 25, completed 
treatment in Louisville this week. On Wednesday, he and his wife, 
Dawn, left for home in Abescon, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	But first he took time for a news conference -- one he hoped  
would be his last. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a dream if I could be anonymous,'' the 38-year-old  
paramedic told reporters. ``I would very much like to fade into the 
background.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he still has no sensation in his fingertips, hand  
surgeon Warren Breidenbach said Scott was progressing rapidly. He 
said full sensation should come in about a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, who lost his hand 13 years ago in a firecracker accident,  
said it is too early to tell how his quality of life will be 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still in uncharted waters,'' said Jon Jones, one of  
Scott's doctors. Scott already overcame one episode of rejection, 
Jones said, though the possibility still exists for another. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we're confident we can handle what comes next,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Scott was quick to point out that he can now throw a baseball  
``35 feet down the center of the plate.'' Among his goals in 
seeking the transplant was a chance to play catch with his son. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics had doubted such a procedure could work and argued that  
the risk involved was not worth the reward. Scott countered 
Wednesday by saying, ``my precious gift is anything but useless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott said he expects to return to his teaching job at a  
community college and as an emergency medical service supervisor in 
about two weeks. He said there likely will be changes in adjusting 
to life away from public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott also talked about the anti-rejection medications he has  
come to depend on, which carry their own risks of complications. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``the time to be scared has come and gone ...  
Once we decided to go ahead, the fear more or less left.''

<HEADLINE>  PLO Delays Statehood Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Defusing a potentially explosive  
issue, the Palestinian leadership voted overwhelmingly today to 
delay a decision on statehood until after Israel's May 17 election. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came on the third day of debate by the PLO's Central  
Council on whether to declare statehood May 4 -- the date the 
Palestinians say marks the end of the five-year autonomy period -- 
or extend peace talks with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision not to decide for now gives Palestinian leader  
Yasser Arafat new room to maneuver at a critical time when Israeli 
voters are closely watching his every move. 
</P>
<P>
	It also robs Israel's hard-line prime minister, Benjamin  
Netanyahu, of fodder for his campaign. Netanyahu, who says he is 
the only candidate able to stand up to Palestinian demands, made 
Arafat's initial pledge to declare statehood May 4 a key campaign 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided to give ourselves an open-ended session because we  
don't want to let any decision serve Netanyahu and the Israeli 
groups that are fighting peace,'' said Abdallah Frangi, the PLO's 
representative in Germany and a PCC member. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision approved today declares the current session of the  
Central Council open-ended and convenes another general meeting of 
all 124 members in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel's election is slated for May 17, with a possible runoff  
set for June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat spent hours Wednesday night reviewing the wording of the  
PCC decision with eight council delegates drafting the resolution, 
said Ziad Abu Amr, a legislator and member of the drafting 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinian leader told the panel a delay was wise because  
he did not want to influence the Israeli election and disappoint 
the dozens of world leaders who had urged him to hold off on a 
statehood declaration, Abu Amr told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat also said Palestinians should refrain from actions that  
might backfire. They can always declare a state at a later time, 
preferably with the full support of the international community, 
Arafat argued, according to Abu Amr. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said the Palestinians  
retained all their options. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision does not cancel a declaration of statehood. It's  
only a specified postponement and the possibility of declaring a 
state stands,'' Shaath said. 
</P>
<P>
	The council also said it would take steps toward state-building,  
such as forming a committee that will start work on writing a draft 
constitution. The committee is to be headed by Ismat Abdel Maguid, 
the secretary general of the Arab League. 
</P>
<P>
	The council also authorized a smaller group, the 18-member PLO  
Executive Committee, to review letters of assurances Arafat has 
received from the European Union and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat had traversed the globe in recent weeks to drum up  
support for Palestinian independence. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for agreeing to delay a declaration of statehood,  
Arafat won EU backing for a Palestinian state within a year and the 
strongest expression of support yet for Palestinian 
self-determination from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration also said it wanted negotiations for  
a final peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians completed 
within a year, instead of open-ended negotiations as Israel wants. 
</P>
<P>
	With a delay emerging as the likely PCC decision in recent days,  
Netanyahu has repeatedly claimed credit, saying his hard-line 
policies, including the threat to annex parts of the West Bank, 
forced Arafat to back down from a unilateral statehood declaration. 
</P>
<P>
	A unilateral statehood declaration, followed by Israeli  
annexation, would likely have led to widespread bloodshed. ``We 
saved the peace process,'' Netanyahu said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a TV campaign ad Wednesday night, Netanyahu told viewers that  
he had scored a major diplomatic victory.

<HEADLINE> Man's Legs Severed in NYC Subway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A man's legs were severed after he was shoved in  
front of a subway train by a homeless man during the evening rush 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Edgar Rivera, a 46-year-old father of three, was standing on the  
platform at 51st Street and Lexington Avenue when Julio Perez, 43, 
pushed him onto the tracks, seconds before the train entered the 
station Wednesday night, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons were unable to reattach Rivera's legs.  
</P>
<P>
	A Manhattan judge ordered a psychiatric examination for Perez,  
who is charged with attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer David Kapner said Perez told him he had been  
treated at two hospitals for mental illness in the past year and is 
now a psychiatric outpatient at a veterans' hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Perez had been acting strangely just before the  
attack, and allegedly punched a wall after a passenger asked him to 
move away. Within seconds, they said, Perez pushed Rivera into the 
train's path. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera screamed, ``Oh my God!'' and tumbled into the path of the  
train, witnesses said. As he scrambled to lift himself to safety, 
two cars of the train passed over his legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers held Perez until police arrived.

<HEADLINE> TV Showcases Different Moms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Before you pick out a Mother's Day card, take  
a look at the matriarchs in PBS' ``Moms'' and Lifetime's 
``Different Moms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two films offer more than a warm, milk-and-cookies look at  
motherhood, and it's likely you'll come away with a renewed 
appreciation for what mom has done for you -- or, in some instances, 
to you. 
</P>
<P>
	First up is ``Moms,'' on PBS stations 10 p.m. EDT Sunday, May 2  
(check local listings); it's a sometimes lighthearted, sometimes 
poignant appraisal by women of the experience of mothering and 
being mothered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Different Moms,'' on cable's Lifetime channel at 11 p.m. EDT  
Monday, May 10, is a clear-eyed examination of how mentally 
disabled parents handle the difficulties of raising children who 
are not handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the former documentary is far more universal,  
``Different Moms'' also raises broader questions about what forms 
the soul of parenthood for every person, not just the mentally 
impaired. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moms,'' from producers Louis Alvarez and Andrew Kolker and  
WETA in Washington, D.C., is an outright charmer, a kaleidoscope of 
motherhood made bright by the women sharing their memories, 
theories and homespun humor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Motherhood is a job, and after 25 years you don't even get the  
watch,'' says one mom. 
</P>
<P>
	'' 'I'll rip your lungs out,' that's my favorite saying,'' says  
another, an elderly woman looking back -- half-embarrassed, 
half-amused -- on her disciplinary style. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you are raising children, you have to force yourself to  
grow up. I guess that's what it boils down to,'' says another. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the women are so engaging and wise that you wish they  
could lead national master classes in parenting. Others clearly are 
hanging on by their fingernails. 
</P>
<P>
	One crisply groomed woman, trying to run her big household with  
military precision, is undercut at every turn by typical kid 
rambunctiousness. Another recalls smacking her boy's legs with a 
baseball bat; her lifelong guilt feelings are clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lament the idea that their chick must one day fly away;  
others count the days. ``I'm just waiting to boot them out,'' one 
mother says, an anticipatory grin lighting up her face. 
</P>
<P>
	Motherhood is nothing to joke about in ``Different Moms,'' part  
of Lifetime's effort to illuminate issues surrounding mental 
retardation (the accepted medical term, the film notes). Liz Garbus 
and Rory Kennedy are the executive producers; actress Alfre Woodard 
narrates. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentally impaired mothers bear about 120,000 babies each year,  
and about half get to keep them, according to the documentary. 
``Different Moms'' focuses on three such families, each with 
offspring of normal intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim and Elaine Mayfield of Upper Darby, Pa., have a 4-year-old  
son and a 5-year-old daughter who is just beginning to outpace her 
moderately impaired mom in learning skills. Tim is mildly 
handicapped but clearly more adept at handling the parent's role. 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Main, a single mother with an IQ of 41, is rearing two  
teen-age sons in a mobile home, on property in upstate New York 
owned by her sister. Juanita Ingraham of Santa Maria, Calif., has 
two grown daughters she struggled to bring up largely on her own. 
</P>
<P>
	By tracking families in varying stages of child-rearing, the  
film gives a full picture of how a mentally impaired parent deals 
with a child's changing needs -- and, in the case of the older kids, 
how they coped with having parents who are different. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to hide my mom like she wasn't my mom,'' says Violet,  
one of Juanita Ingraham's daughters. ``Now I can say, 'That's my 
mom' ... because there's nothing to be embarrassed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Life for these children is tough on many counts. Disciplinary  
skills and even simple jobs like providing nutritious meals may be 
difficult for their parents to master, and it's clear the children 
take on part of the burden. 
</P>
<P>
	Some rise to the challenge with extraordinary grace: Margaret  
Main's 15-year-old son, Floyd, is a bright and loving youngster who 
would be considered a gem by any parent. 
</P>
<P>
	What helps the families function best is outside help, whether  
from relatives or from agencies that can pinpoint and bolster their 
weaknesses. There are only 40 such organizations nationwide, 
filmmaker Garbus said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without those supports, a family which could really make it  
might not. Ultimately, I believe we have a collective 
responsibility for our weakest members. As a society, I believe 
it's our responsibility to provide that support,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	There's another key to a family's success: A parent's love for  
the children and a fierce desire to do right by them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important part of parenting is something that is not  
measured by IQ, and that is the nurturing and loving ability to be 
there for one's child,'' Garbus said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Panel OKs Anti-Flag-Burn Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A constitutional amendment to ban flag burning  
moved a step closer to a Senate vote today in a political 
atmosphere that could provide its best chance of passage in years. 
</P>
<P>
	Changes in the make-up of the Senate -- including replacement of  
one amendment opponent by a co-sponsor -- the conflict in Kosovo and 
even the Colorado shootings have combined this year to make things 
look smoother in a chamber where the measure has failed in previous 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Passage by both houses -- votes that would require two-thirds  
majorities -- would send the amendment to the states, where 
ratification by 38 states would be needed for it to become part of 
the Constitution. Forty-nine states have given indications that 
they would ratify it. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has easily attained the two-thirds majority in the  
past. But the last time the Senate considered the matter, the 
proposed amendment fell three votes short. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are experiencing a value malaise in this country, and the  
negative impact falls hardest on our children,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, 
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Thursday after the 
panel's 11-7 approval of the measure. ``Without a strong value 
system, our children cannot distinguish good from bad or right from 
wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate GOP leaders expect a floor vote by Memorial Day,  
according to John Czwartacki, spokesman for Majority Leader Trent 
Lott. The House Judiciary Committee has yet to consider a similar 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the 17-word amendment said it overreacts to a rare  
occurrence -- physical flag desecration -- and threatens free speech 
rights. Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., said those protesting the 
government by burning a flag are daring Congress to crack down on 
guaranteed rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's show our strength by not rising to the bait, by not  
giving them what they want,'' Feingold told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal reads: ``The Congress shall have power to prohibit  
the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.'' 
Congress has proposed more than 10,000 amendments since the 
Constitution went into effect in 1789. Only 27 have been ratified. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the factors boosting support in the Senate is the election  
last fall of former Ohio Gov. George Voinovich, a co-sponsor of the 
amendment, to the seat vacated by Sen. John Glenn, a Democrat and 
an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	There are signs that some votes might be shifting, as well.  
North Dakota Democratic Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad, who 
both voted against the amendment last time, are undecided now, 
their spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate crosses party lines. Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., for  
example, chided supporters of the measure by telling the Judiciary 
Committee, ``We cannot mandate respect and pride in the flag.'' He 
said the amendment is an overreaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told the committee  
that she supports the amendment because the flag ``is a monument in 
fabric that hangs as a symbol of our nation'' and its values.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reservists Prepare for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KOKOMO, Ind. (AP) -- Last year, the family vacationed at Hilton  
Head and Disney World. This spring, they visited Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	But this summer, there will not be a family getaway: The father  
expects to be flying refueling missions over Kosovo as one of 
33,102 reservists called up by President Clinton to serve in the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we're trained for this and are prepared to show our  
best side, we'd just as soon stay home,'' the lieutenant colonel 
said Wednesday at Grissom Air Reserve Base, north of Kokomo. 
</P>
<P>
	Reservists from Indiana and 11 other states are preparing for  
another mission away from their families and another round of 
missed birthdays, holidays and graduations. When duty calls, these 
families, and not just their soldiers, must cope with the 
disruption and anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always stressful, but you deal with it,'' said a  
navigator with the 434th Air Refueling Wing at Grissom. ``We try 
not to concentrate on all that stuff. ... I'll have enough time to 
think about that while I'm out here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even a boom operator who said she looked forward to the mission  
knew that it carried special burdens for her relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though I'll miss my family and birthdays and maybe even  
Mother's Day, I'll try to make it all up to them,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grissom is home to one of the Air Force's largest air refueling  
units, with 22 KC-135 Stratotankers. This is the second call-up in 
the last three years; in 1995-96, hundreds of members of the 434th 
served during a NATO peacekeeping mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
	The base requested that the names of its reservists not be used  
in order to avoid identifying families who may be left alone for 
the next several months. Burglars might take advantage, base 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deployment has already caused headaches for the lieutenant  
colonel. His wife was supposed to take a trip this weekend to 
Chicago with several friends -- with no kids and no husbands. 
Instead, he said, the weekend will be spent at home, worrying. 
</P>
<P>
	Once he's called to active duty, he said his wife will shut  
herself in the house for most of the time he's gone, refusing to 
travel with the kids in his absence. 
</P>
<P>
	He expects the doldrums to be even worse for his family during  
this assignment. Although he served in Desert Storm and did a stint 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, this is the first time he'll be flying into 
an air war. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time is a little different,'' he said. ``I've done the  
best I could to let them know I'm well-trained and that's our best 
defense to get home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Maj. Kevin Ketterman, flying an air tanker bulging with some  
25,000 gallons of fuel just 20 feet above another airplane is 
practiced precision. 
</P>
<P>
	It's his job to hold the tanker in position while flying at 600  
mph as a pipe and nozzle about the diameter of a coffee cup drains 
fuel into a bomber or fighter jet flying just below. 
</P>
<P>
	None of his composure made it any easier for the TWA pilot and  
Pennsylvania Air National Guardsman to tell his three children that 
he has to go away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time that we sit down and I explain what's going to  
happen,'' he said. ``They understand that this is not a routine 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ketterman, 40, a member of the 171st Air Refueling Wing at  
Pittsburgh International Airport, said he was planning to tell his 
three children over dinner what was happening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leaving my kids is the hardest part,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Once they get notification, members of the 931st Air Refueling  
Group in Wichita, Kan., have just 24 hours to arrange their family 
affairs, leave their civilian jobs and report to McConnell Air 
Force Base for duty. 
</P>
<P>
	The whirlwind can be so traumatic that Col. Dean J. Despinoy,  
the unit's commander, has activated a special team to help families 
left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real dedication ... for the rest of the folks that will be  
staying back here at the unit is to make sure that they are doing 
everything they can to support those families,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Authorities investigating the Columbine  
High School massacre once again found themselves backing away from 
public comments about the case today. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview broadcast this morning on NBC's ``Today'' show,  
District Attorney David Thomas said an arrest in the case would be 
made within a day or two. He said authorities were discussing the 
man's surrender with his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, however, Pam Russell, a spokeswoman for  
Thomas, said more information gathered by police had changed the 
timeline on an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because this is a quickly developing and very fluid  
investigation, the way the investigation went through the night, it 
does not look like there will be an arrest in the next 48 hours,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest publicity misstep in the investigation into  
one of the nation's bloodiest school massacres. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday, Sheriff  
John Stone said he believed three camouflage-clad youths who knew 
the gunmen and were wandering outside during the attack may have 
played some role. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, investigators rousted Stone from bed to explain his  
comments. The Jefferson County sheriff held a late news conference 
and said he was ``highly suspicious'' of the three. He added, 
though, that he didn't intend to give the impression that the 
investigation was focusing on them. 
</P>
<P>
	His spokesman said the sheriff hadn't been updated on the latest  
information in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately the sheriff can't know every single little  
detail in a case this huge,'' spokesman Jim Parr said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone had told the AP that he was suspicious of the three  
because they had claimed to have heard of the killings on the radio 
-- and were able to name the gunmen -- before the names had been 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman didn't address that issue, but merely said the  
three had been cleared after being questioned twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone and other investigators have felt the crush of a probe  
involving hundreds of sheriff's officials, dozens of state, federal 
and local agencies and a complex case in which much of the evidence 
hasn't even been reviewed. Stone's department is the lead agency in 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial reports that 25 were killed were eventually revised to  
15. Investigators first said three gunmen were in the school, then 
changed that to two. Investigators said a girlfriend of one of the 
gunmen bought a handgun and a rifle used in the crime -- and then on 
Wednesday said she actually bought two shotguns and a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
	A sleepy Stone answered dozens of sometimes hostile questions  
from reporters during his nationally televised news conference 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I should just let my professionals handle it and get  
back to my job as county sheriff,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Regulators Ax Coke's Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's antitrust agency on Thursday ruled  
against Coca-Cola Co.'s plans to market soft drink brands of 
Cadbury Schweppes PLC in the country, a Coca-Cola executive said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't received a formal notification, but we know that  
the agency has ruled against the purchase of the Cadbury Schweppes 
brands in Mexico,'' said Rodrigo Calderon, vice president of 
corporate relations at Coca-Cola Export Corp. in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola announced in December a $1.85 billion deal that gives  
it rights in 120 countries outside the United States to sell 
Cadbury Schweppes soft-drink brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico is one of Coca-Cola's largest markets and has been one of  
Coke's growth leaders, with sales up 13 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Manuel Sandoval, spokesman of Mexico's Federal Competition  
Commission, or CFC, said the agency's commissioners have ruled on 
the issue. The decision will be announced Friday. He declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Calderon said Coca-Cola can request a review.  
</P>
<P>
	In Mexico, Cadbury Schweppes markets brands such as Penafiel  
mineral water, Canada Dry ginger ale, Orange Crush and 
apple-flavored soft-drinks Extra Poma and Balseca. 
</P>
<P>
	Calderon said Coca-Cola holds a 67 percent share of Mexico's  
soft drink market. If the CFC awards rights to market Cadbury 
Schweppes brands in the country, Coca-Cola's market share would 
rise to about 71 percent, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling is one of several setbacks to Coca-Cola in recent  
weeks. Similar antitrust decisions were taken in other markets, 
such as Australia and Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Walker: Three Homers, Eight RBIs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Of all things, Larry Walker began his  
three-homer, eight-RBI game squaring around to bunt. 
</P>
<P>
	After Darryl Hamilton and Mike Lansing singled to start  
Wednesday night's game against the St. Louis Cardinals' Jose 
Jimenez, Walker's first instinct was far from heroic. He just 
wanted to help a struggling team that had lost four straight on the 
road any way he could. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to get a couple guys over,'' Walker said. ``There  
was nobody out, and I would have been content with getting a bunt 
down and getting the runners over for Dante (Bichette).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker fouled off the bunt attempt on the first pitch, and the  
Rockies are glad he did. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been a plus,'' Walker said joking, ``but I'll  
take the result that came.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's NL batting champion hit his first homer off a 1-2  
Jimenez curveball. He hit another three-run shot off Jimenez in the 
second, and after singling in the fifth, he smacked a two-run shot 
off Scott Radinsky in the seventh. He insists he wasn't swinging 
for the fences, at least until the ninth when he had a chance to 
tie the major-league record, but grounded out to second against 
Mike Busby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to drive the ball the last time and probably got  
overanxious, and swung at a pitch that wasn't in the zone, and 
wasn't the one I was looking for,'' Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he didn't seem disappointed with his work, which tied the  
Rockies' single-game RBI record set by Andres Galarraga on June 27, 
1996, against the Los Angeles Dodgers, hiked his batting average 73 
points to .308 and boosted his RBI total to 13. As a bonus, the 
four-time Gold Glove winner made two good catches in right field. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did it to us by himself,'' said Cardinals reliever Mike  
Mohler, who gave up a single to Walker. ``Eight RBIs, that doesn't 
happen often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker was the first visiting player to hit three homers at  
Busch Stadium since Larry Parrish of Montreal on May 29, 1977. Mark 
McGwire was the last Cardinals player to do it, during his record 
70-homer season on April 14, 1998, against Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker hit 49 homers in 1997. His only other three-homer game  
came that year, April 5 at Montreal. Last year he hit only 23, but 
that was because an elbow injury robbed him of most of his power. 
Nothing hurts now. 
</P>
<P>
	``About the only thing that bothers me in the cold weather is my  
knee, which I had surgery on in 1988,'' Walker said. ``Other than 
that, everything is fine right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker missed the first seven games with a strained rib-cage  
muscle he injured late in spring training, and wasn't his old self 
the first few games back. His run-scoring double and sacrifice fly 
Tuesday night was his first multi-RBI game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been struggling since I came off the disabled list, and I  
know it's going to take some time until I get my timing back,'' 
Walker said. ``The last three games I've felt decent. Tonight was a 
good sign.''

<HEADLINE> Muslim Women Settle Dress Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seven Muslim women who say they were fired for  
refusing to remove religious head scarves while working security 
jobs at Dulles International Airport learned Wednesday they could 
return to work. 
</P>
<P>
	The concession was part of a settlement reached with Argenbright  
Security Inc. in an effort to avoid an Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	``This settlement will finally educate those employers who still  
want to discriminate that they can't do that,'' said attorney 
Martin McMahon, who represented the women involved in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``My manager said, 'If you are not going to take the scarf off  
go home,''' said Rueain Mohamed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were never terminated,'' said David Gamsey, Argenbright's  
chief financial officer, noting that the company made repeated 
requests for the women to return to work. ``We're very pleased that 
this misunderstanding has been resolved,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the agreement, the women will receive $750  
back pay and $2,500 in additional compensation. They also will 
receive written apologies from the Atlanta-based company, which 
will provide religious sensitivity training at all of its domestic 
locations. 
</P>

	Argenbright provides conveyer security services at most of the  
nation's busiest commercial airports.

<HEADLINE>  Marine Faces Obstruction Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot had the right to remain  
silent about a cockpit videotape that was destroyed after his jet 
clipped an Italian ski gondola and killed 20 people, his lawyers 
argued at a court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys argued over the right against self-incrimination for  
several hours Wednesday, the day testimony was supposed to begin in 
Capt. Richard Ashby's trial on obstruction of justice charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stemmed from a videotape Ashby helped hide after the  
Feb. 3, 1998, accident near Cavalese, Italy. It was later 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's lawyers objected to what they said was a prosecutor's  
suggestion that Ashby's silence about the tape was evidence of his 
guilt. The judge, Col. Alvin Keller, agreed that the prosecutor's 
comments were improper but called a mistrial a ``drastic remedy'' 
and told the military jury to disregard the remark. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony was to begin today.  
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was acquitted in March of  
20 counts of involuntary manslaughter for the 1998 accident in 
which his EA-6B Prowler severed the gondola cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys acknowledged in opening statements that Ashby  
took the tape from the plane but only because his navigator, Capt. 
Joseph Schweitzer, asked him to. Ashby is accused of helping to 
destroy the videotape, and he could receive up to 10 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor, Lt. Col. Carol Joyce, said Ashby deliberately  
concealed evidence when he replaced the video with a blank tape. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to make his own judgment of that videotape,'' she  
said. ``He knew that after that flight, the tape would be nitpicked 
by investigators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joyce also said Ashby failed to tell authorities about the tape  
and invoked his right to silence before an Italian magistrate. 
</P>
<P>
	That statement prompted defense attorney Frank Spinner to  
complain that the government was saying that Ashby ``must be guilty 
because he elected to remain silent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby has admitted he gave the videotape to Schweitzer, 31.  
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, of Westbury, N.Y., said he threw the tape into a  
fire because he feared a frame on it of his smiling face might be 
used to vilify him and the rest of the crew in the Italian media. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and  
conspiracy to obstruct earlier this month. A jury sentenced him to 
dismissal from the service.

<HEADLINE> Economic Recovery Called Fragile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, disappointed with  
the failure to reach agreement with its major allies on a strategy 
to reform the global economy, warned on Wednesday that despite 
recent glimmers of an upturn in many crisis countries, ``it's still 
a dangerous world out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 182-nation International Monetary Fund and its sister  
lending agency, the World Bank, concluded four days of talks with 
pledges to intensify efforts to deal with weaknesses exposed by the 
Asian-currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	But they left most of the hard decisions until later. Some  
officials expressed concerns that recent rebounds in the markets of 
several of the countries leveled by the currency crisis over the 
last two years may have reduced a needed sense of urgency. 
</P>
<P>
	Emphasizing that markets can often become overly optimistic,  
Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said, ``The crisis 
has abated. But it's still a dangerous world out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin, speaking at the closing  
session Wednesday, warned, ``The challenge that the international 
community now faces is to maintain the focus established by the 
crisis on the need to strengthen the international system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issues that the finance ministers could not agree on  
included reforming the financial practices of emerging countries 
and requiring the private sector to bear a greater burden in future 
bailouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States also failed to convince Europe and Japan of  
the urgent need to do more to bolster their own economies as a way 
to take pressure off a soaring American trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	As the only major economy doing well, the United States has  
served as a market of last resort for many crisis-stricken Asian 
nations seeking to boost their exports as a way to lift themselves 
out of recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said it had to be a matter of concern for the global  
economy that the United States accounted for fully two-thirds of 
all economic growth in industrial countries last year, emphasizing 
the need for the two other major economic power centers, Japan and 
Europe, to do more. 
</P>
<P>
	While praising what he called an ``important evolution'' in  
which Japan has become much more serious about fiscal stimulus 
measures and overhauling its banking system, Summers said ``whether 
these actions will be enough to achieve the lasting recovery that 
Japan -- and the world -- have waited for so long is an unanswerable 
question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Summers also cautioned that Europe must guard against its past  
tendency to ``turn inward in economic matters. It will be critical 
for policy-makers to resist this temptation in the months ahead as 
the world works to achieve stronger and more balanced global 
growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, in his closing remarks  
Wednesday, voiced support for an initiative by World Bank President 
James Wolfensohn that would tie IMF efforts to help countries deal 
with currency crises more closely to World Bank programs to make 
sure the poor don't bear the brunt of the IMF reform programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin suggested that a few countries be selected for a pilot  
program to see if Wolfensohn's proposal will lead to more effective 
coordination between the IMF and World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	At the closing news conference, Wolfensohn told reporters that  
he did not consider it a setback that the finance ministers were 
not able to resolve differences that have been blocked the World 
Bank and IMF from providing greater debt relief to the world's 
poorest countries. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted President Clinton and other leaders of the world's  
seven richest nations would resolve the differences in time to 
announce agreement at their economic summit in Cologne, Germany, in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	On the sidelines of the meetings, Russian officials received  
assurances from the IMF that the agency will provide $4.5 billion 
in new loans over the coming 18 months if the country lives up to 
the economic reform promises it made late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief statement, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus  
said ``as soon as the measures have been implemented and I have 
received the necessary assurances, I shall ask the executive board 
to consider Russia's request.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Missile Strikes Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) -- NATO acknowledged today that a missile  
fired by one of its warplanes over Yugoslavia unintentionally 
landed in Bulgaria, apparently causing no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulgarian officials earlier said a NATO plane had violated the  
country's airspace Wednesday evening and one of its missiles 
slammed into a suburb of the capital, Sofia, about 30 miles west of 
the Yugoslav border. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, Belgium, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said today a  
NATO jet fighter launched the missile ``in self defense in response 
to the threat from a surface-to-air missile'' after a Yugoslav 
ground radar had locked on to the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	He said ``the missile strayed from its target and  
unintentionally landed in Bulgaria,'' which neighbors Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand that no civilians suffered a loss of life from  
what happened there,'' Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three NATO missiles have already struck Bulgaria's territory  
during the air campaign against neighboring Yugoslavia, and 
alliance planes have previously violated Bulgarian airspace. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulgarian air force officials identified the missile as  
laser-guided anti-radar AGM-88 Harm. They said it is usually 
carried by F-16 jet fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	In a meeting with U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Henry Kievenaar, a Defense  
Department official, Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov expressed 
``great concern'' about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Kievenaar said, ``I just want to express our deep regret on the  
missile incident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Minister Bogomil Bonev said Bulgaria would sue the  
pilot for material and moral damage caused to the house owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``There hasn't been such a drastic violation of our airspace so  
far,'' Bonev said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoyanov and Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mihailova urged NATO to  
supply Bulgaria with sophisticated radar equipment that can 
identify planes. They said Bulgaria would mark its western border 
with lights for better orientation of allied fliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the incident, the government will propose to parliament  
to provide NATO with a 70- to 90-mile air corridor along Bulgaria's 
western border, Bonev said. 
</P>
<P>
	The public is divided between desires to join NATO and the  
European Union and sympathy for fellow Slavs and Christian Orthodox 
Serbs in Yugoslavia.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a group, lawyers have been the most  
generous contributors to the presidential campaigns of both Vice 
President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers accounted for $1.4 million of the $8.9 million Gore

	A candidate's campaign committee can accept only $1,000 per  
person. Many firms bundled contributions from their employees to 
increase their impact, the study found. Lawyers from the 
Houston-based firm of Vinson &AMP; Elkins, for example, contributed a 
total of $172,400 to Bush's campaign. The money includes donations 
from spouses. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the biggest bundlers are law firms that also are  
registered to lobby on behalf of large corporations. Vinson &AMP; 
Elkins represents Bell Atlantic, Federal Express, and several Texas 
organizations, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	Other types of companies pool employees' contributions, as well.  
</P>
<P>
	The highest total Gore received from a single company was  
$67,950 from employees of Ernst &AMP; Young, an accounting firm that 
also lobbies. Its lobbying clients include Intel, the Federation of 
American Health Systems and MCI, now MCI Worldcom. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are active participants in politics on behalf of  
themselves and a wide range of clients,'' said Larry Makinson, 
executive director of the center, which studies the relationship 
between contributions and campaigns. ``They want to make sure 
they're on the inside no matter who wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore campaign spokesman Roger Salazar said the bundled  
contributions represented a small percentage of the vice 
president's donors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority of our supporters, over 75 percent, gave $100 or  
less,'' Salazar said. ``We think he's got support from people all 
across the country at all levels. They are all supporting the vice 
president for what he has to offer this country, which is the power 
of his ideas and his leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the donors gave  
``because he's done a great job as governor and they want him to be 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's only announced challenger for the Democratic presidential  
nomination, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, took in $646,150 
from lawyers. Overall, he raised $4.3 million during the first 
three months of 1999. Bradley's biggest bundler was the law firm of 
Winston &AMP; Strawn, which gave $37,500. Its clients include the Walt 
Disney Co., General Motors and American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that some companies had divided loyalties.  
</P>
<P>
	Employees of the investment firm of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.,  
contributed a total of $45,500 to Gore, $15,000 to Bradley and 
$9,000 to Bush. Salomon Smith Barney employees gave $16,500 to Gore 
and $20,000 to Bradley. The figures also include spouse 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The center did not analyze the contributions to other  
presidential candidates who had not filed electronically.

<HEADLINE> American Air, Pilots Label Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines' pilots union has agreed to  
label its battle with the airline a ``minor'' dispute, potentially 
altering the union's course of action as it appeals a contempt of 
court finding which has resulted in a $45 million fine. 
</P>
<P>
	In court documents filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court, the  
Allied Pilots Association conceded that its dispute with American 
over the purchase of Reno Air was ``minor'' under federal labor 
law. The disagreement resulted in a February pilots' sickout that 
cost the company millions of dollars when nearly 6,700 flights were 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	The concession that the action was minor undercuts its legal  
defense of the sickout. The pilots originally called the fight a 
major dispute, which merited the sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the airline and the union declined to  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	American and the union also agreed Wednesday to a permanent  
injunction barring the union and its members from any future 
actions -- including a strike, sickout or slowdown -- over the Reno 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	The clash reached a boiling point Feb. 6, when pilots began  
calling in sick. A federal judge held the union and its two top 
officers in contempt and fined them $45 million for ignoring his 
order to tell pilots to return to their cockpits. Judge Joe Kendall 
has not yet decided how the three parties will divide the fine 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute stemmed from the union's dissatisfaction with the  
airline over how Reno pilots would be absorbed into American. The 
union contends that Reno pilots should be integrated into American 
from the company's Dec. 23 purchase, raising salaries for those 
affected from that date. The airline says it will pay the higher 
rates as the pilots are retrained to American standards. The 
disagreement is currently before a federal mediator. 
</P>
<P>
	The union said in its filing that it was not acknowledging or  
admitting any violations of law or breach of duty or legal 
obligations.

<HEADLINE> Tennis Prize Money Differs by Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Don't look for a boycott of Wimbledon by women's tennis players  
angered over a decision to keep their prize money well below the 
levels earned by men. They're angry, but they're not ready to walk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect that,'' said Bart McGuire, CEO of the Women's  
Tennis Association. ``I believe boycotts, strikes and lockouts are 
atom bombs. I don't support that at this time. It's been 
established by the NBA and major league baseball that work 
stoppages are counter-productive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead McGuire said he would continue to pursue the Grand  
Slams, seeking to equalize the prize money. Only the U.S. Open 
offers the same payoffs to men and women. 
</P>
<P>
	While announcing a 5.4 percent increase in prize money to $12.16  
million, John Curry, chairman of the All England Club, rejected the 
WTA demand to make the women's payoffs equal to the men's. 
Wimbledon's men's winner will receive $728,000, and the women's 
winner will get $655,200. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's extremely disappointing,'' McGuire said. ``I view the  
Grand Slams as the leaders of the sport. The U.S. Open took a 
leadership position on this 25 years ago. The other two have been 
more responsive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon's payoff for the women is 83 percent of the men's  
figure. At the Australian Open, the women get 94 percent, and at 
the French Open, it's 90 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry said Wimbledon's payoff position is based on opinion polls  
of its patrons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do surveys of all the people who come on a regular basis  
and, in three surveys over the past 10 years, 70 percent of the 
people say that first and foremost the thing they want to watch is 
men's singles,'' Curry said. 
</P>
<P>
	McGuire said he had never seen any of the surveys and said  
television ratings for women's matches were consistently higher 
than for the men. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the Australian Open, of the 20 top-rated matches, 15  
including the top five were women's matches,'' he said. ``In eight 
of the last nine Grand Slams, in the United States the women's 
final ratings were higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGuire dismissed suggestions that the men should get higher  
payoffs because their matches in Grand Slam events are best-of-5 
sets instead of the best-of-3 played by the women. 
</P>
<P>
	``In actual stopwatch figures at Wimbledon a couple of years  
ago, in one hour on the court, the women played eight minutes and 
the men under four. Points are longer on the women's side on grass. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me ask you this: Would you rather watch a great two-hour  
movie or a great four-hour movie? 
</P>
<P>
	``Pavarotti doesn't get less for singing 2 1/2 hours of Verdi  
instead of 4 1/2 hours of Wagner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curry objected to the tone of the WTA demand for higher payoffs.  
</P>
<P>
	``(The women) have every right to request, but to demand it, I  
think, is hurtful and damaging to Wimbledon. It implies that we 
treat them unfairly and that's not true from the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the players enjoy playing Wimbledon and the prize  
money is only a small portion of their income.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGuire welcomed the decision by Wimbledon to increase women's  
doubles prize money by 10.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wimbledon's recognition of the increased strength of women's  
doubles is heartening,'' McGuire said. ``But its refusal to give 
the women a higher percentage of the singles prize money is 
extremely disappointing.''

<HEADLINE> Man Blocking Car Repossession Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- A 64-year-old man was shot to death when  
he tried to stop three people from repossessing his car, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men and a woman were being questioned by police about the  
shooting of William Miller, who died near his home early Wednesday. 
No charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was apparently awakened by an alarm on his 1988 Lincoln  
that sounded as the crew prepared to place the car on a hauler, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	With a revolver in hand and barefoot, he chased the truck around  
the corner where the three had stopped to secure the vehicle and 
confronted them, said police Lt. Walter Norris. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to determine whether there was an actual  
struggle,'' Norris said. ``We are trying to piece it together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a retired truck driver, had filed for bankruptcy in  
January 1998.

<HEADLINE>  Phillies Hit Three Straight Homers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Scott Rolen, Rico Brogna and Ron Gant hit  
consecutive home runs off Cincinnati's Brett Tomko in the first 
inning of the Philadelphia Phillies' game against the Reds on 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia had not hit three straight homers since July 26,  
1987, when Milt Thompson, Von Hayes and Mike Schmidt connected 
against Atlanta's Doyle Alexander in the eighth inning at Veterans 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	With two outs and none one, Rolen hit a liner to left-center  
field for his seventh homer of the season. Brogna followed with a 
drive to right for his fourth homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Gant, in an 0-for-10 slide and hitting just .121, followed with  
an inside-the-park homer. The ball went off the wall in 
right-center, bounced off the foot of centerfielder Mike Cameron 
and rolled into the right field corner as Gant sped around the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Gant's second homer of the season and the third  
inside-the-parker of his career. Gant became the first Phillies 
player to hit one since Juan Bell did it against Chicago on Sept. 
24, 1992.

<HEADLINE> 23 Arrested at Marilyn Manson Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) -- Shock rocker Marilyn Manson cut short  
his concert and abruptly walked off the stage when he realized 
someone had stuck a large yellow smiley face on a stage prop. The 
resulting rowdiness ended in 23 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 4,765 appeared stunned when Manson -- already the  
target of criticism this week alleging that his wild, ``gothic'' 
style influenced the Littleton, Colo., school shooting -- became 
angry Wednesday and stormed off the stage early. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in the crowd became rowdy and swarmed Manson's tour bus.  
Police arrested 23 people on charges of assault on an officer, 
interfering with police, disorderly conduct, trespassing and 
failure to disperse, police Lt. Jerry Potter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and security officers at the scene said there were  
several scuffles between officers and the crowd. There were no 
reports of injuries. It was not known if Manson was in the bus at 
the time of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the Five Seasons Center, 10 people were arrested on  
charges of public intoxication or possession of a controlled 
substance. Organizers had beefed up security at the center because 
of the controversy surrounding Manson. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennie Boddy, publicist for the band's record label,  
Nothing/Interscope Records, said today she would try to learn why 
Manson cut short his show. 
</P>
<P>
	Potter said Five Seasons Center personnel told him that Manson  
``somehow saw (the smiley face) at midpoint of the song and he 
became very upset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was the face, 2 to 2 1/2 feet across, ``large enough to  
make a presence,'' was stuck on the front of a prop that looked 
like a pulpit. It was visible to the audience but not, at first, to 
Manson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It struck me as very odd that it would be part of his stage  
presence when it was so uncharacteristic of everything else he was 
doing,'' Potter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tammy Koolbeck, marketing director at the Five Seasons Center,  
said no one in the crowd or the center's staff could have gotten to 
the prop to attach the smiley face. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was probably put on by one of his people,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside a Manson  
concert in Minneapolis, protesting possible links between his dark 
music and the Colorado school killings. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Manson announced the cancellation of next  
week's last five dates of his U.S. tour, saying it was out of 
respect for the victims of the shootings. Manson, who took his 
stage name from Marilyn Monroe and mass killer Charles Manson, said 
he blames the tragedy on ignorance, hatred and access to guns.

<HEADLINE> Rory Calhoun, TV's `Texan,' Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Rory Calhoun caught his first acting  
break while riding a horse, and his rugged image and handsome face 
propelled him from there. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun, the lanky lumberjack and a stalwart hero of Western  
movies and the TV series ``The Texan,'' died Wednesday at age 76. 
He had been hospitalized for 10 days with advanced stages of 
emphysema and diabetes, said his longtime friend, Paul Dean. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun often told the story of how he was discovered in 1943  
while he was horseriding in the Hollywood Hills. Alan Ladd, then a 
top star, happened to be out riding, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I met this fellow up in the hills and stopped to talk,''  
Calhoun recalled. ``He asked me if I was an actor, and I said, 
`Hell, no!' We talked some more and he asked, `How would you like 
to be in films?''' 
</P>
<P>
	His face and sturdy physique won him lesser roles in ``Something  
for the Boys,'' ``Sunday Dinner for a Soldier,'' ``The 
Bullfighters'' and other wartime films. His most important early 
role came as boxer James Corbett in ``The Great John L.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, whose real name was Francis Timothy Durgin, saw his  
career accelerate after a meeting with agent Henry Willson, who 
discovered and invented names for Rock Hudson, Tab Hunter and Troy 
Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
	He was considered ideal for such Westerns as ``Massacre River,''  
``Rogue River,'' ``Yellow Tomahawk'' and ``Four Guns to the 
Border.'' In the late '40s and early '50s, he also appeared in 
``The Red House,'' ``Ticket to Tomahawk,'' ``How to Marry a 
Millionaire,'' ``Meet Me After the Show'' and ``With a Song in My 
Heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From 1958 to 1960, Calhoun starred in a CBS television Western,  
``The Texan.'' He played Big Bill Longley, a fast gun who traveled 
from town to town helping those who were victimized by bad men. 
</P>
<P>
	In his later career, Calhoun appeared in lower budget films,  
many of them made abroad. Among the titles: ``The Treasure of 
Pancho Villa,'' ``Flight to Hong Kong,'' ``Marco Polo,'' ``The 
Colossus of Rhodes,'' ``Young Fury,'' ``Black Spurs'' and ``The 
Adventures of Marco Polo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982-87, he appeared on the CBS soap opera ``Capitol,''  
playing Judson Tyler, head of one of the two feuding families in 
the show. He also was host of reruns of ``Death Valley Days'' in 
the syndicated ``Western Star Theater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun was born in Los Angeles and grew up in Santa Cruz,  
Calif. He dropped out of high school to wander the West. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd read about Tombstone (Ariz.) and all of the bad men,'' he  
recalled. ``I was a wild kid for adventure. So I went to Tombstone, 
but I arrived 50 years too late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hired out as a bronco buster and mined silver near Reno  
before returning to Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1948, Calhoun married Latin entertainer Lita Baron, and they  
had three children. They divorced in 1970. In 1971 Calhoun married 
former journalist Susan Langley. They had a daughter before 
divorcing after five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were incomplete late Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan 'Conflicted' on Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said financial  
privacy poses an increasingly difficult dilemma for regulators, who 
must balance individual rights against the importance of 
information in business. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve chairman, testifying Wednesday before a  
House panel, also reaffirmed his disagreement with the Clinton 
administration over the shape of legislation to rewrite the 
financial services laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan was asked about a proposal adopted by the House  
Banking Committee last month that would restrict the sharing of 
certain information among affiliated banks, brokerage firms and 
insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the provision, customers' transaction data, such as  
checking account history, still would be allowed to be shared among 
affiliated financial companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Without commenting directly on the proposal, Greenspan said the  
issue of financial privacy ``is going to become increasingly 
difficult for our whole regulatory structure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm conflicted on this question,'' the central bank chief told  
the House Commerce subcommittee on finance. Greenspan said that as 
a libertarian, he understands the need to protect individual rights 
and privacy. Yet he said he recognizes the growing importance of 
information in the financial industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy proposal also would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Require banks and thrifts to disclose their privacy policies to  
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Make it a federal crime for anyone to misrepresent who he is  
for the purpose of obtaining someone's private financial data. One 
exception: licensed private investigators trying to locate the 
assets of fathers who owe child support. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision was targeted at the practice of pretext calling,  
in which people, including so-called ``information brokers,'' phone 
employees at banks and other businesses and use Social Security 
numbers to get information about bank accounts and other financial 
data. 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy proposal was part of legislation approved by the  
Banking Committee to lift Depression-era barriers separating banks, 
securities firms and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has expressed support for the bipartisan bill  
but has threatened to veto financial overhaul legislation pending 
in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In his testimony, Greenspan again put himself at odds with the  
administration's top economic policymaker, Treasury Secretary 
Robert Rubin, over the best approach to take to revamping the 
financial services laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration wants to let banks diversify through  
subsidiaries of the bank itself, not just through affiliated 
companies within the same parent holding company. That arrangement 
would increase the power of the Treasury's Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency, regulator of nationally chartered 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side, Greenspan and senior Republican lawmakers  
want to let banks get into other kinds of financial activities 
through a holding company. That would expand the Federal Reserve's 
role as a regulator. 
</P>
<P>
	``The long-term stability of U.S. financial markets and the  
interests of the American taxpayer would be better served by no 
financial modernization bill rather than one that allows the 
proposed new activities to be conducted by the bank'' as in the 
House bill, Greenspan told the lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	His criticism came despite revisions to the bill that were made  
in an effort to accommodate Greenspan's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also got a lukewarm reception from senior  
Republicans on the finance subcommittee and drew strong opposition 
from Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, a senior Democrat on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress tries again to rewrite the financial services laws  
and allow banks, brokerages and insurers to get more deeply into 
each other's businesses, there are fears about how customer 
information will be shared among affiliates of the big new 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer activists, including Ralph Nader, have maintained that  
the legislation would create serious privacy risks for Americans as 
the financial companies compiled profiles of customers' buying 
habits, hobbies and health information. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., a member of the finance  
subcommittee, said the Banking Committee's proposal would provide 
``little or no'' privacy protection to consumers.

<HEADLINE> Reno: Gun Owners Must Learn Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the aftermath of the Colorado school  
shootings, Attorney General Janet Reno recommended requiring 
would-be gun owners to demonstrate they know how to use a gun 
safely and legally. 
</P>
<P>
	She offered the idea while discussing the Colorado case during  
her weekly news conference Thursday. But she did not propose any 
specific test or licensing procedure, and Justice officials said no 
legislative proposals along this line are being prepared. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, President Clinton sent Congress a series of  
lesser gun control proposals, including tougher penalties on adults 
for transfer guns to children and a one-gun-a-month limit on 
handgun purchases. On Thursday, he sent a letter to House Judiciary 
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., asking that he ``bring these 
common-sense measures to a vote as quickly as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials hoped the Littleton, Colo., shootings  
would help these measures pass over the opposition of the National 
Rifle Association and gun control opponents among the Republican 
majorities in the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Littleton, besides being a horrible tragedy and a  
heartbreaking event, must be to this nation is a symbol that you 
cannot become complacent as you reach success in fighting crime,'' 
Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun homicides by juveniles have dropped sharply since 1993 and  
even deadly attacks inside schools have been declining in recent 
years, despite several high-profile incidents at suburban or rural 
schools in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to constantly be vigilant, recognize that there  
will be new phenomena, that we have an increasing number of young 
people, that they are more alone and at risk than at probably any 
time in our history, and that we've got to give them the tools to 
cope with a time and place that has been violent and has been 
dangerous,'' Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can never forecast all the new phenomena, as we could not  
forecast the crack (cocaine epidemic of the 1980s) and how it would 
develop, but we can be alert to new and changing patterns, and we 
can be prepared to move to deal with those issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the administration's new gun control proposals on the  
table, Reno renewed an idea she has suggested before but which the 
administration has never proposed as legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have got to do is make sure that before a person  
possesses a gun, they have exhibited by test that they know how to 
safely and lawfully use the weapon and by experience that they are 
capable of doing that,'' Reno said. ``Nobody, even the most ardent 
advocate of guns, wants somebody sitting across from them who 
doesn't know how to use the weapon, who doesn't know how to 
lawfully use the weapon, or who has exhibited an unwillingness to 
do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if she was advocating federal or state testing and  
licensing of gun purchasers, Reno replied, ``We've got to figure 
out how we address the issue. ... There could be different ways of 
doing it, and I think this is an area we should explore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She predicted the one-handgun-a-month purchase limit, if  
enacted, would ``diminish the number of guns that reach the streets 
for illicit purposes and get into the wrong hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno also said punishment alone will not end misuse of guns by  
juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to have to be prevention, intervention, punishment  
that's fair, firm and fits the crime, and then re-entry programs 
that give young people a chance to get off to a fresh start in a 
positive way,'' she said. ``One of the areas that we have got to 
look at is the whole category of offenders coming out in the age 
ranges of 16 to 35 who want to get off to a fresh start but can't 
because they have a prior record.''

<HEADLINE> McKesson HBOC Shares Plummet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of McKesson HBOC Inc. plummeted nearly 50  
percent Wednesday after the health care company said it would be 
forced to revise its fourth-quarter and 1998 earnings reports 
because it had improperly recorded software sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco-based company said transactions of $26.2  
million in the company's fourth quarter ended March 31, and $16 
million in prior quarters, were improperly counted because they 
were subject to contingencies. The company did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed that these items weren't identified  
sooner, but the company recognizes the importance of promptly 
disclosing this information and is doing so now,'' said chairman 
Charles W. McCall and president and CEO Mark A. Pulido in a joint 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson shares fell 48 percent, or $31.25, to $34.50 in trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange. It was the most actively traded 
stock on the exchange Wednesday, with more than 41 million shares 
changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 22, McKesson HBOC reported a net loss of $60.4 million,  
or 22 cents per share, for the quarter ended March 31, on revenue 
of $8.4 billion. The figures included special charges. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, it had net income of $237.1 million, or 84  
cents per share, on revenue of $30.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is now projecting a net loss of 27 per cents for the  
quarter, and earnings of 75 cents per share for the full year. It 
did not provide a comparable dollar figure. Officials said the 
audit process is continuing and additional contingent sales may be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both we and McKesson HBOC's board of directors and its audit  
committee are focusing on the processes we have in place in order 
to determine the steps necessary to ensure that this will not 
happen again,'' McCall and Pulido said. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson also lowered its 1999 earnings projection to $2.50 a  
share. Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. have been projecting 
earnings of $2.94 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	At least four law firms said they have been retained by  
investors to investigate whether to pursue a class-action suit 
against McKesson HBOC. All four said they will examine whether the 
company issued false and misleading statements that artificially 
inflated its income and earnings per share. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson HBOC is the largest pharmaceutical supply management  
and health care information technology company in the United 
States. McKesson acquired software maker HBOC in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Wednesday's announcement, shares were already well off  
their 52-week high of $89.75, set earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> EPA Seeks New Auto Pollution Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency is about  
to propose tough new pollution controls on motor vehicles that for 
the first time would require popular sport-utility vehicles to be 
as clean-running as automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil companies also would have to produce much cleaner gasoline  
under the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The stringent new requirements, some of which would be phased in  
over the next decade, were given the nod this week by the White 
House and could be announced any day, administration officials said 
Thursday. The officials spoke only on condition they not be named. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA has told auto and oil industry representatives that  
dramatic, although technologically feasible, reductions in tailpipe 
emissions and cleaner gasoline are needed if state and local 
officials are to cut smog and soot to meet federal air quality 
requirements as well as reduce dangerous toxic chemicals and soot. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Tier II auto emission controls would require  
automakers on a fleet average to cut smog-causing chemical 
emissions and other pollution by up to 80 percent and take into 
account SUVs, light trucks and minivans that comprise half of all 
vehicles sold. 
</P>
<P>
	SUVs and pickup trucks currently can emit two and three times as  
much smog-causing nitrogen oxide than automobiles, although some 
models are considerably cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
	In another new twist, the EPA will require that the oil industry  
reduce the amount of sulfur in gasoline by as much as 90 percent 
nationwide, according to sources familiar with the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the auto emissions and gasoline requirements would mirror  
what California already has proposed, although the two plans are 
not identical. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers have argued that they cannot meet the tougher  
tailpipe requirements without low-sulfur gasoline because sulfur 
inhibits pollution control equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision will define whether or not areas meet their  
federal health-based standards for smog and other pollutants,'' 
said William Becker, whose association represents state and local 
air pollution control officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The association has estimated that the proposed sulfur  
reductions in gasoline alone would cut smog-causing nitrogen oxide 
in half, equivalent to removing 54 million cars from the nation's 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
	The new requirements are not expected to be made final until the  
end of the year and then the automakers will be given until 2004 to 
begin phasing in the cleaner vehicles over a number of years. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations, considered by EPA officials as the agency's  
most important environmental initiative this year, are expected to 
unleash intense lobbying from the two powerful industries most 
affected -- oil and automobiles -- as both seek to mold it more to 
their liking. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers in recent months have become resigned to the  
prospects of much tougher pollution control requirements for both 
cars and SUVs, but have argued for more time to comply. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposal recently floated by auto manufacturers would cut  
average fleet nitrogen oxide emissions to 0.07 grams per mile for 
all vehicles, including SUVs and light trucks, by 2011. The average 
is 0.4 grams per mile currently for cars and 0.7 grams to 1.1 grams 
per mile for SUVs. 
</P>
<P>
	The automakers' proposal would have a phase-in that was two  
years longer than what the EPA had been considering and would 
condition the reductions on even stiffer sulfur reductions in 
gasoline than the EPA has had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have the cars and trucks converge is a big step forward,''  
Josephine Cooper, president of the Alliance of Automobile 
Manufacturers, said in a recent interview, adding that manufactures 
must have adequate time to comply -- and much cleaner gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	But with about one in every two vehicles sold now a light truck,  
SUV or minivan, environmentalists have argued that emission 
reduction gains will be lost if these vehicles are not required to 
meet as strict standards as automobiles and more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, said Samuel Leonard, General Motors' director for  
emissions and fuel efficiency, is that the exhaust from a large SUV 
has to be three times cleaner to meet the same gram-per-mile 
requirement as a car because the engine is doing three times the 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	The automakers have argued that they can't meet the new  
requiremetns unless sulfur levels in gasoline are cut from its 340 
parts per million now to 30 parts per million, or perhaps even 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a reduction would add 5 cents to 6 cents a gallon to the  
price of gasoline and require $4 billion to $5 billion in 
retooling, driving some small refiners out of business, the 
American Petroleum Institute has argued. The oil industry has 
proposed limiting low-sulfur gasoline to 22 Eastern states and for 
the time being cutting sulfur only in half. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA, according to sources, has stood firm on insisting  
low-sulfur gasoline be required nationwide. To ease the burden on 
small, mostly Western, refiners, the proposal would provide some 
flexibility, including an extended timetable.

<HEADLINE> Dominik Hasek, Sabres Flying High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The secret to Dominik Hasek's success might  
not lie in his technique, stamina and athletic ability after all. 
It might be the Buffalo goalie's intense concentration that gets 
him through those 40-shot nights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never look too far ahead,'' said Hasek, who played  
brilliantly -- even for him -- in the Sabres' surprising sweep of 
Ottawa in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, the two-time MVP and Olympic gold medalist who makes  
difficult saves look easy and shrugs them off afterward, made 40 
stops in Tuesday's 4-3 win. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory gave seventh-seeded Buffalo an improbable sweep of  
the second-seeded Senators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres don't know who they'll play in the Eastern Conference  
semifinals. Right now Hasek could care less. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to be ready always for the next game,'' Hasek  
said. ``Maybe it's going to be a four-game series or a seven-game 
series. I hope we win. Maybe we lose. You never know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek always gives Buffalo a fighting chance to win.  
</P>
<P>
	The victory over Ottawa triggered a shower of brooms onto the  
ice and sent the Sabres out of the gate as the playoffs' lead 
darkhorse. 
</P>
<P>
	It came five years to the day after Hasek battled New Jersey's  
Martin Brodeur for 125 minutes through four overtimes to decide 
Game 6 of the Eastern Conference quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	That night, Hasek made 70 saves in Buffalo's win, while Brodeur  
was the loser with 49. 
</P>
<P>
	The shots and saves piled up on Hasek in the Ottawa series  
quicker than lake-effect snow on Buffalo. Games 1 and 2 in Ottawa 
saw Hasek face 88 shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dom stole one game for us and he had an unbelievable second  
game,'' said Sabres defenseman Alexei Zhitnik, who scored the 
winner Tuesday. ``So he's on top of his game right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added defenseman Jason Woolley, ``The first game, that was a big  
psychological advantage for us. We were outplayed for 90 percent of 
that game. He came up with some unbelievable saves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My answer is always the same,'' Hasek said when confronted  
with his own greatness. ``I had a couple of good games. I played 
pretty well. It doesn't mean I'm going to play well again, you 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that anyone would be stunned to see Hasek have a few more  
good games. Or rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Hasek keeps playing like this, I could see Buffalo going a  
long way,'' Senators defenseman Jason York said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek handles a compliment the same way he disposes of an  
occasional insult hurled at the overachieving Sabres, or a hot 
drive from the point -- by knocking it aside. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's most important for us to leave these games behind us and  
think about the next games,'' Hasek said. ``I don't care what other 
people say. I don't want to prove anything to anyone. All I want to 
do is win the game. That's what I want, always.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The acrobatic Hasek allowed six goals on 162 shots in the  
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the Sabres upset Philadelphia and swept Montreal.  
Buffalo then fell to Washington in the conference final. Hasek 
allowed nine goals in three straight losses to the Capitals last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	This season he had a strong start and faltered before a groin  
injury sidelined him for 12 games between February and March. The 
injury allowed Hasek to rest up for the playoffs, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres also held Senators star Alexei Yashin to no points in  
the series despite Yashin's team-leading nine shots in Game 4. 
Buffalo captain Michael Peca and Vaclav Varada did most of the work 
on the frustrated Yashin. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Ottawa, the Sabres also got something they lacked for  
much of the season -- scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine Sabres scored goals against the Senators and 14 finished  
with points. Zhitnik, Varada (twice) and Erik Rasmussen, a rookie 
who shuttled between Buffalo and Rochester during the season, all 
scored their first playoff goals Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres' top scorer, Miroslav Satan, bruised his foot when a  
teammate's shot struck him during Sunday's Game 3. X-rays were 
negative, but Satan, a 40-goal scorer, was reduced to hobbling 
around on crutches for a couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's off the crutches now,'' forward Brian Holzinger said.

<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Apache Corp. is buying 22 producing fields and 16  
exploration leases from Shell Exploration and Production Co. for 
$715 million in cash, plus 1 million shares of stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale involves half of Shell's producing properties in  
shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico, but only one-fourth of 
Shell's daily gross production from those waters. Shell Exploration 
and Production, a subsidiary of Houston-based Shell Oil Co., said 
the deal is part of an effort to ``upgrade'' its Gulf of Mexico 
holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter van de Vijver, Shell Exploration and Production's  
president, said the company plans to focus on newer shallow fields 
and deepwater properties. The Apache sale involves wells at depths 
less than 700 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock portion of the deal is valued at $28 million, based on  
an average closing stock price in the days surrounding the 
announcement. Thursday, Apache's shares rose $3.31 1/4, or 12 percent, 
to $31.93 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says Kosovo Peace Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia announced today it has a new plan to solve  
the Yugoslav crisis and put an international peacekeeping force 
into Kosovo under U.N. control -- if NATO halts its airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Chernomyrdin, who heads Moscow's efforts on finding a  
political solution to the crisis, said he would present ``concrete 
proposals'' in Bonn, Rome and Belgrade today and Friday. But the 
key precondition is a halt to airstrikes, the former prime minister 
said before leaving Moscow for Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``What talks can there be otherwise? It is useless trying to  
resolve the problem under bombs,'' Chernomyrdin said. 
</P>
<P>
	There appeared little chance that Chernomyrdin's mission would  
produce any quick results. NATO has insisted it will not halt the 
airstrikes until Yugoslav forces pull out of Kosovo and are 
replaced by a peacekeeping force that includes alliance troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian plan calls for the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces  
from Kosovo and the deployment of a U.N. force with a substantial 
Russian component. Chernomyrdin did not say if NATO nations would 
participate in the proposed U.N. force. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. must play the key role in solving the crisis and  
restoring peace, Chernomyrdin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Balkans everything must be done under the aegis of the  
United Nations, which must play a colossal role in the 
settlement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin met with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan before  
leaving for Germany. Annan was to meet later today with President 
Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Foreign Minister 
Igor Ivanov. The foreign ministers of Greece and Canada were also 
to have talks with Russian officials on Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin has raised hopes several times in recent days of a  
diplomatic breakthrough, only to see nothing develop. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Russia might be willing to play a major role in a  
peacekeeping force in Kosovo, the Russian government is broke and 
Western nations would presumably have to foot the bill for Moscow's 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albanian refugees who have fled Kosovo might also not see  
Russian troops, who have strong sympathies with Yugoslavia, as a 
guarantee of safety for their return. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow has become the focus of efforts to find a peaceful  
solution to the confrontation between NATO and Yugoslavia. But 
there is no sign yet that NATO or Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic will make the concessions each side believes are vital to 
starting peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at the early stages yet,'' Annan said Wednesday. ``While  
the (NATO) alliance should remain firm, we should do whatever we 
can in search of a political settlement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has said it will not stop the bombings until Belgrade meets  
its demands. 
</P>
<P>
	Western countries have been encouraging Russia to act as a  
go-between with Yugoslavia, and Moscow has welcomed the chance to 
play a prominent role in trying to forge a peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia insists, however, it will not be dragged into the  
conflict militarily.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton OKs Schools Flexibility Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed legislation today  
giving states greater freedom in spending federal education dollars 
-- a modest achievement by Republicans and Democrats that was 
accorded a Rose Garden ceremony to showcase possibilities for 
bipartisanship. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, there have been days in the last few years when I'm  
not sure we could have gotten this many members of Congress to 
agree that today is Thursday,'' Clinton joked as he surveyed the 
dozen or more lawmakers witnessing his enactment of the ``Ed-Flex'' 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope now we're getting off to a good start and we'll keep on  
doing this,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar spirit, Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., said, ``I hope  
this is simply the first accomplishment. ... We must continue along 
this path'' of working together to improve schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Remarks from both sides of the aisle, however, suggested that  
was no sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Flexibility Partnership Act allows all states to  
receive waivers of certain federal education requirements in order 
to improve school and student performance. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton, before painstakingly marking his signature on the  
bill with more than a dozen pens that would become the lawmakers' 
souvenirs, threatened to undo the legislation if it didn't work the 
way Republican sponsors promised. 
</P>
<P>
	If states and school districts did not use their new flexibility  
to produce measurable results, Clinton said, ``and the money's 
being misspent under this law, then we'll revert to another 
system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pressed the GOP majority in Congress to take up his own  
education agenda: massive new federal funds for hiring teachers, 
modernizing and building schools, and testing students against 
national standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, in turn, criticized the Democrats' agenda as a  
``one-size-fits-all'' approach to fixing the nation's schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge President Clinton and his colleagues in Congress to  
help us to eliminate the federal middleman in Washington and 
empower our teachers and parents to improve public education at the 
local level,'' Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., chairman of the House 
Republican Conference, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed-Flex, which was the first substantive bill to emerge from the  
post-impeachment Congress, was approved overwhelmingly in the House 
and Senate last week. Its passage was cheered by Republicans who 
advocate allowing more local authority over nearly $11 billion in 
education spending this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation expands to all 50 states and the District of  
Columbia a program established in 1994 that freed 12 states and 
school districts from some rules for obtaining federal funds and 
let them establish their own programs under which they would be 
accountable for academic results. 
</P>
<P>
	It authorizes the Education Secretary to deny Ed-Flex status to  
states that fail to develop strict standards and assessments for 
measuring the progress of students and school districts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called for an expansion of the Ed-Flex pilot program  
last year in a speech to the National Governors' Association. 
</P>
<P>
	To stave off a threatened presidential veto, Republicans had to  
give up a provision allowing a portion of the $1.2 billion in this 
year's budget for Clinton's new teacher program to be used for 
special education needs. Instead, the bill says school districts 
with class sizes of 18 or fewer students may join with other 
districts to use the money for teacher training.

	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 40.09 at 10,885.54 after rising 13 points Wednesday to 
10,845.45, its second straight record high close. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite, hit hard in recent sessions on aggressive  
selling of technology issues, was down 34.29 at 2,516.08. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was down 7.36 at 1,343.55. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrials were led higher by financial stocks, which  
rose as interest rates fell. The 30-year Treasury bond yield was 
down to 5.52 percent from late Wednesday's 5.54 percent after the 
Labor Department reported that wages and benefits for American 
workers rose a moderate 0.4 percent in the first quarter, half of 
what analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-quarter gain in the department's Employment Cost Index  
followed a much larger 0.7 percent advance from October through 
December of last year. The department also reported that new claims 
for unemployment benefits declined last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks were big beneficiaries of the drop in  
bond yields. American Express was up 3 5/8 at 136 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Also advancing were economically sensitive, or cyclical, stocks  
that have been back in favor since Tuesday. Minnesota Mining and 
Manufacturing was up 1 5/16 at 85 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors continued to take profits in technology shares.  
Amazon.com was down 23 1/8 at 170 3/8. The online retailer reported late 
Wednesday a first-quarter loss of 23 cents, narrower than the 29 
cents analysts expected. However, the company expects its growth to 
slow and losses to increase as it continues to invest heavily to 
broaden its presence on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset  
Management, said that if indeed there is no inflation in the 
economy, the current advance in the shares of cyclical companies 
will be short-lived. Investors will soon gravitate back to 
so-called growth stocks, shares of companies that may not have yet 
produced strong earnings but are expected to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cyclical companies require a very robust economy with  
inflationary pressures in order to generate their earnings,'' 
Orlando said, ``whereas growth companies can make money regardless 
of the performance of the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald,  
disagreed. ``People are not buying the cyclicals because things are 
extraordinarily great now; they're buying them because the world 
economy is seen as improving in the future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks were again taking big hits as investors continued to  
take profits in that sector as well. Merck was down 1 1/4 at 69 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues were only slightly ahead of decliners,  
outrunning them by a margin of 8 to 7 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where volume came to 766.92 million shares, up slightly 
from Wednesday's pace.

<HEADLINE>  Walker Hits 3 Homers, Drives in 8 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Larry Walker of the Colorado Rockies hit his  
first three home runs of the season and drove in eight runs 
Wednesday night against the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker hit three-run homers in his first two at-bats against  
Jose Jimenez. After singling in the fifth, he hit a two-run homer 
off Scott Radinsky in the seventh for a 9-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	With a chance to tie the major league mark for home runs in a  
game, Walker grounded out in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker tied a team record for RBIs in a game set by Andres  
Galarraga on June 27, 1996, against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He has 
one other three-homer game, on April 5, 1997, at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker missed the first seven games of the season with a  
strained rib-cage muscle. He had his first multi-RBI game Tuesday 
with an RBI double and a sacrifice fly and entered the game with no 
homers and five RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	He became the first visiting player to hit three homers at Busch  
Stadium since Larry Parrish of Montreal on May 29, 1977.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Workers for Sale Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Sixteen cybergeeks auctioning themselves as  
an Internet server assembly team pulled their posting without 
explanation Thursday afternoon from the World Wide Web's largest 
bidding site. 
</P>
<P>
	In a novel listing posted on eBay, a team of managers and  
engineers for an Internet service provider went straight to the 
online auction house that usually sells things such as Beanie 
Babies and autographed baseballs. They were asking $3.14 million 
for their expertise in assembling an Internet server. 
</P>
<P>
	``The seller ended the auction. He did not give a reason when we  
talked to him,'' said Kevin Pursglove, an eBay spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a very brief conversation with them and they said they  
decided to remove it,'' he added. ``They didn't explain anything. 
We have no idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the group calling itself ``ispteam'' said  
Wednesday that ``A lot of people think it's a joke, but I'm totally 
serious with this.'' He could not immediately be reached for 
comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16 workers -- including a director, two managers, three  
engineers and five administrators -- claim they currently work, 
unhappily, for a Silicon Valley company. They kept their employer 
secret for fear of getting fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were just sitting around talking, watching our company  
disintegrate and watching all these great people leaving,'' he 
said. They had been working together for years, and hated the idea 
of splitting up. 
</P>
<P>
	Recalling a spoof in which a seller tried to auction off a  
16-year-old girl (eBay yanked the listing) and real bids for dinner 
with venture capitalist Steve Jurveston (the $10,000 winning bid 
went to charity), someone in the group jokingly suggested 
auctioning themselves off as a team on eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're like, 'Wait a minute. That's not a bad idea. That'll  
work!' '' said the spokesman, a 23-year-old software engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	He offered to take the initiative -- and posted the listing  
Tuesday night in the computers category. 
</P>
<P>
	``Team of 16 employees from major ISP willing to leave as a  
group,'' the item read. ``Group formed major ISP presence in 
Silicon Valley/US and is now looking for other challenges and 
requires an opportunity with a major player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The selling price reflected salaries, including $200,000 for the  
director and $190,000 for each engineer. ``That would give us all 
raises,'' the spokesman said. ``That's one of the benefits of 
putting this on the auction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They had some requirements: a $320,000 signing bonus, 401(k),  
stock options. And the company must be based in Silicon Valley or 
San Francisco. eBay would have gotten a commission of $39,260. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nowhere else in the world could this happen,'' said Jean  
Bagileo, vice president at the Silicon Valley headhunting firm 
David Powell, Inc. ``It's provocative, it's humorous, you kind of 
think it can't be true, but go figure. Evidently they're trying to 
avoid us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	eBay, which had almost 2 million items for sale Thursday, has  
had its share of odd auction items, but this was the first selling 
people, said Pursglove. Before pulling the item, they'd received 
three or four bids, he added.

<HEADLINE> IRS Disputes Whistleblower's Rating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Disputing its own years of positive job  
ratings, the IRS now says in court documents that a revenue agent 
who testified before Congress about taxpayer abuse had actually 
done inferior work since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston-based agent, Jennifer Long, responded with two sworn  
statements from current and former Internal Revenue Service 
employees who say they have suffered retaliation because of their 
testimony before the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is business as usual at the IRS,'' Long said in a  
telephone interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The court filings are part of a federal race and age  
discrimination lawsuit Long brought against the Treasury Department 
in 1997, shortly after her Finance Committee testimony. The IRS 
motion to dismiss the case was filed just as the IRS was moving 
April 15 to fire Long, a decision she called retaliation for her 
testimony. It has since been rescinded by top agency officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The attempt to dismiss Long was based on a 13-page summary of  
poor performance since 1997, when she first received unsatisfactory 
notices after nothing but stellar annual reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the IRS says in the court documents that Long's supervisors  
had questions about her work for years in spite of those positive 
annual ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since 1991, all of (Long's) managers have found her work  
consistently lacking in more than one critical element,'' the 
agency says. 
</P>
<P>
	Two managers say they gave her positive annual reviews because  
they'd only been her superiors for a few months and didn't feel 
comfortable changing her rating to a negative. One IRS manager, 
identified as Barbara Craney, said she was preoccupied with her own 
medical problems and was afraid to single Long out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although I gave Mrs. Long this fully successful rating, I did  
not think she deserved it,'' Craney says in court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	In her response filed Tuesday, Long calls the IRS allegations  
``part of a pattern of undue oppression and harassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long's performance, the response says, was ``evaluated as  
satisfactory until the very day that her supervisor became aware 
she was flying to Washington to testify before the Senate Finance 
Committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, IRS employee Michael Ayala and a former employee,  
Matthew Issman, say in sworn statements filed with Long's papers 
that they suffered retribution after their congressional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala, an analyst in the Atlanta office with 32 years'  
experience, says he was demoted after word got out that he might 
talk to CNN for a program on IRS misconduct. After his April 1998 
testimony in the Senate, Ayala says he was unfairly denied 
promotions and not permitted to complete work needed for 
higher-grade positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``My supervisor has advised other employees not to associate  
with me because I have reported IRS abuses to elected officials, I 
am a troublemaker, and it could damage their careers to be seen 
with me,'' Ayala says. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS spokesman Steve Pyrek said the agency could not comment  
beyond what was in the court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, two top IRS officials in Texas -- acting Houston  
District Director Michael Greenspan and Regional Commissioner Ladd 
Ellis of Dallas -- have been placed on paid administrative leave 
while an investigation into Long's near-firing continues. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Wenzel, the deputy IRS commissioner, this week installed top  
assistant Keith Jones as acting director of the Houston office 
until further notice. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memo to Houston employees, Wenzel said, ``We are trying to  
get to the bottom of a very serious allegation ... whether or not 
the handling of a specific employee situation constituted 
retaliation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Long said no investigator has spoken to her in the two weeks  
since her case first came to light. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing will change,'' she said. ``As soon as the press  
attention dies down, we'll go back to the way it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., is  
planning a new round of hearings this fall focusing in part on the 
Houston district.

<HEADLINE> Nazi Flag Flying Guard Keeps Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state cannot fire a prison guard who  
flew a Nazi flag from his home, despite fears that his presence 
could provoke racial violence by inmates, a state appeals court 
ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the five judges on the court said they were not  
convinced that Edward Kuhnel's presence as a guard threatens public 
policy interests in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing in state law or court precedent prohibits ``the presence  
within our prison system of those that display the Nazi flag, or 
any other flag that may be seen as symbolizing bigotry, racism or 
totalitarianism,'' Justice D. Bruce Crew III wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuhnel has been suspended since 1996 and has been paid $103,180  
while he fights to stave of dismissal from Eastern Correctional 
Facility, where the inmate population is 50 percent black and 30 
percent Hispanic. A lower court had ruled in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
	State prisons spokesman James Flateau said the decision would be  
appealed. ``Racism has no place in our society,'' Flateau said. 
``His mere presence in a prison could endanger staff as well as 
inmates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two dissenting judges said keeping racists from serving as  
prison guards is a legitimate safety concern.

<HEADLINE> Oxford Health Plan Narrows Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP)-- Oxford Health Plans announced a  
narrower-than-expected first-quarter loss Thursday as the health 
maintenance organization significantly cut its medical expenses and 
raised premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford lost $4.6 million, or 6 cents per share, compared to a  
loss of $45.3 million, or 57 cents per share, in the same period a 
year ago. Results beat Wall Street forecasts of a 35 cent loss, 
according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Including a tax gain of $7.8 million related to a sale of  
Oxford's Medicaid business, the company made a profit of $14.3 
million. Oxford had lost money the six previous quarters following 
an unexpected loss midway through 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford's revenues fell to $1.06 billion in the first quarter  
from $1.21 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop results from Oxford leaving the New York and  
Pennsylvania Medicaid programs and the company's decision to no 
longer cover Medicare clients in several counties. Oxford now has 
1.69 million members, down from nearly 1.9 million members at the 
end of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford officials said they expect to have a profit for 1999,  
although the company still expects to have a loss in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to leaving several unprofitable Medicare and  
Medicaid markets, Oxford gained by increasing premiums an average 
of 9 percent. Nationally, most health plans hiked premiums between 
5 percent and 10 percent this year to keep up with rising medical 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	To contain health costs, Oxford this year required all of its  
small employers to institute a three-tiered pharmaceutical benefit, 
in which enrollees pay $10 for a generic drug, $15 for a preferred 
brand-name drug, and at least $30 for a non-preferred brand-name 
drug. In addition, Oxford renegotiated contracts with pharmacy 
benefit managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford also slashed fees to specialists.  
</P>
<P>
	The moves worked. Oxford spent 84.9 cents of each premium dollar  
on health costs in the first quarter, down sharply from 89.4 cents 
in the fourth quarter. That ratio is a key indicator of an HMO's 
fiscal health. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company is well along on following through with its  
turnaround plans,'' said Gary M. Frazier, an analyst with BT Alex 
Brown. ``Their medical management and recontracting efforts are 
taking hold with a lot more teeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford shares lost more than half their value after the company  
revealed in October 1997 it would report an unexpected 
third-quarter loss due to problems monitoring expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford shares, which rose earlier this week, fell $1 on Monday  
to $19.75 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.

<HEADLINE> Safety of Anthrax Vaccine Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional investigators questioned the  
long-term safety of an anthrax vaccine administered to America's 
armed forces despite government assurances Thursday that U.S. 
troops are being protected, not harmed by the shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeptical lawmakers suggested the Defense Department shouldn't  
continue mandating anthrax vaccinations until further studies 
ensure there won't be health problems later. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we using our service men and women as guinea pigs?'' asked  
Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., a member of a House Government Reform 
Committee panel that held a hearing on the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of  
Congress, found no data on long-term effects of the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwai Chan, a GAO official, said federal health and drug safety  
officials have only looked at whether the vaccine appears to 
protect people from anthrax and whether there were any immediate 
adverse reactions to inoculation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The long-term safety of the vaccine has not yet been studied.  
Therefore one cannot conclude there are no long-term adverse 
effects,'' Chan told lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its introduction three decades ago to protect mill and  
textile workers, Chan said there have been no reports of fatalities 
or major illnesses caused by the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some of the 150,000 Gulf War veterans who received the  
vaccine suspect it may be a factor in their mysterious maladies, 
including fatigue, headaches and nerve disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen last year ordered all 2.4  
million active duty and reserve troops to get the anthrax vaccine 
as protection against biological warfare. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 220,000 service members have been immunized so far,  
the Pentagon said, with 42 reporting adverse effects -- seven 
serious enough to be hospitalized or take a sick day. All recovered 
from complaints including soreness, rashes, headaches and fevers, 
U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 100 and 200 service members have refused the vaccine,  
according to Pentagon estimates. Those who reject the shots can be 
dismissed for refusing a direct order. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthrax has never been used in combat, but the Pentagon fears  
Iraq, North Korea and other countries -- or terrorist groups -- might 
try. Anthrax is a naturally occurring bacteria found in 
domesticated animals; it can be produced as dry spores that, when 
inhaled, cause death within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration licensed the vaccine in 1970  
based on animal studies and on the experience of how well the 
vaccine worked for those inoculated since the 1950s. It is 
considered 92.5 percent effective, early studies showed. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Janice Schakowsky, D-Ill., said she was concerned there  
were no studies showing how well the vaccine protects against 
inhaling anthrax spores in a warfare or terrorism scenario. 
Instead, experience focuses on subcutaneous infection. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we don't know is just so overwhelming,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Katherine Zoon, an FDA official, said federal authorities  
have received 101 complaints of adverse effects from the anthrax 
vaccine since 1990, only 14 of them serious. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the anthrax vaccine is a safe and effective vaccine  
for the prevention of anthrax disease,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brig. Gen. Eddie Cain, head of the Pentagon's biological defense  
program, called the anthrax vaccine a ``key element'' of the 
military's modern force protection program.

<HEADLINE> Texas Rangers President Steps Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON (AP) -- Tom Schieffer stepped down as president of the  
Texas Rangers today to spend more time developing the real estate 
around The Ballpark in Arlington. 
</P>
<P>
	Schieffer left open the possibility that he would help good  
friend Gov. George W. Bush run for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see the governor become president. Whatever he  
would like me to do, I'd like to help,'' Schieffer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schieffer, 51, who has been club president since January, 1991,  
will remain as a consultant for the club to help develop real 
estate around The Ballpark in Arlington, the Rangers' home field, 
team spokesman John Blake said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Fort Worth oil and gas lawyer who served three terms in the  
Texas House of Representatives, Schieffer has spent 11 years with 
the Rangers. He was an original investor in the ownership group 
headed by Bush and Rusty Rose that bought the team in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	When Schieffer became club president, he declined to promise  
pennant winners, but said, ``I think we can guarantee that the 
nachos are fresh, that the restrooms are clean and that the beer is 
cold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Bush was elected governor in November 1994, Schieffer  
succeeded him as the team's general partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Schieffer spearheaded the team's drive for a new stadium, The  
Ballpark in Arlington, which opened in 1994 to rave reviews for its 
old-fashioned appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	The club, which moved from Washington, D.C., to Texas for the  
1972 season, suffered through many mediocre seasons before finally 
reaching the playoffs in 1996 and again last year. But in both 
years, the Rangers lost postseason series to the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have noted that attendance at the stadium in suburban  
Arlington -- more than 32,000 fans per game this year -- has trailed 
that of other retro-looking stadiums in downtown settings, 
including those in Baltimore, Cleveland and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference means less revenue for the club, which signed  
All-Star catcher Ivan Rodriguez to a $42 million contract in 1997, 
spent $63 million more last offseason to sign first baseman Rafael 
Palmeiro and shortstop Royce Clayton, and is now trying to re-sign 
outfielder Juan Gonzalez. In the offseason, the team failed in 
efforts to sign star pitchers Roger Clemens and Randy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Schieffer said recently, building the stadium gave the  
Rangers an advantage over other teams, which were trying to catch 
up to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Rangers are trying to develop the land around The  
Ballpark to create more of a downtown ambiance. Schieffer said 
recently he hopes that in 10 to 15 years, the area around the 
stadium will resemble a downtown the size of Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	Schieffer said because of a $62 million payroll the team lost  
$3.5 million last season despite drawing 2.9 million fans. The 
Rangers could finish this season $14.6 million in the red for new 
owner Tom Hicks, Schieffer said.

<HEADLINE> Gordon Seeks Comeback in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FONTANA, Calif. (AP) -- Moments after Jeff Gordon crashed last  
Sunday in Talladega, crew chief Ray Evernham -- caught up in the 
heat of the moment -- lamented the elite team might be out of the 
championship battle after only nine races. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people misunderstood what Ray was saying,'' Gordon  
said Thursday as his Hendrick Racing team prepared his No. 24 
Chevrolet for today's opening of practice and qualifying for the 
California 500. ``I had just crashed and he took it kind of hard. 
But Ray never gives up -- ever. Nobody on this team does.' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, the two-time defending Winston Cup champion and winner  
of three of the last four titles, was fifth in the standings after 
nine races last year, and that's exactly where he is this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference is he trails series points Jeff Burton by 210  
points, considerably more than he ever fell behind last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not frustrating to me. It's just part of life and part of  
racing,'' Gordon said ``It does feel a little funny to be that far 
behind already. But we've still got plenty of time to get it going. 
All we have to do is starting putting together some more top fives 
and top 10s. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team right now is performing excellent. It doesn't help,  
though, when I keep destroying cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, who has never been known as a crasher, has hit the wall  
twice already this season. One of those times was last month at 
Texas Motor Speedway when he cut down a tire and hit very hard. The 
other crash was at Talladega after getting caught in an incident 
ignited by rookie Tony Stewart and Mike Skinner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I got through it, but I didn't quite make it and I  
was kind of mad at myself. I thought I could have got through 
there,'' Gordon said. ``But I know we're still in this thing pretty 
solid. If we can just slide some wins in every once in a while, we 
can move up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far this season, Gordon has those three finishes of 36th or  
worse, but he's also won twice and finished no worse than sixth in 
his other starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys are certainly not out of it,'' Burton said when  
asked about Gordon for at least the 100th time this week. ``I think 
he's still the favorite, but Jeff's not the only one you've got to 
beat for the championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, who leads Dale Jarrett by 40 points and Roush Racing  
teammate Mark Martin by 85 heading into Sunday's race at California 
Speedway, noted its consistency that has won the championships for 
Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like we have any pressure on us at all,'' Burton  
said. ``Those other guys have all the pressure, because they're 
behind. But we have to go run the next 20 races with a sense of 
desperation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to get a bunch of top 10s and top fives, race hard and  
not get in wrecks. It's just such a long season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon is looking at exactly the same formula, and he has done  
it before. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's something Ray reminded me about the other day,''  
Gordon said. ``He's real good at keeping me and the rest of the 
team positive and he pointed out that we won 10 races last year 
after the (Coca-Cola) 600 (in May). 
</P>
<P>
	``We can still have a great season even if we don't win the  
championship, but the championship is still our ultimate goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-mile California oval could be the place that vaults him  
back into serious contention. In the first two Winston Cup events 
at the track 60 miles east of Los Angeles, Gordon has a win and a 
fourth-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like this place and it's been pretty good to us,'' he said.  
``But we know we can't afford too many more big slipups like 
Talladega.''

<HEADLINE> Mich. Court Delays Riot Case Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- The Michigan Supreme Court has  
indefinitely postponed an order requiring 11 news organizations to 
turn over unpublished photographs and video of a riot at Michigan 
State University. 
</P>
<P>
	News organizations had until today to turn over the materials,  
which prosecutors say they need to investigate the March riot that 
followed Michigan State's loss in the NCAA basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a ruling late Thursday, the state Supreme Court postponed  
the deadline while it considers whether to hear an appeal from the 
news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Herschel Fink, an attorney for the Detroit Free Press, said that  
if the state Supreme Court refuses to grant an appeal, the media 
outlets may not pursue the case any further. 
</P>
<P>
	The news outlets contend that turning over unpublished photos  
and video would compromise their ability to gather the news. Fink 
has said that such orders place reporters in jeopardy by forcing 
them to act as agents of the police. 
</P>
<P>
	Two lower court judges have ruled the materials aren't protected  
because the riot was filmed in a public place and media laws are 
only meant to protect confidential sources. The judges have also 
ruled that people filming the riot were witnesses to crimes and are 
therefore compelled to give evidence to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Free Press, media involved in the case are  
the Lansing State Journal, The State News -- Michigan State's 
student newspaper -- and eight television stations.

<HEADLINE> Students Make Pledge in Colo School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The day after 15 people were gunned down  
at a Colorado school, Hillsboro High School junior Rebecca Hunter 
had an idea. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't have anything to do with dress codes or police in the  
hallways or metal detectors at the doors. She and her classmates in 
an American Studies course instead came up with a pledge to no 
longer taunt those who dress, talk or act differently. 
</P>
<P>
	Students and teachers are spreading copies of the pledge  
throughout the country via computer. The idea has intrigued 
teachers as far away as California. 
</P>
<P>
	The pledge was signed by 850 students in one day at Green  
Mountain High School in Jefferson County, Colo., the same county 
where Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, killed 12 students, a 
teacher and themselves on April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	By Thursday, more than 1,100 of the school's 1,500 students had  
signed the pledge, Green Mountain geography and sociology teacher 
Heather Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real positive thing the kids can do,'' she said. ``They  
realize they're in control of their own behavior and they have 
something to stand behind and say, `You signed your pledge card, 
why are you talking like that?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hunter said students were thrilled with the interest.  
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it'd be good just to encourage people to be nice  
and not make others feel like outcasts, because (Harris and 
Klebold) apparently felt like everybody was against them,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She doesn't think the pledge cards can eliminate cliques, just  
``encourage common courtesy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hillsboro High, a public school in an upscale area, has a  
diverse student body ``with a reasonable degree of harmony,'' 
principal Jean Litterer said. 
</P>
<P>
	A uniformed police officer patrols the hallways and three bomb  
threats were called in last year. But most students consider their 
school safe. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the pledge, junior Doug Conway said he won't sign because  
``I just don't think I can do it. I'm not a mean guy and I respect 
the idea behind it, but if you sign it you should follow through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Griggs, another junior, said he didn't sign because he  
doesn't need to be reminded to be nice. But senior Jonathan Terry 
vowed to take the pledge's values ``to heart and do what's right.''

<HEADLINE> Testimony Begins in Cable Car Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot whose jet killed 20  
people at an Italian resort tried twice to return to his damaged 
jet after it landed, a witness said today as testimony began at the 
pilot's obstruction of justice trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident happened after Capt. Richard Ashby flew his  
crippled EA-6B Prowler back to the Aviano, Italy, air base after it 
had clipped a gondola cable, sending a ski lift gondola plunging 
into an alpine valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Master Sgt. Richard Henry, the fire chief at Aviano, testified  
today that a man who said he was the pilot twice asked to get into 
the cockpit as Henry and his 17-man crew surrounded the damaged 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``He identified himself as the pilot and stated he needed to get  
back in the aircraft to retrieve a map and some other equipment,'' 
Henry said. He said both requests were denied. 
</P>
<P>
	The first witness to testify, Cpl. Elija Packman, said he  
brought videotapes to the jet before it left on the fatal training 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby is on trial for obstruction of justice and conspiracy.  
While he has admitted helping destroy a videotape made earlier in 
the flight, before the accident, he has maintained he did not 
intend to obstruct justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Packman testified after prosecutors announced they would not  
appeal a ruling by the judge, Col. Alvin Keller, that bars them 
from raising the issue of Ashby's silence about the videotape as 
evidence of his guilt. Keller denied a defense motion for a 
mistrial Wednesday after a prosecutor alluded to Ashby's silence in 
her opening statement, although he said the comments were improper. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's attorneys argued he had a constitutional right to remain  
silent after his jet clipped the gondola cable near Cavalese, 
Italy, on Feb. 3, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys haggled over the self-incrimination issue for several  
hours Wednesday, the day testimony was supposed to begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was acquitted in March of  
20 counts of involuntary manslaughter for the accident in which his 
EA-6B Prowler severed the gondola cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys acknowledged in opening statements that Ashby  
took the tape from the plane but only because his navigator, Capt. 
Joseph Schweitzer, asked him to. Ashby is accused of helping to 
destroy the videotape. He could receive up to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor, Lt. Col. Carol Joyce, said Ashby deliberately  
concealed evidence when he replaced the video with a blank tape. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to make his own judgment of that videotape,'' she  
said. ``He knew that after that flight, the tape would be nitpicked 
by investigators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joyce also said Ashby failed to tell authorities about the tape  
and invoked his right to silence before an Italian magistrate. 
</P>
<P>
	That statement prompted defense attorney Frank Spinner to  
complain that the government was saying that Ashby ``must be guilty 
because he elected to remain silent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby has admitted he gave the videotape to Schweitzer, 31.  
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, of Westbury, N.Y., said he threw the tape into a  
fire because he feared a frame on it of his smiling face might be 
used to vilify him and the rest of the crew in the Italian media. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and  
conspiracy to obstruct earlier this month. A jury sentenced him to 
dismissal from the service.

<HEADLINE> Fiesta Bowl Supports New Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Fiesta Bowl endorsed the proposed Rio  
Salado Crossing stadium and convention center project Thursday and 
strongly hinted the game would be moved there if the stadium is 
built. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came less than three weeks before voters in  
Mesa and two smaller communities vote on the $1.8 billion project, 
which includes a stadium that would be home to the NFL's Arizona 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is increasingly apparent to us that Rio Salado's combined  
strengths of convention facilities, meeting facilities and stadium 
facilities make it a winner for Arizona and vital for the Fiesta 
Bowl,'' said Fiesta Bowl executive director John Junker. 
</P>
<P>
	Junker stopped short of saying the Fiesta Bowl definitely would  
move from Sun Devils Stadium at Arizona State University. He said 
that decision would come later. 
</P>
<P>
	But his words left little doubt what the Fiesta Bowl would do if  
Rio Salado is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is increasingly clear that the recent wave of new  
facilities built or planned around the nation could be a threat to 
our very existence ... The Rio Salado Crossing project will allow 
the Fiesta Bowl to continue its economic impact as a major 
destination for fans across America,'' Junker said in a news 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rio Salado project includes a convention center, hotels,  
shops, restaurants, golf courses, hiking trails and parks. But at 
its heart is a 67,000-seat stadium that could be expanded for 
special events, such as the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium would have a retractable roof and a natural grass  
field. 
</P>
<P>
	The project would be built on the northern edge of Mesa, just a  
few miles east of Sun Devil Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Mesa voters will decide May 18 whether to approve a quarter-cent  
sales tax and extend an existing ``quality of life'' tax to pay for 
a share of the project. State sales tax revenue would pay for 
another chunk, and the Cardinals have pledged $75 million, although 
much or all of that could be recovered because the team would have 
the right to sell the stadium's name to a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters in the smaller towns of Queen Creek and Gilbert also will  
vote, but are not subject to the tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of the Fiesta Bowl, coupled with the loss of the  
Cardinals, would be a severe financial blow to Arizona State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls indicate the May 18 vote is close, and the Fiesta Bowl  
executive board's decision to announce its endorsement was 
calculated to help sway the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Rio Salado Crossing simply makes sense,'' said Fiesta Bowl  
president Win Holden. ``We believe that it not only not only makes 
sense for the long-term business health of the Fiesta Bowl but, 
most importantly for the people of Mesa, Gilbert, Queen Creek and 
the valley as a whole.''

<HEADLINE> Copper Futures Rise Sharply  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Copper futures rose sharply Thursday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange amid optimism construction demand in Asia is on the 
rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, sugar futures rose sharply, as did unleaded  
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper rose amid heavy fund buying tied to recent news reports  
that indicate Japan is struggling to pull itself and other Asian 
nations out of a recession that has hobbled construction for more 
than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Asia had become key in helping reduce oversupply before the  
economic crisis struck, and a sharp slowdown in demand for copper 
in plumbing, wiring and other electronics caused inventories to 
swell. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan recently began loaning other Asian nations billions to  
help stimulate industrial output. Its own stimulus package helped 
it in March post the first increase in construction orders in 15 
months, while South Korea saw the biggest increase in more than 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper for June delivery rose 1.65 cents to 72.05 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures bounded higher on the Board of Trade of the City  
of New York after Iran purchased Brazilian and European Union 
sugar. It bought Australian sugar a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The news came amid speculation Russian merchants also have been  
quietly buying sugar, which fell to 14-year lows recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices were expected to remain under pressure for the  
foreseeable future. Brazil, the world's largest producer, is 
expected to produce a second consecutive record crop, which begins 
harvesting in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the concerns were reports that Thailand's milled  
production is coming in more than 18 percent higher than last 
year's weather-reduced output. 
</P>
<P>
	May sugar rose .32 cent to 4.42 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline rose sharply, pulling crude higher on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange, amid fears oil producer cutbacks could lead 
the spot shortages during the peak driving season. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures soared above $18 a barrel Wednesday after  
weekly inventory figures showed sharp declines, signaling producers 
are adhering to promised cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude jumped after the American Petroleum Institute reported  
U.S. inventories tumbled 4.7 million barrels last week to 336.4 
million barrels after a sharp decline in imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline -- nearly four times the size of analysts'  
expectations -- was the first strong indication that world oil 
producers are finally serious about slashing daily output to 
sustain higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and  
other key producers agreed to remove 2.1 million barrels daily from 
the market beginning April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have said if they succeed at reducing about two-thirds  
that amount, supplies would be cut enough to force prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
	American inventories now are 6.6 million barrels lower than this  
time a year ago and could get smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	May unleaded gasoline rose 1.33 cents to 55.22 cents a gallon;  
June crude rose 8 cents to $18.53 a barrel.

<HEADLINE> NEA Funds Would Expand Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Youngsters at risk of trouble with the law  
would benefit from federally funded art projects under a $52 
million budget increase sought Wednesday by the National Endowment 
for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's budget projects $150 million for the NEA in  
the budget year beginning Oct. 1, up from the $98 million Congress 
appropriated for the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	NEA officials said $50 million of the proposed funding increase  
would go for a five-part program called ``Challenge America,'' 
which includes a segment entitled ``Youth at Risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Challenge America'' is a new program that would award grants  
of $5,000 or $10,000 for arts education and other arts projects in 
cooperation with local agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	NEA Chairman William J. Ivey, testifying before a House  
appropriations subcommittee, cited the effectiveness of a pilot 
program in Birmingham, Ala., called ``Space One-Eleven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Children have a safe place to go and an opportunity to engage  
in the creative process,'' Ivey said. ``There, the children work 
with ceramics, and our $10,000 grant will help them establish a 
storefront laboratory to display and sell their artwork to people 
in the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In that and other pilot programs, he said, at-risk youths  
``developed greater resistance to peer pressure, and perhaps most 
importantly, they had fewer court referrals.''

<HEADLINE> Two Hoop Players Leave Wildcats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Center Michael Bradley, who set a  
Kentucky record for field goal percentage, and guard Ryan Hogan 
have left the team, giving the Wildcats only seven returning 
scholarship players. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's departure creates a potentially gaping hole at center  
for the Wildcats, who are still awaiting a decision by Bradley's 
backup, Jamaal Magloire, on whether he'll leave early for the NBA 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed that Mike and Ryan have decided to leave the  
University of Kentucky, but we wish them well in their future 
endeavors,'' coach Tubby Smith said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was unavailable for further comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky athletic director C.M. Newton said both players told  
him they thought it was in their best interests to transfer without 
giving any further reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing when you have any young man leave your  
program prematurely,'' he said. ``In this particular situation, 
it's some concern because of the timing of it. It's very late for 
us to be notified of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newton said the rash of transfers in college basketball this  
spring is ``not just a Kentucky problem, but a national problem'' 
that needs to be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats, meanwhile, added one inside player Thursday when  
junior-college transfer Nate Knight, a 6-foot-8, 220-pound 
forward-center, signed a national letter of intent to play for the 
Wildcats. Knight is the younger brother of Los Angeles Lakers 
forward Travis Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats still have three available scholarships to give if  
Magloire decides to return for his senior season, and four if he 
departs, team spokesman Brooks Downing said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, a 6-10 center, started all 37 games last season and  
averaged 9.8 points and 4.9 rebounds in 21.9 minutes per game. 
</P>
<P>
	He briefly led the nation in field goal percentage and finished  
the season shooting a school-record 65.7 percent from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan, nephew of former Kentucky star Kevin Grevey, started  
twice and played in 35 of 37 games. He averaged 3.7 points in 9.5 
minutes per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley and Hogan have not decided where they will transfer, the  
school's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither player was available for comment. Bradley's father,  
David, said he couldn't comment when reached at his home in 
Worcester, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's departure creates big questions about the Wildcats'  
inside game, once expected to be a strength. 
</P>
<P>
	John Stewart, a 7-foot Kentucky recruit from Indianapolis,  
collapsed and died while playing in an Indiana high school regional 
tournament in March. Another Kentucky recruit from the fall, 6-9 
forward Marquis Estill of Richmond, Ky., has undergone surgery on 
both knees. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky finished 28-9 last season, falling one game short of  
making its fourth straight NCAA tournament Final Four appearance. 
The Wildcats will add two highly touted freshmen next season, 6-10 
forward Marvin Stone of Huntsville, Ala., and 6-4 guard Keith 
Bogans of Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, who will be a junior next season, averaged 14.5 points  
per game and a conference-leading 8.9 rebounds last season for Utah 
Valley State College. He shot 60.4 percent from the field and 60.9 
percent from the free throw line in helping lead the Wolverines to 
a 24-8 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight is the Wildcats' first signee this spring, and becomes  
the first junior-college transfer to join the Wildcats since Rodney 
Dent, a 6-10 center who played for Kentucky in 1993 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very excited about Nate joining our ballclub,'' Smith  
said. ``His quickness and agility will fit perfectly with our 
uptempo style of play, and his experience and maturity will be 
important on our front line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight played as a freshman at Oregon State, where current  
Kentucky assistant George Felton recruited him. He appeared in 24 
games for the Beavers in 1996-97, averaging 3 points and 3.2 
rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight left Oregon State after his freshman season and served a  
Mormon mission for one year before transfering to Utah Valley 
State.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Protest Arrest Plan Challenged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Two congressmen challenged the right of the  
Baltimore Orioles to prevent protests inside Camden Yards during 
Monday's game against the Cuban national team, with one suggesting 
lawsuits against the team are likely if peaceful demonstrators are 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we have the time to try to challenge them in  
court, although there may be those who will seek to express 
themselves peacefully,'' Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they are arrested, they may have a lawsuit on their hands  
since I understand the stadium was built with public funds. So, I'm 
not sure they have an absolute right to control free speech in the 
manner in which they are trying to control it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles have announced strict guidelines for fan conduct  
will be enforced, and fans may be asked to leave, even for 
chanting, if it disturbs other fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Banners will not be allowed to be displayed during play and  
political and commercial messages will be banned. Fans will be 
warned once and will be escorted out of the stadium if they 
persist, the team has said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Banners and flags are prohibited,'' said John Maroon, a team  
spokesman. ``It's a longstanding club policy that anything 
political in nature is inappropriate and, at the discretion of the 
Orioles, shall not be displayed at the ball park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans have a constitutional right to conduct a peaceful  
protest and will be given an appropriate and visible place to do 
that outside the gates of the ball park,'' Maroon added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles have also sold tickets in pairs, making it difficult  
for larger groups to sit together, Cuban exile groups have 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Ana Gamonal, a spokeswoman for Florida congressman Lincoln  
Diaz-Balart, said she believes the team may be within its rights to 
ban political protests inside the stadium. But she expected members 
of Cuban exile groups would take advantage of the warning policy to 
display banners once. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they do it once, then it's OK,'' Gamonal said.  
</P>
<P>
	She also questioned whether the Orioles were legally able to ban  
political protests in the stadium's parking lots. Groups seeking to 
either protest Fidel Castro's regime or call for an end to the 
United States' embargo of the island will be allowed to protest in 
designated areas, the team has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Menendez said he expects up to a thousand anti-Castro protesters  
from the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area to board buses for 
Baltimore on Monday. More are expected from Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Menendez has been an outspoken critic of the Orioles' exhibition  
games with Cuban teams, saying human rights abuses by the Castro 
regime are being overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be incredible if people are arrested for  
displaying a sign, chanting a phrase, or displaying the American 
flag,'' Menendez said.

<HEADLINE> Hailing Century's Best Nonfiction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Choosing one of the most idiosyncratic of  
literary memoirs, the Modern Library pronounced ``The Education of 
Henry Adams'' this century's best English-language work of 
nonfiction. 
</P>
<P>
	William James' landmark study ``The Varieties of Religious  
Experience'' came in second on the publishing house's top 100 list. 
It was followed by Booker T. Washington's autobiography ``Up From 
Slavery,'' a founding document for the philosophy of black 
self-help. 
</P>
<P>
	The Modern Library released its top 100 on Thursday, the eve of  
BookExpo America, the industry's annual national convention. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Modern Library's top 100 fiction list was criticized  
for being overwhelmingly aging, white and male, the publisher 
expanded what had been an overwhelmingly aging, white and male 
selection committee. Two women, Elaine Pagels and Carolyn See, were 
added, as was a black author, Charles Johnson, and such younger 
writers as Jon Krakauer and Caleb Carr. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were certainly attempting to bring a more diverse set of  
titles,'' said David Ebershoff, publishing director for the Modern 
Library, a division of Random House. 
</P>
<P>
	In other efforts at more variety, no writer was permitted more  
than one title on the list and each of the 13 committee members was 
allowed to add one book of his or her choice. As with fiction, 
selections were made regardless of publisher. 
</P>
<P>
	The nonfiction top 10 included one black, Washington, and two  
women: Virginia Woolf was ranked fourth for her feminist classic 
``A Room of One's Own,'' and Rachel Carson was No. 5 for ``Silent 
Spring,'' which helped inspire the environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other black writers, James Baldwin (``Notes of a Native  
Son'') and Richard Wright (``Black Boy''), and two more women, 
Barbara Tuchman (``The Guns of August'') and Gertrude Stein (``The 
Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas''), made the top 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like they sort of learned their lesson from the  
fiction list,'' said novelist and essayist Mary Gordon. ``It sounds 
like a pretty good list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams' book, published privately in 1907, became as talked about  
for what it omitted as for what it contained. Missing was any 
reference to his wife's suicide or to such well-known earlier books 
as his political novel ``Democracy'' or his histories of the 
Jefferson and Madison administrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, referring to himself in the third person, this  
descendant of two American presidents told a melancholy, 
fascinating story of his intellectual and spiritual life. The 
dominant themes were his quest for a unified theory of history and 
his alienation from the mechanized society that emerged after the 
Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a remarkable book, an important part of American culture.  
He's lamenting a vanishing world,'' said critic and non-committee 
member Harold Bloom, who assessed the entire body of Western 
literature in his book ``The Western Canon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vladimir Nabokov, whose novel ``Lolita'' ranked No. 4 on the  
fiction list, was the only writer to make the top 10 in both 
categories. His memoir ``Speak, Memory'' was No. 8 for nonfiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the top 10 were T.S. Eliot's ``Selected Essays,  
1917-1932,'' Nobel Prize-winning scientist James D. Watson's ``The 
Double Helix,'' H.L. Mencken's ``The American Language'' and 
economist John Maynard Keynes' ``The General Theory of Employment, 
Interest, and Money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The list includes some of the century's most famous thinkers,  
rebels and political leaders, among them Winston Churchill, Albert 
Einstein, Bertrand Russell, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and 
Malcolm X. Others making it were Mark Twain, W.E.B. DuBois, Tom 
Wolfe, John Kenneth Galbraith and E.B. White, as co-author of ``The 
Elements of Style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But with only 100 getting in, there will be questions about  
those left out. Among the missing: Ernest Hemingway's ``A Moveable 
Feast,'' James Agee and Walker Evans' ``Let Us Now Praise Famous 
Men,'' Leon Edel's biography of Henry James and Betty Friedan's 
``The Feminine Mystique.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another problem was deciding what qualified as ``nonfiction.''  
Truman Capote's novelistic ``In Cold Blood'' made the list. But 
such acclaimed Norman Mailer books as ``The Armies of the Night'' 
and ``The Executioner's Song,'' which many believe equally 
``true,'' didn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some committee members did feel they didn't trust Capote and  
they didn't trust whether his book was nonfiction,'' Ebershoff 
said. ``And there were some who argued strongly for `Executioner's 
Song' to be on the list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the committee members also were on the fiction panel:  
Modern Library board chairman Christopher Cerf; English novelist 
A.S. Byatt; historians Shelby Foote, Edmund Morris, Arthur 
Schlesinger Jr. and John Richardson; and Vartan Gregorian, head of 
the Carnegie Corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	Members worked from a master list of 900 titles.

<HEADLINE> Nets' Van Horn Has Thumb Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Keith Van Horn of the New Jersey  
Nets, the NBA's sixth leading this season, had surgery on his 
broken left thumb on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A undisclosed number of surgical pins were inserted in the thumb  
by Dr. Charles Melone during the surgery, which lasted less than an 
hour, the Nets said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Horn, who was injured on Sunday in a game against Indiana,  
will have to wear a cast for 4-to-6 weeks before beginning 
rehabilitation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: No Violence Summit in D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton declined Thursday to limit  
any White House summit on youth violence to the entertainment 
industry's influence, saying the problem is much broader than 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Careful to take the issue beyond the television, motion picture  
and recording industries, where he has many friends and political 
contributors, Clinton said many factors could be contributing to 
the rash of school shootings in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	``What should we do about guns? What should we do about culture?  
What should we do about the schools? How can we help the parents? 
And, what is government's responsibility? Those are the big 
questions. We should ask and answer all of them -- not just one,'' 
Clinton said Thursday in an interview to be shown Friday on NBC's 
``Today'' show. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Congress asked Clinton earlier this week to convene  
an emergency summit of entertainment industry executives to address 
the kind of youth rage that erupted at Columbine High School in 
Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked in the NBC interview if he would convene such a summit,  
Clinton said: 
</P>
<P>
	``I plan to bring some high-level folks from the entertainment  
industry and from other sectors of our society that I think can be 
active here together at the White House in the near future and then 
figure out how we can put together the elements of a national 
campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the entertainment industry must have ``a big part'' of any  
solution to youth violence, Clinton said, he indicated he believes 
that the National Rifle Association also has a role. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a mistake for the people who don't want to offend  
the NRA to blame Hollywood and the people that don't want to offend 
Hollywood to blame the NRA,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE>  Phils Brantley Put on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Phillies closer Jeff Brantley,  
put on the disabled list Wednesday night after being forced to 
leave a game because of shoulder trouble, could be lost for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillies team physician Dr. Phillip Marone on Thursday said  
Brantley has a tear in his right shoulder. The injury could be 
connected to trouble that caused him to miss four months in 1997 
and part of the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had no problems until two weeks ago,'' Marone said. ``It's  
not totally unrelated to the old tear, but this one is a new one, 
only more extensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brantley, 35, will get a second opinion on Monday from Dr. James  
Andrews in Birmingham, Ala. Andrews operated on him in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	If surgery is needed, Brantley will miss at least four months  
and possibly the whole year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just real disheartening to work as hard as I have and  
throw as well as I was throwing and then have this happen,'' said 
Brantley, in his first season with the Phillies after an offseason 
trade with the St. Louis Cardinals. ``I'm in a new place where I 
know they need me. I feel like I'm letting them down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brantley is 1-1 and four saves with a 2.84 ERA in seven games.  
He was sidelined for 11 days earlier this season, and returned to 
get a save Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, Brantley took to start the ninth with the  
Phillies and Reds tied at 8. He walked one batter, struck out 
another, then left and was the losing pitcher in a 12-8 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia general manager Ed Wade had no immediate plans to  
replace Brantley as closer. Steve Montgomery was called up from 
Triple-A Scranton-Wilkes-Barre to take Brantley's roster spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, I'm real disappointed for him,'' Wade said. ``But, it's  
hard to go out and buy a closer. We're going to have to rely on 
guys to step into roles they're not accustomed to.''

<HEADLINE> Magnetic Strips on Mars Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Early in its history, the geology of Mars may  
have been much like that of Earth, with molten rock gurgling to the 
surface from a hot interior and with crustal plates drifting on the 
surface, according to new studies. 
</P>
<P>
	In research published today in the journal Science, a team of  
scientists report that instruments aboard the Mars Global Surveyor 
detected magnetic stripes on Mars that closely resemble the 
terrestrial markings of surface spreading and continental drift. 
</P>
<P>
	This may mean the very young Mars resembled the very young  
Earth, but that Mars ran out of its internal energy sources and 
became a geologically dead planet early in its history, said Norman 
F. Ness of the University of Delaware, co-author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``The data suggests that Mars was once magnetic and was far more  
similar to Earth's global magnetic field than had been previously 
assumed,'' Ness said. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence of this magnetic field is frozen in rocks that were  
molten when the magnetic field existed. When the rocks hardened, 
they retained the original magnetism and that now has been detected 
and mapped by the spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the present time, there is no evidence of a global magnetic  
field on Mars,'' said Ness. ``That means the dynamo died and what 
is left is the memory of that dynamo, stored in the crustal rocks 
like a magnetic tape recording.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pattern of magnetic rock closely resembles the striations  
that led scientists to discover on Earth that continents sit atop 
immense crustal plates that inch about the globe over millions of 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists previously believed that continental drift occurred  
only on Earth because studies had shown the process did not take 
place on Venus, the solar system planet nearest Earth's size, said 
Ness. 
</P>
<P>
	But the discovery of Martian magnetic striations suggests that  
planet could also have had continent-sized plates that split apart 
on the surface and inched apart, pushed by the flow of magma 
bubbling up through crustal rifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ness said the energy that heated the rock apparently ran out  
within a few hundred million years and Mars became a geologically 
dead planet. The solar system, including the Earth and Mars, are 
thought to have formed 4 billion to 4.5 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicki L. Hansen, a Southern Methodist University geologist, said  
that the fate of Mars also awaits the Earth. She said the Earth 
eventually will also exhaust its internal energy and its molten 
core will cool. This will shut down the planet's magnetic field and 
allow radiation from the sun to strip away the Earth's atmosphere 
and water. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Mars went through at a very young age is what will occur  
on the Earth eventually,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ness said Mars died much more quickly than Earth because the red  
planet is smaller and had much less internal heat generated by 
friction and the decay of radioactive minerals.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Avoids State Income Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- The Live Free or Die State found a way out  
of its school funding jam today without imposing a dreaded state 
income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature approved an $825 million school spending plan  
that relies primarily on a new, uniform, statewide property tax. 
The governor signed the legislation two hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan allows New Hampshire to maintain its status as one of  
only two states with no general income tax or sales tax. Alaska is 
the other. Eight other states have no state income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers were forced to come up with a tax plan after the New  
Hampshire Supreme Court ruled in 1997 that the state's way of 
paying for public schools is unconstitutional because it relies on 
local property taxes, which vary widely from place to place. The 
court ordered lawmakers to come up with a fairer way to pay for 
education by April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, both houses of the Legislature voted for an income  
tax last month, but Gov. Jeanne Shaheen promised to veto it, 
causing lawmakers to miss the deadline. That placed the state's 
credit rating and summer programs for disabled students in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise plan contains a statewide property tax that would  
raise $460 million. It also contains increases in business and 
cigarette taxes, a new tax on rental cars and an increase in the 
property sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we have fundamentally changed the way we support  
education in New Hampshire,'' Ms. Shaheen said. 
</P>
<P>
	About three dozen towns will pay higher school property taxes  
than they do now. But the changes will be phased in over five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-income tax sentiment in New Hampshire traditionally is  
so strong that ever governor for the past generation -- Ms. Shaheen 
included -- has taken ``The Pledge'' to veto a broad-based tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Connair, chairman of the coalition whose lawsuit led to the  
Supreme Court ruling, said he was disappointed by the solution and 
added that some plaintiffs probably will go back to court. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a watered-down hodgepodge of competing political  
interests,'' Connair said. ``It may solve the short-term, immediate 
concerns, but it doesn't solve the problem.''

<HEADLINE> ASEAN: Asian Economies Bottom Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The Association of Southeast Asian  
Nations' crisis-hit economies are all showing signs of hitting 
bottom, a senior official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Suthad Setboonsarng, ASEAN's deputy secretary-general, said an  
economic forecast by a monitoring group set up by the nine-member 
bloc shows ``we are hitting the bottom'' of the slump. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to avoid future financial crises, ASEAN agreed  
nearly two years ago to establish a joint surveillance system to 
spot problems in each others' economies before they become serious. 
</P>
<P>
	Suthad, who is in Manila for an annual meeting of the Asian  
Development Bank, said the oversight group's report, still under 
preparation, will be submitted to ASEAN finance ministers later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The surveillance system is one of the few measures ASEAN took to  
deal with the region's financial turmoil, but it was slow getting 
started. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, the Asian Development Bank said in its latest  
economic outlook that Southeast Asia's economies are expected to 
start mending this year, although the pace and strength of recovery 
will depend on the impact of reforms and the mood of world 
financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the  
Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam. Cambodia is scheduled 
to join on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, meanwhile, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong on  
Thursday reiterated the government's belief that the worst of 
Asia's economic crisis may be over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, the worst may be behind us,'' Goh said in a May  
Day message to the National Trades Union Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this bottom is not a trampoline, so these economies will  
recover slowly and painfully, rather than bounce back with vigor,'' 
Goh predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	China's economic slowdown, the uncertain pace of Japan's  
recovery and Indonesia's social and political problems are still 
``areas of anxieties,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Panel Wants Hedge Fund Disclosure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to the near-collapse of a big  
high-risk investment fund, a presidential task force is 
recommending that such hedge funds be required by law to disclose 
financial information now deemed private, according to a House 
source. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-awaited recommendations are in response to the  
near-demise last fall of Long-Term Capital Management, which sent 
shock waves through world financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	They were being made public today by the President's Working  
Group on Financial Markets, which was established after the October 
1987 stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is made up of officials from the Federal Reserve, the  
Treasury Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It has been trying to unravel 
for months the events leading to the meltdown of Connecticut-based 
Long-Term Capital, a big speculative fund for wealthy investors. 
</P>
<P>
	While hedge funds are largely unregulated, the Fed and the  
Treasury do have responsibility for the nation's banking system, 
which could be severely affected by a major hedge fund collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also is recommending that Congress give the SEC and  
the CFTC more authority to collect data on unregulated affiliates 
of securities firms that participate in hedge funds, the House 
official said Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Another recommendation is that the SEC begin requiring publicly  
traded companies, such as big banks and brokerage firms, to 
disclose any significant investments they have in hedge funds. 
</P>
<P>
	And the panel recommends that regulators require banks and  
brokerage firms to set aside more reserves to cover potential 
losses from hedge fund investments, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hedge funds would be required to disclose their financial  
data to federal regulators every three months under the white House 
panel's proposal. Currently some but not all hedge funds are 
required to file financial reports with the CFTC, but the reports 
are often out of date and kept confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	The working group, however, is not calling for direct government  
regulation of hedge funds, according to the source. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and SEC Chairman Arthur  
Levitt both have said publicly in recent months they believe that 
new government controls on hedge funds aren't needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan acknowledged recently that the Long-Term Capital  
debacle was a failure of the current system, which relies on banks 
-- rather than federal regulators -- to supervise the hedge funds to 
which they lend money. But he called it ``a single mistake ... a 
very rare event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long-Term Capital's near-collapse last September after its  
managers bet wrong on interest-rate swings threatened financial 
markets. The Federal Reserve stepped in and helped arrange a $3.6 
billion bailout by a group of major banks and brokerage firms. 
</P>
<P>
	The investors in -- and rescuers of -- Long-Term Capital included  
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter, Travelers Group, UBS Securities Inc. and several big 
European banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Parkinson, associate director of the Fed's research and  
statistics division, told lawmakers last December that banks making 
generous loans to Long-Term Capital ``didn't ask enough questions'' 
about the fund's risks and operations.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Cops Interview Gun Seller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Authorities interviewed a man who may  
have sold the semi-automatic handgun to the youths who went on a 
rampage at Columbine High School, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney David Thomas said an arrest in the case will  
be made within a day or two. He told NBC's ``Today'' show that 
authorities were discussing the man's surrender with his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, however, Thomas' spokeswoman said more  
information gathered by police had changed the timeline on an 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because this is a quickly developing and very fluid  
investigation, the way the investigation went through the night, it 
does not look like there will be an arrest in the next 48 hours,'' 
said spokeswoman Pam Russell. 
</P>
<P>
	She declined to identify the man, saying, ``They are in the  
process of interviewing or talking with the person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said the man would be charged with violating a law  
against selling handguns to minors. The sale of the semiautomatic 
TEC DC-9 was a ``private transaction,'' he said. The transaction 
was made before the older gunman turned 18 earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the seller could face accessory to murder charges,  
sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said it would depend on whether he 
knew if the killers had planned to use the gun in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, hiding their arsenal  
under black trench coats, killed 13 people and wounded 23 others at 
the school April 20 before killing themselves. They had four guns 
and left more than 50 bombs at the school and in their homes. A 
diary indicates the plot had been planned for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas did not indicate which teen was believed to have bought  
the gun or how he or they knew the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents on Tuesday  
visited the pizza shop where Harris and Klebold worked. Jefferson 
County Sheriff John Stone said investigators believed someone who 
worked at that pizza shop acted as a middleman by putting the young 
men in contact with the weapons seller. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of the Blackjack Pizza shop, Christopher Lau, wouldn't  
comment except to say, ``We are cooperating with investigators in 
every possible way and will continue to do so.'' Jason Secor, 
co-manager of the shop, said, ``I'm not sure whom they're talking 
about and I don't know what's really going on. But, it's not me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the three other guns -- two shotguns and a rifle  
-- used in the massacre were bought by Robyn Anderson, Klebold's 
girlfriend, shortly after she turned 18 last November. They 
describe her as a witness rather than a suspect in the rampage, 
because it is not illegal to provide a shotgun or a rifle to a 
minor. 
</P>
<P>
	``She did buy the long guns,'' sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis  
said. ``Did she supply the weapons to them with some idea of what 
they were planning to do with them? That's still one of the major 
things we want to find out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said at least one was bought at a gun show.  
Federal law allows 18-year-olds to buy rifles and shotguns from 
licensed dealers, but not handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeated efforts to reach Ms. Anderson at home and by phone for  
comment have been unsuccessful. Investigators say she has retained 
an attorney and has been cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson, who attended the prom with Klebold days before the  
shootings, is just one of 600-plus leads being pursued in 
Colorado's largest-ever criminal probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of those 600 could throw anybody back into the focus of  
the investigation,'' Davis said. ``We're conducting this 
investigation as if there are more suspects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners drained by a week of funerals turned today to the final  
service for the Columbine victims. Nearly 5,000 people turned out 
at a massive church in Denver to mourn Isaiah Shoels, 18, a 
football player and the only black killed in the massacre. 
Witnesses have said he was targeted because of his race. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine student Nick Foss, an 18-year-old senior who was  
slightly injured in the attack, attended with his twin brother, 
Adam, and their friend Brad Jenkins. Foss said he used to call the 
4-foot-11 Shoels ``Little Man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's smiling down on us. I know he is,'' Foss said.  
</P>
<P>
	Anguished by the bloodshed at Columbine, people across the  
country are talking about school safety, parental responsibility, 
gun control and violence in movies, music and video games. With 
Vice President Al Gore in attendance, cable network MSNBC staged a 
town meeting Wednesday night focusing on the shootings, and CNN 
planned its own tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack has also produced a disturbing series of copycat  
crimes, including Wednesday's shooting of two 17-year-old boys at a 
Taber, Alberta, high school. One of the boys died after a 
14-year-old boy walked into the school and opened fire, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, educators have increased security and at least a  
half-dozen law enforcement agencies have arrested youngsters 
accused of plotting weapons attacks at school. A number of school 
districts have banned trench coats. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same school district as Columbine, a bomb threat on  
Wednesday forced students to evacuate Pomona High School. No 
explosives were found. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wackos are coming out of the woodwork,'' said another  
sheriff's spokesman, Sgt. Jim Parr. ``A lot of sick people think 
this is something to emulate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the leads is the medical problem cited by the Marines  
Corps when it rejected Harris as a recruit just five days before 
the attack. Harris was rejected because he had been taking the 
antidepressant drug Luvox, The New York Times reported today, 
citing a Defense Department source. Luvox is often used to treat 
obsessive-compulsive disorder in children and adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they were interested in whether Harris'  
condition could be linked to the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``His acceptance or nonacceptance into the Marine Corps I don't  
think has any bearing on what happened,'' Parr said. ``But if he 
were on medication or not on medication, that would be part of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coroner's office said tests showed no drugs or alcohol in  
the bodies of the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, a federal official told The Associated Press  
that the FBI has enhanced a surveillance videotape that captured 
events in the cafeteria, where several students were wounded during 
the rampage. The tape was returned to Colorado for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Rocky Mountain News today quoted sources as saying  
the tape did not contain images of the victims being wounded, but 
showed teacher Dave Sanders shouting for students to flee, and some 
of the panicked moments that ensured. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Harris and Klebold are seen setting off explosives  
in the cafeteria and then turning guns on a large propane and 
camping fuel bomb in the kitchen that investigators believe could 
have demolished a large section of the school.

<HEADLINE> Thieves in $17M Heist Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A man who was caught on videotape  
methodically looting an armored car company vault of $17 million -- 
one of the biggest thefts of its kind in U.S. history -- was 
sentenced today to 7 1/2 years in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your honor, if I could undo what I did, I would,'' David Scott  
Ghantt said before being sentenced by U.S. District Judge Graham 
Mullen. ``I was stuck in a go-nowhere job, and I wasn't happy with 
my life. I'm sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ghantt, 29, a former Loomis truck driver and supervisor, was  
recorded in October 1997 at the company's Charlotte vault loading 
large amounts of cash into a truck. He became the target of a 
nationwide FBI manhunt and was arrested five months later near the 
Mexican island resort of Cozumel. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors charged more than 20 people in the case. All but one  
eventually pleaded guilty to charges stemming from bank larceny to 
money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $2 million is still missing.  
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Mullen sentenced Steven Chambers to 11 years and  
three months in federal prison for paying two conspirators to open 
safe deposit boxes to store the stolen money. 
</P>
<P>
	The men went on a huge spending spree with the money, buying a  
massive home, artworks, big-screen TVs, expensive cars, pickup 
trucks, minivans, two boats, six motorcycles and several tanning 
beds. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullen ordered the two men to pay more than $3.8 million apiece  
in restitution to Loomis and its insurer. Two lesser players in the 
heist were also sentenced Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Flag Burning Amendment Might Pass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Activists on both sides of Congress' perennial  
flag-burning debate predict that the fate of the amendment will 
hinge on the votes of just a few senators. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is the same 17-word proposal that would allow Congress  
to ban flag desecration and which attained far more than the 
two-thirds majority in the House in 1997. What has changed this 
year is the support for the measure in the Senate, where it fell 
three votes short of passage in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the factors changing the lineup this time are the election  
of former Ohio Gov. George Voinovich, a Republican who supports the 
constitutional amendment, to the seat vacated by retired Sen. John 
Glenn, a Democrat who opposed it. Also, North Dakota Democrats 
Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad, both of whom voted against the 
amendment in 1995, are currently undecided, their spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the amendment say it would restrict the  
constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech. Supporters say its 
worth changing the Constitution for the values the amendment 
symbolizes. 
</P>
<P>
	During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday, one  
supporter even said the amendment would be a first step toward 
healing some of the nation's ills, including the factors that led 
two teen-agers to kill 12 fellow students and a teacher at 
Columbine High School before killing themselves on April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of our cultural problems today, and yes, Littleton,  
Colo., fits into that'' are the result of ``lack of respect for 
things bigger than ourselves,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb. The 
flag, he said, ``is a symbol in itself of our values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In part because of the changing odds, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,  
sought help from an old friend and colleague: Glenn. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronaut, Korean War veteran and staunch opponent of the  
amendment told the committee the proposal would undermine some of 
the very constitutional rights the flag symbolizes. Desecrating the 
flag, Glenn said, is not a widespread practice and even if it were, 
such expression is a right guaranteed by the Constitution's freedom 
of speech clause. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would indeed be a hollow victory to protect a symbol by  
taking any chance at chipping away at the freedoms themselves,'' 
Glenn told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, he said, the legislation poorly defines desecration and  
the word ``flag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``How are you going to define that? How are we going to  
administer that?'' Glenn said. Noting that he recently saw flags 
being sold as clothing, such as bikinis and boxer shorts, he asked, 
``If they soil it, is that desecration? How about a bumper sticker 
(picturing an American flag) covered with dust?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But proponents of the legislation fired back, contending that  
protecting the flag's symbolism is important enough to amend the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a decorated Vietnam veteran who spent  
five years as a prisoner of war, told of a fellow prisoner, Mike 
Christian, who was severely beaten for hiding an American flag in 
captivity and pulling it out daily for a secret recitation of the 
pledge of allegiance. After the beating, Christian stitched red, 
white and blue pieces of cloth together so he and his fellow 
prisoners could continue the ritual that held such meaning for 
them, McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us are products of our experience in life, and that's  
my experience,'' McCain told the panel. ``American blood has been 
shed all over the world for the American flag ... and I believe it 
deserves respect.''

<HEADLINE> Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Profits Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) -- Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn announced a 17  
percent increase in first-quarter earnings Thursday, as U.S. drug 
sales soared for its top three medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmacia earned $221 million or 42 cents a share in the first  
quarter, compared to $189 million or 36 cents a share for the same 
period a year ago. Results met Wall Street forecasts, according to 
First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales climbed 12 percent to $1.77 billion from $1.59 billion a  
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmacia, which makes Xanax anti-anxiety medication and  
Nicorette smoking cessation products, has completed a massive 
turnaround in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales growth was led by the growth hormone Genotropin, and  
glaucoma medication Xalatan, both of which rose by 40 percent. The 
company's antibacterial medication Cleocin, saw sales increase 28 
percent to $91 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Detrol, a pill for bladder problems launched last year and  
heavily promoted in television ads this year, hit sales of $65 
million in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Pharmacia's top 10 drugs, including the contraceptive  
injection Depo-Provera and the colorectal cancer medication 
Camptosar, all rose at least 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's other prescription drugs, over-the-counter  
medications, animal health products and pharmaceutical chemicals -- 
which together total about 55 percent of company revenues -- posted 
a 3 percent sales increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the 1995 merger of companies in Sweden and Michigan  
that created Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, it struggled with disappointing 
profits and several phases of restructuring before turning the 
corner last fall. It has been selling off non-core businesses to 
focus on its pharmaceutical products. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmacia shares fell $1.81 1/4 to $55.50 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Bank: Asian Farm Crisis May Happen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Asia could face an agricultural  
crisis as decades of gains are wiped out by growing populations, 
environmental destruction and complacency among officials, the 
Asian Development Bank said today. 
</P>
<P>
	After rising for many years, growth in agricultural yields is  
now declining in the region despite the need to feed expanding 
populations, the Manila-based development bank said in its first 
comprehensive study of rural Asia in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Modern agricultural techniques, including new strains of seeds,  
helped Asian food production more than double since the 1960s, 
reducing overall poverty dramatically. But many poorer regions and 
disadvantaged groups did not benefit, resulting in growing 
inequalities, the ADB said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asia continues to be home to a majority of the world's poor,  
with more than 670 million rural people -- one-third of its rural 
population -- still living in abject poverty, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing high population growth, meanwhile, is putting heavy  
pressure on natural resources in rural areas, degrading them to the 
point of reducing agricultural productivity, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Asian governments often devote too few resources to  
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuts in government investment in rural areas have been  
especially severe in the countries most badly affected by Asia's 
financial crisis, the bank said. Since investments in agricultural 
infrastructure and research often have long lead times, the effects 
of these cuts could be long lasting. 
</P>
<P>
	In the hardest-hit countries, there has also been a reverse  
migration from cities back to rural areas, further increasing 
population pressures there. 
</P>
<P>
	The report noted that very little biotechnology research is  
being conducted on Asia's basic food crops, with most of the 
current research going instead to export crops. 
</P>
<P>
	The report warned that if nothing is done to relieve the  
pressures in rural areas, conditions will continue to worsen as 
more natural resources are degraded. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is even growing danger of social conflict and violence  
over the use of remaining resources, forces that could tear at the 
social fabric of many Asian societies,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	These problems are likely to be particularly severe in South  
Asia, it added. 
</P>
<P>
	The ADB recommended that Asian governments place more emphasis  
on expanding agricultural growth, while ensuring that the growth 
benefits the poor and does not harm the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	The ADB begins its three-day annual meeting in Manila on Friday.

	LONDON (AP) -- At least three American takeover firms are  
estimated to have $1 billion or more to invest in European 
companies. They operated from the United States before opening 
offices in London: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Clayton, Dubilier &AMP; Rice Ltd. bought out a German building  
materials distributor, Thyssenschultebautechnik, in 1998. It sees 
good prospects in retailing, financial services, engineering and

<P>
	-- Texas Pacific Group Europe Ltd. bought out the maker of  
Ducatti motorcycles in 1996 and invested $106 million in Guiness 
Peat Aviation PLC, an Ireland-based airline leasing company. It did 
two deals with Britain's Virgin Group, investing in a train company 
and the MGM cinema chain, and took a $30 million stake in Landis &AMP; 
Gyr Communications, a Swiss pay telephone manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Abdul-Jabbar: Lakers Underachievers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar believes the Los Angeles  
Lakers are underachievers who lack chemistry, while citing 
Shaquille O'Neal's lack of leadership and Kobe Bryant's immaturity. 
He also thinks the Lakers made a mistake in signing Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers were picked by many to win their first title in 11  
years before this season, but with the playoffs approaching, 
they've been losing with increasing regularity. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have talented, highly-paid athletes at every position and  
they're not getting it done,'' Abdul-Jabbar, a former Lakers' star, 
said. ``I don't think it's happening as a cohesive unit. (But) I 
haven't seen them practice. I don't know what's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While expressing respect for O'Neal and Bryant, Abdul-Jabbar  
thinks both have their shortcomings. In addition, Abdul-Jabbar 
didn't think the signing of Rodman would work out because it didn't 
appear the seven-time NBA rebounding champion had a sincere 
interest in playing at this stage of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar also feels it's too early to judge the coaching job  
being done by ex-teammate Kurt Rambis, and although he wouldn't say 
it, the leading scorer in NBA history appears to feel snubbed by 
the Lakers in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar, who spent 14 of his 20 seasons with the Lakers and  
helped the team win five championships during the 1980s, wants a 
coaching job, and was interviewed recently by the Washington 
Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not going to make a decision until the season's  
over,'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``Hopefully, I'll make the short list. 
(Wizards executive) Wes Unseld has been a friend. I was thankful he 
was interested enough to explore the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Charlotte coach) Paul Silas has waited 16 years. It's not  
like I'm doing worse than anybody else. You have to be patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar, 52, said interest has been expressed by other NBA  
teams as well as some college teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the Lakers had called, he replied, ``No. The Lakers  
have given plenty of guys who played for them opportunities. That's 
just the way it's worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One guy is Rambis, a teammate of Abdul-Jabbar's for seven years.  
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers haven't won an NBA championship since 1988 --  
Abdul-Jabbar's next-to-last year with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't appear they'll get there this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like they've been trying a number of different  
things,'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``It's impossible to find the people 
with the right chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know people who go to as many games as they can. They talk  
about diminished expectations. It's a jigsaw puzzle. (Lakers 
executive) Jerry West has been right about figuring it out a lot of 
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently not this time, although Abdul-Jabbar said West was in  
a tough position because Lakers owner Jerry Buss makes a lot of the 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was entirely in Jerry's hands,'' Abdul-Jabbar said of  
West, ``things might have been done differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar said his initial reaction to the signing of Rodman,  
who later was waived, was ``he would be an elixir or a poison 
pill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even his antics could not disrupt the secure team atmosphere  
that Michael Jordan engendered just being (with the Chicago 
Bulls),'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``The Lakers did not have that kind of 
stability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever happens as far as me coaching, I'll never be involved  
(with a player like Rodman). How a key element can come to practice 
without shoes and socks and late -- `I'm here' -- well, that's going 
to hurt a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar said O'Neal does a lot of good things on the court,  
but ``he's not been able to lead his team all the way either 
emotionally or statistically. He comes up short. However, no one 
can do it by themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's talented, he works hard, but there are certain things he  
hasn't learned,'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``I am not on a crusade 
against Shaq, I don't mean to belittle him. (But) it hasn't 
happened yet. Guys who can move around the pivot and can score from 
8-or-10 feet give Shaq a lot of trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar called the 20-year-old Bryant ``a great young  
talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Abdul-Jabbar added, ``He has to mature. He makes bad  
choices a lot in the games that hurt the team. That is an element 
of not playing college ball. There are times when he tries to do 
too much, whether it be going against the double-team or taking the 
38-foot 3-pointer with 20 seconds left on the clock. He's got 
talent, he just needs to make better decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the blockbuster trade in March that sent Eddie Jones and  
Elden Campbell to the Charlotte Hornets for Glen Rice and J.R. 
Reid, Abdul-Jabbar said, ``It doesn't seem like it's worked to the 
benefit of the Lakers, it hasn't improved their play. Jones was an 
excellent defensive player ...''

have given plenty of guys who played for them opportunities. That's 
just the way it's worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One guy is Rambis, a teammate of Abdul-Jabbar's for seven years.  
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers haven't won an NBA championship since 1988 --  
Abdul-Jabbar's next-to-last year with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't appear they'll get there this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like they've been trying a number of different  
things,'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``It's impossible to find the people 
with the right chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know people who go to as many games as they can. They talk  
about diminished expectations. It's a jigsaw puzzle. (Lakers 
executive) Jerry West has been right about figuring it out a lot of 
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently not this time, although Abdul-Jabbar said West was in  
a tough position because Lakers owner Jerry Buss makes a lot of the 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was entirely in Jerry's hands,'' Abdul-Jabbar said of  
West, ``things might have been done differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar said his initial reaction to the signing of Rodman,  
who later was waived, was ``he would be an elixir or a poison 
pill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even his antics could not disrupt the secure team atmosphere  
that Michael Jordan engendered just being (with the Chicago 
Bulls),'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``The Lakers did not have that kind of 
stability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever happens as far as me coaching, I'll never be involved  
(with a player like Rodman). How a key element can come to practice 
without shoes and socks and late -- `I'm here' -- well, that's going 
to hurt a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar said O'Neal does a lot of good things on the court,  
but ``he's not been able to lead his team all the way either 
emotionally or statistically. He comes up short. However, no one 
can do it by themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's talented, he works hard, but there are certain things he  
hasn't learned,'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``I am not on a crusade 
against Shaq, I don't mean to belittle him. (But) it hasn't 
happened yet. Guys who can move around the pivot and can score from 
8-or-10 feet give Shaq a lot of trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar called the 20-year-old Bryant ``a great young  
talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Abdul-Jabbar added, ``He has to mature. He makes bad  
choices a lot in the games that hurt the team. That is an element 
of not playing college ball. There are times when he tries to do 
too much, whether it be going against the double-team or taking the 
38-foot 3-pointer with 20 seconds left on the clock. He's got 
talent, he just needs to make better decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the blockbuster trade in March that sent Eddie Jones and  
Elden Campbell to the Charlotte Hornets for Glen Rice and J.R. 
Reid, Abdul-Jabbar said, ``It doesn't seem like it's worked to the 
benefit of the Lakers, it hasn't improved their play. Jones was an 
excellent defensive player ...''

<HEADLINE> Dress Codes Tighten After Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- School districts around the country are banning  
trench coats and even considering student uniforms to keep 
youngsters from smuggling weapons and to bust up cliques and create 
more conformity in the wake of the Columbine High massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids have always had different styles and fashions and fads  
that indicate rebelliousness, but when it reaches a point where it 
can also conceal weapons, then you need to address the potential 
danger,'' said Ron Stern, an elementary administrator in Granite 
City, Ill. The school board in the St. Louis suburb is considering 
a ban on trench coats. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, killed 13 people before  
committing suicide April 20 at their Littleton, Colo., school. The 
teen-agers were part of the so-called Trenchcoat Mafia and shared a 
predilection for dark ``Goth'' culture. 
</P>
<P>
	According to diary entries, their rage stemmed partly from  
feelings that they were outcasts in a high school pecking order 
dominated by athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of trench coat prohibitions -- in place already in  
Littleton; Portsmouth, N.H.; Henrietta, N.Y.; Hamblen County, 
Tenn.; and Scottsboro, Ala., for example -- consider the rule akin 
to a metal detector. Harris and Klebold were apparently able to 
smuggle in the weapons under their long black coats. 
</P>
<P>
	Other dress code measures are aimed at imposing conformity and  
reducing feelings of isolation. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has said that school uniforms or a  
``nonprovocative-dress'' rule could address ``this whole black 
trench coat deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Memphis suburb of Collierville, Tenn., Alderman Sidney  
Turnipseed has asked the county school board to consider a uniform. 
A clothing code, he said, might prevent student cliques and the 
mean-spirited singling out of kids who dress differently. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said such restrictions are misguided.  
</P>
<P>
	``Just because we have chains and spikes doesn't mean we're  
going to go shooting people,'' said Patrick Connor, a 15-year-old 
in the western Massachusetts community of Pittsfield, where city 
councilors this week narrowly defeated a bid to prohibit 
``flamboyant and excessively morbid'' dress. Connor wears a jacket 
with metal studs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dress code opponents said children will poke fun at others no  
matter what they wear, uniforms will not stop kids from forming 
cliques, and bans will do nothing to address the social isolation 
many youngsters feel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to change the behavior of children who are  
deeply enough disturbed to do something like the two shooters in 
Colorado did,'' said Marc Posner, a researcher at the Education 
Development Center in Newton. 
</P>
<P>
	Clothing restrictions could also be vulnerable to legal  
challenge, because dress is considered a form of expression. 
</P>
<P>
	Dress codes have been upheld only when schools could prove that  
the regulations addressed a specific problem, said June Arnette, 
associate director of the National School Safety Center in Westlake 
Village, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Merely pointing to the Littleton tragedy might not be a strong  
enough legal argument, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For years now, many schools have been outlawing baggy jeans,  
sneakers and headbands that are considered tied to gang culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Other communities that have discussed dress codes in light of  
the Colorado bloodbath include: 
</P>
<P>
	-- The New York state Assembly, where the Republican minority  
proposed a bill to require school dress codes. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Portsmouth, N.H., where trench coats as well as dark clothing  
associated with shock singer Marilyn Manson and the Goth movement 
are now prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
	-- And Jacksonville, Fla., where a school district advisory  
committee has recommended student uniforms. The idea had been in 
the works for months, but the Littleton tragedy boosted supporters' 
arguments.

<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Larry Walker of the Colorado Rockies hit his  
first three home runs of the season and drove in eight runs 
Wednesday night against the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker hit three-run homers in his first two at-bats against  
Jose Jimenez. After singling in the fifth, he hit a two-run homer 
off Scott Radinsky in the seventh for a 9-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	With a chance to tie the major league mark for home runs in a  
game, Walker grounded out in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker tied a team record for RBIs in a game set by Andres  
Galarraga on June 27, 1996, against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He has 
one other three-homer game, on April 5, 1997, at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker missed the first seven games of the season with a  
strained rib-cage muscle. He had his first multi-RBI game Tuesday 
with an RBI double and a sacrifice fly and entered the game with no

<HEADLINE>  Testimony Starts in Cable Car Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A witness testified today at a pilot's  
obstruction of justice trial that he brought videotapes to a jet 
before it left on a training mission that killed 20 people at an 
Italian ski area. 
</P>
<P>
	Cpl. Elijah Packman was the first witness to testify at the  
military trial of Capt. Richard Ashby, who has admitted helping 
destroy a videotape shot before the accident. Ashby, however, has 
maintained he did not intend to obstruct justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Packman testified after prosecutors announced they would not  
appeal a ruling by the judge, Col. Alvin Keller, that bars them 
from raising the issue of Ashby's silence about the videotape as 
evidence of his guilt. Keller denied a defense motion for a 
mistrial Wednesday after a prosecutor alluded to Ashby's silence in 
her opening statement, although he said the comments were improper. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's attorneys argued he had a constitutional right to remain  
silent after his jet clipped the gondola cable near Cavalese, 
Italy, on Feb. 3, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys haggled over the self-incrimination issue for several  
hours Wednesday, the day testimony was supposed to begin in Ashby's 
obstruction and conspiracy trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was acquitted in March of  
20 counts of involuntary manslaughter for the accident in which his 
EA-6B Prowler severed the gondola cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys acknowledged in opening statements that Ashby  
took the tape from the plane but only because his navigator, Capt. 
Joseph Schweitzer, asked him to. Ashby is accused of helping to 
destroy the videotape. He could receive up to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor, Lt. Col. Carol Joyce, said Ashby deliberately  
concealed evidence when he replaced the video with a blank tape. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to make his own judgment of that videotape,'' she  
said. ``He knew that after that flight, the tape would be nitpicked 
by investigators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joyce also said Ashby failed to tell authorities about the tape  
and invoked his right to silence before an Italian magistrate. 
</P>
<P>
	That statement prompted defense attorney Frank Spinner to  
complain that the government was saying that Ashby ``must be guilty 
because he elected to remain silent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby has admitted he gave the videotape to Schweitzer, 31.  
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, of Westbury, N.Y., said he threw the tape into a  
fire because he feared a frame on it of his smiling face might be 
used to vilify him and the rest of the crew in the Italian media. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and  
conspiracy to obstruct earlier this month. A jury sentenced him to 
dismissal from the service.

<HEADLINE> The Case for Higher Pay for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Wimbledon got it right in standing by its ancient policy, dating  
back beyond the Druids, of unequal pay for men's and women's 
singles champions. 
</P>
<P>
	The cigar puffing lords of the All England Club just made a  
mistake Thursday in deciding which sex deserves to be paid more. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's champ this July will get $728,000, the women's champ  
$655,200. And while it's hard to feel sorry for anyone making even 
the lesser of those sums for two weeks of whacking a tennis ball, 
there are principles involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Put aside for a moment the prosaic issue of equal pay for equal  
work, and consider only the question of popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's tennis is the story of the game these days -- and the  
major finals of the past several years. Venus and Serena Williams. 
Martina Hingis. Anna Kournikova. Steffi Graf. Monica Seles. Lindsay 
Davenport. Mary Pierce. Players with pizazz, on and off the court. 
</P>
<P>
	And the men? Well, there's Pete Sampras, a great talent who gets  
hardly anyone excited. And then there's ... who? 
</P>
<P>
	Marcelo Rios? He looks as if he's either angry or bored, and he  
plays pretty much the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Moya? Does anyone outside Spain really care about him?  
</P>
<P>
	Mark Philippoussis? Killer serve, deadly dull style.  
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Rafter, Andre Agassi, Michael Chang? Fading, fading,  
almost gone. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest are a colorless stew of ball bashers who can beat  
anyone or lose to anyone on a given day. 
</P>
<P>
	If men were paid less, at least for a few years, maybe they  
would play and act as if they cared about the sport and fans again. 
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon club chairman John Curry, in defending higher pay for  
men, said that in three surveys during the past 10 years, ``70 
percent of the people say that first and foremost the thing they 
want to watch is men's singles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe. But that's a pretty general question. Ask fans whether  
they'd rather watch a match with, say, Venus Williams, or a match 
with, say, former Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek, and the 
guess here is they'd pick Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Even English fans.  
</P>
<P>
	After Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski, the true Brit and the  
acquired one, there are no other men who have captured the passion 
of the Wimbledon fans, who ultimately pay for the prizes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, the chance to see Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg,  
and the last days of Jimmy Connors might have made the all-night 
camp-outs on the streets of Wimbledon pass more pleasantly. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowadays fans might be lucky to see the likes of Jason  
Stoltenberg and Magnus Larsson, nice guys who don't exactly light 
up a fire for anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the fans -- at least the thousands who aren't lucky enough or  
rich enough to secure Centre Court seats in advance -- still sleep 
in the streets to get past the gold-tipped, black iron gates in the 
morning. And the reason they do is that Wimbledon remains special 
to them -- the place, not the individual players. 
</P>
<P>
	And Wimbledon would not be what it is if it didn't have the  
women. The lords of the club may think that tennis is still a men's 
game, but what really makes it, or any other Grand Slam event, 
special is the gathering of the best men AND women in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Open recognizes that, and pays the women accordingly --  
dollar for dollar with the men. The Australian and French opens 
don't pay equal amounts yet, but they're a little fairer than 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	The old argument that the men deserve more because they play  
best-of-five sets while the women play best-of-three is as specious 
as ever. A match is a match, regardless of how many sets it takes. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, men's tennis might be more entertaining if the matches  
were shortened. A lot of them would be improved if they were cut 
down to the best of three tiebreaks, since all the men often do is 
smack aces and hold serve until the tiebreaks anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Extending the women's matches to best-of-five wouldn't improve  
their entertainment value or, for the most part, produce different 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	The way things stand now, fans can pretty much count on decent  
matches among the top women that last about an hour and a half. The 
men's matches, good or bad, frequently drag on for three or four 
hours. The close scores may sound exciting, but the truth is the 
tennis often is not.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Gunman's Medication Examined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Luvox, the medication Columbine High gunman Eric Harris was said  
to be taking, is an antidepressant commonly prescribed to treat 
obsessive-compulsive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug, known generically as fluvoxamine, boosts the brain's  
supply of a message-carrying chemical called serotonin and helps 
people lead normal lives without being plagued by unwanted, 
recurring thoughts and impulses. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before the attack, Harris, an 18-year-old senior, was  
rejected by the Marine Corps because he was taking Luvox, according 
to published reports. Investigators said they are interested in 
whether Harris' condition could be linked to the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Luvox requires several weeks to take effect, and remains in the  
body for several weeks after patients stop taking it. The drug can 
cause a variety of mild side effects, such as nervousness, 
dizziness and anxiety, but these are rare. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims of obsessive-compulsive behavior often feel compelled to  
perform the same task over and over, such as washing their hands or 
checking to make sure the door is locked. About 2 percent of adults 
have the disorder, and the first signs often appear in childhood.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Pushing Youth Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton today called for better  
mental health services for young people and tighter control of 
their exposure to violent images in TV shows, movies and video 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton called for those measures as part of a national  
campaign against youth violence in response to the school massacre 
in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand why any parent would be worried,'' she told  
reporters before meeting with students at junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's new strategy should also include more restrictions  
on the availability of weapons, Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of young people who for all kinds of reasons are  
alienated from their friends, their schools,'' she told eighth 
graders at Junior High 226 in Queens. ``Let's not let those 
children die in vain. Let's get ourselves organized and unified in 
a positive way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton visited the school after being invited to take part  
in a principal-for-a-day program that brings hundreds of CEOs, 
celebrities and elected officials into public schools around the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	It was her second New York visit in as many weeks as she  
considers a run for the Senate seat being vacated in 2000 by Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan. The first lady is scheduled to be back in 
the state next week -- in Buffalo on Friday and New York City again 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, her possible Senate opponent, was  
principal for a day at a school in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	Students at the school that hosted Mrs. Clinton come from  
Trinidad, India, Puerto Rico, Guyana and other countries and speak 
30 languages. In a social studies class where she spent an hour, 
one student, Rajkumar Mangra, asked the first lady her opinion of 
the bombings in Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it will eventually work. I believe it is a way of  
punishing the Milosevic regime,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, putting it in terms that the adolescents could relate to,  
she added: ``We can't let anybody put down another group of people 
because of who they are.''

<HEADLINE> Honda Halts Electric Car Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Honda's decision to stop building electric  
cars while they are still in their infancy has prompted criticism 
from government officials who decry the move as premature. 
</P>
<P>
	``This project is still taking baby steps,'' said Richard  
Varenchik, spokesman for California Air Resources Board. ``We're 
very unhappy with this. If the technology is not ready yet, you 
don't get there by stopping. You continue to refine the product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The technology was designed to help rid car exhaust from  
high-population areas and is of particular importance in 
California, which has the nation's most automobiles with 18 million 
cars. The Honda cars were introduced in May 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	While some criticized the move, it may be indicative of the auto  
industry's movement away from pure-electric cars and toward hybrids 
that use other low-emission technology such as fuel cells. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were making money on the cars it would be a different  
story, but these are not moneymakers,'' American Honda Motor Co. 
spokesman Art Garner said Thursday in Torrance, Calif. ``Given the 
current technology, we have no plans to build them in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota, General Motors, Ford, DaimlerChysler and Nissan all say  
they will continue to produce battery-powered cars, but will pursue 
the development of other technologies as a possible alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	Many automakers have focused on developing hybrid engines that  
run on fuel cells, which produce electricity through the 
low-emission chemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	Pure electric cars satisfy the state's stringent air quality  
rules, which mandate that, starting in 2003, fully 6 percent of all 
new cars sold by top automakers must be low-emission vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	California has an additional 2003 requirement that 4 percent of  
all new vehicles produce zero-emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Only electric cars, which emit no smoke at all, satisfy that  
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybrid cars, though they don't meet the 4 percent requirement,  
do produce less emissions than conventional cars and may better 
satisfy the needs of motorists, said Christopher Cedergren, an 
analyst with Nextrend, a marketing and research firm in Thousand 
Oaks, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, electric cars were just not consumer friendly,'' he  
said. ``They were too expensive to buy ... and barely got people to 
and from work. People won't pay to be inconvenienced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few electric vehicles can travel more than 75 miles before  
needing to be recharged. A battery pack adds hundreds of pounds to 
a car and costs thousands of dollars to replace. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, most manufacturers only lease the pure electric  
cars, a way to regulate new technology. Costs to lease the EVs are 
high -- the average monthly payment is about $450 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda has leased about 300 of its EV Plus cars in California and  
only a handful elsewhere in the nation, Garner said -- the Electric 
Vehicle Association of America put the number at 267 nationwide. 
The spokesman added that the company struggled to distribute them. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts have decried California's smog restrictions,  
saying technology is not advanced enough to meet them. 
</P>
<P>
	The state is ``mandating technology that isn't there yet,'' said  
Cedergren, the analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``If automakers could make a car that runs on nothing, they  
would,'' he said. ``With gasoline prices (so high), the oil 
companies are no friends to the automotive industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Keebler, the Detroit editor of Motor Trend magazine, said  
environmentalists have blindly latched on to the idea that electric 
engines are the only solution to pollution. Other alternatives like 
fuel cells might prove more practical and nearly as effective. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point is to clean the air, not make electric cars,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda is developing a prototype of a zero-emission gasoline  
engine, but it is uncertain whether it will be ready by 2003, 
Garner said.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Try To Recover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Like at most NHL arenas, organ music butchering  
popular songs from the Beatles to the Rolling Stones is a regular 
feature during Colorado Avalanche games. 
</P>
<P>
	The person in charge of the tunes might want to stay away from  
the theme from ``Jaws'' during tonight's game between the Avalanche 
and San Jose Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing with a sense of urgency, the Sharks outhustled,  
outworked and outskated Colorado in Game 3 on Wednesday to sneak 
back into their first-round playoff series with the Avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	Another victory tonight would tie the series and ensure the  
Sharks of one more game in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've still got the upper hand,'' San Jose defenseman Bill  
Houlder said. ``We've got some momentum, but momentum is only going 
to last so long -- like the first three or four minutes of the next 
game, if that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first 15 minutes of Game 3 proved critical for the Sharks as  
they killed four straight Colorado power plays and scored on their 
first man advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche went 1-for-7 on the power play and are a modest  
4-for-22 (18 percent) in the series. They have killed 15 of 18 San 
Jose power plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``You win playoff games on special teams,'' Colorado forward  
Peter Forsberg said. ``We did all right on killing penalties. Now 
we have to capitalize on the power play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Colorado discussed special teams strategy Thursday, the  
Sharks temporarily shifted their focus to human tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in somber blacks shirts and jackets, 10 Sharks players  
visited a memorial honoring the 12 students and one teacher killed 
last week at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	The players placed a 50-foot banner on a chain link fence  
surrounding the tennis courts next to the school. The banner was 
signed by fans and players during the first two games in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	It joins the thousands of flowers, cards, stuffed animals and  
various other mementoes left to remember the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea came from the organization and the players,'' Sharks  
defenseman Jeff Norton said. ``It hit home. We came here to play 
some games and they were canceled. We were just devastated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting prompted the teams to play the first two games of  
the series in San Jose, and the Avalanche managed a road sweep that 
put them in control of the series as it returned to Colorado for 
three games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put ourselves in a good position by winning two games in  
their building,'' goaltender Patrick Roy said. ``It's too bad we 
spoiled it and let one go. ... We didn't play a very good game. If 
we bring our best game, I like our chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche will have to find an answer for San Jose's newly  
formed scoring line of Owen Nolan, Mike Ricci and Marco Sturm. The 
trio combined for all four goals Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You keep tinkering until something clicks. That clicked,''  
Houlder said. ``They're on fire right now. Hopefully, they'll be on 
fire the next game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither team's scoring line was on the ice at the end of Game 3  
as both coaches sent on the enforcers, leading to four roughing 
penalties with 20 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose coach Darryl Sutter blamed Colorado for the late-game  
tiff. Avs coach Bob Hartley had an expectedly different view. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if Sutts wants to write a book over that, but it  
seems there's not much that happened there,'' Hartley said. ``No. 
1, he should explain why his fourth line was on the ice. There's no 
sense for me putting (Joe) Sakic or Forsberg out there. If Joe or 
Peter has a broken wrist, (the media) would be all over me.''

<HEADLINE> Rory Calhoun, TV's `Texan,' Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Rory Calhoun caught his first acting  
break while riding a horse, and his rugged image and handsome face 
propelled him from there. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun, the lanky lumberjack and a stalwart hero of Western  
movies and the TV series ``The Texan,'' died Wednesday at age 76. 
He had been hospitalized for 10 days with advanced stages of 
emphysema and diabetes, said his longtime friend, Paul Dean. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun often told the story of how he was discovered in 1943  
while he was horseriding in the Hollywood Hills. Alan Ladd, then a 
top star, happened to be out riding, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I met this fellow up in the hills and stopped to talk,''  
Calhoun recalled. ``He asked me if I was an actor, and I said, 
`Hell, no!' We talked some more and he asked, `How would you like 
to be in films?''' 
</P>
<P>
	His face and sturdy physique won him lesser roles in ``Something  
for the Boys,'' ``Sunday Dinner for a Soldier,'' ``The 
Bullfighters'' and other wartime films. His most important early 
role came as boxer James Corbett in ``The Great John L.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, whose real name was Francis Timothy Durgin, saw his  
career accelerate after a meeting with agent Henry Willson, who 
discovered and invented names for Rock Hudson, Tab Hunter and Troy 
Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
	He was considered ideal for such Westerns as ``Massacre River,''  
``Rogue River,'' ``Yellow Tomahawk'' and ``Four Guns to the 
Border.'' In the late '40s and early '50s, he also appeared in 
``The Red House,'' ``Ticket to Tomahawk,'' ``How to Marry a 
Millionaire,'' ``Meet Me After the Show'' and ``With a Song in My 
Heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From 1958 to 1960, Calhoun starred in a CBS television Western,  
``The Texan.'' He played Big Bill Longley, a fast gun who traveled 
from town to town helping those who were victimized by bad men. 
</P>
<P>
	In his later career, Calhoun appeared in lower budget films,  
many of them made abroad. Among the titles: ``The Treasure of 
Pancho Villa,'' ``Flight to Hong Kong,'' ``Marco Polo,'' ``The 
Colossus of Rhodes,'' ``Young Fury,'' ``Black Spurs'' and ``The 
Adventures of Marco Polo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982-87, he appeared on the CBS soap opera ``Capitol,''  
playing Judson Tyler, head of one of the two feuding families in 
the show. He also was host of reruns of ``Death Valley Days'' in 
the syndicated ``Western Star Theater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun was born in Los Angeles and grew up in Santa Cruz,  
Calif. He dropped out of high school to wander the West. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd read about Tombstone (Ariz.) and all of the bad men,'' he  
recalled. ``I was a wild kid for adventure. So I went to Tombstone, 
but I arrived 50 years too late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hired out as a bronco buster and mined silver near Reno  
before returning to Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1948, Calhoun married Latin entertainer Lita Baron, and they  
had three children. They divorced in 1970. In 1971 Calhoun married 
former journalist Susan Langley. They had a daughter before 
divorcing after five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were incomplete late Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Fall at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices fell Friday morning, affected by  
weak Japanese economic data and Sony Corp.'s recent announcement of 
falling profits. The dollar rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average shed 197.10 points, or 1.16 percent, to  
close the morning session at 16,745.14 points. The Nikkei dropped 
15.03 points, or 0.09 percent, Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar cost 119.32 yen in late morning, up 0.24 yen from its  
level of 119.08 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its 
level of 119.03 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo financial markets were closed Thursday for a national  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, sentiment among investors turned bearish  
quickly after the government released fresh data on the state of 
Japan's struggling economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Management and Coordination Agency said Japan's jobless rate  
climbed to a record high 4.8 percent in March, as corporate 
restructuring efforts forced more people out of work. The previous 
record was 4.6 percent, registered in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the agency said spending by Japanese wage earners  
last month fell 3.6 percent from the year-earlier month in real 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Sony said its net income plunged nearly 20 percent  
in the last fiscal year ended March 31 because of recession at home 
and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people want to sell, but there is nothing to sell  
into,'' said Robert Sasaki, head of the quantitative strategy group 
at Jardine Fleming Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was scarce as many investors are cautious ahead of a  
five-day holiday period in Japan starting Saturday, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many companies, as well as financial markets in Japan, will be  
closed Monday through Wednesday. The Tokyo market will reopen on 
May 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 5.97 points, or 0.44 percent, to 1,341.67 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency exchange, the dollar edged higher on technical  
factors, despite remarks from Japanese Economic Planning Agency 
chief Taichi Sakaiya that appeared to support the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	While visiting Washington, D.C., Sakaiya said late Thursday  
after a meeting with U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence 
Summers that Japan would mull measures to stimulate the economy but 
denied the government was considering a supplementary budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also awaiting developments of a Monday summit  
between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister 
Keizo Obuchi in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.90 yen, up from  
126.10 yen in New York late Thursday. The euro was quoted late 
Wednesday at 127.22 yen in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.415  
percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.465 percent, pushing its price 
up to 103.39 yen from 102.94 yen.

<HEADLINE> Mom Faces Charges in Child Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GEORGETOWN, Texas (AP) -- Child abandonment charges were filed  
today against the mother of two children found dead in a creekbed, 
although police would not say if she was a suspect in their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Tina Marie Cornelius, 22, was sought for days after the  
discovery of her children, 3-year-old Amanda Lee Miller and 
2-year-old Dominick Logan Cornelius. They were found April 19 in 
six inches of water in a creek just south of Hutto. 
</P>
<P>
	Autopsies showed the girl died of suffocation and the boy died  
from a cracked skull. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities found Ms. Cornelius on Wednesday in Corpus Christi.  
In interviews with police, Ms. Cornelius has told authorities she 
``observed Amanda and Dominick when they were injured and lying in 
the creekbed or ditch,'' according to a statement from the 
Williamson County sheriff's department. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cornelius said she ``left the children in the creekbed or  
ditch and thought they were alive when she left,'' the statement 
said. ``She indicated she did not go back to help them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cornelius remained jailed Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Have Momentum in Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Mats Sundin and the rest of Toronto's forwards  
will have to contribute more defensively if the Maple Leafs are to 
beat the Philadelphia Flyers in the NHL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	That the opinion of coach Pat Quinn going into Game 5 Friday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Goaltender Curtis Joseph has played well and the defensemen have  
been workhorses in the face of fierce forechecking, Quinn said 
Thursday. But during the second and third periods of the 5-2 
Flyers' victory Wednesday that tied the first-round series 2-2, 
``You couldn't find our forwards ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We need more from everybody,'' he said when asked specifically  
about Sundin. ``We need to be more attentive to our assignments, 
particularly without the puck. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to have our captain and a number of other people doing  
a better job in that area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Flyers drop the puck into Toronto's zone, the Leafs'  
forwards aren't getting back to help the beleaguered defensemen, 
Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The Flyers) forechecking has produced most of their scoring  
opportunities,'' he said. ``That's where they've been good all 
season, and for years, and we haven't been able to nullify it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia has outshot Toronto 134-71 in the series.  
</P>
<P>
	Don't blame defensemen Dimitri Yushkevich, Daniil Markov,  
Sylvain Cote, Chris McAllister, Tomas Kaberle or Bryan Berard. 
They've been targets for onrushing Flyers. Alexander Karpovtsev was 
out with a strained shoulder, and he's questionable for Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the hardest things for a defenseman to do is to go back  
looking in the glass and having to retrieve a puck knowing a guy is 
coming and he's going to take your body,'' said Quinn, a former NHL 
defenseman. ``Always has been. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a while, taking a pounding, as a defenseman you just  
start throwing (the puck) around the boards and that plays further 
into their hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers' strategy is ruining the Leafs' speedy transition  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Team speed doesn't count unless you're back in position to  
defend properly,'' Quinn said. ``Then you go on offense. It's not 
when you're hanging out hoping some guy finds you and puts the puck 
through five people so you can be on the other side of the defense 
and have easy access to the other end. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team speed won't come into play until we get back into  
position and have some opportunity to move the puck against their 
strong forechecking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than work on all of this in a practice, Quinn gave his  
players the day off Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting involved in shoving matches with the bigger Flyers is  
self-destructive, Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see that war is the answer,'' he said. ``War would  
play more into their hands than ours. We try to give the hits back, 
but it's not a major strength that we have. It's like the old 
paper, scissors, rock game. You have to play with what you've 
got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not convey the impression he was worried.  
</P>
<P>
	``I see ourselves as being capable of beating this ... team if  
we play the kind of game we've been trying to play all year,'' he 
said. ``This team has bounced back before and I fully expect 
they'll bounce back again.''

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Albanians in Fight or Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAZDA, Macedonia (AP) -- The flimsy green military induction  
notice begins: The fatherland is calling you. 
</P>
<P>
	But ethnic Albanians living in Serbia say the order from the  
Yugoslav army leaves them with an agonizing choice: either fight 
for the enemy or flee with their kin to squalid refugee camps in 
Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Draft orders are now circulating through ethnic Albanian areas  
of Serbia -- part of a new crackdown on enclaves previously spared 
the purges in nearby Kosovo, refugees said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	While some refugees from Serbia proper reported scenarios now  
common in Kosovo -- looting, homes burned and orders to leave -- 
others have received orders to stay and fight for Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``What choice did I have?'' said Mustafa Ismail, 34, holding the  
notice he received last week to immediately report for duty. ``I 
had to leave. How could I be in the army of my enemy?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees also feared the Yugoslav army could mobilize them  
as defenseless human shields in a possible ground war. The notices 
could, however, be a sign of desperation by Yugoslav military. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Serbian men have themselves refused to heed a general  
military call to arms last month. Thousands of others left the 
country long before the airstrikes began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismail, who served in the Yugoslav army as a cook in 1989-90,  
said tanks entered his village near Presevo, the main Albanian town 
in southern Serbia, on Sunday. After dark, he and his brother took 
their families into the mountains for an 18-hour trek to Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was leave or be killed. There was no chance I would wear  
the Serbian uniform,'' he said outside his tent in the sprawling 
Brazda refugee compounds, about 6 miles north of Skopje, 
Macedonia's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Najazi Bajrami, 27, said paramilitary forces entered the village  
of Depce and began looting homes. ``We're hunting for draft 
dodgers,'' he said they told men as they rounded them up. 
</P>
<P>
	Bajrami claimed he was severely beaten and a paramilitary  
commando cut off most of his right ear, which is now encased with 
gauze bandages. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sawed it off slowly as if it were a piece of wood,''  
Bajrami said. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees making the dangerous hike over the minefield-dotted  
hinterlands from areas in and around Presevo say few young men are 
left. Most have fled and others have been forcibly drafted, they 
claim. Officials also said land mines killed at least three 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Paula Ghedini, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for  
Refugees in Macedonia, said between 6,000 and 8,000 refugees have 
made it from Serbia. On Thursday, more than 6,000 people entered 
Macedonia -- part of a steady daily increase that suggests a Serb 
offensive in areas between Pristina and the border. 
</P>
<P>
	With camps far beyond capacity, refugees were herded onto buses  
and left sweltering for hours in the sun as officials tried to find 
a place for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Water, water, please we're suffocating,'' a woman begged from  
a bus window. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 600,000 ethnic Albanians have flooded out of Kosovo  
since NATO airstrikes began, including more than 154,000 to 
Macedonia. Nearly 65,000 are packed into six camps designed to hold 
only a third that number. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials hastily opened a seventh refugee camp, but with  
sanitation and drainage systems incomplete, there were worries of 
disease outbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're about to have a crisis on our hands,'' Ms. Ghedini said.  
``What do I mean? We already have a crisis.''

three years in prison for illegally attempting to export military 
night vision goggles to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Fadi Boutros, 37, of El Cajon, Calif., pleaded guilty in  
February to attempting to export 20 pairs of night vision goggles 
between August and November of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade with Iraq is restricted under the Arms Export Control Act  
and the International Economic Powers Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The goggles Boutros attempted to export cost approximately  
$9,000 apiece and are designed for use by U.S. military airmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Boutros was arrested in November after meeting with federal  
undercover agents in Connecticut to inspect a shipment of night 
vision goggles and to arrange for their shipment to Iraq via 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation showed Boutros was negotiating for the  
purchase of various items, including military parts and components 
for ultimate export to Iraq, officials said. Some of the parts were 
replacements for hardware destroyed in Iraq during operation Desert 
Storm.

<HEADLINE> Sale of McGwire Memorabilia Halted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Three businesses in Florida and Pennsylvania  
were barred Thursday from selling forged Mark McGwire memorabilia 
in the state and ordered to pay $37,500 in penalties and 
investigative costs to Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon sued the defendants over a  
shipment of baseball bats last July bearing forged signatures as 
the St. Louis Cardinals' first baseman was closing in his record 70 
home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants in the case were: Events Made E Z Inc. and its owner,  
Edward Zuckerman, of Boca Raton, Fla.; East Coast Collectible Inc. 
of Doylestown, Pa.; Harris Pharmacy Inc. (doing business as Sports 
Cards Etc. of Doylestown); and Harris Bogdnoff of Doylestown. 
</P>
<P>
	Bogdnoff and his business sold 125 bats bearing purported  
McGwire signatures to Zuckerman and his business, who in turn, sold 
them to Keebler Co. for use in a promotion that was later canceled, 
Nixon said. The bats carried certificates of authenticity that were 
also found to be bogus. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon went to court after McGwire complained to authorities that  
he had seen items carrying forged signatures in shops. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the defendants agreed to halt trading in such items  
and to buy back any questionable items that had been sold. The 
consent judgment approved by a judge Thursday bars the defendants 
from conducting such business in Missouri.

<HEADLINE> Harbor Porpoise Deaths Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A record number of harbor porpoises have washed  
ashore between Maine and North Carolina, and scientists so far are 
baffled by the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 162 of the small, coast-hugging porpoises have washed  
ashore, dead or dying, through mid-April. The number of strandings 
is more than triple the 51 reported for all of last year, and well 
above the record 103 deaths reported for 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an extraordinary event. We've never seen anything like  
it,'' said Stephen J. Jordan, director of Maryland's Sarbanes 
Cooperative Oxford Research Laboratory. ``This is more strandings 
in a month than we'd normally see in a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experts with the National Marine Fisheries Service, the  
Smithsonian Institution, Duke University and other organizations 
are planning a conference in June to discuss the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbor porpoises, the smallest members of the dolphin family,  
are a threatened species. Most of the East Coast population winters 
in the Carolinas, where the young are born in spring.

<HEADLINE> US Calls Japan Steel Prices Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration moved closer today  
to imposing punitive tariffs against Japan, affirming that 
producers there have illegally priced steel in U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Tariffs of up to 67 percent on hot-rolled carbon steel would  
effectively make the widely used product from Japan more expensive. 
Already, there are signs of import reductions in anticipation of 
tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling comes as lawmakers from steel-producing states and  
unionized steelworkers intensify calls for quotas on imports, which 
they blame for thousands of layoffs and bankruptcies at three U.S. 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is likely to use the threat of tariffs as  
evidence that quotas and other stronger actions are unnecessary. 
The administration fears that stronger sanctions could start a 
trade war and hurt U.S. companies that rely on foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government is considering similar tariffs against  
Brazil and Russia. A decision on Brazil has been delayed until July 
6. A ruling on Russia is due June 10, but that country may be able 
to avoid tariffs if its agreement to curb steel shipments to the 
United States is ratified by both countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Steel imports surged to record highs in 1998 in the wake of the  
Asian economic crisis, which drove down demand for steel abroad and 
forced foreign producers to seek U.S. outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department ruled in February that it had evidence  
that Japan, Russia and Brazil illegally ``dumped'' steel -- sold it 
in U.S. markets at prices below production costs or home-market 
prices. Today, the department concluded that Japan did indeed dump 
steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Tariffs would be imposed if the U.S. International Trade  
Commission, an independent fact-finding body, concludes that the 
dumping has injured or threatens to hurt domestic producers. The 
commission already has found evidence of such a threat to the U.S. 
industry and is to make a final ruling in early June. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration announced in November that any  
tariffs against Japan would be made retroactive to that month. 
Shipments of Japanese steel have been dropping since then, with the 
exception of a one-month increase in March.

<HEADLINE> Boy Bids $3M at Online Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HADDONFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- Andrew Tyler didn't actually have the  
money to buy a 1955 Ford convertible or a Van Gogh painting or an 
antique bed. Or the Viking ship replica, or the Superman comic, for 
that matter. 
</P>
<P>
	But that didn't stop the 13-year-old boy from bidding more than  
$3 million for the merchandise and other items via the Internet 
auction house eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the eighth-grader was the winning bidder on $925,012  
worth of merchandise, including the bed, a 1971 red Corvette and a 
wrestling championship belt. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Mom and Dad found out what he had been up to.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of weird that it's so open to everyone,'' the boy  
said in Thursday's Philadelphia Inquirer. ``They don't ask you for 
your credit card or any proof that you're over 18.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew's shocked parents suspended his Internet privileges after  
an auction house called last week to discuss a winning $900,000 bid 
their son made on April 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was horrified. I said, `I have no idea what you're talking  
about,''' his mother, Ingrid, said Thursday from her home in this 
Philadelphia suburb. ``I could not believe it -- until I actually 
talked to my son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tyler said she confronted Andrew and he admitted placing  
the bids. 
</P>
<P>
	``To him it was like a game,'' she said. ``He really didn't know  
this was for real. It wasn't like it was going to come true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	eBay said Andrew's account has been suspended and the sellers  
who accepted bids from Andrew have been notified of the fictitious 
offers. When someone successfully bids on something via eBay, 
payment and delivery are worked about between the winning bidder 
and the seller. 
</P>
<P>
	As for eBay's security procedures, spokesman Kevin Pursglove  
said the company has a strict policy against bidding by anyone 
under 18. But he said eBay largely works on the honor system-- it's 
up to users to report deadbeat bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	In a three-week period, Andrew bid on 13 items, including $1.2  
million for a medical office in Jacksonville, Fla., $500,000 for 
the Van Gogh, $120,000 for the first Superman comic book and 
$35,000 for a replica of a Viking ship. 
</P>
<P>
	While eight of the bids failed, Andrew had the winning bid on  
five items, including the bed that belonged to Sir John A. 
Macdonald, Canada's first prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1860s bed was put up for auction by the Internet Auction  
House in Kingston, Ontario. The bid stood at $12,000 until Andrew 
joined in. He offered $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Tyler came in with his bid and pretty much blew everything  
out of the water,'' Clayton Garrett, director of the Internet 
Auction House, told the Inquirer. Auction House said it is 
considering legal action against eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tyler said eBay should have tighter controls to prevent  
minors from bidding on the Internet site. She also had a warning 
for parents: 
</P>
<P>
	``Talk to your kids about what's real and what's not real on the  
Internet,'' she said. ``You might think you know what your kids are 
doing on the computer but unless you're standing right over them, 
you really don't.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Small Classes Improve Grades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Students in smaller classes will do better  
than their peers right through high school graduation, researchers 
on a decade-long Tennessee project said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Students in classes ranging from 13 to 17 pupils have higher  
grades, better graduation rates and are more likely to attend 
college, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In high school, these are the students taking honors English,  
advanced mathematics and foreign languages,'' said Jayne 
Boyd-Zaharias, a lead researcher on Project STAR, which studied 
11,000-plus students since the 1985-86 school year. 
</P>
<P>
	The results came amid national debate about how smaller classes  
fit into the overall improvement of schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Touting the study's results, the Clinton administration and  
Senate Democrats on Thursday called for $1.4 billion more for the 
president's plan to reduce classes to a nationwide ratio of 1 
teacher for 18 students. The six-year plan to hire 100,000 new 
teachers would cost more than $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are urging Congress to finish the job,'' said Education  
Secretary Richard W. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a $1.2 billion ``down payment'' for 30,000 teachers  
received money in a spending bill approved by Congress. But 
Republican misgivings about the Clinton proposal could hurt its 
chances this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is little point to reducing class size if we don't have  
quality teachers,'' said Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the 
House Education and Workforce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee heard Thursday from experts who differed on  
whether small-classes are the only factor in giving children a good 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to reduce class sizes can hurt teacher quality, say  
other lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	In California's push to add teachers to create smaller classes,  
schools sought waivers on what requirements teachers had to have, 
said Joe Karpinski, spokesman for the Senate Republican education 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	``That resulted in more adults in the classroom, but not  
necessarily more qualified teachers in the classroom,'' Karpinski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Senate wants to focus on the long-standing federal  
education programs set to be renewed this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has not introduced its plans for the  
programs, which include help for poor, bilingual and migrant 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Manley, a spokesman for Sen. Edward M Kennedy, D-Mass., said  
the class-size proposal could help all groups of children learn 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	The small-class study also found that minority and poor students  
were helped even more by small classes in some areas than other 
groups of children. 
</P>
<P>
	Black students in small classes were much more likely to pursue  
college, said Princeton's Alan Krueger, who tracked college 
entrance test data. Low-income students also took more SAT and ACT 
tests than their peers in larger classes. 
</P>
<P>
	But although all small-class students took more college entrance  
exams, their scores were not necessarily higher, he said. Bigger 
pools of test-takers could include students not used to taking such 
tests, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tennessee public-school students were randomly placed in  
three class-size groups: a regular-size group with 22 to 25 
students, a regular-size group with a classroom aide for the 
teacher and a small group with 13 to 17 pupils. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyd-Zaharias said the project would continue to follow the  
students, tracking rates of college attendance, future earnings, 
welfare reliance or incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 other states have class-size reduction plans like  
Tennessee's.

<HEADLINE> Thomson, MusicMatch to Collaborate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The nation's largest consumer electronic  
company plans to buy a stake in a San Diego-based firm that makes 
software for the MP3 format, which allows Internet users to 
download music of compact disc quality onto their computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomson Multimedia, which makes RCA and General Electric-brand  
electronics, will buy a 20 percent stake in MusicMatch, company 
officials said. Terms of the deal announced Wednesday were not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	MP3 technology squeezes digital audio files from the Internet,  
enabling users to playback music on their computers or on portable 
devices. While many artists embrace the technology as a way to 
reach more people, those in the music industry fear pirates will 
use it to bootleg and distribute copyrighted material on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis-based Thomson Multimedia is ranked No. 1 in the  
United States and No. 4 in Europe in consumer electronic sales. 
MusicMatch is the world's top seller of MP3 software. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomson and MusicMatch will develop software that allows  
consumers to better manage how they find, purchase and listen to 
music on the Internet, company officials said. They will also 
develop software for companies that manufacture or market portable 
digital audio devices.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Takes NATO to Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Yugoslavia asked the United  
Nations' highest judicial body today to rule that NATO's bombing 
breaches international law in a legal bid to end the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia filed World Court cases against 10 NATO allies,  
asking the court to order an immediate halt to NATO's campaign 
while the case is being considered -- a process that can take years. 
</P>
<P>
	But an international law expert described Belgrade's  
unprecedented action as a publicity stunt with little chance of 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgrade charged the United States, Britain, France, Germany,  
Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada, Portugal and Spain with 
violating their international obligation ``not to use force against 
another state,'' the court said in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
	An emergency hearing was scheduled for May 10 to discuss  
Belgrade's request for a halt to the strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said  
the United States would regard any such suit ``as an absurdity and 
an obvious effort to divert attention from the atrocities and other 
outrageous activities being perpetrated by the regime in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, France and Germany have said they do not  
recognize the court's jurisdiction unless it is identified as the 
forum for solving disputes arising from a specific treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Gill, who teaches international law at Utrecht University  
in the Netherlands, predicted the case ``will not get past first 
base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason Yugoslavia is doing this is obviously to apply  
diplomatic pressure and sow dissension in NATO,'' Gill said. 
``There is some doubt among NATO states about the legality of what 
they are doing, so something like this could cause embarrassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three Yugoslav officials filed papers with court officials early  
Thursday. All were wearing lapel pins depicting a target, which 
have become the symbol of Serb defiance to NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first time a state has filed simultaneous cases  
against 10 other countries at the court. NATO's airstrikes are 
aimed at stopping Belgrade's crackdown on ethnic Albanians in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Court has no enforcement powers and relies on states  
to comply voluntarily with its rulings. 
</P>
<P>
	Gill said even if the court were to order a halt to airstrikes,  
Yugoslavia would have to seek a U.N. Security Council resolution 
ordering compliance if the NATO allies refused to stop their 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	But that move is ``not an option,'' Gill said, because the  
United States, Britain and France are all permanent council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a public relations stunt,'' he said. ``It has  
nothing to do with international law.''

<HEADLINE> AGs Weigh In on Telecom Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- SBC Communications and Ameritech should be  
required to take steps to spur local telephone competition before 
they are permitted to merge and form the nation's largest local 
phone company, attorneys general from four states have recommended 
to federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorneys general of Indiana, Michigan, Missouri and  
Wisconsin made the recommendation in a joint filing this week to 
the Federal Communications Commission, which is reviewing the $57 
billion merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC and the companies are looking at what conditions, if  
any, might be placed on the planned merger. FCC Chairman Bill 
Kennard has raised concerns over whether the deal, as currently 
structured, would benefit consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC plans to hold a public meeting May 6 on the matter.  
</P>
<P>
	The attorneys general suggested that the FCC require SBC and  
Ameritech to open their local phone market to rivals in the 
majority of the 13 states the combined company would serve before 
being allowed to merge. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the attorneys general want the companies to  
satisfy a so-called 271 market-opening test named after a section 
of a 1996 telecommunications law that contains the provision. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC, Ameritech and other Bell companies must satisfy this test  
before they can win FCC approval to provide long-distance service 
to their local telephone customers. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC wouldn't accept this condition on merger, said spokesman  
Selim Bingol. The law's market-opening requirement and the 
companies' planned merger ``are two separate issues,'' Bingol said. 
``We don't think they should be mixed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bingol said SBC is working hard to open local phone markets to  
competitors -- a move that paves the way for rivals to sell their 
own competing local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imposing the precondition is preferable to outright rejection  
of the merger,'' the attorneys general said in their filing late 
Monday. It was made available Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC and Ameritech say the merger would be good for consumers and  
competition. But the attorneys general, consumer groups and major 
long-distance companies disagree. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 states in the proposed merger are Arkansas, California,  
Connecticut, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Illinois, 
Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves At-Home Hepatitis Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government has approved the first at-home  
test for hepatitis C, coinciding with a massive public health 
campaign against the dangerous liver virus. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 3.9 million Americans have hepatitis C, but many do  
not know that the virus silently lurks in their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Because there are now a few drugs to treat hepatitis C, doctors  
have launched campaigns for all at-risk people to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration approved Home Access Health  
Inc.'s Hepatitis C Check Wednesday night, offering the choice of an 
anonymous, at-home test instead of going to a clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	People would use a special lancet to prick a finger, put a few  
drops of blood on special paper and mail it to Home Access Health's 
laboratories. Results are available within four to 10 business 
days, and the company will offer counseling and referrals to 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	The test tells whether a person has ever been infected with  
hepatitis C, but cannot tell if that infection is currently active. 
Some people can overcome the virus without medical help, although 
85 percent develop a chronic, simmering infection that they can 
spread to others. Users of at-home tests will have to see a doctor 
to tell if they have that simmering infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Hepatitis C, which kills up to 10,000 Americans each year, is  
the most common bloodborne infection in the United States and the 
leading reason for liver transplants. Most people with chronic 
infection will suffer at least some liver damage, especially if 
they drink alcohol, and 15 percent will develop severe damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharing intravenous drug needles is the chief source of  
hepatitis C, causing 60 percent of cases. 
</P>
<P>
	But some 300,000 Americans are estimated to have been infected  
from blood transfusions before 1992. Today, the risk of getting 
hepatitis C from a transfusion is very small, because the blood 
supply is strictly tested. 
</P>
<P>
	But those tests weren't available before 1992, so the government  
last fall began a massive campaign urging anyone who had pre-1992 
transfusions to get tested. Some blood banks are offering free 
hepatitis C testing to those patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also recommends testing for anyone who ever  
injected drugs, even once as a teen-ager 20 years ago; has had sex 
with an injecting drug user; hemophiliacs who used clotting factors 
before 1987; and recipients of pre-1992 organ transplants. 
</P>
<P>
	The at-home test will be available in June, and is expected to  
cost under $70, Home Access said. It doesn't require a 
prescription. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The kit will be sold on the company's Internet site --  
www.homeaccess.com -- or by calling 1-888-888-HEPC.

<HEADLINE> Worm May Cause Frog Deformity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A mysterious ailment that causes frogs to grow  
extra, deformed legs and touched off environmental concerns may be 
the result of a tiny worm parasite, not ozone depletion or 
pesticides, new studies say. 
</P>
<P>
	Two studies to be published Friday in the journal Science  
conclude that defects found in frogs throughout in the Western 
United States may be caused by a trematode, simple parasitic 
flatworm with a complex life cycle that includes infecting the 
developing legs of tadpoles. 
</P>
<P>
	The worm infection, says Stanley K. Sessions of Hartwick College  
in Oneonta, N.Y., causes the tadpoles to grow multiple hind legs, a 
severe malformation that dooms the animal when it grows to a mature 
frog. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every single frog I have looked at with extra legs, and I have  
looked at hundreds, all have these cysts around the deformity,'' 
said Sessions, who co-authored one of the Science studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Pieter T.J. Johnson, a recent graduate of Stanford University  
now doing research at Claremont McKenna College in Southern 
California, carried Sessions' early work one step further by 
collecting trematodes from snails in four ponds where deformed 
frogs were found. Laboratory tadpoles were then infected with the 
worms. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson found that the more the trematode infections the  
tadpoles acquired, the more the legs of the adult frog were 
deformed, multiplied or missing. And he also showed that the 
deformities developed in the laboratory experiments were the same 
as those seen in the four ponds in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Blaustein, an Oregon State University ecologist who  
conducted experiments to determine if ultraviolet radiation was 
causing the widespread problem, called Johnson's work ``the best 
experimental evidence showing a cause for the limb deformation in 
amphibians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers worldwide have noted for years that many species of  
frogs are in decline, particularly in the Northern and Western 
United States, Central America and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have suspected pesticides, chemical pollution --  
particularly retinoic acid, and excess UV radiation caused by a 
thinning of the atmosphere's ozone layer. A great deal of research 
has been devoted to the issue because the sudden demise of frogs 
were considered a possible warning about an unknown environmental 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	But the studies by Johnson and Sessions show that at least some  
of the frog problems are caused by Mother Nature herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the increased deformities caused by the parasite  
could be part of a natural biological cycle. However, he said it is 
too early to hold humans blameless, saying fertilizer runoff may 
have caused an increase in a water snail that is a key host of the 
parasite. 
</P>
<P>
	The trematode has a life cycle that includes snails, tadpoles  
and frogs, and birds. A just-hatched form of the parasite is 
consumed or absorbed by a snail. The worm develops into a larvae 
that is deposited in a pond. The worm swims until it hooks onto a 
tadpole and then forms cysts in the leg buds of the developing 
amphibian. When the frog matures, its hind legs are either missing, 
multiplied or deformed. This makes the frog an easy prey for birds, 
which become the next host of the parasite. 
</P>
<P>
	Digestive juices of the bird release trematodes from their cysts  
in the frog and the worms reproduce. Trematode eggs in the bird 
feces are then deposited in a pond and the cycle starts anew. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said even though trematodes are found throughout North  
America, the parasite probably is not the single cause for a 
worldwide decline in frogs and other amphibians first noticed two 
decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is far too early to say that this is the final answer for  
the amphibian decline,'' he said. ``Something different may also be 
going on.''

<HEADLINE> PEZ-Heads Making Sweet Pilgrimage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORANGE, Conn. (AP) -- Like some sci-fi movie in which the aliens  
rendezvous with the mother ship, hundreds of people with a fondness 
for tart rectangular candies in colorful flip-top dispensers are 
flocking here from as far away as Austria and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother ship, in this case, is PEZ Candy Inc.  
</P>
<P>
	And the occasion is this weekend's first-ever gathering of PEZ  
aficionados in the town where the treats are manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention site is so close to the factory that PEZ lovers  
can smell the sugar in the air. (However, no factory tours will be 
given during the two-day gathering.) 
</P>
<P>
	``This is like Mecca for them. They'll be all over the lawn with  
telephoto lenses. They'll be with their noses up against the back 
window,'' said Scott McWhinnie, the ``Pezident'' of PEZ Candy. 
``They'll be picking through the garbage looking for old 
dispensers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Convention organizer Richard Belyski said PEZ-heads are mostly  
baby boomers trying to relive their childhood. ``Everybody 
remembers them as a kid. We're people from all walks of life, 
doctors, lawyers,'' said Belyski, 41, a police officer in Glen 
Cove, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	PEZ lovers will tell you their favorite treat is not just a  
hard, fruit-flavored candy. It's an American icon that spans 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the mystique focuses on the different character  
dispensers, from Mickey Mouse to Fred Flintstone and Spiderman to 
Kermit the Frog. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many of his brethren, Johann Patek, 42, who flew in from  
Vienna, Austria, for the convention, has so many dispensers he has 
lost count. 
</P>
<P>
	John Laspina, 45, of Middletown, N.J., admits he has spent $850  
or more for a single dispenser -- the ``psychedelic eye'' created in 
the '60s. He has five of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was a kid, between Sunday school and church, I used to  
run to fill up my PEZ,'' said Laspina, a faraway look in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	David Welch, 37, of Murphysboro, Ill., also had his first  
experience with PEZ as a child and has since become an authority, 
having written two books, ``Pictorial Guide to Plastic Candy 
Dispensers'' and the seminal work ``Collecting PEZ.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He specializes in historical dispensers. The originals look like  
cigarette lighters, which is fitting, since Austrian Eduard Haas 
invented PEZ in 1927 as a mint for smokers. The name was derived 
from the German word for peppermint, pfefferminz. 
</P>
<P>
	PEZ didn't arrive in America until 1952. About 3 billion are  
consumed annually in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A 12-PEZ pack has 35 calories and no nutritional value  
whatsoever, but McWhinnie insisted there are candies that are worse 
for you. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a lot of dental problems with PEZ. PEZ don't  
stick to your teeth. They dissolve,'' he said. ``Now, Gummi Bears, 
they are a problem.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Kosovo Plan Faces Doubters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the aftermath of stinging House votes, the  
White House is confronting deep congressional doubts over President 
Clinton's path in the Yugoslavia conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration says Slobodan Milosevic should take no  
comfort -- the airstrikes will continue despite bipartisan concerns 
on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lieutenants tried to deal with the congressional  
setback by making light of it, asserting that the House votes had 
sent such a muddled message that no one -- including Milosevic -- 
could understand it. ``If there's a clear message in them, someone 
needs to explain it to me and to speak very slowly and to use small 
words, because I don't get it,'' spokesman Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exposing sharp divisions about escalating U.S. involvement, the  
House voted 249 to 180 on Wednesday to bar funds for U.S. ground 
forces in the Balkans unless Congress first gives its approval. 
That was followed by a tie vote of 213 to 213 in which the House 
refused to support NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	In the background was Republican backing for doubling Clinton's  
request for $6 billion to pay for the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart called it ``a mixed message on all sides of this  
issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it was particularly striking that lawmakers refused to  
endorse an air war five weeks into the campaign with no end in 
sight. It was an unmistakable expression of lack of confidence in 
the policy of the commander in chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-six Democrats broke from the president to vote against  
the bombing. The Republican leadership split; Speaker Dennis 
Hastert voted to support airstrikes while House GOP Whip Tom Delay 
led most Republicans in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	If Congress is divided, so are the American people.  
</P>
<P>
	``Public opinion is so conflicted on where we go from here that  
a divided opinion about this is not too surprising,'' said pollster 
Andrew Kohut of the Pew Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public supports the basic notion that we should be doing  
something,'' Kohut said, ``but thinks that, inevitably, we're going 
to have to do more -- but doesn't necessarily support doing more. 
The public is divided on ground troops. That the Congress is 
divided on an affirmation of this may be in keeping with the 
public's conflicted views on Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vietnam war historian James Weland said the vote to limit using  
ground troops shows lawmakers are leery. ``They don't want to get 
sucked into something,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the Tonkin Gulf resolution coming back to bite,''  
Weland said in a telephone interview from Bentley College in 
Waltham, Mass. ``The Congress realizes that was a big mistake in 
retrospect. It was the functional equivalent of a declaration of 
war (in Vietnam). It authorized President Johnson to use all 
necessary means. Having given out the authority, they couldn't take 
it back in conflict. I think they learned a hard lesson on that 
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bitter impeachment battle that ended just 11 weeks ago also  
may have played a role in the House votes, hardening Republicans' 
dislike of the president and encouraging GOP votes against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also grouse that the war has given Clinton an  
uncontested stage on which to act presidential and flex his muscle 
as commander in chief, enhancing his standing as a global leader. 
After visits to Navy and Air Force bases in the United States, 
Clinton will fly to Germany next week to meet with Kosovo refugees 
and U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a residual of the impeachment debate that is  
background for almost any major decision now, whether it's the 
budget, whether it's social programs or the defense budget,'' said 
foreign policy analyst William Taylor. ``All the time it's in the 
background.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, director of political-military studies at the Center for  
Strategic and International Studies, said Wednesday's votes were 
all about politics. ``It's about the Republicans wanting to let 
this be the Clinton-Gore war 'to lose.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the resulting confusion -- and White House mishandling of  
the conflict -- have strengthened Milosevic's hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now Milosevic is in the driver's seat,'' Taylor said.  
``He's playing chess while Clinton is playing checkers. He's one 
move ahead of us every time. The House is playing checkers, too -- 
each party playing its own game.''

<HEADLINE> US Equity Firms Shedding Bad Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The U.S. investment firm that symbolized an era of  
corporate raiders and a ``greed is good'' ethos has quietly 
expanded across the Atlantic to target undervalued companies in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co. -- best known for its $25 billion  
buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1989 -- is one of several buyout firms 
hoping to cash in on the frenzy of mergers and acquisitions 
sweeping the continent. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike their unsavory 1980s image as predators, KKR and  
other leveraged buyout firms are bringing their more constructive 
1990s reputations to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	In the earlier era, these firms frequently bought companies in  
hostile takeovers, cut costs by laying off thousands of employees, 
then dismembered the businesses and sold them off piecemeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Burrough and John Helyar portrayed the period in  
``Barbarians at the Gate,'' their best-selling account of the 
takeover battle for RJR Nabisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, buyout firms have learned it is better to win over  
management and shareholders in order to maximize profits from their 
newly acquired companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's much more 'buy and build' than 'buy and break up,'''  
said John Burke, who oversees business with European buyout firms 
for Credit Suisse First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	KKR opened its doors in January, amid the gentlemen's clubs and  
custom clothing shops of London's historic St. James' area. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes sense to set up an office and have a more substantial  
presence so we can follow through on these opportunities we're 
seeing,'' says managing director Ned Gilhuly. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. firms are looking to buy shares in companies whose  
assets they believe are worth more than others have discerned. They 
sometimes buy out a publicly traded company with the goal of making 
it more efficient before selling it back to public investors at a 
higher price. 
</P>
<P>
	They can enhance their buying power by leveraging themselves, or  
borrowing heavily, often by selling high-yield ``junk'' bonds, just 
as they did in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Most American buyout firms in London have opened offices here in  
the past year or two. But they've raised an estimated $30 billion 
to finance takeovers, and their purchasing power swells to an 
impressive $120 billion when potential borrowings are included. 
</P>
<P>
	KKR is estimated to have raised at least $2 billion for  
acquisitions in Europe, and it expects to expand its professional 
staff from six to nine by the end of June. Gilhuly refused to 
describe what deals are in the works, saying only: ``We're very 
busy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another New York firm -- Clayton, Dubilier &AMP; Rice Ltd. -- opened a  
branch last summer in London's elegant Mayfair district. That same 
month, it purchased a building materials distributor based in 
Dusseldorf, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very insistent that we will only do a deal if the  
management are on board,'' managing director Christopher Mackenzie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other players is Soros Private Equity Partners, a unit of  
the fund managed by global financier George Soros. It has set up 
shop with a reported $1 billion to invest. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Pacific Group, whose founders managed money for the Bass  
family of Texas, opened its London office a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It has completed at least five deals, including buying out the  
company that makes Ducatti motorcycles and investing $30 million in 
a Swiss company that manufacturers pay telephones. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe's appeal lies in the rapid consolidation taking place  
among its companies. The adoption by 11 countries of a common 
currency, the euro, and a growing acceptance here of alternative 
sources of financing have helped speed up the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still a phenomenal number of opportunities in  
Europe, and it's growing by the day,'' said Bertil Rydevik, a 
London-based managing director for Lehman Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Opportunities vary within Europe. Analysts and investors say  
prospects are better on the continent, where strong labor unions 
and partial state ownership are no longer the powerful deterrents 
they once were to companies trying to cut costs and maximize 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain, which has gone farther in privatizing its companies, is  
more useful as a base of operations, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	However, few analysts expect Americans to dominate the private  
equity field any time soon, since European firms like Britain's 
Cinven and Doughty Hanson &AMP; Co. are leading the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been on the ground longer, they have a better network  
of contacts and they have a track record for closing 
transactions,'' said Burke of Credit Suisse First Boston.

<HEADLINE> GOP, Democrats Haggle Over Farm Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats and Republicans traded barbs today  
over a stalled emergency spending plan that includes $152 million 
for farm loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again Republicans are about to cause another disastrous  
government shutdown,'' said House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. 
``The only difference this time is Republicans have targeted this 
one to hurt farmers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Department funds are now so depleted that struggling  
farmers won't get money in time for planting season and nearly 
20,000 employees could face a 10-day furlough, Democrats claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are now at Day 62 and we are still waiting,'' said Rep.  
Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, referring to the days since the bill was 
submitted. ``Shame on us. Shame on the leadership of this 
institution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We must get farmers off of this sacrificial altar,'' declared  
Rep. Sanford Bishop, D-Ga. ``They're desperate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans countered that the blame was misdirected. Some said  
USDA had money in its budget to cover the gap until Congress acts. 
</P>
<P>
	``From our point of view this appears to be more of a management  
problem,'' said Selma Sierra, spokeswoman for Rep. Joe Skeen, 
R-N.M. and chairman of the Agriculture appropriations subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The speaker is committed to getting that farm money out as  
soon as possible,'' said John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker 
Dennis Hastert, adding that he expects action on the bill in the 
next two weeks. ``Our problem has been the administration has been 
slow in getting the requests up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agriculture money is part of a $1.3 billion supplemental  
bill that also includes hurricane aid for Central America. The 
funds were needed after low farm prices in the last year left many 
farmers struggling to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for loan programs has increased 65 percent in the last  
year, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, USDA has obligated $2.5 billion in loan assistance in  
just the first half of fiscal year 1999. That's more than the $2.2 
billion in loan assistance for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman said Thursday there was little else he could do. He  
said $30 million transferred from another agency account last month 
runs out Friday. Plus, there is the added danger of shifting funds 
without knowing when they will be replenished, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That $30 million was transferred from a salaries account,''  
Glickman said. ``It can be restored if the supplemental is passed. 
But if it's not, we will be looking at office closings and 
furloughs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Currently, we estimate that our Farm Service Agency may have  
to furlough nearly 20,000 employees for 10 days,'' Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some top Republicans said Glickman had money that could  
temporarily cover the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA has about $40 million in unused funds from last year that  
could be used, Sierra said. The agency denies having any funds that 
have not been earmarked for other programs.

<HEADLINE> Senate Won't Stop Y2K Suit Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer shutdowns were the issue, but  
political meltdown was the problem as the Senate ran into more 
trouble today with legislation to control lawsuits arising from 
Year 2000 computer breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	On a 52-47, with all Democrats voting no, the Senate rejected an  
effort to move the Y2K toward a final vote. Sixty votes are needed 
to shut off debate in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats' opposition had little to do with the computer issue;  
what they want, before allowing the bill to go forward, is a 
promise from the Republican leadership that they will get a vote 
soon on Democratic priorities, including a raise in the minimum 
wage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Y2K problem is not going away, nor is it going to be  
postponed by petty partisan procedural wrangling,'' promised Sen. 
John McCain, R-Ariz., with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the chief 
sponsor. But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the 
bill was dead until Democrats agreed to let it go forward. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill grows out of widespread concern that disruptions caused  
by the Year 2000 computer glitch will result in the worst flood of 
lawsuits in American history. 
</P>
<P>
	It gives companies 90 days to fix computers before lawsuits go  
forward, encourages mediation, puts caps on some punitive damage 
awards and limits class-action lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	But any effort to limit lawsuits is a political minefield in  
Washington, and from the beginning consumer and attorney groups 
have accused the business community of using the Y2K issue as a 
first step toward reducing their liability for faulty products. 
</P>
<P>
	A fierce lobbying campaign has had the U.S. Chamber of Commerce  
leading the proponents while Democrats saw two of their biggest 
allies, the pro-bill high tech industry and anti-bill trial 
lawyers, pulling them in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-profile Y2K issue also generated a spate of similar  
bills, with a proposal by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin 
Hatch, R-Utah, competing for floor time with that of McCain, the 
Commerce Committee chairman, and Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., 
vice chairman of the Senate's special Y2K panel. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a presidential candidate, won out and Hatch, while  
insisting that he doesn't care whose name is on the final package 
has moved into the background. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd, whose support is crucial to winning Democratic votes, has  
used that leverage to win concessions from McCain. Dodd's changes 
include making punitive damage caps apply only to individuals and 
small businesses and modifying language that would have made 
business directors and officers exempt from Y2K liability. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite those compromises, floor progress was glacial because  
Democrats, in time-honored Senate maneuvering, threatened to use 
the Y2K issue as a vehicle to bring minimum wage and other 
Democratic priorities to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans defeated, 55-44 a move by Sen. Edward Kennedy,  
D-Mass., to attach a minimum wage increase amendment to the bill, 
but only after spending most of the day in sometimes rancorous 
exchanges on and off the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Withdraw this foolishness,'' a frustrated McCain said to  
Kennedy. McCain said he had ``begged for the last four days'' for 
someone to come forward with a relevant amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said the minimum wage was a national priority that  
Republicans are going to have to face and was unapologetic about 
his tactics. ``This place is just made for that kind of guerrilla 
operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the McCain-Wyden bill survives the Senate, it must still  
be reconciled with a bill working its way through the House that 
has yet to undergo the pro-consumer changes that Wyden and Dodd 
have put in the Senate bill. 
</P>
<P>
	And the administration has said that McCain-Wyden, in its  
present form, would face a presidential veto because it ``would 
reduce the liability these defendants may face, even if they do 
nothing'' to fix computer problems. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain urged American businesses to ``take careful note of the  
administration's absolute opposition to an effort which would solve 
this very, very serious issue.'' Chamber of Commerce President Tom 
Donohue said that in the end he didn't think either President 
Clinton or Vice President Al Gore, who has long associated himself 
with high-tech causes, could support a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is a pretty savvy guy,'' Donohue said. ``He will  
think about it carefully for the simple reason that this is 
something that affects the whole nation.'' 
</P>
<P>

	SEATTLE (AP) -- Amazon.com Inc.'s stock fell as much as 12  
percent today after the Internet merchant said it expects its 
growth to slow and losses to increase as it invests heavily to 
build itself into a diversified online shopping hub. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning from Amazon.com came late Wednesday as it reported  
narrower-than-expected losses and surging sales in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com shares were down $18, or 9 percent, at $175.50 this  
morning. Earlier today it fell as low as $170.06 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based company reported a net loss of $36.4 million,  
or 23 cents a share, in the quarter ended March 31, compared with a 
net loss of $10.4 million, or 7 cents a share, in the year-ago 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter were $293.6 million, an increase of 236  
percent over sales of $87.4 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com's results topped Wall Street analysts' expectations  
for a loss of 29 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was an outstanding quarter. By just about every  
measure I track, they exceeded my expectations by a fairly 
significant margin,'' said analyst Derek Brown at Volpe Brown 
Whelan. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company also warned that operating losses will increase  
this year as the company spends more money to expand its business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have begun and will continue to build out, a significant  
distribution infrastructure,'' said Jeff Bezos, founder and chief 
executive officer of the Seattle-based company. ``This will give 
customers greater availability, faster shipping times and even 
better service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will also continue to invest in systems, people, and  
product expansion, each of which helps us better serve customers. 
For the rest of 1999, we expect to invest more heavily than we have 
in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Weinstein, an analyst at Pacific Crest Capital, said he  
was not especially worried about Amazon.com's continuing losses. 
The company has to spend heavily now to cement its presence on the 
Web and to establish itself as a leading brand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are expanding into a lot of new businesses, and all of  
the businesses they are looking at have tremendous opportunities,'' 
Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1995, Amazon.com has yet to make a profit as it  
spends freely to advertise its site and expand its offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	It is already the Internet's top seller of books, music and  
video. In recent months it has expanded into auctions, greeting 
cards and has invested in the online pharmacy drugstore.com and 
Internet pet store Pets.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Accounting for merger- and acquisition-related costs of $25.3  
million in the first-quarter, Amazon's net loss for the quarter was 
$61.7 million, or 39 cents a share.

<HEADLINE> 19 Cancer Patients Misdiagnosed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- After reviewing the results of prostate biopsies  
performed in the mid-1990s, a suburban hospital found that 19 men 
were misdiagnosed and suffered from cancer they were told they did 
not have. 
</P>
<P>
	The flawed prostate biopsy exams were performed by two  
pathologists who haven't been on the staff since 1997, Linda 
Shyavitz, president and CEO of Sturdy Memorial Hospital, said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	She would not identify the pathologists or say what they had  
been doing since leaving the hospital, although she did say no 
disciplinary action had been taken against them. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital, which admitted the mistakes last week, said it  
reviewed 279 tests and discovered that 20 biopsies on 19 patients 
had been misread. The tests were taken between 1995 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 19 patients, two died of unrelated causes, Shyavitz said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sturdy Memorial officials would not release the identities or  
health conditions of the 17 other misdiagnosed men. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital officials are reviewing 15,000 additional biopsies,  
6,000 of which were performed in search of serious diseases, 
including cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Shyavitz said she didn't know what caused the mistakes, but as a  
result of the errors, the small community hospital about 30 miles 
south of Boston has established new guidelines demanding greater 
scrutiny of biopsies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want all patients to understand we don't hide our errors,''  
Shyavitz said. ``Our concern is the patients we take care of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wife of one misdiagnosed patient, who requested that the  
family's identity and hometown be kept anonymous, said, ``We feel 
shock, anger, disbelief -- there's nothing we can do. We don't know 
what's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said her 62-year-old husband was told two weeks ago by  
Sturdy Memorial that his test had been inaccurately read. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband was told by his urologist to seek immediate  
aggressive radiation therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't clear yet how far the cancer has progressed or whether  
it can be treated by her husband's new doctors at Rhode Island 
Hospital, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the state  
Board of Registration in Medicine are looking into the misread 
biopsies. Both groups refused comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The review was triggered earlier this year after a positive test  
result for one of the patients contradicted an exam from 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests were supposed to detect malignant cells in the  
prostate, a walnut-sized organ in men located just below the 
bladder. 
</P>
<P>
	Approximately 179,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer  
nationwide every year. About 37,000 die of the disease each year, 
according to the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year survival rate in men whose cancer is detected  
early and has not spread is nearly 99 percent, said Kara Smigel, a 
spokeswoman for the National Cancer Institute. If the cancer has 
spread to bones or organs, that figure drops to 32 percent, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one recent cancer misdiagnosis case resulted in  
criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, a Wisconsin laboratory pleaded no contest to reckless  
homicide after failing to find obvious signs of cancer in Pap 
smears of two women who later died of the disease. Lawsuits against 
the lab, health maintenance organization and individuals were 
settled for a total of $9.8 million.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reservists Prepare for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KOKOMO, Ind. (AP) -- Last year, the family vacationed at Hilton  
Head and Disney World. This spring, they visited Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	But this summer, there will not be a family getaway: The father  
expects to be flying refueling missions over Kosovo as one of 
33,102 reservists called up by President Clinton to serve in the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we're trained for this and are prepared to show our  
best side, we'd just as soon stay home,'' the lieutenant colonel 
said Wednesday at Grissom Air Reserve Base, north of Kokomo. 
</P>
<P>
	Reservists from Indiana and 11 other states are preparing for  
another mission away from their families and another round of 
missed birthdays, holidays and graduations. When duty calls, these 
families, and not just their soldiers, must cope with the 
disruption and anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always stressful, but you deal with it,'' said a  
navigator with the 434th Air Refueling Wing at Grissom. ``We try 
not to concentrate on all that stuff. ... I'll have enough time to 
think about that while I'm out here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even a boom operator who said she looked forward to the mission  
knew that it carried special burdens for her relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though I'll miss my family and birthdays and maybe even  
Mother's Day, I'll try to make it all up to them,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grissom is home to one of the Air Force's largest air refueling  
units, with 22 KC-135 Stratotankers. This is the second call-up in 
the last three years; in 1995-96, hundreds of members of the 434th 
served during a NATO peacekeeping mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
	The base requested that the names of its reservists not be used  
in order to avoid identifying families who may be left alone for 
the next several months. Burglars might take advantage, base 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deployment has already caused headaches for the lieutenant  
colonel. His wife was supposed to take a trip this weekend to 
Chicago with several friends -- with no kids and no husbands. 
Instead, he said, the weekend will be spent at home, worrying. 
</P>
<P>
	Once he's called to active duty, he said his wife will shut  
herself in the house for most of the time he's gone, refusing to 
travel with the kids in his absence. 
</P>
<P>
	He expects the doldrums to be even worse for his family during  
this assignment. Although he served in Desert Storm and did a stint 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, this is the first time he'll be flying into 
an air war. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time is a little different,'' he said. ``I've done the  
best I could to let them know I'm well-trained and that's our best 
defense to get home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Maj. Kevin Ketterman, flying an air tanker bulging with some  
25,000 gallons of fuel just 20 feet above another airplane is 
practiced precision. 
</P>
<P>
	It's his job to hold the tanker in position while flying at 600  
mph as a pipe and nozzle about the diameter of a coffee cup drains 
fuel into a bomber or fighter jet flying just below. 
</P>
<P>
	None of his composure made it any easier for the TWA pilot and  
Pennsylvania Air National Guardsman to tell his three children that 
he has to go away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time that we sit down and I explain what's going to  
happen,'' he said. ``They understand that this is not a routine 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ketterman, 40, a member of the 171st Air Refueling Wing at  
Pittsburgh International Airport, said he was planning to tell his 
three children over dinner what was happening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leaving my kids is the hardest part,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Once they get notification, members of the 931st Air Refueling  
Group in Wichita, Kan., have just 24 hours to arrange their family 
affairs, leave their civilian jobs and report to McConnell Air 
Force Base for duty. 
</P>
<P>
	The whirlwind can be so traumatic that Col. Dean J. Despinoy,  
the unit's commander, has activated a special team to help families 
left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real dedication ... for the rest of the folks that will be  
staying back here at the unit is to make sure that they are doing 
everything they can to support those families,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 56.41 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed Thursday, with investors  
once again selling technology shares but buying financial issues as 
interest rates fell in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 56.41 at 10,901.86 after rising 13 points Wednesday to 
10,845.45, its second straight record high close. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite, hit hard in recent sessions on aggressive  
selling of technology issues, was down 35.85 at 2,514.52. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was down 3.28 at 1,347.63. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrials were led higher by financial stocks, which  
rose as interest rates fell. The 30-year Treasury bond yield was 
down to 5.52 percent from late Wednesday's 5.54 percent after the 
Labor Department reported that wages and benefits for American 
workers rose a moderate 0.4 percent in the first quarter, half of 
what analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-quarter gain in the department's Employment Cost Index  
followed a much larger 0.7 percent advance from October through 
December of last year. The department also reported that new claims 
for unemployment benefits declined last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks were big beneficiaries of the drop in  
bond yields. American Express was up 3 11/16 at 136 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Also advancing were economically sensitive, or cyclical, stocks  
that have been back in favor since Tuesday. Minnesota Mining and 
Manufacturing was up 1 3/16 at 85 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors continued to take profits in technology shares.  
Amazon.com was down 22 7/8 at 170 5/8. The online retailer reported late 
Wednesday a first-quarter loss of 23 cents, narrower than the 29 
cents analysts expected. However, the company expects its growth to 
slow and losses to increase as it continues to invest heavily to 
broaden its presence on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset  
Management, said that if indeed there is no inflation in the 
economy, the current advance in the shares of cyclical companies 
will be short-lived. Investors will soon gravitate back to 
so-called growth stocks, shares of companies that may not have yet 
produced strong earnings but are expected to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cyclical companies require a very robust economy with  
inflationary pressures in order to generate their earnings,'' 
Orlando said, ``whereas growth companies can make money regardless 
of the performance of the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald,  
disagreed. ``People are not buying the cyclicals because things are 
extraordinarily great now; they're buying them because the world 
economy is seen as improving in the future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks were again taking big hits as investors continued to  
take profits in that sector as well. Merck was down 1 5/8 at 69 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues were only slightly ahead of decliners,  
outrunning them by a margin of 8 to 7 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where volume came to 637.18 million shares, up slightly 
from Wednesday's pace.

<HEADLINE> Crosses Bear Names of Colo. Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Crosses bearing the names of Columbine  
High assailants Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold have joined those 
honoring their 13 victims in the bloody rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	The crosses, atop a hill near the school, have drawn a stream of  
mourners who've praised and criticized the wooden monuments to the 
gunmen. Each cross bears a name and photograph, and flowers 
surround them. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows for sure who erected the two new crosses.  
</P>
<P>
	``We allowed all this horrible violence on TV and the movies,''  
said Jean Carney, 79, of Denver. On Klebold's cross, he wrote, 
``May God have mercy on your soul, Sorry we all failed you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole society failed them,'' Carney said. ``I'm glad to  
see they put something up for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On both Harris' and Klebold's crosses, someone wrote ``Hate  
breeds hate'' and ``I forgive you.'' On Klebold's cross was a 
simple question: ``Why?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erecting crosses for the killers ``says a lot about this  
community,'' said Sharon Dunn, 45, of Littleton. ``The community is 
willing to embrace these individuals. We are all affected. It's 
going to affect so many people, and there isn't a hatred held 
against anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some were angered.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's right to have the killers up here with the  
victims,'' said Anna Whitcomb, 21, of Denver. ``People come here to 
mourn and to pay respect to the innocent victims. Dylan and Eric 
were not the innocent.''

<HEADLINE> Panel OKs Anti-Flag-Burn Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate panel today approved a proposed  
constitutional amendment that would allow Congress to ban flag 
burning. The proposal is given a good chance of becoming law. 
</P>
<P>
	By 11-7, the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended Senate  
approval of the 17-word amendment that attained far more than the 
two-thirds majority required in the House in 1997. What has changed 
this year is the support for the measure in the Senate, where it 
fell three votes short in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Approval by two-thirds in both the House and Senate and  
ratification by three-fourths of the states would add the provision 
to the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott earlier this month put the  
amendment on his legislative priority list, and several Republican 
senators said they expect the issue to come to the floor for a vote 
before Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the factors changing the lineup this time are the election  
of former Ohio Gov. George Voinovich, a Republican who supports the 
constitutional amendment, to the seat vacated by retired Sen. John 
Glenn, a Democrat who opposed it. Also, North Dakota Democrats 
Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad, both of whom voted against the 
amendment in 1995, are currently undecided, their spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the amendment say it would restrict the  
constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech. Supporters say its 
worth changing the Constitution for the values the amendment 
symbolizes. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate in the Senate crosses party lines. Sen. John Chafee,  
R-R.I., for example, chided supporters of the measure on Wednesday 
by telling the Judiciary Committee that ``We cannot mandate respect 
and pride in the flag.'' He said the amendment is an overreaction 
to a rare practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told the committee  
today that she supports the amendment because the flag ``is a 
monument in fabric that hangs as a symbol of our nation'' and its 
values. 
</P>
<P>
	During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday, one  
supporter even said the amendment would be a first step toward 
healing some of the nation's ills, including the factors that led 
two teen-agers to kill 12 fellow students and a teacher at 
Columbine High School before killing themselves on April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of our cultural problems today, and yes, Littleton,  
Colo., fits into that'' are the result of ``lack of respect for 
things bigger than ourselves,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb. The 
flag, he said, ``is a symbol in itself of our values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In part because of the changing odds, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,  
sought help from an old friend and colleague: Glenn. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronaut, Korean War veteran and staunch opponent of the  
amendment told the committee the proposal would undermine some of 
the very constitutional rights the flag symbolizes. Desecrating the 
flag, Glenn said, is not a widespread practice and even if it were, 
such expression is a right guaranteed by the Constitution's freedom 
of speech clause. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would indeed be a hollow victory to protect a symbol by  
taking any chance at chipping away at the freedoms themselves,'' 
Glenn told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, he said, the legislation poorly defines desecration and  
the word ``flag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``How are you going to define that? How are we going to  
administer that?'' Glenn said. Noting that he recently saw flags 
being sold as clothing, such as bikinis and boxer shorts, he asked, 
``If they soil it, is that desecration? How about a bumper sticker 
(picturing an American flag) covered with dust?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But proponents of the legislation fired back, contending that  
protecting the flag's symbolism is important enough to amend the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a decorated Vietnam veteran who spent  
five years as a prisoner of war, told of a fellow prisoner, Mike 
Christian, who was severely beaten for hiding an American flag in 
captivity and pulling it out daily for a secret recitation of the 
pledge of allegiance. After the beating, Christian stitched red, 
white and blue pieces of cloth together so he and his fellow 
prisoners could continue the ritual that held such meaning for 
them, McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us are products of our experience in life, and that's  
my experience,'' McCain told the panel. ``American blood has been 
shed all over the world for the American flag ... and I believe it 
deserves respect.''

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Laying to rest the ghosts of one of the  
bloodiest chapters in Colombia's recent history, President Andres 
Pastrana inaugurated a new national justice building Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Palace of Justice, a modernist sandstone monolith on  
downtown Bolivar Plaza, is located on the site of a previous 
building destroyed 13 years ago in a disastrous takeover attempt by 
leftist rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	On the morning of Nov. 6, 1985, more than 30 rebels from the  
April 19 Movement, or M-19, overran the building, taking occupants 
hostage. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels called for then-President Belisario Betancur to face  
a public trial. But after an assault by government troops, the 
palace caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Trapped between the flames and the cross fire, more than 100  
people died, including 11 Supreme Court magistrates and all the 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	The M-19 signed a peace accord in 1991 and is a political party.  
However, three major rebel groups are still fighting the 
government.

<P>
	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- An appeals court has absolved three men  
who were convicted in the 1993 murder of a prominent politician and 
publisher. 
</P>
<P>
	The court in its ruling Wednesday cited a lack of evidence and  
overturned the 1997 conviction of the men for the killing of Jorge 
Carpio Nicolle. One of the men had been sentenced to 30 years and 
the others to 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Carpio Nicolle, cousin of former President Ramiro de Leon Carpio  
and a two-time presidential candidate, was shot to death in an 
ambush July 3, 1993. Also killed were two officials with Carpio's 
National Center Union Party and a driver-bodyguard.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil plans to auction off rights  
to 27 sites for oil and gas exploration in June, and the sale has 
attracted interest from 50 international companies, a top official 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the world's big oil companies have shown an interest,''  
said David Zylbersztajn, president of the Brazilian National Oil 
Agency, or ANP, which regulates the industry. He did not name the 
companies but said 18 were from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In the June 15-16 auction, firms will bid for the right to nine  
years of exploration and then, if successful, 30 years of 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	Each bidding company will have to invest a minimum of $1.2  
billion to qualify for rights to the sites, said Zylbersztajn. The 
exploration will create an estimated 2,000 jobs.

	``He's smiling down on us. I know he is,'' said Shoels' friend,  
Nick Foss, an 18-year-old Columbine senior who was slightly injured 
in the attack. Foss and his twin, Adam, were among nearly 5,000 
people who gathered at Heritage Christian Center for the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoels was to be buried in his graduation cap, intended for a  
ceremony he did not live to celebrate. With his funeral, Columbine 
High's survivors buried their final fallen classmate, capping a 
week of mourning the 13 victims of the shooting that tore their 
school, and their community, apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the last piece. Now the healing begins,'' said the  
Rev. Larry Russell, the center's executive pastor. ``I don't think 
the healing could begin until today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shoels was the only black student slain by Dylan Klebold and  
Eric Harris in the April 20 massacre and an accomplished athlete -- 
two strikes against him when it came to Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold, his father says. Some witnesses said the gunmen -- who 
committed suicide at the end of their rampage -- targeted Shoels 
because of his race. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, funerals were held for Steve Curnow, 14, and  
fellow Columbine student John Tomlin, 16, the latter funeral 900 
miles away in Waterford, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	In an autobiography he compiled for a recent class assignment,  
young Curnow described ``Me in a Nutshell'' -- a blond kid who loved 
soccer, knew all the lines from ``Star Wars,'' dreamed of flying 
F-16s and frequented Angie's restaurant ``because they make a great 
pizza.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not a morning person, and I hate to get up in the  
morning. ... I would either like to go to college or go into the 
Air Force or Navy,'' Curnow wrote in the life story distributed at 
his funeral, attended by more than 1,000 people, including Gov. 
Bill Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	Curnow's 20-year-old sister, Nancy, told of the empty spot his  
death created in her life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I don't have anybody to have fights with over who ...  
fills the ice cube tray or brings in the groceries,'' she said. 
``Now I can't tease you about your first girlfriend or even when 
you start to shave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Billy Epperhart, presiding over his fourth Columbine  
funeral in a week, acknowledged the personal toll. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never even come close to seeing this grief in the eyes  
and lives of the families of these teen-agers who were so full of 
life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Epperhart read a statement from Curnow's mother, Sue, who told  
of how, as a toddler, the boy who would suck on his blanket so hard 
that he left holes in the fabric. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you,'' Mrs. Curnow wrote, ``for that special moment two  
weeks ago when you told me, `Mom, I'll bet there aren't many guys 
who talk and discuss things like we do. Anytime you want to discuss 
anything, I'd like to be there.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomlin, a shy, religious boy who adored his Chevy truck, was  
buried in his native Wisconsin. He was remembered by 450 people and 
buried in a casket of green and gold -- the colors of his beloved 
Green Bay Packers, who sent flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	His girlfriend, Michelle Oetter, 17, said she wasn't angry at  
Harris and Klebold 
</P>
<P>
	``John's gone, and we have to take it and trust that God brings  
good out of it,'' she said. ``There's nothing that we can 
accomplish by getting angry at those guys. Anger is what started 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the service began, Tomlin's grandmother, Elizabeth,  
placed her hands on the coffin and cried silently. ``He is a kid 
that every parent and grandparent wishes they had,'' she said. ``He 
was always there for you.''

<HEADLINE> Legs Severed in New York Subway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A man's legs were severed after he was shoved in  
front of a subway train by a homeless man during the evening rush 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Edgar Rivera, a 46-year-old father of three, was standing on the  
platform at 51st Street and Lexington Avenue when Julio Perez, 43, 
pushed him onto the tracks, seconds before the train entered the 
station Wednesday evening, police said. The two did not know each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons were unable to reattach Rivera's legs, Bellevue  
Hospital spokeswoman Eleanor Hyman said. She said Rivera's 
condition had improved slightly overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, riders shook their heads at the news and some said  
they would be more cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to admit I'm hugging this pole a little tighter  
today,'' said Dawn Rojas, who stood with one arm firmly attached to 
a pole in the middle of the platform. ``It's every rider's worst 
nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agnes Torres stood with her back against the subway wall, a  
frequent habit. ``I see people standing up close past the yellow 
line and I want to yell at them, `Don't do that!' But it's really 
not my business, is it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commuters like Lynda Warner, however, were less concerned.  
Standing near the edge of the platform she shrugged, ``Look, what 
am I going to do? I have to take the subway. My policy is: I just 
don't think about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Perez had been acting strangely just before the  
attack, and allegedly punched a wall after a passenger asked him to 
move away. 
</P>
<P>
	Within seconds, they said, Perez pushed Rivera into the train's  
path. Witnesses said Rivera yelled, ``Oh my God!'' as he lost his 
balance and fell. Two cars of the train passed over him. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers held Perez until police arrived. The suspect was  
arrested, questioned and charged with attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire Capt. Fred Ill, one of the first rescuers on the scene,  
said it took three men to pull Rivera from between the cars and up 
to the platform. 
</P>
<P>
	``His eyes were aware, but I think he was really in shock,'' Ill  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Kendra Webdale was killed when she was shoved in  
front of a subway train. Andrew Goldstein, who said ``ghosts'' 
inhabit and control his body, was charged with her murder.

<HEADLINE> Longtime Atlanta AP Supervisor Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Michael E. Barron, a supervising editor in the  
Atlanta bureau of The Associated Press for four decades, died of 
cancer Wednesday. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Barron had been in charge of the AP's report for afternoon  
newspapers in Georgia since the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Diagnosed with bone marrow cancer last summer, Barron continued  
to work until last week, when he was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Barron, a Valdosta native and graduate of Emory University,  
joined the AP in 1960 after two years as a reporter at The Valdosta 
Daily Times. Earlier, he worked as an editor at The Atlanta 
Constitution for two years, interrupted by six months active duty 
in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his AP career, Barron worked as Atlanta sports editor,  
covering, among other things, the Masters golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Golf was Barron's love, and in 1978 he wrote a first-person  
story about playing the Old Course at St. Andrews, Scotland. He 
worked the overnight shift in part because it allowed him to play 
18 holes nearly every day. 
</P>
<P>
	Barron was involved in countless national stories, from the  
civil rights movement to the Atlanta child slayings of the early 
1980s to the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by two aunts, Ruth Barron of College Park and  
Penelope McCroan of Atlanta, and several cousins. His funeral is 
Saturday in Decatur.

<HEADLINE> Two Adults Shot Near D.C. School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two people were shot today near an elementary  
school in the nation's capital and one of the victims briefly ran 
into the school, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	No children were harmed, said Capt. Alan Dreher.  
</P>
<P>
	The shootings, in which two men and possibly a third received  
minor injuries, occurred about a block from J.O. Wilson Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no danger to any of the kids,'' Dreher said.  
</P>
<P>
	School officials kept the 512 students inside the building  
briefly after classes, and parents gathered outside as police 
blocked the streets. Police slowly let children out of the school 
as relatives picked them up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pitiful it's happening around schools,'' said Timothy  
McKnight, who was picking up two nieces, ages 6 and 8, and a 
5-year-old nephew. 
</P>
<P>
	One person was shot in the arm and the other in the ankle,  
police said. They were taken to area hospitals. Police also were 
investigating whether a third man who showed up at a hospital was 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Anthony Williams had been scheduled to make an appearance  
today at an after-school program, but had not yet arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Three bomb threats had been called into the city's schools  
earlier today, said school district spokeswoman Denise Tann. 
Earlier this week, a string of bomb threats forced the evacuation 
of the city's high schools on Monday and most schools on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Report Blames Velcro in Jet Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Military investigators today blamed the  
crash of a $10.2 million Massachusetts National Guard fighter jet 
on a worn strip of Velcro that failed to hold a cockpit box in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	An Air Force report on the Jan. 20 crash said the console box,  
which holds night vision goggles, broke loose and fell near the 
jet's throttles after the pilot bumped the box with his elbow. When 
the pilot tried to nudge the box out of the way, its strap snagged 
a switch that disconnected the jet's hydraulic power, sending his 
A-10 into a nose dive. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot, Capt. Ronald Halley, parachuted to safety before the  
jet crashed in the woods 44 miles from Syracuse. No one was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Goggle cases have fallen at least twice before inside cramped  
A-10 cockpits and snagged the same hydraulic switch, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If bumped or pushed, the case can become loose in the cockpit  
and present a major distraction or hazard,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Karen Platt of Barnes Air National Guard Base, where the  
jet was based, said the military is looking at correcting the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Halley, who was wearing night goggles during the mission,  
responded correctly and will not be disciplined, Platt said.

<HEADLINE> Honda Stops Electric Car Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- American Honda Motor Co. has stopped  
production of its EV Plus, becoming the first major automaker to 
give up marketing efforts for costly battery-powered electric cars, 
the Los Angeles Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending millions to develop the battery technology, Honda  
is instead focusing on other low-emission technologies, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're highly disappointed in Honda,'' said Tom Cackette, the  
California Air Resources Board chief deputy director. ``We are 
concerned that this violates their agreement with the board to 
continue to produce battery-electric vehicles if customer demand 
warrants it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cackette said the board intends to investigate. Honda officials  
say they have fulfilled the company's obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The program has met both the letter and the spirit of the  
agreement,'' said spokesman Art Garner. ``Our commitment was to 
lease 300 electric vehicles over three years, and we've done 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California air-quality rules mandate that starting in 2003, up  
to 10 percent of all new cars sold by the top seven auto makers 
must be zero-emission vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda's decision to stop marketing the battery-powered cars  
``sends a lot of signals,'' said Thad Malesh, alternate-fuel 
specialist at J.D. Power &AMP; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're certainly being more honest than anyone else about  
electrics,'' he said. ``These vehicles are just not acceptable to 
consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few electric vehicles can travel more than 75 miles before  
needing to be recharged. A battery pack adds hundreds of pounds to 
a car and costs thousands of dollars to replace. Costs to lease the 
EVs are high -- the average lease is about $450 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota, General Motors, Ford, DaimlerChysler and Nissan all say  
they will continue to produce battery-powered cars and will also 
continue to develop other low-emission technologies.

<HEADLINE> Police Link Girlfriend to 3 Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- An 18-year-old student who authorities  
say bought three of the four guns used in the Columbine High School 
massacre may face more questioning as investigators chase a wider 
conspiracy beyond Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have said that Robyn Anderson, Klebold's girlfriend,  
is not a suspect but a witness to the April 20 rampage. Twelve 
students and a teacher were killed before student assailants 
Klebold and Harris shot themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson, who attended the prom with Klebold days before the  
shootings, is just one of 600-plus leads being pursued in 
Colorado's largest-ever criminal probe. Detectives said they had 
``high hopes'' for future arrests, though no one has been formally 
labeled a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of those 600 could throw anybody back into the focus of  
the investigation,'' Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Steve 
Davis said. ``We're conducting this investigation as if there are 
more suspects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners drained by a week of funerals turned today to the final  
service for the Columbine victims. Witnesses say the gunmen killed 
Isaiah Shoels, 18, because he was black. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, hiding their arsenal under black  
trench coats, also wounded 23 people and left more than 50 bombs at 
the school and in their homes. Diaries show the plot had been 
planned for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, authorities confirmed that Ms. Anderson bought two  
shotguns and a rifle last fall. A semiautomatic TEC DC-9 handgun 
used in the attack has not yet been traced. 
</P>
<P>
	``She did buy the long guns,'' Davis said. ``Did she supply the  
weapons to them with some idea of what they were planning to do 
with them? That's still one of the major things we want to find 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Ms. Anderson bought the shotguns and rifle  
after her 18th birthday in November. Investigators said at least 
one was bought at a gun show. Federal law allows persons 18 years 
of age to buy rifles and shotguns, but not handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeated efforts to reach Ms. Anderson at home and by phone for  
comment have been unsuccessful. Investigators say she has retained 
an attorney and has been cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
	Anguished by the bloodshed at Columbine, people across the  
country are talking about school safety, parental responsibility, 
gun control and violence in movies, music and video games. With 
Vice President Al Gore in attendance, cable network MSNBC staged a 
town meeting Wednesday night focusing on the shootings, and CNN 
planned its own tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack has also produced a disturbing series of copycat  
crimes, including Wednesday's shooting of two 17-year-old boys at a 
Taber, Alberta, high school. One of the boys died after a 
14-year-old boy walked into the school and opened fire, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, educators have increased security and at least a  
half-dozen law enforcement agencies have arrested kids accused of 
plotting weapons attacks at school. A number of school districts 
have banned trench coats. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same school district as Columbine, a phony bomb threat on  
Wednesday forced students to evacuate Pomona High School. No 
explosives were found. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wackos are coming out of the woodwork,'' said another  
sheriff's spokesman, Sgt. Jim Parr. ``A lot of sick people think 
this is something to emulate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the leads is the medical problem cited by the Marines  
Corps when it rejected Harris as a recruit just five days before 
the attack. Harris was rejected because he had been taking the 
antidepressant drug Luvox, The New York Times reported today, 
citing a Defense Department source. Luvox is often used to treat 
obsessive-compulsive disorder in children and adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they were interested in whether Harris'  
condition could be linked to the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``His acceptance or nonacceptance into the Marine Corps I don't  
think has any bearing on what happened,'' Parr said. ``But if he 
were on medication or not on medication, that would be part of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coroner's office said tests showed no drugs or alcohol in  
the bodies of the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, a federal official told The Associated Press  
that the FBI has enhanced a surveillance videotape that captured 
events in the cafeteria, where several students were wounded during 
the rampage. The tape was returned to Colorado for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, families buried more victims of the massacre.  
</P>
<P>
	One thousand people gathered at Trinity Christian Center to  
remember Steven Curnow, a 14-year-old who dreamed of becoming a 
Navy fighter pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	In Waterford, Wis., 450 people gathered at United Methodist  
Church to bury John Tomlin, 16, in a green-and-gold casket -- the 
colors of his beloved Green Bay Packers. His family moved to 
Colorado four years ago from Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jefferson County school system plans to hold a memorial on  
Sunday, one week after 70,000 mourners remembered the Columbine 
victims at an outdoor ceremony attended by Gore.

<HEADLINE> Drunken Driving Crackdown Working </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The proportion of traffic deaths blamed on  
alcohol use has fallen from 57 percent to 39 percent since the 
states started cracking down on drunken driving in the early 1980s, 
according to a government-sponsored study released Wednesday 
</P>
<P>
	The study released by the National Highway Traffic Safety  
Administration covers the period 1982 through 1997. Those dates are 
bookends from the year when federal accident reports started 
recording alcohol involvement to the year for which the most 
current accident data are available. 
</P>
<P>
	Over that same span, the percentage of the United States  
population living under a .10 blood-alcohol drunken driving limit 
has increased from 32 percent to 98 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the percentage covered by laws allowing for license  
revocations has increased from 6 percent to 78 percent. Also, the 
percentage of the population covered by the lower .08 blood-alcohol 
limited increased from none to 28 percent during that period. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen states currently have a .08 drunken driving limit, while  
40 states have laws allowing administrative license revocation. 
Another study released by NHTSA on Wednesday said that if all 50 
states adopted the two laws, it would save 925 lives a year. 
</P>
<P>
	While other studies have shown that the laws were effective in  
reducing drunken driving, NHTSA said its study was the most 
comprehensive look at the laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Fatal accident reporting data from all 50 states and the  
District of Columbia was examined for the 16-year time period. The 
study controlled for the effects of trends in demographic, 
economic, alcohol consumption and seasonal factors, as well as for 
an increase in the number of states with safety belt use laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``The attribution of savings to any single law should be made  
with caution since each new law builds to some extent on existing 
legislation and on other ongoing trends and activities,'' wrote the 
study's authors, Robert B. Voas and A. Scott Tippetts of the 
Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation of Bethesda, Md.

	House Panel OKs $12.9B for Military  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Democrats and Republicans sparred over the  
scope of the conflict in Yugoslavia today, a House committee voted 
to approve a $12.9 billion measure to pay for it, doubling 
President Clinton's request. The spending package to cover the 
fighting and buttress Pentagon needs around the globe was approved 
by voice vote by the House Appropriations Committee. House floor 
debate is expected next week. Separately, Defense Secretary William 
Cohen said he is sending 10 more Air Force B-52 bombers to the

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Russia pushed a peace plan for  
Yugoslavia today as NATO sought to explain how another of its 
missiles went astray, damaging a house near the capital of Western 
ally Bulgaria. The Rev. Jesse Jackson arrived in Belgrade on a 
mission to win freedom for three U.S. POWs held by Yugoslavia. 
NATO, meanwhile, continued its air assault on Yugoslav targets, 
striking during daylight in Kosovo and at bridges leading into the 
province. Heavy explosions and intense anti-aircraft fire were 
reported this afternoon near an oil refinery northwest of Belgrade.

	Clues Sought in Colo. Shooting  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Investigators are interviewing a man who  
may have supplied the semiautomatic pistol used by the Columbine 
High School gunmen. Crime lab technicians are conducting ballistics 
tests to determine which guns fired the ammunition that killed each 
of the 13 victims. If it turns out that bullets fired by the 
paramilitary-style TEC DC-9 did not hit anyone, the gun seller may 
only face charges of illegal gun peddling rather than being 
implicated in the murders. Meanwhile, the final Columbine victim to 
be buried, Isaiah Shoels, 18, was remembered today at a funeral in 
Denver that drew more than 5,000 mourners.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton called today for better

their exposure to violent images on TV, the movies and video games. 
Mrs. Clinton called for those measures as part of a national 
campaign against youth violence in response to the school massacre 
in Littleton, Colo. The nation's new strategy should also include 
more restrictions on the availability of weapons, Mrs. Clinton 
said.

	Small Classes Said To Improve Grades  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Students in smaller classes do better than  
their peers right through high school graduation, researchers on a 
decade-long Tennessee project said today. Students in classes 
ranging from 13 to 17 pupils have higher grades, better graduation 
rates and are more likely to attend college, researchers said. The 
study coincided with President Clinton signing legislation that 
allows states greater freedom in spending federal education 
dollars. The bill allows states to waive certain federal education 
requirements in order to improve school and student performance.

actually have the money to buy a 1955 red Ford convertible or a Van 
Gogh painting or an antique bed. But that didn't stop the 
13-year-old boy from bidding more than $3 million for the 
merchandise and other items via the Internet auction house eBay. In 
fact, the eighth-grader was the winning bidder on $925,012 worth of 
merchandise. eBay said Andrew's account has been suspended and the 
sellers who accepted bids from him have been notified of the 
fictitious offers.

<HEADLINE> US Calls Japan Steel Prices Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration ruled today that  
Japan illegally had dumped steel on the U.S. market, bringing 
closer the penalty tariffs demanded by manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said tariffs of up to 67 percent could  
be imposed on hot-rolled carbon steel, a widely used product, 
because it had been sold for less than production costs or 
home-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Such tariffs, which can be imposed retroactively to  
mid-November, effectively would price that kind of steel out of the 
U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	Before any duties could be imposed, the U.S. International Trade  
Commission would have to find, by June, that the imports injure or 
threaten to hurt domestic industry. 
</P>
<P>
	American steel manufacturers are confident of their case. They  
blame last year's surge of low-cost steel imported to the United 
States for at least 10,000 layoffs and three company bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese steel companies believe the facts will convince the ITC  
there is no cause to impose tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that if the ITC looks at this objectively,  
independently and insulated from political pressure, we would get a 
favorable ruling,'' said Russell Smith, a lawyer for Japanese steel 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese steel companies attribute the import surge to normal  
market forces, such as a drop in demand for U.S.-made steel during 
the General Motors strike and a natural plunge in import prices 
when currencies were devalued abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	David Phelps, executive director for the American Institute for  
International Steel, which represents steel importers and 
exporters, said companies that make steel products employ 40 people 
for every steel worker, and those manufacturers would be harmed by 
duties on essential materials. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to hurt their ability to compete in the U.S. and on  
exports,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department still must issue final determinations on  
whether tariffs should be imposed against Brazil and Russia for 
their hot-rolled steel shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on Brazil has been delayed until July 6. A ruling on  
Russia is due June 10, but that country may be able to avoid 
tariffs if its agreement to curb steel shipments to the United 
States is ratified by both countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has passed legislation that would impose quotas on  
steel imports. But it has drawn opposition from the Clinton 
administration fearful of a trade war that could hurt other 
industries.

<HEADLINE> Honda Halts Electric Car Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Honda will stop building electric cars,  
writing them off in their infancy as expensive, inconvenient and 
unpopular flops. 
</P>
<P>
	While environmentalists criticized the move Thursday, it may be  
indicative of the auto industry's movement away from pure electric 
cars and toward hybrids that use other low-emission technology such 
as fuel cells. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were making money on the cars it would be a different  
story, but these are not moneymakers,'' American Honda Motor Co. 
spokesman Art Garner said Thursday in Torrance, Calif. ``Given the 
current technology, we have no plans to build them in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota, General Motors, Ford, DaimlerChysler and Nissan all say  
they will continue to produce battery-powered cars, but will pursue 
the development of other technologies as a possible alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	Many automakers have focused on developing hybrid engines that  
run on fuel cells, which produce electricity through the 
low-emission chemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists said Honda has prematurely abandoned the  
battery technology, which is designed to help rid car exhaust from 
high-population areas. The Honda cars were introduced in May 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``This project is still taking baby steps,'' said Richard  
Varenchik, spokesman for California Air Resources Board. ``We're 
very unhappy with this. If the technology is not ready yet, you 
don't get there by stopping. You continue to refine the product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The project is of particular importance in California, which at  
18 million cars has the nation's most automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Pure electric cars satisfy the state's stringent air quality  
rules, which mandate that, starting in 2003, fully 6 percent of all 
new cars sold by top automakers must be low-emission vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	California has an additional 2003 requirement that 4 percent of  
all new vehicles produce zero-emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Only electric cars, which emit no smoke at all, satisfy that  
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybrid cars, though they don't meet the 4 percent requirement,  
do produce less emissions than conventional cars and may better 
satisfy the needs of motorists, said Christopher Cedergren, an 
analyst with Nextrend, a marketing and research firm in Thousand 
Oaks, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, electric cars were just not consumer friendly,'' he  
said. ``They were too expensive to buy ... and barely got people to 
and from work. People won't pay to be inconvenienced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few electric vehicles can travel more than 75 miles before  
needing to be recharged. A battery pack adds hundreds of pounds to 
a car and costs thousands of dollars to replace. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, most manufacturers only lease the pure electric  
cars, a way to regulate new technology. Costs to lease the EVs are 
high -- the average monthly payment is about $450 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda has leased about 300 of its EV Plus cars in California and  
only a handful elsewhere in the nation, Garner said -- the Electric 
Vehicle Association of America put the number at 267 nationwide. 
The spokesman added that the company struggled to distribute them. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts have decried California's smog restrictions,  
saying technology is not advanced enough to meet them. 
</P>
<P>
	The state is ``mandating technology that isn't there yet,'' said  
Cedergren, the analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``If automakers could make a car that runs on nothing, they  
would,'' he said. ``With gasoline prices (so high), the oil 
companies are no friends to the automotive industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Keebler, the Detroit editor of Motor Trend magazine, said  
environmentalists have blindly latched on to the idea that electric 
engines are the only solution to pollution. Other alternatives like 
fuel cells might prove more practical and nearly as effective. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point is to clean the air, not make electric cars,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda is developing a prototype of a zero-emission gasoline  
engine, but it is uncertain whether it will be ready by 2003, 
Garner said.

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl Computer Virus Author ID'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A former computer engineering student was  
identified by his college today as the author of the Chernobyl 
virus -- the menace that caused hundreds of thousands of computer 
meltdowns around the world this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tatung Institute of Technology had punished Chen Ing-hau  
last April when the virus he wrote as a student began to cause 
damage in an inter-college data system, according to Lee Chee-chen, 
the institute's dean of student affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen, who was a senior at the time, was given a demerit but not  
expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chernobyl virus is known in Taiwan as the CIH, using Chen's  
initials. 
</P>
<P>
	The college did not mete out a more severe punishment because  
Chen had warned fellow students not to spread the virus, Lee said. 
Chen did not come up with an anti-virus program, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said he was not sure how the virus ended up causing so much  
destruction a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen graduated from the college last summer and now is serving  
Taiwan's two-year compulsory military service, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Bureau of Criminal Investigation said they  
would seek permission to question Chen. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusually destructive virus -- timed to strike on April 26,  
the 13th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster -- tries to 
erase a computer's hard drive and write gibberish into its system 
settings to prevent the machine from being restarted. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey and South Korea each reported 300,000 computers damaged  
Monday, and there were more elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East. 
Fewer than 10,000 of the 50 million computers in the United States 
were affected.

<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky is one step closer to the Hockey  
Hall of Fame after the selection committee today eliminated the 
standard three-year waiting period for the Great One. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of directors, which has last say in induction matters,  
must also approve the much-anticipated move at a June 14 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's nomination for induction will then be discussed at a  
meeting on June 23, the Hall announced today. The next induction 
ceremony is scheduled for Nov. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, the all-time leader in points, goals and assists,  
retired after playing his final game with the New York Rangers on 
April 18. He scored 894 goals, 1,963 assists and 2,857 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to waive the waiting period was unanimous. The Hall  
has previously waived the waiting period for 10 players, ranging 
from Mario Lemieux to Maurice ``Rocket'' Richard.

<HEADLINE> Teen Pregnancy Rate Keeps Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Talking about sex isn't easy for Laverne  
Coates, and she would rather assume that her daughter isn't having 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to hear about it,'' she said. ``I don't want to  
know about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She's made it clear, though, that pregnancy is not acceptable,  
and somehow, her daughter Tamara got the message. Tamara has been 
having sex for two years, she says, but she always uses 
contraception. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, having a child in high school is not fun,'' Tamara  
Hayman, 18, of Baltimore said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidently, a lot of teens are getting the message: Teen  
pregnancy plummeted 17 percent in the 1990s to the lowest level 
since 1973, according to statistics being released today. Teen 
abortion rates were down, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made real progress -- and must do more -- to encourage  
more young people to delay parenthood,'' said Vice President Al 
Gore, who plans a roundtable discussion with teen-agers at the 
White House today. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers point to a mix of reasons, including more reliable  
contraception, fear of AIDS, a new focus on abstinence and even the 
strong economy. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's fresh evidence that the peer pressure so many  
parents worry about actually does more good than harm. 
</P>
<P>
	Two new reports document the decline. New statistics from the  
Department of Health and Human Services show that births to 
teen-agers fell 4 percent in 1997, helping to push the national 
birth rate for all women to a record low. 
</P>
<P>
	And a report from the Alan Guttmacher Institute finds teen  
pregnancy dropped 4 percent in 1996 and fell 17 percent from its 
peak in 1990. The Guttmacher statistics combine the birth data with 
statistics on abortion and estimates for miscarriages. 
</P>
<P>
	The HHS report, which looks at a host of birth data, also found  
a new record low for births to unmarried black women and a 
continued decline in out-of-wedlock births in 1997. The year saw a 
record high for women getting early prenatal care and a record low 
rate of women smoking during pregnancy, down to 13.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, there were about 880,000 teen pregnancies in 1996 --  
just under one for every 10 teen women. Sixty-two percent of them 
were 18- and 19-year-olds; the rest were 15 to 17 years old. The 
report did not look at teens under 15. 
</P>
<P>
	About one in three pregnancies were aborted, as the teen  
abortion rate dropped 3 percent in 1996. It fell 31 percent from 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the decline in pregnancy is due to increased use of  
birth control, said Jacqueline E. Darroch, a vice president at 
Guttmacher, a private research group. She noted that 11 percent of 
15- to 19-year-olds now use long-acting, highly effective birth 
control methods such as Depo-Provera shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Condom use also increased as fear of AIDS spread in the '90s.  
And national surveys point to decreased teen sexual activity as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Other explanations are harder to pin down, including an  
explosion of abstinence and pregnancy prevention programs and a 
strong economy that may be giving teens more hope for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, for the first time, research suggests positive peer  
pressure may be stronger than the negative pressures parents 
usually fear. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanging out with friends who do well in school and don't drink  
or smoke will help a teen avoid pregnancy, researchers found. But, 
contrary to many parents' fears, hanging out with kids who engage 
in these and other risky behaviors doesn't make much difference, 
said Brad Brown of the University of Wisconsin, who analyzed a 
federal survey of teens for the National Campaign to Prevent Teen 
Pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some at the campaign are concerned that people believe  
the teen pregnancy problem has been solved. They note that U.S. 
rates are still higher than those of other industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamara Kreinin, who travels the country for the campaign,  
worries that condom use will decline as fear of AIDS recedes. 
``What I'm hearing from kids is you don't die from AIDS any more,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But HHS Secretary Donna Shalala was more optimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people are that naive about American  
teen-agers,'' she said. ``We need to keep the same focus and 
philosophy and send consistent messages to every generation.''

<HEADLINE> AMP Restructuring To Cut Work Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- AMP Inc. is eliminating approximately  
8,000 jobs, or 15 percent of its work force, as its new owners try 
to restore the $5.5 billion company to leadership in the market for 
connectors for electric and electronic devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts announced Thursday in a worldwide work force of 48,800  
provide firm figures after more than a year of attempts to 
restructure the company, which has been hit hard by the Asian 
economic crisis and a failed expansion. The business, bought 
earlier this month by Bermuda-based Tyco International Ltd., hopes 
to save $1 billion over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, AMP shook up its top management and cut 4,800 jobs as  
part of a plan to save $400 million. But that effort failed because 
all those jobs were replaced within a few months, AMP's president, 
Jurgen Gromer, said in a telephone interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest round of cuts include all those jobs that were  
replaced and an additional 3,200 positions. Earlier reports, later 
denied by Tyco, said Tyco was planning to cut 4,000 jobs at AMP on 
top of the job cuts announced by AMP last year. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the positions being eliminated will be in the  
United States, including 2,100 in Pennsylvania and 900 in North 
Carolina. Approximately 1,000 additional job cuts will be spread 
across 42 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada and Utah are the  
only states not affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the jobs are being eliminated by layoffs, with the rest  
through attrition and employee buyouts. 
</P>

	The company makes connectors for devices that are put into just

<HEADLINE> Bush Committee Expects $15M by June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Republican Gov. George W. Bush hopes to  
raise at least $15 million by June 30, his presidential exploratory 
committee says. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker refused to comment Thursday on  
a report published by The Dallas Morning News that Bush's 
fund-raising machine already had brought in $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush formed his presidential committee in early March, raising  
$7.6 million in 28 days, a pace of $271,000 a day, according to the 
March 31 report filed with the Federal Election Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Bush's father, the former president, attended a  
fund-raising event for Bush in Arizona, and his exploratory 
committee has continued its other fund-raising work. Bush himself 
has attended no fund-raising events thus far. 
</P>
<P>
	Several recent national opinion polls have made Bush a  
front-runner for the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Morning News, Bush told Virginia fund-raisers  
in a conference call this week that he had banked $11 million so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is considering bypassing federal campaign funds for next  
year's GOP primaries. Such action would allow him to ignore 
spending limits in next year's presidential primary states.

<HEADLINE> Controversy on Dolphin Safe Label </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal officials said today a new standard  
for the decade-long ``dolphin safe'' label on cans of tuna will 
help spur international efforts to protect dolphins. Critics 
insisted more dolphins will be killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department issued a new standard today that allows  
the use of the ``dolphin safe'' label on tuna caught with huge 
encircling nets. Historically these nets also have ensnarled many 
dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the change will help international efforts to  
protect dolphin and other marine life, but critics said the new 
standard will lead to more dolphins being killed as they get caught 
in tuna nets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department, however, said that it found  
insufficient evidence to conclude that the tuna nets cause a 
``significant adverse impact'' on dolphin that often swim with tuna 
in the eastern Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 law lifted the embargo on tuna caught by encircling nets  
and it directed the Commerce Department to redefine the dolphin 
safe label by the spring of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Garcia, assistant commerce secretary for oceans and  
atmosphere, disputed claims that the change will lead to more 
dolphin deaths. He said that the law requires observers on tuna 
boats using encircling nets and that they must certify no dolphin 
was killed of severely injured for that patch of tuna to carry the 
dolphin safe label. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tuna labeled dolphin safe will continue to be tuna that is  
caught without dolphin mortality or serious injury,'' Garcia said 
in an interview. ``This method of encirclement on the whole is 
better for the marine environment because it reduces bycatch of 
other species.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than 2,000 dolphins were reported killed because of tuna  
fishing last year, compared with 133,000 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	But environmentalists and marine biologists were divided over  
whether the change in the label will benefit or harm efforts to 
protect dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will cheapen the label. It will confuse consumers,'' said  
John Fitzgerald, who as an environmental lobbyist helped write the 
legislation in 1990 that led to the dolphin safe labeling. 
</P>
<P>
	David Phillips, director of Earth Island Institute's marine  
mammal project near San Francisco, called the new standard a 
``consumer fraud and a death warrant for thousands of dolphin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But such groups as Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund, the  
Center for Marine Conservation and the Environmental Defense Fund 
argue that the exclusion from the U.S. market of tuna caught 
through encirclement has only hindered international efforts to 
safeguard dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Nina Young, a marine scientist for the Center for Marine  
Conservation, said the new dolphin safe label ``creates a standard 
that is more real to fishermen'' and will reduce dolphin deaths 
because of the requirement for observers on tuna boats.

	Wages, Benefits Rise Slightly  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wages and benefits for American workers rose a  
slight 0.4 percent in the first three months of the year -- the 
smallest amount on record -- indicating the lowest unemployment in 
three decades is still not generating wage pressures. The 0.4 
percent increase reported today in the Labor Department's 
Employment Cost Benefit was just half the 0.8 percent advance that 
private economists had been expecting. In a second report today, 
the Commerce Department said sales of new homes rose 2.1 percent in 
March to an annual rate of 909,000 units. It was the first increase 
since last November when sales had hit an all-time high.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mixed on Wall Street today as  
investors again sold technology stocks but bought financial issues 
in response to a drop in interest rates. The Dow industrials 
climbed 32.93 to 10,878.38, their third straight record high close. 
Financial stocks were climbing aggressively as fresh data showing 
benign inflation pushed interest rates lower in the bond market. 
American Express was up 2 5/16 at 135 3/8. On the NYSE, advancers led 
decliners 1,670-1,309. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 8.08 to

	MCI WorldCom Tops Profit Forecasts

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom Inc. earned $709 million in the  
first three months of 1999, topping Wall Street forecasts, as 
revenues from core communications services rose 17 percent. The 
first-quarter net income, which amounted to 37 cents per share, 
included a gain of $67 million from the sale of shares in the 
Verio, an Internet service provider, and a $20 million loss from an 
investment in Brazil that was hurt by the currency crisis there. 
Without those one-time events, the company reported earnings of 36 
cents per share. MCI shares were down 3 13/16 at 83 7/8.

CheckFree system, the e-commerce company said today. At a time when 
end-of-the-month payments are coming due, customers of 21 of the 
banks that use CheckFree for electronic banking services have had 
``intermittent'' problems since early Monday, the company said. The 
banks affected are ones in which a new transaction processing 
system called Genesis is being used. CheckFree technical staffers 
believe they have found the solution to the problem, a statement 
said.

Procter &AMP; Gamble has invested $152 million to enlarge its Thailand 
manufacturing plant and turn it into the company's regional export

suffering its worst economic crisis in modern times. Procter &AMP; 
Gamble is apparently not alone, as Thailand's Board of Investment 
announced this week that the value of both local and foreign 
investment in new manufacturing plants rose 17 percent in the first 
quarter of 1999 compared with the year-earlier quarter. P&AMP;G stock

agreed nearly two years ago to establish a joint surveillance 
system to spot problems in each others' economies before they

economic outlook that Southeast Asia's economies are expected to 
start mending this year, although the pace and strength of recovery 
will depend on the impact of reforms and the mood of world

parts and specialty packaging businesses into two separate 
companies, completing a transformation of the one-time 
conglomerate. Tenneco said it expects the new packaging company to 
have 1999 sales of $3 billion, while sales for the new auto parts 
company are projected at $3.2 billion. Tenneco chairman and CEO 
Dana Mead said Tenneco believes it can reduce overhead costs by 
about $70 million by separating the two companies. Tenneco shares 
fell 11/16 to 27 9/16.

	VW Workers Protest Layoffs

	HANOVER, Germany (AP) -- More than 10,000 employees at a  
Volkswagen plant walked off their jobs to protest the automaker's 
plans to lay off 550 workers on short-term contracts, union 
officials said today. Assembly lines at the plant in Emden, 
northern Germany, have been idle since noon yesterday and will 
remain shut tomorrow, said Regina Allemann, plant representative 
for the powerful IG Metall union. IG Metall officials said they 
were incensed that VW refused to renew the short-term contracts 
while asking regular employees at Emden to work overtime.

	American Pilots Downgrade Dispute

	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines' pilots union has agreed to  
label its battle with the airline a ``minor'' dispute, potentially 
altering the union's course of action as it appeals a contempt of 
court finding which has resulted in a $45 million fine. In court 
documents filed in U.S. District Court, the Allied Pilots 
Association conceded that its dispute with American over the 
purchase of Reno Air was ``minor'' under federal labor law. The 
concession that the action was minor undercuts its legal defense of 
a February sickout that cost the company millions of dollars. The 
pilots originally called the fight a major dispute, which merited 
the sickout.

	AMP Restructuring To Cut Work Force

	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- AMP Inc. is eliminating approximately  
8,000 jobs, or 15 percent of its work force, as its new owners try 
to restore the $5.5 billion company to leadership in the market for 
connectors for electric and electronic devices. The cuts announced 
today in a worldwide work force of 48,800 provide firm figures 
after more than a year of attempts to restructure the company. The 
business, bought earlier this month by Bermuda-based Tyco 
International Ltd., hopes to save $1 billion over the next two

according to some attorneys general. The attorneys general of 
Indiana, Michigan, Missouri and Wisconsin made the recommendation 
in a filing this week to the FCC, which is reviewing the $57

concerns over whether the deal, as currently structured, would

	Brown &AMP; Williamson Seeks Safe Smoke  
</P>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. is  
attempting to remove a potentially carcinogenic compound from 
tobacco and still leave the cigarette palatable. The company is 
experimenting with a curing process developed by a small Richmond, 
Va., firm to remove some of the nitrosamines from tobacco. 
Nitrosamines, which are related to nicotine, cause cancer in 
laboratory animals. The taste issue, however, is a stumbling block, 
said Harold Burton, who has been assisting the Richmond company. He 
said the change may require a change in the ``definition of 
quality'' for tobacco.

<HEADLINE> Pamela Anderson,Tommy Lee Reconcile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Nothing, it seems -- not even divorce -- can  
keep Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee away from each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson, the former ``Baywatch'' star, and her rocker  
husband, whom she accused of beating her, said Thursday that 
they're a couple again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long, hard year, full of lessons and insights,''  
they said in a statement released by publicist Marleah Leslie. ``We 
went through a lot of pain while we were separated. And we both 
learned a lot about what's really important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They have two children, 3-year-old Brandon and 1-year-old Dylan.  
</P>
<P>
	``The boys are really happy to be spending more time with their  
dad. I'm really happy to see Tommy with his sons,'' Ms. Anderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson and Lee were divorced last year, when Lee was  
arrested for hitting her while on probation for attacking a 
photographer. Lee pleaded no contest, was given three years of 
probation and was ordered to stay 100 yards away from Ms. Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they're living together in Malibu and plan on ``moving  
slowly and carefully'' to rebuild their relationship and ``create a 
new, safe platform for their family,'' Ms. Leslie said.

<HEADLINE> Gramm: Hedge Funds Up to Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In response to the near-demise of a big  
high-risk investment fund, a White House task force is urging 
Congress to impose new disclosure requirements on hedge funds and 
to expand regulators' authority. 
</P>
<P>
	While the panel wants more public disclosures, the Senate  
Banking Commitee's chairman favors continuing the current system, 
in which banks supervise the hedge funds that do business with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, still believes ``it's really up to the  
banks'' that lend money to hedge funds to tighten their credit 
standards, spokeswoman Christi Harlan said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Gramm's view, ``People who lend money ought to know who  
they're lending to,'' Ms. Harlan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., who heads the House Banking  
subcommittee on financial institutions, warned that ``there is 
potential for financial meltdowns here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to Gramm, Roukema expressed concern that the task  
force's recommendations may not go far enough in proposing changes 
in the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-awaited recommendations stem from the near-collapse  
last September of Long-Term Capital Management, which sent shock 
waves through world financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals were made public Thursday in a report by the  
President's Working Group on Financial Markets, established after 
the October 1987 stock market crash and headed by Treasury 
Secretary Robert Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	``By enhancing transparency in the financial system, by  
increasing the amount of information made available to the public 
and by improving risk management on the part of financial 
institutions, we can help reduce'' risks, President Clinton said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the recommendations ``an important step in our efforts  
to promote more secure financial markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group is made up of officials from the Federal Reserve,  
Treasury Department, Securities and Exchange Commission and 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It has been trying for months 
to unravel the events that led to the near-meltdown of Long-Term 
Capital, a big speculative fund for wealthy individuals and 
institutional investors that is based in Connecticut and registered 
in the Cayman Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	While the 3,000 or so hedge funds operating in this country are  
largely unregulated, the Fed and the Treasury do have 
responsibility for the nation's banking system, which could be 
severely affected by a major hedge-fund collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Long-Term Capital debacle ``highlighted the possibility that  
problems at one financial institution could be transmitted to other 
institutions, and potentially pose risks to the (entire) financial 
system,'' the task force's report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel is recommending that:  
</P>
<P>
	--Hedge funds be required by law to disclose their financial data  
to federal regulators every three months. Currently some, but not 
all, hedge funds are required to file financial reports with the 
CFTC, but the reports often are out of date and deemed confidential 
so they aren't made public. 
</P>
<P>
	--Congress give the SEC and the CFTC more authority to collect  
data on unregulated affiliates of securities firms that participate 
in hedge funds. 
</P>
<P>
	--The SEC begin requiring publicly traded companies, such as big  
banks and brokerage firms, to disclose any significant investments 
they have in hedge funds. 
</P>
<P>
	--Regulators encourage banks and brokerage firms to set aside  
more reserves to cover potential losses from hedge fund 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The working group, however, is not calling for direct government  
regulation of hedge funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Gensler, Treasury undersecretary for domestic finance, said  
Thursday the group will monitor hedge funds to determine if further 
action may be needed. Direct regulation would be ``in our capacity 
as regulators,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and SEC Chairman Arthur  
Levitt have said they believe that new government controls on hedge 
funds aren't needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-Term Capital's near-collapse, after its managers bet wrong  
on interest-rate swings, threatened financial markets in September. 
The Federal Reserve stepped in and helped arrange a $3.6 billion 
bailout by a group of major banks and brokerage firms. 
</P>
<P>
	The investors in -- and rescuers of -- Long-Term Capital included  
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter, Travelers Group, UBS Securities Inc. and several big 
European banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks and securities firms that invested in the hedge fund  
``did have information on Long-Term Capital,'' Gensler told 
reporters. The issue was how the financial companies used that 
information to extend credit to the fund, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're reviewing the details (of the report) and look forward  
to working constructively with the regulators and Congress to 
address the issues raised,'' said Rich Silverman, a Merrill Lynch 
spokesman. He declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Rosenthal, a spokesman for Long-Term Capital, had no  
comment on the report.

<HEADLINE> HUD Working on Affordable Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Department of Housing and Urban  
Development is taking steps to preserve thousands of federally 
subsidized housing units for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Thursday the department will  
begin increasing payments to landlords who participate in the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the payments, set years ago, are below current market  
levels, and increasing them may entice landlords to stay in the 
program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased payments will cost $30 million this fiscal year,  
HUD said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also will continue working with Congress to draft  
a long-term, comprehensive solution to the problem, Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important reform that will help protect families  
who need and deserve decent housing, at a fair cost to the American 
taxpayer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under one part of the 25-year-old Section 8 program, landlords  
agree to rent their properties to low-income people, who then pay 
about 30 percent of their income as rent. In return, the government 
pays the difference between what the tenant pays and what the 
apartment would cost on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	Landlords or HUD can end the arrangement when the contracts  
expire. Most landlords continue in the program, Cuomo said, but 
problems arise when landlords leave. The poor must either pay the 
higher rents or find new housing. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next five years, two-thirds of all such contracts will  
expire, affecting nearly 14,000 properties with 1 million 
subsidized units, Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 17,000 subsidized units at more than 300 properties  
left the program last year, according to a report on the issue 
released Thursday by HUD. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as ``project-based'' Section 8 because the subsidies are  
tied to specific rental units, the program now serves about 1.4 
million families nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Another form of the housing subsidy is known as ``tenant-based''  
Section 8. Renters receive vouchers they can take with them from 
unit to unit in search of housing. This portion of the program now 
serves about 1.5 million families. 
</P>
<P>
	Several bills to address the problem are pending in Congress.

<HEADLINE> Missing Kids Center May Get Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee voted Wednesday to recognize  
a federally funded organization's efforts to help locate missing 
and exploited children by authorizing $10 million a year for the 
center over the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort would free the National Center for Missing and  
Exploited Children, which Congress created in 1984, from applying 
for the federal grants it relies on to run a national resource 
center and a national, 24-hour telephone hot line. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arlington, Va.-based center received $8.1 million this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Since its creation, the center has worked with the FBI, Justice  
Department and other law enforcement agencies to help find more 
than 40,100 missing children, said Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., 
sponsor of a bill to authorize the annual funding. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Education and Workforce Committee cleared the measure  
by voice vote, sending it to the full House for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed similar legislation last week.  
</P>
<P>
	Castle said annual appropriations will ensure that the center  
can focus on helping families without interruption for the next 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would renew a law that directs federal funds to  
areas with large numbers of runaway youths, including for grants 
for shelter and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House Republican leaders unveiled a measure drafted  
to focus attention on child abuse. Among other steps, it would 
allow states to use federal law enforcement grants for child abuse 
prevention and give caseworkers access to criminal conviction 
records, said Rep. Deborah Pryce, R-Ohio, a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The missing children's bill is H.R. 905.

<HEADLINE> Cal State Fullerton on Probation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FULLERTON, Calif. (AP) -- Cal State Fullerton was placed on four  
years probation by the NCAA on Thursday for violations involving 
the men's basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Division I Committee on Infractions decided that the Titans'  
basketball program will lose two scholarships for the next two 
years, from 13 to 11, and barred scholarships for junior college 
transfers for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no sanctions regarding postseason play or television.  
</P>
<P>
	The violations mostly involved recruiting and providing improper  
inducements. 
</P>
<P>
	``The committee also found a lack of institutional control and  
that the university failed to adequately monitor its athletics 
programs,'' the NCAA said in a statement from Overland Park, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the report said, several JC players received assistance  
with registering and paying the costs of correspondence courses at 
other institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospects also received assistance in course registration at  
junior colleges and payment of tuition, and received improper cash 
payments, lodging, transportation and other benefits, the NCAA 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal State Fullerton's basketball coach at that time was Brad  
Holland, who left in September 1994 to become coach at the 
University of San Diego. Bob Hawking has been the coach for six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The university said it would decide whether to appeal.

<HEADLINE> Panel OKs Anti-Flag-Burn Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate panel today approved a proposed  
constitutional amendment that would allow Congress to ban flag 
burning. The proposal is given its best chance in years of being 
referred to the states for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	By 11-7, the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended Senate  
approval of the 17-word amendment that attained far more than the 
two-thirds majority required in the House in 1997. What has changed 
this year is the support for the measure in the Senate, where it 
fell three votes short in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Approval by two-thirds in both the House and Senate and  
ratification by three-fourths of the states would add the provision 
to the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott earlier this month put the  
amendment on his legislative priority list, and several Republican 
senators said they expect the issue to come to the floor for a vote 
before Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the factors changing the lineup this time are the election  
of former Ohio Gov. George Voinovich, a Republican who supports the 
constitutional amendment, to the seat vacated by retired Sen. John 
Glenn, a Democrat who opposed it. Also, North Dakota Democrats 
Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad, both of whom voted against the 
amendment in 1995, are currently undecided, their spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the amendment say it would restrict the  
constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech. Supporters say its 
worth changing the Constitution for the values the amendment 
symbolizes. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate in the Senate crosses party lines. Sen. John Chafee,  
R-R.I., for example, chided supporters of the measure on Wednesday 
by telling the Judiciary Committee that ``We cannot mandate respect 
and pride in the flag.'' He said the amendment is an overreaction 
to a rare practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told the committee  
today that she supports the amendment because the flag ``is a 
monument in fabric that hangs as a symbol of our nation'' and its 
values. 
</P>
<P>
	During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday, one  
supporter even said the amendment would be a first step toward 
healing some of the nation's ills, including the factors that led 
two teen-agers to kill 12 fellow students and a teacher at 
Columbine High School before killing themselves on April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of our cultural problems today, and yes, Littleton,  
Colo., fits into that'' are the result of ``lack of respect for 
things bigger than ourselves,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb. The 
flag, he said, ``is a symbol in itself of our values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In part because of the changing odds, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,  
sought help from an old friend and colleague: Glenn. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronaut, Korean War veteran and staunch opponent of the  
amendment told the committee the proposal would undermine some of 
the very constitutional rights the flag symbolizes. Desecrating the 
flag, Glenn said, is not a widespread practice and even if it were, 
such expression is a right guaranteed by the Constitution's freedom 
of speech clause. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would indeed be a hollow victory to protect a symbol by  
taking any chance at chipping away at the freedoms themselves,'' 
Glenn told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, he said, the legislation poorly defines desecration and  
the word ``flag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``How are you going to define that? How are we going to  
administer that?'' Glenn said. Noting that he recently saw flags 
being sold as clothing, such as bikinis and boxer shorts, he asked, 
``If they soil it, is that desecration? How about a bumper sticker 
(picturing an American flag) covered with dust?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But proponents of the legislation fired back, contending that  
protecting the flag's symbolism is important enough to amend the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a decorated Vietnam veteran who spent  
five years as a prisoner of war, told of a fellow prisoner, Mike 
Christian, who was severely beaten for hiding an American flag in 
captivity and pulling it out daily for a secret recitation of the 
pledge of allegiance. After the beating, Christian stitched red, 
white and blue pieces of cloth together so he and his fellow 
prisoners could continue the ritual that held such meaning for 
them, McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us are products of our experience in life, and that's  
my experience,'' McCain told the panel. ``American blood has been 
shed all over the world for the American flag ... and I believe it 
deserves respect.''

<HEADLINE> Magnetic Strips on Mars Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The discovery of magnetic strips across the  
face of Mars suggests the barren planet once had geology like that 
of Earth, with a torrid interior spurting molten rock and massive 
plates drifting on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Instruments aboard the Mars Global Surveyor have detected  
magnetic striations that closely resemble the magnetic signature of 
crustal spreading and continental drift on the Earth, researchers 
report in a study to be published Friday in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	This may mean the very young Mars resembled the very young  
Earth, but that Mars ran out of its internal energy sources and 
became a geologically dead planet early in its history, said Norman 
F. Ness of the University of Delaware and co-author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``The data suggests that Mars was once magnetic and was far more  
similar to Earth's global magnetic field than had previously 
assumed,'' Ness said. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence of this magnetic field is frozen in rocks that were  
molten when the magnetic field existed. When the rocks hardened 
they retained the original magnetism and that now has been detected 
and mapped by the spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the present time there is no evidence of a global magnetic  
field on Mars,'' said Ness. ``That means the dynamo died and what 
is left is the memory of that dynamo, stored in the crustal rocks 
like a magnetic tape recording.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pattern of magnetic rock closely resembles the streaks that  
led scientists to discover on Earth that continents sit atop 
immense crustal plates that inch about the globe over millions of 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists previously believed that continental drift occurred  
only on Earth because studies had shown the process did not take 
place on Venus, the solar system planet nearest Earth's size, said 
Ness. 
</P>
<P>
	But the discovery of Martian magnetic striations suggests that  
Mars may also have had continent-sized plates that split apart on 
the surface of the planet and inched apart, pushed by the flow of 
magma bubbling up through crustal rifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ness said the energy that heated the rock apparently ran out  
within a few hundred million years and Mars became a geologically 
dead planet. The solar system, including the Earth and Mars, are 
thought to have formed 4 billion years ago to 4.5 billion years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicki L. Hansen, a Southern Methodist University geologist, said  
that the fate of Mars also awaits the Earth. She said that 
eventually Earth also will exhaust its internal energy and its 
molten core will cool. This will shut down the planet's magnetic 
field and allow radiation from the sun to strip away the Earth's 
atmosphere and water. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Mars went through at a very young age is what will occur  
on the Earth eventually,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ness said that Mars died much more quickly than Earth because  
the red planet is smaller and had much less internal heat generated 
by friction and the decay of radioactive minerals.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan, China Both Seek To Join WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- At odds with China on most fronts, Taiwan  
has found a common quest with its rival: the desire for membership 
in the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Taiwan has maintained it is as important as China  
when it comes to world trade, so its application for membership in 
the international trade group should be treated separately. 
</P>
<P>
	But as China has drawn closer to entry, Taiwan has decided to  
pin its hopes of joining the WTO on China's coattails. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan has completed all trade negotiations required by WTO  
members, and is continuing its own lobbying efforts. Taiwanese 
Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang departs for Washington on Monday 
to seek U.S. support of Taiwan's entry this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nation believes its admission is stalled because WTO  
members don't want to risk the ire of China, which claims 
sovereignty over Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing insists that it must get into the WTO first, then Taiwan  
can follow as long as the island is admitted as a ``tariff zone'' 
and not as a nation. ``We hope relevant parties will observe 
this,'' said Sun Yuxi, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Separated politically since a civil war in 1949, Taiwan and  
China do not recognize each other, and Taiwan has refused official 
contacts with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	As a global outcast, Taiwan hopes WTO membership could give it  
more international exposure. Taiwan is denied preferential tariff 
treatments by most countries and access to international 
arbitration of trade disputes -- benefits it hopes to gain through 
WTO membership. 
</P>
<P>
	China has stepped up its drive for WTO membership and offered  
substantial concessions to lower trade barriers in areas ranging 
from telecommunications to insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Continued worries over China's concessions in financial  
services, steel and textile businesses prompted President Clinton 
to lobby against China's membership earlier this month. Still, WTO 
secretary-general Renato Ruggiero says China might qualify for 
membership as early as November. 
</P>
<P>
	That came as a great relief to Taiwan's WTO negotiators.  
Membership is so appealing to Taiwan that officials are casting 
aside concerns that a WTO spot could draw Beijing closer to 
Washington and thus imperil Taiwan's political interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan even indicated it could negotiate with China to remove  
trade barriers against Chinese goods once both are admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	After Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji agreed to concessions when  
visiting Washington early this month, Taiwanese President Lee 
Teng-hui said the two sides could talk about trade and agriculture 
cooperation once both are in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an open mind, and we are willing to talk about many  
issues,'' Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	With both in the WTO, Taiwan is bound to face escalating  
pressure to ease trade barriers against Chinese farm goods, allow 
Chinese firms to invest in Taiwan and end its ban on air and 
shipping links. Meanwhile, Taiwanese economists expect China to 
open its markets further in exchange for foreign capital and 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	One persistent fear is that China will balk if Western countries  
demand more severe trade concessions, thereby dampen Taiwan's hopes 
of joining. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, amid U.S. complaints about a growing trade deficit, Taiwan  
fears further delays would give Washington a chance to reopen trade 
negotiations with stricter demands. Taiwan has already made 
concessions on U.S. pork imports and car imports from other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have already suffered trade losses but have yet to enjoy  
any benefits,'' said Kuo Weng-cheng, an economist at the Chunghwa 
Institute of Economic Research. ``Public support for WTO accession 
would drop if we can't be admitted this year.''

<HEADLINE> Tenneco To Split Parts, Packaging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Tenneco Inc., maker of Hefty trash bags  
and Monroe shock absorbers, has decided to split its automotive 
parts and specialty packaging businesses into two separate 
companies, completing a transformation of the one-time 
conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenneco said it expects the new packaging company to have 1999  
sales of $3 billion, while sales for the new auto parts company are 
projected at $3.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenneco's current headquarters in Greenwich, Conn., will close  
when the separation of the two companies is completed. The 
corporate headquarters of both new companies will be in Lake 
Forest, Ill., where the operating headquarters of both divisions 
are now based. 
</P>
<P>
	About 45 jobs at the Greenwich office will be eliminated.  
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff, which had been expected for some time, completes a  
restructuring started in 1992. A decade ago, Tenneco had seven 
distinct businesses, including shipbuilding, farm equipment, gas 
pipelines, chemicals, minerals, packaging and auto parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Last July, Tenneco chairman and CEO Dana Mead said the company  
was considering separating the two remaining businesses, hoping to 
revive a sluggish stock price and tighten the company's focus. 
</P>
<P>
	During a conference call with reporters Thursday, Mead said  
Tenneco believes it can reduce overhead costs by about $70 million 
by separating the two companies. He said the company hopes 
investors will respond more favorably to the two ``pure play,'' or 
focused companies, rather than the current Tenneco, an industrial 
conglomerate with an awkward mix of businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said separating the companies would be especially  
beneficial to the specialty-packaging business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The auto industry is ... high investments and low margin  
return. By moving the automotive unit out, you don't have that 
burden of having to invest large sums of money,'' said Michael 
Schmall, managing partner of The Planning Edge, an automotive 
industry consulting firm based in Troy, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenneco Automotive, which makes Walker mufflers as well as  
Monroe shocks, had sales of $3.24 billion last year. The unit has 
approximately 23,600 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenneco Packaging, which makes Hefty trash bags, Baggies food  
storage bags and E-Z Foil single-use aluminum cookware, had 1998 
sales of $2.76 billion. The business has 15,700 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Mead said the company has not yet decided what to name the two  
new companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Tenneco reported first-quarter income from  
continuing operations of $45 million, or 27 cents per share, 
compared with $75 million, or 44 cents per share, in the same 
period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported revenues of $1.85 billion, before charges  
related to the sale of the containerboard business and other 
transactions related to the realignment of Tenneco's corporate 
functions. Revenue in the same period of 1998 was $1.81 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges in the quarter totaled $195 million after-tax, or $1.17  
per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. predicted Tenneco would  
have income from continuing operations of 23 cents a share, 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Tenneco slipped 68 3/4 cents to $27.62 1/2 on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Bishop Estate Resignations Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- The leader of a multibillion-dollar trust  
created for the educational enrichment of Hawaiian children says he 
will not resign under pressure from the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS is threatening to revoke the tax-exempt status of the  
Bishop Estate, one of the nation's largest charitable trusts, 
unless its five trustees resign immediately, The Honolulu 
Advertiser and the Honolulu Star-Bulletin reported Wednesday, 
citing unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't intend to step down until I'm shown some factual  
evidence of what I am being accused of,'' said trustee Richard 
``Dickie'' Wong. 
</P>
<P>
	Wong said fellow trustees Henry Peters, Gerard Jervis, Lokelani  
Lindsey and Oswald Stender -- who each earn $840,000 annually to 
manage the estate -- were surprised by the IRS' stance. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust, established by the 1884 will of Princess Bernice  
Pauahi Bishop to educate ``the children of Hawaii,'' has assets 
valued at up to $10 billion and is the state's largest private 
landowner. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1996, the trustees have been involved in a melodrama of  
boardroom intrigue, questionable investments, IRS audits and 
criminal investigations. Several petitions seeking their removal 
have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Wong and Peters have been indicted for allegedly receiving  
a kickback on an estate land deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The state claims the trustees invested $350 million in income  
instead of following the will's direction and spending it on its 
beneficiary, the Kamehameha Schools, a 600-acre campus for 3,100 
students of Hawaiian descent on a wooded hillside overlooking 
downtown Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS in Honolulu did not return several calls seeking  
comment. In the past, the agency has refused to confirm or deny 
that it was auditing the Bishop Estate. 
</P>
<P>
	A Bishop Estate spokesman did not return a message seeking  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Hospital Misdiagnoses Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATTLEBORO, Mass. (AP) -- A suburban hospital found that 19 men it  
had told did not have cancer actually did. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturdy Memorial Hospital said today that it could not discuss  
the condition of the 17 living patients who were misdiagnosed for 
prostate cancer between 1995 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital President and CEO Linda Shyavitz also refused to  
specify how the tests were misread or to identify the two 
pathologists believed responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medicine is a very complex science provided by humans who are  
fallible,'' she said. ``Our system broke down during this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Bruce Auerbach, the hospital's associate medical director,  
said a review of prostate tests from 1995-97 was triggered in 
February after a positive test result for a patient contradicted an 
exam from 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The urologist treating the patient brought the discrepancy to  
the attention of the hospital's chief pathologist, who then ordered 
the full review. 
</P>
<P>
	Shyavitz defended the hospital's delay in not notifying patients  
with misread tests until March and, in some cases, April. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to make sure we had all the facts together,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Shyavitz said all of the 17 men still alive were under the  
active care of a urologist. The two others died of causes unrelated 
to their prostate cancer, hospital officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty prostate tests were misread between January 1995 and  
December 1997, including the biopsy of a patient who had two 
separate tests to detect malignant cells in the walnut-sized organ 
located just below the bladder. 
</P>
<P>
	The erroneous tests were among 270 prostate biopsies examined by  
two pathologists employed at the hospital. Shyavitz would not name 
the doctors or explain why they had left their positions, saying 
only that they had not been disciplined by the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the prostate test mistakes, the hospital will review  
6,000 other tissue tests conducted during the three-year window in 
search of serious illnesses, including cancer.

<HEADLINE> Wages, Benefits Rise Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wages and benefits for American workers rose a  
slight 0.4 percent in the first three months of the year, the 
smallest amount on record, indicating the lowest unemployment in 
three decades is still not generating wage pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The 0.4 percent increase reported today in the Labor  
Department's Employment Cost Benefit was just half the 0.8 percent 
advance that private economists had been expecting. The 
first-quarter gain followed a much larger, 0.7 percent advance from 
October through December of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	While small wage and benefit gains are generally not good news  
for workers, the moderation in wage pressures is occurring at a 
time of low inflation as well, meaning that workers' take-home-pay 
is not being eroded by higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second report today, the Commerce Department said sales of  
new homes rose 2.1 percent in March to an annual rate of 909,000 
units. It was the first increase since last November when sales had 
hit an all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
	The March advance reflected a huge, 24 percent surge in activity  
in the West, the biggest monthly advance in that region in four 
years. Sales in the rest of the country fell. 
</P>
<P>
	All the good economic news was pushing the high-flying stock  
market even higher. The Dow Jones industrial average, which has 
closed at record highs for two straight days, was up 55 points in 
morning trading. The inflation-sensitive bond market was also 
enjoying a rally on the absence of wage pressures depicted in the 
employment cost report. 
</P>
<P>
	The slack wage pressures are occurring even though the overall  
unemployment rate dipped to a 29-year-low of 4.2 percent in March. 
For all of last year, unemployment averaged its lowest level in 
three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of slight wage pressure and low unemployment has  
given the Federal Reserve the leeway to allow the economy to 
continue growing at a rapid clip without feeling the need to start 
raising interest rates to prevent inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This certainly says to the Fed that there isn't any wage  
pressure in the pipeline,'' said Cynthia Latta, economist at 
Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. She said she believed this report and others 
showing moderate inflation will allow the Fed to keep interest 
rates unchanged for the entire year. 
</P>
<P>
	A second report today showed further good news for American  
workers. The Labor Department said new claims for unemployment 
benefits declined by a larger-than-expected amount last week, 
falling to 294,000 new claims, down 20,000 people from the week 
before. It was the biggest one-week decline in three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer new claims for unemployment benefits mean job layoffs are  
declining. The big drop in claims was a surprise to analysts, who 
had expected little change following a decline of 5,000 the 
previous week after two weeks of increases in applications. 
</P>
<P>
	The 0.4 percent rise in wages and benefits was the smallest  
quarterly advance since the Labor Department began tracking these 
figures in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall gain reflected a 0.5 percent advance in wages and  
salaries and a 0.3 percent rise in benefit costs, which include 
health insurance and pension contributions. The wages and salaries 
increase was the smallest since September 1992 and the benefit 
advance was the lowest since March 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 12 months ending in March, overall employment costs were  
up 3 percent, an even better showing than a 3.3 percent rise for 
the 12 months ending in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The current economic expansion is already the longest in  
peacetime history with uninterrupted growth for more than eight 
years. Well before this point in most previous expansions, tight 
labor markets have triggered rising wage demands and forced the 
Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates to slow the 
economy, a process that often leads to a new recession. 
</P>
<P>
	By industry, the biggest rise in wages and benefits was enjoyed  
by service workers, a rise of 1.1 percent. Manufacturing workers 
saw wages and benefits increase by just 0.6 percent. This sector 
has been the hardest hit by the Asian currency crisis, suffering a 
loss of more than 300,000 jobs in the past year.

<HEADLINE> Thieves in $17M Heist Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A man caught on videotape looting an  
armored car company vault of $17 million -- one of the biggest 
thefts of its kind in U.S. history -- has been sentenced to 7 1/2 years 
in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your honor, if I could undo what I did, I would,'' David Scott  
Ghantt said before being sentenced Thursday by U.S. District Judge 
Graham Mullen. ``I was stuck in a go-nowhere job, and I wasn't 
happy with my life. I'm sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ghantt, 29, a former Loomis truck driver and supervisor, was  
recorded in October 1997 at the company's Charlotte vault loading 
large amounts of cash into a truck. He became the target of a 
nationwide FBI manhunt and was arrested five months later near the 
Mexican island resort of Cozumel. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors charged more than 20 people in the case. All but one  
have pleaded guilty to charges stemming from bank larceny to money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $2 million is still missing.  
</P>
<P>
	Mullen also sentenced Steven Chambers to 11 years and three  
months in federal prison for paying two conspirators to open safe 
deposit boxes to store the stolen money. 
</P>
<P>
	The men went on a huge spending spree with the money, buying a  
massive home, artworks, big-screen TVs, expensive cars, pickup 
trucks, minivans, two boats, six motorcycles and several tanning 
beds. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullen ordered the two men to pay more than $3.8 million apiece  
in restitution to Loomis and its insurer. Two lesser players in the 
heist were also sentenced Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Universities Settle Trademark Flap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Why, oh why, must they fight over  
``Ohio''? 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State University and Ohio University have settled their  
trademark dispute about the word ``Ohio,'' a fight involving 
millions of dollars from the sales of sweatshirts, hats and other 
paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
	Both schools confirmed the agreement Thursday and said attorneys  
were meeting to work out details. They declined to comment further 
until they issue a joint statement, which may not be released until 
early next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Columbus Dispatch reported that Ohio University gets the  
trademark under the deal while Ohio State keeps some rights to the 
word ``Ohio'' in future marketing and merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the schools agreed Wednesday on a proposal worked  
out by the universities' presidents, old friends who have been 
handling the matter personally, the Dispatch reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio University President Robert Glidden sent the proposal to  
OSU President William Kirwan on Monday following a meeting the two 
had last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio University's trademark royalty revenue is about $100,000 a  
year, about half from items with the Ohio trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State gets about $3 million a year in royalty income, but  
little of that is from merchandise with just Ohio on it, said Anne 
Chasser, OSU licensing director. The Big Ten school has an 
enrollment of 55,000 and a large sports following, particularly for 
its nationally ranked football team and this year's basketball 
team, which went to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio University is a smaller, Mid-American Conference school 65  
miles southeast of Columbus in the Appalachian town of Athens. Its 
enrollment is about 19,500. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s, Ohio University obtained a trademark  
registration for the word ``Ohio'' on uses such as athletic 
clothing. Ohio State did not respond until it discovered in 1997 
that its rights to such names as Ohio Stadium might technically be 
in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio University said it would allow such uses to continue. But  
Ohio State, concerned that the trademark might overly restrict its 
future uses of Ohio, challenged the registration. 
</P>
<P>
	The schools' legal affairs and public relations offices began a  
high-profile fight in December 1997. That's when Ohio State sent 
its objections to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office over Ohio 
University's exclusive right to the word. Their dispute was headed 
for the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board in Washington.

<HEADLINE>  PLO Delays Statehood Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Defusing a potentially explosive  
issue, the Palestinian leadership voted overwhelmingly today to 
delay a decision on statehood until after Israel's May 17 election. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came on the third day of debate by the PLO's Central  
Council on whether to declare statehood May 4 -- the date the 
Palestinians say marks the end of the five-year autonomy period -- 
or extend peace talks with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision not to decide for now gives Palestinian leader  
Yasser Arafat new room to maneuver at a critical time when Israeli 
voters are closely watching his every move. 
</P>
<P>
	It also robs Israel's hard-line prime minister, Benjamin  
Netanyahu, of fodder for his campaign. Netanyahu, who says he is 
the only candidate able to stand up to Palestinian demands, made 
Arafat's initial pledge to declare statehood May 4 a key campaign 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided to give ourselves an open-ended session because we  
don't want to let any decision serve Netanyahu and the Israeli 
groups that are fighting peace,'' said Abdallah Frangi, the PLO's 
representative in Germany and a PCC member. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision approved today declares the current session of the  
Central Council open-ended and convenes another general meeting of 
all 124 members in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel's election is slated for May 17, with a possible runoff  
set for June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat spent hours Wednesday night reviewing the wording of the  
PCC decision with eight council delegates drafting the resolution, 
said Ziad Abu Amr, a legislator and member of the drafting 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinian leader told the panel a delay was wise because  
he did not want to influence the Israeli election and disappoint 
the dozens of world leaders who had urged him to hold off on a 
statehood declaration, Abu Amr told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat also said Palestinians should refrain from actions that  
might backfire. They can always declare a state at a later time, 
preferably with the full support of the international community, 
Arafat argued, according to Abu Amr. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said the Palestinians  
retained all their options. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision does not cancel a declaration of statehood. It's  
only a specified postponement and the possibility of declaring a 
state stands,'' Shaath said. 
</P>
<P>
	The council also said it would take steps toward state-building,  
such as forming a committee that will start work on writing a draft 
constitution. The committee is to be headed by Ismat Abdel Maguid, 
the secretary general of the Arab League. 
</P>
<P>
	The council also authorized a smaller group, the 18-member PLO  
Executive Committee, to review letters of assurances Arafat has 
received from the European Union and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat had traversed the globe in recent weeks to drum up  
support for Palestinian independence. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for agreeing to delay a declaration of statehood,  
Arafat won EU backing for a Palestinian state within a year and the 
strongest expression of support yet for Palestinian 
self-determination from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration also said it wanted negotiations for  
a final peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians completed 
within a year, instead of open-ended negotiations as Israel wants. 
</P>
<P>
	With a delay emerging as the likely PCC decision in recent days,  
Netanyahu has repeatedly claimed credit, saying his hard-line 
policies, including the threat to annex parts of the West Bank, 
forced Arafat to back down from a unilateral statehood declaration. 
</P>
<P>
	A unilateral statehood declaration, followed by Israeli  
annexation, would likely have led to widespread bloodshed. ``We 
saved the peace process,'' Netanyahu said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a TV campaign ad Wednesday night, Netanyahu told viewers that  
he had scored a major diplomatic victory.

<HEADLINE> Man Fined for Shooting Condor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- An Arizona man has been fined $3,200 for shooting  
a California condor last month in the Grand Canyon, federal 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Tenney Owens, 24, also received a year's probation after  
pleading guilty to killing an endangered species and possessing and 
discharging a firearm in a national park. 
</P>
<P>
	Intentionally killing an endangered species carries a maximum  
sentence of a year's imprisonment and a $100,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the fine and probation, U.S. Magistrate Stephen  
Verkamp also ordered Owens to turn in the handgun used to shoot the 
condor. Owens' probation includes 200 hours of community service to 
be directed by park officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens surrendered to authorities a few days after shooting the  
condor on March 11 during a hiking and fishing trip along the 
Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old female condor was among 20 released in 1996 at  
the Vermilion Cliffs near the Grand Canyon as part of a 
reintroduction program. 
</P>
<P>
	California condors were nearly extinct until a recovery effort  
was launched in the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Says Euro Will Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The new common European currency will  
significantly alter the demand for dollars over time as a reserve 
currency but the impact will be gradual, Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, speaking Thursday at a World Bank conference on how  
nations manage currency changes, said the euro, the new currency 
launched by 11 European nations on Jan. 1, will doubtless grow as a 
reserve currency, one that a central bank holds in its reserves to 
pay foreign obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The introduction of the euro is clearly going to significantly  
alter reserve holdings,'' Greenspan said. ``As markets for 
euro-denominated assets develop, the euro should become 
increasingly attractive as a world reserve currency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At present, the dollar is the premier reserve currency in the  
world although many foreign nations, depending on where they are 
located, also hold reserves of Japanese yen or German marks. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said the fact that the euro is likely to become a  
major reserve currency in coming years should present little threat 
to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``To some extent the increased attractiveness of the euro should  
reduce the demand for dollars,'' he said. ``But history suggests 
that this effect is likely to be limited and evolutionary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing lessons learned from the global currency crisis that  
struck first in Asia in July 1997, Greenspan said that it was 
obvious that developing countries need to manage their foreign 
currency reserves and their foreign liabilities with the aim of 
minimizing vulnerability to external shocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan suggested a good rule of thumb to help accomplish this  
had been put forward by Pablo Guidotti, the deputy finance minister 
of Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	Guidotti has proposed that policy-makers in emerging market  
economies manage their external assets and liabilities so that they 
will always be able to live without new foreign borrowing for up to 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
	That would mean that the foreign country would always have  
enough in useable foreign exchange reserves to make all debt 
payments coming due over the next 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a minimum, this framework can highlight signs of  
vulnerability,'' Greenspan said. He noted that South Korea's 
short-term debts, including those owed by South Korean banks, were 
more than three times the level of the country's foreign exchange 
reserves in December 1996, the year before the Asian currency 
crisis struck that nation.

<HEADLINE> Report Blames Velcro in Jet Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- The Air Force has pinpointed the cause  
of a training crash that reduced a $10.2 million jet to debris: 
Velcro failure. 
</P>
<P>
	The fabric fastener is meant to hold a box for night-vision  
goggles on a console inside the A-10 jet cockpit. But the box came 
loose, and its strap snagged a control switch when the pilot tried 
to elbow it out of the way, investigators said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The A-10 community is looking at correcting that,'' said Maj.  
Karen Platt of the 104th Fighter Wing at Barnes Air National Guard 
Base in Westfield. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot, Capt. Ronald Halley, 30, parachuted to safety. His  
jet hurtled into the ground in the Jan. 20 crash 44 miles northeast 
of Syracuse. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot, who was wearing his night-vision goggles, was  
practicing nighttime refueling and ground attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force investigators say he was approaching an airborne  
tanker to refuel when he bumped the goggle box with his elbow. The 
Velcro holding the strap to the console let go, and the box fell 
near some throttles. The pilot tried to nudge the box out of the 
way, but its strap caught a switch that disconnects hydraulic 
power. The change sent the jet into a wild nose dive. 
</P>
<P>
	Making matters worse, the goggle box ended up covering an  
emergency control panel. The goggles themselves made it harder for 
the pilot to see warning lights. 
</P>
<P>
	In a final indignity, the goggles broke and whacked the pilot in  
the face and thigh as he drifted back to earth. He suffered a black 
eye and bruise.

<HEADLINE> Tenneco To Split Into Two Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Tenneco Inc., a once diverse,  
multi-faceted conglomerate, is splitting its two remaining 
businesses -- specialty packaging including the Hefty and Baggies 
brands and automotive parts such as Monroe shock absorbers -- into 
separate publicly traded companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction announced today will involve a spinoff to  
Tenneco shareholders. Tenneco said it expects the new packaging 
company to have 1999 sales of $3 billion, while sales for the new 
auto parts company are projected at $3.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenneco shares rose following the announcement and the release  
of quarterly earnings, climbing 50 cents to $28.75 at midmorning on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff, which had been expected for some time, will  
complete a corporate transformation of Tenneco begun in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing a major restructuring last July, Tenneco chairman  
and CEO Dana Mead said the company was considering separating the 
two remaining businesses. At the time, Mead expressed frustration 
with the company's sluggish stock price, saying the restructuring 
was part of a five-year effort to change Tenneco from an 
``unwieldy, slow-growth conglomerate'' into a strong, focused 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are convinced that the division of Tenneco into two  
separate companies has the potential to generate the greatest 
short- and long-term value in those businesses,'' Mead said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenneco also announced its earnings today, reporting income from  
continuing operations of $45 million, or 27 cents per share, 
compared with $75 million, or 44 cents per share, in the same 
period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had one-time charges totaling $195 million, or $1.17  
per share, after taxes, giving Tenneco a net loss of $291 million, 
or $1.74 per share. The charges resulted from the sale of the 
containerboard business and other transactions related to Tenneco's 
realignment. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat the expectations of analysts, who predicted  
Tenneco would have income from continuing operations of 23 cents a 
share, according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported revenues of $1.85 billion, up from $1.81  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade ago, Tenneco had seven distinct businesses, including  
shipbuilding, farm equipment and gas pipelines. In 1996, Tenneco 
spun off its Newport News Shipbuilding subsidiary and sold its 
energy division so it could focus on packaging and auto parts. The 
company also completed its sale of Case Corp., a Racine, Wis.-based 
farm and construction equipment manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, Tenneco said it intended to cut costs by $100  
million annually by reducing overhead and operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Tenneco sold the majority of its container  
boardbusiness to Madison Dearborn Partners Inc. for about $2 
billion, while keeping a 45 percent equity stake. The company also 
agreed to sell its folding-carton business to Caraustar Industries 
Inc. for $72.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, company officials had talks with rival  
automotive companies about selling the auto parts business. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenneco Automotive, which makes Walker mufflers as well as  
Monroe shocks, had sales of $3.24 billion last year. The unit, 
based in Lake Forest, Ill., has approximately 23,000 employees in 
44 plants, including 12 in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenneco Packaging, which makes Hefty trash bags, Baggies food  
storage bags and E-Z Foil single-use aluminum cookware, had 1998 
sales of $2.76 billion. The business, also headquartered in Lake 
Forest, has 15,700 employees.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Sports Community Pitches In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARVADA, Colo. (AP) -- Columbine High School junior Matt Wells  
took time out from the grieving world around him to crack a smile, 
chew on some sunflower seeds and talk about baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just good to be smiling and laughing,'' the 16-year-old  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, a catcher on the Columbine High School varsity baseball  
team, watched the junior varsity play Arvada West High School on 
Wednesday. His classmates smiled and cheered as they played ball, 
just eight days after teen-age gunmen killed 12 students and a 
teacher before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the gunmen had complained about their  
treatment at the hands of athletes at Columbine. When they burst 
into the library on April 20, one of the gunmen yelled: ``All jocks 
stand up! We're going to kill every one of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the massacre, the suburban school has become a sealed  
crime scene. Hundreds of backpacks and other personal belongings 
abandoned in the crisis still litter the hallways and classrooms. 
School athletic equipment is also unavailable, probably for the 
rest of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
	But thanks to an outpouring of donations and support from the  
community and the sports world, Columbine's baseball team has 
uniforms, gloves, balls and everything they need to get back on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the equipment and clothing donations, the Columbine  
Rebels would have been forced to end their season, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wouldn't have played,'' he said. ``We wouldn't have been  
able to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball team has received an estimated $5,000 worth of  
clothing and gear from Reebok, Mizuno, Denver Athletic Supply and 
other sports companies. The gifts included dozens of bats, stark 
navy blue uniforms, never-worn leather gloves and even athletic 
socks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're taking care of us,'' said Robin Ortiz, the Columbine  
head baseball coach. ``I hate to say it, but it's been like 
Christmas at times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team members decided they wanted to play out the rest of the  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a lot of them, it's a chance to start healing,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Some players also had the chance to realize a dream. The  
Colorado Rockies opened their doors to Columbine players Monday, 
allowing the team to work out in their hitting cages and tour Coors 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a fun experience,'' Wells said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies worked with the Denver Police Activities League to  
help coordinate the donations and support. Nick Arcuri, director of 
the activities league, said he hopes the efforts show the teens 
they are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was around these kids at practice the other night and some  
of them are afraid to smile,'' he said. ``They need to know that 
people out there care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The community outpouring has touched some Columbine students.  
Katie Crona, a junior varsity soccer player with the Rebels, said 
her team received new uniforms from Adidas and assistance from 
rival Arapahoe High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been so wonderful to us,'' the 14-year-old freshman  
said. ``It's so nice to know they care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some players said the donations and support will encourage them  
to play better. But Wells said he is more interested in simply 
trying to have fun and move beyond the tragedy that put his life on 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like getting back to normal life,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Sues 15 Florida Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is suing 15 Florida  
companies, alleging that they sold counterfeit versions of Windows 
95, Windows 98, and other company software. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft is the world's dominant maker of  
personal computer software. Its Windows operating system runs the 
basic functions of 90 percent of the world's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits filed in federal courts seek unspecified damages  
and a judge's order to stop distribution of the software, corporate 
attorney Nick Psyhogeos said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	They come at a time when technology crimes are on the rise  
throughout Florida, according to police quoted in a company 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're finding a substantial increase of technology-related  
crime in the state,'' said Phil Ramer, director of the Florida 
Department of Law Enforcement's Office of Statewide Intelligence. 
``Organized crime rings have begun to include software piracy in 
their roster of other illegal activities because of the large sums 
of money that they stand to make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses, consumers and the government are the ones who  
suffer, company executives said. 
</P>
<P>
	Software piracy cost Florida 7,186 jobs in 1997 and $490 million  
in lost wages, tax revenue and retail sales, said Psyhogeos, citing 
a Microsoft-commissioned study from International Planning &AMP; 
Research Corp., a market research company. 
</P>
<P>
	And counterfeit software, which often has viruses and bugs, does  
not come with technical support or warranty protection. Consumers 
also aren't eligible for software upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits filed Friday were against companies in Tampa,  
Orlando, Miami and eight other cities in central and South Florida, 
one of the company's largest anti-piracy initiatives in a single 
state, executives said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal law, the companies could be liable for as much as  
$100,000 for each instance of copyright infringement, said Pam 
Salzer, a spokeswoman for the company's east region. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft isn't able to estimate how much software piracy costs  
the company, but Salzer estimated it's a $2 billion-a-year problem 
for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Its impact is felt even in Latin America, according to Tony  
Viera, a Microsoft attorney in charge of anti-piracy for that 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	Two leads for the Florida lawsuits came from Chile and Peru,  
Viera said, adding that much illegal software goes overseas from 
Miami, Texas and California. 
</P>
<P>
	Two companies in Florida also are being investigated by police.  
</P>
<P>
	Felix and Marta Smud, who were arrested in Tampa and had their  
home searched Monday, were selling counterfeit Microsoft software 
for $65 apiece from their home-based company, said detective Bill 
Todd. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair were charged with conspiracy and distribution of  
illegal software, allegedly shipped the counterfeit products 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Department of Law Enforcement also searched Proline  
Technologies of Clearwater on Tuesday and seized 100 disks, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has filed more than 100 lawsuits within the last year  
in cities across the nation, including New York, New Jersey, 
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, Maryland, California, Chicago, 
Minnesota and Alabama.

<HEADLINE> Safety of Khmer Official Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- A former secret police chief for  
Cambodia's Khmer Rouge could be in danger from ex-comrades afraid 
he may testify against them, human rights activists said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Duch, who is known by one name and was the director of a Khmer  
Rouge torture center, is important not only because of his own 
crimes -- but also because he could be a key witness in the effort 
to bring other Khmer Rouge leaders to justice for their genocidal 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amnesty International fears that he may be killed to silence  
him, which would be a grave setback to moves to ensure 
accountability and an end to impunity for Khmer Rouge leaders,'' 
said a statement issued by the London-based human rights group. 
</P>
<P>
	Duch, 56, disappeared when the Khmer Rouge were toppled in 1979.  
Long presumed dead, Duch (pronounced dookh') was recently found 
living in western Cambodia where he had been working for aid 
organizations. He was recognized by a British free-lance 
photographer on an unrelated assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has urged him to turn himself in, but it was  
unclear whether he would do so or whether he would be arrested if 
he does not. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published Thursday in the Far Eastern Economic  
Review, a Hong Kong-based weekly, Duch admits his identity. He also 
accepts blame for the deaths of the more than 14,000 men, women and 
children who were tortured at Tuol Sleng, the Phnom Penh high 
school the Khmer Rouge transformed into an interrogation prison. 
Only seven prisoners survived. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is such an important witness. He has to be protected and  
secured,'' said Youk Chhang, director of the Cambodia Genocide 
Documentation Center, which collects evidence of Khmer Rouge 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1.7 million Cambodians out of a population of 7.9  
million were murdered, tortured, starved or worked to death in the 
three years, nine months the communist Khmer Rouge were in power. 
</P>
<P>
	Duch's emergence could increase pressure on Prime Minister Hun  
Sen to bring Khmer Rouge leaders to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one senior Khmer Rouge figure, hard-line general Ta Mok, is  
in custody awaiting trial. Most other leaders are living in freedom 
in exchange for making peace with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Ngin Sam An, the military investigating judge working on Ta  
Mok's case, also expressed concerns for Duch's safety, calling him 
an ``important witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duch -- born Kang Kek Ieu in 1942 -- headed the ``Santebal'' or  
internal security organization, and was the director of Tuol Sleng, 
where victims were chained to beds and tortured to force false 
``confessions'' -- often to spying for the United States and Vietnam 
-- and then executed in a field outside the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Duch's signature and detailed comments appear on hundreds of  
documents, some ordering electric shock, pulling out of toenails, 
submersion in water and other gruesome torture methods. 
</P>
<P>
	After fleeing Phnom Penh in 1979, Duch told the magazine, he  
spent time with the guerrillas in the jungle, taught in China, and 
after returning to Cambodia, left the Khmer Rouge in January 1992 
and resumed his original profession, teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	He converted to Christianity in 1993 and worked with various  
international aid organizations that were unaware of his identity.

<HEADLINE> FCC Approves Radio Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission on  
Thursday approved Clear Channel Communications Inc.'s $3.8 billion 
acquisition of Jacor Communications Inc., provided the companies 
sell 18 radio stations in four cities to preserve competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's action mirrors an agreement between the companies and  
the Justice Department, which cleared the deal last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's antitrust division had contended the original  
deal would have significantly reduced competition for radio 
advertising in Cleveland and Dayton, Ohio; Louisville, Ky.; and 
Tampa, Fla. With the divestiture, the number of competitors in 
those cities will either remain the same or increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC also granted Clear Channel a temporary break from  
federal ownership rules so that it may own TV and radio stations 
that serve the same markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Clear Channel, based in San Antonio, Texas, is the third-largest  
radio group in the country based on number of stations; Jacor is 
second. As of March 1998, Clear Channel operated more than 200 
stations in 48 cities. Jacor, based in Covington, Ky., operates 230 
stations in 59 metropolitan areas.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Generous to Gore, Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The presidential campaigns of both Vice  
President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush have raised more 
money from lawyers than from any other profession. 
</P>
<P>
	A study by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan  
research group, found that Gore raised $1.4 million from lawyers 
and Bush raised $747,550 during the first three months of 1999. 
Overall, Gore took in $8.9 million and Bush raised $7.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures include contributions from lawyers, other law firm  
employees and their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
	While individuals can give a maximum of $1,000 to a presidential  
candidate, many firms bundled contributions from their employees to 
increase their impact, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers from the Houston-based firm of Vinson &AMP; Elkins  
contributed a total of $172,400 to Bush's campaign. The money 
includes donations from spouses. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the biggest bundlers are law firms that also are  
registered to lobby on behalf of large corporations. Vinson &AMP; 
Elkins represents Bell Atlantic, Federal Express, and several Texas 
organizations, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies also pooled employees' contributions.  
</P>
<P>
	The highest total Gore received from a single company was  
$67,950 from employees of Ernst &AMP; Young, an accounting firm that 
also lobbies. Its lobbying clients include Intel, the Federation of 
American Health Systems and MCI, now MCI WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are active participants in politics on behalf of  
themselves and a wide range of clients,'' said Larry Makinson, 
executive director of the center. ``They want to make sure they're 
on the inside no matter who wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore campaign spokesman Roger Salazar said the bundled  
contributions represented a small percentage of the vice 
president's donors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think he's got support from people all across the country  
at all levels,'' Salazar said. ``They are all supporting the vice 
president for what he has to offer this country, which is the power 
of his ideas and his leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the donors gave  
``because he's done a great job as governor and they want him to be 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's only announced challenger for the Democratic presidential  
nomination, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, took in $646,150 
from lawyers. Overall, he raised $4.3 million during the first 
three months of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that some companies had divided loyalties.  
</P>
<P>
	Employees of the investment firm of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.,  
contributed a total of $45,500 to Gore, $15,000 to Bradley and 
$9,000 to Bush. Salomon Smith Barney employees gave $16,500 to Gore 
and $20,000 to Bradley. The figures also include spouse 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The center did not analyze the contributions to other  
presidential candidates who had not filed electronically.

<HEADLINE> AMP Restructuring To Cut Work Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- AMP Inc. plans to reduce its work force  
by 15 percent in an attempt to restore the $5.5 billion company to 
leadership in the market for connectors for electric and electronic 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The 8,000 job cuts announced Thursday, from a worldwide work  
force of 48,800, occur after more than a year of attempts to 
restructure the company, which has been hit hard by the Asian 
economic crisis and a failed expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bought earlier this month by Bermuda-based Tyco International  
Ltd., AMP hopes to save $1 billion over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, AMP shook up its top management and cut 4,800 jobs as  
part of a plan to save $400 million. But that effort failed because 
all those jobs were replaced within a few months, AMP president 
Jurgen Gromer said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest round of cuts include all those jobs that were  
replaced and an additional 3,200 positions. Earlier reports, later 
denied by Tyco, said Tyco was planning to cut 4,000 jobs at AMP on 
top of the job cuts announced by AMP last year. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the positions being eliminated will be in the  
United States, including 2,100 in Pennsylvania and 900 in North 
Carolina. Another 1,000 job cuts will be spread across 42 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada and Utah are the  
only states not affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the jobs are being eliminated by layoffs, with the rest  
through attrition and employee buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The company makes connectors for devices that are put into just  
about everything from refrigerators to missiles. It has 130 plants 
worldwide, including 68 in the United States. Pennsylvania has 40 
plants. North Carolina has 20 facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	No additional layoffs are planned and AMP's headquarters will  
remain in Harrisburg, where it has been for more than 50 years, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	AMP was founded in New Jersey in 1941 and was acquired for $12  
billion by Tyco. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite last year's restructuring effort, AMP's sales continued  
to decline while expenditures rose significantly, said spokeswoman 
Maryanne Kane. The latest restructuring will focus on improving 
customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	Gromer said the restructuring ``is designed to save the  
overwhelming majority of jobs at AMP.'' It will reduce costs and 
make the company a more efficient competitor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must be committed to producing, selling and delivering  
products to our customers in the most cost effective manner,'' 
Gromer said in a statement. ``This objective can be accomplished 
now that we have implemented our organizational plan to best meet 
our customers' needs.''

<HEADLINE> WNBA, Union Have Unresolved Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- WNBA labor negotiations are beginning to  
resemble those of their male counterparts. The women's league and 
its union can't seem to close the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the WNBA said there are still numerous issues to be  
worked out before an agreement can be reached, the union said only 
one issue remains outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what they're talking about,'' union spokesman  
Dan Wasserman said. ``The one issue we don't have a verbal 
agreement on is how many nonprofit, charitable events the players 
will do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players are required to make 22 appearances, eight of them  
commercial sponsor spots for which they are paid, four unpaid team 
appearances and up to 10 unpaid promotional appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is the players' association's right to do additional  
not-for-profit events using its logo. The WNBA owns marketing and 
licensing rights to the union logo. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is not allowed to use its logo for commercial purposes  
with the men or women, but is permitted to use it for up to eight 
not-for-profit events for the men. 
</P>
<P>
	But WNBA spokesman Mark Pray said, ``There are a number of  
unresolved issues, and we do not have a deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sides had two days of intensive negotiations before taking  
Wednesday off. They planned to meet again today. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an issue we shouldn't even be talking about,'' said  
Pam Wheeler, executive director of the union. ``Our position is 
that part of the draw and success of the WNBA has been the women 
participating and helping charitable events. The limit would 
prevent them from supporting these efforts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-week WNBA season is scheduled to begin June 10. The labor  
dispute forced the postponement of the April 27 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the sides reached a four-year agreement that would  
include a reopener option for the league or the union after three 
years, with both agreeing to no-lockout, no-strike clauses. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement calls for 5 percent increases a year for draft  
picks. Players from the folded ABL would be treated as rookies for 
salary purposes this year, but not subject to option clauses that 
teams hold on other rookies for their second seasons. Veterans 
would no longer be subject to such options. 
</P>
<P>
	An apparent agreement reached earlier this month fell apart last  
week when both sides claimed the other injected new terms at the 
last minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The union and league had agreed on a four-year deal that would  
increase minimum salaries from $15,000 to $30,000 for veterans and 
$25,000 for rookies. Those figures would increase to $40,000 and 
$30,000, respectively, by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefits package was to include year-round health and dental  
benefits, pension, maternity benefits and life insurance.

<HEADLINE> Senate Won't Stop Y2K Suit Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer shutdowns were the issue, but  
political meltdown was the problem as the Senate ran into more 
trouble today with legislation to control lawsuits arising from 
Year 2000 computer breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	On a 52-47, with all Democrats voting no, the Senate rejected an  
effort to move the Y2K toward a final vote. Sixty votes are needed 
to shut off debate in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats' opposition had little to do with the computer issue;  
what they want, before allowing the bill to go forward, is a 
promise from the Republican leadership that they will get a vote 
soon on Democratic priorities, including a raise in the minimum 
wage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Y2K problem is not going away, nor is it going to be  
postponed by petty partisan procedural wrangling,'' promised Sen. 
John McCain, R-Ariz., with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the chief 
sponsor. But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the 
bill was dead until Democrats agreed to let it go forward. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill grows out of widespread concern that disruptions caused  
by the Year 2000 computer glitch will result in the worst flood of 
lawsuits in American history. 
</P>
<P>
	It gives companies 90 days to fix computers before lawsuits go  
forward, encourages mediation, puts caps on some punitive damage 
awards and limits class-action lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	But any effort to limit lawsuits is a political minefield in  
Washington, and from the beginning consumer and attorney groups 
have accused the business community of using the Y2K issue as a 
first step toward reducing their liability for faulty products. 
</P>
<P>
	A fierce lobbying campaign has had the U.S. Chamber of Commerce  
leading the proponents while Democrats saw two of their biggest 
allies, the pro-bill high tech industry and anti-bill trial 
lawyers, pulling them in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-profile Y2K issue also generated a spate of similar  
bills, with a proposal by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin 
Hatch, R-Utah, competing for floor time with that of McCain, the 
Commerce Committee chairman, and Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., 
vice chairman of the Senate's special Y2K panel. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a presidential candidate, won out and Hatch, while  
insisting that he doesn't care whose name is on the final package 
has moved into the background. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd, whose support is crucial to winning Democratic votes, has  
used that leverage to win concessions from McCain. Dodd's changes 
include making punitive damage caps apply only to individuals and 
small businesses and modifying language that would have made 
business directors and officers exempt from Y2K liability. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite those compromises, floor progress was glacial because  
Democrats, in time-honored Senate maneuvering, threatened to use 
the Y2K issue as a vehicle to bring minimum wage and other 
Democratic priorities to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans defeated, 55-44 a move by Sen. Edward Kennedy,  
D-Mass., to attach a minimum wage increase amendment to the bill, 
but only after spending most of the day in sometimes rancorous 
exchanges on and off the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Withdraw this foolishness,'' a frustrated McCain said to  
Kennedy. McCain said he had ``begged for the last four days'' for 
someone to come forward with a relevant amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said the minimum wage was a national priority that  
Republicans are going to have to face and was unapologetic about 
his tactics. ``This place is just made for that kind of guerrilla 
operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the McCain-Wyden bill survives the Senate, it must still  
be reconciled with a bill working its way through the House that 
has yet to undergo the pro-consumer changes that Wyden and Dodd 
have put in the Senate bill. 
</P>
<P>
	And the administration has said that McCain-Wyden, in its  
present form, would face a presidential veto because it ``would 
reduce the liability these defendants may face, even if they do 
nothing'' to fix computer problems. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain urged American businesses to ``take careful note of the  
administration's absolute opposition to an effort which would solve 
this very, very serious issue.'' Chamber of Commerce President Tom 
Donohue said that in the end he didn't think either President 
Clinton or Vice President Al Gore, who has long associated himself 
with high-tech causes, could support a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is a pretty savvy guy,'' Donohue said. ``He will  
think about it carefully for the simple reason that this is 
something that affects the whole nation.'' 
</P>
<P>

hard just before dawn there Friday, as attacks centered on the 
headquarters of the Yugoslav army and the federal interior 
ministry. The attack occurred hours before special Russian mediator 
Viktor Chernomyrdin was due in Belgrade on a diplomatic shuttle 
mission to promote a peace plan for Yugoslavia. The Rev. Jesse 
Jackson also arrived Thursday in Belgrade on a mission to win 
freedom for three U.S. POWs held by Yugoslavia. He was expected to 
meet Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic and the head of 
the Serbian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Pavle, on Friday.

	Committee Approves Military Money  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee doubled President Clinton's  
request for monetary aid for the Yugoslavia conflict, approving 
$12.9 billion for the military effort. The money would cover the 
Balkans fighting and buttress Pentagon needs around the globe. The 
measure was approved by the House Appropriations Committee. House 
floor debate is expected next week. Separately, Defense Secretary 
William Cohen said he is sending 10 more Air Force B-52 bombers to 
the region.

	Russia Wants Nuclear Arms Upgrade  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin and the country's top  
security officials sought ways Thursday to maintain and upgrade 
Russia's nuclear arsenals despite the country's lack of money. 
After Yeltsin's meeting with his Security Council, council 
secretary Vladimir Putin said Russia would move ahead ``in the 
sensitive sphere'' of testing nuclear arsenals while honoring 
international agreements. Yeltsin told the council that nuclear 
forces remain the ``key element'' in Russia's military might, 
stressing that Russia must keep a sufficient number of nuclear 
weapons to guarantee its security.

	DENVER (AP) -- About 7,000 mourners bade farewell Thursday to the  
last of Columbine High's dead: 4-foot-11 football player Isaiah 
Shoels, who was two things the two student killers apparently 
hated, athletic and black. Shoels, 18, was buried in his graduation 
cap and gown. The three-hour funeral capped a week of mourning the 
13 victims of the April 20 shooting, which devastated the Denver 
suburb of Littleton and shocked the nation.

	Clinton: No Media Violence Summit  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton declined Thursday to limit  
any White House summit on youth violence to the entertainment 
industry's influence, saying the problem is much broader than 
Hollywood. Clinton said many factors could be behind a rash of 
school shootings. In an interview for NBC, Clinton said: ``I plan 
to bring some high-level folks from the entertainment industry and 
from other sectors of our society that I think can be active here 
together at the White House in the near future and then figure out 
how we can put together the elements of a national campaign.''

	Mrs. Clinton Urges Youth Care  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton called Thursday for  
better mental health services for young people and tighter control 
of their exposure to violent images on TV, the movies and video 
games. Mrs. Clinton called for those measures as part of a national 
campaign against youth violence in response to the school massacre 
in Littleton, Colo. The nation's new strategy should also include 
more restrictions on the availability of weapons, Mrs. Clinton 
said.

	Survey: Sex More Important Than Job  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sexual satisfaction is more important than job  
satisfaction, but less important than family, money and religion, 
according to a survey of adult Americans to be released Friday. The 
survey, designed to assess the attitudes of Americans toward sexual 
health, found that 82 percent of 500 adults ranked a satisfying sex 
life as important or very important. The survey results are to be 
released at a symposium on gender and human sexuality co-sponsored 
by Columbia University and the National Institutes of Health.

<HEADLINE> Marine Cable-Car Case Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot accused of getting rid  
of a videotape of a flight in which an Italian ski gondola cable 
was clipped, killing 20 people, tried to get back into the jet's 
cockpit after it landed, a sergeant testified today. 
</P>
<P>
	Master Sgt. Richard Henry told a court-martial that Capt.  
Richard Ashby, on trial for obstruction of justice and conspiracy, 
approached him once alone and a second time with someone he thought 
was a Marine commander. 
</P>
<P>
	``He identified himself as the pilot and stated he needed to get  
back in the aircraft to get a map and some other equipment,'' said 
Henry, who was the assistant fire chief at the NATO base in Aviano, 
Italy. Ashby was denied access both times. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is charged in the  
disappearance of a personal videotape his navigator shot during the 
Feb. 3, 1998, flight. He could be sentenced to 10 years in prison 
or dismissed from the service if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate jury acquitted Ashby last month of 20 counts of  
involuntary manslaughter stemming from the tragedy near Cavalese, 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy investigator Mark Fallon said the tape was important  
because it would have provided irrefutable evidence about what 
happened during the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Fallon also said he considered his work a criminal investigation  
from the day it began, on Feb. 4, 1998. A formal order for a 
criminal investigation wasn't issued until March 14. The dates were 
important to prosecutors and defense lawyers because the 
prosecution contends Ashby should have known an inquiry was 
underway when he helped get rid of the tape a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby has admitted taking the tape from the jet, leaving a blank  
one in its place, and later giving it to his navigator, Capt. 
Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y. But he maintains he did 
not intend to obstruct justice. Schweitzer pleaded guilty to 
obstruction of justice and conspiracy and was sentenced to 
dismissal from the Marines.

<HEADLINE> Francis Set to Return for Game 5 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- The Carolina Hurricanes acquired Ron  
Francis for just this kind of situation. Now, it appears they'll 
finally be able to use him. 
</P>
<P>
	The star center, out since Game 1 of the Hurricanes' Eastern  
Conference playoff series against the Boston Bruins because of a 
sprained right ankle, will return Friday night with the best-of-7 
series tied 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The return of Francis, who signed a $21 million contract during  
the offseason, to the Carolina lineup comes at an opportune time 
for the Hurricanes. They are coming off a 4-1 loss at Boston in 
Game 4 -- their worst game of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I wouldn't be checking on him,'' coach Paul Maurice  
said Thursday when asked if Francis would play his normal shifts, 
including on the power play. ``That's the way that works. If you 
get the green light that you want to go, you let it rip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis, who won two Stanley Cup titles with Pittsburgh during  
the early 1990s, got off to a slow start with his new team, but was 
Carolina's hottest offensive player in the second half of the 
season, scoring 36 points over the final 41 regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
	He injured his ankle in the first period of Game 1 a week ago at  
Greensboro, and other than trying to skate prior to sitting out 
Game 2, hadn't been on the ice until Thursday's optional workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had come to me prior to (Wednesday) night's game and said,  
`I'm close,' '' Maurice said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are at most three games left in this series, so there's  
not a lot of time to wait now. I'm happy we've been able to push 
this thing as far back as we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes played remarkably well despite the loss of  
Francis, one of the top playmakers and leaders in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went down early in the first game and it hurt,'' Carolina  
captain Keith Primeau said. ``People don't notice the 
behind-the-scenes stuff, just his knowledge and his ability to make 
adjustments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Glen Wesley said Carolina has missed Francis'  
versatility. 
</P>
<P>
	``He plays every key situation on the ice,'' Wesley said of  
Francis, the eighth-leading scorer in NHL history. ``It is going to 
be a big boost mentally for our club. Hopefully, there won't be any 
letdown just because he's back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice and the Carolina players appeared to be back in good  
spirits following Wednesday night's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Boston was confident it had seized the momentum in  
this physical, tight-checking series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put some chinks in their armor and maybe some questions in  
their minds,'' Boston's Anson Carter said. ``The momentum has 
shifted. (Wednesday's) game gave us a lot of relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Francis and Sami Kapanen (knee) will return for Carolina,  
Boston lost Landon Wilson for two to three weeks after a shoulder 
separation Wednesday night.

<HEADLINE> Oxford Health Plan Narrows Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP)-- Oxford Health Plans announced a  
narrower-than-expected first-quarter loss Thursday as the health 
maintenance organization significantly cut its medical expenses and 
raised premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford lost $4.6 million, or 6 cents per share, compared to a  
loss of $45.3 million, or 57 cents per share, in the same period a 
year ago. Results beat Wall Street forecasts of a 35 cent loss, 
according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Including a tax gain of $7.8 million related to a sale of  
Oxford's Medicaid business, the company made a profit of $14.3 
million. Oxford had lost money the six previous quarters following 
an unexpected loss midway through 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford's revenues fell to $1.06 billion in the first quarter  
from $1.21 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop results from Oxford leaving the New York and  
Pennsylvania Medicaid programs and the company's decision to no 
longer cover Medicare clients in several counties. Oxford now has 
1.69 million members, down from nearly 1.9 million members at the 
end of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford officials said they expect to have a profit for 1999,  
although the company still expects to have a loss in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to leaving several unprofitable Medicare and  
Medicaid markets, Oxford gained by increasing premiums an average 
of 9 percent. Nationally, most health plans hiked premiums between 
5 percent and 10 percent this year to keep up with rising medical 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	To contain health costs, Oxford this year required all of its  
small employers to institute a three-tiered pharmaceutical benefit, 
in which enrollees pay $10 for a generic drug, $15 for a preferred 
brand-name drug, and at least $30 for a non-preferred brand-name 
drug. In addition, Oxford renegotiated contracts with pharmacy 
benefit managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford also slashed fees to specialists.  
</P>
<P>
	The moves worked. Oxford spent 84.9 cents of each premium dollar  
on health costs in the first quarter, down sharply from 89.4 cents 
in the fourth quarter. That ratio is a key indicator of an HMO's 
fiscal health. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company is well along on following through with its  
turnaround plans,'' said Gary M. Frazier, an analyst with BT Alex 
Brown. ``Their medical management and recontracting efforts are 
taking hold with a lot more teeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford shares lost more than half their value after the company  
revealed in October 1997 it would report an unexpected 
third-quarter loss due to problems monitoring expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford shares, which rose earlier this week, fell $1 on Monday  
to $19.75 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.

<HEADLINE> Should Parents Pay for Kid's Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris were 17 and 18  
when they shot their classmates at Columbine High School, but to 
many people they were just kids in need of good parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Should their parents be held responsible for what they did? To  
what degree should any of us be held accountable for the actions of 
our children? 
</P>
<P>
	Some ethics experts are dismayed at how quickly many have blamed  
the Klebold and Harris families for last week's massacre that left 
15 dead, including the two young men. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm worried about all the moralistic claims people are  
making,'' said Margaret Farley, a Yale University professor of 
Christian ethics. ``It implies that we think parents have total 
control over their children's behavior and life, which isn't 
true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, ethicists said, we don't know enough about the Klebold  
and Harris families to draw conclusions. What we do know seems 
contradictory. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and neighbors paint a picture of caring parents who took  
their sons fishing and to Little League games. A family friend has 
said Harris was seeing a psychiatrist and taking medication, 
suggesting a troubled child but hardly an indication of neglectful 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	But how, many wonder, could the parents have failed to notice a  
sawed off shotgun barrel on the dresser of one boy's room, or 
bomb-making material lying in the open? Sheriff John Stone seemed 
to be voicing a common perspective when he said: ``The parents 
should have known.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Responsibility is both a legal matter and an ethical one.  
</P>
<P>
	At least 41 states, including Colorado, have laws that hold  
parents accountable for a variety of problems caused by their 
children, according to the National Conference of State 
Legislatures. The laws often require parents to participate in 
counseling or make restitution for their children's crimes, but 
carry no criminal penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 13 states, including Colorado, have laws making parents  
criminally responsible for failing to supervise delinquent 
children. It is rare for such charges to be brought. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know of no case in our country's history in which a parent  
has been convicted of a crime for the conduct committed by their 
children,'' said Martin Guggenheim, an expert in juvenile justice 
at New York University School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethical responsibility, however, is another matter.  
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Loconte, a fellow in religion and culture at the  
conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, is among those who 
believe parents bear the primary moral responsibility for their 
children's violent acts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is fundamentally a failure of parents to teach their  
children they are not at the center of the universe,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Chicago ethics professor Jean Bethke Elshtain said  
that the Littleton parents may be typical of many who have 
abdicated responsibility for their young. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of parents have given up their parenting to the wider  
culture. As long as kids aren't doing something obviously illegal, 
there's a hands off attitude in the name of tolerance,'' she said. 
``We need to think a lot about what happens when youth culture is a 
separate world (and) you need a visa to enter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She doesn't buy the bad seed theory that some kids are  
programmed from birth to commit crimes: ``It's a way of comforting 
ourselves: Kids are doomed for reasons we don't understand. But 
very few are doomed because of some brain disorder. Something 
happens along the way to make them hard to reach. They can't see a 
human being in another human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most ethicists interviewed were hesitant to blame parents for  
the behavior of their children, saying it reflects wider societal 
woes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are individuals responsible, let them be  
identified,'' said Stephen Tipton, an Emory University professor of 
the sociology of religion. ``But that doesn't free us from sharing 
responsibility for selling weapons and consuming cultural products 
that glorify violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loconte, for one, said if societal factors were the primary  
culprit, we'd be seeing more students like Klebold and Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents of other children,'' he said, ``seem quite capable of  
giving them the moral compass they need to navigate in a violent 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles McCoy, professor emeritus of theological ethics at  
Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley, Calif., deplored blaming 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he said, our culture should do a better job of  
preparing parents for the task of child rearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents,'' he said, ``are the last stronghold of amateurism.  
We need parental education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farley, the Yale ethicist, asked us not to be quick to judge the  
Klebold and Harris families. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine parents who were as good parents as they could  
possibly be and their child got involved in something like this,'' 
she said. ``Imagine the anguish they would feel and then add the 
blame of the whole society.''

<HEADLINE> HUD Working on Affordable Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo outlined a  
two-step strategy today to preserve thousands of federally 
subsidized housing units for the poor, the elderly and people with 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuomo said the Department of Housing and Urban Development will  
act immediately to boost payments to landlords participating in the 
program. Many payments were set years ago and are below current 
market levels. Increasing them will encourage landlords to stay in 
the program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	HUD says the increased payments will cost $30 million this  
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also will continue working with Congress to draft  
long-term, comprehensive solutions to preserving properties in the 
Section 8 housing subsidy program, Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important reform that will help protect families  
who need and deserve decent housing, at a fair cost to the American 
taxpayer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under one part of the 25-year-old Section 8 program, landlords  
agree to rent their properties to low-income people, who then pay 
about 30 percent of their income as rent. In return, the government 
pays the difference between what the tenant pays and what the 
apartment would cost on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	Landlords or HUD can choose not to renew when the contracts  
expire and most landlords continue in the program, Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
	But problems arise when landlords opt out in search of higher  
rents on the open market, leaving the poor to pay the higher rents 
or find other housing. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next five years alone, Cuomo said two-thirds of all such  
contracts will expire, affecting nearly 14,000 properties with 1 
million subsidized units. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 17,000 subsidized units at more than 300 properties  
left the program last year, according to a report on the issue 
released Thursday by HUD. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as ``project-based'' Section 8 because the subsidies are  
tied to specific rental units, the program now serves about 1.4 
million families nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Another form of the housing subsidy is known as ``tenant-based''  
Section 8. Renters receive vouchers they can take with them from 
unit to unit in search of housing. This portion of the program now 
serves about 1.5 million families. 
</P>
<P>
	Several bills to address the situation are pending in Congress.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, at a Senate housing subcommittee hearing,  
congressional auditors said the system HUD uses to track nearly $6 
billion in funds for four block-grant programs ``does not ensure 
that the programs' objectives are being met and that grantees are 
managing their funds appropriately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, the auditing branch of Congress,  
said a computerized information system is ``fraught with major 
design flaws'' and that the department's on-site monitoring of 
grant recipients was ``inadequate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cardell Cooper, who oversees administration of the grants as the  
assistant HUD secretary for community planning and development, 
acknowledged problems with the system and said he had set a Sept. 
30 deadline for making corrections.

<HEADLINE>  Police Link Girlfriend to 3 Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- An 18-year-old student who authorities  
say bought three of the four guns used in the Columbine High School 
massacre may face more questioning as investigators chase a wider 
conspiracy beyond Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have said that Robyn Anderson, Klebold's girlfriend,  
is not a suspect but a witness to the April 20 rampage. Twelve 
students and a teacher were killed before student assailants 
Klebold and Harris shot themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson, who attended the prom with Klebold days before the  
shootings, is just one of 600-plus leads being pursued in 
Colorado's largest-ever criminal probe. Detectives said they had 
``high hopes'' for future arrests, though no one has been formally 
labeled a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of those 600 could throw anybody back into the focus of  
the investigation,'' Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Steve 
Davis said. ``We're conducting this investigation as if there are 
more suspects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners drained by a week of funerals turned today to the final  
service for the Columbine victims. Witnesses say the gunmen killed 
Isaiah Shoels, 18, because he was black. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, hiding their arsenal under black  
trench coats, also wounded 23 people and left more than 50 bombs at 
the school and in their homes. Diaries show the plot had been 
planned for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, authorities confirmed that Ms. Anderson bought two  
shotguns and a rifle last fall. A semiautomatic TEC DC-9 handgun 
used in the attack has not yet been traced. 
</P>
<P>
	``She did buy the long guns,'' Davis said. ``Did she supply the  
weapons to them with some idea of what they were planning to do 
with them? That's still one of the major things we want to find 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Ms. Anderson bought the shotguns and rifle  
after her 18th birthday in November. Investigators said at least 
one was bought at a gun show. Federal law allows persons 18 years 
of age to buy rifles and shotguns, but not handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeated efforts to reach Ms. Anderson at home and by phone for  
comment have been unsuccessful. Investigators say she has retained 
an attorney and has been cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
	Anguished by the bloodshed at Columbine, people across the  
country are talking about school safety, parental responsibility, 
gun control and violence in movies, music and video games. With 
Vice President Al Gore in attendance, cable network MSNBC staged a 
town meeting Wednesday night focusing on the shootings, and CNN 
planned its own tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack has also produced a disturbing series of copycat  
crimes, including Wednesday's shooting of two 17-year-old boys at a 
Taber, Alberta, high school. One of the boys died after a 
14-year-old boy walked into the school and opened fire, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, educators have increased security and at least a  
half-dozen law enforcement agencies have arrested kids accused of 
plotting weapons attacks at school. A number of school districts 
have banned trench coats. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same school district as Columbine, a phony bomb threat on  
Wednesday forced students to evacuate Pomona High School. No 
explosives were found. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wackos are coming out of the woodwork,'' said another  
sheriff's spokesman, Sgt. Jim Parr. ``A lot of sick people think 
this is something to emulate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the leads is the medical problem cited by the Marines  
Corps when it rejected Harris as a recruit just five days before 
the attack. Harris was rejected because he had been taking the 
antidepressant drug Luvox, The New York Times reported today, 
citing a Defense Department source. Luvox is often used to treat 
obsessive-compulsive disorder in children and adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they were interested in whether Harris'  
condition could be linked to the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``His acceptance or nonacceptance into the Marine Corps I don't

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Retreat / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures retreated Thursday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade amid concerns farmers will soon speed up 
the pace of planting record supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans saw early support from continued predictions  
by the National Weather Service that Midwest growing regions will 
see above-normal rainfall next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency for the second time this week has predicted  
widespread rain that could further delay fieldwork, but private 
forecasters continue to predict the weather will remain dry through 
at least Wednesday. That should give farmers plenty of time to 
proceed with fieldwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures slipped amid concern about the potential for a  
bumper winter wheat crop harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery was unchanged at $2.63 1/2 a bushel; July  
corn fell 3/4 cent to $2.18 3/4 a bushel; July oats fell 1/2 cent to 
$1.19 1/2 a bushel; July soybeans fell 5 1/4 cents to $4.84 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork bellies futures finished mostly lower on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while lean hogs were mostly higher. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell .82 cent to 62.75 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle fell .33 cent to 71.32 cents a pound; July lean hogs 
rose .02 cent to 59.97 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell .60 
cent to 58.95 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE>  Police Link Girlfriend to 3 Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- An 18-year-old student who authorities  
say bought three of the four guns used in the Columbine High School 
massacre may face more questioning as investigators chase a wider 
conspiracy beyond Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have said that Robyn Anderson, Klebold's girlfriend,  
is not a suspect but a witness to the April 20 rampage. Twelve 
students and a teacher were killed before student assailants 
Klebold and Harris shot themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson, who attended the prom with Klebold days before the  
shootings, is just one of 600-plus leads being pursued in 
Colorado's largest-ever criminal probe. Detectives said they had 
``high hopes'' for future arrests, though no one has been formally 
labeled a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of those 600 could throw anybody back into the focus of  
the investigation,'' Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Steve 
Davis said. ``We're conducting this investigation as if there are 
more suspects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners drained by a week of funerals turned today to the final  
service for the Columbine victims. Witnesses say the gunmen killed 
Isaiah Shoels, 18, because he was black. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, hiding their arsenal under black  
trench coats, also wounded 23 people and left more than 50 bombs at 
the school and in their homes. Diaries show the plot had been 
planned for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, authorities confirmed that Ms. Anderson bought two  
shotguns and a rifle last fall. A semiautomatic TEC DC-9 handgun 
used in the attack has not yet been traced. 
</P>
<P>
	``She did buy the long guns,'' Davis said. ``Did she supply the  
weapons to them with some idea of what they were planning to do 
with them? That's still one of the major things we want to find 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Ms. Anderson bought the shotguns and rifle  
after her 18th birthday in November. Investigators said at least 
one was bought at a gun show. Federal law allows persons 18 years 
of age to buy rifles and shotguns, but not handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeated efforts to reach Ms. Anderson at home and by phone for  
comment have been unsuccessful. Investigators say she has retained 
an attorney and has been cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
	Anguished by the bloodshed at Columbine, people across the  
country are talking about school safety, parental responsibility, 
gun control and violence in movies, music and video games. With 
Vice President Al Gore in attendance, cable network MSNBC staged a 
town meeting Wednesday night focusing on the shootings, and CNN 
planned its own tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack has also produced a disturbing series of copycat  
crimes, including Wednesday's shooting of two 17-year-old boys at a 
Taber, Alberta, high school. One of the boys died after a 
14-year-old boy walked into the school and opened fire, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, educators have increased security and at least a  
half-dozen law enforcement agencies have arrested kids accused of 
plotting weapons attacks at school. A number of school districts 
have banned trench coats. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same school district as Columbine, a phony bomb threat on  
Wednesday forced students to evacuate Pomona High School. No 
explosives were found. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wackos are coming out of the woodwork,'' said another  
sheriff's spokesman, Sgt. Jim Parr. ``A lot of sick people think 
this is something to emulate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the leads is the medical problem cited by the Marines  
Corps when it rejected Harris as a recruit just five days before 
the attack. Harris was rejected because he had been taking the 
antidepressant drug Luvox, The New York Times reported today, 
citing a Defense Department source. Luvox is often used to treat 
obsessive-compulsive disorder in children and adolescents. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Mexico Regulators Ax Coke's Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's antitrust agency is expected to  
announce today that it has ruled against Coca-Cola Co.'s plans to 
sell the soft drink brands of Cadbury Schweppes PLC in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't received a formal notification, but we know that  
the agency has ruled against the purchase of the Cadbury Schweppes 
brands in Mexico,'' said Rodrigo Calderon, vice president of 
corporate relations at Coca-Cola Export Corp. in Mexico City, late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola announced in December a $1.85 billion deal that gives  
it rights in 120 countries outside the United States to sell 
Cadbury Schweppes soft-drink brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico is one of Coca-Cola's largest markets and has been one of  
Coke's growth leaders, with sales up 13 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Manuel Sandoval, spokesman of Mexico's Federal Competition  
Commission, or CFC, said the agency's commissioners have ruled on 
the issue and the decision would be announced today. He declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Calderon said Coca-Cola can request a review.  
</P>
<P>
	In Mexico, Cadbury Schweppes sells brands such as Penafiel  
mineral water, Canada Dry ginger ale, Orange Crush and 
apple-flavored soft-drinks Extra Poma and Balseca. 
</P>
<P>
	Calderon said Coca-Cola holds a 67 percent share of Mexico's  
soft drink market. If the CFC awards rights to market Cadbury 
Schweppes brands in the country, Coca-Cola's market share would 
rise to about 71 percent, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling is one of several setbacks to Coca-Cola in recent  
weeks. Similar antitrust decisions were taken in other markets, 
such as Australia and Belgium.

<HEADLINE> 'Ally McBeal' Bolts on Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Actress Calista Flockhart doesn't want to talk  
about weighty topics, so the ``Today'' show doesn't want to talk to 
her at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The star of Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' backed out of a long-scheduled  
interview with the NBC morning show when its producers refused a 
request not to talk about her weight. The ultra-thin actress has 
denied rumors that she has an eating disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never agree to restrictions on interviews,'' Allison  
Gollust, a ``Today'' spokeswoman, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Flockhart had been booked on ``Today'' for next Monday to  
promote her new movie. She also has appearances planned for next 
week on CBS's ``Late Show'' with David Letterman and on ``The Rosie 
O'Donnell Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flockhart has answered questions several times about her weight  
``and it always comes out the same,'' said Pat Kingsley, her 
publicist. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just said `enough is enough,''' she said. ``We're fed up  
with it and we don't want to put her out there anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Letterman and O'Donnell shows are different because they are  
entertainment, not news, shows, she said. Both shows readily agreed 
not to talk about her weight, even volunteering to stay away from 
the topic, Kingsley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The `Rosie O'Donnell Show' is a talent-friendly show,''  
spokeswoman Laura Mandel said, ``and if guests don't want to 
discuss something, it's OK with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Letterman was not immediately available for  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Brown &AMP; Williamson Seeks Safe Smoke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. is  
experimenting with a curing process that removes a potentially 
cancerous substance from a cigarette while preserving the taste. 
</P>
<P>
	The process was developed by a small Richmond, Va., firm to  
remove some of the nitrosamines from tobacco. Nitrosamines, which 
are related to nicotine, cause cancer in laboratory animals. They 
are among dozens of carcinogens in cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. announced it has  
developed a curing method that could dramatically reduce 
nitrosamines. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Burger, RJR's senior vice president of research and  
development, called the advancement a ``breakthrough in the 
company's ongoing efforts to reduce the toxins in cigarette 
smoke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to say the curing process would produce a safer  
cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brown &AMP; Williamson said its advances were the latest in  
efforts to make cigarettes safer. ``It's something we've been 
trying to do for 40 years,'' spokesman Mark Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Williamson, the nation's third-largest tobacco company,  
puts out the Kool, Lucky Strike and Viceroy brands. 
</P>
<P>
	The company bought 100,000 pounds of tobacco last year that was  
cured with the new process. It hopes to buy 1.2 million pounds this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul L. Perito, a spokesman for Star Scientific, which began as  
a small manufacturer of discount cigarettes, said the process will 
be licensed to other cigarette manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The taste issue is a stumbling block, said Harold Burton, a  
University of Kentucky chemist who has been assisting Star 
Scientific. 
</P>
<P>
	R.J. Reynolds, maker of Winston and Camel cigarettes, planned to  
study ways to use the tobacco in all of its brands if further 
testing confirms the results, Burger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco farmers, already wracked by upheavals in their sales  
markets by tobacco company settlements of health claims, would end 
up having to pay more to use the curing process, Burton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jim Roach, a Midway, Ky., physician and anti-smoking  
activist, said the effort to improve cigarettes is laudable but 
suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are at least 34 cancer-causing agents in cigarettes,''  
Roach said. ``Removing one will help and I'm glad they're doing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ulterior motive is to say cigarettes are safer and you  
don't have to stop. That's the message that we've got to be careful 
does not get transmitted,'' Roach said.

<HEADLINE> Patriots, Conn. Discuss Move Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Despite environmental concerns that could  
delay stadium construction and a counteroffer from Massachusetts, 
New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft remains committed to moving 
his team to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraft and Connecticut Gov. John G. Rowland met for four hours  
Thursday night to discuss the state's plans to build the team a 
$380 million stadium on the Hartford waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowland said the state is making substantial progress toward  
meeting its commitment to finish the stadium by 2002, and is 
working with Kraft and the Patriots to convince NFL owners to vote 
in favor of the move. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal and the Patriots' goal is to open the 2002 season here  
in Hartford,'' Rowland said. ``As I've said so many times before, 
it will happen. Failure is not an option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe reported today that Kraft has received a report  
from consultants who say it is unlikely the stadium will be ready 
on time. There are several outstanding issues that could delay 
construction, including the contamination of the site, and delays 
in moving a steam plant off the land. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the governor nor Kraft would take any questions from  
reporters. Kraft did not say whether he believed that environmental 
problems with the stadium site could be resolved, or whether he 
would consider the new offer from Massachusetts if Connecticut 
fails to meet its deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal agreed to by Bay State leaders this week,  
Massachusetts would pay $70 million for infrastructure supporting a 
new stadium in Foxboro, Mass., the team's current home. But Kraft 
would have to pay for the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal has always been to play in a new stadium in downtown  
Hartford in 2002,'' Kraft said. ``That was the spirit of our 
discussion tonight and as usual it was very frank and candid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL is scheduled to vote on whether to approve the Patriots  
move from Foxboro on May 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the next five weeks, we're going to continue working  
together because it's our mutual goal to convince the NFL ownership 
that the deal we struck last fall was in the best interest of the 
team, the fans and all those involved, including the league,'' 
Rowland said. ``We're confident we can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci, who was traveling in  
California, was not surprised at the comments from Kraft and 
Rowland, Cellucci spokeswoman Ilene Hoffer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly wasn't unexpected that the Patriots and Hartford  
would continue their talks,'' she said. ``We would expect Kraft 
would want to keep all his options open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact remains that Massachusetts has a lot to offer that  
Connecticut just can't match. That is the loyal fan base and the 
media market,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Connecticut Attorney General Richard  
Blumenthal said he was preparing to sue the NFL for actively 
promoting Massachusetts' bid to keep the Patriots, despite the 
agreement Kraft signed to come to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit would charge the NFL with interfering with the  
agreement between Connecticut and Kraft, and with restraining 
competition, by trying to block a move by the Patriots to Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFL is proactively intervening to lure the team away from  
an agreement the team has with Connecticut,'' Blumenthal said. ``We 
could sue for hundreds of millions of dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal referred to a visit by NFL commissioner Paul  
Tagliabue to Boston last week. Tuesday night, Bay State legislative 
leaders announced a plan to keep the team. 
</P>
<P>
	During his visit, Tagliabue said that Massachusetts was the  
``optimal'' home for the Patriots. NFL officials have said in the 
past that they prefer that the team stay in Boston, the sixth 
largest television market in the country. Hartford is 27th. 
</P>
<P>
	``That kind of proactive intervention to interfere in an  
established agreement is what may violate the law,'' Blumenthal 
said. Kraft signed an agreement with Connecticut on Feb. 12.

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Group Tries for Pens Save </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux met with the Civic Arena's  
landlord Thursday in a critical phase of his bid to buy the 
bankrupt Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a good exchange of information,'' said Chuck Greenberg,  
an attorney for Lemieux, who declined to elaborate further on the 
talks with Philadelphia-based SMG. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Shapira, a Pittsburgh attorney representing SMG, said the  
sides agreed to meet a second time. A hearing on Lemieux's plan to 
buy the Penguins is scheduled for Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Lemieux, the greatest player in team history and a  
Hall of Famer, met with the brother and attorney for potential 
investor Mark Cuban, the chairman of Broadcast.com, an Internet 
broadcasting company. Brian Cuban reported that talks were 
productive, according to the brothers' attorney, Mark Haak. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban, whose company is about to be sold to Yahoo for $6.08  
billion, has the resources to purchase the team on his own, Haak 
said. But Cuban said earlier this week he would be willing to have 
a partner. 
</P>
<P>
	A new lease with SMG, which manages the publicly owned Civic  
Arena, is crucial to Lemieux's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins officials have blamed the team's expensive lease at the  
Civic Arena, the oldest facility in the NHL, for helping push the 
team into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	The lease is worth $6 million to $7 million annually. Under its  
terms, the Penguins are committed to playing at the arena until 
2007. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's plan, the only one filed so far, calls for a new arena  
by 2004. It also calls for payments to SMG to be lowered to 
$500,000 a year.

<HEADLINE> Court Blocks Twins Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota's Supreme Court upheld  
baseball's antitrust exemption, likely curbing a state 
investigation into whether the sport's officials conspired to get 
public money for a ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We conclude that the sale and relocation of a baseball  
franchise ... is an integral part of the business of professional 
baseball and falls within the exemption,'' Justice Paul H. Anderson 
wrote Thursday in the court's 6-0 decision. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote that the exemption ``may be an aberration'' carved out  
by the U.S. Supreme Court, but that court should retain the 
exclusive privilege of overruling its own decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said neither the Twins nor major league baseball could  
be forced to comply with an investigation begun by former Attorney 
General Hubert H. Humphrey III and continued by Attorney General 
Mike Hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed with the Minnesota Supreme Court's  
decision,'' Hatch said. ``Currently, we are taking a careful review 
of the decision to determine whether to ask the United States 
Supreme Court to review the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humphrey had asked for papers going back to 1959 to determine  
whether baseball officials illegally conspired by threatening to 
move franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins and baseball argued their conduct was exempt from  
state and federal antitrust laws because the U.S. Supreme Court has 
held baseball was not interstate commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hold that the conduct of the Twins being investigated by  
the attorney general is exempt from Minnesota, as well as federal, 
antitrust laws,'' Anderson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision will allow the Twins to turn all their attention  
to the important task of seeking a new stadium in the Minneapolis 
area,'' baseball commissioner Bud Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1997, Twins owner Carl Pohlad announced that he had  
signed a letter of intent to sell the Twins to a group led by North 
Carolina businessman Don Beaver, who was likely to move the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale was contingent on the Legislature's refusal to  
authorize public funding for a new baseball stadium by Nov. 30, 
1997. The Legislature rejected all stadium bills introduced in a 
special session shortly before the deadline, but the sale never 
went through. 
</P>
<P>
	Within days of the announcement of the proposed sale, a  
delegation from Minnesota, including then-Gov. Arne Carlson and key 
legislators, traveled to Milwaukee to talk with Selig, then the 
acting commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig said that if a publicly funded stadium was not authorized  
and built, the other baseball owners would approve the Twins' move. 
The Legislature subsequently rejected all stadium bills introduced 
in the special session. Humphrey began the investigation in 
December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	A Ramsey County District Court judge last year rejected the  
Twins' argument and ordered the team to comply with the 
investigation, but only as far back as 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The order covered all documents related to revenue sharing,  
potential relocation and sale of major league baseball teams, and 
the construction and methods for obtaining new ballparks in 
Minnesota and elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Salvaged Architecture Goes On Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The late Jorge Epstein gave his son Norman this  
advice: ``The worst thing you can do is to have great things and 
let them slide through your fingers before you know it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jorge Epstein didn't let much get away.  
</P>
<P>
	Five months after his death at 85, the sale of his mammoth  
collection of salvaged architectural treasures was to begin today 
at Old Mansions Inc., the old factory where he stockpiled fireplace 
mantels, leaded glass windows, plaster ornaments and all manner of 
bric-a-brac. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, Epstein scavenged a million artifacts. On  
Wednesday, workers feverishly stacked wrought iron fences, 
Victorian doors, Greek Revival columns and dusty old paintings in 
anticipation of the hordes expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole place makes your eyes pop,'' said Mary Westcott, an  
associate at Kaminski Auctioneers, which is liquidating the 
collection in a sale expected to last about five months. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a small percentage of the objects have been priced. A pine  
lintel from a Colonial home was marked $300. Four black-and-silver 
art deco cornices were priced at $75 apiece. A framed watercolor by 
an unknown artist had a sticker with $175 scrawled on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He couldn't see how people couldn't save the stuff,'' said  
Norman Epstein, standing next to a dusty stack of books containing 
municipal records that hadn't been moved from its perch in 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we started taking stuff,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	And selling it.  
</P>
<P>
	Epstein sold the Brooklyn Museum of Art its Sculpture Garden. He  
sold a Colonial tavern to the Smithsonian Institution. He sold a 
sermon given on the first day of American independence, his son 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1932, Epstein was a struggling Boston jeweler. One day a  
woman dressed in mourning walked into his store and told him she 
wanted to sell a silver spoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Epstein told her the spoon was gold.  
</P>
<P>
	``She said, `I had a whole service of 12, and I've been selling  
it off to Boston jewelry stores,''' said his son. ``No one had told 
her it was gold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, who turned out to be the widow of the president of  
the First National Bank of Boston, asked Epstein to sell the rest 
of the estate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honesty made my father rich,'' said Norman Epstein.

<HEADLINE> Government To Relax 'Dolphin-Safe' Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It may say ``dolphin safe'' on the can of  
tuna, but then -- maybe it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, acting at the direction of Congress,  
is giving the go-ahead for processors and canners to use tuna 
caught by using large, encircling nets that also can snare dolphins 
and still label it ``dolphin safe'' in retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
	A formal announcement of the dolphin-tuna decision was to be  
made by the Commerce Department today, according to administration 
and congressional sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of encircling nets to catch tuna was once said to kill  
more than 100,000 dolphins a year, prompting an import ban in 1990 
of tuna caught by encirclement. That, in turn resulted in all tuna 
sold in the United States to be marked ``dolphin safe'' -- a label 
that has been around for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The dolphin death toll has declined dramatically to less than  
3,000 a year, and Congress in 1997 said the entire issue should be 
re-examined. It lifted the import embargo and directed a review on 
whether there should be a change in how the label is used. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department was to announce today that it had found  
``insufficient evidence'' to conclude tuna encirclement has a 
significant impact on dolphins, officials said. As a result, the 
label may be used, as directed by Congress, on all tuna, no matter 
how it is caught. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how much impact the change would have on grocery  
shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	Wary of a possible consumer backlash and already facing a glut  
in the tuna market, the three major tuna processors -- Star-Kist, 
Chicken of the Sea and Bumble Bee -- have said they would continue 
using only tuna caught by methods other than encirclement. The 
three processors share about 90 percent of the U.S. tuna market. 
</P>
<P>
	But some conservationists say the change may allow some  
store-brand tuna to carry a ``dolphin safe'' label no matter how 
the fish is caught and confuse consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will cheapen the label. It will confuse consumers,'' said  
John Fitzgerald, who as an environmental lobbyist helped write the 
legislation in 1990 that led to the ``dolphin safe'' labeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's consumer fraud and a death warrant for thousands of  
dolphin,'' insisted David Phillips, director of Earth Island 
Institute's marine mammal project near San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Marine Fisheries Service under the 1997 law is  
required to pursue further studies and make another review in 2002 
on whether the use of large encircling nets to catch tuna causes 
``significant adverse impact'' on dolphin that swim with tuna. 
</P>
<P>
	If they find the impact is significant, the definition of  
``dolphin safe'' may once again change, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile the conservation community is anything but united on  
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Some environmentalists as well as lawmakers cite statistics that  
show the number of dolphins has not increased, although mortalities 
have declined sharply over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., wrote Commerce Secretary William  
Daley earlier this week, urging that the ``dolphin label'' remain 
as is ``until we ensure that dolphin stocks are actually 
recovering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the lifting of the import embargo and change in labeling  
criteria has had support from such groups as Greenpeace, the Center 
for Marine Conservation and the Environmental Defense Fund. They 
all argue that the usefulness of the U.S. import ban has passed and 
that further restrictions -- including the current definition of the 
label -- only blocks international action to protect the dolphin and 
other marine life. 
</P>
<P>
	They say that the ``dolphin safe'' label as it now is defined  
stands in the way of international action because other countries, 
including Mexico, will not participate in dolphin protection unless 
the U.S. market is reopened without restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Mourners Bury Last Victim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Detectives have traced guns used in the Columbine  
High School massacre, seized dozens of bombs and recovered dramatic 
video evidence of the nightmare inside. 
</P>
<P>
	But 11 days after the attack, the only person who has been  
arrested is a hardware store clerk accused of concocting a story 
about selling the gunmen material used in their bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators had hoped for more as they seek evidence that  
others helped Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold plot their April 20 
assault on the Littleton school. The gunmen killed 12 students and 
a teacher before committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials questioned a man who may have supplied the  
semiautomatic pistol used by one of the young attackers. But 
authorities said no arrests were imminent -- a sharp about-face from 
earlier suggestions that the man would be arrested ``in a day or 
two'' after negotiating terms of his surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	Others have been questioned, but prosecutor Mark Pautler  
declined to label them as suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not a good idea to let people know ahead of time that we  
are going to arrest them,'' he said Thursday. ``They have a 
tendency to disappear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms  
earlier this week visited the Blackjack Pizza shop where Harris, 
18, and Klebold, 17, worked. The agents were investigating whether 
a pizza deliveryman acted as a middleman between the students and 
the gun seller. The ATF and pizza shop managers declined to discuss 
the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Crime laboratory technicians are conducting ballistics tests to  
determine which guns fired the ammunition that killed each of the 
13 victims. If bullets fired by the paramilitary-style TEC DC-9 did 
not hit anyone, the gun seller may only face charges of illegal gun 
peddling rather than being implicated in the murders. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Klebold's prom date, Robyn Anderson, 18,  
bought three of the four weapons -- two rifles and a shotgun -- used 
in the massacre. Authorities insist she, too, is only a witness. 
Under Colorado law, an 18-year old without a felony record can 
legally furnish minors with rifles and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson has made no public comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also said they have not formally interviewed the  
killers' parents, blaming scheduling problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to set it up now,'' Pautler told The Washington  
Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sheriff John Stone said investigators who examined  
inventory records and receipts at a hardware store have concluded 
that Gary Sowell, 50, lied about selling the youths propane tanks, 
wire, screws and other materials used to make the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sowell was charged Thursday with making a false report to  
authorities, a misdemeanor, and booked in the Jefferson County jail 
on $1,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe this will slow down some of these crackpot calls that  
we're getting,'' Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	As dozens of detectives chased more than 1,100 leads in  
Colorado's largest-ever criminal probe, heartbroken residents laid 
to rest the last of the massacre victims after a gospel-infused 
memorial to 18-year-old Isaiah Shoels. 
</P>
<P>
	Choir singers raised their hands skyward while belting out  
joyous praise. In between hymns, speakers mixed fond memories of 
the 4-foot-11 football player -- described as ``small in stature but 
large in heart'' -- with calls for societal change. 
</P>
<P>
	``When does this stop? When does it end?'' asked William  
Collins, Isaiah's grandfather. ``I'm tired of laying to rest 
politicians, engineers, athletes, musicians, artists, janitors and 
sanitation haulers who are robbed of reaching their potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shoels' father, Michael, said his son ``had two strikes against  
him'' in the minds of the gunmen: He was an athlete and he was 
black. Students said the gunmen were seeking jocks and singled 
Shoels out because of his race. 
</P>
<P>
	Speakers hoped Shoels' ceremony marked a turning point for a  
community desperate to move on. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the last piece. Now the healing begins,'' said the  
Rev. Larry Russell, the executive pastor at the Heritage Christian 
Center. ``I don't think the healing could begin until today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of parents also turned out Thursday evening for a tour  
of Chatfield Senior High, where most Columbine students will finish 
out the school year. They resume classes on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Vargo, whose 17-year-old daughter, Julie, was one of the  
last to get out of a choir room during the shootings, said he felt 
reassured about his daughter's safety after attending the one-hour 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned, they're doing a good job of making  
the kids feel comfortable,'' he said. He added, however, that his 
daughter remains worried about returning to school.

<HEADLINE> Moore Sees Poor Race at Nazareth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAZARETH, Pa. (AP) -- Although the Bosch Grand Prix has had many  
exciting battles, Greg Moore figures this year could be the Bore 
War. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally predict a very poor race,'' the FedEx Series  
points leader said. ``We won't be as stable, and we won't be as 
fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reason is a decision by sanctioning body CART to race the  
cars Sunday at Nazareth Speedway with wings designed for oval 
tracks far greater in length than its .946 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the changed wing package, there will be a lot less  
downforce,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was based on spring testing data. It's the first of  
three races this year for CART drivers on ovals measuring a mile or 
less. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore says track time is extremely important because the drivers  
are not certain what the cars will do with the new aerodynamic 
package. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to get out there and run with somebody,'' he said.  
``You've got to figure out how these things will handle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Canadian, chasing his sixth career victory and  
second this season, says everyone will be seeking a ``fine 
balance'' necessary to best get around the extremely flat track 
with a backstretch that runs downhill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Qualifying is going to be very important,'' he said. ``You've  
got to start up near the front. Passing is going to be difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will be a challenge, something Moore has never shied away  
from, not even at a difficult track like Nazareth. The picturesque 
layout in gently rolling hills just south of the Pocono Mountains 
is very narrow, with sharp turns. 
</P>
<P>
	But Moore proved he could handle it from the outset, finishing  
second in the Bosch Grand Prix as a rookie in 1996. It was just his 
fifth Champ Car race. 
</P>
<P>
	A year earlier, he dominated CART's Indy Lights developmental  
series, winning 10 of 12 races and seven poles. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the British Columbian thinks the lessons he has learned in  
his first three seasons in the big cars have primed him for a run 
at the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm as competitive as anyone,'' he said. ``We've shown that we  
can win on street courses, road courses and ovals. It's just a 
question of getting it set up right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore knows his first Nazareth Champ Car victory will have to  
come at the expense of a deep and talented field. Perhaps foremost 
among those he'll have to beat is hometown hero Michael Andretti. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Moore, he is concerned about the wings, and says restarts  
on cold tires could be perilous. Last year, even with the big 
wings, he spun on a restart and crashed out of a race he had 
dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we get some heat in the tires, it's going to be like  
running on ice,'' Andretti said. 
</P>
<P>
	To win, Moore also must outrun rookie sensation Juan Montoya,  
the Target-Chip Ganassi Racing replacement for two-time champion 
Alex Zanardi. He left for Formula One after winning his second 
straight title. 
</P>
<P>
	It took Montoya, a 23-year-old Colombian, just three races to  
win for the first time. His victory came April 18, on the city 
street course in Long Beach, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, he makes his first start on a short oval. The 1998  
Formula 300 champion is confident, for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty happy,'' said Montoya, the fastest driver in  
testing this spring at Nazareth. ``I like the circuit, and I find 
it very challenging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll get no argument from Andretti, who will try to become the  
first three-time winner of the race. He prevailed in a magnificent 
contest with Paul Tracy in 1996, then lost an even better one to 
Tracy in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a special place for me,'' said Andretti, seeking to add  
to his series-best career record of 36 victories. ``You always want 
to do well in front of your family and friends.''

<HEADLINE> Court Reinstates Fraud Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court reinstated a  
securities fraud suit by stockholders of a battery technology 
company Thursday and said a magazine article critical of the 
company did not contain reasons to suspect fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Valence Technology Inc. and several of its officers were sued in  
May 1994 after its stock tumbled when it announced it couldn't 
fulfill a $100 million contract. The company was then based in San 
Jose; it has since moved to Henderson, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge James Ware dismissed the suit because it was  
filed more than a year after a February 1993 Forbes magazine 
article that said the company's touted new battery was untested in 
the real world. 
</P>
<P>
	The article also said Valence had a history of insiders and  
underwriters making money while journalists accepted the company's 
``boastful pronouncements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ware ruled that the article put stockholders on notice of the  
problems that ultimately led to the suit, and therefore started the 
one-year period in which the suit could be filed. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the article  
contained no claim of fraud and ``would not have led a reasonable 
investor to investigate the possibility of fraud.'' The court noted 
the company's stock price recovered after dipping briefly following 
publication of the article. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it was not deciding whether a securities fraud  
suit had to be filed within a year of the disclosure of facts that 
should cause a reasonable investor to suspect fraud, or only within 
a year of the time the investor learns of the alleged fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	By either standard, the suit was filed on time and should be  
allowed to proceed, Judge Betty Fletcher said in a 3-0 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert P. Feldman, lawyer for Valence and three of its officers,  
said the company would study the ruling and decide whether to 
appeal. ``If not, we'll win in the trial court,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed as a proposed class action on behalf of  
everyone who bought company stock between May 1992, when it 
announced new battery technology and made an initial public 
offering, and August 1994, when it abandoned the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Valence signed a $100 million contract with Motorola in December  
1992 to use Valence's new solid electrolyte rechargeable batteries 
in cellular telephones. Valence raised $167 million in a series of 
public offerings and saw its stock climb to $20 a share in December 
1993, after a drop to $12.50 following the Forbes article. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock sank to $5.25 after Valence announced in May 1994 that  
it could not meet Motorola's specifications, and to $3.37 1/2 in 
August 1994 when the new battery was scuttled. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Berry vs. Valence Technology, 97-17346.

<HEADLINE> Boy, 17, Sentenced for 5 Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLNEY, Ill. (AP) -- A 17-year-old boy who admitted using a hammer  
to kill five people, including three children, was sentenced today 
to life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Churchill of Noble, Ill. was 16 in February 1998  
when he killed his half-brother, Jonathan Lloyd, along with Lloyd's 
35-year-old girlfriend and her three young children -- ages 12, 10 
and 6 -- at their rural Richland County home. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill also admitted having sex with one of the children as  
she lay dying, and sexually molesting two other bodies. He then 
bathed before leaving the house with cash, cigarettes, alcohol and 
compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill was not eligible for the death penalty because of his  
age. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will live out the rest of his life in prison, which is a  
fitting punishment for someone who would commit such violent and 
senseless crimes,'' said State's Attorney David Rands. 
</P>
<P>
	In a videotaped statement played at his trial, Churchill told  
police that he had fantasized about killing Lloyd for more than a 
year to release pent-up aggression. He said he ``acted out a little 
anger'' on the others on impulse because they teased him, and 
because one of the children broke one of his CDs.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Nears Hockey Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky is one step closer to the Hockey  
Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall's selection committee waived the standard three-year  
waiting period for Gretzky on Thursday. It's now up to the board of 
directors, which has the final say on induction matters, to do the 
same at a June 14 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-quarters of the selection committee's votes were needed  
Thursday. The vote was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's nomination for induction will officially be discussed  
at a meeting June 23. A news conference announcing this year's 
nominees will follow. The next induction ceremony is Nov. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, whose remarkable 20-year NHL career ended April 18, is  
expected to become the 10th NHL player to be inducted without the 
customary three-year waiting period. He would join Dit Clapper 
(1947), Maurice Richard (1961), Ted Lindsay (1966), Red Kelly 
(1969), Terry Sawchuck (1971), Jean Beliveau (1972), Gordie Howe 
(1972), Bobby Orr (1979) and Mario Lemieux (1997). 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Gretzky retired holding 61 NHL records from a  
career that included 1,487 games, 894 goals and 1,963 assists. He 
played on four Stanley Cup-winning teams at Edmonton and had his 
No. 99 retired league-wide by commissioner Gary Bettman.

<HEADLINE> Two Leave Kentucky Basketball Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Kentucky became the latest school struck  
by a springtime rash of transfers when center Michael Bradley and 
guard Ryan Hogan decided to leave the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletics director C.M. Newton said the sudden defections came  
as a surprise and point out a problem that college basketball needs 
to address. 
</P>
<P>
	Newton said many of the transfers this spring were starters --  
like Bradley or Indiana's Luke Recker and Oklahoma's Ryan Humphrey 
-- or key reserves like Hogan or Chris Burgess at Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be when a young person transferred, it was  
generally because they were in over their head and chose to go to a 
program where they could play,'' said Newton, a former coach at 
Alabama and Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we're seeing a form of free agency. Guys for whatever  
reason might be unhappy, so they say they'll try another program. 
Where is the sense of team, the sense of loyalty to a program, the 
concern for others and the sense of responsibility?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's departure creates a potentially gaping hole at center  
for the Wildcats, who are still awaiting a decision by Bradley's 
backup, Jamaal Magloire, on whether he'll leave early for the NBA 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed that Mike and Ryan have decided to leave the  
University of Kentucky, but we wish them well in their future 
endeavors,'' coach Tubby Smith said. He was not available for 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Newton said that both players told him they thought it was in  
their best interests to transfer. Newton said the departures raise 
a ``fairness issue'' since they come so late in the spring 
recruiting season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing when you have any young man leave your  
program prematurely,'' he said. ``In this particular situation, 
it's some concern because of the timing of it. It's very late for 
us to be notified of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats, meanwhile, added one inside player Thursday when

<HEADLINE> Magnetic Strips on Mars Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The discovery of magnetic strips across the  
face of Mars suggests the barren planet once had geology like that 
of Earth, with a torrid interior spurting molten rock and massive 
plates drifting on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Instruments aboard the Mars Global Surveyor have detected  
magnetic striations that closely resemble the magnetic signature of 
crustal spreading and continental drift on the Earth, researchers 
report in a study to be published Friday in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	This may mean the very young Mars resembled the very young  
Earth, but that Mars ran out of its internal energy sources and 
became a geologically dead planet early in its history, said Norman 
F. Ness of the University of Delaware and co-author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``The data suggests that Mars was once magnetic and was far more  
similar to Earth's global magnetic field than had previously 
assumed,'' Ness said. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence of this magnetic field is frozen in rocks that were  
molten when the magnetic field existed. When the rocks hardened 
they retained the original magnetism and that now has been detected 
and mapped by the spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the present time there is no evidence of a global magnetic  
field on Mars,'' said Ness. ``That means the dynamo died and what 
is left is the memory of that dynamo, stored in the crustal rocks 
like a magnetic tape recording.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pattern of magnetic rock closely resembles the streaks that  
led scientists to discover on Earth that continents sit atop 
immense crustal plates that inch about the globe over millions of 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists previously believed that continental drift occurred  
only on Earth because studies had shown the process did not take 
place on Venus, the solar system planet nearest Earth's size, said 
Ness. 
</P>
<P>
	But the discovery of Martian magnetic striations suggests that  
Mars may also have had continent-sized plates that split apart on 
the surface of the planet and inched apart, pushed by the flow of 
magma bubbling up through crustal rifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ness said the energy that heated the rock apparently ran out  
within a few hundred million years and Mars became a geologically 
dead planet. The solar system, including the Earth and Mars, are 
thought to have formed 4 billion years ago to 4.5 billion years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicki L. Hansen, a Southern Methodist University geologist, said  
that the fate of Mars also awaits the Earth. She said that 
eventually Earth also will exhaust its internal energy and its 
molten core will cool. This will shut down the planet's magnetic 
field and allow radiation from the sun to strip away the Earth's 
atmosphere and water. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Mars went through at a very young age is what will occur  
on the Earth eventually,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ness said that Mars died much more quickly than Earth because  
the red planet is smaller and had much less internal heat generated 
by friction and the decay of radioactive minerals.

<HEADLINE> Mozart Soprano Stader Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Lyric soprano Maria Stader, one of  
this century's leading performers of Mozart arias, has died, Zurich 
city authorities said Thursday. She was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Stader died in Zurich on Tuesday night, an official said. The  
cause of death was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
	She retired from the stage after a final 1969 performance of  
Mozart's Requiem in New York's Carnegie Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she sang the ``Queen of the Night'' in ``The Magic  
Flute'' at London's Covent Garden opera house in 1949 and 1950, 
Stader rarely appeared in operas. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she concentrated on concerts, for which she was sought  
out by leading conductors on both sides of the Atlantic, including 
Bruno Walter and Herbert von Karajan. 
</P>
<P>
	Stader made her U.S. debut in 1954. She performed with the  
Philadelphia Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic and the Cleveland 
Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1956 in Israel, she sang with the Israel Philharmonic under  
Ferenc Fricsay in 22 concert performances of Donizetti's Lucia di 
Lammermoor and Handel's Judas Maccabaeus. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1911, she was left as an abandoned  
orphan after World War I. She was taken by the international Red 
Cross in 1922 to Switzerland, where was adopted by fisherman Hans 
Stader. She grew up on the shores of Lake Constance, where she 
began her music studies. 
</P>
<P>
	She continued studying with Hans Keller, in Karlsruhe, Germany;  
Arrange Lombardi in Milan; and Theresa Schnabel in New York. She 
rose to prominence when she won an international competition in 
Geneva in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
	Stader spent World War II in Switzerland, but went on to sing  
throughout Europe in the post-war years. She specialized in Bach 
cantatas and masses and particularly in Mozart's concert arias. 
</P>
<P>
	Mozart's ``Exsultate, jubilate'' became her trademark. Among her  
opera roles were Donna Elvira, Pamina and Konstanze. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1950 and 1956, she was awarded the Lilli Lehmann medal for  
outstanding artistic achievement by the Mozarteum in Salzburg, 
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	Stader also taught voice in Zurich, published a text book on  
Bach arias and wrote her memoirs under the German title ``Nehmt 
meinen Dank'' (Take my thanks). 
</P>
<P>
	She married Swiss conductor Hans Erismann in 1959. They had two  
sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of survivors and funeral arrangements were not  
immediately available.

<HEADLINE> 7,000 Attend Last Columbine Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- To a gospel choir's spirited melodies, nearly  
7,000 mourners bade farewell Thursday to the last of Columbine 
High's dead: 4-foot-11 football player Isaiah Shoels, who was two 
things his killers apparently hated, athletic and black. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoels, 18, who was known as ``Little Man'' to friends, was  
buried in his graduation cap and gown. The three-hour funeral 
capped a week of mourning the 13 victims of the April 20 shooting, 
which devastated the Denver suburb of Littleton and shocked the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the last piece. Now the healing begins,'' said the  
Rev. Larry Russell, executive pastor of Heritage Christian Center. 
``I don't think the healing could begin until today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shoels was an outgoing young man with an easy smile. He wanted  
to become a music executive. He was an accomplished athlete who 
could bench press twice his weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the Columbine gunmen, sought out  
athletes to kill, and some witnesses said they also targeted Shoels 
because he was black. That prompted Shoels' father, Michael, to 
note that the young man ``had two strikes against him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Shoels and Isaiah's mother, Vonda, embraced and shivered  
as the lid of his silver casket was closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``When does this stop? When does it end?'' said William Collins,  
Isaiah's grandfather. ``I'm tired of laying to rest politicians, 
engineers, athletes, musicians, artists, janitors and sanitation 
haulers who are robbed of reaching their potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Foss, an 18-year-old Columbine senior who was hurt slightly  
in the attack, was at the service with his twin, Adam. They said 
they used to call Shoels ``Little Man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's smiling down on us,'' Nick Foss said. ``I know he is.''  
</P>
<P>
	Many in the crowd appeared exhausted.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never even come close to seeing this grief in the eyes  
and lives of the families of these teen-agers who were so full of 
life,'' said the Rev. Billy Epperhart, who presided over four of 
the funerals over the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	By the thousands, people have come to service after service,  
packing pews and sharing tears to say goodbye to one, three, even 
five friends -- more funerals in a week than some people attend in 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	They said farewell to the beloved business teacher and to the  
avid Denver Broncos fan, to the actress who was trying to quit 
smoking and to the kid who wanted to fly F-16s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have the privilege of knowing Isaiah. And I didn't  
know the boy that we buried yesterday or the child that we buried 
on Tuesday and Monday or Sunday or Saturday. But I do know that 
these were good children,'' Gov. Bill Owens said. ``If there's 
anything good that can come from this, it's that it's bringing 
Colorado and this nation together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Riddle, the Shoels family spokesman, expressed appreciation  
``to the community and the world for opening up their hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shoels, who wanted to attend an arts college after graduation in  
May, suffered health problems as a child and had heart surgery 
twice. Classmates enjoyed him so much that they competed to work 
with him on group assignments, Columbine principal Frank DeAngelis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Isaiah was in the cafeteria, there was a group of people  
around Isaiah. People wanted to be around Isaiah,'' DeAngelis said. 
``Isaiah Shoels, thank you for having such a positive impact on our 
school and on our family. You will be greatly missed, and I love 
you, my dear child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On April 20, Shoels and other students were in the library when  
gunmen burst into the room. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness said one of the killers turned their attention to  
Shoels, saying ``I hate niggers,'' then firing three times. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral program quoted Shoels' last conversation with his  
mother on the morning of his death. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I look nice today?'' he asked.  
</P>
<P>
	She told him: ``You look as good as gold.''  
</P>
<P>
	Then he left.

	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Membership in the Southern Baptist  
Convention, the nation's largest Protestant faith, slipped 1 
percent in 1998, the first loss in 72 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Records show membership dropped to 15.7 million. Baptisms were  
down by about 4,800, but attendance at Sunday morning services and 
Sunday school were up by 174,052 and 7,832, respectively, and 
offerings and other gifts came to more than $6.9 billion, up 4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Convention observers cite many factors that may be behind the  
drop in membership. Among them: some individuals' decision to drop 
their affiliation with any particular denomination, the growth of 
the megachurch and the advent of alternative churches as the 
convention's leadership became more conservative. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Ammerman, professor of sociology and religion at Hartford  
(Conn.) Seminary, said the most visible change was last year's 
amendment to convention beliefs that women should ``submit 
graciously'' to their husbands. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Hough, dean of the Vanderbilt University Divinity School in  
Nashville, said the drop is very small considering the Southern 
Baptists' membership and ``considering the amount of turmoil in 
their denomination.''

 *Priest leaves $1 million to diocese    	
</P>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Forty years ago, Monsignor James E.  
McSweeney earned $25 a month. But by the time he died at 74 in 
early April, he had amassed nearly $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The James E. McSweeney Endowment Fund will be used by the Roman  
Catholic Diocese of Raleigh to help educate prospective priests and 
to allow ordained priests to earn advance degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	During the day, McSweeney celebrated mass, performed baptisms  
and heard confessions. At night, his friends said, he scrutinized 
the stock market and developed the skills of a shrewd investor. 
</P>
<P>
	``In his later years we knew he had money and that he was  
building up his portfolio,'' said the Rev. Gerald Lewis, vicar 
general of the diocese and co-executor of McSweeney's estate. ``We 
used to tease him about it. But he said, `It's not for me. It's for 
the church.' And it was.''

 *Southern Baptist seminary to expand    	
</P>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Southern Baptist Theological Seminary  
will undergo a $70 million renovation and expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The project on the 80-acre campus will double library space, add  
campus housing and provide a home for the Billy Graham School of 
Missions, Evangelism and Church Growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Among plans for the 80-acre campus are expanded communications  
technology, a learning and performance center with a 1,500-seat 
auditorium, and a building for the Graham school, a 5-year-old, 
accredited graduate program. The theological library, one of the 
world's largest, will be doubled in size to 160,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion plans come on the heels of philosophical rifts  
between campus conservatives and moderates which led to the 
departure of many moderate faculty and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a clear indication that all of that is behind us  
...,'' said R. Albert Mohler Jr., seminary president. 
</P>
<P>
	On-campus enrollment this spring is 1,372, up 8 percent from a  
year ago. Total enrollment is 1,828, and seminary officials predict 
steady growth for the next several years.

	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- A major Protestant house will publish  
a Bible designed for Catholics.

	An agency of the national Catholic bishops' conference granted  
Zondervan Publishing House permission to use the New American Bible

<HEADLINE> Parents: Home Schooling a Shelter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Kim Dunderdale doesn't have to worry about  
her kids running into violence at school -- they're at home, like 
thousands of others across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we first decided to home school our oldest daughter, we  
didn't say we wanted to keep our children out of public school and 
away from all the horrible things that go on there,'' said 
Dunderdale, a Pittsburgh woman who teaches three of her five 
children, the oldest of whom is in eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	``But over the years, we are glad our children are shielded from  
those things,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's shootings at a Littleton, Colo., high school that  
left 15 people dead reminded the more than 700,000 U.S. families 
that teach their children at home why they chose to take their 
children out of school. 
</P>
<P>
	Many abhor what they consider immorality, violence and peer  
pressure in the nation's school systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am trying to shelter them from negative influences, foul  
language, lack of respect for authority, lack of respect for 
themselves or others. It is those kinds of things that led to the 
Littleton thing,'' said Kurt Boese of Lodi, Calif., where he home 
schools his three children. 
</P>
<P>
	Teaching children at home has gradually moved into the  
educational mainstream. Unlike 15 years ago, each state now 
recognizes the parental right to home school and all states have 
legislation or case law governing academic standards. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1.7 million children are taught at home across the  
country, according to the Home School Legal Defense Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The reasons given by parents are varied -- religious guidelines,  
the desire to spend more time with their kids, a better education, 
concern about morals taught at school. It is a burden, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``Home schooling your children because you fear violence and  
fear what will happen to them will not take you through the rough 
times,'' said Cindy McKeown, a mother of four from Middletown. ``It 
is a tremendous sacrifice of time, finances. You have to home 
school because you believe it is the best option for this child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And home schooling cannot prevent tragedy or keep kids from  
growing up, said Ruth Blount, who home schools her six children in 
Nantucket, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always a risk with children. Something horrible could  
happen in our family even if we home school,'' Mrs. Blount said. 
``At a certain point, your kid's going to have to choose on their 
own. But when you home school, you have the time with them to plant 
those seeds more easily.''

<HEADLINE>  Abdul-Jabbar: Lakers Underachievers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar believes the Los Angeles  
Lakers are underachievers who lack chemistry, while citing 
Shaquille O'Neal's lack of leadership and Kobe Bryant's immaturity. 
He also thinks the Lakers made a mistake in signing Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers were picked by many to win their first title in 11  
years before this season, but with the playoffs approaching, 
they've been losing with increasing regularity. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have talented, highly-paid athletes at every position and  
they're not getting it done,'' Abdul-Jabbar, a former Lakers' star, 
said. ``I don't think it's happening as a cohesive unit. (But) I 
haven't seen them practice. I don't know what's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While expressing respect for O'Neal and Bryant, Abdul-Jabbar  
thinks both have their shortcomings. In addition, Abdul-Jabbar 
didn't think the signing of Rodman would work out because it didn't 
appear the seven-time NBA rebounding champion had a sincere 
interest in playing at this stage of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar also feels it's too early to judge the coaching job  
being done by ex-teammate Kurt Rambis, and although he wouldn't say 
it, the leading scorer in NBA history appears to feel snubbed by 
the Lakers in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar, who spent 14 of his 20 seasons with the Lakers and  
helped the team win five championships during the 1980s, wants a 
coaching job, and was interviewed recently by the Washington 
Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not going to make a decision until the season's  
over,'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``Hopefully, I'll make the short list. 
(Wizards executive) Wes Unseld has been a friend. I was thankful he 
was interested enough to explore the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Charlotte coach) Paul Silas has waited 16 years. It's not  
like I'm doing worse than anybody else. You have to be patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar, 52, said interest has been expressed by other NBA  
teams as well as some college teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the Lakers had called, he replied, ``No. The Lakers  
have given plenty of guys who played for them opportunities. That's 
just the way it's worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One guy is Rambis, a teammate of Abdul-Jabbar's for seven years.  
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers haven't won an NBA championship since 1988 --  
Abdul-Jabbar's next-to-last year with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't appear they'll get there this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like they've been trying a number of different  
things,'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``It's impossible to find the people 
with the right chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know people who go to as many games as they can. They talk  
about diminished expectations. It's a jigsaw puzzle. (Lakers 
executive) Jerry West has been right about figuring it out a lot of 
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently not this time, although Abdul-Jabbar said West was in  
a tough position because Lakers owner Jerry Buss makes a lot of the 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was entirely in Jerry's hands,'' Abdul-Jabbar said of  
West, ``things might have been done differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar said his initial reaction to the signing of Rodman,  
who later was waived, was ``he would be an elixir or a poison 
pill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even his antics could not disrupt the secure team atmosphere  
that Michael Jordan engendered just being (with the Chicago 
Bulls),'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``The Lakers did not have that kind of 
stability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever happens as far as me coaching, I'll never be involved  
(with a player like Rodman). How a key element can come to practice 
without shoes and socks and late -- `I'm here' -- well, that's going 
to hurt a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar said O'Neal does a lot of good things on the court,  
but ``he's not been able to lead his team all the way either 
emotionally or statistically. He comes up short. However, no one 
can do it by themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's talented, he works hard, but there are certain things he  
hasn't learned,'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``I am not on a crusade 
against Shaq, I don't mean to belittle him. (But) it hasn't 
happened yet. Guys who can move around the pivot and can score from 
8-or-10 feet give Shaq a lot of trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar called the 20-year-old Bryant ``a great young  
talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Abdul-Jabbar added, ``He has to mature. He makes bad  
choices a lot in the games that hurt the team. That is an element 
of not playing college ball. There are times when he tries to do 
too much, whether it be going against the double-team or taking the 
38-foot 3-pointer with 20 seconds left on the clock. He's got 
talent, he just needs to make better decisions.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> VW Workers Protest Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, Germany (AP) -- More than 10,000 employees at a  
Volkswagen plant walked off their jobs to protest the automaker's 
plans to lay off 550 workers on short-term contracts, union 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assembly lines at the plant in Emden, northern Germany, have  
been idle since noon Wednesday and will remain shut on Friday, said 
Regina Allemann, plant representative for the powerful IG Metall 
union. 
</P>
<P>
	IG Metall officials said they were incensed that VW refused to  
renew the short-term contracts while asking regular employees at 
Emden to work overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials were to discuss Friday whether to extend the  
walkouts to VW's five other German plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Volkswagen this week reported a 2.9-percent rise in  
first-quarter net earnings, well below analysts' expectations.

<HEADLINE>  Abdul-Jabbar: Lakers Underachievers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar believes the Los Angeles  
Lakers are underachievers who lack chemistry, while citing 
Shaquille O'Neal's lack of leadership and Kobe Bryant's immaturity. 
He also thinks the Lakers made a mistake in signing Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers were picked by many to win their first title in 11  
years before this season, but with the playoffs approaching, 
they've been losing with increasing regularity. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have talented, highly-paid athletes at every position and  
they're not getting it done,'' Abdul-Jabbar, a former Lakers' star, 
said. ``I don't think it's happening as a cohesive unit. (But) I 
haven't seen them practice. I don't know what's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While expressing respect for O'Neal and Bryant, Abdul-Jabbar  
thinks both have their shortcomings. In addition, Abdul-Jabbar 
didn't think the signing of Rodman would work out because it didn't 
appear the seven-time NBA rebounding champion had a sincere 
interest in playing at this stage of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar also feels it's too early to judge the coaching job  
being done by ex-teammate Kurt Rambis, and although he wouldn't say 
it, the leading scorer in NBA history appears to feel snubbed by 
the Lakers in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar, who spent 14 of his 20 seasons with the Lakers and  
helped the team win five championships during the 1980s, wants a 
coaching job, and was interviewed recently by the Washington 
Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not going to make a decision until the season's  
over,'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``Hopefully, I'll make the short list. 
(Wizards executive) Wes Unseld has been a friend. I was thankful he 
was interested enough to explore the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Charlotte coach) Paul Silas has waited 16 years. It's not  
like I'm doing worse than anybody else. You have to be patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar, 52, said interest has been expressed by other NBA  
teams as well as some college teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the Lakers had called, he replied, ``No. The Lakers  
have given plenty of guys who played for them opportunities. That's 
just the way it's worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One guy is Rambis, a teammate of Abdul-Jabbar's for seven years.  
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers haven't won an NBA championship since 1988 --  
Abdul-Jabbar's next-to-last year with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't appear they'll get there this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like they've been trying a number of different  
things,'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``It's impossible to find the people 
with the right chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know people who go to as many games as they can. They talk  
about diminished expectations. It's a jigsaw puzzle. (Lakers 
executive) Jerry West has been right about figuring it out a lot of 
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently not this time, although Abdul-Jabbar said West was in  
a tough position because Lakers owner Jerry Buss makes a lot of the 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was entirely in Jerry's hands,'' Abdul-Jabbar said of  
West, ``things might have been done differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar said his initial reaction to the signing of Rodman,  
who later was waived, was ``he would be an elixir or a poison 
pill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even his antics could not disrupt the secure team atmosphere  
that Michael Jordan engendered just being (with the Chicago 
Bulls),'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``The Lakers did not have that kind of 
stability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever happens as far as me coaching, I'll never be involved  
(with a player like Rodman). How a key element can come to practice 
without shoes and socks and late -- `I'm here' -- well, that's going 
to hurt a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar said O'Neal does a lot of good things on the court,  
but ``he's not been able to lead his team all the way either 
emotionally or statistically. He comes up short. However, no one 
can do it by themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's talented, he works hard, but there are certain things he  
hasn't learned,'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``I am not on a crusade 
against Shaq, I don't mean to belittle him. (But) it hasn't 
happened yet. Guys who can move around the pivot and can score from 
8-or-10 feet give Shaq a lot of trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar called the 20-year-old Bryant ``a great young  
talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Abdul-Jabbar added, ``He has to mature. He makes bad  
choices a lot in the games that hurt the team. That is an element 
of not playing college ball. There are times when he tries to do 
too much, whether it be going against the double-team or taking the 
38-foot 3-pointer with 20 seconds left on the clock. He's got 
talent, he just needs to make better decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the blockbuster trade in March that sent Eddie Jones and  
Elden Campbell to the Charlotte Hornets for Glen Rice and J.R. 
Reid, Abdul-Jabbar said, ``It doesn't seem like it's worked to the 
benefit of the Lakers, it hasn't improved their play. Jones was an 
excellent defensive player ...''

	Clinton Firm on NATO Resolve  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House promised today to press on  
with the military campaign against Yugoslavia despite House votes 
repudiating President Clinton's policies. In two votes yesterday, 
the House withheld support from the 5-week-old NATO air campaign in 
Yugoslavia and demanded congressional approval for any ground 
offensive. The House's rejection, on a 213-213 tie vote of a 
measure to support the air campaign, surprised leaders of both 
parties. The White House said today that Clinton did not see the 
vote as a blow to support on Capitol Hill.

across Serbia and its junior partner Montenegro today on the 37th 
day of its air campaign, but accidentally struck a home in 
Bulgaria's capital when a HARM missile went awry. Meanwhile, the 
Rev. Jesse Jackson arrived in the Balkans today on a mission to win 
freedom for three captured U.S. soldiers, hoping ``our humanitarian 
plea'' for their release will provide ``a way of dignity'' leading 
to a peaceful resolution of the conflict with Yugoslavia.

<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Authorities interviewed a man who may  
have sold the semi-automatic handgun to the youths who went on a 
rampage at Columbine High School, officials said today. District 
Attorney David Thomas told NBC's ``Today'' show that authorities 
were discussing the man's surrender with his attorney. Thomas' 
spokeswoman said more information gathered by police had changed 
the timeline on an arrest. Thomas said the man would be charged 
with violating a law against selling handguns to minors.

	Lawyers Generous to Gore, Bush

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a group, lawyers have been the most  
generous contributors to the presidential campaigns of both Vice 
President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Lawyers accounted 
for $1.4 million of the $8.9 million Gore raised through March 31, 
and $747,550 of the $7.6 million Bush took in during the same 
period, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a 
nonpartisan research group. The numbers might be even higher; 
hundreds of contributors to both candidates failed to list their 
occupations or employers.

	Lawmakers Give Farewell Bonuses  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- All but five of the 42 House members who left  
office early this year gave their staffers goodbye bonuses, The 
Associated Press found. The total reached nearly $1.5 million. 
Former Rep. Bill Hefner, D-N.C., led the group by giving his 13 
staffers $119,100 in bonuses. Most of his aides left with about 
$10,000 each in extra pay in his last three months in office. The 
practice is legal but sharply criticized by taxpayer advocates and 
other watchdog groups. They say lawmakers should try to return 
leftover office allocations to the Treasury rather than use them to 
boost salaries for aides.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States is making progress in  
combating software piracy around the world but the problem remains 
unacceptably widespread, a Clinton administration official said 
today. The official, Stuart Eizenstat, cited the Middle East states 
and even developed countries such as Spain for violating 
international treaties on intellectual property rights. Eizenstat 
warned that the United States would seek action by the World Trade 
Organization against countries that did not comply with those 
agreements.

his concert last night and abruptly walked off the stage when he 
realized someone had stuck a large yellow smiley face on a stage 
prop. The resulting rowdiness ended in 23 arrests. The crowd of 
4,765 appeared stunned when Manson -- already the target of 
criticism this week asserting that his wild, ``gothic'' style 
influenced the Littleton, Colo., school shooting -- became angry and 
stormed off the stage early. Some in the crowd became rowdy and 
swarmed Manson's tour bus.

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G Expands Investment in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- U.S.-based consumer products giant  
Procter &AMP; Gamble has invested $152 million to enlarge its Thailand 
manufacturing plant and turn it into the company's regional export 
base, company officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a major business coup for Thailand, which has been  
suffering its worst economic crisis in modern times. Hundreds of 
factories have closed during the past two years, and nearly 2 
million workers have been left unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our confidence in the future of Thailand remains unchanged  
despite the economic crisis,'' said John E. Pepper, Procter &AMP; 
Gamble's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble is apparently not alone, as Thailand's Board of  
Investment announced this week that the value of both local and 
foreign investment in new manufacturing plants rose 17 percent in 
the first quarter of 1999 compared with the year-earlier quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble said the expansion will allow the company to  
double its exports from Thailand within three years and triple them 
by 2007. 
</P>
<P>
	After expansion, the site in Thailand will be among the  
company's three largest manufacturing plants and will provide 2,000 
new jobs, said Ravi Chaturvedi, the company's managing director in 
Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted the expansion also would generate an additional  
$200 million in revenue for support industries, such as chemicals 
manufacturing and packaging. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant is located in the Wellgrow Industrial Estate on the  
outskirts of Bangkok. The company already had invested $100 million 
in its Thai operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also plans to develop its Bangkok office to be its  
management center for Southern Asia, which covers countries from 
India to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble is among America's 20 largest companies. It  
manufactures and markets a wide range of consumer products 
including detergents, household cleaners, health and beauty aids, 
and food and beverages. 
</P>
<P>
	Its sales in 140 countries during 1998 totaled $37.1 billion.

<HEADLINE> IMF To Resume Lending to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund and Russia  
have reached a tentative agreement that will provide Russia with a 
badly needed infusion of $4.5 billion in new loans, but only after 
Russia implements a series of economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus announced late Wednesday  
that he had reached basic agreement with a high-level Russian 
delegation on the steps Russia will have to take for the loan 
program to resume. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF cut off lending to Russia in August after a meltdown of  
the Russian ruble forced the country to default on billions of 
dollars in foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russian officials launched a major campaign to win  
resumption of loans, sending a high-level delegation to Washington 
this week to discuss the issue with the IMF and finance ministers 
of the world's seven largest industrial countries, who were here 
for the springs meetings of the IMF and World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF loans, once they receive final approval from the  
agency's executive board, will essentially allow Russia to meet 
debt obligations coming due this year to the IMF. Russian 
authorities were anxious to reach such a deal to preserve a 
dwindling supply of foreign currency reserves and help fend off 
other global creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said a ``few technical elements'' remained to be  
settled in coming days. He laid out a series of steps the Russian 
government will have to take before he will actually present the 
loan request to the IMF board. 
</P>
<P>
	Those steps include completion of an outside audit of the  
Russian Central Bank to resolve questions about what happened to 
earlier IMF loans. In addition, the Russian parliament must enact a 
series of economic reforms, including an overhaul of the nation's 
banking system, Camdessus said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as the measures have been implemented and I have  
received the necessary assurances, I shall ask the executive board 
to consider Russia's request,'' Camdessus said in his statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Russian Central Bank President Viktor  
Geraschenko had said he hoped the Russian parliament would be able 
to implement the required reforms by mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse of the Russian economy in August represented an  
embarrassing setback for the IMF because it came only a few weeks 
after the agency had announced a new $22.6 billion rescue program, 
approved at the urging of the Clinton administration, that was 
designed to keep Russia from falling victim to the same currency 
crisis that had struck a number of nations in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian default triggered the darkest period in the nearly  
two-year financial crisis, causing financial markets around the 
world to plummet as fears increased of an impending global 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	However, three rapid-fire reductions in interest rates by the  
Federal Reserve beginning in late September helped to restore 
investor confidence. The U.S. stock market has soared to new record 
levels, and with the rebound in recent months of financial markets 
in many crisis countries, many economists believe the danger is 
receding that the currency panic will spread to other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians discussed the loan request during talks Monday with  
finance ministers of the world's seven wealthiest countries, 
including the United States. At that time, Russian Finance Minister 
Mikhail Zadornov denied that the resumption of IMF lending was 
being linked in any way by the G-7 countries to Russian support in 
helping to resolve the crisis in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian economy has been in a severe recession since last  
year's default on foreign debt and a botched devaluation of the 
Russian ruble. It contracted by 4.8 percent in 1998 and the IMF is 
predicting an even steeper decline of 7 percent in output this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian debt deal came on the closing day of the spring  
meetings of the 182-nation IMF and its sister lending organization, 
the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance ministers who sit on the steering committees of both  
organizations were unable to come to agreement on a package of 
reforms put forward by the Clinton administration to better prepare 
the global financial system to weather future Asian-style currency 
crises. 
</P>
<P>
	However, they did adopt some modest steps and pledged to  
continue working on the bigger issues, which include such things as 
making sure private investors bear part of the cost of future 
bailouts and reforming borrowing practices of developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Jets Player's Wife Foils Carjack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, Ga. (AP) -- A quick-thinking mom foiled a  
carjacking by secretly calling 911 on her cell phone and sneaking 
clues to the dispatcher about what was going on while pretending to 
talk to the driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Esther Green and her 10-month-old daughter were in the back seat  
of their car outside a store in this Atlanta suburb, waiting for a 
friend, when a man climbed into the front seat and drove off Monday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	After he picked up another man, Ms. Green, the wife of New York  
Jets defensive back Victor Green, reached into her diaper bag and 
dialed 911 on her cellular phone, keeping it hidden in the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	To let the dispatcher know she had been kidnapped, she told the  
driver: ``Please stop the car. Please. It's not worth all this. You 
can have the car. You can have the car. Please let me get my baby 
out of the car,'' 
</P>
<P>
	And to describe their location for the dispatcher, she asked him  
to let her out at landmarks along the way, mentioned a route number 
and gave hints on what direction the car was going. ``You're making 
a left?,'' she said. ``Why are you making a left? Why are you 
turning?'' 
</P>
<P>
	She had no idea if anyone was listening at the other end, but  
dispatcher Holly Eason was. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first I assumed it was going to be a domestic situation,''  
Ms. Eason said today when she and Ms. Green met for the first time 
on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' But when the friend Ms. Green 
was waiting for also called to report the car's disappearance, ``we 
put two and two together and realized we had a 
carjacking-kidnapping situation going on,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Eason said her directions were very helpful. ``She was doing  
really well as far as advising that she was heading northbound and 
landmarks that she was passing,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Green said she was prepared to jump out of the car with the  
baby -- not knowing whether anyone was listening on the other end of 
her phone -- when she finally saw a cop car drive by. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that I realized that help was on the way and I could sit  
tight with the baby and just pray that it came out the way that it 
did,'' she said. ``It could not have happened better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She feigned surprise when the police pulled them over: ``Oh, my  
God, they want you stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Eric Bonnett, 18, of Little Hocking, Ohio, and David E.  
McDonald, 21, of Belpre, Ohio, were charged with kidnapping and 
auto theft. They were held in the Fayette County Jail without bond. 
Police said Bonnett was the driver and McDonald was the man who 
climbed in later.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Forward Corie Blount will have knee surgery  
next week and will miss the Cleveland Cavaliers' remaining games of 
the season. He was the third Cavs player whose season was ended 
early by an injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Blount had his left knee examined Thursday at the Cleveland  
Clinic by Dr. John Bergfeld, who discovered a torn medial meniscus. 
</P>
<P>
	Blount joined center Zydrunas Ilgauskas (broken foot) and guard  
Brevin Knight (broken hand) as players the Cavs have lost to 
season-ending injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Kemp, Cleveland's leading scorer and rebounder, has also  
missed two games with a sprained foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Blount, signed by the Cavs in March after being released by the  
Los Angeles Lakers, averaged 3.4 points and 5.3 rebounds in 20

<HEADLINE>  Stocks End Mixed; Dow Rises 32.93 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices ended mixed on Thursday, as  
investors again sold technology stocks but bought financial issues 
in response to a drop in bond market interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average reached its third straight  
record high close, adding 32.93 to end at 10,878.38. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite, hit hard in recent sessions on aggressive  
selling of technology issues, fell 21.93 to 2,528.44, and the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 8.08 at 1,342.83. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more of the same shift that has been evident all week and  
last week,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential 
Securities. ``Again, the Dow is doing well, the Nasdaq is slowing, 
financial and cyclical stocks are in the lead, technology and 
pharmaceutical stocks are in the dumpster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Market leadership has expanded beyond cyclical issues, those  
that respond closely to changes in economic outlook. Financial 
stocks climbed aggressively Thursday as fresh data showing benign 
inflation pushed interest rates lower in the bond market. American 
Express was up 2 5/16 at 135 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury bond yield fell to 5.52 percent from late  
Wednesday's 5.54 percent after the Labor Department reported wages 
and benefits for American workers rose a moderate 0.4 percent in 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase was half of what analysts had expected, and it  
suggested the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates to 
curb inflation anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	But while wages are under control, the economy is still growing  
and unemployment remains very low. A separate Labor Department 
report showed that new claims for state unemployment benefits 
declined last week.

	Cyclical stocks have been on the upswing for several weeks as  
investors celebrate the fact that the domestic economy is still 
humming and hope that foreign economies are on the mend. Minnesota 
Mining and Manufacturing was up 1 1/8 at 85 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset  
Management, said that if indeed there is no inflation in the 
economy, the current advance in the shares of cyclical companies 
will be short-lived. Investors will soon gravitate back to growth 
stocks, shares of companies that may not have yet produced strong 
earnings but are expected to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cyclical companies require a very robust economy with  
inflationary pressures in order to generate their earnings,'' 
Orlando said, ``whereas growth companies can make money regardless 
of the performance of the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald,  
disagreed. ``People are not buying the cyclicals because things are 
extraordinarily great now; they're buying them because the world 
economy is seen as improving in the future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, investors continued to take profits in technology and  
pharmaceutical shares that had soared until recent sessions. 
Amazon.com slid 25 1/4 to 168 1/4. The online retailer reported late 
Wednesday a first-quarter loss of 23 cents, narrower than the 29 
cents analysts expected. However, the company expects its growth to 
slow and losses to increase as it continues to invest heavily in 
new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugmaker Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn dropped 1 13/16 to 55 1/2, even after  
the company met analysts' expectations with a 17 percent increase 
in first-quarter earnings.

<P>
	Advancing issues were only slightly ahead of decliners, and  
volume was moderately heavy at 962.45 million shares, up slightly 
from Wednesday's pace.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan, China Both Seek To Join WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- At odds with China on most fronts, Taiwan  
has found a common quest with its rival: the desire for membership 
in the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Taiwan has maintained it is as important as China  
when it comes to world trade, so its application for membership in 
the international trade group should be treated separately. 
</P>
<P>
	But as China has drawn closer to entry, Taiwan has decided to  
pin its hopes of joining the WTO on China's coattails. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan has completed all trade negotiations required by WTO  
members, and is continuing its own lobbying efforts. Taiwanese 
Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang departs for Washington on Monday 
to seek U.S. support of Taiwan's entry this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nation believes its admission is stalled because WTO  
members don't want to risk the ire of China, which claims 
sovereignty over Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing insists that it must get into the WTO first, then Taiwan  
can follow as long as the island is admitted as a ``tariff zone'' 
and not as a nation. ``We hope relevant parties will observe 
this,'' said Sun Yuxi, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Separated politically since a civil war in 1949, Taiwan and  
China do not recognize each other, and Taiwan has refused official 
contacts with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	As a global outcast, Taiwan hopes WTO membership could give it  
more international exposure. Taiwan is denied preferential tariff 
treatments by most countries and access to international 
arbitration of trade disputes -- benefits it hopes to gain through 
WTO membership. 
</P>
<P>
	China has stepped up its drive for WTO membership and offered  
substantial concessions to lower trade barriers in areas ranging 
from telecommunications to insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Continued worries over China's concessions in financial  
services, steel and textile businesses prompted President Clinton 
to lobby against China's membership earlier this month. Still, WTO 
secretary-general Renato Ruggiero says China might qualify for 
membership as early as November. 
</P>
<P>
	That came as a great relief to Taiwan's WTO negotiators.  
Membership is so appealing to Taiwan that officials are casting 
aside concerns that a WTO spot could draw Beijing closer to 
Washington and thus imperil Taiwan's political interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan even indicated it could negotiate with China to remove  
trade barriers against Chinese goods once both are admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	After Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji agreed to concessions when  
visiting Washington early this month, Taiwanese President Lee 
Teng-hui said the two sides could talk about trade and agriculture 
cooperation once both are in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an open mind, and we are willing to talk about many  
issues,'' Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	With both in the WTO, Taiwan is bound to face escalating  
pressure to ease trade barriers against Chinese farm goods, allow 
Chinese firms to invest in Taiwan and end its ban on air and 
shipping links. Meanwhile, Taiwanese economists expect China to 
open its markets further in exchange for foreign capital and 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	One persistent fear is that China will balk if Western countries  
demand more severe trade concessions, thereby dampen Taiwan's hopes 
of joining. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, amid U.S. complaints about a growing trade deficit, Taiwan  
fears further delays would give Washington a chance to reopen trade 
negotiations with stricter demands. Taiwan has already made 
concessions on U.S. pork imports and car imports from other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have already suffered trade losses but have yet to enjoy  
any benefits,'' said Kuo Weng-cheng, an economist at the Chunghwa 
Institute of Economic Research. ``Public support for WTO accession 
would drop if we can't be admitted this year.''

<HEADLINE> Casino, Lottery Moratorium Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of legalized gambling hope to  
strike the word ``moratorium'' from the recommendations of a 
federal commission studying America's infatuation with slot 
machines and lottery tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	After 22 months of uneasy cooperation, members of the National  
Gambling Impact Study Commission battled over the word during a 
two-day meeting that ended Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 5-4 vote, and over impassioned dissent, the commission  
approved a section for its report that includes the sentence: 
``Some policy-makers at all levels may want to impose an explicit 
moratorium on gambling expansion while awaiting further research 
and assessment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this language is very important,'' said Bernard Horn,  
spokesman for the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling. 
``The real influence of this commission will be felt in state 
legislatures, and this recommendation will have a profound effect 
on the way state policy-makers look at gambling expansion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission cannot impose a moratorium, but its report will  
call for ``a pause'' in the growth of legalized gambling and 
encourage state and local governments to form their own gambling 
study commissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., the casino industry's chief lobbyist in  
Washington, predicted the commission will reconsider the use of 
``moratorium'' at its final meetings in May or June. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission Chairwoman Kay James did not rule out that  
possibility. ``We are in the draft phase,'' she said. ``Anything 
can change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission faces a June 18 deadline to submit its report to  
Congress, the White House, governors and native American leaders. 
In addition to a previously scheduled two-day meeting next month, 
the commission decided to meet for two days in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners supporting the call for a moratorium described it  
as a national deep breath -- a moment to consider gambling's 
proliferation before more casinos are built and lottery games 
introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're saying is: There's not enough information, we need  
more research, we need more data, and whatever direction you're 
going to go, a pause is a prudent course at this point in time,'' 
James said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the debate over ``moratorium'' split the commission. At  
least one pro-gambling commission member, MGM Grand Inc. Chairman 
J. Terrence Lanni, plans to write a minority report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a problem with the notion that we're going to stop the  
world or pause or create a moratorium'' just to wait for more 
research, said Commissioner Robert Loescher, an Alaska businessman 
and native American. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner John Wilhelm, who represents casino workers as  
general president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees 
Union, said commissioners who support gambling endorse efforts to 
address its social costs, but the panel's gambling opponents 
``don't give a damn'' about jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the language encouraging a moratorium, Wilhelm  
proposed an additional sentence encouraging an expansion of 
gambling in ``economically depressed communities for which the 
economic benefits of gaming are most clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission defeated that language, leaving Wilhelm to warn  
that the report is becoming ``one-sided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our record is that in many kinds of communities in this  
country, including in particularly economically depressed 
communities -- urban and rural, as well as Indian reservations -- 
that there is a net positive economic impact'' from casinos, 
Wilhelm said. ``But you can't find that in any of these drafts.''

<HEADLINE> Colts Rookie Is Killed in Car Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts hardly had time to  
get to know Brandon Burlsworth. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you knew you wanted to get to know him. That speaks  
volumes for him as a person and his family and everyone involved in 
his life,'' Colts center Jay Leeuwenburg said Thursday. ``You don't 
say that about everyone, particularly after knowing them only for a 
few days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burlsworth, a third-round draft pick from Arkansas, was killed  
in a car crash less than a half-hour from his home on Wednesday. 
The rookie lineman had just returned from the Colts' weekend 
mini-camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``The common feeling among the players is shock and regret we  
didn't have the opportunity to know him,'' Leeuwenburg said. ``It 
brings up the mortality in us all. Particularly in this business, 
you go around with the feeling that you're invincible. You see 
someone like Brandon who had everything going for him and it's very 
difficult to come to grips with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3 1/4, 308-pound offensive guard started his football  
career at Arkansas as a walk-on, eventually earned a scholarship 
and finished as an All-Southeastern Conference pick and on The 
Associated Press All-America second team. He was the only Arkansas 
footbll player to earn a master's degree before playing his last 
game, which was the Jan. 1 Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, he attended the NFL scouting combine in  
Indianapolis and was impressive with a 40-yard dash in 4.88 seconds 
and a 31.5-inch vertical leap. The Colts made him the 63rd player 
taken overall in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the scouting process, you get to know the young men you  
scout, probably better than they know themselves in some 
instances,'' Colts president Bill Polian said. ``From everything we 
could glean, Brandon represented pretty much everything we want in 
a Colt football player. We were thrilled to draft him and very 
happy to have him here. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made a great impression on those that he came in contact  
with the short time he was here,'' Polian said. 
</P>
<P>
	A state police report said Burlsworth's car went left of the  
center line on U.S. 412 and hit the left front fender of a 
tractor-trailer. After returning to its lane briefly, the car 
crossed the center line again and hit a second truck.

<HEADLINE> Schieffer Resigns From Rangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- After 11 years of helping transform the  
Texas Rangers into a winning team playing in a top-notch stadium, 
Tom Schieffer resigned as club president Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Schieffer, a key player in the building of The Ballpark in  
Arlington, will become the point man overseeing the development of 
the 270 acres around the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always said we have this piece of land ... that's the  
bull's eye for an unbelievable development. If I can have some role 
in making that happen, that's something I can be very proud of,'' 
said Schieffer, who also will consult for the team on other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Schieffer, however, also left open the possibility of joining  
the likely presidential campaign of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a 
close friend and his predecessor running the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Schieffer, who discussed his resignation with Bush on Wednesday,  
wouldn't say the potential White House run was a reason for 
stepping down, but he did call it an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see the governor become president,'' said  
Schieffer, a former three-term member of the Texas House of 
Representatives. ``Whatever he would like me to do, I'd like to 
help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team owner Tom Hicks is using Schieffer's departure to merge the  
business side of his two professional sports teams, the Rangers and 
the NHL's Dallas Stars. It's an idea similar to the joint operation 
that would be created by the proposed merger of baseball's New York 
Yankees and basketball's New Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sports are changing,'' said Hicks, who is trying to create a  
regional sports network. ``We have a chance to really build 
something that gives us the resources to be as competitive as we 
can possibly be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schieffer, 51, was part of a group headed by Bush and Rusty Rose  
who bought the team in 1989. The following year he was put in 
charge of the project to build a new stadium and in 1991 he became 
team president. He became managing general partner in 1994 after 
Bush was elected governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Schieffer's other duties with the club include trying to improve  
spring training facilities in Port Charlotte, Fla., or possibly 
moving to a new site, and enhancing the team's player development 
facilities in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig called Schieffer ``an important and  
valued member of the baseball establishment,'' noting that he 
served on the realignment committee and the commissioner's blue 
ribbon economic task force. 
</P>
<P>
	``While he was a strong and powerful advocate of Texas Rangers'  
causes, he understood the totality of issues that surrounded the 
game and invariably acted in its best interests,'' Selig said. ``I 
will miss his counsel and his passion.''

<HEADLINE> Sanctions Possible in Spy Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A number of Energy Department and national  
weapons laboratory officials face possible disciplinary action 
because a scientist was provided continued access to top nuclear 
secrets long after he became a target of an espionage 
investigation, government officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	An internal Energy Department investigation of the scientist and  
possible theft of secrets by China at the Los Alamos National 
Laboratory in New Mexico is focusing on ``why was this man 
permitted access for so long,'' a senior official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwan-born scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was fired on March 8 for  
security violations. He had been the prime target of an FBI 
investigation into the theft of weapons secrets for nearly three 
years at the weapons research lab. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson confirmed that Lee, a computer  
scientist, had transferred a large number of top-secret weapons 
computer codes from a highly secure system to his unclassified 
computer, potentially making them vulnerable to outside access. 
</P>
<P>
	A government official, meanwhile, said the FBI was upset by  
disclosure this week that investigators knew of the computer 
transfers because they were planning to re-interview Lee and didn't 
want him to know they had discovered what he had done with the 
files. 
</P>
<P>
	The thefts allegedly occurred in the 1980s. Lee, who worked at  
the lab since 1978, has not been charged with a crime and has 
denied being involved in any espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	Only late last year was Lee shifted to where he would not have  
access to the most secure nuclear weapons material, including 
extensive computer codes on weapons design and performance, 
according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, it was learned Wednesday that investigators for  
nearly two years were prevented from examining Lee's personal 
computer at Los Alamos because Los Alamos employees never had been 
put on formal notice that their computers were subject to search. 
</P>
<P>
	A search of Lee's computer was proposed as early as 1996, but  
both FBI and Justice Department lawyers said a warrant would be 
needed because the lab's computers did not contain warnings they 
were subject to search as government property, the officials said, 
and there was not enough hard evidence to get a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
	When investigators finally examined Lee's computer after the  
scientist had been fired, they found the computer contained 
extensive files of top-secret weapons design and performance codes, 
although the computer was part of an unclassified system with wide 
access and could be used to send data in and out of the lab 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of top-secret data in Lee's less secure computer  
is expected to raise new questions about why he was allowed to keep 
his security clearance and allowed continued access to some of the 
lab's most sensitive weapons data more than two years after he 
became a leading suspect in the alleged theft by China of 
information on a sophisticated nuclear warheads, the W-88, in the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Energy Department officials have concluded that some  
disciplinary action is warranted against a number of both 
department and Los Alamos laboratory officials for failing to take 
action against Lee sooner, said one official. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were communication gaffs, failures to notify officials  
within Los Alamos and between Los Alamos and the department about 
Lee's status and why he wasn't removed from sensitive areas,'' said 
one official familiar with an internal investigation now under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Alamos has about 20,000 computers and only about 3,000 of  
them are in a classified system whose access is limited to 
employees with top-secret clearance, according to lab officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the files in Lee's computer had been transferred from  
Los Alamos' highly secure computer system in 1994-95, although 
evidence was found the Lee made some authorized transfers as early 
as 1983, an official said. He said there was no evidence that the 
files were accessed from outside the laboratory, but also no 
assurance that they were not. 
</P>
<P>
	``Classified nuclear weapons codes at Los Alamos were  
transferred to an unclassified computer system,'' Richardson 
acknowledged in a statement late Wednesday, although not commenting 
on specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said in an interview that new security measures --  
both a physical firewall and extensive monitoring of computer 
systems -- ``will prevent these kinds of transfers'' in the future. 
``I believe we are cyber security safe,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The top-secret data found in Lee's computer with new file  
numbers included computer codes used in weapons design and analysis 
of nuclear tests. The codes are especially important in the 
government's assessment of weapons performance without actual 
nuclear testing, but could also be helpful to someone trying to 
copy U.S. warhead design, nuclear weapons experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, administration officials including Richardson had  
said no attempt was made to lift Lee's security clearance and move 
him to a less sensitive job because of concern that such a move it 
might tip him that he was the target of an investigation.

<HEADLINE> Japan Jobless Rate Hits Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's jobless rate shot up to yet another record  
high of 4.8 percent last month, as corporate restructuring efforts 
forced more people out of work, the government said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest figure sets a new record after the jobless rate hit  
an all-time high of 4.6 percent in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unemployment situation is becoming increasingly severe.  
And it is our most important task to tackle the situation,'' Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Those out of work reached a record 3.39 million in March, while  
those employed fell by 840,000 from a year earlier to 63.84 million 
-- the 14th straight month of declines. 
</P>
<P>
	Income for wage earners in the fiscal year ended March 31 fell  
1.3 percent from the previous year -- the biggest drop since the 
government started keeping records in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Jobs remain scarce and the situation is unlikely to improve  
soon, government officials say. The jobless data are likely to 
heighten pessimism about the nation's economy, which could further 
hurt chances for a turnaround as worried consumers curtail 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Lackluster consumer spending is a major reason the Japanese  
economy has not been able to rescue itself. 
</P>
<P>
	The government found that spending fell 0.9 percent on the year  
in the fiscal year ended March 31, after dropping 2.3 percent the 
previous 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, the government said that there were only 88 jobs  
per 100 job seekers. That was down from a year ago of 96 jobs per 
100 job seekers

<HEADLINE> Johnson Misses News Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- Reggie Johnson, a no-show Thursday for a  
news conference, won't be able to hide in a fight to unify the 
light heavyweight title, opponent Roy Jones Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reggie is trying to play a chess match and get into my head.  
Reggie can't beat me. I will do a number on him when we fight,'' 
Jones, the WBC and WBA light heavyweight champion, said during a 
news conference to promote the June 5 bout at the Mississippi Coast 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reggie's no-show didn't bother me. He's trying to get ready  
and try to cash in on a big payday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IBF champion Johnson, a left-hander who has a 39-5-1 record with  
24 KOs, said during a similar gathering two weeks ago in New York 
that it was the biggest fight in the career of both boxers. 
</P>
<P>
	But he didn't appear in Biloxi to publicize the bout because of  
a schedule conflict with his training in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``By coming to the press conference, Reggie felt that he would  
only be helping Roy Jones sell tickets,'' said Murad Muhammad, 
Jones' promoter. ``But all of that comes with the territory of 
promoting a big fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones and Johnson also have a personal history, one which Jones  
says damaged his relationship with his father. 
</P>
<P>
	Both fighters trained in Pensacola, Fla., early during their  
professional careers under the tutelage of Roy Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones Jr. said he grew uncomfortable with Johnson in his camp  
because he knew they would have to fight someday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think it was good that we were working together,''  
Jones said Thursday. ``My father still wanted to train him. It made 
no sense for us to be trained by the same guy. That's one of the 
main reasons why my father and I parted ways in 1992.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 30, a former IBF middleweight and super middleweight  
champion, won the WBC light heavyweight title in 1996, lost on a 
disqualification to Montell Griffin in 1997 and regained the title 
with a first-round knockout of Griffin later that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones added the WBA title by outpointing Lou Del Valle last July  
18. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 32, won the WBA light heavyweight title in 1992 and  
lost it in 1993. After failing twice to regain it, he became IBF 
champion by knocking out William Guthrie in the fifth round in 
February 1998.

<HEADLINE> IRS Disputes Whistleblower's Rating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Internal Revenue Service whistleblower who  
claims agency retaliation because of her congressional testimony 
about taxpayer abuses got positive job ratings for years. Now, the 
IRS contends in court documents she has actually done inferior work 
since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is business as usual at the IRS,'' said revenue agent  
Jennifer Long in a telephone interview Thursday from Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Long has responded with two sworn statements from current and  
former IRS employees who say they have also suffered retaliation 
because of their testimony before the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The court filings are part of a federal race and age  
discrimination lawsuit Long brought against the Treasury Department 
in 1997, shortly after her Finance Committee testimony. The IRS 
motion to dismiss the case was filed just as the agency was moving 
to fire Long, a decision she called retaliation for her testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The April 15 attempt to dismiss Long -- since rescinded by top  
IRS officials -- was based on a 13-page summary of poor performance 
since 1997, when she first received unsatisfactory notices after 
nothing but stellar annual reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the IRS says in the court documents that Long's supervisors  
had questions about her work for years in spite of those positive 
annual ratings: ``Since 1991, all of (Long's) managers have found 
her work consistently lacking in more than one critical element.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two managers say they gave her positive annual reviews because  
they'd been her superiors for only a few months and didn't feel 
comfortable changing her rating to a negative. One IRS manager, 
identified as Barbara Craney, said she was preoccupied with her own 
medical problems and was afraid to single Long out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although I gave Mrs. Long this fully successful rating, I did  
not think she deserved it,'' Craney says in court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	In her response filed Tuesday, Long calls the IRS allegations  
``part of a pattern of undue oppression and harassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long's performance, the response says, was ``evaluated as  
satisfactory until the very day that her supervisor became aware 
she was flying to Washington to testify before the Senate Finance 
Committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, IRS employee Michael Ayala and a former employee,  
Matthew Issman, say in sworn statements that they suffered 
retribution after they testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala, an Atlanta office analyst with 32 years of experience,  
says he was demoted after word got out that he might talk to CNN 
for a program on IRS misconduct. After his April 1998 Senate 
testimony, Ayala says he was unfairly denied promotions and not 
permitted to complete work needed for higher-grade positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``My supervisor has advised other employees not to associate  
with me because I have reported IRS abuses to elected officials, I 
am a troublemaker, and it could damage their careers to be seen 
with me,'' Ayala's statement says. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS spokesman Steve Pyrek said the agency could not comment  
beyond what was in the court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, two top IRS officials in Texas -- acting Houston  
District Director Michael Greenspan and Regional Commissioner Ladd 
Ellis of Dallas -- have been placed on paid administrative leave 
while an investigation into Long's near-firing continues. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy IRS Commissioner Bob Wenzel this week installed top  
assistant Keith Jones as acting director of the Houston office. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memo to Houston employees, Wenzel said, ``We are trying to  
get to the bottom of a very serious allegation ... whether or not 
the handling of a specific employee situation constituted 
retaliation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Long said, ``Nothing will change. As soon as the press  
attention dies down, we'll go back to the way it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., is  
planning more hearings this fall focusing in part on the Houston 
district.

<HEADLINE> InterTrust To Work With MusicMatch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNNYVALE, Calif. (AP) -- InterTrust Technologies Corp. announced  
today that it will work with MusicMatch Inc., a leader in MP3 
software sales, to protect sales of music in digital format. 
</P>
<P>
	MP3 software has made it easy for consumers to copy near-CD  
quality music from their computers and trade it for free. But the 
technology offers little protection for artists and record 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego-based MusicMatch is the developer of MusicMatch  
Jukebox, an MP3 software program that lets users download digital 
music for a fee. The music can then be played on a personal 
computer or on the Diamond Rio and Creative NOMAD portable MP3 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	InterTrust, based in Sunnyvale, has developed software that can  
protect digital content, including MP3 files, over any digital 
media such as the Internet and DVD. 
</P>
<P>
	This collaboration ``is the first step toward moving the MP3  
market to where artists and labels can create, sell and 
persistently protect their content,'' said Victor Shear, chairman 
and chief executive officer of InterTrust. 
</P>
<P>
	MusicMatch will also participate in InterTrust's MP3Plus  
Developers Program, which assists developers in integrating digital 
rights management into their MP3 products.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Derby Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The state most commonly linked with  
thoroughbreds and racing has announced a plan to pair retired 
horses and jail inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton said Thursday that the state has  
donated 100 acres of farmland adjacent to a prison to become a home 
for retired thoroughbreds. 
</P>
<P>
	The facility, at the Blackburn Correctional Complex in  
Lexington, will become the home for 65 to 70 retired thoroughbreds 
in association with the New Jersey-based Thoroughbred Retirement 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The horses will be cared for by inmates from the complex under  
an innovative training program created by the foundation and 
already under way at correctional centers in New York and Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the guidance of qualified farm managers, as many as 50  
minimum-security inmates will receive training in horse care and 
stable management. Eventually, the prisoners will maintain the 
facility and take care of the horses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We in Kentucky believe that all horses deserve no less than  
humane treatment and the right to a meaningful and productive life, 
even after their racing careers have crossed the finish line,'' 
Patton said during a ceremony at Churchill Downs. ``This is a 
win-win-win situation for everybody involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know the horses will be better off. We believe the equine  
industry in Kentucky will take comfort knowing there is a facility 
of this kind in our state. And we are convinced the inmates will 
receive tremendous therapeutic benefits, develop emotional 
attachments to the animals and learn valuable skills that are in 
high demand here.'' 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	 *SHEIKH, RATTLE AND ROLL* It doesn't matter how Aljabr and  
Worldly Manner finish in the Kentucky Derby. Their owner, Sheikh 
Mohammed el Maktoum, is ready to chalk Saturday's race up to 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	The two colts will be Sheikh Mohammed's first Kentucky Derby  
entries after years coming to buy horses in the Bluegrass State. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first I might say I was disappointed, but then we'll take  
what we have learned and be ready for next year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither of the Godolphin Racing Inc. colts have raced in this  
country since last September and did not run in any serious Derby 
trials. Although they have worked several times since their arrival 
at Churchill Downs, their workouts have not been particularly 
impressive. 
</P>
<P>
	The most excitement out of their barn in the week leading up to  
the race came Thursday, when Sheikh Mohammed held court with a 
horde of curious reporters a day after his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	He assured the masses that no matter where the colts finish,  
he'll most certainly return. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a learning experience for us,'' he said. ``One thing I've  
learned is that I should arrive a little earlier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner worked five furlongs Thursday in 1:02, while  
Aljabr was clocked at 1:02 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FILLY FANATIC:* Should trainer Bob Baffert ultimately decide to  
run his impressive filly Excellent Meeting in the Derby, history 
indicates their chances are slim. 
</P>
<P>
	The same goes for four-time stakes winner Three Ring.  
</P>
<P>
	Only 36 fillies have started in the 124-year history of the  
race, and only three, Regret (1915), Genuine Risk (1980) and 
Winning Colors (1988) have won it. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning Colors finished third in the Preakness and sixth in the  
Belmont that year, joining Genuine Risk as the only fillies to run 
in all three Triple Crown races. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert said he would make a decision today on whether Excellent  
Meeting will run in the Kentucky Oaks or the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BAFFERT-SHEIKH* Bob Baffert recalled Thursday how he was  
grilled about the Derby by a curious Sheikh Mohammed at the Dubai 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't even discuss the Dubai World Cup,'' he said. ``I  
told him when you get there, you won't believe the excitement. You 
need to get there early and really enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was telling me today he couldn't believe the way people get  
involved in this race. He's like a kid. He's got the fever. And 
that's really neat. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a really down to earth guy. He's a defense minister and  
runs a country, but he just wants to hang with the trainers and be 
one of the guys. He's just really getting into this Derby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TICKET TROUBLES:* James Jackson, the owner of Valhol, plans to  
celebrate the Derby with family and friends. That opportunity did 
not, however, come cheap. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson found he needed about 30 tickets to take care of his  
entourage, which will include his five children. His box took care 
of six tickets and he was able to arrange for 12 more from the 
track at $175 each. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest he had to grab from other sources.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good wrestling match,'' Jackson said of the hunt. ``I  
had to go to the after-market (scalpers) to get the rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson would not divulge exactly how much it set him back.

<HEADLINE> R.I. Officials Arrested for Bribery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Two city officials have been charged  
with accepting at least $4,800 in bribes in exchange for lowering 
the property tax bills of an FBI informant. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Pannone, chairman of the city Board of Tax Assessment  
Review, and David Ead, the vice chairman, were charged Wednesday 
with conspiracy and money laundering. The board handles requests 
for reductions in property tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said other officials may have participated in the  
scheme. Agents also are investigating whether Providence officials 
accepted bribes from property owners who leased buildings to the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents raided City Hall and searched tax, planning and building  
inspection offices Wednesday morning, forcing the tax collector and 
tax assessor's office to close for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The money laundering charges stem from attempts to conceal the  
alleged bribes. Ead allegedly issued bogus invoices from his soda 
distribution business to disguise the bribes as legitimate payments 
for juice and soda. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether the men had attorneys who could comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The FBI covertly used video and audio tape to record more than  
100 conversations in which city officials accepted bribes from the 
informant over several months, according to a criminal compliant 
filed by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the affidavit, Ead told the informant to never  
mention ``checks'' on the telephone out of fear of wiretaps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Say this thing and that thing. Things mean money. We  
understand that,'' Ead allegedly said. ``When I talk to Joe 
(Pannone, I say) `I got the pizza here. It just came in.' He knows 
what I'm talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr. said he was not a target of the  
federal corruption probe, ``Operation Plunder Dome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to find any stains on this jacket,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In the 1980s, 21 people in his administration were convicted on  
corruption charges. Cianci was not among them.

<HEADLINE>  Health of Pens' Jagr Is Uncertain / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The return of Jaromir Jagr to the  
Pittsburgh Penguins' lineup is suddenly a little more iffy. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL's leading scorer didn't look good skating in the  
Penguins' practice in Pittsburgh on Thursday, sparking speculation 
that he would not be able to play Friday night in Game 5 of the 
best-of-7 first-round series that is tied at two games apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr, who has missed the last three games with a groin injury,  
left practice after about 15 minutes and went to the locker room 
where he rode a stationary bike. The media waited an hour to talk 
with him, but he walked by without comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 24 hours earlier, Jagr had said his condition had improved  
and that he expected to play, even though he would not be at 100 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr's return seemed more certain after the Devils evened the  
series with a 4-2 win at Pittsburgh on Tuesday night. It was New 
Jersey's best game of the series, and the return of Jagr was seen 
as a boost the Penguins' needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision now probably won't be made until either after the  
game-day skate on Friday morning at the Continental Airlines Arena 
or the pre-game skate roughly 45 minutes before game time. 
</P>
<P>
	If Jagr does play, the Devils plan to hit him every chance they  
get, within reason. That's playoff hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	Devils captain Scott Stevens expects Jagr to play.  
</P>
<P>
	``We want to finish our checks, but the bottom line is we want  
to play our game like the other night,'' Stevens said. ``If Jagr's 
back, that's fine. Yes, he's the player we have to watch, but we 
have to play the same way we did the last game. We have to play a 
convincing game, in people's faces, and make it uncomfortable for 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins' coach Kevin Constantine needs a better effort from his  
team, with or without Jagr, who had 127 points in winning his 
second straight scoring title and third in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``New Jersey outplayed us, and their motives may have been  
higher than ours,'' Constantine said after practice. ``But 
certainly ... we need to play better than we did in (Game 4). That 
was our fourth-best game of the four, and we hope to play our best 
in the five in New Jersey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins have posted a 2-1 record without Jagr. The key in  
the two wins has been their defense. The Devils have struggled to 
get odd-man rushes and Tom Barrasso has played well in goal, 
allowing nine goals. 
</P>
<P>
	That's made for a series that has been a lot closer than anyone  
expected. The Devils were the top seed in the Eastern Conference 
for the third straight year, while Pittsburgh slipped to the eighth 
seed after struggling down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not going to give us anything,'' Devils goaltender  
Martin Brodeur said. ``Sometimes when you come in as the first seed 
and you play the eighth seed, you feel you are going to get the 
chance to win. But these guys won't beat themselves. We are going 
to have to beat them and that's what's surprising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series will return to Pittsburgh on Sunday for Game 6. If a  
deciding game is necessary, it will be played here on Tuesday 
night.

<HEADLINE> Recruit Picks Arkansas Over Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Canton High basketball standout Alonzo  
Lane was apparently ready to agree to play for Mississippi until he 
received threatening phone calls, his coach said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane instead signed a national letter of intent with Arkansas on  
Thursday, three days after he canceled a news conference at which 
he was expected to name Ole Miss as his college choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The cancellation came after threats made to his home by callers  
who claimed to be from Oxford, home of the Ole Miss campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that (the threats) swayed him completely,'' Canton  
High coach Lewis Love said. ``I think he was about to sign with Ole 
Miss at the time. It's quite disturbing that somebody would do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have not been able to determine if the calls  
actually came from the Oxford area, or if the calls were a prank. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane said Thursday that he didn't want to talk about the threats  
and was just glad that the recruiting process was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't even explain how I feel, I'm overjoyed,'' Lane said.  
``After my visit I felt comfortable with them (Arkansas). It seemed 
like a good opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ole Miss coach Rod Barnes was out of town and unavailable for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane, a 6-foot-6, 245-pounder, was a Dandy Dozen pick by The  
Clarion-Ledger. He averaged 22 points, 15 rebounds and three 
blocked shots a game as a senior at Canton, which made him a 
heavily recruited prospect. 
</P>
<P>
	On at least two occasions, Lane verbally committed to  
Mississippi State, but never signed with the Bulldogs. He had also 
considered Murray State and Southern Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearl Lane, the player's mother, said earlier this week that the  
calls to their home included threats on her life and her son's life 
and talk about burning down the family home. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane told The Oxford Eagle on Thursday that the calls ``did have  
something to do'' with her son's decision to go to Arkansas instead 
of Ole Miss, but that ``he really just want to go to a bigger 
college.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Advance / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures advanced early today on  
the Chicago Board of Trade amid concerns about early planting 
weather and enthusiasm about a government policy change that could 
mean more exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans saw support from continued predictions by the  
National Weather Service that Midwest growing regions will see 
above-normal rainfall next week. The agency for the second time 
this week has predicted widespread rain that could further delay 
fieldwork, although some private forecasters continue to predict 
only scattered showers. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices also rose amid enthusiasm about the Clinton  
administration's decision to no longer include food and medicine in 
trade sanctions against foreign countries. That move could mean 
greater exports to Iran, which imports much of its farm products. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 1 1/2 cents to $2.65 a bushel; July  
corn rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.20 3/4 a bushel; July oats rose 1 3/4 cents to 
$1.20 3/4 a bushel; July soybeans rose 1/2 cent to $4.90 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell .02 cent to 63.55 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle rose .07 cent to 71.72 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell .38 cent to 58.67 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell .15 
cent to 59.40 cents a pound.

	Devils captain Scott Stevens expects Jagr to play.  
</P>
<P>
	``We want to finish our checks, but the bottom line is we want  
to play our game like the other night,'' Stevens said. ``If Jagr's 
back, that's fine. Yes, he's the player we have to watch, but we 
have to play the same way we did the last game. We have to play a 
convincing game, in people's faces, and make it uncomfortable for 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins' coach Kevin Constantine needs a better effort from his  
team, with or without Jagr, who had 127 points in winning his 
second straight scoring title and third in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``New Jersey outplayed us, and their motives may have been  
higher than ours,'' Constantine said after practice. ``But 
certainly ... we need to play better than we did in (Game 4). That 
was our fourth-best game of the four, and we hope to play our best 
in the five in New Jersey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins have posted a 2-1 record without Jagr. The key in  
the two wins has been their defense. The Devils have struggled to 
get odd-man rushes and Tom Barrasso has played well in goal, 
allowing nine goals. 
</P>
<P>
	That's made for a series that has been a lot closer than anyone  
expected. The Devils were the top seed in the Eastern Conference 
for the third straight year, while Pittsburgh slipped to the eighth 
seed after struggling down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not going to give us anything,'' Devils goaltender  
Martin Brodeur said. ``Sometimes when you come in as the first seed 
and you play the eighth seed, you feel you are going to get the 
chance to win. But these guys won't beat themselves. We are going 
to have to beat them and that's what's surprising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series will return to Pittsburgh on Sunday for Game 6. If a  
deciding game is necessary, it will be played here on Tuesday 
night.

<HEADLINE> No More Goats for Bob Baffert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Bob Baffert remembers going to Los  
Alamitos in California with four quarter horses and a goat in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goat was worth more than the horses,'' the trainer said  
Thursday outside Barn 33 at Churchill Downs, where he has 33 
thoroughbreds stabled. There are no goats. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the horses are Silver Charm and Real Quiet, with whom he  
won the past two Kentucky Derbys. There also are the filly 
Excellent Meeting, the colt Prime Timber and the gelding General 
Challenger, Baffert's three challengers for an unprecedented third 
straight victory in the race Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	For good measure, there also is the sensational filly  
Silverbulletday, who will be odds-on in the Kentucky Oaks Friday 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday is owned by Mike Pegram, also owner of Real  
Quiet, a friend of Baffert's, who talked him into training 
thoroughbreds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him if you can train a horse to go a quarter of a mile,  
you can train a horse to go a mile and a quarter,'' Pegram said. 
``You just have to work five times harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert, who turned to training thoroughbreds in 1991, has been  
on a roll since his first Derby starter, Cavonnier, finished a nose 
behind Grindstone, trainer D. Wayne Lukas' third Derby winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Baffert, who also has two barns full of horses at  
Santa Anita, sent out 538 starters for 138 wins, 91 seconds and 80 
thirds and earnings of $12,605,816. About a third of the earnings 
came at Churchill Downs on 20 wins, 10 seconds and eight thirds in 
50 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baffert's had a very strong hand in the past couple,'' said  
trainer Nick Zito, who will try to win a third Derby with Stephen 
Got Even and Adonis. ``He's been unbelievably great, but he still 
has to be lucky. . .'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been lucky,'' Baffert said on the morning after a full  
field of 20 3-year-olds was entered for the 125th Derby. ``I don't 
know what it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What it is besides hard work and luck is cooperative owners and  
a staff Baffert calls the best in racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Pegram and John Mabee, owner of Excellent Meeting, said it  
was up to Baffert on whether the fillies run in the Oaks or the 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting was entered in both races, although Mabee, who  
also owns General Challenge, said he preferred the Oaks. Baffert 
said he would make a final decision Friday, but appeared to be 
leaning toward the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	The entry of Excellent Meeting and General Challenge was made  
the 3-1 early favorite. Aaron Jones' Prime Timber, winner of the 
San Felipe and runner-up in the Santa Anita Derby, was next at 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert said he feels no pressure about trying to become the  
first person to be involved with three straight Derby winners. He 
is only the sixth to have a shot at it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think about just getting back,'' Baffert said. ``I know  
there's going to be a year when I don't have anything, I just try 
to stay calm and cool and enjoy the moment. The Derby's becomes a 
fun thing for me. It's like a vacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert's barn, as it was in 1997-98, has been a magnet for the  
media and the curious, who gather to gawk at the horses, ask 
questions and listens to Baffert's stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the one about Baffert working as a substitute teacher in  
his hometown of Nogales, Ariz., in 1977-78. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was making $20 a day, five days a week,'' he said. ``On  
weekends I'd go to Tucson and blow my check.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or how about the advice he gave to a high school history class?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care what you do, but if that door opens,'' he told  
the students, ``I want everybody looking down like they're 
studying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Baffert's entry, there will be the entry of Worldly  
Manner and Aljabr, owned by members of the ruling Maktoum family of 
Dubai, United Arab Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be a five-horse mutuel pool for betting purposes,  
comprised of Ecton Park, K One King, Kimberlite Pipe, Lemon Drop 
Kid and Valhol. 
</P>
<P>
	The fillies Excellent Meeting and Three Ring each will carry 121  
pounds; the others 126 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	The field for the Derby in post-position order is: Adonis, Jorge  
Chavez; Three Ring, John Velazquez; Ecton Park, Robbie Davis; 
Stephen Got Even, Chris McCarron; Aljabr, Daragh O'Donahue; 
Excellent Meeting, Kent Desormeaux; Desert Hero, Corey Nakatani; 
Answer Lively, Craig Perret; Valhol, Willie Martinez; K One King, 
Alex Solis; Cat Thief, Mike Smith; Worldly Manner, Jerry Bailey; 
Kimberlite Pipe, Robby Albarado; Prime Timber, David Flores; 
General Challenge, Gary Stevens; First American, Eddie 
Delahoussaye; Charismatic, Chris Antley; Vicar, Shane Sellers; 
Menifee, Pat Day, and Lemon Drop Kid, Jose Santos.

<HEADLINE> Teen Sentenced for 5 Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLNEY, Ill. (AP) -- A 17-year-old boy who admitted using a hammer  
to kill three children and two other people has been sentenced to 
life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Churchill of Noble, Ill., was 16 in February 1998  
when he killed his half-brother, Jonathan Lloyd, along with Lloyd's 
35-year-old girlfriend and her three young children -- ages 12, 10 
and 6 -- at their rural Richland County home. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill also admitted having sex with one of the children as  
she lay dying, and sexually molesting two other bodies. He then 
bathed before leaving the house with cash, cigarettes, alcohol and 
compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill was not eligible for the death penalty because of his  
age. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will live out the rest of his life in prison, which is a  
fitting punishment for someone who would commit such violent and 
senseless crimes,'' prosecutor David Rands said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a videotaped statement played at his trial, Churchill told  
police that he had fantasized about killing Lloyd for more than a 
year to release pent-up aggression. He said he ``acted out a little 
anger'' on the others on impulse because they teased him, and 
because one child broke one of his CDs.

<HEADLINE> Retail Mutual Fund Assets Fall / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds decreased by $16.47 billion to $858.49 billion in the 
latest week, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category  
decreased by $9.75 billion to $713.17 billion for the week ended 
Wednesday, the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. 
Tax-exempt fund assets decreased by $6.72 billion to $145.32 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds decreased by $7.55  
billion to $576.80 billion for the same period. Among institutional 
funds, taxable money market fund assets decreased by $7.69 billion 
to $532.33 billion while assets of tax-exempt funds increased by 
$134.5 million to $44.47 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.435 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.459 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell to  
4.28 percent in the week ended Tuesday from 4.30 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield fell to 4.32 percent from 4.34 percent, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield fell to 4.37 percent from 4.40  
percent, while the 30-day compounded yield fell to 4.41 percent 
from 4.43 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds  
remained unchanged from the previous week at 61 days, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts held steady at 2.10 
percent as of Wednesday, compared with the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the annual  
percentage yield available on interest-bearing checking accounts 
fell to 0.93 percent from 0.94 percent a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank Rate Monitor said the annual percentage yield rose to 4.13  
percent from 4.12 percent on six-month certificates of deposit. The 
yield fell on 1-year CDs to 4.34 percent from 4.36 percent, while 
it rose on 2 1/2-year CDs to 4.47 percent from 4.45 percent. The yield 
also rose on 5-year CDs, to 4.63 percent from 4.61 percent.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Court Delays Riot Case Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- The Michigan Supreme Court on Thursday  
indefinitely postponed an order requiring 11 news organizations to 
turn over unpublished photographs and video of a riot at Michigan 
State University. 
</P>
<P>
	News organizations had until Friday to turn over the materials,  
which prosecutors say they need to investigate the riot that 
occurred March 27 and 28 after Michigan State's loss in the NCAA 
basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a ruling released late Thursday, the state Supreme Court  
postponed the deadline while it considers whether to hear an appeal 
from the news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Herschel Fink, an attorney for the Detroit Free Press, said that  
if the state Supreme Court refuses to grant an appeal, the media 
outlets may not pursue the case any further. 
</P>
<P>
	The news outlets contend that turning over unpublished photos  
and video would compromise their ability to gather the news. Fink 
has said that such orders place reporters in jeopardy by forcing 
them to act as agents of the police. 
</P>
<P>
	Two lower court judges have ruled the materials aren't protected  
because the riot was filmed in a public place and media laws are 
only meant to protect confidential sources. The judges have also 
ruled that people filming the riot were witnesses to crimes and are 
therefore compelled to give evidence to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Free Press, media involved in the case are  
the Lansing State Journal, The State News -- Michigan State's 
student newspaper -- and eight television stations.

<HEADLINE> Timing Treatments for Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``Prepare for morning,'' say the ads showing a  
startled Dagwood, of comic-strip fame, leaping out of bed as the 
alarm rings. It's a catchy attempt to sell a new blood pressure 
medicine, but underlying the cartoon is a serious message: 
</P>
<P>
	Our bodies have internal rhythms that make certain diseases  
worse at certain times of the day -- and that make crucial the 
question of when to take medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider blood pressure, which in the majority of people surges  
in the early morning hours, just when they're awakening. For 
hypertension patients, that surge is dangerous: Heart attacks and 
strokes occur most frequently during those morning hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Hence the ads for Schwarz Pharma's Verelan PM. Recently approved  
by the Food and Drug Administration, one takes it at bedtime -- but 
the hypertension drug is specially coated so it won't reach peak 
strength until around 6 a.m., when it's most needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug illustrates ``chronotherapy'' -- using people's internal  
biological rhythms to treat disease more effectively, and even 
minimize side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most doctors are not completely familiar with the fact that  
when we take medicines is critical'' to how well they work, said 
chronobiology expert Michael Smolensky of the University of Texas, 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not a routine part of medical training, but pharmaceutical  
companies are intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe you're going to see a lot more of this,'' said  
Smolensky, who is organizing an international meeting of 
chronotherapy researchers and pharmaceutical scientists in 
Williamsburg, Va., in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone has an internal clock, determined by genes, that  
affects our health, even our moods. Many of these biological 
rhythms are ``circadian,'' meaning they fluctuate on a 24-hour 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Many medications for serious or chronic diseases are designed to  
keep steady drug levels in the bloodstream, either by taking a 
long-lasting pill once a day, usually in the morning, or by taking 
pills several times a day. 
</P>
<P>
	But circadian patterns can have a profound influence on certain  
diseases, suggesting some medications could be better timed, 
Smolensky explained. He listed research that found: 
</P>
<P>
	--Asthma attacks often occur at night, and usually are more  
severe at night. Some asthma patients have cut nighttime attacks in 
half by taking formulations of theophylline in the early evening, 
timed to provide enough medication to get them through the night. 
</P>
<P>
	--The stomach secretes more acid at night, so doctors may  
recommend that ulcer patients take certain acid-blocking drugs with 
dinner instead of earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	--One type of cholesterol medicine, the ``statin'' drugs, works  
better when given in the evening because it targets a 
cholesterol-affecting liver enzyme that is most active at night. 
</P>
<P>
	--A corticosteroid called Medrol is given every other morning,  
when the body is primed to accept more of the inflammation-fighting 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
	--New French studies suggest taking antihistamines before bed  
better controls hay fever, which tends to be worse first thing in 
the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	--Even cancer may prove open to chronotherapy. Ongoing studies  
are examining whether pumping certain anti-cancer drugs into 
colorectal cancer patients while they sleep at night could cause 
fewer side effects, thus letting doctors use higher doses. 
</P>
<P>
	The catch: These results are based on people who are awake in  
the day and asleep at night. Night workers who sleep all day may 
have opposite patterns, and shift workers can be even more complex. 
</P>
<P>
	The rhythms of hypertension are best understood -- even laymen  
are likely to have heard about the risk of early morning heart 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	But the big question is whether more medicine to fight that  
morning blood pressure surge actually translates into fewer heart 
attacks than using regular medicine. Smolensky said 
chronobiologists are anxiously awaiting results of a 15,000-patient 
study comparing another FDA-approved chronotherapy -- Searle 
Pharmaceuticals' Covera HS -- to regular blood pressure pills to 
tell. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Smolensky hopes advertising for Covera-HS and  
its new Verelan PM competitor will educate more doctors about 
chronobiology, so they'll look for disease patterns in their own 
patients.

<HEADLINE> Sales of New Homes Rise 2.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of new homes rose 2.1 percent in March,  
the first increase in four months, as the biggest jump in activity 
in the West in four years offset weakness in the rest of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported today that sales of new  
single-family homes climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
909,000 units in March following a 2 percent decline in February. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first advance in new-home sales since November, when  
they hit an all-time record rate of 985,000 annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The March increase was a surprise to economists, who had been  
expecting a slight decline, believing after a burst of activity 
last year that the housing industry would pause for a breather. 
</P>
<P>
	But low unemployment, high stock prices and low mortgage rates  
are all positive factors supporting consumers' demand for homes. 
Sales of existing homes also rose in March to a record annual rate 
of 5.05 million units. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgage rates, while off their recent lows, have remained at  
levels that are still attractive for prospective buyers. Freddie 
Mac, the mortgage company, reported today that 30-year, fixed-rate 
mortgages rose to 6.93 percent this week, up from 6.88 percent last 
week and a two-month low of 6.87 the week before that. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall increase in new-home sales reflected a huge, 24  
percent jump in sales in the West, the biggest one-month gain for 
that region since a 31 percent rise in March 1995. The increase 
pushed sales up in the West to an annual rate of 221,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were down in the rest of the country. The Midwest suffered  
the biggest decline, a 6.4 percent drop to an annual rate of 
161,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell 4.8 percent in the South to an annual rate of 395,000  
units and were down 2.5 percent in the Northeast to a sales pace of 
79,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
	The average price for new homes sold in March rose to a record  
$188,800, an increase 0.5 percent from February's 187,800 average 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	The median price for new homes, meaning half the homes sold in  
March sold for more and half for less, was $153,000, a drop of 1.5 
percent from February's median sales price of $155,400.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Want To Produce Spring Lamb / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- West Virginia University researchers  
and sheep farmers in six counties may have found a way to 
capitalize on the forces of supply and demand: Outsmart Mother 
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	By getting their ewes to give birth in the fall instead of the  
spring, farmers could deliver lamb to market before Easter, when 
supply is low and prices are high. 
</P>
<P>
	More than one year into WVU's three-year experiment, there is  
some success. On participating farms, 60 percent of the flock 
delivered lambs in the fall, WVU professor Keith Inskeep said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1940s, there were about 1 million sheep in West  
Virginia and 50 million nationwide. Today, there are about 48,000 
in the state and just 5.8 million in the country, Inskeep said. 
</P>
<P>
	Imported wool, the growing costs of labor, land and fencing, and  
an increasing threat from predators contributed to the decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting ewes to breed with rams out of season is sometimes as  
easy as putting them together, Inskeep said. That stimulates two 
ovulation periods, followed by a normal cycle, then breeding in 
about 20 days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But WVU's project also involves hormone treatments to speed  
things along. 
</P>
<P>
	A plastic device that emits progesterone -- the same hormone used  
in women's birth control pills -- is inserted in the sheep for five 
to 12 days, then withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of tunes up the reproductive system,'' then prepares  
the ewe for breeding, Inskeep said. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal of the research is to get all ewes on a single farm  
breeding within a 24- to 48-hour period, which would synchronize 
the births to within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Nature also plays a part: Farmers are keeping sheep that breed  
out of season, along with those born out of season, to change the 
mating patterns over the long term. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Harsh, who has about 200 sheep on his farm in Eglon, is  
happy to have WVU's help on his farm, where about 75 percent of the 
flock had lambs in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting most of them to breed at the same time is the biggest  
problem. Some of them just won't do it,'' Harsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	But when they do, Harsh benefits. By selling lamb in January, he  
can command twice the price he ordinarily gets, about $1.20 per 
pound instead of 60 cents to 70 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Last year's wildfires apparently cut into  
the libidos of cattle in central Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranchers say the number of calves born this spring is down as  
much as 40 percent in some parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had your summer heat and all that fire and smoke,'' said  
Don LeFils Jr., president of the Volusia Cattleman's Association. 
``It just stressed them out, and we're suffering for it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Gamble, Volusia County's livestock extension agent, said  
the countywide average could be as high as 40 percent, which would 
translate into 2,000 fewer calves. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower birth rate in Volusia County, which has about 15,000  
cows, is probably extreme because the county was one of the hardest 
hit by last year's fires, which burned 500,000 acres statewide. 
Agriculture officials, however, still expect to see a drop in calf 
births this year because of disruptions in cattle breeding 
patterns.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines Suffers Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Alaska Airlines has canceled more than 100  
flights since Tuesday, citing what appears to be an illegal 
slowdown by its mechanics' union. 
</P>
<P>
	Mechanics are taking longer than expected to repair planes,  
leaving aircraft unready for takeoff, said airline spokesman Jack 
Evans in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, 35 flights were canceled Tuesday, 52 were canceled  
Wednesday and 28 had been canceled by midmorning Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cancellations usually number about five a day.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the mechanics' union -- the Airline Mechanics  
Fraternal Association -- did not immediately return a call for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Alaska has been able to accommodate passengers from the  
canceled flights on other airplanes, Evans said, adding that 
travelers are being asked to double-check arrival and departure 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based airline has maintenance bases in Seattle and  
Oakland. It schedules nearly 500 departures a day on its West Coast 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
	AMFA has been in contract talks with the airline since last  
summer. At an April 16 rally, union members complained about the 
slow pace of talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's contract came up for amendment in 1997, when the  
mechanics were represented by the International Association of 
Machinists, Evans said. Since then, the mechanics have certified 
AMFA to represent them, and talks with that union resumed last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides recently requested a federal mediator, Evans said,  
and talks with the intermediary are to resume in late May.

<HEADLINE> Arrest Near in Colorado School Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Authorities are on the verge of  
arresting a man who allegedly sold the semiautomatic handgun used 
in the Columbine High School massacre, the prosecutor said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be an arrest in this case,'' Jefferson County  
District Attorney David Thomas told NBC's ``Today'' show. He said 
authorities are discussing the man's surrender with his attorney, 
and it would probably take place in the next two days. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the man would be charged with violating a law against  
selling handguns to minors. The sale of the semiautomatic TEC DC-9 
was a ``private transaction,'' he said. The transaction was made 
before the older gunman turned 18 earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the seller could face accessory to murder charges,  
Davis said it would depend on whether he knew if the killers had 
planned to use the gun in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, hiding their arsenal  
under black trench coats, killed 13 people and wounded 23 others at 
the school April 20 before killing themselves. They had four guns 
and left more than 50 bombs at the school and in their homes. A 
diary indicates the plot had been planned for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas did not indicate which teen was believed to have bought  
the gun or how he or they knew the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Post reported today that federal Bureau of Alcohol,  
Tobacco and Firearms agents on Tuesday visited the pizza shop where 
Harris and Klebold worked. It quoted unidentified sources as saying 
a pizza delivery driver may have introduced Harris and Klebold to 
the seller. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of the Blackjack Pizza shop, Christopher Lau, wouldn't  
comment except to say, ``We are cooperating with investigators in 
every possible way and will continue to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the three other guns -- two shotguns and a rifle  
-- used in the massacre were bought by Robyn Anderson, Klebold's 
girlfriend, shortly after she turned 18 last November. They 
describe her as a witness rather than a suspect in the rampage, 
because it is not illegal to provide a shotgun or a rifle to a 
minor. 
</P>
<P>
	``She did buy the long guns,'' sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis  
said. ``Did she supply the weapons to them with some idea of what 
they were planning to do with them? That's still one of the major 
things we want to find out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said at least one was bought at a gun show.  
Federal law allows 18-year-olds to buy rifles and shotguns from 
licensed dealers, but not handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeated efforts to reach Ms. Anderson at home and by phone for  
comment have been unsuccessful. Investigators say she has retained 
an attorney and has been cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson, who attended the prom with Klebold days before the  
shootings, is just one of 600-plus leads being pursued in 
Colorado's largest-ever criminal probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of those 600 could throw anybody back into the focus of  
the investigation,'' Davis said. ``We're conducting this 
investigation as if there are more suspects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners drained by a week of funerals turned today to the final  
service for the Columbine victims. Witnesses said the gunmen killed 
Isaiah Shoels, 18, because he was black. 
</P>
<P>
	Anguished by the bloodshed at Columbine, people across the  
country are talking about school safety, parental responsibility, 
gun control and violence in movies, music and video games. With 
Vice President Al Gore in attendance, cable network MSNBC staged a 
town meeting Wednesday night focusing on the shootings, and CNN 
planned its own tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack has also produced a disturbing series of copycat  
crimes, including Wednesday's shooting of two 17-year-old boys at a 
Taber, Alberta, high school. One of the boys died after a 
14-year-old boy walked into the school and opened fire, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, educators have increased security and at least a  
half-dozen law enforcement agencies have arrested youngsters 
accused of plotting weapons attacks at school. A number of school 
districts have banned trench coats. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same school district as Columbine, a bomb threat on  
Wednesday forced students to evacuate Pomona High School. No 
explosives were found. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wackos are coming out of the woodwork,'' said another  
sheriff's spokesman, Sgt. Jim Parr. ``A lot of sick people think 
this is something to emulate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the leads is the medical problem cited by the Marines  
Corps when it rejected Harris as a recruit just five days before 
the attack. Harris was rejected because he had been taking the 
antidepressant drug Luvox, The New York Times reported today, 
citing a Defense Department source. Luvox is often used to treat 
obsessive-compulsive disorder in children and adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they were interested in whether Harris'  
condition could be linked to the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``His acceptance or nonacceptance into the Marine Corps I don't  
think has any bearing on what happened,'' Parr said. ``But if he 
were on medication or not on medication, that would be part of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coroner's office said tests showed no drugs or alcohol in  
the bodies of the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, a federal official told The Associated Press  
that the FBI has enhanced a surveillance videotape that captured 
events in the cafeteria, where several students were wounded during 
the rampage. The tape was returned to Colorado for analysis.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton OKs Schools Flexibility Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed legislation today  
giving states greater freedom in spending federal education dollars 
-- a modest achievement by Republicans and Democrats that was 
accorded a Rose Garden ceremony to showcase possibilities for 
bipartisanship. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, there have been days in the last few years when I'm  
not sure we could have gotten this many members of Congress to 
agree that today is Thursday,'' Clinton joked as he surveyed the 
dozen or more lawmakers witnessing his enactment of the ``Ed-Flex'' 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope now we're getting off to a good start and we'll keep on  
doing this,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar spirit, Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., said, ``I hope  
this is simply the first accomplishment. ... We must continue along 
this path'' of working together to improve schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Remarks from both sides of the aisle, however, suggested that  
was no sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Flexibility Partnership Act allows all states to  
receive waivers of certain federal education requirements in order 
to improve school and student performance. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton, before painstakingly marking his signature on the  
bill with more than a dozen pens that would become the lawmakers' 
souvenirs, threatened to undo the legislation if it didn't work the 
way Republican sponsors promised. 
</P>
<P>
	If states and school districts did not use their new flexibility  
to produce measurable results, Clinton said, ``and the money's 
being misspent under this law, then we'll revert to another 
system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pressed the GOP majority in Congress to take up his own  
education agenda: massive new federal funds for hiring teachers, 
modernizing and building schools, and testing students against 
national standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, in turn, criticized the Democrats' agenda as a  
``one-size-fits-all'' approach to fixing the nation's schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge President Clinton and his colleagues in Congress to  
help us to eliminate the federal middleman in Washington and 
empower our teachers and parents to improve public education at the 
local level,'' Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., chairman of the House 
Republican Conference, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed-Flex, which was the first substantive bill to emerge from the  
post-impeachment Congress, was approved overwhelmingly in the House 
and Senate last week. Its passage was cheered by Republicans who 
advocate allowing more local authority over nearly $11 billion in 
education spending this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation expands to all 50 states and the District of  
Columbia a program established in 1994 that freed 12 states and 
school districts from some rules for obtaining federal funds and 
let them establish their own programs under which they would be 
accountable for academic results. 
</P>
<P>
	It authorizes the Education Secretary to deny Ed-Flex status to  
states that fail to develop strict standards and assessments for 
measuring the progress of students and school districts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called for an expansion of the Ed-Flex pilot program  
last year in a speech to the National Governors' Association. 
</P>
<P>
	To stave off a threatened presidential veto, Republicans had to  
give up a provision allowing a portion of the $1.2 billion in this 
year's budget for Clinton's new teacher program to be used for 
special education needs. Instead, the bill says school districts 
with class sizes of 18 or fewer students may join with other 
districts to use the money for teacher training.

<HEADLINE> Dinosaurs' Culinary Habits Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Huge, long-necked dinosaurs that were the  
largest animals ever to walk the Earth may be seen in movies 
plucking leaves from the tallest trees, but a new study says they 
could hardly raise their heads above their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Parrish, a researcher at Northern Illinois University,  
reports today in the journal Science that a computer simulation 
shows that the head movements of two long-necked dinosaurs, 
diplodocus and apatosaurus, were much more limited than once 
believed. Apatosaurus was once called brontosaurus and is one of 
the best known of dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish said he and a colleague used fossil bones of the two  
animals to create computer models that could depict their neck and 
head motions. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that even though the dinosaurs had necks that could be  
40 feet or more long, the animals could not raise their heads much 
above 9 to 12 feet above the ground. For the most part, he said, 
they held their heads straight out or down -- not up. 
</P>
<P>
	``The maximum amount they were able to raise their heads was  
just a little bit above the height of their back,'' said Parrish. 
``If you raise the neck any higher, the vertebrae run into each 
other and the back locks up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This contradicts the popular view that the long-necked dinosaurs  
routinely cropped leaves from the top of trees and were able to 
stand on their hind legs to reach the highest limbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a surprising result,'' said Parrish. ``We didn't think  
there would be any problem with them raising their heads, but it 
turns out there is a real, physical limit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish added: ``I don't think our study answers whether they  
could rise up on their hind legs, but if they did there would be a 
blood pressure problem. I don't think they would use that as a 
predominant way of feeding, as some people have suggested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two animals studied are in a group known as sauropods,  
massive animals with long tails, long necks and small heads. 
</P>
<P>
	The apatosaurus, for instance, is thought to have weighed up to  
100 tons, stood up to 70 feet high and had a tail-to-head length of 
about 130 feet. Sauropods lived from 200 million to 65 million 
years ago and were one of the most successful animals that ever 
existed. Sauropod fossils are the most common in just about every 
one of the ancient ecosystems, said Parrish. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, scientists have depicted the animals as browsing from  
high vegetation or swimming in pools with their long necks sticking 
up like living periscopes. Many museums with sauropod fossils 
display the animal with the head held high. 
</P>
<P>
	But Parrish said there long have been doubts that the animals'  
hearts were strong enough to pump blood up the long necks to the 
head. Some researchers even suggested double hearts as a solution 
to this problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study, though, shows that neck bones kept the sauropods  
from raising their heads. The bones favor a position where the head 
was low, swinging from side to side for grazing. And they always 
were grazing. 
</P>
<P>
	``These animals were so big they had to eat almost constantly to  
get enough energy,'' said Parrish. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Keith Rigby Jr., a paleontologist at the University of Notre  
Dame, said he was happy to see some researcher was, at last, 
``taking a serious look at what has been accepted as dogma in the 
past. I am not surprised at his findings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rigby said that he and other researchers have long suspected  
that some of the assumptions about how well the sauropods could 
move their heads ``violated a whole group of biophysical laws.''

<P>
	Bush formed his presidential committee in early March, raising  
$7.6 million in 28 days, a pace of $271,000 a day, according to the 
March 31 report filed with the Federal Election Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Bush's father, the former president, attended a  
fund-raising event for Bush in Arizona, and his exploratory 
committee has continued its other fund-raising work. Bush himself 
has attended no fund-raising events thus far. 
</P>
<P>
	Several recent national opinion polls have made Bush a  
front-runner for the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Morning News, Bush told Virginia fund-raisers  
in a conference call this week that he had banked $11 million so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
	That would put the Republican governor on a pace to reach $20  
million by the end of June, a target advisors privately said 
earlier this year they hoped to reach. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is considering bypassing federal campaign funds for next  
year's GOP primaries. Such action would allow him to ignore 
spending limits in next year's presidential primary states.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Give Farewell Bonuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- All but five of the 42 House members who left  
office early this year gave their staffers goodbye bonuses, The 
Associated Press found. The total reached nearly $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Rep. Bill Hefner, D-N.C., led the group by giving his 13  
staffers $119,100 in bonuses. Most of his aides left with about 
$10,000 each in extra pay in his last three months in office. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice is legal but sharply criticized by taxpayer  
advocates and other watchdog groups. They say lawmakers should try 
to return leftover office allocations to the Treasury rather than 
use them to boost salaries for aides. 
</P>
<P>
	``Members of Congress often spend taxpayers' money as if it were  
like water,'' said Gary Ruskin, director of the Congressional 
Accountability Project. ``But we work very hard to generate the tax 
dollars to give the federal government the money needed to run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An AP computerized review of monthly House payroll sheets found  
37 members who gave boosts to six or more employees before leaving 
office early this year. The AP review covered 718 employees for the 
42 members who retired, resigned, sought other offices or got 
defeated in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members attributed the extra pay to heavier workloads,  
while others considered it a reward for years of loyalty and hard 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	``My staff had been a good bargain to the constituents, and I  
felt like giving them what I could legally give them,'' Hefner 
said. ``They did their job throughout the year. They went through a 
lot of headaches and worked fair and hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he thought it was right to use the money that way,  
Hefner said, ``I just don't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., gave staffers $1,000  
to $5,125 apiece in extra pay -- in most cases the equivalent of one 
or two months' salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich spokesman Mike Shields said the boosts were consistent  
with those that Gingrich paid in past years to reward staffers for 
good work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any insinuation that this had something to do with the fact  
that he was leaving and wouldn't be held accountable is very narrow 
and misguided,'' Shields said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., who as House Appropriations  
Committee chairman once brought a 2-foot-long machete to a hearing 
to stress his commitment to slashing the federal budget, gave most 
employees an extra $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston, who resigned in February, did not return phone calls  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice of giving year-end boosts occurs among returning  
members as well, but congressional critics said term-end bonuses 
are particularly egregious because the lawmakers who give them will 
no longer be accountable to voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Pappas, R-N.J., one of six House incumbents defeated for  
re-election, gave staffers more than $74,000 in extra pay since 
Election Day to ``help them through a period when their own future 
was very uncertain.'' He acknowledged that had he returned, 
``certainly that would not have occurred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some bonuses were doled out as a one-time, lump-sum payment,  
while others were given by temporarily increasing the staffer's 
annual pay rate for one or more months. Some members gave both 
forms of bonuses. Because aides leave the payroll when the member 
leaves office, the special pay rate does not carry over into the 
new term. 
</P>
<P>
	The bonus total is the amount beyond what aides would have  
received had their Sept. 30, 1998, salary rate remained in place 
through Jan. 3, 1999, the end of the term. Extra pay identified on 
the payroll sheets as overtime or payment for unused vacation time 
were excluded. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the AP analysis, Democrats were generally more  
generous, giving out average boosts of $2,290, compared with $1,880 
for Republicans. Members retiring or resigning also tended to give 
larger bonuses than those who were defeated or left to pursue other 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve members gave bonuses totaling $50,000 or more in the  
closing months, and 14 others gave $20,000 or more. Nearly 200 
people got at least one month's extra pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Scotty Baesler, D-Ky., said some people may consider the bonuses  
an effort to spend down his account, but he prefers to call them 
``a reward for employees for the good work they have done.''

<HEADLINE> Female Trainer Seeks Derby History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Akiko Gothard is not your typical horse  
trainer: She dodged bombs in Tokyo during World War II, once owned 
the great John Henry and earned degrees in psychology and English 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the 68-year-old trainer will attempt to become the  
first female trainer to win the Kentucky Derby when she saddles K 
One King. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all very exciting,'' said Gothard, who arrived in the  
United States in 1957, became a bloodstock agent in 1970 and got 
her training license in 1993. ``I'd love to win this race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	K One King, part of the five-horse mutuel field at 12-1, has  
trained well this week at Churchill Downs, with two impressive 
workouts. The colt is coming off a second-place finish in the 
Gallery Furniture.com Stakes at Turfway Park and has four wins and 
three seconds in seven career starts, all at Kentucky tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before the Gallery Furniture.com, K One King was purchased  
from Yoshiko Sato by Allen and Madeleine Paulson for a reported 
$1.6 million. The Paulsons stuck with Gothard. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's done a nice job,'' Madeleine Paulson said. ``You have to  
give her credit. They're a good combination. And it's fun to have a 
female trainer to call in the morning. We see things differently. I 
think it's an advantage. Some men may not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gothard is the ninth female to train a Derby horse, the fourth  
in the 1990s. Last year, the Kathy Walsh-trained Hanuman Highway 
finished seventh. Cynthia Reese's In Contention was 15th in 1996 
and Shelley Riley's Casual Lies was second in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I want to do is get results,'' Gothard said. ``That's what  
matters most, not that I'm a woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Growing up in Tokyo during World War II, her family's home was  
leveled by bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you are a child, amazingly, you can adapt,'' she said.  
``My house was bombed. My neighborhood was destroyed -- I could see 
miles away. War is a terrible thing, but I didn't suffer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1957, Gothard came to Kentucky with her then-husband Donald  
McVarish, a professor in childhood development. She studied 
advanced psychology at the University of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1970, when the Japanese began buying American horses, Gothard  
was sought out as an interpreter, and was hired as a bloodstock 
agent. She eventually went out on her own, and is still a regular 
at horse sales in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Keeneland yearling sales in 1976, she bought a horse for  
$1,100 -- his name was John Henry. He was a bit frisky, so Gothard 
had him gelded and then sold him for $25,000 before he ran a race. 
Who knew John Henry would become a champion and earn more than $6.5 
million? 
</P>
<P>
	Gothard divorced in 1975, and married stockbroker Marvin Gothard  
in 1984. They trained horses until his death in 1995, and Akiko 
Gothard kept the stable going. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Gothard takes her Derby shot with K One King.  
</P>
<P>
	``I will try my best to get him ready,'' Gothard said,  
``although there's not much you can do at this point but pray.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fights Global Software Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States is making progress in  
combating software piracy around the world but the problem remains 
unacceptably widespread, a Clinton administration official said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart Eizenstat, undersecretary of state for economic affairs,  
cited the Middle East states and even developed countries such as 
Spain for violating international treaties on intellectual property 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying before a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee, he  
warned the United States would seek action by the World Trade 
Organization against countries that did not comply with those 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky was expected to  
announce Friday which countries the United States is closely 
monitoring for piracy of computer software, videos, CDs, CD-ROMS 
and digital video discs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where our important commercial interests are threatened we  
will not hesitate to use the WTO dispute mechanism to hold others 
to the same commitments we have to meet,'' Eizenstat said. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the Foreign Relations subcommittee on international  
economic policy that intellectual property piracy cost the U.S. 
software industry an estimated $11 billion in lost revenues in 
1997, the last year for which figures were available. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., the subcommittee chairman, said the  
United States is losing jobs, income and tax revenue to 
international software piracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this trend continues, the status of the U.S. software  
industry as the world leader is in jeopardy,'' Hagel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eizenstat said many people ``who otherwise consider themselves  
law-abiding citizens routinely copy software for a family member, 
friend or co-worker,'' a practice he compared to shoplifting. 
</P>
<P>
	He said many foreign countries are unwilling to prosecute  
violators, even when they are large companies or governments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly developing countries are finding this a difficult  
task, especially in the enforcement area,'' Eizenstat said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said piracy rates were intolerably high in the Middle East  
and singled out Kuwait as the only WTO member without formal 
copyright legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said rates also were excessive in many developed  
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite our and the industry's efforts, the rate of piracy of  
business software applications in Spain has hovered near 60 percent 
for two years,'' he said.

	NATO Jets Target Montenegro  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO warplanes hammered at targets  
across Serbia and its junior partner Montenegro today on the 37th 
day of its air campaign but accidentally struck Bulgaria's capital 
when one of its missiles went awry. Nobody was hurt but Bulgarian 
President Petar Stoyanov urged citizens not to panic and demanded 
an explanation from NATO about what happened. Refugees fleeing 
Kosovo, meanwhile, told of seeing piles of bodies of men who had 
been detained and apparently executed by Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic's forces.

	Colo. Prosecutors Near Arrest  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Authorities are on the verge of  
arresting a man who allegedly provided a gun used in the Columbine 
High School massacre, the county prosecutor said today. ``There 
will be an arrest in this case,'' Jefferson County District 
Attorney David Thomas told NBC's ``Today'' show. He said 
authorities are discussing the man's surrender with his attorney 
and it will probably take place in the next two days. He said the 
man will be charged with violating law against selling handguns to 
minors.

	British Gunman Fires Into College  
</P>
<P>
	GLOUCESTER, England (AP) -- A teen-age gunman fired three shots  
into a college classroom filled with students this morning in 
Britain before running away. No one was injured. Police, who 
evacuated 18 female students from the Gloucestershire College of 
Art and Technology in southwest England, said the youth fired 
through an open window. Police later arrested a 16-year-old, 
believed to be a student at the college. The weapon was almost 
certainly illegal. Britain imposed a near-total ban on handguns 
after Thomas Hamilton used four legally owned guns to kill 16 
kindergarten children in Dunblane, Scotland.

	Wages, Benefits Rising Slowly  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wages and benefits for American workers rose a  
slight 0.4 percent in the first three months of the year, the 
smallest amount on record, indicating the lowest unemployment in 
three decades is still not generating wage pressures. The 0.4 
percent increase reported today in the Labor Department's 
Employment Cost Benefit was just half the 0.8 percent advance that 
private economists had been expecting. The first-quarter gain 
followed a much larger, 0.7 percent advance from October through 
December of last year.

very bad things before in my life. Now it is time to bear the 
consequences of my actions,'' Comrade Duch told the Hong Kong-based 
Far Eastern Economic Review. Duch disappeared in 1979 and was 
presumed dead. In fact, he converted to Christianity in 1993 and

delay a decision on statehood until after Israel's May 17 election. 
The vote came on the third day of debate by the PLO's Central 
Council on whether to declare statehood May 4. The decision not to 
decide for now gives Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat new room to 
maneuver at a critical time when Israeli voters are closely 
watching his every move.

were misdiagnosed and suffer from cancer they were told they did 
not have. ``We feel shock, anger, disbelief -- there's nothing we 
can do,'' said the wife of one patient. She said her husband was 
told by Sturdy Memorial Hospital that his test had been 
inaccurately reported by a former pathologist and he was advised to 
seek aggressive radiation therapy. The flawed exams were performed

<HEADLINE> As Heroin Prices Drop, Use Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Heroin prices dropped in half from the late  
1980s to mid-1990s, driving up use by addicts, a study finds. 
</P>
<P>
	The results are significant because they suggest addicts are  
sensitive to price fluctuations, meaning drug policy that drives up 
prices could stem drug use even among hard-core users, said the 
study's author, Dr. Peter Bach, who did his work at the University 
of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of evidence that casual users are  
price-sensitive. The question is whether it affects hard-core 
users. Are hard-core users going to do whatever they need to do to 
get what they need?'' said Bach, whose research is published in the 
May issue of the American Journal of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	While the price dropped overall, at certain points it increased.  
When price increased, demand dropped, Bach said. The research was 
conducted in 19 major cities from 1988 to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did price drop, but during that seven-year period, the  
amount of pure heroin found in a $100 dose tripled, the study 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	The study gauged heroin use by measuring use of methadone, which  
is used to stabilize addicts. The more heroin someone has consumed, 
the more methadone they need. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the White House Office of National Drug Control  
Policy hadn't seen the study but were skeptical of its findings, 
said spokesman Bob Weiner. Other researchers have failed to 
establish the link between price and drug use, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study also found large differences in heroin prices  
among cities. It was most expensive in Atlanta, where $100 would 
buy just 77 milligrams in 1995, and cheapest in New York and 
Philadelphia, where a buyer could get about 316 milligrams for 
$100. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, $100 bought 267 milligrams; in Phoenix, 244  
milligrams; in San Francisco, 195 milligrams; in Miami and Chicago, 
about 121 milligrams; and in Detroit and Washington, about 104 
milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
	A casual user might use 5 to 10 milligrams, while a hard-core  
user might use up to 10 times that in a dose. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, in 1988, $100 only bought 29 milligrams in Atlanta  
and 77 milligrams in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation funded the research.

<HEADLINE> Brown &AMP; Williamson Seeks Safe Smoke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Two tobacco companies say they are working  
on new methods to remove a potentially carcinogenic compound from 
tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. is experimenting with a curing  
process developed by a small Richmond, Va., firm to remove some of 
the nitrosamines from tobacco. Nitrosamines, which are related to 
nicotine, cause cancer in laboratory animals. 
</P>
<P>
	R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co said it has also found a new way to  
cure tobacco that reduced nitrosamines but said its findings were 
limited to laboratory studies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is you have to do it in a way that makes the  
tobacco still acceptable to consumers,'' said Brown &AMP; Williamson 
spokesman Mark Smith. ``If nobody smokes them, then you haven't 
come up with a product that's less hazardous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies were careful not to make broad claims about  
finding a healthier tobacco for cigarettes. Even without 
nitrosamines, cigarettes contain multiple agents that have been 
found to cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agree with the scientific community that more research has  
to be conducted and we believe it would be irresponsible to claim, 
or imply, that cigarettes with low nitrosamines are somehow 
safer,'' said Gary Burger, senior vice president for research and 
development at Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
	But an anti-smoking activist said the message the companies want  
to convey is clear. Dr. Jim Roach, a Midway, Ky., physician, said 
the effort to improve cigarettes is laudable, but suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are at least 34 cancer-causing agents in cigarettes,''  
Roach said. ``Removing one will help and I'm glad they're doing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ulterior motive (of the manufacturer) is to say cigarettes  
are safer and you don't have to stop. That's the message that we've 
got to be careful does not get transmitted,'' Roach said. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies are working to make sure the removal of a compound  
doesn't alter the taste that appeals to smokers. Harold Burton, a 
University of Kentucky chemist who has been assisting Star 
Scientific, the Richmond company working with Brown and Williamson, 
said taste remains a stumbling block. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, a longtime tobacco researcher, said the change may  
require a change in the ``definition of quality'' for tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said it is not B&AMP;W's first attempt to create a safer  
cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something we've been trying to do for 40 years,'' Smith  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company bought 100,000 pounds of flue-cured tobacco last  
year that was cured with the new process. It hopes to buy 1.2 
million pounds this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul L. Perito, a spokesman for Star Scientific, which began as  
a small manufacturer of discount cigarettes, said it will use the 
improved tobacco in its products and license the process to other 
cigarette manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star Scientific process involves two steps, one performed by  
the farmer during barn curing and another by a processor that 
includes microwaving the cured leaf. Reynolds said it is working on 
a new way to provide heating to flue-cure tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton said flue-cured tobacco is easier to manipulate during  
curing because it is done mechanically. Burley tobacco, which is 
generally considered of higher quality, is cured by simply hanging 
it in barns for weeks on end and Reynolds made no claim that its 
process would work for burley. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco farmers, already wracked by upheavals in their sales  
markets by tobacco company settlements of health claims, would end 
up having to pay more to use the Star Scientific curing process, 
Burton said. But they could also expect a premium price. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economics will have to be sorted out,'' Burton said.  
</P>
<P>
	Roy Burry, a tobacco industry analyst with Brown Brothers  
Harriman, said cigarette manufacturers can use any edge they can 
get. A company that succeeded in removing nitrosamines without 
repelling consumers would likely get some boost. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to be a pretty small thing. But why not?'' Burry  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds is the second-largest cigarette in the United States,  
has brands including Winston, Camel and Salem. B&AMP;W is No. 3 in the 
nation, with brands such as Kool, Lucky Strike and Viceroy.

<HEADLINE> Coyotes in Position to Top Blues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Shane Doan's apprenticeship is nearly done, which  
could mean good luck for the Phoenix Coyotes as they try to break 
their first-round playoff jinx. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old right wing, forced into a key role because of  
injuries to other Phoenix forwards, is a major reason the Coyotes 
are in position to finish off the St. Louis Blues at home Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes, down 0-1 and in jeopardy of another postseason  
skid, got new life when Doan scored the winning goal in overtime of 
Game 2. They took the next game when Doan's empty-net goal again 
wound up the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	A 2-1 victory Tuesday night gave Phoenix its 3-1 lead and the  
second three-game winning streak in its playoff history. 
</P>
<P>
	But Doan, who had only one playoff goal in three previous  
postseasons, wants someone else to be the hero. His reaction to 
tapping in a pass from Dallas Drake in the second game and scoring 
on a bank shot off the boards with 51 seconds left in the third is 
a soft laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got pretty lucky on both of them,'' Doan said. ``One was  
from an inch away and the other was 175 feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Keith Tkachuk taught him something about urgency by  
throwing his body across Al MacInnis' line of fire while the 
Coyotes were trying to protect their lead Tuesday. MacInnis has the 
hardest slap shot in the NHL and broke Juha Ylonen's foot with one 
in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``That game proved how badly he wants to win and how he's  
willing to do anything to win,'' Doan said about Tkachuk. ``As a 
young player, when you see your captain and your franchise player 
doing that, you know you've got to do whatever it takes to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nikolai Khabibulin had 27 saves in the Coyotes' best game of the  
series, 
</P>
<P>
	one that gave Rick Tocchet a feeling this could be the team to  
end the Coyotes' 12-year history of failing to reach the second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as we were happy about winning two games in St. Louis,  
I'd say 15 minutes after the game everybody was businesslike,'' 
Tocchet said. ``On the bus, there was no music playing, no partying 
going on. Guys were back to earth. It was just a quiet atmosphere. 
As a veteran player, I love seeing that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe in years past the team would have celebrated and really  
walked with a swagger like we're big, but I don't see it this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues are in the playoffs for the 20th consecutive year, and  
their locker room after practice Thursday also was calm and upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure is on the Coyotes to prove they know how to close a  
series, defenseman Chris Pronger said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to stay positive and stay in front of (goalie) Grant  
Fuhr and keep throwing pucks at their net,'' he said. ``I think we 
probably could crash the net a little harder and get some more 
traffic in front of the goalie, but for the most part we want to 
keep playing the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MacInnis has two goals and six assists, but he was shut out in  
Game 4, along with the Blues' productive power play, which is still 
scoring 33.3 percent of the time (6-of-18). 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we just played good enough to be close,'' Geoff  
Courtnall said about the Blues' last effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Courtnall was with Vancouver in 1994, when the Canucks were down  
3-1 to Calgary in the first round and came back to win. They also 
fought back from a 3-1 deficit against the New York Rangers in the 
finals before losing the last game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a lot of hard work,'' Courtnall said. ``You've just  
got to take it one period at a time, I think, and work hard and get 
some ugly goals -- you know, get some rebound goals and get hungry 
around the net.''
