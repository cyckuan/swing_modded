<HEADLINE> Cubs Put Hill on Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Chicago Cubs placed outfielder Glenallen  
Hill on the 15-day disabled list Sunday with a strained right 
hamstring and called up Bo Porter from Triple-A Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill became the ninth Cub to go on the disabled list this  
season. Pitchers Kevin Tapani, Terry Adams and Jon Lieber recently 
came off the disabled list, and Matt Karchner, Jeremi Gonzalez, 
Kurt Miller, Robin Jennings and Kerry Wood remain on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill hit .452 with five homers and 15 RBIs in 15 games before  
aggravating the hamstring last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter got his first call-up to the major leagues after hitting  
.280 with five homers in 25 games for Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Tapani, who had been disabled by tightness in his shoulder, made  
his second start since coming off the disabled list on Friday and 
was hit on the left wrist by Eddie Taubensee's line drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Tapani remained in the game, but X-rays on Saturday found he had  
broken the hamate bone by the outside of the wrist. Since it's his 
glove hand, he'll be able to keep pitching while the bone heals.

<HEADLINE> Aid for Hurricane Victims Stranded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Six months after Hurricane Mitch tore through  
Central America, tons of donated relief supplies are still stranded 
in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two warehouses are stuffed with clothes, food, bottled  
water and medical supplies stacked on pallets and ready to be sent 
to Honduras and Nicaragua. Some medicine is now outdated and must 
be thrown away. 
</P>
<P>
	In the rush to gather goods to help the hurricane's victims in  
Central America, insurmountable transportation problems emerged, 
relief groups say. 
</P>
<P>
	One group had to delay shipments for several months to a key  
Honduran port inundated with thousands of shipping containers full 
of relief supplies. Another group's shipments were stalled when the 
promise of a boat to transport the goods to Nicaragua fell through. 
</P>
<P>
	For people involved in the relief efforts, the wait has been  
frustrating. Dr. Mayer Heiman's voice broke as he stood in a 
warehouse near boxes of canned food and bottled baby food and said 
his group had reports of children starving in a remote part of 
Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would send all this down tomorrow if we could,'' said  
Heiman, president of the International Hospital for Children in New 
Orleans and a chief organizer of its relief effort. ``We've been 
waiting months to get all of this out of here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital received tons of donations by late December. Dole  
Fresh Fruit and Chiquita Brands International were shipping 
containers to Honduras for free. But organizers had to halt 
shipments in January when Honduran officials stopped accepting 
containers sent to the country's major port, Puerto Cortez. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after the port reopened, organizers were reluctant to  
resume shipments to Honduras. In the interim, they'd learned 
supplies were most sorely needed in some of Central America's 
remotest spots, and the hurricane had destroyed roads, sending 
trucking costs skyhigh. They had no assurances the donations would 
get through. 
</P>
<P>
	Heiman said his group's members wanted to send food, medicine  
and hospital supplies to the Miskito Indians who live in a swampy 
and impoverished area accessible only by boat. But they couldn't 
find a boat that could carry large amounts while navigating the 
shallow water. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting things shipped to where we want them has been the  
problem,'' Heiman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments resumed in April, and Heiman said his group will use a  
Roman Catholic church boat to send food, medicine and seeds for 
planting crops to the Miskitos. But the hospital's warehouse 
probably won't be emptied until June. 
</P>
<P>
	Another New Orleans group, the Nicaraguan Independent Committee  
for Assistance, arranged free shipment of relief supplies to 
Nicaragua in December on a cargo ship. The ship's owner planned to 
pay for the trip by bringing cargo from Nicaragua back to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	But the offer was rescinded when no goods materialized for the  
return trip, said Dr. Christian Mayorga, chairman of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	When Puerto Cortez got jammed up, blocking efforts to get  
supplies overland from Honduras to Nicaragua, some of the group's 
supplies were sent to Nicaragua on Louisiana National Guard planes, 
but much more languished in two warehouses. In April, thieves were 
arrested after they broke into one of the warehouses and stole 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayorga's group is now sending two 40-foot containers a week to  
Honduras, each carrying 60,000 pounds of supplies. From Honduras, 
the goods are trucked to Nicaragua. All of the group's donations 
should be in the country by June. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our people are still in great need, and we are going to  
continue this task,'' Mayorga said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the lesson is that logistical problems can overwhelm  
humanitarian efforts. It was easy to gather the donations, mostly 
from Louisiana residents, because New Orleans has a large 
population of people with Central American roots. But getting the 
goods to Central America rapidly proved difficult, then virtually 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the circumstances were very adverse,'' Mayorga  
said. ``We did not know how big this enterprise was going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another solution to send supplies directly to remote coastal  
areas of Honduras should be ready in a few days. Sub Ocean Safety, 
a nonprofit group, is refurbishing a World War II beach landing 
craft for regular trips and expects to make its maiden voyage to 
Honduras on May 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Sub Ocean Safety plans to take 100 tons of food, construction  
materials and hand tools to hard-hit parts of the country, said 
Robert Izdepski, the group's president. 
</P>
<P>
	The landing craft -- large enough to hold three military tanks --  
will shuttle supplies along the Honduran coast for other relief 
groups before returning to New Orleans to pick up more donated 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still a lot of stuff here and there's still a lot of  
need,'' Izdepski said.

<HEADLINE> How IRS' Tax Return Pipeline Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Each of the 10 IRS Service Centers operates what is called ``The  
Pipeline'' to process the tens of millions of paper tax returns 
mailed each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's how it works:  
</P>
<P>
	-- During peak filing season, thousands of tax returns are  
trucked to the service center every day. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mail is opened manually and sorted by type of return into  
slots at wooden ``Tingle'' tables, named for an employee who 
invented them. Checks are immediately set aside and deposited that 
day in a federal reserve bank. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Returns are hand-stamped with a 13-number code.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Employees examine returns for common errors, circling key  
information by hand and checking that all taxpayer information is 
included. Returns that appear questionable go into the ``funny 
box'' for further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Data from each return is entered by hand, processed by a local  
mainframe computer and then sent to the tape Master File located in 
Martinsburg, W.Va.

<HEADLINE> Actress Plato Dies of Overdose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOORE, Okla. (AP) -- Like her young ``Diff'rent Strokes''  
co-stars, Dana Plato had seen her share of troubles since the show 
was canceled. They finally ended not with the happiness she sought, 
but with the fatal drug overdose she feared. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato, 34, died Saturday after apparently taking the  
painkiller Loritab along with Valium while visiting the home of her 
fiance's parents. 
</P>
<P>
	She played Kimberly Drummond on the NBC sitcom that ran from  
1978 to 1984. Like co-stars Todd Bridges and Gary Coleman, she 
couldn't sustain the stardom the show brought her. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal problems began in 1991, when she was arrested for robbing  
a Las Vegas video store and was placed on five years' probation. In 
1992 she was given another five years' probation for forging 
prescriptions for Valium. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I hadn't gotten caught, it could have been the worst thing  
that happened to me because I could have died of a drug overdose,'' 
she said then. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Sgt. Scott Singer said Sunday that Ms. Plato's death  
``appears to be an accidental overdose. We don't suspect suicide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato and her fiance, Robert Menchaca, 28, had stopped at  
his parents' home in Moore for Mother's Day. They were en route to 
Los Angeles from New York, where she had appeared on Howard Stern's 
radio program to help revive her career and deny the claims of a 
former roommate who said Ms. Plato was on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato said she had been sober for about 10 years, though she  
had taken painkillers when her wisdom teeth were removed four 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer said Ms. Plato went to take a nap Saturday afternoon.  
Menchaca realized that evening that something was wrong, and his 
mother, a nurse, and brother tried unsuccessfully to revive her. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer says toxicology results aren't expected for about six  
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato's recent career had included mainly low-budget films  
such as 1992's ``Bikini Beach Race'' and the 1997 film ``Different 
Strokes: A Story of Jack and Jill ... and Jill,'' a direct-to-video 
softcore tale about a sexual threesome. 
</P>
<P>
	Her ``Diff'rent Strokes'' co-star Bridges, who played Willis,  
has been arrested several times. In 1990, he was acquitted of 
assault with a deadly weapon in the near-fatal shooting of a 
narcotics dealer in a Los Angeles drug den. 
</P>
<P>
	He once testified that he became depressed and turned to drugs  
after ``Diff'rent Strokes'' was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, who played the lovable Arnold, pleaded no contest in  
February to disturbing the peace for punching an autograph-seeker 
in the eye. He was ordered to attend anger management classes, 
fined and given a suspended jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato has a 14-year-old son, Tyler Lambert of Tulsa, from a  
previous marriage.

<HEADLINE> Olerud On-Base Streak Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- John Olerud's streak of reaching base safely in  
consecutive games ended at 47 today when he struck out as a pinch 
hitter for the final out of the New York Mets' 11-6 loss to the 
Arizona Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Olerud was the only pinch-hit option left in the  
dugout for the Mets, who carry 12 pitchers and 13 position players 
on their roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one of those things that had to end sooner or  
later,'' he said. ``I'll just try to get another streak started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olerud had reached base either with a hit or a walk in the last  
17 games of last year and the first 30 this years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not anything I paid a whole lot of attention to,'' he  
said. ``Every time you go to the plate, you just try to put 
pressure on the pitcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olerud's streak ended three games short of the Mets'  
single-season record of 33 set by Darryl Strawberry in 1987.

<HEADLINE> Gordon May Be Activated by Red Sox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Red Sox closer Tom Gordon, on the disabled  
list since April 18 because of a strained right elbow, might be 
ready to return. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking it day by day, but he could possibly be back  
tomorrow,'' Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said after Sunday's 6-1 
win over Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Infielder Donnie Sadler was optioned to Pawtucket after Sunday's  
game, a move that seemed to indicate that the Red Sox were prepared 
to activate Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon was trying to extend his major league record of 46  
straight saves on April 17 against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays when he 
left the game after throwing five pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good. I think I need to face some hitters and get back  
in the game,'' Gordon said. ``Right now, I'm a little lacking in 
arm strength, but that comes with pitching. I'm ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox bullpen has struggled in Gordon's absence, blowing  
seven save chances this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams gave Tim Wakefield a shot on Thursday night and he  
responded, saving a 3-2 victory over Texas. Wakefield got his 
second save Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did it more for the club's sake,'' he said. ``Whatever it  
takes to help the team win. It turned out I was needed out there.''

<HEADLINE> Flavored Smokes Appeal to Teens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The smoke wafting through some of the nation's  
hippest teen hangouts doesn't always smell like Marlboros or Camels 
anymore. And, although the cigarettes are thin and hand-rolled, it 
doesn't smell like marijuana either. 
</P>
<P>
	This scent is sweeter, exhalations of strawberries, chocolate  
and vanilla. 
</P>
<P>
	From Atlanta's Little Five Points to New York's East Village to  
San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury, hippie wannabes are lighting up 
bidis -- flavored cigarettes imported from India. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're dessert with a cigarette,'' says Leah Parrish, 19,  
standing outside a tobacco store in Little Five Points. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidis -- sometimes called beedies and about half the size of  
regular cigarettes -- are filled with tobacco flakes, hand-rolled 
with a greenish-brown leaf, tapered at both ends and tied with a 
tiny, colored thread. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidis cost less than regular cigarettes, averaging $2 for a pack  
of 20. 
</P>
<P>
	And they're drawing youngsters to smoking even better than Joe  
Camel, some health officials say. Teens say they're cute, trendy, 
less bitter and more natural than domestic smokes. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey last year found that 58 percent of students at four San  
Francisco high schools had tried bidis. 
</P>
<P>
	Sold in specialty tobacco and cigarette stores for several  
years, bidis now are popping up in gas stations, convenience marts 
and grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Anna Falcone, tobacco buyer at Junkman's Daughter, a clothing  
and gift shop in Atlanta, said bidis are a top seller, outpaced 
only by clove cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a little bit more exotic,'' she says. ``They're  
smoking a little brown cigarette that smells like strawberry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal health officials and anti-smoking activists say many  
youngsters don't realize that unfiltered bidis are even more 
dangerous than regular cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite containing less tobacco than a U.S. cigarette, an  
unfiltered bidi ``releases at least two to three times more tar and 
nicotine,'' says Samira Asma, an epidemiologist with the 
Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidis have been made for centuries in India, where they are  
known as the ``poor man's cigarette.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Darryl Jayson, spokesman for the Tobacco Merchants Association,  
an industry trade group, said it's difficult to determine how many 
bidis are imported because they are counted under different tariff 
codes. 
</P>
<P>
	And even with the growing popularity of bidis, all imported  
cigarettes make up less than 1 percent of the U.S. tobacco market, 
according to the Specialty Tobacco Counsel, based in North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Three major importers, Kretek International of California,  
Quintin USA Inc. of Colorado and Smokers Choice of California, who 
also sell bidis on the Internet, refused to comment on their sales. 
</P>
<P>
	According to stores, the most popular flavors are vanilla, black  
licorice, strawberry, dewberry, clove and cinnamon. The different 
flavors are a pleasant change from the regular fare, smokers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like picking up a Marlboro,'' Ms. Falcone says.  
</P>
<P>
	Ashley Woodall, a 22-year-old Atlanta restaurant employee, says  
strawberry bidis are her favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Bree Strahan, a high school senior in suburban Atlanta, says she  
like bidis, but they're not strong enough for her. And it's 
sometimes tough to keep them lit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could never smoke them instead of a regular cigarette,'' she  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The popularity of bidis doesn't surprise anti-smoking activists,  
who say the Indian cigarettes should be more closely regulated and 
should cost more to keep them out of the hands of teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission is investigating reports that many  
bidis are sold without the required warning labels. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're horrible,'' says Ron Todd, director of tobacco control  
for the American Cancer Society. ``It's just unfortunate that 
they're finding their way in the hands of children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's just another gimmick, says John F. Banzhaf III, executive  
director of Action on Smoking and Health, a Washington-based 
anti-smoking group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's looking for some way to make a new cigarette and  
get a niche market,'' he said. ``They'll put chocolate in it, 
they'll put vanilla in it.''

<HEADLINE> Stars, Blues Set for Game 3 / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Blues are back in familiar  
playoff territory, trying to climb out of a hole. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues rallied from a 3-1 series deficit to beat the Phoenix  
Coyotes in the first round, and they now find themselves down 2-0 
to the Dallas Stars. The second-round challenge appears tougher, 
since the Stars were No. 1 overall in the NHL in the regular season 
and enter Game 3 Monday night with a six-game playoff winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis can take solace from forcing the Stars to overtime  
Saturday night. The Blues led 2-1 and 3-2 before falling on Joe 
Nieuwendyk's second goal of the game, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going back home down 2-0, but we have to move on and  
think about the third game,'' Pierre Turgeon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Joel Quenneville felt his team deserved a lot better.  
</P>
<P>
	``We had the higher quality chances, and we didn't capitalize at  
the right moments,'' Quenneville said. ``Certainly we proved we've 
got a chance against these guys. It's not a hopeless situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock wasn't crowing after Saturday night's  
5-4 overtime victory, a game filled with odd-man rushes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope I never see another game like that again,''  
Hitchcock said. ``That was one revved-up hockey game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blues goalie Grant Fuhr was thinking the same thing after giving  
up five goals on 25 shots. He said he should have stopped 
Nieuwendyk's goal, a high wrist shot at 8:22 of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime we get four goals, we should win,'' Fuhr said. ``We  
can take a positive from that, but the bottom line is that if I 
play better we win some games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fuhr rebounded from his worst game in the first round. After  
giving up four goals in 12 shots in Game 3 against the Coyotes, he 
played well the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fuhrsy is a competitive guy, and he knows his game pretty  
well,'' Quenneville said. ``He'll bounce back from something like 
that. He'll be the guy when it counts, that's for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nieuwendyk is savoring the playoff experience after missing all  
but one game last year with a knee injury. He had two goals and an 
assist in Game 2, along with other excellent chances, and is among 
the NHL leaders with five goals and two assists in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it chewed him up inside that he wasn't a part of the  
playoff run last year,'' Hitchcock said. ``He's making the most of 
it this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nieuwendyk's play made up for a dull night for the Stars' top  
line of Mike Modano, Brett Hull and Jere Lehtinen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things haven't panned out the way we wanted the last couple of  
games,'' said Modano, who played nearly 24 minutes Saturday without 
a shot. ``But we can't get tied up in a numbers situation -- 
everybody else will do that for us -- instead of playing good, smart 
hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turgeon had a strong game although he had been a doubtful  
starter after getting slashed on the back of the left knee by Pat 
Verbeek in Game 1. Verbeek and the Blues' Jamal Mayers, who took a 
retaliatory slash at Darryl Sydor, willl return Monday after 
serving one-game suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues prodded Pavol Demitra, their leading scorer in the  
regular season, into productivity by putting him on the fourth line 
with enforcers Tony Twist and Tyson Nash. Demitra, who had been a 
team-worst minus-4 in the playoffs, had two goals. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis didn't practice Sunday after arriving home at about 3  
a.m., concluding a stretch where they were on the road 26 of 34 
days. Their flight was delayed when smoke filled the cabin before 
departure.

debut nearly six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Marquez hopes to fight WBO featherweight champion Naseem Hamed  
at some point in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas, 28, is 23-11 with 18 knockouts and has three failed  
attempts at winning WBO championships. 
</P>

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Former President George Bush was among several  
high-ranking government officials who helped Atlanta secure the 
1996 Olympics, according to records released by bid organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush videotaped a two-minute message that Atlanta organizers  
presented to the International Olympic Committee during its final 
bid presentation in September, 1990 in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush sent personal letters to each IOC member just before the  
final vote, according to documents in nine boxes of Olympic records 
released by the Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation. A bid team 
memo said Bush's message was ``very effective,'' The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta beat out Athens, Toronto and Birmingham, England, for  
the right to host the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The records show the Atlanta organizers also enlisted the help  
of the U.S. State Department, then-U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn and then-Vice 
President Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine boxes are a fraction of 4,000 boxes of Olympic  
documents kept by the athletics foundation, which Payne founded to 
spearhead Atlanta's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper and the foundation are locked in a legal battle  
over the release of the rest of the records. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper says it wants to see if the records contain  
evidence of corruption like that uncovered in Salt Lake City's 
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. House subcommittee investigating the Salt Lake scandal is  
already investigating the files, looking for the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletics foundation claims the documents are the property  
of a group of private citizens, and therefore are not governed by 
the state's Open Records Act. State Attorney General Thurbert Baker 
has declared they are open, prompting the foundation to file suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Roy Barnes has also said he believes the records should be  
open to the public, as the Games involved massive amounts of public 
funding for transportation and security.

<HEADLINE> Week Wasn't Grand for Maddux </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- On Tuesday, Greg Maddux allowed just the second  
grand slam of his career -- to Mark McGwire, no less. 
</P>
<P>
	By Sunday, his ERA was up to an un-Madduxlike 4.57.  
</P>
<P>
	After allowing 10 hits in six innings of Sunday's 5-0 loss to  
the San Diego Padres, the Atlanta Braves right-hander said he 
doesn't think he's pitching that badly. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's the kind of day he had: He allowed a three-run homer by  
John Vander Wal to center field, but kept his chief nemesis, 
eight-time batting champion Tony Gwynn, from hitting one out of the 
infield. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other guy (Sterling Hitchcock) threw a good game,'' said  
Maddux (4-2), who last year claimed his fourth NL ERA title with a 
2.22 mark. ``I'm upset about the homer I gave up. I didn't get hit 
hard with the exception of Vander Wal. (Jim) Leyritz hit a ball 
good up the middle and Reggie (Sanders) hit a ball good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vander Wal said the changeup he hit out in the sixth ``didn't  
have the life on it that he wanted, the sharp downward tilt that he 
normally gets with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just the luck of the draw that he left a pitch up and I  
got ahold of it,'' said Vander Wal, whose homer cleared the fence 
just to the right of straightaway center. ``I knew at least I had a 
sac fly, and I was fortunate enough it went out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quilvio Veras, struggling along at .169, hit a two-run single to  
break a scoreless tie in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was Gwynn, who turned 39 on Sunday but got no gifts  
from Maddux. Gwynn has more hits off Maddux -- 35 -- than he has off 
any other pitcher, but went 0-for-3 to see his career average 
against him dip from .455 to .438 (35-for-80). 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hitting .450 against him?'' Gwynn said. ``So I'm supposed  
to get a hit against him every time? Shoot, he's still hard to 
hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn said Maddux was locating his pitches where he wanted them.  
</P>
<P>
	``First time up he throws me four changeups. Next time he comes  
with a big sweeping curve, which he hardly ever throws. Then he 
busts me on the knuckles with a heater. You can't sit on anything. 
You're just trying to put the bat on the ball,'' Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never feel comfortable because he can do so many things,  
either with his movement or his location.''

<HEADLINE> Entertainment Heads To Meet Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton says Monday's summit on  
youth violence is about finding answers, not assigning blame. But 
participants from the entertainment industry will be feeling more 
pressure than anyone else on the guest list, particularly since the 
gun lobby says it wasn't invited. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado high school massacre last month has stirred debate  
over whether movies, music and video games have helped shape a 
culture of violence among young people. That and relatively easy 
access to guns have often been cited as possible factors in the 
Columbine High School rampage by two student gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	As leaders of Hollywood's major industry associations arrive in  
Washington, they will be met with growing calls for government 
intervention. Sen. Orrin Hatch, for instance, plans this week to 
propose a federal investigation into whether Hollywood is marketing 
violent products specifically to youths. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time has come for us as a nation to demand more  
accountability from everyone involved -- including the entertainment 
industry,'' Hatch, R-Utah, said last week in testimony before the 
Senate Commerce Committee's hearing on ``Marketing Violence to Our 
Children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A recent poll showed that parents are now more concerned about  
the violence their children see in movies or television than about 
the sex, a reversal from previous surveys. Significantly, that poll 
by the National Institute on Media and the Family was conducted 
before the Littleton, Colo., shooting on April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Movie studio lobbyist Jack Valenti, head of the organization  
that assigns ratings to films, said his message at the White House 
session will be that moral lessons start at the home, school and 
church. But he says he also supports a major federal study into 
violent behavior by children and possible media influences. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying that movies don't have an impact, I just don't  
know what it is,'' said Valenti, president of the Motion Picture 
Association of America. ``All I know is that other countries whose 
children watch the same movies and (TV) shows as we do here have 
crime rates that are much lower. There must be other factors that 
we don't know about going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Valenti, the entertainment industry will be  
represented by the heads of the Recording Industry Association of 
America, the National Association of Broadcasters, the National 
Cable Television Association and the Interactive Digital Software 
Association. Also expected is the chief executive of America 
Online. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also invited parents, youths, teachers, religious  
leaders, law enforcement people and gun manufacturers to Monday's 
meeting, which he described as a strategy session to ``seek out the 
best ideas'' for reducing youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not ask who takes the blame, but how we can all take  
responsibility,'' Clinton said last week. ``And I will challenge 
everyone there and everyone in America to do their part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But ``everyone there'' won't include the National Rifle  
Association, which issued a statement saying it was not invited to 
what it called an ``alleged 'summit' on violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA, which met with loud protests when it held a meeting in  
Denver after the Columbine school shootings, said that on Monday it 
would ``unveil substantial proposals which would have an immediate 
and significant impact on violent crime in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least one critic has complained that Clinton's response to  
the issue has been muted by the strong support he has received from 
the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``This administration is owned and operated, bought and paid  
for, by the Hollywood liberal establishment,'' said Andrea Sheldon, 
executive director of the church lobby the Traditional Values 
Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1996 election, Clinton received $442,000 from television  
and movie executives and their families, compared to $166,000 for 
Republican challenger Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Entertainment figures also generously donated to Clinton's legal  
defense fund during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Among those giving 
$10,000 were rock singer Don Henley, TV producer Paul Simms and 
former studio mogul Lew Wasserman. Actor Robert De Niro gave 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheldon contended that the media's portrayal of American culture  
``is a major culprit in what is wrong in many of our nation's 
schools.''

<HEADLINE> 'Wit' Wins Drama Desk Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Wit,'' which has already won the Pulitzer  
Prize, was named Sunday as outstanding new play of the 1998-99 
theater season by the Drama Desk. 
</P>
<P>
	The Drama Desk, made up of theater writers, named ``Parade,'' a  
musical which had a short run at Lincoln Center, as outstanding new 
musical, in ceremonies held Sunday at LaGuardia High School of 
Music and Art and Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	Other winners among the 28 categories were Brian Dennehy  
(``Death of a Salesman'') and Kathleen Chalfant (``Wit''), 
outstanding actor and actress, Brent Carver (``Parade'') and a tie, 
Carolee Carmello (``Parade'') and Bernadette Peters (``Annie Get 
Your Gun''), outstanding actor and actress in a musical. 
</P>
<P>
	Outstanding revival of a play also was a tie, ``Death of a  
Salesman'' and ``The Iceman Cometh.'' ``You're a Good Man, Charlie 
Brown'' was judged outstanding revival of a musical. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wit'' is about a literature professor who is dying of cancer.  
``Parade'' tells the true story of a Jewish man in Atlanta who was 
accused of murder and lynched early this century.

<HEADLINE> Webber, Kings Vow To Work Harder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Chris Webber spent two weeks resting his  
aching back -- for this? 
</P>
<P>
	The Sacramento Kings' star forward has been to the playoffs  
three times with three teams, but has yet to win a postseason game. 
He fell to 0-7 with the Kings' 117-87 thrashing courtesy of the 
Utah Jazz on Saturday, the worst playoff loss in the franchise's 
51-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Webber, Sacramento's leading scorer and rebounder, got into  
early foul trouble and wasn't a factor as the Jazz cruised to a 
23-point first-half lead. After missing five critical late-season 
games while resting a sprained joint in his back, Webber didn't 
enjoy getting crowned in his Kings postseason debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't even know how frustrating that was,'' Webber said.  
``I wanted to help us out more, but you can't make a difference 
when you're not on the court. I think I just have to work harder at 
every part of my game, and I have to play smarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So do his teammates. While the Jazz held a light workout at  
their West Valley City practice gym and went home early, the Kings 
sweated through more than three hours of practice and a fil, 
session Sunday at the Delta Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, we needed it,'' Webber said. ``This team isn't going to  
give up just because things went wrong in Game 1. There's still a 
lot of basketball left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 in the best-of-5 round is Monday night, and the series  
shifts to Arco Arena in Sacramento for Game 3 Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings swept into the postseason as one of the league's  
hottest teams, with 10 wins in their last 11 games. But the Jazz, 
playing in their 16th consecutive postseason, showed a poise and 
game-readiness that can only be learned through years of experience 
-- something Sacramento doesn't have. 
</P>
<P>
	``They showed us how to come out and be ready to play,''  
Sacramento coach Rick Adelman said. ``The playoffs are a totally 
different game, and we're a young team. We learned a lot 
(Saturday).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adelman broke down the Kings' loss on film and highlighted  
breakdowns on fast breaks, on defense and in their half-court 
offense -- ``Basically, everything,'' Webber laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always look worse on film, so it was even worse than the  
game, if you can imagine that,'' Jon Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Webber picked up two fouls less than six minutes into the first  
quarter. The Kings already were down 19-8, and with Webber on the 
bench, Karl Malone and the Jazz made a 10-4 run that essentially 
buried Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	Webber came back in the second quarter but missed three shots  
and was hit with his third foul. He didn't score until a minute 
remained in the half, and 10 of his 14 points came after Utah had 
an insurmountable second-half lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just have to take your punches and get back up,'' Webber  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a lockout-lengthened offseason of uncertainty during which  
he publicly aired his dismay over being traded from Washington to 
Sacramento, Webber had a stellar first season with the Kings. He 
won his first league rebounding title and led the Kings to the same 
number of wins (27) in a 50-game schedule as they managed during 
the 82-game 1997-98 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	But his playing time and effectiveness were curtailed late in  
the year by his back injury, and though he said he is more than 
healthy enough to play, ``at times, it definitely is a little 
stiff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Webber on the bench in foul trouble, the Kings had no  
answer for Malone, who scored 21 points in the game's first three 
quarters, and Utah's balanced attack. Six Jazz players finished in 
double figures, while Utah held Sacramento to 36.5 percent shooting 
and outrebounded the Kings 48-38. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Jerry Sloan wasn't entirely pleased.  
</P>
<P>
	``We still haven't played 48 minutes of defense this season,''  
the Jazz coach said. ``I was happy we came out intensely on 
offense, but we let them do a number of things on offense that 
could come back to haunt us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After posting his lowest scoring average in a decade during the  
regular season, Jeff Hornacek was back in the swing of things 
Saturday. He scored 18 points on 8-of-11 shooting and added seven 
assists, all against defensive specialist Tariq Abdul-Wahad. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize that that's just one game,'' Hornacek said. ``We  
don't ever think beyond the next game, but we also know from 
experience that you can't take too much from one bad performance.''

<HEADLINE> Gun Critics Target the TEC-9 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As two high school gunmen fired on their  
classmates in Littleton, Colo., Dennis Henigan was honing his 
arguments in a lawsuit against the maker of the pistol used in 
their assault. 
</P>
<P>
	His case is the latest in a spate of largely unsuccessful  
efforts to hold Miami-based Navegar responsible for killings 
committed with the TEC-9, a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	The TEC-9 is well known to authorities. Federal agents say it is  
more likely to be used in a crime than any other handgun although 
it's been banned by federal and state governments. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the TEC-9, and spinoffs like the TEC DC-9, have a poor  
reputation among gun sellers, police say drug dealers prefer them 
because they're cheap, can carry 36-bullet clips and, at 12.5 
inches, are easily concealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Henigan, a lawyer for the Washington, D.C.-based Center to  
Prevent Handgun Violence, sued on behalf of victims of a massacre 
at a San Francisco office building. 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1993, Gian Luigi Ferri, a mentally disturbed man with a  
grudge against lawyers, used a TEC DC-9 to kill eight people and 
wound six others in a law office, then killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the gun is so small, Ferri was able to tote his weapon  
and 250 rounds of ammunition in his briefcase undetected. Like 
other semiautomatics, TEC-9 style guns automatically reload a 
bullet into the chamber, allowing a gunman to fire as fast as he 
can pull the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
	``The TEC-9 a particular favorite among criminal offenders,''  
said James Alan Fox, dean of the College of Criminal Justice at 
Northeastern University in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The more violent the crime, the greater the chance a TEC-9 is  
used, Fox found in a study of 1991-1994 data, making the gun 
``especially a weapon of choice among violent offenders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gun, found under the brand name Intratec, is among the 10  
firearms that make it fastest from the original dealer to a crime, 
according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	Henigan says the problem isn't simply that criminals favor the  
TEC-9 -- it's that Navegar has gone out of its way to market the gun 
to criminals. Ads called the TEC-9 ``tough as your toughest 
customer,'' and said it has a finish with ``excellent resistance to 
fingerprints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whenever the gun has been banned, Navegar made modest changes to  
the TEC-9, renamed it and then produced a legal version. 
</P>
<P>
	After the District of Columbia banned the gun by name in 1991,  
Navegar eliminated threads on the barrel that could accommodate a 
silencer and changed the name to TEC DC-9. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very clear that this company has made a determined effort  
to try to evade statutes designed to restrict the sale of its 
assault weapons,'' Henigan said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the TEC-9 and DC-9 were listed in the 1994 federal assault  
weapons ban, Navegar came out with the AB-10. Critics say the 
letters stand for ``after ban.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's essentially no functional difference to them,'' said  
Bob Glass, a gun shop owner and publisher of libertarian magazine 
``The Partisan,'' based in Longmont, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached at his Coral Gables, Fla., home, Navegar owner Carlos  
Garcia declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Although assault bans have outlawed manufacture of the gun, they  
do not ban the sale of pre-ban guns. That's the reason there are an 
estimated 100,000 TEC-9, TEC DC-9 and AB-10 handguns in American 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	One appealing aspect to the TEC-9 series is its price -- cheap.  
</P>
<P>
	A banned Uzi pistol costs about $1,400, and Heckler and Koch  
makes a banned SP-89 that costs $3,000. A post-ban semiautomatic 
made by Professional Ordinance retails for more than $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
	But the post-ban AB-10 sells at retail gun shops for $225 to  
$275. Federal and state bans have driven up the price of pre-ban 
TEC-9 guns to only about $350. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, gun dealers say TEC-9 guns are inaccurate and prone to  
jam. Investigators in Littleton say the large number of unused 
bullets at the scene suggests the TEC DC-9 used by Dylan Klebold 
may have jammed. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wouldn't see any professional criminals using it, people  
who know what they're doing,'' Glass said. ``If you're going to rob 
a bank you want your gun to work. If you're a 15-year-old crackhead 
who wants to steal a car, that's different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the last five years, Navegar has been sued in at least four  
cases in Florida, one in Arizona, two in Illinois and one in 
Louisiana. Those cases are pending. 
</P>
<P>
	For those like Henigan who seek to hold Navegar responsible for  
the deeds done with its weapons, it's an uphill struggle. Henigan's 
case has already been thrown out of court once and is now scheduled 
to be heard on appeal in June.

<HEADLINE> Baffert's Plans Call for 2 Fillies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Trainer Bob Baffert's latest lineup for  
Saturday's $1 million Preakness now includes star fillies 
Silverbulletday and Excellent Meeting and excludes Prime Timber. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert says Prime Timber, fourth in the Kentucky Derby, is  
definitely out of the Preakness and will run instead in the Sir 
Barton Stakes on Saturday's undercard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, the plan is to run both fillies in the Preakness,''  
Baffert said Saturday, before he sent out Real Quiet -- last year's 
Derby-Preakness winner -- to victory in the Pimlico Special. ``Both 
fillies will be entered in the Black-Eyed Susan (on Friday) and the 
Preakness in case the draw for the Preakness is unfavorable. I'm 
leaving my options open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three horses were scheduled for workouts either Monday or  
Tuesday at Churchill Downs before shipping to Pimlico on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, a winner in 10 of 11 career starts, has never  
run against males. In her last race, she won the Kentucky Oaks on 
April 30 at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting tested males for the first time in the Derby,  
finishing a strong fifth -- just over 2 1/2 lengths behind the winner 
Charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	``They deserve a chance,'' Baffert said of his fillies.  
``Excellent Meeting showed it in the Derby. She had probably the 
worst trip of any horse in the race. She could have easily won. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silverbulletday had a very easy race in the Kentucky Oaks. You  
hate to run them against each other, but it's going to be a great 
race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If both run, it would mark the first time since 1921 that more  
than one filly has run in the Preakness. Four fillies have won, but 
none since Nellie Morse in 1924. Rhine Maiden won in 1915, 
Whimsical in 1906 and Flocarline in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Prime Timber, Baffert said: ``If I'm going to the Belmont  
with him, I can't just sit on him. He has to run to get ready to go 
a mile and a half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Belmont Stakes is June 5.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DERBY WINNER DOING FINE:* Charismatic, the surprise Derby  
winner at odds of 31-1, and third-place finisher Cat Thief, 
galloped Sunday at Churchill Downs and will have their final 
workouts on Tuesday before shipping to Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're doing great,'' said Mark Maker, trainer D. Wayne  
Lukas' assistant. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PREAKNESS PRATTLE:* K One King, eighth in the Derby, is out of  
the Preakness with a small chip on his left front ankle. ... Badge, 
winner of the Gotham Stakes, was scheduled for a final workout 
Monday at Belmont Park before trainer Joe Aquilino decides whether 
to ship his colt to Pimlico. ... Kimberlite Pipe, sixth in the 
Derby, will be ridden by Shane Sellers in the Preakness. Sellers 
rode Vicar to an 18th-place finish in the Derby. ... Trainer Nick 
Zito says Adonis and Stephen Got Even will have their final 
Preakness workouts on Tuesday at Pimlico. ... Derby runner-up 
Menifee was scheduled to work Monday at Churchill Downs before 
Wednesday's trip to Baltimore. ``Everything is good so far,'' 
trainer Elliott Walden said. ... If Valhol is unable to run in the 
Preakness due to insufficient earnings, trainer Dallas Keen says 
the gelding will start in the Sir Barton Stakes. ... Vicar, 18th in 
the Derby, was scheduled to work Tuesday at Churchill Downs before 
trainer Carl Nafzger makes a final decision on whether to run him 
in the Preakness.

<HEADLINE> Investors Cheered by Asian Recovery / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Signs of better times for battered Asian  
economies have played a decisive role in the behavior of U.S. stock 
prices this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Asia is looking healthier, investors have grown much  
more enthusiastic about prospects for U.S. companies whose fortunes 
are closely tied to the ups and downs of the business cycle in this 
country and worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, those investors have been willing to shift some  
money out of traditional growth stocks and into cyclical 
manufacturing and commodity companies whose shares have languished 
for many months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asia is now on the mend,'' says Stephen Roach, global  
economist at Wall Street's Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. ``As 
Asia turns, the global economy can only benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the pre-crisis years of 1996 and 1997, non-Japan Asia added  
as much as 1.5 percentage points to world gross domestic product 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to our estimates, in 1998 Asia dragged global growth  
down by about half a percentage point -- a negative swing of about 2 
percentage points. Courtesy of Asian healing, that swing is now 
about to reverse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impact of these changing expectations has been most directly  
apparent in Asian markets themselves. Through the first four months 
of 1999, mutual funds that invest in Pacific countries have chalked 
up some of the best gains among all fund categories. 
</P>
<P>
	The various Lipper Inc. averages of Pacific funds rose by  
between 19 percent and 24 percent over that span, recouping a big 
chunk of the losses they suffered in the past couple of years. From 
last fall's market lows in early October, they sport gains of 43 
percent to 52 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a more roundabout effect, depressed categories of U.S.  
have fared almost as well as fears of a worldwide financial crisis 
have eased. 
</P>
<P>
	From the end of a vicious selloff in early October through April  
30, Lipper's average of U.S. small-capitalization stock funds 
climbed 41.55 percent, actually outperforming the Standard &AMP; Poor's 
500-stock composite index funds, which gained 40.34 percent through 
that same period. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock markets tend to move on anticipation of future trends, not  
current news. Richard Rippe, director of the economics research 
group at Prudential Securities, says world economic activity is 
still expected to be sluggish for a while yet. 
</P>
<P>
	But he adds, ``the fundamental case for acceleration in 2000 is  
a good one. For most of Asia, 1998 was a disastrous year. Asian 
economies will stabilize in 1999, then turn stronger in 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the shocks of the recent past, of course, most analysts  
look to Asia with plenty of lingering caution. As Rippe puts it, 
``The experience of the last few years is bound to evoke concerns 
about where the next currency and-or financial crisis could erupt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the biggest risk in this outlook is the situation in  
Japan. If Japan's output continues to fall, it will be a problem -- 
Japan is the second largest economy in the world, and continued 
declines there would jeopardize Asia's reaching sustainable growth 
as well as the preservation of financial stability in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, if Asia does recover strongly and worldwide  
business activity accelerates, analysts say the chances would 
increase of a more restrictive Federal Reserve credit policy, and 
higher interest rates, in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	But for now at least, the main message for the stock market has  
been positive. ``The future now looks very different from the 
recent past in once critical respect,'' says Roach. ``Asia should 
no longer be viewed as a serious risk to the global economy or 
world financial markets.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Plans Virtual Clinic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- James Pittman woke one morning with a  
strong squeezing sensation in his chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspecting the worst, the 42-year-old Microsoft programmer  
wasted no time driving 10 miles to his doctor's office only to be 
told -- after ``a 2-second diagnosis'' -- he had pulled a back 
muscle, probably while painting his home the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what a heart attack feels like,'' he said. ``And  
I completely forgot that I was painting the house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next time Pittman feels the urge to see the doctor, he may have  
another option. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of driving across town on a workday, he could log on to  
his computer, make sure the small camera atop the monitor is 
correctly angled, then point and click to a Web site for 
``virtual'' treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to the ``virtual clinic'' -- futuristic employee health  
care that may soon be available to 13,800 Microsoft workers at 
company headquarters here, and 16,000 others around the country and 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may be another piece of the puzzle to economically extend  
health care to people wherever they are,'' said Dr. Bill Crounse of 
Overlake Hospital in nearby Bellevue, who is working with 
Microsoft's benefits group to make the virtual clinic a reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``The employees are just wild for this.''  
</P>
<P>
	But they may have to wait a while. The concept is so new the  
American Medical Association has never heard of it. Even Microsoft 
has no idea when it will become a reality, spokesman Dan Leach 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone thinks it's a great idea.  
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Court, director of Consumers for Quality Care, a Santa  
Monica, Calif.-based advocacy group, said practicing medicine via 
computer to cut costs is a slippery slope that could lead to poor 
patient care and litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality is you don't know what a patient needs until you  
see the patient,'' Court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some medical centers already have the capacity for face-to-face  
two-way conferencing -- often called telemedicine -- to provide 
consultation services and collegial help to doctors, usually in 
rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	But new and cheaper computer technologies are rapidly bringing  
that capacity into people's homes and offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Crounse believes the virtual clinic will function in the  
workplace within the year, and will be available in some homes 
within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't do it, someone else will,'' he said in an  
interview. ``It's the missing link in health care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Microsoft is ``a natural partner'' for the pioneering  
effort, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only are its employees more computer savvy than most and  
more likely to have the required hardware, software and bandwidth, 
but many are what Crounse calls ``the worried well'' -- prone to 
visit doctors for colds and flus, sprains and strains. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft workers already have access to a watered-down version  
of the virtual clinic from their desktops. Crounse receives a 
steady stream of e-mails -- five or 10 a week -- from employees who 
click on an ``Ask the doctor'' link on the benefits Web site on the 
company intranet. 
</P>
<P>
	He handles most of the queries himself, referring about 15  
percent to any of 55 specialists in his e-mail bank and others to 
helpful Internet sites -- all at no cost to employees. Leach 
declined to disclose any costs to Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers tap the e-mail link for advice on whether a whiplash  
victim should seek help first from a chiropractor or a physical 
therapist, if it's safe for a mother to give a small dose of adult 
cold-sore medication to her 4-year-old and the like. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's only a taste of things to come, Crounse told a group  
of employees on the Microsoft campus recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Using Microsoft's NETMeeting software, Crounse demonstrated how  
a doctor and patient in a virtual clinic could see, hear and talk 
to each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor could call up computer images -- an anatomical drawing  
of a back, perhaps -- and have the patient indicate exactly where it 
hurts. He could fill out an electronic prescription, e-mail it to 
an online drugstore that offers home delivery and e-mail the 
patient home-care instructions and details of his or her next 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	A virtual visit would include everything but the physical  
prodding and poking of a real-world visit to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Crounse, vice president and chief information officer at  
Overlake, does not advocate doing away with the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to make a diagnosis or provide patient care''  
at the virtual clinic, he said. ``It's more informational, pointing 
people in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between 20 percent and 30 percent of doctor visits are  
unnecessary, and just as readily dealt with from the desktop, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A virtual visit, like a phone call, would help doctors screen  
out needless actual visits -- and, says Crounse, potentially save 
employers money. 
</P>
<P>
	By one estimate, Americans make an average of five visits a year  
to the doctor, taking between one-third to one-half a day off work 
each time. 
</P>
<P>
	A '90s trend of insistence on greater access to health  
information bodes well for the virtual clinic idea, says Greg 
Vigdor, senior vice president of the Washington State Hospital 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there would probably be strict protocols on how it would  
work,'' to prevent lawsuits arising from incorrect assessments of 
patient needs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's just one of several hurdles the idea faces.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are huge issues in terms of patient, physician and  
(insurance) payer acceptance,'' Counse said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least some of the issues stem from the hybrid nature of the  
idea. 
</P>
<P>
	How, for example, should doctors bill patients for visits that  
are not quite face-to-face meetings, which doctors typically charge 
for, but more than telephone calls, which most do not? 
</P>
<P>
	Crounse says visits to the virtual clinic wouldn't be free -- the  
demands on doctors' time would be the same as in face-to-face 
consultations, and start-up and other computer costs would exceed 
those of owning a telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's confident it would be cheaper than a real-world doctor  
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	And, if some doctors eventually operate exclusively on a virtual  
basis -- in partnership with real-world doctors -- it could be 
cheaper still, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even those most familiar with the virtual-clinic concept said  
they could not guess at the costs. It's too soon, Leach said -- 
though he expects Microsoft employees may have to kick in for a 
full-fledged virtual clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	The concept could work, said spokeswoman Barbara Stenson in the  
office of state Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn, ``if people 
like it and if doctors like it, and carriers and companies feel 
it's cost effective'' -- which she predicted they would. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might act as a screener'' to reduce insurance claims and  
thus cut costs -- savings that could be passed on to consumers in 
the form of lower premiums, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Crounse and team don't need all the answers. Getting a  
prototype off the ground is their prime concern. Insurance issues 
have yet to arise -- Microsoft is self-insured, so its health 
insurance programs are not regulated by the commissioner's office.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Differed in Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley might seem like two  
peas in a pod -- free-trading Democrats both wonkish and wooden. 
Just don't get them started on daylight savings time and highway 
billboards. 
</P>
<P>
	Now competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in  
2000, Gore and Bradley were colleagues in the Senate. As members of 
the same party, the junior senator from Tennessee and senior 
senator from New Jersey voted alike on more than three-quarters of 
all roll-call votes, according to an Associated Press analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	But compared side by side, their voting records reveal some  
fundamental differences on issues foreign and domestic. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was more willing than Gore to expand use of the death  
penalty. Gore, but not Bradley, supported an international space 
station and a space-based missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley favored fewer U.S. troops in Europe but grudgingly voted  
to fund Nicaraguan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore voted to confirm President Reagan's nomination of Alan  
Greenspan as Federal Reserve chairman and President Bush's 
nomination of David Souter to the Supreme Court. Bradley was one of 
two dissenters on Greenspan, questioning his international 
experience, and one of nine dissenters on Souter, questioning his 
position on abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
	As for daylight-savings time, Bradley supported a move in 1986  
to change the ``spring ahead'' from the last Sunday to the first 
Sunday in April. Supporters of the measure said an extra hour of 
light at night would conserve energy, fight crime and help 
business. Opponents like Gore favored an hour of light in the early 
morning, when children leave for school. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a 1987 debate that pitted business against  
environmentalists, Gore helped derail limits on highway billboards 
that Bradley supported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate took 2,722 roll-call votes during the eight years  
Bradley and Gore served together -- from 1985, when Gore joined the 
Senate, until 1993, when Gore became vice president. In 585 of the 
roll calls, at least one of them did not vote, according to the AP 
analysis of vote tallies compiled by Congressional Quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bradley and Gore both cast votes or announced how they  
would have voted, they were on the same side 1,693 times, or on 79 
percent of the roll calls. They differed on the other 444 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutgers University political scientist Ross Baker said the  
aggregate numbers suggest Bradley and Gore are more alike than 
different. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not exactly joined at the hip, but they're certainly  
fraternal twins,'' Baker said. He estimated that the most 
ideologically aligned senators vote alike 80 percent to 90 percent 
of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said Friday that he and Gore have ``a lot of  
differences'' on issues and pledged to explore them in the fall. He 
said he tackled complex issues in the Senate, like international 
trade, international finance and taxation, while Gore was ``more 
cautious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said the vice president ``has a very  
long and distinguished record both in the House and the Senate on 
issues like the environment, high-tech, family policy and community 
empowerment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many votes that divided Bradley and Gore were variations on  
basic philosophical differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley voted numerous times to cut agricultural subsidy  
programs such as those for sugar, honey and peanuts, while Gore 
favored keeping the programs in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, Bradley supported attempts to transfer money  
from the international space station to veterans hospitals, urban 
development, clean-water programs, other science programs and 
deficit reduction. Each time, Gore supported keeping the money at 
NASA for the space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Gore, Bradley became a convert to American military  
involvement in Central America. He voted ``with misgivings and 
reservations'' in 1986 to send $100 million to the Contra rebels in 
Nicaragua, one of only 11 Democrats to vote with President Reagan. 
In 1987, Bradley opposed a congressional prohibition on introducing 
U.S. troops into Honduras or Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore voted to authorize use of military force against Iraq in  
1991; Bradley voted for a resolution urging continued sanctions and 
diplomatic efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore consistently supported the Strategic Defense Initiative  
while Bradley, at every opportunity, voted against SDI, the mobile 
MX missile and B-2 stealth bombers. Bradley also supported efforts 
to reduce American military overseas and to consider closing 
domestic military bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore defended ceilings on the federal deficit, while Bradley  
often favored increasing domestic spending in areas like 
environmental protection and education. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Bradley and Gore both say they support the death penalty,  
they differed in several instances on how it is applied. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley supported imposing the death penalty for certain  
drug-related crimes, for drug kingpins, and in the case of killings 
during crimes that violate the Civil Rights Act; Gore voted no in 
each case. In 1991, Bradley supported a move to impose the federal

<HEADLINE> Girl Walks in Justice's Shoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) -- Seventh-grader Rebecca DenHartigh is  
walking in Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's shoes. No, 
not following in her footsteps. She's really wearing her shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebecca is one of 25 students in Cindy Broekhuizen's  
seventh-grade language arts class at East Christian School who were 
assigned to choose a role model, write a research paper about the 
person and send the paper to them along with a request for a pair 
of their shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping this would give the students the opportunity to  
walk in someone's shoes and imagine what it would be like to be 
that person,'' Ms. Broekhuizen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks after Rebecca sent her letter to O'Connor, a Federal  
Express package arrived with a pair of size 8 1/2, light green, 
black-tipped, rubber-soled shoes once worn by the nation's first 
female Supreme Court justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebecca wore them the rest of the day.  
</P>
<P>
	``They fit perfectly,'' she told the Kalamazoo Gazette. ``I feel  
proud knowing that a person of such great importance would give me 
a pair of her shoes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only one other role model sent footwear: trumpeter Wynton  
Marsalis, who shipped a pair of size 9 shoes to William Karsten. 
Unlike Rebecca, William couldn't wear his new shoes-- his feet are 
size 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The shoes are staying at the school for a display.

<HEADLINE> Jenny Jones Defends Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Despite a $25 million verdict against her talk  
show, Jenny Jones said in an interview that the program is not to 
blame for the shooting death of a guest who revealed a gay crush on 
another guest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course I did soul searching. Of course after this happened  
we went back. I thought back about the show and we all, you know, 
we all talked about it. We then and now still feel we did nothing 
wrong,'' Ms. Jones told ``Dateline NBC'' interviewer Jane Pauley in 
an interview broadcast Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's not fair to blame the show for the actions of  
someone. That happened three days after they left the show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A jury last week held the show and its corporate owner, Warner  
Bros., liable in the shooting death of Scott Amedure, who had 
revealed his attraction to Jonathan Schmitz during a 1995 taping of 
the program. Amedure was shot dead three days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones said she might feel guilty if the two had been  
introduced on the show, but they had met beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	The First Amendment protects the right of ``The Jenny Jones  
Show'' to offer segments like the one about same-sex secret 
crushes, Ms. Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that compared to other shows, her program is ``probably  
the most lighthearted, fun show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure, 32, and Schmitz, then 24, were in Chicago on March 6,  
1995, to tape a segment for ``The Jenny Jones Show'' about secret 
crushes. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz, expecting to meet a woman, was kept offstage while  
Amedure declared his attraction to him and described a sexual 
fantasy involving Schmitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days later, Schmitz bought a shotgun and shells, drove to  
Amedure's mobile home and shot him to death. His 1996 conviction on 
second-degree murder charges was thrown out on a technicality. His 
retrial is set for this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The segment never aired.  
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Amedure's family argued that the show ``lit the  
fuse'' leading to his death by first deceiving, then embarrassing 
an already disturbed Schmitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones said the show made it clear to Schmitz that his  
admirer could be a man or woman, and that it had no way of knowing 
about Schmitz's suicide attempts or struggles against alcoholism.

<HEADLINE> Ball Field Upsets Neighbors in N.J. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Bill Ingraham was weaned on baseball,  
playing pickup games with his friends in the neighborhood every 
summer since he was 4 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Wanting to pass along his love the game to his son, Ingraham set  
about constructing a major-league-size field on his property, 
complete with batting cages and an indoor gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
	Now his neighbors are crying foul.  
</P>
<P>
	Tewksbury Township officials say Ingraham turned their quiet  
corner of horse country into something like Yankee Stadium -- with 
12-hour days filled with the pinging of aluminum bats, spectators' 
cheers and whistles. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a free-for-all back here,'' said Kathy DeSerio, whose  
yard borders Ingraham's left field. ``I like the Yankees. I don't 
know if I want the Yankees back in my back yard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of Ingraham's baseball diamond plan to go to court  
today in Flemington to argue that his $300,000 field of dreams 
violates township zoning laws and is a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingraham said he pays $1,500 a month to maintain the field for  
his 11-year-old son, Brian, and his son's friends. He goes to work 
every morning by 4 a.m. so he can leave by 2 p.m., in time to play 
on the field with the kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son enjoys it,'' Ingraham said. ``That's our thing.''  
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Terrence Scott, has argued that the field, which  
Ingraham never got a permit to build, should be considered an 
accessory to his property, much like a swimming pool or tennis 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	People in Tewksbury, a township of 5,000 with a median income of  
$98,000, wouldn't be as angry if Ingraham was indulging in the 
area's more popular sports of horseback riding or tennis, Scott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Township attorney James Knox said the field itself isn't a  
problem. What irks residents is Ingraham's attempt to have a 
professional facility in his backyard, and the constant comings and 
goings of players, parents and officials. 
</P>
<P>
	DeSerio and others have suggested that Ingraham charged league  
teams for the use of his field, and brought in professional 
instructors to teach children. Ingraham admits he initially had 
that idea and advertised a ``Field of Dreams Academy'' which 
offered lessons to children and a diamond for a ``35-and-over'' 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he abandoned the plan after township officials  
objected. 
</P>
<P>
	``People see this and say, `Why would he do this?' So they  
figure money has to be involved,'' Ingraham said. ``They haven't 
found a person who has paid a dime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks to limit the field's use even more than an  
existing court order that permits Ingraham to play only four days a 
week, and only in groups of five or less. Ingraham is seeking 
permission to field full teams for at least 15 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
	DeSerio, a hairdresser and garden designer who spent years  
restoring her Cape Cod-style home, said she's seen adults and boys 
playing baseball on Sundays, one of the days forbidden in the 
injunction. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said a realtor told her that her property has been  
devalued by up to $30,000 because of the field. And she's bothered 
by a night lighting system that she said floods her upstairs 
bedroom and back yard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to have the integrity of my property returned,'' she  
said. ``It's like living behind a 7-Eleven.''

	Clinton Sends Regrets to China  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton sent a message of regret  
today to Chinese President Jiang Zemin over the accidental bombing 
of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, the White House said. National 
security spokesman David Leavy said Clinton expressed ``regret on 
behalf of the American people for the tragic accident, explaining 
that it was not intentional, it was an unfortunate mistake.'' 
Chinese officials said the bombing killed three journalists and 
injured more than 20. But NATO officials today pledged to continue 
airstrikes until Yugoslav President Milosevic accepts a peace plan 
for Kosovo.

	Kosovo Refugees Celebrate Mom's Day  
</P>
<P>
	FORT DIX, N.J. (AP) -- Refugees from Kosovo celebrated their  
first American holiday today as children presented mothers with 
songs, cards and flowers at a picnic here. But it was hardly a 
happy Mother's Day for all 860 people sheltered at this southern 
New Jersey military post. Many await word of loved ones lost or 
separated during their exodus from the war-torn Yugoslav province. 
Still, soldiers and volunteers tried to keep spirits high with 
music, arts and crafts tables, cake and a clown. ``Urim Nene,'' 
many children wrote on the cards they made, which means ``Greetings 
to Mother.''

	Pakistan Plans Nuclear Celebrations  
</P>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- The government has planned 18 days of  
celebration to mark the first anniversary of an underground nuclear 
test. The festivities begin tomorrow with public rallies and 
seminars to mark the tests, which took place May 28 and May 30 last 
year. New songs are being written and state-run television is 
planning daily programs to honor the explosions. The government 
says the celebrations are to motivate Pakistan's 140 million people 
to work toward self-reliance.

	Entertainment Heads To Meet Clinton  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton says tomorrow's summit on  
youth violence is about finding answers, not assigning blame. But 
participants from the entertainment industry will be feeling more 
pressure than anyone else there, particularly since the gun lobby 
says it wasn't invited. The Colorado high school massacre has 
stirred debate over whether movies, music and video games have 
helped shape a culture of violence among teens. Meanwhile, the 
National Rifle Association, which met with protests when it held a 
meeting in Denver after the Columbine shootings, said that tomorrow 
it would ``unveil substantial proposals which would have an 
immediate and significant impact on violent crime in America.''

	Tornado Survivors Worship in Tent  
</P>
<P>
	BRIDGE CREEK, Okla. (AP) -- Hundreds of worshipers gathered in a  
mud-covered tent today for church services, almost a week after a 
deadly tornado ripped through this community. Half of a 
cement-block wall was all that stood at Ridgecrest Baptist Church. 
``I don't know if God took your home, but a tornado did, and God 
will rebuild your life,'' Pastor Tom Duckett told the crowd. Bridge 
Creek, a collection of two churches, a school and 8,000 residents, 
doesn't even appear on a map. It was here that Monday evening's 
tornado started. Eleven Bridge Creek residents died.

	Truck Loaded With Bees Crashes  
</P>
<P>
	FALMOUTH, Maine (AP) -- A truck carrying millions of bees  
overturned on a highway today, leaving its cargo buzzing around the 
wreckage and closing down the roadway for nearly eight hours. The 
truck was carrying between 400 and 450 hives, each home to between 
40,000 and 45,000 bees, a fire official said. He estimated there 
were about 20 million bees on the truck. About five firefighters 
were stung, but none were seriously hurt. On the advice of 
beekeepers, firefighters sprayed the hives with water to calm the 
bees as they loaded them onto another truck.

victory today, rebounding from a 4-2 loss in the second-round

Antonio past the Minnesota Timberwolves 99-86 in Game 1 of their 
playoff series today. The Timberwolves kept the contest close until 
the fourth quarter, when San Antonio opened a comfortable 
double-digit lead. David Robinson had 12 points and eight rebounds 
for the Spurs. Avery Johnson added 21 points and had 10 assists and 
Sean Elliott scored 14 points. Game 2 in the best-of-5 series is 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Victims Struggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGE CREEK, Okla. (AP) -- For 16 years, Monique and Billy Smith  
led the nomadic life of the military: Arkansas, Louisiana, 
Washington, Iceland, California, Rhode Island. A year and a half 
ago, they moved their three kids into a neat little brick ranch 
house southwest of Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	Perched on a hill overlooking a cow pasture, the house had  
everything. The hardwood floors were good for the kids' asthma. And 
there was finally enough room for each member of the family to set 
aside a quiet space to talk to God -- a prayer closet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a house we thanked God for every day,'' Mrs. Smith  
said. ``Because it was what we always wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't just a house. It was home.  
</P>
<P>
	The house is a shell now, torn apart by a gang of tornadoes that  
raked the Midwest this week and killed 46 people -- including seven 
of the Smiths' neighbors. The family of five has moved into a 
cramped hotel room miles away in Norman. 
</P>
<P>
	Like thousands of others across the region, the Smiths are  
facing an unknown period in borrowed space before they can rebuild. 
But while they've lost their houses, they're discovering that they 
are not homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing the Smith children needed to feel at home in the  
hotel was their Bibles. 
</P>
<P>
	For Becky and Chris Pillifant, home will be a relative's  
recreational vehicle until they can rebuild the three-bedroom brick 
house they bought three years ago in Oklahoma City's Southwest 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Pillifant sees living in the recreational vehicle as an  
adventure. ``It's got a great big queen-size bed,'' he says. ``You 
could park it anywhere and live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Pillifant isn't as thrilled with the prospect.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of nervous about it,'' she said, holding a blueberry  
muffin in her bandaged left hand. ``You know how tornadoes love 
trailer homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It might help if Mrs. Pillifant could decorate the RV with her  
collection of miniature villages, but they're all gone. Instead, 
she'll plaster the camper with pictures of her grandchildren who 
were rescued. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing is we're both together,'' her husband said.  
``It makes a home when we're both together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six months ago, Mary and James Huff of Moore took in their grown  
daughter when their son-in-law lost his job. Now, their daughter is 
returning the favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took them to Wal-Mart and bought them some clothes,'' said  
Sheri Harris, who is putting her two boys in bunk beds to make room 
for her parents in her three-bedroom apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the things that made Mrs. Huff's two-story house a home  
was her collection of family china -- three generations of it 
lovingly displayed in two cabinets. Not a piece survived. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was me,'' she said sadly. ``It's not replaceable.''  
</P>
<P>
	But neither is she.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care about the china cabinet I was going to get,''  
Mrs. Harris said. ``I've got her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To Mike Wood of Bridge Creek, home meant feeding Sugar, the  
family's 3-year-old buckskin horse, and tending the rows of beets, 
okra and cantaloupe in the garden out back. He took pride in the 
improvements he'd made to the 4-acre plot -- the white fences, the 
barn, the corral. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was it for the rest of our lives,'' he said. ``It wasn't  
no mansion, but it was our home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, for the first time in years, he is living with his mother  
in Oklahoma City, this time with a wife and two children. Daughter 
Angela, 16, is just trying to get used to sharing a sofa-bed with 
her 13-year-old brother, Dane. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kicks real hard,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sugar is boarding miles away, and there's no room for a garden.  
Wood is wondering how he will breathe until he can rebuild and get 
back to the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you live in town, the houses are so close together you  
can basically jump from roof to roof,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The thing that made Dr. James Rains feel at home in his  
one-story flagstone house was that it made him feel safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``People would ask, `Did you hear the storm?' one night or  
another,'' the Oklahoma City chiropractor said. ``I never heard it, 
this house was built so well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rains and his wife, Toni, are living in a hotel now, but he is  
thinking of planting a trailer where his house once stood. He wants 
to watch the workers put the salvaged building stones back in 
place. He thinks he can recreate that feeling of safety from the 
rubble he crawled out of. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to get the blueprint to do it all over again,'' he  
said as workers used a chain saw to cut up what was once his roof. 
``A lot of people are looking at this as if it's the end. I'm 
looking at it as a new beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some fear they will never feel quite at home again.  
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of the destruction in the city of Moore, Jim and  
Linda Fernandes' home looks relatively untouched. Aside from some 
blown-out windows and a few punctures, the brick-and-wood ranch 
seems intact next to the twisted remains of every other house on 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fernandes is looking for almost any reason to have to move --  
a split ridge beam in the attic, cracked brickwork under the eaves, 
anything. It seems habitable, but the thought of staying in a 
bulldozed wasteland for long months as others rebuild is just too 
much. If insurance adjustors say it's a complete loss, that OK with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope they total me,'' the retired federal employee said as  
he crunched through glass shards in his driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fernandeses moved into their home 33 years ago Thursday, the  
first in the neighborhood. They raised two daughters there, had 
their wedding receptions there. He planted flowering Bradford pear 
trees in the back yard and watched the neighbors' kids grow as his 
did. 
</P>
<P>
	At 63, Fernandes doesn't know if he has 33 years to pack such  
memories into another house. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my home, my kids' home, my grandkids' home,'' he said.  
``That's how they'll remember me. That's why I stayed here. It was 
supposed to be a legacy. I was never a mover. ... I'll never feel 
at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His wife's eyes fill with tears as she tries to reassure him.  
</P>
<P>
	``As long as we have each other, we'll have a home,'' she says.  
``The Lord will put us where he wants us to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Around the corner, Earl Capps is already building a new home in  
his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	When the storms approached Monday evening, the Moore school  
administrator was where he pretty much always was that time of day 
-- sitting in front of the television in his favorite recliner. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's right there; that's my chair,'' he said, pointing across  
the lawn to a broken beige blob with stuffing poking out all over. 
``I've had it about 15 years. It fit me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capps and his wife, Marquita, have traded their three-bedroom  
house for a one-bedroom apartment. They plan to rebuild on the same 
spot -- and he's already keeping an eye out for that next favorite 
chair. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an attitude thing,'' he says. ``Wherever we end up,  
that's going to become home -- whether it's the back of a pickup or 
in a penthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the spirit of Oklahoma. We went through the Murrah  
bombing. We're all survivors,'' he said. ``And once we rebuild and 
we're all back here, we're going to have a block party and 
celebrate life. Celebrate each other.''

<HEADLINE> Rangers Activate Burkett Off DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Right-hander John Burkett was activated  
by the Texas Rangers and was scheduled to start tonight against the 
Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	Left-handed reliever Eric Gunderson was put on the 15-day  
disabled list, retroactive to Saturday, because of tightness in his 
left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Burkett went onto the DL on April 21 because of bursitis in his  
right shoulder. In two rehab assignments with Double-A Tulsa, 
Burkett was 0-1 with a 2.70 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Burkett is 0-2 with a 12.00 ERA in three starts this season with  
the Rangers. His last outing was a 4-0 loss against the Yankees on 
April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunderson is 0-0 with a 7.20 ERA in 11 relief appearances.

<HEADLINE> `The Mummy' No. 1 at the Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Defying analysts, critics and The Force,  
``The Mummy'' bagged this year's biggest opening weekend at the box 
office with $44.6 million to kick off the blockbuster movie season. 
</P>
<P>
	The cat-burglar caper ``Entrapment'' slipped to second place  
with $12.2 million and the cyberspace adventure ``The Matrix'' fell 
to third with $6 million, estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	With lukewarm reviews, many expected ``The Mummy,'' a special  
effects-filled story of an ancient Egyptian priest who returns from 
the dead, to do mediocre business before dropping out of sight when 
the ``Star Wars'' prequel opens on May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, it probably did three times as much business as  
people were expecting,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, a movie analyst 
with Reel Source Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other films have been just hanging around the box office, but  
this had that kind of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' appeal,'' he said. 
``When you finally get a release like this, everybody goes wild.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With most studios giving a wide berth to the release of ``Star  
Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' Universal Pictures' move to 
open ``The Mummy'' just 12 days beforehand may pay off if 
word-of-mouth from audiences is favorable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mummy'' -- which also had the best non-summer opening ever  
-- was an impressive showing for star Brendan Fraser and easily beat 
his previous high opening of $16.5 million for ``George of the 
Jungle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also opening in wide release this weekend was the high school  
student government satire ``Election,'' starring Reese Witherspoon 
as a compulsive do-gooder and Matthew Broderick as a frumpy civics 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	The film opened in only a handful of theaters three weeks ago  
and rode a wave of positive reviews to fifth place this weekend

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Plans Virtual Clinic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- James Pittman woke one morning with a  
strong squeezing sensation in his chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspecting the worst, the 42-year-old Microsoft programmer  
wasted no time driving 10 miles to his doctor's office only to be 
told -- after ``a 2-second diagnosis'' -- he had pulled a back 
muscle, probably while painting his home the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what a heart attack feels like,'' he said. ``And  
I completely forgot that I was painting the house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next time Pittman feels the urge to see the doctor, he may have  
another option. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of driving across town on a workday, he could log on to  
his computer, make sure the small camera atop the monitor is 
correctly angled, then point and click to a Web site for 
``virtual'' treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to the ``virtual clinic'' -- futuristic employee health  
care that may soon be available to 13,800 Microsoft workers at 
company headquarters here, and 16,000 others around the country and 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may be another piece of the puzzle to economically extend  
health care to people wherever they are,'' said Dr. Bill Crounse of 
Overlake Hospital in nearby Bellevue, who is working with 
Microsoft's benefits group to make the virtual clinic a reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``The employees are just wild for this.''  
</P>
<P>
	But they may have to wait a while. The concept is so new the  
American Medical Association has never heard of it. Even Microsoft 
has no idea when it will become a reality, spokesman Dan Leach 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone thinks it's a great idea.  
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Court, director of Consumers for Quality Care, a Santa  
Monica, Calif.-based advocacy group, said practicing medicine via 
computer to cut costs is a slippery slope that could lead to poor 
patient care and litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality is you don't know what a patient needs until you  
see the patient,'' Court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some medical centers already have the capacity for face-to-face  
two-way conferencing -- often called telemedicine -- to provide 
consultation services and collegial help to doctors, usually in 
rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	But new and cheaper computer technologies are rapidly bringing  
that capacity into people's homes and offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Crounse believes the virtual clinic will function in the  
workplace within the year, and will be available in some homes 
within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't do it, someone else will,'' he said in an  
interview. ``It's the missing link in health care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Microsoft is ``a natural partner'' for the pioneering  
effort, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only are its employees more computer savvy than most and  
more likely to have the required hardware, software and bandwidth, 
but many are what Crounse calls ``the worried well'' -- prone to 
visit doctors for colds and flus, sprains and strains. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft workers already have access to a watered-down version  
of the virtual clinic from their desktops. Crounse receives a 
steady stream of e-mails -- five or 10 a week -- from employees who 
click on an ``Ask the doctor'' link on the benefits Web site on the 
company intranet. 
</P>
<P>
	He handles most of the queries himself, referring about 15  
percent to any of 55 specialists in his e-mail bank and others to 
helpful Internet sites -- all at no cost to employees. Leach 
declined to disclose any costs to Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers tap the e-mail link for advice on whether a whiplash  
victim should seek help first from a chiropractor or a physical 
therapist, if it's safe for a mother to give a small dose of adult 
cold-sore medication to her 4-year-old and the like. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's only a taste of things to come, Crounse told a group  
of employees on the Microsoft campus recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Using Microsoft's NETMeeting software, Crounse demonstrated how  
a doctor and patient in a virtual clinic could see, hear and talk 
to each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor could call up computer images -- an anatomical drawing  
of a back, perhaps -- and have the patient indicate exactly where it 
hurts. He could fill out an electronic prescription, e-mail it to 
an online drugstore that offers home delivery and e-mail the 
patient home-care instructions and details of his or her next 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	A virtual visit would include everything but the physical  
prodding and poking of a real-world visit to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Crounse, vice president and chief information officer at  
Overlake, does not advocate doing away with the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to make a diagnosis or provide patient care''  
at the virtual clinic, he said. ``It's more informational, pointing 
people in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between 20 percent and 30 percent of doctor visits are  
unnecessary, and just as readily dealt with from the desktop, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A virtual visit, like a phone call, would help doctors screen  
out needless actual visits -- and, says Crounse, potentially save 
employers money. 
</P>
<P>
	By one estimate, Americans make an average of five visits a year  
to the doctor, taking between one-third to one-half a day off work 
each time. 
</P>
<P>
	A '90s trend of insistence on greater access to health  
information bodes well for the virtual clinic idea, says Greg 
Vigdor, senior vice president of the Washington State Hospital 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there would probably be strict protocols on how it would  
work,'' to prevent lawsuits arising from incorrect assessments of 
patient needs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's just one of several hurdles the idea faces.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are huge issues in terms of patient, physician and  
(insurance) payer acceptance,'' Counse said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least some of the issues stem from the hybrid nature of the  
idea. 
</P>
<P>
	How, for example, should doctors bill patients for visits that  
are not quite face-to-face meetings, which doctors typically charge 
for, but more than telephone calls, which most do not? 
</P>
<P>
	Crounse says visits to the virtual clinic wouldn't be free -- the  
demands on doctors' time would be the same as in face-to-face 
consultations, and start-up and other computer costs would exceed 
those of owning a telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's confident it would be cheaper than a real-world doctor  
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	And, if some doctors eventually operate exclusively on a virtual  
basis -- in partnership with real-world doctors -- it could be 
cheaper still, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even those most familiar with the virtual-clinic concept said  
they could not guess at the costs. It's too soon, Leach said -- 
though he expects Microsoft employees may have to kick in for a 
full-fledged virtual clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	The concept could work, said spokeswoman Barbara Stenson in the  
office of state Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn, ``if people 
like it and if doctors like it, and carriers and companies feel 
it's cost effective'' -- which she predicted they would. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might act as a screener'' to reduce insurance claims and  
thus cut costs -- savings that could be passed on to consumers in 
the form of lower premiums, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Crounse and team don't need all the answers. Getting a  
prototype off the ground is their prime concern. Insurance issues 
have yet to arise -- Microsoft is self-insured, so its health 
insurance programs are not regulated by the commissioner's office.

<HEADLINE> NHL Playoffs Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	As defending Stanley Cup champions, the Detroit Red Wings have  
been regarded as the team to beat in the playoffs. So far, nobody 
has been able to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings are 6-0 in the postseason, and going home for two  
games following Sunday's 4-0 victory at Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're playing with lots of energy,'' Colorado coach Bob  
Hartley said. ``They're playing better as a team than we are right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's victory was a little easier for the Red Wings than the  
opener of their Western Conference semifinal series, a 3-2 overtime 
thriller. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never talked about going home up 2-0,'' Red Wings captain  
Steve Yzerman said. ``By no means can we relax. They could get back 
into this one if we aren't careful. Remember, the Avalanche have a 
great road record (3-0 in the playoffs), better than at home 
(1-4).'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other games Sunday, Buffalo beat Boston 3-1 and Toronto  
defeated Pittsburgh 4-2 to tie each of those Eastern Conference 
series at a game apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	The playoffs continue tonight with Dallas at St. Louis holding a  
2-0 lead in their best-of-7 Western Conference semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzerman scored two goals and Bill Ranford gained his fourth  
career playoff shutout to lead the Red Wings, who won their 11th 
straight playoff game dating to last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit, seeking a third consecutive Stanley Cup, gave coach  
Scotty Bowman his 200th career playoff win -- extending his NHL 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzerman scored in each of the first two periods, giving him  
eight goals in the playoffs to equal a career high. Nicklas 
Lidstrom and Wendel Clark added power-play goals in the final 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranford, the 1990 NHL playoff MVP with Edmonton, started his  
second straight game in goal in place of the injured Chris Osgood, 
who is out with a sprained right knee. He had 28 saves, preserving 
his shutout with a diving stop on Peter Forsberg late in the first 
period and with back-to-back stops on Theo Fleury and Sylvain 
Lefebvre in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys played unbelievably in front of me,'' Ranford said.  
``There were times when I didn't see the puck, and they were able 
to block it out for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Roy had 33 saves in the Colorado net.  
</P>
<P>
	Games 3 and 4 will be played in Detroit on Tuesday and  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Sabres 3, Bruins 1    	
</P>
<P>
	Goaltender Dominik Hasek, rebounding from an opening-game loss,  
looked more like the NHL's two-time MVP as the visiting Sabres beat 
the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, looking a lot sharper than he did in the Sabres' 4-2 loss  
to Boston on Thursday, stopped 28 of 29 shots this time as Buffalo 
wiped out the Bruins' home-ice advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek seemed headed for his fifth career playoff shutout before  
Don Sweeney scored on a power play with 5:57 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Peca, Curtis Brown and Dixon Ward scored for the Sabres,  
who will host the next two games of the series on Wednesday and 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Maple Leafs 4, Penguins 2    	
</P>
<P>
	Mats Sundin broke out of his scoring slump to lead the Maple  
Leafs over the visiting Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundin scored his second and third postseason goals and assisted  
on goals by Steve Thomas and Lonny Bohonos, recently brought up 
from the minors to start on the Maple Leafs' first line. 
</P>
<P>
	Kip Miller and German Titov beat Curtis Joseph, who was  
otherwise at his acrobatic best. 
</P>
<P>
	The series switches to Pittsburgh for Games 3 and 4 on Tuesday  
and Thursday.

<HEADLINE> CIA Error Blamed for Bombing Mixup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A CIA error that was based on faulty  
information and then went undetected in subsequent checks led to 
the mistaken NATO targeting and bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 
Belgrade, a U.S. official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  
intended target, the Yugoslav Federal Directorate of Supply and 
Procurement, was chosen by the CIA. Other organizations, including 
NATO, the U.S. European Command and the Pentagon's Joint Staff, 
reviewed and approved it, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This went through all these hoops, but for whatever reason it  
was not detected,'' the official said of the mistake. The Chinese 
Embassy is several hundred yards away from the Yugoslav government 
supply office. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the target planning in the allied air campaign is done  
by NATO, the U.S. European Command and the Pentagon, with the CIA 
playing a smaller role, the official said. CIA officials are still 
reviewing their own published and clandestine sources to determine 
how they misidentified the embassy, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO and President Clinton offered further apologies Sunday for  
the bombing, but no further information about how the mistake 
occurred or who was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the House  
intelligence committee, said the bombing shows that America's 
intelligence capabilities are stretched too thin and that such 
mistakes will happen as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	``I say it's a reaping of the harvest of the underinvestment in  
our intelligence capabilities,'' Goss said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goss's Senate counterpart, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., agreed:  
``We've been doing defense, which intelligence is part and parcel 
of, on the cheap for about 13 straight years, and now you're seeing 
the fruits of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is seeking about $29 billion for intelligence  
programs in the 2000 budget, an increase of about 9 percent. But 
critics say that proposed increase comes after years in which 
intelligence spending has effectively declined. Only a small 
portion of that budget goes to the CIA: much is for spy satellites 
and military intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton apologized to the Chinese on Saturday, and again Sunday  
in a message to the Chinese president, and Defense Secretary 
William Cohen and CIA Director George Tenet issued a joint 
statement late Saturday night acknowledging that ``faulty 
information'' was behind the error. 
</P>
<P>
	They stressed that ``a review of our procedures has convinced us  
that this was an anomaly that is unlikely to happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA had no additional comment on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	NATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Wesley Clark, said on ABC's  
``This Week'' that there have been 18,000 bombing runs in the 
seven-week campaign but fewer than a dozen instances of hitting 
civilians or weapons going astray. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was ``the most precise, effective and collateral  
damage-free air operation that has ever been conducted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the embassy bombing has further strained already tense  
relations between the United States and China. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met Saturday night with Li  
Zhaoxing, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, to express 
regrets and seek assurances that U.S. embassy staff in Beijing, 
which has been under siege from thousands of Chinese demonstrators 
protesting the bombing, be protected. The State Department also has 
issued an advisory cautioning Americans against travel in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers on Sunday also warned the Chinese government not to  
seek political advantage from the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that the Chinese are orchestrating this for some  
political reason,'' Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said on NBC's ``Meet 
the Press.'' ``It should stop immediately and it can have long-term 
repercussions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering, appearing on ABC and  
CNN's ``Late Edition,'' said the bombing could be a ``temporary 
setback'' in diplomatic efforts to end the military campaign, but 
``it doesn't seem to me in light of where the Chinese have been 
that they would veto a peace settlement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pickering said someone would have to be ``certifiably looney''  
to believe that NATO purposely targeted the Chinese embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Li, the Chinese ambassador, who also appeared on ABC,  
condemned what he said was an effort to ``whitewash the atrocity'' 
The attack, which he said killed three and wounded 20, ``is no 
ordinary incident. It is a horrifying atrocity.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Singapore Layoffs Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- About 2,800 workers reportedly lost their jobs  
in Singapore in the first three months this year -- a steep drop 
from the 8,000 layoffs in the last quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing figures from the Manpower Ministry, The Sunday Times said  
the unemployment rate in the city-state has dropped to 3.9 percent 
from 4.4 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``But compared to our normal unemployment rate of 2 percent,  
it's still very high,'' Manpower Minister Lee Boon Yang was quoted 
as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	A record 28,300 people were laid off in Singapore last year, the  
highest number since 19,529 jobs were lost in 1985 during the last 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the way to recovery was the manufacturing sector, which  
accounted for 28 percent of layoffs this year. In comparison, 
two-thirds of all layoffs were in the manufacturing industry last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee attributed the industry's recovery to reliance on exports to  
the United States and Europe, where demand was still strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sectors, such as finance, commerce and business services,  
were more closely linked to the region, which is still battling the 
economic crisis, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as our neighboring countries have not made a complete  
recovery, these sectors' prospects will be affected,'' Lee said.

<HEADLINE> Compaq To Cut Distributors to Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. is expected to announce  
plans today to slash the number of distributors who sell its 
products to four from about 40. 
</P>
<P>
	A conference call has been scheduled for today, but the company  
told analysts late Friday, said Ashok Kumar at U.S. Bancorp Piper 
Jaffray. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've talked about consolidation under the old regime for  
quite some time,'' Kumar said Saturday. ``I think for the first 
time we're starting to see decisive action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move would be chairman Ben Rosen's first major move since  
supplanting Eckhard Pfeiffer as chief executive last month. The 
idea is to allow Compaq to lower costs and better manage inventory 
and track demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Kumar identified Ingram Micro, Tech Data Corp., Merisel and  
CompuCom Systems as the surviving distributors. The companies 
already work very closely with the Houston-based computer giant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think very clearly this makes sense in that it gives Compaq  
more control over logistics,'' Kumar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones News Wires also identified Inacom as a distributor  
likely making the cut. Stock prices for all five companies rose 
sharply Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq did not publicly confirm or deny the report. Shares rose  
25 cents to $24.87 1/2 in heavy trading Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kumar, who expressed confidence last month that Rosen could  
stimulate Compaq after recent sluggish performance, applauded his 
transitional management team for the distribution decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows they're making difficult decisions and making them  
decisively,'' Kumar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Directors ousted Pfeiffer on April 18, nine days after the  
company announced first-quarter earnings would fall far short of 
analysts' expectations. The news plunged Compaq stock by 22 percent 
April 12.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Up in East, Down in West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gas prices rose in most parts of the  
country, while dropping about 5 cents in the West as the effects of 
refinery problems wore off, an industry analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil price hikes caused pump prices to rise about 1 to 2  
cents per gallon in the East and Midwest, according to the Lundberg 
Survey of 10,000 stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The national weighted average, including all grades and taxes,  
was $1.2337 per gallon Friday, a 0.41 cent rise from two weeks 
earlier, analyst Trilby Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fatal explosions and problems in several California refineries  
caused prices to skyrocket in the West recently. However, increased 
supplies of gasoline have stabilized the market and are expected to 
continue knocking down prices in the West, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices have risen more than 23 cents per gallon since they  
bottomed out on Feb. 19, but over the past month the increases have 
been very small, she said. ``It looks like they are losing 
momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A nationwide gasoline boycott organized for April 30 by consumer  
groups angry about price hikes succeeded in lowering sales on that 
day but may have had little long-term effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prices were down that day, but they were up the day before and  
the day after,'' Ms. Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC and Mexico's decision to cut back on oil production may  
continue to force gas prices slightly higher in other regions, Ms. 
Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average prices at self-service stations was $1.1767 per  
gallon for regular gasoline, $1.2783 for mid-grade and $1.3628 for 
premium. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-service prices were $1.5356 for regular, $1.6220 for  
mid-grade and $1.6954 for premium.

	China Protesters Decry NATO Attack  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Furious Chinese demonstrators hurled rocks and  
debris into the U.S. Embassy on Sunday, trapping American diplomats 
inside their compound in a second day of protests against NATO's 
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia. Most protesters went 
home early Monday, allowing some diplomats to leave the 
ambassador's residence. There were no demonstrators, but helmeted 
police stood in rows three deep in front of the embassy gate, and 
new police were being moved into the area as if expecting a third 
day of demonstrations. On Sunday, thousands flowed past the main 
U.S. Embassy buildings in Beijing, while others attacked the 
British and Albanian missions and protested at U.S. consulates 
elsewhere.

	CIA Error Blamed for Bombing Mixup  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A CIA error that was based on faulty  
information and then went undetected led to the mistaken NATO 
targeting and bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, a U.S. 
official said today. The official said the intended target, the 
Yugoslav Federal Directorate of Supply and Procurement, was chosen 
by the CIA. Other organizations, including NATO, the U.S. European 
Command and the Pentagon's Joint Staff, approved it. The embassy is 
several hundred yards away from the Yugoslav government office. 
NATO and President Clinton offered further apologies today for the 
bombing.

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian and Israeli officials held  
last-minute meetings today over the closing of offices at the PLO's 
headquarters, seeking to avert a confrontation days before Israeli 
elections. Israeli police officials met with a lawyer for the 
Orient House headquarters past a 7 p.m. deadline set by Israel to 
shut down the complex, and negotiators agreed to meet again 
tomorrow. Israel's Cabinet decided earlier this month to close 
three offices in Orient House, saying they had ties to the 
Palestinian Authority that, under interim peace agreements, is not 
allowed to operate in Jerusalem. The Palestinians have said the 
offices are not connected to the authority.

<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A chartered bus carrying members of a seniors  
casino club on a Mother's Day gambling excursion ran off a highway 
this morning and crashed, killing 23 people, authorities said. 
Seventeen more were hospitalized, nine in critical or guarded 
condition, and three were released after emergency room treatment. 
The bus swerved from the left lane off of the highway, then across 
a narrow paved narrow path for golf carts that emerges from a 
tunnel next to the highway, crashing down one embankment and up the 
other.

	Jenny Jones Defends Show  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Despite a $25 million verdict against her talk  
show, Jenny Jones said in an interview that the program is not to 
blame for the shooting death of a guest who revealed a gay crush on 
another guest. ``I think it's not fair to blame the show for the 
actions of someone. That happened three days after they left the 
show,'' Ms. Jones told ``Dateline NBC'' in an interview broadcast 
today. A jury last week held the show and its corporate owner, 
Warner Bros., liable in the shooting death of Scott Amedure, who 
had revealed his attraction to Jonathan Schmitz during a 1995 
taping of the program. Amedure was shot dead three days later.

the Lakers beat the Houston Rockets 101-100 to open the playoffs.

	BOSTON (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres evened their playoff series  
with the Boston Bruins and, naturally, they can thank Dominik 
Hasek. The NHL's best goalie weathered a late onslaught for a 3-1 
victory today, rebounding from a 4-2 loss in the second-round 
opener. The Sabres hope Miroslav Satan, who led them with 40 
regular-season goals, will have recovered enough from a bruised 
foot to return after missing his third straight game.

<HEADLINE> 'The Mummy' Wraps Up No. 1 Spot / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Mummy'' took advantage of a pre-''Star  
Wars'' box office drought to wrap up this year's biggest opening 
weekend with $44.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The cat-burglar caper ``Entrapment'' slipped to second with  
$12.2 million and cyberspace adventure ``The Matrix'' was third 
with $6 million, estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	With lukewarm reviews, many expected ``The Mummy'' -- a special  
effects-filled story of an ancient Egyptian priest who returns from 
the dead -- to do mediocre business before dropping out of sight 
when the ``Star Wars'' prequel opens May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, it probably did three times as much business as  
people were expecting,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, a Reel Source Inc. 
movie analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other films have been just hanging around the box office, but  
this had that kind of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' appeal,'' he said. 
``When you finally get a release like this, everybody goes wild.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With most studios giving a wide berth to the opening of ``Star  
Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' Universal Pictures' daring 
move to open ``The Mummy'' just 12 days earlier may pay off if 
word-of-mouth is favorable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mummy'' -- which also had the best non-summer opening ever  
-- was an impressive showing for star Brendan Fraser and easily beat 
his previous high opening of $16.5 million for ``George of the 
Jungle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The first five days of 'Star Wars' will be sold out, so 'The  
Mummy' may actually benefit by being the only alternative,'' 
Bucksbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also opening in wide release this weekend was the high school  
student government satire ``Election,'' starring Reese Witherspoon 
as a compulsive do-gooder and Matthew Broderick as a frumpy civics 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	The film opened in only a handful of theaters three weeks ago  
and rode a wave of positive reviews to fifth place this weekend 
with $3.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Analyze This'' crossed the $100 million mark this week,  
earning $1.8 million for seventh place. It has grossed a total of 
$100.9 million in 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Weekend ticket sales were 12.2 percent higher than the same  
weekend last year, when ``Deep Impact'' debuted as ``City of 
Angels'' and ``Titanic'' began to slip. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Inc., with final figures 
to be released today: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Mummy,'' $44.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Entrapment,'' $12.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The Matrix,'' $6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Life,'' $3.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Election,'' $3.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Never Been Kissed,'' $3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Analyze This,'' $1.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``10 Things I Hate About You,'' $1.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Cookie's Fortune,'' $900,000.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Shakespeare in Love,'' $765,000.

activated from the disabled list Sunday and was in the lineup in 
the Royals' game against the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dog Helps Woman Cope With Panic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CATONSVILLE, Md. (AP) -- The smell of a cigarette. The sound of  
footsteps behind her. Little things like these can trigger Lisa 
Conti's panic attacks and return her to the night she was raped. 
</P>
<P>
	She remembers the day in 1987 when, as an Army private in South  
Korea, she was jumped from behind, dragged into a car and driven to 
a place where she was raped by four men and tortured with lit 
cigarettes. She begins sweating and can't breathe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could be sitting at home, all by myself, and I could have  
one,'' Ms. Conti said, sitting on her living room couch, her arm 
tucked around her dog, King, her fingers stroking his black fur. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Conti rescued King from an animal shelter in May 1994 on the  
day he was to be euthanized. Little did she know he would end up 
saving her. 
</P>
<P>
	``King is my lifeline to the world,'' Ms. Conti said.  
</P>
<P>
	King, a 6-year-old spaniel mix, is a registered service dog. He  
senses when Ms. Conti is going to have a panic attack and sometimes 
can help prevent them. 
</P>
<P>
	Guide dogs for the blind have been around for 80 years, but  
using dogs for ``invisible disabilities'' is relatively new. Dogs 
now are being trained to help people with such problems as 
depression, bipolar disorder and agoraphobia, said Susan Duncan, 
manager of the service dog center at Delta Society, a nonprofit 
group in Renton, Wash., that promotes the health benefits of 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows for sure how King senses when Ms. Conti is about to  
have a panic attack. He may be responding to changes in scent 
caused by changes in body chemistry, Ms. Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Training will reinforce what the dogs will want to do naturally  
when their owners are distressed: lean against their owners, nuzzle 
them and stand between them and a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I would have a panic attack, he would come up and put his  
body against me,'' Ms. Conti said. ``It helped keep me out of what 
was happening inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Stephens, of Norman, Okla., isn't sure how Chief, his  
German shepherd mix, knows when he's about to have a panic attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens' doctor prescribed a service dog to help with  
post-traumatic stress from serving in Vietnam. Chief proved 
invaluable one winter day while Stephens was driving over an icy 
pass between Laramie and Cheyenne, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden Chief, who was in back of the station wagon,  
began whining and nuzzling my neck,'' Stephens said. ``Then 
something popped into my head. `This dog knows something I don't.' 
No sooner had I pulled to the side of the road and gotten that car 
in park, I had a full-blown panic attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens relies on Chief to alert him to take his anti-anxiety  
drug before he has an attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I don't have meds, he gets me through it by just sitting  
there nuzzling,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, people with physical  
and mental impairments that ``substantially limit one or more major 
life activities'' can have a trained service dog with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the law, Ms. Conti says she has a hard time getting  
people to understand that King is entitled to go where she goes. 
</P>
<P>
	Shari Sternberger, founder of National Capital Therapy Dogs in  
Highland, Md., says taking away a mentally disabled person's 
service dog is equivalent to removing glasses from a near-sighted 
person or a cane from someone with a limp. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dog is considered ... a medical appliance, nothing more or  
nothing less. That appliance allows her to function in life,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Conti has been turned away from restaurants, shops, even the  
Baltimore Orioles ballpark. Recently, she got a photo 
identification card for King from the Department of Veterans 
Affairs that she hopes will help people understand her disability. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Ms. Conti was discharged from the Army on April 21,  
1989, her psychological problems were overwhelming. Over the next 
six years, she was hospitalized more than 100 times. She was too 
fearful to walk to the end of her driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John Butchart, a staff psychologist at the Veterans  
Administration Hospital in Baltimore, thought a companion dog would 
be good for her. He had no idea the dog would be critical to her 
feeling of well-being. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before she got this animal she was extremely timid, very  
retiring, almost agoraphobic,'' he said. ``Now she is different. 
... She has become much more assertive, far more confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Ms. Conti is having a nightmare, King will come and lick her  
hand until she wakes up. If a panic attack occurs when she is 
attending class at the local community college, King will steer her 
toward a quiet corner and stay with her until her terror subsides. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't understand that you are frozen. You can't move,  
you're shaking and you're sweating, but there is nothing going on 
around you. He leads me away,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Conti, who was last hospitalized in 1996, takes no  
psychiatric medication. She holds a job and is going to college to 
become a park ranger. Although she has two or three panic attacks a 
month, she says they are tolerable, thanks to King.

<HEADLINE> One Shot Ends Young's 15-Game Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Kevin Young wasn't pleased at the way his  
career-best 15-game hitting streak ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pittsburgh Pirates' first baseman thought he was getting his  
first day off of the season because manager Gene Lamont wanted to 
give Turner Ward some at-bats today. 
</P>
<P>
	But Young was inserted in the eighth inning of a 12-9 victory  
over the St. Louis Cardinals during a double switch and batted in 
the ninth, popping out to first base in his lone at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 23-for-61 (.377) during the streak with three homers, 14  
RBIs and 12 runs scored. His RBI streak ended at eight games, four 
short of the team record set by Paul Waner in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
	``My big thing is I wanted to play today,'' Young said. ``When  
you're swinging the bat well, you don't want to sit, and that's the 
bottom line. To end it like that, on a personal note, it is 
disappointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young said he felt pressure on his only at-bat against Mike  
Mohler. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing you can do but hope you get a good pitch to  
hit,'' he said.

<P>
	Today is Monday, May 10, the 130th day of 1999. There are 235  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	One hundred years ago, on May 10, 1899, movie musical star Fred  
Astaire was born in Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1774, Louis the 16th ascended the throne of France.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1775, Ethan Allen and his Green Mountain Boys captured the  
British-held fortress at Ticonderoga, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1818, American patriot Paul Revere died in Boston.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1865, Union forces captured Confederate President Jefferson  
Davis in Irwinville, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1869, a golden spike was driven at Promontory, Utah, marking  
the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1924, J. Edgar Hoover was given the job of FBI director.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1933, the Nazis staged massive public book burnings in  
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1941, Adolf Hitler's deputy, Rudolf Hess, parachuted into  
Scotland on what he claimed was a peace mission. (Hess ended up 
serving a life sentence at Spandau prison until 1987, when he 
apparently committed suicide.) 
</P>
<P>
	In 1968, preliminary Vietnam peace talks began in Paris.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, Britain's Princess Margaret and the Earl of Snowdon  
announced they were divorcing after 18 years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: In Panama, the government of Gen. Manuel Antonio  
Noriega announced it had nullified the country's elections, which 
independent observers said the opposition had won by a 3-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: The state of Illinois executed convicted serial  
killer John Wayne Gacy for the murders of 33 young men and boys. 
Nelson Mandela took the oath of office to become South Africa's 
first black president. An annular, or ``ring'' eclipse, cast a 
moving shadow across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: The FAA grounded older models of the Boeing 737  
after mandatory inspections of some aircraft found extensive wear 
in power lines through wing fuel tanks. Sinn Fein leader Gerry 
Adams won full backing for the Northern Ireland peace accord in a 
fundamental reversal of decades-old policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Birthdays: Former House Speaker Carl Albert is 91.  
Sportscaster Pat Summerall is 69. TV and radio personality Gary 
Owens is 63. Rhythm-and-blues singer Henry Fambrough (The Spinners) 
is 61. Writer-producer-director Jim Abrahams is 55. Singer Donovan 
Leitch is 53. Singer Dave Mason is 53. Rhythm-and-blues singer Ron 
Banks (The Dramatics) is 48. Rock singer Bono (U2) is 39. Rock 
musician Krist Novoselic (Nirvana) is 34. Rapper Young MC is 32. 
Rhythm-and-blues singer Jason Dalyrimple (Soul For Real) is 19.

<P>
	Thought for Today: ``A man who works with his hands is a  
laborer; a man who works with his hands and his brain is a 
craftsman; but a man who works with his hands and his brain and his 
heart is an artist.''-- Louis Nizer, American lawyer (1902-1994).

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Up in East, Down in West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gas prices rose in most parts of the  
country, though dropped about 5 cents in the West as the effects of 
refinery problems wore off, an industry analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil price hikes caused pump prices to rise about 1 to 2  
cents per gallon in the East and Midwest, according to the Lundberg 
Survey of 10,000 stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The national weighted average, including all grades and taxes,  
was $1.2337 per gallon Friday, a 0.41 cent rise from two weeks 
earlier, analyst Trilby Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fatal explosions and problems in several California refineries  
caused prices to skyrocket in the West recently. However, increased 
supplies of gasoline have stabilized the market and are expected to 
continue knocking down prices in the West, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices have risen more than 23 cents per gallon since they  
bottomed out on Feb. 19, but over the past month the increases have 
been very small, she said. ``It looks like they are losing 
momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A nationwide gasoline boycott organized for April 30 by consumer  
groups angry about price hikes succeeded in lowering sales on that 
day but may have had little long-term effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prices were down that day, but they were up the day before and  
the day after,'' Ms. Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC and Mexico's decision to cut back on oil production may  
continue to force gas prices slightly higher in other regions, Ms. 
Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average prices at self-service stations was $1.1767 per  
gallon for regular gasoline, $1.2783 for mid-grade and $1.3628 for 
premium. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-service prices were $1.5356 for regular, $1.6220 for  
mid-grade and $1.6954 for premium.

<HEADLINE> Aussie IOC Member Urged To Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australia's Sports Minister has urged  
embattled International Olympic Committee member Phil Coles to 
resign from the Sydney Games board. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was expected to meet with fellow Australian IOC member  
Kevan Gosper on Monday, with reports suggesting Gosper was carrying 
a request from IOC chief Juan Antonio Samaranch that Coles quit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports Minister Jackie Kelly added her voice to a chorus of  
Coles critics Monday, saying Coles had been urged by every 
``sportsman, sports coach, sportswoman and sports administrator to 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His time has come,'' Kelly said.  
</P>
<P>
	Coles, who has stood aside from the SOCOG board pending several  
IOC investigations, said he would not be talked into quitting by 
Gosper. 
</P>
<P>
	``My position has not changed,'' Coles said Monday. ``I have to  
appear before the (IOC) and Mr. Gosper has no role to play in that. 
The (IOC) meeting will take place and I'll present my case and I'll 
be cleared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC announced last week it had deferred until June a  
decision on an investigation into whether Coles accepted expensive 
jewelry from a businessman associated with Athens' failed 1996 bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC earlier had reprimanded Coles for accepting excessive  
hospitality and travel from the successful 2002 Salt Lake City bid 
team and warned him any further indiscretion would result in 
expulsion.

<HEADLINE> Sears To Stay As WNBA Sponsor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. has extended its  
partnership the WNBA for another three years, the first of the 
women's professional basketball league sponsors to renew its 
initial deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms were not disclosed but the deal for the years 2000 through  
2002 includes commercials on Women's National Basketball 
Association telecasts, on-court signs at all WNBA arenas and sales 
of WNBA merchandise in Sears stores. The department store chain's 
current three-year deal extends through this season. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, it was announced that Sears will be the presenting  
sponsor of the first WNBA All-Star game to be held July 14 in New 
York. It will conduct balloting for the teams at its stores as well 
as over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears is among a dozen companies who have been with the WNBA  
since the league's opening season in 1997. Other sponsors include 
General Motors Corp., American Express Co. and Anheuser-Busch Cos. 
</P>
<P>
	The league expands to a dozen teams this season from 10 last  
year. Each team plays a 32-game regular season starting June 10 
with the playoffs winding up near Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	John Lebbad, Sears director of event marketing and sales  
promotion, said Friday that Sears sales have risen as a result of 
its first two years as a WNBA sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the arrangement helps the retailer based in Hoffman  
Estates, Ill., near Chicago strengthen its appeal to its core 
customer -- women between 25 and 54 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Val Ackerman, president of the WNBA, said the league is starting  
to talk with other sponsors about renewing partnership deals.

<HEADLINE> Actress Plato Dies of Overdose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOORE, Okla. (AP) -- Actress Dana Plato, who like her fellow  
``Diff'rent Strokes'' child co-stars had seen legal troubles since 
the show was canceled, has died of a drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato, 34, apparently took the painkiller Loritab along with  
Valium on Saturday while visiting the home of her fiance's parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The death appears to be an accidental overdose. We don't  
suspect suicide,'' police Sgt. Scott Singer said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato played Kimberly Drummond on the NBC sitcom that ran  
from 1978 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	She was arrested in 1991 for robbing a Las Vegas video store,  
and was placed on five years' probation. In 1992 she was given an 
additional five years' probation for forging prescriptions for 
Valium. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I hadn't gotten caught, it could have been the worst thing  
that happened to me because I could have died of a drug overdose,'' 
she told reporters in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato and her fiance, Robert Menchaca, had stopped at his  
parents' home in Moore for Mother's Day. Ms. Plato and Menchaca, 
28, were en route to Los Angeles after she appeared on the Howard 
Stern's radio program in New York as part of an effort to 
jump-start her career. 
</P>
<P>
	She went on the show to deny the stories of a woman who claimed  
to know Ms. Plato well. The woman had called Stern's show, saying 
Ms. Plato was on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato acknowledged the woman had been a roommate, but said  
she had been sober for about 10 years. She also said she had her 
wisdom teeth out about four months ago and had to take pain killers 
for that. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer said Ms. Plato went to take a nap Saturday afternoon.  
After Menchaca realized that evening that there was a problem, his 
mother, who's a nurse, and his brother tried unsuccessfully to 
revive her with cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer says toxicology results aren't expected for about six  
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato's recent career had included mainly low-budget films  
such as 1992's ``Bikini Beach Race'' and the 1997 film ``Different 
Strokes: A Story of Jack and Jill ... and Jill,'' a direct-to-video 
softcore tale about a sexual threesome. 
</P>
<P>
	Among her co-stars on ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' Todd Bridges, who  
played Willis, has been arrested several times. In 1990, he was 
acquitted of assault with a deadly weapon in the near fatal 
shooting of a narcotics dealer in a Los Angeles drug den. 
</P>
<P>
	He once testified that he became depressed and turned to drugs  
after ``Diff'rent Strokes'' was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Coleman, who played the lovable Arnold on the show, pleaded  
no contest in February to disturbing the peace for punching an 
autograph-seeker in the eye. He was ordered to attend anger 
management classes, fined and given a suspended jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato has a 14-year-old son, Tyler Lambert of Tulsa, from a  
previous marriage.

<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Police in riot gear fired tear gas to  
disperse bottle-throwing students and arrested 77 people during an 
annual celebration for the end of classes at the University of 
Akron. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 students filled streets near campus late Friday  
and early Saturday and some threw bottles at 150 police officers

firefighters put out the flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they arrested 71 adults and six juveniles, mostly  
for disorderly conduct and underage drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrations in the past two years have been more subdued  
because of rain. The weather Friday night and early Saturday was

<HEADLINE> Bone Strength Lingers in Late Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Better bones built during youth can be saved  
for a later day, a study says. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding could help today's young exercisers amass a reserve  
of bone mineral that could reduce their risk of developing the weak 
bones that plague their grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regular exercise can be valuable for maximizing peak bone mass  
and thus contributing to prevention of osteoporosis and related 
fractures later in life,'' researchers in Finland reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The study of elite tennis players found that, even after the  
athletes cut back on their competition and decreased training, the 
bone density they had gained earlier remained. 
</P>
<P>
	That's important because bones are not as enduring as people  
think; like other parts of the body, they change. Physical activity 
stimulates them to lay down more calcium and become stronger. When 
they are deprived of physical activity, bones become weaker by 
losing calcium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finnish researchers looked at the playing arms of 13  
high-level competitive tennis players who had started their careers 
at an average age of 11. The scientists at the UKK Institute for 
Health Promotion Research measured the athletes' bone density in 
1992, when the players' average age was 26, and again four years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time of the last measurement, all had been out of  
national competition for an average of almost two years, four 
months. All had cut back their play from an average of 5.2 times a 
week to 2.6 times a week and their practices from an average of 7.6 
hours a week to 3.3 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial measurement found the bones of the playing arms had  
gained from 13 to 25 percent more mineral content than the bones in 
their opposite arms. This was the result of training at an early 
age, the researchers decided. 
</P>
<P>
	The later measurement found virtually no change in the  
proportion of bone mineral content in the players' arms, despite 
the men's reduced activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings support the idea that that the time to maximize  
bone density is in youth, when bones are growing anyway and are 
most responsive, the researchers said. Bones of adults are less 
responsive to exercise, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	It might well be that, during growth, the adaptations caused by  
exercise change bone structure permanently in such a way that even 
decreased activity cannot destroy the benefit, said the study in 
the American College of Sports Medicine journal, Medicine and 
Science in Sports and Exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	If other studies confirm this, ``regular exercise during the  
pubescent years should be recommended for maximizing the peak bone 
mass and eventually preventing osteoporosis and related 
fractures,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody once said osteoporosis should be considered a  
pediatric disease,'' commented Dr. Brian D. Golden, director of the 
Osteoporosis Center at the Hospital for Joint Diseases, New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Much research is done on slowing or preventing bone loss in  
adults, but ``studies like this speak to the earlier half of the 
equation,'' Golden said. It's important to gain as much bone as 
possible before the age of 30, when bone strength peaks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bone density built in youth can be a rainy day fund for when  
bones start to weaken, commented research physiologist Barbara L. 
Drinkwater of Pacific Medical Center, Seattle. ``There is this 
window of opportunity during adolescence,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But America doesn't seem interested in pushing the window open,  
Drinkwater said. ``Most schools in this country have done away with 
the physical activity requirement,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of school activity especially works against kids whose  
parents can't afford after-school activities such as tennis 
lessons, Drinkwater said. ``Public schools are the only place where 
every child has an opportunity to be physically active,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	How much exercise it takes is still an open question, said Scott  
Roberts, an assistant professor at Texas Tech University, Lubbock. 
But it may not take much -- even kids who play on playground 
equipment may be doing themselves some good, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bird-Watchers Flock to Lake Erie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAK HARBOR, Ohio (AP) -- Perched atop a leafless branch, a  
red-tailed hawk cries out. Its voice sends a shrill warning across 
the marsh. 
</P>
<P>
	In the air, another hawk circles just above a nest with  
uneasiness, signaling that we are too close. Not wanting to disturb 
them, we move on, the hawk's piercing cry still ringing in our 
ears. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the sound they use in the movies,'' says Christy Smith,  
a biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The hawks are among the 300 species of birds that can be spotted  
along Ohio's Lake Erie coast. Most of the birds pass through during 
the spring migration, stopping at the marshes and rocky shoreline 
to rest and refuel before flying north across the lake for the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The migration attracts thousands of bird-watchers toting  
expensive binoculars, spotting scopes and high-sensitivity tape 
recorders. They come from all states and around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird-watching is among the most popular activities in the  
nation, according to government surveys. About 60 million people 
say they are bird-watchers, ranging from the backyard variety to 
experts who keep detailed lists of every warbler and shorebird 
they've seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing about birding is that it's accessible to everyone,''  
says Peter Dunne, director of New Jersey Audubon Society's Cape May 
Bird Observatory. ``No matter where you are, there is a bird within 
100 feet of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It can be a treasure hunt and a way to escape from everyday  
concerns, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
	States are beginning to cash in on bird tourism, catering to the  
millions of birders who spend about $10 billion a year on hotels, 
campgrounds and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal regions that are stops on the spring and autumn  
migration trails are wildly popular. The Texas coast along the Gulf 
of Mexico and the Cape May peninsula in southern New Jersey each 
draw more than 100,000 birders a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's Everglades and southeast Arizona's Sulphur Springs  
Valley also are among the country's top birding sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Migrating birds long have been coming to northern Ohio because  
much of it was swampland more than 200 years ago. Although little 
of that remains, there are still more than 20 good bird-watching 
sites in the area between Toledo and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of them alone, Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge and the Magee  
Marsh Wildlife Area, have 20,000 acres of marshes, mud flats, 
ponds, grasslands and forests where birds can feast on fish, worms, 
mussels and plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're basically a bed-and-breakfast'' for the birds, Smith  
said. ``We try to provide everything they need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While both parks have walking paths and provide information for  
visitors, the Ottawa Wildlife Refuge's focus is on maintaining a 
safe and nurturing habitat for the birds. Access is limited to 
protect herons, egrets and shorebirds, which don't do well with 
humans around. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there are 10 miles of trails through the marshes and  
woodlands. The refuge also has five eagles' nests. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to get a good slice of what's going on,'' Smith  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some birds fly in from as far away as South America. They cross  
the Gulf of Mexico and then follow rivers northward until finding a 
place to mate and spend the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rivers are like highways for them,'' says Mark  
Shieldcastle, a wildlife biologist at Crane Creek. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the lake, the natural areas are as diverse and interesting  
as the birds for some. The walking trails through the marshes and 
woods are flat and meander past ponds. Deer, muskrats and rabbits 
often can be spotted along with eagles, and wildflowers add a 
splash of color in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly love just being out walking in the woods and marsh  
areas,'' says Mike Crofts, a bird-watcher for more than 25 years. 
``Learning about birds makes it more interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During migration, members of the Black Swamp Bird Observatory  
capture birds in nets and fit them with leg bands. Bruce Simpson of 
Delaware, Ohio, makes a four-hour round trip each week to help with 
the banding, which allows biologists to monitor habitat uses and 
migration patterns. They'll net and band up to 250 birds each day 
at the height of the migration. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the number of bird-watchers pales in comparison with  
their feathered friends, as many as 50,000 are expected to crowd 
the Lake Erie shore during May, adding up to $10 million to the 
area economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Many hotels offer discounts for bird-watchers, up to 20 percent  
off room rates, and gladly fill a thermos with coffee for early 
morning outings. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two of the passenger boat lines that serve the lake  
have added special birding excursions in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jet Express, which operates out of Port Clinton, shuttles  
birders to Point Pelee National Park in Canada and has birding 
experts on board during the 35-mile trip. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Some tips if you go bird-watching in northern Ohio:  
</P>
<P>
	GETTING THERE: The Ottawa Wildlife National Refuge and the Magee  
Marsh Wildlife Area are side-by-side along the Lake Erie shore. 
Toledo is 25 miles to the west, Cleveland 80 miles to the east. 
Interstate 75 and the Ohio Turnpike are within 20 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	BIRDING EVENTS: The Midwest Birding Symposium will be in  
Lakeside Sept. 16-19. The program will feature seminars with 
birding experts, field trips and a sale of bird-watchers' supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	THE WEATHER: Be sure to bring a raincoat and an extra sweater.  
April and May can be unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
	GEAR: Bring binoculars. An expensive pair isn't necessary to  
notice each bird's unique colors and markings. 
</P>
<P>
	CLOTHING: Wear comfortable clothes and shoes. Include a rain  
jacket and hat.

<HEADLINE> President Sends Regrets to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton sent a message of regret  
Sunday to Chinese President Jiang Zemin, explaining the bombing of 
the Chinese embassy in Belgrade as ``an unfortunate mistake,'' the 
White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also spoke by telephone Sunday with French President  
Jacques Chirac to discuss the NATO mission in Yugoslavia and 
diplomatic efforts with Russia, said national security spokesman 
David Leavy. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavy said Clinton sent a message to Jiang ``expressing regret  
on behalf of the American people for the tragic accident, 
explaining that it was not intentional, it was an unfortunate 
mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Clinton's letter ``also made clear the importance of  
guaranteeing the safety of our personnel and the protection of the 
(U.S.) embassy staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 20-minute call to Chirac, both leaders agreed ``that  
accidents like this are inevitable,'' Leavy said. ``Both leaders 
agree that the air campaign has to continue, that the alliance will 
remain united and continue to prosecute the air campaign until 
NATO's conditions are met.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Chirac also discussed the diplomatic dialogue with  
Russia, and agreed it is necessary to continue to engaging Russia 
and other European nations on ``the requirements to end NATO's 
bombing and give the Kosovars the security and dignity they 
deserve,'' Leavy said.

<HEADLINE> Dog Helps Woman Cope With Panic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CATONSVILLE, Md. (AP) -- The smell of a cigarette. The sound of  
footsteps behind her. Little things like these can trigger Lisa 
Conti's panic attacks and return her to the night she was raped. 
</P>
<P>
	She remembers the day in 1987 when, as an Army private in South  
Korea, she was jumped from behind, dragged into a car and driven to 
a place where she was raped by four men and tortured with lit 
cigarettes. She begins sweating and can't breathe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could be sitting at home, all by myself, and I could have  
one,'' Ms. Conti said, sitting on her living room couch, her arm 
tucked around her dog, King, her fingers stroking his black fur. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Conti rescued King from an animal shelter in May 1994 on the  
day he was to be euthanized. Little did she know he would end up 
saving her. 
</P>
<P>
	``King is my lifeline to the world,'' Ms. Conti said.  
</P>
<P>
	King, a 6-year-old spaniel mix, is a registered service dog. He  
senses when Ms. Conti is going to have a panic attack and sometimes 
can help prevent them. 
</P>
<P>
	Guide dogs for the blind have been around for 80 years, but  
using dogs for ``invisible disabilities'' is relatively new. Dogs 
now are being trained to help people with such problems as 
depression, bipolar disorder and agoraphobia, said Susan Duncan, 
manager of the service dog center at Delta Society, a nonprofit 
group in Renton, Wash., that promotes the health benefits of 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows for sure how King senses when Ms. Conti is about to  
have a panic attack. He may be responding to changes in scent 
caused by changes in body chemistry, Ms. Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Training will reinforce what the dogs will want to do naturally  
when their owners are distressed: lean against their owners, nuzzle 
them and stand between them and a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I would have a panic attack, he would come up and put his  
body against me,'' Ms. Conti said. ``It helped keep me out of what 
was happening inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Stephens, of Norman, Okla., isn't sure how Chief, his  
German shepherd mix, knows when he's about to have a panic attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens' doctor prescribed a service dog to help with  
post-traumatic stress from serving in Vietnam. Chief proved 
invaluable one winter day while Stephens was driving over an icy 
pass between Laramie and Cheyenne, Wyo.

	``All of a sudden Chief, who was in back of the station wagon,  
began whining and nuzzling my neck,'' Stephens said. ``Then 
something popped into my head. `This dog knows something I don't.' 
No sooner had I pulled to the side of the road and gotten that car 
in park, I had a full-blown panic attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens relies on Chief to alert him to take his anti-anxiety  
drug before he has an attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I don't have meds, he gets me through it by just sitting  
there nuzzling,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, people with physical  
and mental impairments that ``substantially limit one or more major 
life activities'' can have a trained service dog with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the law, Ms. Conti says she has a hard time getting  
people to understand that King is entitled to go where she goes. 
</P>
<P>
	Shari Sternberger, founder of National Capital Therapy Dogs in  
Highland, Md., says taking away a mentally disabled person's 
service dog is equivalent to removing glasses from a near-sighted 
person or a cane from someone with a limp. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dog is considered ... a medical appliance, nothing more or  
nothing less. That appliance allows her to function in life,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Conti has been turned away from restaurants, shops, even the  
Baltimore Orioles ballpark. Recently, she got a photo 
identification card for King from the Department of Veterans 
Affairs that she hopes will help people understand her disability. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Ms. Conti was discharged from the Army on April 21,  
1989, her psychological problems were overwhelming. Over the next 
six years, she was hospitalized more than 100 times. She was too 
fearful to walk to the end of her driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John Butchart, a staff psychologist at the Veterans  
Administration Hospital in Baltimore, thought a companion dog would 
be good for her. He had no idea the dog would be critical to her 
feeling of well-being. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before she got this animal she was extremely timid, very  
retiring, almost agoraphobic,'' he said. ``Now she is different. 
... She has become much more assertive, far more confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Ms. Conti is having a nightmare, King will come and lick her  
hand until she wakes up. If a panic attack occurs when she is 
attending class at the local community college, King will steer her 
toward a quiet corner and stay with her until her terror subsides. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't understand that you are frozen. You can't move,  
you're shaking and you're sweating, but there is nothing going on 
around you. He leads me away,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Conti, who was last hospitalized in 1996, takes no  
psychiatric medication. She holds a job and is going to college to 
become a park ranger. Although she has two or three panic attacks a 
month, she says they are tolerable, thanks to King.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Up in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices rose in early trading Monday  
amid hopes for fresh measures by the Japanese government to 
stimulate the economy. The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 113.89 points,  
or 0.67 percent, to 17,060.41 points in the first 30 minutes of 
trading. On Friday, the average lost 354.09 points, or 2.05 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was traded at 120.94 yen, up 0.40 yen from late in  
Tokyo on Friday and also above its late New York level of 120.85 
yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock exchange, share prices jumped following comments  
Sunday by Japan's chief economic planner, Taichi Sakaiya, that an 
extra budget to spur economic growth was ``possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were also boosted by strong gains Friday on Wall Street.  
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 84.77 points 
to 11,031.59, marking yet another record close. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 7.28 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,375.70. The 
TOPIX closed down 12.70 points, or 0.92 percent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar rose on U.S. employment data  
released last week that showed job growth remained strong in 
America despite a slight rise in unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 129.55 yen, down  
from 130.22 yen late Friday in Tokyo. The euro fell on news of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's mistaken bombing of the 
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.335 percent from 1.315 percent Friday, driving it's 
price down to 104.13 yen from 104.32 yen.

<HEADLINE> White House Opens Violence Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton intends to avoid making the  
gun and entertainment industries scapegoats for youth violence at a 
White House brainstorming session, aides say, but both complain 
they've already been targeted for blame. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton summoned young people, parents, religious leaders and  
representatives of the two industries to talk today about the root 
causes of violence that repeatedly erupts in the nation's schools, 
most recently and most deadly in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association, uncompromising critic of gun  
control laws, was not invited. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials hope the session -- which was drawing about  
50 participants ranging from America Online's chief executive to 
poet Maya Angelou -- will provide the groundwork for a national 
campaign on reducing youth violence, much like similar campaigns to 
curb teen-age pregnancy and to find jobs for former welfare 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's time for all sectors of society to step up to  
the plate and take responsibility,'' said Clinton domestic policy 
adviser Bruce Reed. ``We're not interested in pointing fingers. We 
want to find solutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But gun advocates and participants from the entertainment  
industry say they are feeling more pressure than most, because of 
the newly intensified debate over the availability of weapons and 
whether violence among teen-agers is fomented by the images and 
language in movies, video games and song lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of two gun-manufacturing groups -- the National Shooting  
Sports Foundation and the American Shooting Sports Council -- met 
with Reed last week on Clinton's anti-violence plan and planned to 
attend today's gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	They left open the possibility of endorsing some of the  
administration's proposals to keep guns out of the hands of young 
people, although they said they wanted to see the details first. 
One measure would raise the age at which a person can buy a handgun 
from 18 to 21. Another would hold parents criminally responsible 
for making guns accessible to children. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed said the White House would work with the groups to find  
common ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA, meanwhile, called a news conference today to unveil its  
own proposals to make ``an immediate and significant impact'' on 
violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre said Clinton  
administration officials should resist a knee-jerk urge to explore 
more restrictive gun laws and instead push for better enforcement 
of those already on the books. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have presided over a complete and total collapse of  
prosecution of laws,'' LaPierre said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the 
Press.'' ``We have mandatory sentences for felons caught with guns. 
We have mandatory sentences for people carrying guns and selling 
drugs in the street. We don't enforce any of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of  
America, said the film industry shouldn't be singled out for blame. 
He said he supports having the U.S. surgeon general do an in-depth 
analysis of ``the why of violence'' to better understand all of the 
factors at play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I also believe that church and home and school are the three  
places where children learn what is right and what is wrong, and 
that's where they build a strong moral shield,'' Valenti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Valenti, entertainment industry representatives expected  
at today's meeting were the heads of the Recording Industry 
Association of America, the National Association of Broadcasters, 
the National Cable Television Association and the Interactive 
Digital Software Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative activist Gary Bauer, a candidate for the Republican  
presidential nomination, said the issue revolves more around the 
ability to teach values in school than on the images presented to 
young people. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the two student gunmen in Littleton who shot 12  
classmates and a teacher to death before killing themselves ``came 
to school giving the Nazi salute, produced a video showing them 
killing other students'' and posted an Internet ``Web site dripping 
with hate,'' but somehow managed to evade the scrutiny of school 
officials and other adults. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's at the heart of this issue, and basically not Hollywood  
and not guns,'' Bauer said. ``Eighteen gun laws were violated that 
day in Littleton, Colorado. I don't think anyone believes a 19th or 
20th is going to stop the tragedies that we are seeing.''

<HEADLINE> Hatfield-McCoy Feud Draws Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PIKEVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Bo McCoy is the real McCoy, the  
great-great-grandson of Randoph McCoy, whose feud with the 
Hatfields dating back to the 1870s made both clans famous. 
</P>
<P>
	Bo is looking to pit the McCoys against the Hatfields again, but  
this time on the softball diamond. 
</P>
<P>
	Bo and second cousin Ron McCoy are planning a family reunion in  
June next year in Pikeville, site of the legendary Appalachian 
feud. Even the Hatfields are invited. 
</P>
<P>
	The reunion is called M2K for ``McCoys 2000.'' Already, the  
reunion's Web site has received more than 14,000 hits. The McCoys 
are selling T-shirts. About 500 to 1,000 people are expected to 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``The legend and myth of the feud is there, but the truth about  
what really happened is fading,'' Ron McCoy said. ``Part of our 
vision here is to bring the reality of the feud back into the 
forefront.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The feud itself took place during most of 1870s and 1880s and  
resulted in the deaths of 12 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the McCoy cousins, Ron Eller, director of the Appalachian  
Center at the University of Kentucky, said the feud is widely 
misunderstood -- primarily because of exaggerated media accounts 
that many say created negative stereotypes of Appalachia that still 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than being poor hillbillies, in reality both the McCoys  
and the Hatfields were prominent families living along the 
Kentucky-West Virginia border. And their battle wasn't a mere feud 
arising from a dispute over a pig, as some storytellers have 
recalled, but was instead a severe local economic struggle over 
resources such as timber, Eller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Randolph McCoy lost five sons as a result of the feud and a  
daughter, Roseanna, to measles during that time. In contrast, 
Hatfield family patriarch ``Devil Anse'' Hatfield didn't lose any 
of his children and went on to live a prosperous life, Ron McCoy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hatfields suffered losses, including the 1882 death of  
Ellison Hatfield on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Both McCoys set out on a personal quest to learn about their  
family's past. Along they way, they met over the Internet and began 
planning the reunion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want future generations to look back at the Hatfield  
and McCoy feud and laugh at it,'' Bo McCoy said. ``It's a tragedy 
that should never have happened, but these people fought and died 
for what they believed in, and they were our family members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes according to plan, the McCoys will take on the  
Hatfields in a softball tournament. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Noted MD Denies Sex Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A noted epidemiologist who left his posts at  
Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital in March 
resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment, according to a 
published report. 
</P>
<P>
	The physician denied the claims.  
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe on Sunday reported allegations that Dr. Charles  
H. Hennekens harassed more than a dozen women over several years, 
basing its report on three unidentified sources who worked with 
Hennekens at the hospital's Division of Preventive Medicine,. 
</P>
<P>
	Hennekens, 56, criticized the Globe for relying on anonymous  
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``In today's world, allegations of sexual harassment are easily  
made and difficult to disprove. When they are made by people who 
are unwilling to be identified, they are not worthy of response, 
much less publication,'' Hennekens said in a statement issued by 
his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the Globe has chosen to publish anonymous allegations, I  
will state only that I have never in my life sexually harassed 
anyone in the division or anywhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hennekens led the landmark study that found taking an aspirin a  
day cuts the risk of some kinds of heart attacks. He also is noted 
for leading studies that found birth control pills don't raise the 
risk of heart attacks and that low-fat diets don't prevent breast 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	When he resigned in March, he cited ``personal and family  
illness'' and his lawyer, Joel Kozol, said Hennekens wanted to move 
to Florida to be with his ailing mother. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Brigham and Women's spokeswoman Christine Baratta and  
Harvard spokesman Bill Shaller declined to comment on the reason 
for Hennekens' departure, citing ``issues of employee 
confidentiality.'' Hennekens' lawyer did not immediately return 
phone messages.

<HEADLINE> Town Too Nice for Telemarketers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FROSTBURG, Md. (AP) -- Judy Blackburn has nothing but good things  
to say about her job at Unitel Corp. ``I LOVE working here. I LOVE 
this place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But only as long as her employer doesn't send her back to making  
cold calls as a telemarketer, with pitches for long-distance 
telephone service or overnight package deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	Since January, she's been taking calls instead, from folks with  
questions about retirement accounts. She's in Customer Service, and 
for Blackburn, in a much better job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had people tell me I ruined their day by calling them, that  
I should be ashamed of myself,'' she says of her earlier task. 
</P>
<P>
	Not very nice. Not the kind of person you'll likely meet in  
Frostburg, if you believe Blackburn's employer. 
</P>
<P>
	Unitel says modest, accommodating people outnumber brash,  
assertive people by such a wide margin in this Appalachian town of 
8,100 that it can only fill 100 sales jobs here. 
</P>
<P>
	So the telemarketing firm based in Virginia is turning the bulk  
of its 400 positions in Frostburg toward customer service and 
concentrating its sales work in a calling center opening later in 
May in Lakeland, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	There, by tapping a population of more than 200,000 between  
Tampa and Orlando, Unitel President Douglas Palley is sure he'll 
find more people able to do the grunt work of telemarketing. 
</P>
<P>
	The meat-eaters, he calls them. The Type A's.  
</P>
<P>
	``Type A is where, if you're at a party, they'll walk up to you  
and say `My name is whatever.' Type B is the type that sits there 
and waits for someone to come over,'' Palley says. ``I think, in 
the general population, the minority of people are Type A 
personalities, and those are the types of people you need to make 
100 phone calls a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Carmichael, a vice president at Unitel, says most of the  
company's Frostburg team isn't the ``assertive, aggressive sort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Mayor John Bambacus insists, in words for which he later  
apologized, ``Frostburg is not the Bronx.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not by a long shot. It's part old coal-mining town and part  
modern college town, near the Eastern Continental Divide. It's 10 
miles from West Virginia and 150 miles from Baltimore, tucked among 
the peaks of Maryland's mountainous western panhandle. 
</P>
<P>
	Allegany County's unemployment is high -- 9.7 percent in  
February, more than double the state and national rates. But so is 
worker absenteeism during deer-hunting season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a laid-back community. We take things a little  
slower,'' says the mayor, also a professor of political science at 
Frostburg State University, as he drives his Dodge pickup along 
Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Princess Restaurant hasn't changed much in 60 years: A  
plaque above one yellow Formica table marks the booth where Harry 
and Bess Truman ate in 1953. Movie tickets at the Palace Theater 
are $5, all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Parking tickets -- rarely issued -- carry a $1 fine. The most  
alarming crimes that the 14-member police force investigated last 
year included the theft of the town Christmas tree from a lot 
between City Hall and the First Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Race, a former bank president and current raconteur, likes  
it this way. The area's character, he says, was shaped by pious 
German farmers and immigrants from Italy and the British Isles who 
came to mine coal in the hills covered with hardwoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors pull together during crises, like the tornado that  
leveled 29 homes last year, but otherwise they tend to be reserved 
and clannish. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Italians didn't get along with the Irish,'' Race notes.  
``The Scots all went to the Presbyterian church and had little or 
no use for the Roman Catholic church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he loves his town enough to have spent most of his 91  
years here, he cautions against concluding its citizens are 
exceptionally nice, just because they don't like making sales 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe they're too lazy,'' he snorts. ``Have you thought of  
that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bambacus says Frostburg takes pride in its neighborliness. But  
so does the Bronx, adds borough spokesman Clint Roswell. ``The pace 
might be a little faster living in a city,'' he says, ``but I can't 
see it having an effect on people being assertive or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And what's wrong with assertiveness, asks Lakeland Mayor Buddy  
Fletcher, a developer of strip malls and office buildings. 
``Assertive is always good in whatever we do in the sales field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Would he like to be a telemarketer?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more of a people person,'' Fletcher says.  
</P>
<P>
	So is Charlotte Biggs of Frostburg. This 35-year-old divorced  
mother likes her customer service job at Unitel, but she hates 
making sales pitches. ``I don't like them calling me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who does? Even Betty Williams, a retired receptionist who has  
lived in the Frostburg area for all her 71 years, cuts off 
telemarketers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they start talking, I say, `I'm not interested, thank  
you,' and hang up,'' she admits, during a lunchtime chat at the 
Princess Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Her pal Betty Kahl, retired postmistress, treats telemarketers  
more gently. When they call, she listens. After all, it might be 
her neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	The one who works at Unitel.

<HEADLINE> CBS, Mitsubishi Ink HDTV Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The majority of CBS' prime-time lineup this fall  
will available in the new HDTV format as the media company 
continues to make further commitments to digital broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Digital Electronics America Inc. will exclusively  
sponsor the programs, CBS Corp. said Saturday. CBS did not identify 
which programs would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	HDTV, or high-definition television, provides viewers with much  
sharper images than are available through regular analog 
televisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Special sets and tuners costing thousands of dollars is needed  
to pick up the digital transmissions, however. Only about 60 of the 
nation's 1,500 television stations now offer HDTV programming or 
have applied for a permit, further limiting the appeal for 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators now require stations in the 10 largest U.S.  
cities to send digital signals. This fall, another 20 cities will 
face that requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, MDEA television dealers will be able to  
advertise across all of CBS' media platforms, including television 
stations, Infinity Broadcasting radio stations and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The increase in HDTV programming resulting from this  
sponsorship will further assure consumers who have purchased HDTV 
products that they have made a wise investment and can begin 
enjoying a greater number of programs,'' said Max Wasinger, vice 
president in sales and marketing for MDEA. 
</P>
<P>
	By Nov. 1, CBS expects to be transmitting digital programming  
across more than 40 stations, reaching more than 50 percent of the 
United States. Currently only 14 CBS-owned and affiliated stations 
have the capability.

<HEADLINE> Faulty Pump, Seal Blamed in Sinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- Investigators examining the raised  
wreckage of a tourist boat said Sunday that an out-of-place seal 
and a bilge pump hose that separated apparently caused the vessel 
to sink suddenly, killing 13 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Glenn Anderson, who heads the Coast Guard's effort to  
determine how the May 1 accident occurred, said a seal on the drive 
shaft was pushed forward by 3 inches, opening a hole in the bottom 
of the boat. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said, water that was filling the hull was not  
pumped out of the craft because of the bilge-pump hose had 
separated. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of details all go wrong together for a casualty (total)  
like this,'' Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Navy salvage team using a crane raised the amphibious craft  
Sunday from where it had rested on the bottom of Lake Hamilton, 50 
to 60 feet below. A formal marine board inquiry begins Monday, 
according to Coast Guard spokeswoman Allison van Hagen. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll have a better idea of what to ask'' now that  
investigators have had a look at the hull of the craft, van Hagen 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The boat took on water and sank about seven minutes after  
setting out from shore with 20 tourists and its driver aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, boat driver Elizabeth Helmbrecht told officials she  
had taken the vessel in for repairs two days before the accident, 
because a seal around a drive shaft was leaking. The fatal trip was 
the first for the boat since that visit to the repair shop, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Helmbrecht, and the Land and Lake Tours Inc., which operated the  
boat, were named as defendants Friday in a wrongful-death lawsuit 
filed in federal court by the husband and son of one of the 13 
victims, Lana Jo Berry, 42, of Dyersburg, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Hagen said the boat would be taken to a National Guard  
armory for a more complete inspection.

<HEADLINE> Questions Loom As Farmers Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TROY, Ohio (AP) -- Work beckons in the fields, the tractor needs  
a new clutch and the barn and outbuildings could use a fresh coat 
of paint. 
</P>
<P>
	Woody McDowell slumps on a stool inside the barn to catch his  
breath. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get awfully tired,'' said the 80-year-old farmer. ``It takes  
me longer to do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the barn creaks in the wind, McDowell watches a friend work  
on his tractor. McDowell's cheek bulges with a plug of tobacco, and 
he pauses to spit from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been farming his 129-acre spread in west-central Ohio  
since 1953 and also works about 1,000 acres of nearby farmland. But 
age is catching up with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``This winter, my wife and I both really slowed down,'' said  
McDowell. ``I hope we can make it through this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's farmers, on average, are aging.  
</P>
<P>
	According to the Agriculture Department, the average age of an  
American farm operator in 1997 was 54.3 years, up from 53.3 years 
in 1992 and 50.5 years in 1982. In Ohio, the average age also 
increased by a year from 1992 to 1997, to 53.1 years. 
</P>
<P>
	That rise is connected to the question of what happens when a  
farmer retires or dies. Unless heirs protect the farm or another 
farmer takes it over, it may fall into the hands of developers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. farmland shrank from 945 million acres in 1992 to 931  
million in 1997. In Ohio, it went from 11.5 million acres to 11.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who's going to farm the ground? Is there going to be anything  
left from this urban sprawl?'' McDowell asked. ``They're going to 
have to do something because the backbone of the United States 
started with agriculture, and it's still the backbone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calvin Beale, senior demographer with USDA's Economic Research  
Service, said fewer farm families have children who are interested 
in farming in part because of financial hurdles and also because 
the families are smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Pullins, vice president of business services for the Ohio  
Farm Bureau, said it can be challenging to attract young people to 
farming because it takes money to get into it and can take time to 
make money in the business. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't go into farming with a lunchbox,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Pullins said, young people have many opportunities  
in other industries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those farm kids who are raised and have a strong work ethic  
are recruited by many others,'' he said. ``It's a matter of 
competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts have been made to preserve farmland by trying to  
establish links between farmers and buyers. But the programs, 
designed to match young people interested in farming with older 
farmers who have no heirs, have had spotty success, Pullins said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said older farmers can be reluctant to turn over control,  
especially if the chemistry isn't right. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard enough when people are related,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	McDowell said that while he doesn't expect any of his three  
grown children to work the farm after he's gone, they won't sell it 
to developers either. He expects they will arrange for someone else 
to farm the land. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they will have to withstand the pressures of urban  
sprawl. While sheep graze in a pasture sprinkled with spring's 
dandelions just across the road, modern, suburban-style houses have 
popped up on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	McDowell fears the nation will have to begin importing much of  
its food ``if we put blacktop over all of our prime farm ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They better be thinking about this,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Neeson Not Serious About Retiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Liam Neeson says he was exaggerating when he  
told an interviewer he had had enough of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting out. I'm retiring from movies next year,'' Neeson  
says in the June issue of Redbook magazine. ``Honest to God, I 
don't want to do it anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In interviews with reporters Sunday in New York, Neeson said he  
wasn't serious when he threatened to leave acting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something that came up from finishing a long period of  
work onstage and on film ... It's not true. I just was venting a 
bit of anger. I just was missing my family. And missing being on a 
trout stream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The star of ``Schindler's List,'' ``Nell,'' ``Rob Roy'' and  
``Michael Collins'' has a lead role in the year's most anticipated 
film, ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' But fame isn't 
enough.

<HEADLINE> Cal, Hunger Strikers Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Six protesters ended an eight-day hunger  
strike Saturday when the University of California, Berkeley, agreed 
to retain eight ethnic studies professorships. 
</P>
<P>
	The school also will provide $100,000 toward an institute of  
race and gender studies, open a multicultural student center and 
commission an ethnic studies mural. 
</P>
<P>
	Students began a liquid-only diet on April 30, claiming  
administrators had cut funding to the ethnic studies department. On 
Tuesday, police arrested some 80 protesters who had set up a 
makeshift camp outside the office of Chancellor Robert Berdahl. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the hunger strikers had to be treated for dehydration and  
an irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Berdahl said the agreement proves the university's commitment to  
its ethnic studies program.

 *Dana Plato    	
</P>
<P>
	MOORE, Okla. (AP) -- Actress Dana Plato, who like her fellow  
``Diff'rent Strokes'' child co-stars had seen legal troubles since 
the show was canceled, died Saturday of a drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato, 34, apparently took the painkiller Loritab along with  
Valium on Saturday while visiting the home of her fiance's parents. 
Police said the death appeared accidental and they did not suspect 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato played Kimberly Drummond on the NBC sitcom that ran  
from 1978 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	She was arrested in 1991 for robbing a Las Vegas video store,  
and was placed on five years' probation. In 1992 she was given an 
additional five years' probation for forging prescriptions for 
Valium. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I hadn't gotten caught, it could have been the worst thing  
that happened to me because I could have died of a drug overdose,'' 
she told reporters in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato and her fiance, Robert Menchaca, had stopped at his  
parents' home in Moore for Mother's Day. Ms. Plato and Menchaca, 
28, were en route to Los Angeles after she appeared on the Howard 
Stern's radio program in New York as part of an effort to 
jump-start her career. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Ms. Plato went to take a nap Saturday afternoon.  
After Menchaca realized that evening there was a problem, his 
mother, a nurse, and his brother tried unsuccessfully to revive her 
with cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato's recent career had included mainly low-budget films  
such as 1992's ``Bikini Beach Race'' and the 1997 film ``Different 
Strokes: A Story of Jack and Jill ... and Jill,'' a direct-to-video 
softcore tale about a sexual threesome.

<HEADLINE> ACLU Targets Nervous School Heads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Eleven students are suspended for putting a  
satirical essay on their personal Web site. A teen-ager is sent to 
the police station for wearing black clothing. A student is 
interrogated about the chemistry book he's carrying. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the nation, American Civil Liberties Union offices say  
they're being swamped by complaints that nervous school officials 
are trampling students' constitutional rights since the April 20 
shootings in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to have become a witch hunt. I'm sure we've gotten  
hundreds of phone calls,'' said Ann Beeson, a staff attorney at the 
ACLU's national headquarters in New York. ``Most school officials 
are not aware or not focusing on the fact that students are 
citizens, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Daniels of the ACLU in Ohio said the most serious of more  
than two dozen complaints to his office involved 11 students from 
Brimfield, a small town about 30 miles southeast of Cleveland. The 
students had a Web site for the Gothic subculture of youths who 
wear black, listen to rocker Marilyn Manson and think a lot about 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Colorado gunmen embraced some Goth trappings but also  
exhibited racist attitudes and violence that most in the Goth world 
reject. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site, filled with images of dragons and castles and dark  
poetry, had been created months before the Littleton shootings but 
was updated with comment on the massacre. The students called 
gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold fellow ``freaks'' and 
sarcastically praised them. 
</P>
<P>
	One statement read: ``I wonder how long it'll be before we're  
allowed to wear our trenchcoats anymore. You know those screwed up 
kids in Colorado were wearing them, so that means I will also kill 
someone, and so will all my friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Timm Mackley, the school district's superintendent, said the Web  
site was obscene and had a threatening tone. He suspended the 
students, but the ACLU successfully fought their expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The students were engaging in protected speech, off campus,''  
Daniels said. ``The school says they can punish them for that type 
of speech and behavior. What's next? Regulating conversations off 
campus?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A consultant on school security cautioned that while there may  
be some overreaction, heightened awareness now may be uncovering 
real threats that predate Littleton, as well as ``spinoff-type 
incidents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We keep getting asked the question, `Is Littleton a wake-up  
call?' My question is, are we going to hit the snooze button and go 
to sleep?'' said Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety 
and Security Services in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Firm, fair and consistent enforcement of school rules and the  
law'' is the only recourse for school administrators, Trump said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	ACLU officials said most of the complaints they're hearing deal  
with teens getting in trouble for wearing trenchcoats or dressing 
in black. Some other cases: 
</P>
<P>
	-- A 13-year-old Arizona boy was given in-school detention for  
carrying an electronics magazine with ads for guns. The boy was 
arrested when he drew a cartoon showing the school blowing up. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A 14-year-old Pennsylvania girl was suspended for telling a  
teacher in a class conversation on the Littleton shootings that she 
could understand how someone who is teased endlessly could snap. 
</P>
<P>
	-- An Illinois student was questioned by a psychiatrist for 1 1/2  
hours about the video games he plays and asked if he ever looks for 
bomb-making instructions on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really scares me. Anybody who doesn't fit into a specific  
category or dresses differently or is considered a nerd or a geek, 
all of a sudden they're a suspect. The students are losing their 
constitutional rights,'' said Andy Brumme, staff counsel for the 
ACLU in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Brumme represented a 17-year-old North Augusta, S.C., student  
who was suspended for criticizing his principal and ROTC teachers 
at Midland Valley High School. On his personal Web page, he told 
ROTC teachers to ``eat feces and die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School administrators had talked to the teen about the Web site  
before but didn't take action until after the Colorado shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ludicrous to think that's a threat,'' Brumme said.  
``People are reacting instead of thinking.'' Brumme said the 
student had a good case but agreed to remove the criticism and 
apologize so he could graduate and go on to college this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Brumme said he was considering filing a complaint after police  
searched three suburban Columbia high school students who were sent 
to the principal's office for wearing all black. He said one of the 
students was asked why he was carrying a chemistry book. 
</P>
<P>
	``Schools are saying that school safety comes first and  
students' rights second. That's wrong,'' said Eleanor Eisenberg, 
executive director of the ACLU in Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Oscar-Winner Dench Up for Tony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Judi Dench may be headed for a rare double.  
</P>
<P>
	The recent Academy Award winner for ``Shakespeare in Love'' is  
up for a Tony thanks to her work on Broadway in the play ``Amy's 
View.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very dreamlike,'' Dench, 64, says in Sunday's Daily News.  
``I'm like the cartoon character that runs off the cliff,'' and 
hangs suspended in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	A top actress in England for decades, Dench gained attention in  
America playing Queen Victoria in ``Mrs. Brown'' before her 
Oscar-winning turn in ``Shakespeare in Love'' as Queen Elizabeth. 
Her other film credits include two James Bond films ``GoldenEye'' 
and ``Tomorrow Never Dies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She co-stars in ``Tea With Mussolini,'' a film by Franco  
Zeffirelli opening Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Amy's View,'' she plays an actress coming to grips with old  
age. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout your life, you get wiser. You get more  
economical,'' Dench said. ``It isn't the most you do, it's the less 
you do that's most important.''

<HEADLINE> No Timetable Set in Rebuilding Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf, whose  
team is headed for the draft lottery instead of defending its 
championship, isn't sure how long it will take to produce a winner 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shorter the better. But you can't set a timetable. We just  
have to make progress every year,'' Reinsdorf said Sunday before 
the other team he runs, the Chicago White Sox, played the Oakland 
Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls just completed a miserable season, going 13-37 after  
breaking up their dynasty. It was a season full of lopsided losses 
and embarrassing records for futility, such as scoring 49 points in 
one game and losing by 47 points in another. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a done deal now and the challenge is to rebuild it and  
get it back to where it was,'' Reinsdorf said. The draft lottery is 
May 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan recently broke off negotiations to buy the  
Charlotte Hornets because he wanted more control than owner George 
Shinn was willing to give. Reinsdorf seemed to think the deal could 
be revived. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can assume that the deal is done unless  
Shinn makes a deal with somebody else. ... It can come back to life 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White Sox chopped their payroll to $24 million this season  
after letting Albert Belle and Robin Ventura go. They are stressing 
a youth movement after drawing just 1.39 million fans last year and 
have gotten off to a good start, two games over .500 before 
Sunday's play. Still, crowds have been small and in 12 home dates 
before Sunday, the White Sox were averaging 12,541. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our TV ratings have definitely gone up. Ticket sales are  
picking up,'' Reinsdorf said. ``If we play well and once the 
weather gets nice, people will come out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't pay attention to it. I just come out. I'm not worried  
about it. If we continue to play well into the future, we will be 
OK.''

<HEADLINE> 23 Die in Bus Crash in Louisiana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A chartered bus carrying members of a seniors  
casino club on a Mother's Day gambling excursion swerved off a 
highway, careened down an embankment, then crashed up a grassy 
slope Sunday morning, killing 23 people, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen more were hospitalized, nine in critical or guarded  
condition. Three people were released after emergency room 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Marc Morial said it was the worst traffic accident in city  
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies were not all removed until the afternoon, four hours  
after the crash. ``We have people on top of each other, crushed 
between twisted metal,'' police Officer Joe Narcisse said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus, traveling eastbound on Interstate 610, swerved from the  
left lane off of the highway, then across a narrow paved narrow 
path for golf carts that emerges from a tunnel next to the highway, 
crashing down one embankment and up the other. 
</P>
<P>
	It came to rest on a flat grassy area along the highway, where  
it passes through one of the city's biggest parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrell Walker, safety director for Custom Bus Charters, which  
chartered the bus for the trip to Casino Magic in Bay St. Louis, 
Miss., said the driver told him the bus swerved when it was cut off 
by another car. The bus originated in La Place, La., 26 miles west 
of New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness told the same story. Linda Watkins said she was  
driving behind the bus when a white car swerved in front and the 
bus changed lanes. Then the white car swerved back in front of the 
bus, which ran off the road and crashed up the embankment. 
</P>
<P>
	``People started flying out of the bus, flying out the  
windows,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the accident happened shortly before 9 a.m. as  
the bus was headed for a casino on Mississippi's Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker said 46 people were on the bus, but the list of  
passengers was lost in the wreckage. Those aboard included members 
of an informal gambling club, many of them elderly, some in their 
80s. 
</P>
<P>
	Four more people had been waiting to board the bus in New  
Orleans, including Charlene Schexnider, who has traveled with the 
group for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider everybody on the bus my friend,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The front of the bus was so crumpled that its front wheels were  
two feet off the ground. Rescue squads had to brace the bus with 
timbers and use ladders to reach its windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine people were taken to Medical Center of Louisiana, all in  
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Others were taken to Tulane Medical Center, Methodist Hospital  
and Memorial Medical Center's Mercy campus, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The people on the bus were members of a club who go to the  
casino twice a month, according to George Tassin, who said eight 
members of his family, mostly women on a Mother's Day trip, were on 
the bus. 
</P>
<P>
	Tassin's wife, daughter and an aunt were among the injured, he  
said as he waited outside the hospital where they were taken. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his aunt was making her first trip since the recent  
death of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``My aunt finally decided to go this one time and this  
happened,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four gambling charter buses crashed in New Jersey en route to  
Atlantic City in late December and early January. One crash on 
Christmas Eve killed eight people and injured 15 others.

<HEADLINE> Sex Criminal Treatment Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATASCADERO, Calif. (AP) -- Each room holds a single bed. There  
are some potted plants, and walls papered with glossy pictures 
ripped from magazines, mostly of sports cars and scantily clad 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	At first glance, it could be a college dorm. But the tiny, beige  
rooms at Atascadero State Hospital have barred windows and doors 
that lock from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucked among rolling hills and a dozen wineries midway between  
Los Angeles and San Francisco, Atascadero is the institution 
California has chosen for its experiment in easing society's 
frustration with sex criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than set the rapists and child molesters free after they  
serve their sentences, the state locks up the worst of them inside 
this mental hospital for at least two more years, extendable if a 
judge or jury so decide. 
</P>
<P>
	When the law was passed in 1995, critics said it was tantamount  
to allowing indefinite detention. But the California Supreme Court 
ruled in January that it does not violate criminals' rights. The 
U.S. Supreme Court also has found that such programs, now in place 
in 14 states, are constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	But these rulings haven't settled the debate between supporters  
of the system, and those who think it smacks of locking 'em up and 
throwing away the key. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a misuse of psychiatry,'' said Dr. Howard Zonana, a Yale  
University psychiatry professor who studied the issue for five 
years for the American Psychiatric Association. 
</P>
<P>
	It's tantamount to ``lifelong preventive confinement after  
prison,'' he said. ``Once they get in, it's very hard to get out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But psychologist Dale Arnold and others at Atascadero are proud  
of the work they do with sexually violent predators, or SVPs in the 
professional terminology. 
</P>
<P>
	They teach them how to feel empathy for their victims. They help  
them cope with situations that could lead them to commit new 
crimes. They use drugs and behavior modification methods. Mostly, 
the doctors say, they teach their patients to think differently -- 
to take more responsibility for their actions and stop 
rationalizing their sexual deviance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We teach there's no cure for sex offenders, there's just risk  
management,'' said Arnold, who has worked with SVPs at Atascadero 
for 1 1/2 years. ``It's nice to see someone who has a problem say they 
need help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But does the treatment work? Is it possible to prevent a violent  
sex criminal from striking again? The experts themselves aren't 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Taylor, a Sacramento-area deputy district attorney who  
has had two SVPs committed to Atascadero, sees little choice. ``We 
don't have to let mad dogs run the streets,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law is the instrument for getting them into the hospital, he  
said. ``Most aren't going to stay there forever. It's a chance to 
maybe get recidivism numbers down a bit. They normally respond to 
years of treatment if you work on them long enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Jean Matulis, a Monterey County lawyer who represents  
several rapists at Atascadero, says many of her clients who deserve 
another chance are losing hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of these people have made mistakes, they've served their  
time and they're not being given a second chance,'' she said. ``A 
lot of people wouldn't be unhappy if they were locked up forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press was recently allowed a rare visit to  
Atascadero to talk with seven of the ex-convicts in the company of 
administrative staff and clinicians. The state picked the seven. 
Others who were not invited contacted the AP by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital administrator Craig Nelson had the invited patients  
sign consent forms specifying whether their names and photos could 
be used. None agreed to be named, though several were willing to be 
photographed. 
</P>
<P>
	Most were middle-aged and looked as normal as your next-door  
neighbor. But like all those who are considered for the program, 
they had been convicted of violent sexual attacks on at least two 
victims. And chances are high they will attack again without 
intensive therapy, according to Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	They attend group counseling sessions similar to Alcoholics  
Anonymous. Clinicians monitor their sexual arousal to stimuli such 
as children, violence or bondage fantasies, using devices attached 
to the genitals to measure blood flow. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients are told to sniff ammonia during deviant sexual  
fantasies. Some also receive drugs such as Depo-Provera to depress 
sexual appetites. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is probably the best I've felt my whole life,'' said one  
43-year-old rapist, in and out of prison for five rapes over 20 
years, choking back tears as he described his progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned that I'm not the victim, I never was. I chose to  
do my crimes,'' he said. ``The treatment program has given me back 
my life. I have a future now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to California's Department of Mental Health, of the  
2,454 convicts who have been considered for treatment at Atascadero 
since the law changed, only 276 met the criteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Of these eligible inmates, 34 were set free, the DMH says. Of  
the remaining 242, 151 were committed to Atascadero, and 91 still 
await a ruling by a judge or jury (the choice is the inmate's). 
</P>
<P>
	Once committed, the first phase of an inmate's treatment is  
educational. It's at phase two that the problems begin. Only about 
one-quarter of those committed have agreed to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because phase two requires participants to sign an  
agreement that anything they say in therapy may be used against 
them in court. So an inmate who has already served his time for one 
crime may find himself being prosecuted all over again for another 
crime, or ruining his chance of a successful appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't go along with the treatment, they're  
noncooperative. If they go along with the treatment, they open 
themselves up to more prosecution,'' attorney Matulis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some inmates agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're all afraid if they put their name on a release form,  
they're going to be held responsible'' and reduce the chances of 
release, a 50-year-old twice-convicted child molester from Orange 
County said by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Another inmate, a 48-year-old man with reddish-blond hair, a  
mustache and an intense gaze, has refused phase two for more than a 
year. Convicted of rape twice, he came across as the angriest in 
the invited group. He claimed he didn't belong at Atascadero -- a 
warehouse for inmates, he said -- and that prosecutors, judges and 
staff are out to get him. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the taxpayers think they're spending their money on a  
successful treatment program, they're wrong. It's a flop,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, no one has completed the treatment program and been set  
free. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, each inmate of Atascadero costs the state about  
$107,000 a year, five times more than for a regular convict. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the high costs, 13 other states -- Arizona, Florida,  
Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, North 
Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Washington and Wisconsin -- have 
jumped at courts' invitation to keep sex offenders off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Psychiatric Association says that while child  
molesters, pedophiles and other similar offenders can be helped to 
reduce their urges, there is no effective treatment for rapists, 
who consciously choose to commit acts of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't a message the DMH wants to hear, says Dr. Ted  
Donaldson, a psychologist who used to evaluate candidates for 
Atascadero. He said he was asked to leave after finding that of 20 
offenders he tested between January and March 1996, only six met 
the criteria. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most sex offenders do not have any kind of mental impairment,  
they're just criminals. They should be in prison,'' said Donaldson, 
who now works primarily for defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want these guys living next door, but I'm not sure I'm  
willing to break the law to keep them in,'' he said. ``If you want 
to just lock them up, that's fine. Don't have a program with 
doctors walking in sprinkling holy water on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The therapists at Atascadero agree that there are no guarantees  
-- at best, the criminals' deviant desires can merely be curbed, 
their risk of committing new crimes reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	Fully aware that no proven treatment exists, Nelson says they've  
done enough research to at least be sure the patients belong there. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're able to identify that small group of folks,'' said  
Nelson. ``How successful that treatment will be remains to be 
seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 57-year-old schizophrenic with shoulder-length black hair said  
he went to prison in 1991 for forcing nine people to give him oral 
sex. He said his 18 months at Atascadero have been helpful. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never had treatment before. I've always fallen through  
the cracks,'' he said quietly. ``I've gained a lot from the 
program, but I'm one of the few.''

<HEADLINE> Actress Plato Dies of Overdose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOORE, Okla. (AP) -- Former ``Diff'rent Strokes'' actress Dana  
Plato, who had battled drug problems over the years, died of an 
accidental overdose Saturday night, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Sgt. Scott Singer said Ms. Plato, 34, had apparently  
taken the painkiller Loritab and Valium. ``The death appears to be 
an accidental overdose. We don't suspect suicide,'' Singer said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato played Kimberly Drummond on the NBC sitcom that ran  
from 1978 to 1984. Like her fellow child co-stars Gary Coleman and 
Todd Bridges, she has found herself in and out of trouble over the 
years since the show was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992 she received five years' probation for forging  
prescriptions for Valium. That probation was added to five years' 
probation for robbing a Las Vegas video store in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I hadn't gotten caught, it could have been the worst thing  
that happened to me because I could have died of a drug overdose,'' 
she told reporters in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato and her fiance, Robert Menchaca, had stopped at his  
parents' home in Moore for Mother's Day. She had arrived in 
Oklahoma after having appeared on the ``Howard Stern'' show in New 
York on Saturday as part of an effort to jumpstart her career. 
</P>
<P>
	Her recent career included mainly low-budget films such as  
1992's ``Bikini Beach Race'' and the 1997 film ``Different Strokes: 
A Story of Jack and Jill ... and Jill,'' a direct-to-video softcore 
tale about a sexual threesome. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato and Menchaca, 28, were en route to Los Angeles. They  
lived in Navarre, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer says Ms. Plato complained of being tired and went to take  
a nap Saturday afternoon. He said Menchaca, who was with her, 
realized about 9:40 p.m. that there was a problem. Menchaca's 
mother, a nurse, and his brother tried cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation to revive her but were unsuccessful. Rescue workers 
were called and she was dead on arrival at Southwestern Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer says toxicology results aren't expected for about six  
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, who played the lovable Arnold on the show, pleaded no  
contest in February to disturbing the peace for punching an 
autograph-seeker in the eye. He was ordered to attend anger 
management classes, fined and given a suspended jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Bridges, who played Willis on the sitcom, has been arrested  
several times. In 1990, Bridges was acquitted of assault with a 
deadly weapon in the near fatal shooting of a narcotics dealer in a 
Los Angeles drug den. 
</P>
<P>
	He once testified that he became depressed and turned to drugs  
after his show was canceled.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Party Canceled Out of Fear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A celebration billed as the biggest  
end-of-the-century party in this city is over before it started. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporations have apparently balked at sponsoring Minnesota  
Millennium Celebration over fears that the Y2K computer glitch 
could lead to embarrassing publicity, organizers of the event said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Design Group confirmed Friday that it has canceled the  
six-day, $8 million bash that was supposed to welcome in 2000 with 
concerts featuring national headliners and family activities at the 
Metrodome and the Minneapolis Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt we had a salable and marketable product, and nobody  
from the city or corporate America came forward,'' said Fred 
Shepherd, national director of sales for the Minneapolis company, 
which produced extravaganzas for the 1992 Super Bowl and last 
year's World Figure Skating Championships. ``I think they stayed 
away because of fear. 
</P>
<P>
	With the demise of the celebration, and with most events for St.  
Paul's family-oriented and alcohol-free Capital New Year moved up a 
day to Dec. 30, neither of the Twin City's downtowns has a gigantic 
party on its docket.

<HEADLINE> Stars, Blues Set for Game 3 / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The playoff experience Joe Nieuwendyk missed  
last year is putting him into overdrive this postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Stars center is among the league leaders in scoring  
heading into Game 3 of the second-round series tonight against the 
St. Louis Blues. He was at his best in Game 2 Saturday night with 
two goals, including the game-winner in overtime, and an assist 
that put the Stars ahead 2-0 in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it chewed him up inside that he wasn't a part of the  
playoff run last year,'' coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``He's making 
the most of it this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nieuwendyk, who sat out all but one game of the playoffs last  
year with a knee injury, has five goals and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was awful difficult watching last year,'' Nieuwendyk said.  
``That's a big part of it. I'm feeling good and I'm excited, I'm 
playing on adrenaline and having a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Too much fun for the Blues. Nieuwendyk had several other great  
scoring chances in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's obviously a world-class player,'' Blues winger Blair  
Atcheynum said. ``He's been a sparkplug in this series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game also is Brett Hull's first postseason appearance in St.  
Louis since he left as a free agent last summer. Hull has been 
downplaying the situation, citing frequent player turnover during 
his Blues' career. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 10 years in St. Louis, it was like I played on 10  
different teams,'' Hull said. ``There was never anybody there for 
more than a year or two except Grant Fuhr and Al MacInnis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars' fast start has the Blues back in familiar territory,  
trying to climb out of a hole. St. Louis rallied from a 3-1 series 
deficit to beat the Phoenix Coyotes in the first round, and the job 
this round already may be tougher considering the Stars were No. 1 
overall in the NHL in the regular season and are 6-0 in the 
playoffs thus far. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Game 2 could have gone either way. So nobody  
is uttering the dreaded ``backs-against-the-wall'' bromide yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dallas is on a great winning streak and I'm sure they feel  
they're in control,'' Blues coach Joel Quenneville said. ``I love 
the way we battled. It's a frustrating loss, but we proved to 
ourselves like we did in Game 3 against Phoenix that if you play 
like that, you find a way to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues didn't win Game 3 against Phoenix, but didn't quit  
after a poor start from goalie Grant Fuhr put them behind 4-0 early 
in the second period. The final was 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock certainly wasn't crowing after Game 2, which was  
filled with odd-man rushes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope I never see another game like that again,''  
Hitchcock said. ``That was one revved-up hockey game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues got a strong game Saturday from Pierre Turgeon, who  
had a goal and two assists after getting slashed on the back of the 
left knee by Pat Verbeek in Game 1. Turgeon had been a doubtful 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Verbeek and the Blues' Jamal Mayers, who took a retaliatory  
slash at Darryl Sydor in that game, will return tonight after 
serving one-game suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Quenneville also prodded Pavol Demitra, the team's leading  
scorer in the regular season, into productivity by putting him on 
the fourth line with enforcers Tony Twist and Tyson Nash. Demitra, 
who had been a team-worst minus-4 in the playoffs, had two goals. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis didn't practice Sunday after arriving home at about 3  
a.m., concluding a stretch where they were on the road 26 of 34 
days. Their flight was delayed when smoke filled the plane's cabin 
before departure.

<HEADLINE> Mutombo Wins IBM Stats Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dikembe Mutombo of the Atlanta Hawks is the  
winner of the NBA's IBM award, a computer-generated measure of a 
player's statistical contributions to his team. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutombo, who helped lead Atlanta to a 31-19 record by averaging  
10.8 points, 12.2 rebounds and 2.94 blocked shots, finished with a 
115.67 computer rating. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaquille O'Neal of the Lakers was second with a rating of  
102.86, Miami's Alonzo Mourning was third (100.63), followed by 
Detroit's Grant Hill (98.49) and Utah's Karl Malone (98.27). 
</P>
<P>
	Malone won the award last season, and David Robinson has won it  
five times. Michael Jordan won it twice. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is derived from a complicated formula: Points, field  
goal attempts, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks are added 
together, and personal fouls and turnovers are subtracted. That sum 
is added to the number of a team's victories multiplied by 10, and 
that total is multiplied by 250 to reach a number that is divided 
by team points minus field goal attempts plus rebounds, assists, 
steals and blocks minus personal fouls and turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutombo's award was announced Sunday. The Sixth Man Award will  
be announced Monday and the All-Defensive team will be named 
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Paper Tax Returns Challenge for IRS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COVINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- At row upon row of desks and tables spread  
over seven clamorous acres in a warehouse-like brick building, 
hundreds of IRS employees are working ``The Pipeline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teams of workers tear open thousands of tax returns, sort the  
paper and checks into slots at worn wooden tables, stamp a number 
on each by hand and then manually enter the sensitive financial 
information into computers. 
</P>
<P>
	These 2,500 people will process an estimated 10 million returns  
here this year the old-fashioned way. 
</P>
<P>
	In a quieter room at this IRS Service Center just across the  
Ohio River from Cincinnati, in space the size of three side-by-side 
refrigerators, softly whirring computers do the same job with about 
6 million electronic returns. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no chance of a lost check, a mistaken keystroke or a  
return placed in the wrong wooden slot. Nobody has to try to read a 
taxpayer's handwriting in crayon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you can have less paper, there's much less chance of  
error,'' said John Cosgrave, chief information officer at the 
Internal Revenue Service. ``It's a very big plus not only for us 
but also for the taxpayer who will see better service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contrast between the Industrial Age paper processing that  
still dominates the IRS and the fledgling electronic method 
underscores the monumental technology challenges facing the 
nation's tax collector as it struggles to improve service. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the 21st Century, the IRS still stores the  
``Master Files'' for individuals and businesses on tape that can 
only be updated once a week, causing delays and other obstacles in 
retrieving information. Its mainframe computer hardware is state of 
the art, but it also uses a language dating to the early 1960s that 
is no longer taught at universities. 
</P>
<P>
	Like a house with various additions but no connecting hallways,  
the IRS has tried to overcome these shortcomings with new computers 
that don't always talk to the older ones. The agency has 84 
mainframes from four vendors, 1,500 midsize computers from 23 
vendors and 100,000 individual computers. There are 11 different 
e-mail systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Such deficiencies have a profound impact on taxpayers. For  
instance, someone seeking information by telephone about their tax 
account might be frustrated when an IRS employee can't find updated 
information, such as a payment mailed a week before. Or perhaps the 
employee can't answer a tax law question right away because the 
computers aren't linked to each other. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Cincinnati center, for example, IRS employee Sharon  
Darrell had to painstakingly negotiate through nine different 
computer systems -- each with its own password -- to answer questions 
for a professional tax preparer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can only be into one system at a time,'' Darrell said.  
``When we get a new system, it will take the work less time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another limitation showed up earlier this year when the IRS  
tried to implement the new ``innocent spouse'' law, which ensures 
that husbands or wives won't be held liable for tax bills their 
partner is solely responsible for. The archaic tape ``Master 
Files'' at the Martinsburg, W. Va., computer center could not 
accommodate the law because it required that joint tax returns be 
split and tracked separately. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate file had to be created, meaning more cost and greater  
chance for error and delay. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti calls the current situation  
``fundamentally deficient'' and is embarking on a costly, long-term 
effort to replace the entire system and phase out the practice of 
keeping main taxpayer files on tape. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of false starts and billions of dollars wasted, the  
IRS last year awarded a contract to a consortium led by Computer 
Sciences Corp. to design a new system. Congress has put up $506 
million initially for the job, but it is expected to cost tens of 
billions of dollars more. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, all the new computers in the world can't change the  
limitations of paper tax returns. Of the 111.5 million individual 
returns received through April 23 nationwide, 82.5 million of them 
are the old-fashioned paper kind. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Cincinnati center and the other nine like it, employees  
often hired for tax season at modest wages must wade through stacks 
of returns. It's difficult to ``scan'' returns into computers 
because people fill them out on manual typewriters, with ballpoint 
pens, even in crayon. Returns are bound by hand into large 
envelopes and left sitting in dozens of carts as they await 
processing. 
</P>
<P>
	That is why IRS is pushing hard for electronic filing of  
returns, with the ambitious goal of 80 percent of all individual 
returns by 2007. This year, that figure will reach 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency hopes the combination of modernized mainframe  
computers and master files, better communication between the 
machines and employees who deal directly with taxpayers, and a 
majority of people filing electronically will gradually bring IRS 
into the Information Age. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to do right by taxpayers,'' said R. Wayne Harris,  
acting district director in Cincinnati. ``Sometimes the technology 
doesn't allow our employees to do all they want. Any system that 
allows us to do that will be welcomed.''

<HEADLINE> Compaq To Cut Distributors to Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. is set to announce plans to  
slash the number of distributors who sell its products to four from 
about 40, according to a letter to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	A conference call has been scheduled for Monday, but the company  
told analysts late Friday, said Ashok Kumar at U.S. Bancorp Piper 
Jaffray. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've talked about consolidation under the old regime for  
quite some time,'' Kumar said Saturday. ``I think for the first 
time we're starting to see decisive action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move would be chairman Ben Rosen's first major move since  
supplanting Eckhard Pfeiffer as chief executive last month. The 
idea is to allow Compaq to lower costs and better manage inventory 
and track demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Kumar identified Ingram Micro, Tech Data Corp., Merisel and  
CompuCom Systems as the surviving distributors. The companies 
already work very closely with the Houston-based computer giant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think very clearly this makes sense in that it gives Compaq  
more control over logistics,'' Kumar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones News Wires also identified Inacom as a distributor  
likely making the cut. Stock prices for all five companies rose 
sharply Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq did not publicly confirm or deny the report. Shares rose  
25 cents to $24.87 1/2 in heavy trading Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kumar, who expressed confidence last month that Rosen could  
stimulate Compaq after recent sluggish performance, applauded his 
transitional management team for the distribution decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows they're making difficult decisions and making them  
decisively,'' Kumar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Directors ousted Pfeiffer on April 18, nine days after the  
company announced first-quarter earnings would fall far short of 
analysts' expectations. The news plunged Compaq stock by 22 percent 
April 12.

<HEADLINE> Nome Wants To Honor Ties to Earp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NOME, Alaska (AP) -- This still untamed Gold Rush town wants  
Kevin Costner to help celebrate its 100th birthday this summer, 
along with anybody else who played Wyatt Earp in the movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Earp's enduring fame comes from being a marshal in Tombstone,  
Ariz., site of the legendary 1882 shootout at the OK Corral. Less 
well-known is that he spent two years in turn-of-the-century Nome 
at a time when the city's beaches were surrendering tons of gold to 
frenzied prospectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Farflung even by Alaska standards, the city of 4,000 remains a  
saucy, frontier town, perhaps best known as the finish of the 
Iditarod Sled Dog Race. Fittingly, the courting of Costner, an 
Oscar-winner for ``Dances With Wolves,'' isn't being pursued with 
much reverence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a wolf I want danced with,'' wisecracked Cussy Kauer,  
one of the Earp party organizers. ``I've got him chained up in 
front of my house in case he shows up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Fourth of July centennial celebration, Nome has sent  
Costner a formal invitation for what's being billed as ``Wyatt Earp 
Weekend,'' complete with a gunfight on the town's main street. 
</P>
<P>
	The star of the 1994 film ``Wyatt Earp'' hasn't accepted, but he  
hasn't declined, unlike Kurt Russell, who played Earp in 1993's 
``Tombstone.'' He'll be shooting a movie overseas in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The late Henry Fonda, James Stewart and Burt Lancaster all  
portrayed Earp on celluloid, along with Randolph Scott and Joel 
McCrea. So did James Garner. Even Ronald Reagan took a turn, in 
``Law and Order'' in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all the Earp movies, Costner's gets closest to Alaska -- its  
final scene shows him on a ship approaching the Bering Sea coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Why Wyatt?  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to draw as much attention as possible to Nome,'' said  
Laura Samuelson, a local museum director and the party's organizer. 
``I want to expose Nome's history from the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And at the beginning, Earp was there.  
</P>
<P>
	Nome in those early days was the Wild North, a place that could  
certainly have used the talents of a seasoned lawman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a den of iniquity, probably unequaled anywhere,'' said  
Howard Clifford, who is writing a book about Earp's life in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	But like everyone else, Earp came to Alaska to make money. He  
built a saloon -- the first wooden building in this treeless corner 
of the globe -- that made him rich. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of the better times of his life,'' said Clifford of  
Seattle. ``He wrote a letter to his brothers saying he was making a 
fortune mining the miners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to hook a celebrity is tough when the destination is far  
away and the budget is tight, organizers said. Even efforts to land 
a TV star, Hugh O'Brien, who got famous portraying Earp in the 
early years of television, have fallen flat.

<HEADLINE> Blazers Hurt Suns From Many Spots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns spent much of Sunday  
worrying about Isaiah Rider. Based upon recent history, they should 
now be wondering which of the Portland Trail Blazers might hurt 
them next. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider scored 17 of his playoff career-high 25 points in the  
second half Saturday to lead the Blazers past the Suns 95-85 in the 
opener of their best-of-5 series. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider shot extremely well, but all season he has shown a  
tendency to flop after strong outings: He scored 20 or more points 
six times this season, and in the next game averaged just 10 points 
and 38 percent shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately for Rider, seven other Blazers have scored 21 or  
more in a game this season, so someone can pick up the scoring 
slack should he suddenly cool off in Monday's Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm not there, anybody can be the go-to guy,'' Rider said  
before Sunday's practice at the Rose Garden. ``If Damon 
(Stoudamire) is hot, he's going to be our go-to guy. If (Arvydas 
Sabonis) has a better offensive game, he's going to be our go-to 
guy. So it just depends who's rolling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portland won its first Game 1 of a series since 1992 with a  
superior inside game and good defense from their guards -- 
characteristics that have helped Portland beat the Suns all four 
times this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix coach Danny Ainge said he'll use more double-teams on  
Rider when he posts up. But Ainge doesn't feel the need to double 
the 7-foot-3 Sabonis or power forward Brian Grant, even though the 
two players combined to make nine of their 13 shots Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, the Suns don't feel they need to change much at all.  
They played the Blazers close in all four games this season, and 
Saturday it was a late 8-0 run that allowed Portland to pull away. 
Rider scored four points, and Brian Grant's tip-in made it 85-75 
with 1:41 left. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just missed some shots that we normally haven't missed,''  
said the Suns' Jason Kidd, who said he had a ``terrible'' game 
despite 17 points and seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Ainge bristled when a reporter asked whether the Suns' best hope  
was to keep it close and have a chance to pull out a victory in the 
final few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want an opportunity to win. We want to win,'' he  
said. ``I've heard that a lot throughout my career. People say, 
`That's all you can ask for is a chance.' No, that's a bunch of 
garbage. We want to win. Everybody has a chance to win. So we need 
to execute down the stretch offensively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix has other problems. For once this season, the Suns held  
their own on the boards against the Blazers but still lost. Center 
Luc Longley scored just two points on 1-of-6 shooting against 
Sabonis, who almost gave the illusion of quickness while blocking 
Longley's jumper on one play. 
</P>
<P>
	``He crept up on me on that one. He snuck me,'' Longley said.  
``Sometimes you forget how long he is. He can cover a lot of ground 
very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns got a lift from their bench, with George McCloud  
scoring 15 points on 3-of-7 from 3-point range. He also did a 
better job guarding Rider than did the more slender Rex Chapman. 
Danny Manning scoring 14 points on 5-of-8 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix's bench outscored Portland's 36-27, but that could  
change Monday if Blazers reserves Greg Anthony, Jim Jackson and 
Walt Williams get hot from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got 10 or 12 guys, and they just keep bringing them on  
in shifts, like a hockey squad almost,'' Longley said. ``That's why 
in the fourth quarter sometimes they've got their legs under 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers like to run and shoot from the outside, but if  
there's no double-team on the big men, they plan to keep going to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will just keep pounding it inside until they prove they can  
stop us,'' Anthony said. ``We feel it is to our advantage to post 
up on these guys, and we'd be fools not to take advantage of our 
strengths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said his only worry is that the Suns' shooters will  
start hitting. Rex Chapman scored just nine points on 3-of-12 
shooting, continuing a mostly season-long slump. And other Suns 
missed apparently wide-open looks. 
</P>
<P>
	Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy said there's almost more pressure on  
his team to win Game 2 and maintain the home court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their job was to come in here and get one,'' Dunleavy said of  
the Suns. ``Whether it be the first one or the second one, I don't 
think they're going to care. So from our standpoint, we've got to 
still defend our house.''

<HEADLINE> CBS, Mitsubishi Ink HDTV Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The majority of CBS' prime-time lineup this fall  
will available in the new HDTV format as the media company 
continues to make further commitments to digital broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Digital Electronics America Inc. will exclusively  
sponsor the programs, CBS Corp. said Saturday. CBS did not identify 
which programs would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	HDTV, or high-definition television, provides viewers with much  
sharper images than are available through regular analog 
televisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Special sets and tuners costing thousands of dollars is needed  
to pick up the digital transmissions, however. Only about 60 of the 
nation's 1,500 television stations now offer HDTV programming or 
have applied for a permit, further limiting the appeal for 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators now require stations in the 10 largest U.S.  
cities to send digital signals. This fall, another 20 cities will 
face that requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, MDEA television dealers will be able to  
advertise across all of CBS' media platforms, including television 
stations, Infinity Broadcasting radio stations and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The increase in HDTV programming resulting from this  
sponsorship will further assure consumers who have purchased HDTV 
products that they have made a wise investment and can begin 
enjoying a greater number of programs,'' said Max Wasinger, vice 
president in sales and marketing for MDEA. 
</P>
<P>
	By Nov. 1, CBS expects to be transmitting digital programming  
across more than 40 stations, reaching more than 50 percent of the 
United States. Currently only 14 CBS-owned and affiliated stations 
have the capability.

<HEADLINE> Cosby Tells Graduates: Move Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORANGEBURG, S.C. (AP) -- Speaking to new graduates of Claflin  
College, Bill Cosby made a plea for beleaguered parents everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the name of God move on,'' Cosby said Saturday. ``Because a  
house can't take three grown people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actor and comedian sported a Claflin T-shirt and cap,  
sweatpants and tennis shoes. His wry observations about parenthood 
drew raucous laughter and applause from both parents and students. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of you are going back home and people are not happy,'' he  
told graduates of the historically black college. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosby recalled his college days at Temple University in  
Philadelphia, where his favorite subjects were political science 
and philosophy because professors asked questions that no one could 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
	One professor wanted to know if a glass was half full or half  
empty. Cosby returned to class with the wisdom of his grandmother, 
who told him that ``it depends on if you're drinking or pouring.''

<HEADLINE> BSO Canceling China Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Fearful of growing instability in China after  
NATO's accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, the 
Boston Symphony Orchestra has apparently canceled two concerts in 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	The orchestra planned four performances in Japan and two  
performances in China to celebrate Seiji Ozawa's 25th anniversary 
as music director. 
</P>
<P>
	After a final performance in Osaka, Japan on Monday night, the  
BSO was scheduled to perform in Beijing on Wednesday and Thursday. 
China's Premier Zhu Rongji and President Jiang Zemin were to attend 
Thursday's concert in Beijing's Great Hall of the People. 
</P>
<P>
	But Makoto Morita, a spokesman for Osaka's Festival Hall, where  
the symphony was scheduled to play Monday night, said Sunday the 
trip to China was canceled because of instability in that country. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav media reported three people were killed when NATO  
missiles struck the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on Saturday. More 
than 20 were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, demonstrators hurled rocks and debris into the U.S.  
Embassy in China, trapping American diplomats inside their compound 
in a second day of protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone calls to orchestra officials in Boston were not  
immediately returned Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Bring Spencer Back Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Yankees reshuffled their left  
fielders yet again today, sending slumping World Series hero Ricky 
Ledee down to the minors and bringing back Shane Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees announced the move shortly after Ledee, playing as a  
pinch-runner, scored the final run in the eighth inning of a 6-1 
victory over Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Ledee, 25, was optioned to Triple-A Columbus and Spencer, 27,  
was recalled from the International League club. 
</P>
<P>
	Ledee, who went 6-for-10 and drove in four runs during the  
Yankees' sweep of San Diego last October, was hitting just .200 
(9-for-45) with no home runs and five RBIs. He had struck out 15 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer, a September sensation with the Yankees, started this  
season with New York before being farmed out on April 29. At the 
time, he had not played in 11 days and was only 2-for-11 with two 
RBIs for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt this was the move to make at this time,'' Yankees  
interim manager Don Zimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was in a little rut, offensively and defensively,'' he said  
of Ledee. ``The best thing for him is to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Curtis started in left field for the Yankees on Sunday,  
scoring three runs and stealing a base. He is hitting just .161, 
but his 14 walks boosted his on-base percentage to .339. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer did well after being sent to Columbus. Going into  
Sunday, he was batting .344 (11-for-32) with one homer and four 
RBIs in eight games for the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer and Ledee each created quite a stir for the Yankees late  
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ledee saw limited time in the regular season, and did not have a  
hit in the first two rounds of the playoffs. He then became the 
first rookie outfielder to start for the Yankees in the World 
Series since Tom Tresh in 1962, and hit a two-run double off Kevin 
Brown in his first at-bat in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer, who had spent nine years in the minors, enjoyed an  
incredible rookie year. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer hit .373 with 10 home runs and 27 RBIs in only 67  
at-bats, and became only the seventh Yankees player to hit three 
grand slams in a season. He also hit two home runs against Texas in 
the first round of the playoffs 
</P>
<P>
	Based on that, big things were predicted for both Ledee and  
Spencer, particularly after Darryl Strawberry's physical and legal 
problems took him out of the left-field mix early this year. But 
neither of them produced much after making the opening-day roster.

<HEADLINE> Mutombo Rules Middle As Hawks Win  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- In a melancholy mood, Dikembe Mutombo reflected  
Sunday on the death of his mother and the dominant role he played 
in Atlanta's first victory of the NBA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit Pistons preferred to focus on Mutombo's elbows.  
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-2 center scored 17 points, grabbed 19 rebounds,  
blocked six shots and dished out a couple of lethal elbows during 
Atlanta's 90-70 thrashing of the Pistons in Game 1 of the best-of-5 
series Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams spent the off day working out at the Georgia Dome,  
where Game 2 will be held Monday night before the series shifts to 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're approaching this stage of your career, you want to  
accomplish something big,'' said Mutombo, a two-time Defensive 
Player of the Year who's still seeking his first championship at 
age 32. ``I love being the top defensive player in the game, but I 
want to be on top. I want to get a ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mutombo played a key role as the Hawks held Detroit to the  
lowest playoff output in team history. The Pistons went more than 
7 1/2 minutes in the third quarter without scoring and finished with 
only 27 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``He takes away all the easy baskets you normally get,'' said  
Joe Dumars, who was held to three points on 1-of-5 shooting. ``In 
most games, you can count on five or six easy baskets. He 
eliminates that. And when you're not getting those 10 or 12 points, 
it makes it tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On his way to the Georgia Dome, Mutombo made a detour to pick up  
teammate Alan Henderson, who isn't able to drive because of double 
vision caused by an abrasion on his left eye. When Mutombo arrived, 
Henderson was on the phone wishing his mom a happy Mother's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutombo's own mother died seven months ago after she was denied  
medical help in war-torn Congo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish she was still around,'' he said, a pained expression on  
his face. ``I still love her. I still miss her. It bothers me a lot 
when days like this come around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pistons are perturbed about Mutombo's wicked elbows, which  
were responsible for a few broken noses during the regular season 
and inflicted more damage in the first game of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsey Hunter arrived at the dome looking like the loser in a  
heavyweight title fight. He could barely open his right eye, which 
was badly bruised after colliding with a Mutombo elbow in the 
opening minute. Later in the game, Christian Laettner took a blow 
to the face. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ridiculous,'' Detroit coach Alvin Gentry said. ``The guy  
already broke three people's noses during a 50-game regular season. 
It's got to stop, one way or the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mutombo was not called for a foul on either play.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it was done intentionally or not,'' Gentry  
said. ``But the rule book says if you get hit by an elbow, it's got 
to be a foul. Somewhere along the line, it's got to be corrected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter apparently had trouble seeing the basket, hitting only  
2-of-9 from the field and finishing with seven points. But then, no 
Detroit player other than Grant Hill scored in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks seem intent of letting Hill get his inevitable points  
-- he had a game-high 26 -- and shutting down the rest of the Pistons 
offense. Hill made 10-of-18 from the field, but the rest of the 
team hit less than 32 percent on 18-of-57 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Gentry said it was important for the Pistons' big men -- Bison  
Dele, Eric Montross, Jerome Williams and Laettner -- to draw Mutombo 
away from the basket by hitting some outside shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``To go inside against Mutombo is not the most intelligent thing  
in the world,'' Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter is expected to play despite his sore eye, but the  
prognosis isn't as promising for Henderson. He played only four 
minutes in the opener -- wearing a special pair of goggles to help 
cope with the double vision -- and sat on sideline during Sunday's 
practice, a patch covering his injured eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult to see,'' said Henderson, unsure when he  
will be fully recovered. ``It's a very slow process, very hard to 
pinpoint.''

<HEADLINE> Hornets Owner Starts Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- George Shinn has started over in a search  
for a partner to share ownership of the NBA Charlotte Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan said Saturday he broke off negotiations with  
Shinn because of a disagreement over how much control over 
basketball operations the former Chicago Bulls star would have. 
After the announcement Shinn said other interested people have 
approached him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the discussions between Michael and I were announced, I  
have received numerous inquiries from others who are interested in 
the possibility of a partnership in the Hornets,'' Shinn said in a 
statement released Saturday night. ``Out of respect for Michael and 
the discussions that we were conducting, I did not follow up on any 
of those inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point I plan to review those opportunities and proceed  
accordingly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn did not mention any names, but at least one has been  
mentioned before. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Johnson, chief executive officer of Black Entertainment  
Television, has said he had no interest in becoming a partner but 
would like to buy the team outright, something Jordan said Friday 
he had offered to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn said he ``tried to be flexible'' in the negotiations with  
Jordan but said he is not willing to give up all control or sell 
the entire franchise to Jordan ``even at a higher price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After exchanging several proposals, the two came to an impasse  
this week over the issue of control. Shinn offered to sell Jordan 
half of the franchise for ``several million dollars'' below 50 
percent of Shinn's market-value price of $160 million and would 
give Jordan control over all basketball operations, including 
salaries, and an equal voice in all business matters, sources told 
The Charlotte Observer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan also said he was willing to re-open negotiations, but  
only if it was done soon and did not include control as an open 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to George,'' Jordan said. ``I could not accept a  
situation where I could not (have final say). 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm open-minded. But it's a dead issue on the control issue.  
We can always accommodate his financial pressures.''

<HEADLINE>  Pope Makes Rare Romanian Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Pope John Paul II pushed ahead Sunday  
with efforts to break down barriers that divide Christianity, 
calling on Orthodox Christians in Romania to ``exchange the embrace 
of peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first visit by a Roman pontiff to a mainly Orthodox  
country in nearly 1,000 years, the pope embraced Romania's Orthodox 
patriarch and declared the time has come to put ``every form of 
fear and suspicion'' between their churches behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope's three-day trip to Romania was also seen as a  
launching pad for John Paul's ambitious plans: a meeting with the 
patriarch of Russia, leader of the largest Orthodox church, and a 
trip to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time is always the hardest,'' papal spokesman  
Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Romania trip ``had more than opened the door'' for better  
relations with Moscow, he said. ``It's a breakthrough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said there were still no concrete plans for a meeting  
with Moscow Patriarch Alexy II, who torpedoed a planned meeting 
with the pope at the last minute two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In a significant gesture by John Paul, Romanian Patriarch  
Teoctist announced the pope contributed an unspecified amount of 
money for construction of a massive Orthodox basilica in Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
	Orthodox clergy have frequently accused the Vatican of spending  
its money to build its own churches and to convert Orthodox 
believers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 100,000 people filled Union Square in the heart of  
Bucharest for the Orthodox service, the first such open-air service 
by the Orthodox church here. Most attending were Orthodox, but 
there were small groups of Catholics scattered in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, Patriarch Teoctist attended a Roman Catholic  
Mass in a park, the pope's last public event before returning to 
Rome. At least 200,000 people turned out, most coming to Bucharest 
from Catholic areas in northern Transylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	In his afternoon homily, the pope said that until recently it  
would have been ``unthinkable'' for a Roman pontiff to visit 
Romania. ``Today, after a long winter of suffering and persecution, 
we can finally exchange the embrace of peace and together praise 
the Lord.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the Mass, John Paul invited the Romanian patriarch  
to visit him at the Vatican. Hearing these words, the crowd 
responded, shouting repeatedly: ``Unity! Unity!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of people passed out from heat exhaustion and not eating,  
doctors said. Others sung and murmured prayers, and a wooden fence 
collapsed as people surged forward to get a better view of the 
pope. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul's trip was the first by a Roman pontiff to a mainly  
Orthodox country since the Eastern church definitively broke from 
Rome in the Great Schism of 1054. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polish-born pope, who will be 79 on May 18, has made  
reconciliation among Christians a principal goal for the start of 
Christianity's third millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I express the hope that Christians will find themselves, if  
not fully united, closer to full communion,'' the pope said earlier 
in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	In line with John Paul's frequent calls for Christians to  
recognize their sins of the past, the patriarch said Christians 
must recognize their responsibilities ``for the suffering, the 
madness and the mistakes that they have provoked in the world over 
the centuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 84-year-old patriarch, wearing white robes and a Byzantine  
miter, presided at the Divine Liturgy. John Paul followed the 
liturgy seated on the altar, then addressed the crowd at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul, weakened by ailments over the years, leaned on his  
silver staff for support during the 3 1/2-hour service. He walked away 
slowly, giving his blessing as the crowd waved tiny Romanian and 
Vatican flags, but appeared to be bearing up. He departed for Rome 
on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of Sunday's service, Orthodox priests prayed for an  
end to the war in nearby Kosovo and for the hundreds of thousands 
of ethnic Albanians who have been forced to flee their homes.

<HEADLINE> Clapton Sees No-Booze New Year Bash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Eric Clapton is planning a New Year's Eve party  
for people who don't want to greet the millennium in an alcoholic 
haze. 
</P>
<P>
	Clapton, who stopped drinking almost 12 years ago and also  
battled drug addiction, told the British Broadcasting Corp. on 
Sunday that he will play with a band during the invitation-only 
party, which will be held at an undisclosed location in the English 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	``We devised this little thing where we put on a dance,'' he  
said. ``It's all very secret. It's like a little gathering of 
people who don't drink anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guitarist best-known for the classic rock song ``Layla''  
said the idea was prompted by past New Year's Eves, which he called 
``the worst night of the year for people who don't drink.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to watch New Year's Eve on TV and feel really miserable  
and lonely and think `I'm not drinking.' There's nowhere I can go, 
you know, as a sober person,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Clapton opened a non-profit rehabilitation clinic on  
the Caribbean Island of Antigua. He told the BBC he also has worked 
as an unpaid volunteer at the Priory Clinic in London, a 
rehabilitation facility.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Makes Rare Romanian Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Pope John Paul II pushed ahead Sunday  
with efforts to break down barriers that divide Christianity, 
calling on Orthodox Christians in Romania to ``exchange the embrace 
of peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first visit by a Roman pontiff to a mainly Orthodox  
country in nearly 1,000 years, the pope embraced Romania's Orthodox 
patriarch and declared the time has come to put ``every form of 
fear and suspicion'' between their churches behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope's three-day trip to Romania was also seen as a  
launching pad for John Paul's ambitious plans: a meeting with the 
patriarch of Russia, leader of the largest Orthodox church, and a 
trip to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time is always the hardest,'' papal spokesman  
Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Romania trip ``had more than opened the door'' for better  
relations with Moscow, he said. ``It's a breakthrough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said there were still no concrete plans for a meeting  
with Moscow Patriarch Alexy II, who torpedoed a planned meeting 
with the pope at the last minute two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In a significant gesture by John Paul, Romanian Patriarch  
Teoctist announced the pope contributed an unspecified amount of 
money for construction of a massive Orthodox basilica in Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
	Orthodox clergy have frequently accused the Vatican of spending  
its money to build its own churches and to convert Orthodox 
believers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 100,000 people filled Union Square in the heart of  
Bucharest for the Orthodox service, the first such open-air service 
by the Orthodox church here. Most attending were Orthodox, but 
there were small groups of Catholics scattered in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, Patriarch Teoctist attended a Roman Catholic  
Mass in a park, the pope's last public event before returning to 
Rome. At least 200,000 people turned out, most coming to Bucharest 
from Catholic areas in northern Transylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	In his afternoon homily, the pope said that until recently it  
would have been ``unthinkable'' for a Roman pontiff to visit 
Romania. ``Today, after a long winter of suffering and persecution, 
we can finally exchange the embrace of peace and together praise 
the Lord.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the Mass, John Paul invited the Romanian patriarch  
to visit him at the Vatican. Hearing these words, the crowd 
responded, shouting repeatedly: ``Unity! Unity!'' 
</P>
<P>

collapsed as people surged forward to get a better view of the 
pope. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul's trip was the first by a Roman pontiff to a mainly  
Orthodox country since the Eastern church definitively broke from 
Rome in the Great Schism of 1054. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polish-born pope, who will be 79 on May 18, has made

<HEADLINE> Monica Pops Up on 'Saturday Night' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At one time, it might have been a Monica  
Lewinsky fantasy: living in a Malibu beach house with ex-President 
Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it was just a skit on ``Saturday Night Live.'' The  
former White House intern told jokes at the expense of Clinton and 
her ex-friend, Linda Tripp, during an appearance on the NBC comedy 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	She was also in a second segment, dispensing advice on phone sex  
and affairs with older men along with actor Tim Meadows, who 
portrayed a '70s style ``ladies' man'' conducting a telephone 
call-in show. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC had tried to keep Ms. Lewinsky's appearance on the show a  
secret. But word slipped out when she was seen during the week in 
the ``Saturday Night Live'' studio for rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Malibu beach house skit was actually depicted as Clinton's  
dream. Actor Darrell Hammond, who impersonates Clinton, wore a 
white bathrobe and was tempted by an offer of a lunch date with two 
prostitutes by Meadows, playing Vernon Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky entered the beach house, coming home from work, and  
Clinton asked how her day went. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone gets so mad at me when I turn the wrong letters,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton tried to make her feel better with a gift -- a copy of  
``Leaves of Grass'' by Walt Whitman. Ms. Lewinsky pointed out he'd 
given her that book before. 
</P>
<P>
	She then balked at Clinton's request to have lunch with Jordan.  
``Come on, baby,'' he said. ``Don't you trust me?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, in your dreams, you big creep,'' Ms. Lewinsky replied,  
echoing the nickname she gave Clinton in tape recordings of her 
conversations with Linda Tripp. 
</P>
<P>
	Meadows introduced Ms. Lewinsky during the second skit as  
someone ``who has done more to educate this country in the ways of 
love than anybody else on this planet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She told one advice-seeker it's not a good idea to have an  
affair with her much older boss. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, people in the office will start gossiping,'' she said,  
``and the next thing you know your face is all over Arabic 
newspapers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another caller wanted to know if she should have phone sex. ``I  
had phone sex with this one guy,'' Ms. Lewinsky said. ``His name 
doesn't really matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't we just call him William Howard Taft?'' Meadows  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor John Goodman, who has portrayed Tripp in past shows,  
called as that character to seek Ms. Lewinsky's forgiveness. ``No 
way,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> ACLU Targets Nervous School Heads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Eleven students are suspended for putting a  
satirical essay on their personal Web site. A teen-ager is sent to 
the police station for wearing black clothing. A student is 
interrogated about the chemistry book he's carrying. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the nation, American Civil Liberties Union offices say  
they're being swamped by complaints that nervous school officials 
are trampling students' constitutional rights since the April 20 
shootings in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to have become a witch hunt. I'm sure we've gotten  
hundreds of phone calls,'' said Ann Beeson, a staff attorney at the 
ACLU's national headquarters in New York. ``Most school officials 
are not aware or not focusing on the fact that students are 
citizens, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Daniels of the ACLU in Ohio said the most serious of more  
than two dozen complaints to his office involved 11 students from 
Brimfield, a small town about 30 miles southeast of Cleveland. The 
students had a Web site for the Gothic subculture of youths who 
wear black, listen to rocker Marilyn Manson and think a lot about 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Colorado gunmen embraced some Goth trappings but also  
exhibited racist attitudes and violence that most in the Goth world 
reject. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site, filled with images of dragons and castles and dark  
poetry, had been created months before the Littleton shootings but 
was updated with comment on the massacre. The students called 
gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold fellow ``freaks'' and 
sarcastically praised them. 
</P>
<P>
	One statement read: ``I wonder how long it'll be before we're  
allowed to wear our trenchcoats anymore. You know those screwed up 
kids in Colorado were wearing them, so that means I will also kill 
someone, and so will all my friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Timm Mackley, the school district's superintendent, said the Web  
site was obscene and had a threatening tone. He suspended the 
students, but the ACLU successfully fought their expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The students were engaging in protected speech, off campus,''  
Daniels said. ``The school says they can punish them for that type 
of speech and behavior. What's next? Regulating conversations off 
campus?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A consultant on school security cautioned that while there may  
be some overreaction, heightened awareness now may be uncovering 
real threats that predate Littleton, as well as ``spinoff-type 
incidents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We keep getting asked the question, `Is Littleton a wake-up  
call?' My question is, are we going to hit the snooze button and go 
to sleep?'' said Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety 
and Security Services in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Firm, fair and consistent enforcement of school rules and the  
law'' is the only recourse for school administrators, Trump said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	ACLU officials said most of the complaints they're hearing deal  
with teens getting in trouble for wearing trenchcoats or dressing 
in black. Some other cases: 
</P>
<P>
	-- A 13-year-old Arizona boy was given in-school detention for  
carrying an electronics magazine with ads for guns. The boy was 
arrested when he drew a cartoon showing the school blowing up. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A 14-year-old Pennsylvania girl was suspended for telling a  
teacher in a class conversation on the Littleton shootings that she 
could understand how someone who is teased endlessly could snap. 
</P>
<P>
	-- An Illinois student was questioned by a psychiatrist for 1 1/2  
hours about the video games he plays and asked if he ever looks for 
bomb-making instructions on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really scares me. Anybody who doesn't fit into a specific  
category or dresses differently or is considered a nerd or a geek, 
all of a sudden they're a suspect. The students are losing their 
constitutional rights,'' said Andy Brumme, staff counsel for the 
ACLU in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Brumme represented a 17-year-old North Augusta, S.C., student  
who was suspended for criticizing his principal and ROTC teachers 
at Midland Valley High School. On his personal Web page, he told 
ROTC teachers to ``eat feces and die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School administrators had talked to the teen about the Web site  
before but didn't take action until after the Colorado shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ludicrous to think that's a threat,'' Brumme said.  
``People are reacting instead of thinking.'' Brumme said the 
student had a good case but agreed to remove the criticism and 
apologize so he could graduate and go on to college this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Brumme said he was considering filing a complaint after police  
searched three suburban Columbia high school students who were sent 
to the principal's office for wearing all black. He said one of the 
students was asked why he was carrying a chemistry book. 
</P>
<P>
	``Schools are saying that school safety comes first and  
students' rights second. That's wrong,'' said Eleanor Eisenberg, 
executive director of the ACLU in Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Donate Time To Help Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jean Male is a tax lawyer, but she also makes  
time for a different kind of client -- an abused child who can only 
pay for her services with handmade pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	Male is among about 200 lawyers trained by the nonprofit group  
Lawyers for Children America to provide free legal help to abused 
and neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it means something to the child that I'm somebody who  
is there for them and is no one else's attorney,'' Male said. 
``This child makes pictures for me and gives them to me. That's 
pretty special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aviation lawyer Louise Cobbs says her volunteer work for a  
pre-teen girl who alleges she was molested by a relative is a 
challenge, but a rewarding one. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can see an immediate impact on the life of the child,''  
Cobbs said. ``It's nice to know that this child is at least safe 
for the time being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before taking on those cases, Male and Cobbs were trained by  
Lawyers for Children America on how to handle them -- a big switch 
from their specialties. 
</P>
<P>
	Begun in 1994 as an in-house legal aid program at Aetna Life &AMP;  
Casualty in Hartford, Conn., the nonprofit group now offers 
training in three other Connecticut cities as well as in Washington 
and Miami, where law firms have donated office space. 
</P>
<P>
	A committed attorney ``could really change the nature of the  
case and whole future for this child,'' Juliet McKenna, one of two 
program directors in the Washington office, told lawyers at a 
recent training session. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, children removed from their homes in abuse or  
neglect cases are appointed a lawyer, either a court appointee or a 
Lawyers for Children volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys named to represent a child also serve as ``guardian ad  
litem,'' someone whose role is to represent the child's best 
interests even if that is not exactly what the child wants. The 
child does not live with the guardian, but most often is placed 
with a relative or in a foster home. 
</P>
<P>
	Child abuse and neglect proceedings are civil cases, although  
the abuser also may face criminal charges. The goal is to ensure a 
safe, permanent home for the child, either reunited with one or 
both parents or with an adoptive family. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to representing the child in court, the volunteer  
lawyer must meet with the child regularly and make sure his or her 
needs are being met. 
</P>
<P>
	``While you are always the lawyer for the child, you have to  
define your advocacy role as very broad,'' McKenna said. Attorneys 
often find themselves doing things ``you would never do in your day 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes it helps to get the child a familiar object from home,  
she said. Or perhaps the child needs new eyeglasses or wants to 
attend religious services. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaining the child's trust is a crucial first step, and it isn't  
always easy, said Dr. Nora Galil, a psychiatrist with Children's 
National Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``The normal, average child is going to kind of look you over  
and not immediately become your best friend,'' Galil said. Start 
with non-threatening topics like school or favorite television 
shows, she said. ``If they're comfortable talking with you about 
small things, they're usually comfortable about talking about 
bigger things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Try not to show surprise at what the child says because it might  
make them clam up, Galil said, adding, ``Some of these kids live 
through some unbelievable things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Visiting the child's home is part of the job, and the lawyers  
were told to be ready for economic and cultural differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to look like your house. It's going to be  
small,'' with many children, said Trudy Mitchell-Gilkey, a social 
worker with the Child and Family Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Children staffers go with volunteer lawyers to  
initial court appearances and are available to offer advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We go on the assumption that they don't have expertise in this  
area,'' said Lesley Mara, the organization's executive director in 
Hartford. ``They cannot know all of the possible things that can 
happen to them in a case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Greg Yates, who attended the training session,  
practices commercial real estate and bankruptcy law. He said his 
status as a new father ``got me thinking about how I could make a 
difference. There are so many people who need legal services and it 
doesn't take a whole lot of time to provide it.''

<HEADLINE> Heat Left Wondering in Knicks Win  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- One day after the Miami Heat's worst playoff loss  
in two years, a team built on intensity and hustle was stunned to 
see just how feeble an effort they could produce. 
</P>
<P>
	``Terrible, with a capital T,'' center Alonzo Mourning said  
Sunday after two hours of watching film of Miami's 95-75 loss to 
the New York Knicks in the opener of their first-round series. ``We 
just didn't look like a professional basketball team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 of the best-of-5 series is Monday night at Miami Arena,  
where the Knicks now have embarrassed the Heat twice in the past 2 1/2 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to want to make a statement, get their fans  
behind them again,'' Knicks forward Kurt Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday was the Heat's worst playoff defeat since a 98-74 loss  
to Chicago in the 1997 Eastern Conference finals. At least then 
they had the excuse of being whipped by Michael Jordan and Scottie 
Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no such rejoinders this time. Saturday's loss went  
against just about everything the Heat holds sacred. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wakes you up,'' said Dan Majerle, who scored one point in  
28 minutes. ``If you'd have asked anybody last night if we played 
hard, we'd have said yes. Then you look at the film and realize 
you're not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York shot 53 percent from the floor, going 5-of-10 from  
3-point range. During the regular season, only four Heat opponents 
managed to hit half their shots. 
</P>
<P>
	On offense, Miami got 27 points from Mourning but otherwise  
settled for outside shots. Take away Mourning's 10-for-16 
performance, and the Heat shot just 27 percent (17-for-62). Even 
when the Heat worked free inside, Majerle and Jamal Mashburn missed 
uncontested layups. 
</P>
<P>
	``The eye doesn't lie,'' said forward P.J. Brown, spared from  
the final moments Saturday after he was ejected with 7:48 left. 
``Once you put a camera on it, there's not much you can say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy gave the Heat more credit.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Miami executed well, but at the end they missed.  
They had wide, wide open 3-point shots. Our defense was not very 
good in that respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heat coach Pat Riley has dealt with similar situations before.  
His Los Angeles Lakers were victims of the 1985 ``Mother's Day 
Massacre,'' a 148-114 loss to Boston in Game 1 of the NBA Finals. 
The Lakers recovered to win the championship in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any team that has lost the first game, you've got to deal with  
the hit,'' Riley said. ``That's the big thing. You've got to deal 
with it and move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of particular concern for the Heat is finding a way to defend  
New York's suddenly diverse offense. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than a decade, the Knicks ran many of their plays  
through Patrick Ewing. Trades for Marcus Camby and Latrell Sprewell 
were made with the idea of opening things up, but they spent a 
frustrating regular season trying to work into the flow. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing's chronic Achilles' problems forced other players to step  
up, and everything finally clicked Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	With Ewing concentrating on defense and rebounding, the Knicks  
whipped the ball around the perimeter and left Miami scrambling on 
defense. Sprewell and Allan Houston scored 22 points each and Larry 
Johnson had 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now everybody's getting a chance to shoot the ball,'' Sprewell  
said. ``It doesn't matter if it's Allen, Patrick, Larry or myself, 
we're going to go with the hot guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing scored nine points in 32 minutes, but led both teams with  
15 rebounds and blocked four shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key is not to think about him being in or him being out,''  
Houston said. ``I think he did a great job playing an all-around 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley is fond of saying a playoff series hasn't really started  
until the home team has lost. That time is here, with the Heat 
needing to win at least once in New York to bring the series back 
to Miami for Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat is 4-9 at Madison Square Garden since Riley left New  
York for South Florida. On the positive side: In each of the past 
two Miami-New York playoff meetings, the Game 1 loser has recovered 
to win the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to win two games in a row in this series,'' Van  
Gundy said. ``The team that wins has a tendency to come down in 
intensity, and the other team you know will come up in intensity. 
That's all the difference you need.''

	LA REALIDAD, Mexico (AP) -- The leader of the Zapatista rebels,  
Subcommandante Marcos, has returned to public view for the first 
time in more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcos appeared at a gathering of more than 2,000 cheering  
supporters late Saturday in La Realidad, a hamlet in a remote area 
of southern Chiapas state near the Guatemala border. With his 
trademark ski mask and pipe, Marcos delivered a speech railing 
against Mexico's political system. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zapatistas staged a brief uprising in January 1994 in the  
name of greater democracy and Indian rights. Almost immediately, 
Marcos captured the imagination of leftist intellectuals around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	But the movement has withered in recent years. Marcos --  
identified by the government as university professor Rafael 
Sebastian Guillen -- disappeared from public view, although he 
continued to issue proclamations, presumably from the jungle.

	TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) -- A group of 35 university  
students trapped in a cave for five days by flooding in southern 
Mexico were rescued Sunday, the Red Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had almost given up hope of finding the students  
alive. They had taken refuge a mile into the cave behind the 
waterfalls at Chorriadero, a tourist site in Chiapas state. 
</P>
<P>
	They were in good condition and were being taken to a hospital,  
the Red Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
	The students, from the National Polytecnical Institute in Mexico  
City, were exploring caves 35 miles from Tuxtla Gutierrez, the 
state capital, when heavy rains trapped them on Wednesday.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- The mother of an American woman serving a life  
sentence for terrorism in a Peruvian prison received a special 
Mother's Day gift Sunday -- a hug from her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time Rhoda Berenson, a physics professor at New  
York's Nassau Community College, had been allowed to touch her 
daughter Lori, 29, since Christmas. Prison officials normally keep 
them separate during visits except on special occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Berenson, a former Massachusetts Institute of  
Technology student, was convicted on Jan. 11, 1996, for helping 
leftist Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement rebels plan a thwarted 
assault on Peru's Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Her parents say she is innocent and have campaigned to have her  
freed. U.S. officials have asked Peru to give Berenson an open, 
civilian trial, arguing that a closed military trial that found her 
guilty denied her due process.

<HEADLINE> Alomar To Be Reunited With Oriole's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- All eyes will be on right field and second base  
tomorrow night at Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baltimore Orioles will make their first visit of the season,  
and that means you know who is back. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Belle, once a Cleveland fan favorite, will be roaming  
right for the first time here since signing with the Baltimore 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, who wore No. 8 and played left field for the Indians, now  
wears No. 88 and patrols right for the Orioles, but it's safe to 
say he won't go unnoticed by Cleveland fans, who have treated him 
rudely on his previous trips in. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-game series against Baltimore will also be Roberto  
Alomar's first game against his former teammates since the second 
baseman left the Orioles last November as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar spent three seasons with the Orioles (1996-98), making  
the All-Star team three times and helping the club get to the AL 
championship series twice. But last year, injuries resulted in his 
worst season since 1998 and he reportedly alienated himself from 
his teammates in the Baltimore clubhouse while playing out the 
final year of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, he said he wouldn't treat the three-game set  
differently than any other. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to play my game and put it all out on the  
field,'' he said after the Indians' 5-4 win over Tampa Bay. ``I'm 
going to treat it like it's just another game, just like it's 
another series. I still have a lot of friends on the Orioles but 
there are no hard feelings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, reunited this season with his brother, Indians catcher  
Sandy Alomar, has been everything Cleveland could have hoped for 
when the club signed him to a 4-year, $32 million contract during 
the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	After going 1-for-4 Sunday, he's batting .342 with five homers,  
19 RBIs and a team-leading 31 runs scored.

<HEADLINE> Truck With Millions of Bees Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FALMOUTH, Maine (AP) -- A truck carrying millions of bees  
overturned on a highway ramp Sunday, leaving its cargo buzzing 
around the wreckage and closing down the roadway for nearly eight 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was one big swarm of bees over the truck, like a big  
black cloud,'' said Falmouth Patrolman Edward Roberge. 
</P>
<P>
	State police said the flatbed tractor trailer turned over on its  
side around 10 a.m. while heading north along a connection between 
the Maine Turnpike and Interstate 295 in this southern Maine town. 
Equipment was brought to the site around mid-day to lift the truck 
upright. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck was carrying between 400 and 450 hives, each home to  
between 40,000 and 45,000 bees, according to Falmouth Fire Chief 
James Robertson. He estimated there were about 20 million bees on 
the truck. 
</P>
<P>
	About five firefighters were stung, one as many as five times,  
but none were seriously hurt, Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters received tips from beekeepers who heard about the  
crash. They sprayed the dumped hives with water to calm the bees as 
they loaded the hives onto another truck in the late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bees think it's raining and they won't leave the hives,''  
Roberston said.

<HEADLINE>  Tornado Survivors Worship in Tent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGE CREEK, Okla. (AP) -- The bulldozers and chain saws were  
quiet as hundreds of worshipers gathered in a donated mud-covered 
tent on Sunday for church services, almost a week after a deadly 
tornado ripped through this rural community. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of a cement-block wall was all that stood at the Ridgecrest  
Baptist Church. ``God One, Tornado Zero'' was written on a worker's 
hard hat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if God took your home, but a tornado did, and God  
will rebuild your life,'' Pastor Tom Duckett told the standing room 
only crowd. ``I know that the church is the people. A building is 
just a building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bridge Creek, a collection of two churches, a school and 8,000  
scattered residents, doesn't even appear on a map. It was here that 
a tornado started a journey Monday evening that ended with at least 
41 dead statewide. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven of the victims died in Bridge Creek.  
</P>
<P>
	The number of people missing was lowered from four to one Sunday  
when two British tourists checked in with relatives in Australia 
and a local resident was taken off the missing list when his wife 
realized he was mistakenly on it. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore, about 2,000 people  
gathered for a community-wide worship service. 
</P>
<P>
	``God will give us the strength to rebuild,'' Pastor Alan Cox of  
First Baptist Church told the Moore crowd, including Gov. Frank 
Keating and Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla. ``It's all right to cry. It's 
all right to hurt. It's all right to be confused. Hope will rebuild 
landmarks. Hope will outlive the broken hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Johns, president of Southwestern Insurance Information  
Service, said damage could top $1 billion once all the insurance 
claims have been filed. He said thousands of people have not filed 
claims yet. About 150,000 claims are expected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and 80  
college students from Missouri joined the worship in Bridge Creek. 
Duckett said members of all denominations from Catholics to Mormons 
have been helping at the church. 
</P>
<P>
	For awhile, the congregation will be tenting out, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We may be going to people's homes or in schools,'' he said.  
``We're not about a building. We're about the people inside.''

<HEADLINE> Paper: Elway Wants NFL in L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- John Elway is considering joining an effort  
to bring the NFL back to Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Times 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, 38, retired a week ago after 16 seasons in the NFL,  
capping his record-setting career with two Super Bowl 
championships. His Los Angeles-based attorney, Marvin Demoff, told 
the Times that Elway wanted to stay involved in football. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear John's interests are to be involved in the  
day-to-day operation of a football team, whether it's Denver, Los 
Angeles or someplace else in the future,'' Demoff said. ``John made 
it known to me he does not want to be a passive celebrity investor; 
he's looking to make a contribution to a team on and off the 
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billionaire developer Eli Broad and former Hollywood agent  
Michael Ovitz have separately contacted Broncos owner Pat Bowlen to 
ask for his blessing to approach Elway, the Times said. Broad and 
Ovitz head competing ownership groups vying for the NFL's 32nd 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway will meet with Broad on Tuesday in Los Angeles, but he has  
no plans to talk with Ovitz, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen offered Elway a chance to own a piece of the Broncos.  
However, Bowlen told Broad and Ovitz that it's unlikely he would be 
able to fulfill Elway's desire to work in a meaningful management 
position, according to the Times.

<HEADLINE> Africans Might Have Jewish Ancestry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Genetic tests on the Lemba people of southern  
Africa show convincing evidence the Bantu-speaking tribe may be of 
Jewish ancestry, The New York Times reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of geneticists have discovered that Lemba men carry a DNA  
sequence that is distinctive to the cohanim, a hereditary set of 
Jewish priests, the Times reported. The priests are different from 
rabbis, and perform certain ritual roles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lemba, who practice circumcision, keep one day a week holy  
and avoid eating pork or pig-like animals, have long asserted they 
are of Jewish heritage, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of the common DNA sequences stemmed from research  
being done into the Jewish tradition that priests are the 
descendants of Aaron, the elder brother of Moses. 
</P>
<P>
	An analysis of the male Y chromosome found in 1997 that a  
particular pattern of DNA changes was much more common among 
cohanim priests than among lay Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	David B. Goldstein, a population geneticist at Oxford University  
in England, took that discovery one step further. 
</P>
<P>
	``In studying the priesthood, we happened into this tool for  
distinguishing Jewish from non-Jewish populations,'' Goldstein said 
in the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike in other chromosomes, the genetic material of the Y  
chromosome remains more or less unchanged from generation to 
generation, making it a useful tool in discovering heritage, the 
newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein found a particular set of genetic mutations that was  
strongly associated with the priestly caste, not so common among 
lay Jews and very rare in non-Jewish populations. He then tested 
DNA samples collected from the Lemba. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein's research showed that the proportion of Lemba men  
carrying the genetic signature of the priests were similar to those 
found among the major Jewish populations, strongly supporting the 
Lemba tradition of Jewish ancestry, the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	And the DNA sequences were particularly common among Lemba men  
who belong to the Buba clan, the senior of their 12 groups. The 
Lemba, from South Africa and Zimbabwe, believe they were led out of 
Judea by a man named Buba. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate study, Dr. Tudor Parfitt, director of the Center  
for Jewish Studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies in 
London, said he has discovered the route the Lemba say they used to 
emigrate, saying he was told they traveled from a place called 
Senna to Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Parfitt, who has studied the Lemba for 10 years and described  
his work in a recent book, ``Journey to the Vanished City,'' said 
he found a village called Senna in Hadramawt, a former site of 
Jewish communities in Yemen. He believes that is the Senna referred 
to in Lemba tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It turned out what they are saying about themselves is  
substantially correct,'' he said.

	China Suspends Contacts With U.S.

	BEIJING (AP) -- China suspended high-level military contacts with  
the United States on Monday following the bombing of its embassy in 
Yugoslavia. The official Xinhua News Agency said consultations with 
the United States on human rights, arms control, international

<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Students held a third day of protests outside the  
U.S. and British embassies early Monday, trapping American 
diplomats inside their compound in demonstrations against NATO's 
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia. Protesters marched 
along a police-guarded route that took them past the embassies. On 
Sunday, thousands thronged past the compounds, smashing windows at 
the U.S. mission with stones and splattering its walls with paint. 
NATO and the United States have said the embassy attack was 
accidental and have expressed deep regret.

	CIA Error Blamed for Bombing Mixup  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A CIA error that was based on faulty  
information and then went undetected led to the mistaken NATO 
targeting and bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, a U.S. 
official said Sunday. The official said the intended target, the 
Yugoslav Federal Directorate of Supply and Procurement, was chosen 
by the CIA. Other organizations, including NATO, the U.S. European 
Command and the Pentagon's Joint Staff, approved it. The embassy is 
several hundred yards away from the Yugoslav government office. 
NATO and President Clinton offered further apologies Sunday for the 
bombing.

	'Wit' Wins Drama Desk Award

	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Wit,'' which has already won the Pulitzer

theater season by the Drama Desk. The Drama Desk, made up of

<HEADLINE> Pharmacies Mix a Tastier Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pharmacists are making cough syrup taste like  
pina coladas, antibiotics like coconut and liquid antacid like 
licorice sticks. 
</P>
<P>
	They're using flavorings to sweeten a bitter taste or mask  
strong medicine, making life easier for parents tired of battling 
with cranky, sick children with finicky palates. 
</P>
<P>
	Flavoring medicine is a growing business. One popular brand,  
called FLAVORx, was invented by a Washington, D.C., druggist for 
his own children. It is now available in 1,000 of the nation's 
76,000 pharmacies and that number is growing. Another drug company, 
Ascent Pediatrics of Wilmington, Mass., is developing ways to 
chemically neutralize bad tastes prior to adding flavors. 
</P>
<P>
	However, as the practice becomes more widespread, it's opening  
up a debate over safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmacists consider the droplets they put in a bottle harmless,  
and can actually help because children are more likely to take the 
full dose. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we're doing is adding flavoring. We're not changing the  
dosage or the makeup,'' said Randy Dillon, a pharmacist at Petey 
Childers Prescriptions in Independence, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration hasn't received any reports  
that flavored drugs have injured anyone, said FDA pharmacist Tom 
McGinnis. 
</P>
<P>
	But, some medical experts are concerned about a lack of federal  
oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patients are not being told that these products have never  
been tested,'' said John Perrin, professor of medicinal chemistry 
at the University of Florida, who worries that flavorings can 
dilute a drug or dangerously alter its chemical structure. ``They 
just assume that the pharmacist knows what he's doing and has 
scientific equipment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's potentially harmful any time that untested products are  
being routinely used in patients,'' said Larry Sasich, with the 
Public Citizen Health Research group, a Ralph Nader organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding flavors is part of a little-known pharmacy practice  
called compounding. Instead of just dispensing pills, the 
pharmacist customizes a drug, for instance creating a liquid form 
for patients who can't swallow pills. One decades-old practice is 
adding cherry flavor to children's medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 law is encouraging more compounding by restricting its  
regulation by the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington, D.C. pharmacist Kenneth Kramm invented FLAVORx seven  
years ago when his newborn daughter developed a seizure disorder, 
but kept spitting out her medication. So Kramm and his pharmacist 
father, Harold, began making flavor additives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was necessity,'' Kramm said. ``That's the way I guess some  
of the best things are invented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Word spread, and in October of 1995 the Kramms started marketing  
the additive to independent pharmacists. 
</P>
<P>
	FLAVORx comes in 42 flavors and costs $3 to $5 a bottle. In the  
past year, the regional drug store chains Giant Eagle of 
Pittsburgh, Giant Food of Washington, D.C., Marsh Supermarkets of 
Indiana, and Ukrop's in Richmond, Va. have begun selling it. At 
least one national chain, Rite Aid, is considering it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most popular things right now are children's  
antibiotics,'' said Randy Heiser, vice president of pharmacy for 
Giant Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
	FLAVORx is also used at several major hospitals, including San  
Diego Children's Hospital, The Cleveland Clinic and the Baptist 
Hospitals of San Antonio, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramm said he sold about $1 million worth last year. ``This year  
we're hoping to double that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	FLAVORx comes with a thick instruction book and a variety of  
flavor vials. There's cherry, chocolate, bubble gum, and grape 
along with pina colada, licorice, coconut, tangerine and 
butterscotch. 
</P>
<P>
	The recipes are fairly simple: 29 drops of grape and 12 drops of  
watermelon make a bottle of regular cough syrup taste like grape. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also available for picky pets. There is tuna flavor for  
cats, beef or liver for dogs and molasses for horses. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Peterson has been having drugs flavored at Kramm's Center  
Pharmacy for five years. Her children, Ross, 6, and Anne, 10, used 
to grimace and act like they were gagging whenever they took an 
antibiotic. 
</P>
<P>
	Flavored medicine doesn't taste like candy, she noted, but at  
least they no longer her fight her off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes my life easier and I don't feel like I'm forcing  
anything on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Perrin, of the University of Florida, points out that  
antibiotics are developed with a specific acidity. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a stability problem. Chemicals will break down in the  
water, and will become ineffective or maybe even toxic,'' Perrin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He suspects that some illnesses that doctors thought were  
resistant to antibiotics are actually being treated by drugs 
rendered useless by flavoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Acidity and stability are ``my concern too'' said the FDA's  
McGinnis. The agency is writing new regulations on pharmacist 
compounding, but McGinnis said it won't intervene unless dangerous 
ingredients are used -- and flavorings are generally considered 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kramms decided to order their own stability testing recently  
on flavored antibiotics, which ``have come out absolutely 
perfect,'' Kramm said.

<HEADLINE> Tigers' Palmer Out Indefinitely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit Tigers third baseman Dean Palmer broke  
his right thumb during today's 5-0 loss to the Baltimore Orioles 
and will be sidelined for an undetermined period. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer was injured while fielding a hard smash from Baltimore's  
Albert Belle during the third inning. The ball glanced off his 
hand, but he recovered in time and threw out Belle. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer remained in the game until the fifth, when he was  
replaced by Frank Catalanotto. Palmer was taken to a hospital for 
X-rays, which the club originally said were negative. After the 
game, Detroit announced there was a fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much treatment you can do in a situation like  
that,'' Palmer said. ``I don't expect to be out very long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer joined Detroit this season after signing a $36 million,  
five-year contract as a free agent. He's hitting .273 with five 
homers and 15 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Survivors Worship in Tent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGE CREEK, Okla. (AP) -- The bulldozers and chain saws were  
quiet as hundreds of worshipers gathered in a donated mud-covered 
tent on Sunday for church services, almost a week after a deadly 
tornado ripped through this rural community. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of a cement-block wall was all that stood at the Ridgecrest  
Baptist Church. ``God One, Tornado Zero'' was written on a worker's 
hard hat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if God took your home, but a tornado did, and God  
will rebuild your life,'' Pastor Tom Duckett told the standing room 
only crowd. ``I know that the church is the people. A building is 
just a building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bridge Creek, a collection of two churches, a school and 8,000  
scattered residents, doesn't even appear on a map. It was here that 
a tornado started a journey Monday evening that ended with at least 
41 dead statewide. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven of the victims died in Bridge Creek.  
</P>
<P>
	Two people remained missing Sunday after two British tourists,  
who had been listed as unaccounted for, checked in with relatives 
in Australia and said they had moved beyond Oklahoma when the 
tornadoes hit. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore, about 2,000 people  
gathered for a community-wide worship service. 
</P>
<P>
	``God will give us the strength to rebuild,'' Pastor Alan Cox of  
First Baptist Church told the Moore crowd, including Gov. Frank 
Keating and Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla. ``It's all right to cry. It's 
all right to hurt. It's all right to be confused. Hope will rebuild 
landmarks. Hope will outlive the broken hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Johns, president of Southwestern Insurance Information  
Service, said damage could top $1 billion once all the insurance 
claims have been filed. He said thousands of people have not filed 
claims yet. About 150,000 claims are expected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and 80  
college students from Missouri joined the worship in Bridge Creek. 
Duckett said members of all denominations from Catholics to Mormons 
have been helping at the church. 
</P>
<P>
	For awhile, the congregation will be tenting out, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We may be going to people's homes or in schools,'' he said.  
``We're not about a building. We're about the people inside.''

<HEADLINE> ValuJet Memorial Nearly Complete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK, Fla. (AP) -- Lee Sawyer returns again  
and again to a spot here in the vast liquid prairie that swallowed 
110 people in a plane choked with smoke May 11, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Her parents had boarded ValuJet Flight 592 en route to Atlanta  
with plans to attend their granddaughter's graduation from Emory 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Since November, Ms. Sawyer has watched the slow rise of a  
monument designed and built by volunteers to honor those killed. A 
dedication and memorial ceremony coinciding with the third 
anniversary of the crash will be held Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first saw it I said, 'This is perfect,''' said Ms.  
Sawyer, a teacher at an alternative public school in Miami-Dade 
County. ``I think it has very different meanings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly completed monument rests on a grassy hill a few yards  
from a levee and is visible from Tamiami Trail, a two-lane road 
that cuts east-west through the wilderness of the Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
	It consists of 110 columns of 16-inch concrete block, topped  
with four-sided pyramid shapes. It rests on a 2,450-square-foot 
triangular platform that points north toward the area where the 
DC-9 crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	The columns, each 2 feet to 8 feet tall, are set in rows divided  
by a center aisle that widens as the slope of the structure rises 
toward the south. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wanted to have a spiritual sense to the project, and  
the 110 columns were meant to represent that,'' said Francilis 
Domond, 24, one of the designers and a recent graduate of the 
University of Miami. ``Once you are in the center of the triangle, 
you (can) meditate. As you leave the site, you get the sense that 
the spirits are rising toward the heavens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some landscaping and a plaque with the names of the 105  
passengers and five crew members will be added in coming weeks, 
Domond said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several members of the American Institute of Architecture  
Students formed teams last August and held a two-day brainstorming 
session at the University of Miami to devise designs for the 
memorial. The students and a faculty member consulted with a local 
contractor and ultimately voted to refine and build one, said 
Domond. 
</P>
<P>
	A cargo shipment of 144 chemical oxygen generators ignited in  
the hold of Flight 592, sending flames tearing through the floor of 
the passenger cabin. The plane nose-dived into the murky swamp at 
460 mph, minutes after takeoff from Miami on the day before 
Mother's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the dead: five University of Miami students, including one  
architecture student. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring holidays, a crop of volunteers made up of student  
architects, mason workers and crafts workers, have spent every 
Saturday since November putting the final touches on the design. 
</P>
<P>
	``Super Bowl weekend we were out there and one of the family  
(members) of the victims on the way to the Super Bowl stopped in,'' 
said Bob Blanco, president of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers 
Local 1. ``It helped us a lot in building this thing to have these 
people come out and show us their appreciation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than $100,000 in labor, building materials and permits was  
donated by local contractors and suppliers. What wasn't donated was 
bought at cost with funds from the United Way charity, which 
donated up to $25,000, Blanco said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of a horrible tragedy comes good,'' said Ms. Sawyer, who  
has kept relatives of others killed in the crash informed of the 
memorial's progress and taken a bulletin board worth of photos at 
the site. ``I'm lucky because I get to go out there whenever I 
want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domond recalled seeing Ms. Sawyer visit the construction site  
one day in February -- her dead father's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She asked us where two columns were going to be together, and  
she laid flowers and balloons on the foundation where the columns 
were erected later,'' Domond said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One weekend a couple who lost their son, a newlywed, came by  
and offered to buy us lunch,'' he said. ``Every time we saw a 
family member it felt really good.''

	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A woman who said she was enraged that her  
8-year-old daughter wet her pants was charged Sunday with beating 
the girl to death with a baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
	Anita Simmons, 36, told investigators she hit the girl eight or  
nine times on the head and shoulders Saturday morning. Six siblings 
also were home at the time.

got home shortly before midnight, at least 13 hours later,

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Differed in Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley might seem like two  
peas in a pod -- free-trading Democrats both wonkish and wooden. 
Just don't get them started on daylight savings time and highway 
billboards. 
</P>
<P>
	Now competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in  
2000, Gore and Bradley were colleagues in the Senate. As members of 
the same party, the junior senator from Tennessee and senior 
senator from New Jersey voted alike on more than three-quarters of 
all roll-call votes, according to an Associated Press analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	But compared side by side, their voting records reveal some  
fundamental differences on issues foreign and domestic. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was more willing than Gore to expand use of the death  
penalty. Gore, but not Bradley, supported an international space 
station and a space-based missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley favored fewer U.S. troops in Europe but grudgingly voted  
to fund Nicaraguan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore voted to confirm President Reagan's nomination of Alan  
Greenspan as Federal Reserve chairman and President Bush's 
nomination of David Souter to the Supreme Court. Bradley was one of 
two dissenters on Greenspan, questioning his international 
experience, and one of nine dissenters on Souter, questioning his 
position on abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
	As for daylight-savings time, Bradley supported a move in 1986  
to change the ``spring ahead'' from the last Sunday to the first 
Sunday in April. Supporters of the measure said an extra hour of 
light at night would conserve energy, fight crime and help 
business. Opponents like Gore favored an hour of light in the early 
morning, when children leave for school. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a 1987 debate that pitted business against  
environmentalists, Gore helped derail limits on highway billboards 
that Bradley supported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate took 2,722 roll-call votes during the eight years  
Bradley and Gore served together -- from 1985, when Gore joined the 
Senate, until 1993, when Gore became vice president. In 585 of the 
roll calls, at least one of them did not vote, according to the AP 
analysis of vote tallies compiled by Congressional Quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bradley and Gore both cast votes or announced how they  
would have voted, they were on the same side 1,693 times, or on 79 
percent of the roll calls. They differed on the other 444 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutgers University political scientist Ross Baker said the  
aggregate numbers suggest Bradley and Gore are more alike than 
different. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not exactly joined at the hip, but they're certainly  
fraternal twins,'' Baker said. He estimated that the most 
ideologically aligned senators vote alike 80 percent to 90 percent 
of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said Friday that he and Gore have ``a lot of  
differences'' on issues and pledged to explore them in the fall. He 
said he tackled complex issues in the Senate, like international 
trade, international finance and taxation, while Gore was ``more 
cautious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said the vice president ``has a very  
long and distinguished record both in the House and the Senate on 
issues like the environment, high-tech, family policy and community 
empowerment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many votes that divided Bradley and Gore were variations on  
basic philosophical differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley voted numerous times to cut agricultural subsidy  
programs such as those for sugar, honey and peanuts, while Gore 
favored keeping the programs in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, Bradley supported attempts to transfer money  
from the international space station to veterans hospitals, urban 
development, clean-water programs, other science programs and 
deficit reduction. Each time, Gore supported keeping the money at 
NASA for the space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Gore, Bradley became a convert to American military  
involvement in Central America. He voted ``with misgivings and 
reservations'' in 1986 to send $100 million to the Contra rebels in 
Nicaragua, one of only 11 Democrats to vote with President Reagan. 
In 1987, Bradley opposed a congressional prohibition on introducing 
U.S. troops into Honduras or Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore voted to authorize use of military force against Iraq in  
1991; Bradley voted for a resolution urging continued sanctions and 
diplomatic efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore consistently supported the Strategic Defense Initiative  
while Bradley, at every opportunity, voted against SDI, the mobile 
MX missile and B-2 stealth bombers. Bradley also supported efforts 
to reduce American military overseas and to consider closing 
domestic military bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore defended ceilings on the federal deficit, while Bradley  
often favored increasing domestic spending in areas like 
environmental protection and education. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Bradley and Gore both say they support the death penalty,  
they differed in several instances on how it is applied. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley supported imposing the death penalty for certain  
drug-related crimes, for drug kingpins, and in the case of killings 
during crimes that violate the Civil Rights Act; Gore voted no in 
each case. In 1991, Bradley supported a move to impose the federal 
death penalty in the case of crimes committed with guns that had 
been transported across state borders.

<HEADLINE> Monica Pops Up on 'Saturday Night' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Live from New York, it's ... Monica Lewinsky.  
</P>
<P>
	The former White House intern poked fun at President Clinton and  
her ex-friend, Linda Tripp, during an appearance on the NBC comedy 
series ``Saturday Night Live.'' One skit had Ms. Lewinsky living in 
a Malibu beach house with ex-President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	She was also in a second segment, dispensing advice on phone sex  
and affairs with older men along with actor Tim Meadows, who 
portrays a '70s style ``ladies' man'' conducting a telephone 
call-in show. 
</P>
<P>
	The Malibu beach house was actually depicted as Clinton's dream.  
Actor Darrell Hammond, who impersonates Clinton, wears a white 
bathrobe and is tempted by an offer of a lunch date with two 
prostitutes by Meadows, playing Vernon Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky, dressed all in black, enters the beach house after  
coming home from work. Clinton asks how her day went. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone gets so mad at me when I turn the wrong letters,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton tries to make her feel better with a gift -- a copy of  
``Leaves of Grass'' by Walt Whitman. Ms. Lewinsky points out that 
he's given her that book before. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky balks at Clinton's request to have lunch with  
Jordan. ``Come on, baby,'' he said. ``Don't you trust me?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, in your dreams, you big creep,'' Ms. Lewinsky replied,  
echoing the nickname she gave Clinton in tape recordings of her 
conversations with Linda Tripp. 
</P>
<P>
	Meadows introduces Ms. Lewinsky during the second skit as  
someone ``who has done more to educate this country in the ways of 
love than anybody else on this planet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky tells one advice-seeker that it's not a good idea  
to have an affair with her much older boss. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, people in the office will start gossiping,'' she said,  
``and the next thing you know your face is all over Arabic 
newspapers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another caller wanted to know if she should have phone sex. ``I  
had phone sex with this one guy,'' Ms. Lewinsky said. ``His name 
doesn't really matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't we just call him William Howard Taft?'' Meadows  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor John Goodman, who has portrayed Tripp in past shows,  
called in to ask whether Ms. Lewinsky could forgive her. ``No 
way,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC had tried to keep Ms. Lewinsky's appearance on the show a  
secret. But word slipped out when she was seen during the week in 
the ``Saturday Night Live'' studio in Rockefeller Center for 
rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
	The night's best Clinton joke, however, came during the  
``Weekend Update'' news report narrated by Colin Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you get when you cross Joey Buttafuoco with a college  
education?'' Quinn asked. 
</P>
<P>
	A picture of Clinton, smiling with his thumbs up, appeared on  
the screen behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``And you know he's watching tonight,'' Quinn said, after the  
laughter died down.

<HEADLINE> Skydiving Plane Crashes, Kills 6 </HEADLINE>

	CELINA, Ohio (AP) -- Five skydivers and a pilot died Sunday when  
their plane apparently lost power after takeoff and crashed in a 
soybean field, authorities and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened about 6 p.m., south of Celina at Montezuma  
Lake Field Airport, according to the State Highway Patrol. The six 
occupants, five men and a woman, were dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Dairy farmer Charles Schwieterman was taking a break from the  
afternoon milking when he heard the plane overhead, about a mile 
from the runway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he was in trouble right away,'' said Schwieterman,  
61. ``He seemed like he wasn't getting anywhere. It seemed like he 
didn't have any power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The engine started sputtering, then ``clonked completely out,''  
Schwieterman said. He saw one skydiver jump out but the person's 
chute opened only partway, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plane went into half a turn and went straight down head  
first,'' said Schwieterman, the first person to reach the downed 
airplane. He found at least three bodies lying outside the plane, 
which landed in a soybean field owned by a neighboring farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwieterman said people skydive from the airport almost every  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims' names have been withheld pending the notification  
of their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating. The  
National Transportation Safety Board is expected on the scene 
Monday, the patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
	Celina is 27 miles southwest of Lima in west-central Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Cal, Hunger Strikers Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Six protesters ended an eight-day hunger  
strike Saturday when the University of California, Berkeley, agreed 
to retain eight ethnic studies professorships. 
</P>
<P>
	The school also will provide $100,000 toward an institute of  
race and gender studies, open a multicultural student center and 
commission an ethnic studies mural. 
</P>
<P>
	Students began a liquid-only diet on April 30, claiming  
administrators had cut funding to the ethnic studies department. On 
Tuesday, police arrested some 80 protesters who had set up a 
makeshift camp outside the office of Chancellor Robert Berdahl. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the hunger strikers had to be treated for dehydration and  
an irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Berdahl said the agreement proves the university's commitment to  
its ethnic studies program.
