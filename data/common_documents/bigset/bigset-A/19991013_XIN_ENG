<HEADLINE> Most Canadian Schools Reported to Have Internet Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Nine out of 10 elementary,
intermediate and secondary schools in Canada have internet access
while students are still in great need of computers, software and
well trained teachers, Canadian media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, all schools are
connected to the Internet while, on average, about one third of
elementary and intermediate students and half of all secondary
students are using e-mail.
</P>
<P>
Computers are more available to students in higher grades with
an average of one computer for seven students at the secondary
level, one for eight at the intermediate level and one for nine at
the elementary level, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Mathematics is most likely to be a subject being taught by
means of instructional software, the report said, adding about 87
percent of elementary pupils are learning their math through such
software.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, about 64 percent of students use software for
geography and 56 percent use it for primary language instruction.
</P>
<P>
Despite the major strides in bringing their students online,
the report said, schools are going short of computers, software
and well trained teachers.
</P>
<P>
Most principals said they need more computers and more time for
teachers to prepare computer and Internet courses.
</P>
<P>
Teachers are also in need of training to upgrade their computer
knowledge and skills, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Takes Pride in Winning of Nobel Prize by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Tuesday voiced its pride
in the winning of the Nobel Prize for chemistry by an Egyptian
scientist for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Prime Minister Atef Ebeid
sent separate cables of congratulation to Ahmad Zoweil after he
was honored in the day by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences
for his "pioneering role in a revolution in chemistry by
demonstrating that a rapid laser technique can observe the motion
of atoms in a molecule as they occur during a chemical reaction."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak expressed his pride in the cable that "one of Egypt's
exemplary sons has been honored by the international community,"
wishing Zoweil further success, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"It is an honor," Minister of Information Safwat el-Sherif said
in remarks carried by the news agency.
</P>
<P>
"Every Egyptian takes pride
that one of the sons of Egypt has risen to this world standard as
a prominent scientist in a most specialized science," he said.
</P>
<P>
"By winning the Nobel Prize, Zoweil has set an example for
youth that the way of science is the way which brings benefits to
humanity and glory to its maker," el-Sherif added.
</P>
<P>
Zoweil, who holds both Egyptian and United States citizenship,
has held the Linus Pauling chair of chemical physics at the
California Institute of Technology since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences honored him for his
pioneering investigation of fundamental chemical reactions, using
ultra-short laser flashes, on the time scale on which the
reactions actually occur.
</P>
<P>
The academy said Zoweil's work in the late 1980s led to the
birth of femtochemistry, the use of high-speed cameras to monitor
chemical reactions at a scale of femtoseconds, or
0.000000000000001 second.

<HEADLINE> Over 50% Households Connected to Cable Television in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 50 percent of
Romanian households are connected to cable television, whose
expansion is ''spectacular'', the official Rompres news agency
reported on Tuesday citing local analysts as saying.
</P>
<P>
The subscribers' number to the cable television has continually
soared since 1992, when the cable television was set in place. The
most significant increase in the subscribers number took place
after 1996 when hundreds of thousands were registered per year,
according to the Romanian Professional Association for Cable
Communications.
</P>
<P>
As a result, cable television is becoming a profitable
business. "The net profit of cable television firms was of about
25 percent of the turnover", the association calculated, adding
that a Romanian firm with 10,000 subscribers has practically a
monthly turnover of 30,000 U.S. dollars and its net profit is
7,500 U.S. dollars. Big firms such as the Astral TV group or the
RCS have hundreds of thousands of subscribers and monthly
turnovers of millions of dollars.

<P>
NAIROBI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea insisted on Tuesday
that its territorial disputes with Ethiopia, including the areas
of Zalanbessa, should be solved on the basis of colonial treaties.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean Presidential Spokesperson Yemane Ghebremeskel made the
remarks in response to the Monday's Ethiopian Foreign Ministry's
statement demanding Eritrea to "withdraw from all Ethiopian
territories that it has occupied by force".
</P>
<P>
Yemane, also the presidential advisor, said "Eritrea shall
redeploy from disputed areas including Zalanbessa, that it has
moved into after fighting on May 6, 1998. Ethiopia will do
likewise in areas it moved into after february 1999."
</P>
<P>
Eritrea officially accepted the proposal on Technical
Arrangements by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in early
August and pledged its full cooperation with the OAU in
implementing the three agreements -- Framework Agreement, the
Modalities and Technical Arrangements.
</P>
<P>
However, Ethiopia has so far not signed the Technical
Arrangements, describing them as unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Armed conflicts broke out between the two Horn of African
neighbors in early May 1998. Tens of thousands of people were
killed or wounded in the 16-month border conflicts.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Aid to Yugoslavia Should Be Monitored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Tuesday that it is discussing ways with its allies to monitor aid
programs to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
When the European Union (EU) was considering "different ideas
for assistance in the form of heating oil," the United States was
concerned, State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"Let me emphasize 'concerns'-- that we not pursue a program
that could directly or indirectly support the regime, and that it
might be difficult to monitor how heating oil is used, who gets
the heating oil, and where it goes," Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
After the war in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, the U.S.
vowed not provide a single cent to reconstruction of Yugoslavia so
long as Slobodan Milosevic remains leader of the country.
</P>
<P>
"So we are discussing with them (U.S. allies) ways to monitor
the program, to control how it's used, to have confidence that the
heating oil is going to the right purpose so that the unintended
effect of assisting the regime doesn't happen," Rubin noted.
</P>
<P>
Washington pledged it would strongly support the opposition in
Yugoslavia and agreed to provide some pure humanitarian
assistance.
</P>
<P>
"We have provided and have made available some $12 million in
funds directly to assist the opposition and free press and labor
organizations, et cetera," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin stressed the tough policy against Belgrade. "We have been
and will continue to be supporters of providing humanitarian
assistance to Serbia... But we don't want money spent on
reconstruction, and we don't want money to go directly to support
the regime."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Debates Nuclear Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate on Tuesday
was debating the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on nuclear weapons
as the administration requested a vote be postponed.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is scheduled to vote late Tuesday or early on
Wednesday on the treaty, but behind the debate, the Republicans
and Democrats are still negotiating for a a political settlement
to postpone the vote.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the Senate will reject a nuclear test ban treaty,
President Bill Clinton Monday formally asked the Senate to
postpone a vote on the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing there would be no enough votes for the approval of
the treaty, Clinton said: "Accordingly, I request that you
postpone consideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on the
Senate floor."
</P>
<P>
"I believe that proceeding to a vote under these circumstances
would severely harm the national security of the United States,
damage our relationship with our allies, and undermine our
historic leadership over 40 years...in reducing the nuclear
threat," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
However, the White House refused the demands by the Republicans
that he not bring the matter up again for the rest of his White
House tenure.
</P>
<P>
The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on nuclear weapons have been
signed by 154 countries and ratified by 26 countries since it was
open to signature in 1996. But it takes effect only after it gets
approval from all the 44 members of the Conference on Disarmament.

ADDIS ABABA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Population Fund (UNPF) has predicted that by 2050 the population
of Ethiopia will be up to 170 million, making the Horn of Africa
country the 9th most populous nation in the world.
</P>
<P>
The UNPF made the announcement on the occasion of the "Day of
the Six Billion" which was set for October 12 by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency reported that three new babies born
here right after midnight have been given special birth
certificates and presents to mark the world population day.
</P>
<P>
Nigussie Tefera, head of the Ethiopian National Office of
Population, said on the occasion that to bear a child is to take a
responsibility so that new borns could get food, clothing,
education and be in healthy environment.
</P>
<P>
One of the challenges to Ethiopia is to provide the public with
 effective contraceptives and medical personnel for the
implementation of the designed population policy for family
planning, Nigussie said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Ethiopia's annual population growth rate
has dropped to 2.9 percent in recent years from 3.2 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat Tuesday called on the European Union
(EU) to play a greater role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a joint press conference with visiting
Italian President Carlo Azegilo Ciampi after talks in the West
Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Describing the talks as very significant, positive and
constructive, Arafat said that they discussed bilateral ties and
ways of activating the EU role, especially that of Italy, in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We are in need of greater EU role in the peace process,"
Arafat said, adding that the EU special envoy to the Middle East,
Miguel Moratinos, has been closely following up the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The PNA chairman downplayed the latest dispute with Israel over
the release of Palestinian prisoners, saying that the situation
did not constitute a crisis and serious efforts were being made to
settle the problem.
</P>
<P>
Israel postponed the release of 151 Palestinian prisoners
scheduled for last Friday under the terms of a latest
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement after a rift emerged on which
intimates should be freed.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also urged the Israeli government to form its
negotiating team in the final status talks, which will deal with
such thorny issues as the Palestinian statehood, final borders,
refugees and the fate of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The two sides launched a ceremonial start of the talks on
September 13, but Israel has yet to finalize the list of its
negotiators. The Palestinians accused Israel of foot-dragging.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ciampi reiterated the support of Italian
government and the people for the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Ciampi's visit is part of a regional tour that has taken him to
Israel, where he held talks with Prime Minister Ehud Barak on
Monday.

"The situation is clearly fluid in Pakistan and it is clear

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Resists Calls For Probe on KGB Archive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema Tuesday resisted opposition calls for an inquiry into a
dossier naming some 261 people alleged to have been approached by
or spied for the KGB up till the end of the '80s.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema pointed out that the Parliament's massacres and
terrorist crimes commission list, to which the dossier was handed
over Monday, was already a commission of inquiry so it made no
sense setting up another one.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had acted with the utmost "transparency"
in giving the dossier first to the judiciary - which is itself
investigating any possible wrongdoing - and then to the
commission.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said the Italian public would draw its own conclusions.
</P>
<P>
What he regretted, he said, was that the affair appeared to
have plunged Italy back into a Cold War climate of conservatives
against once and current Communists.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema was keen to stress that the dossier, compiled by ex-KGB
archivist Vasili Mitrokhin and given to British intelligence in
1992, was not "a list of spies" but a series of reports on events
in which information may have been sought or given even without
the person being aware of it.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema was adamant that the dossier would have no effect on
the government despite calls from some in opposition, repeated
Tuesday, for its resignation because of the presence in the
dossier of the leader of one of the government parties, Armando
Cossutta of the unreconstructed Italian Communists.

<P>
KAMPALA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- With the security guarantees
from the belligerents in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
the United Nations peacekeepers can step in to monitor the peace
process at anytime.
</P>
<P>
Rashid Lallali, chairman of the Joint Military Commission, made
these remarks here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After the closing ceremony of the Joint Military Commission
meeting in Ugandan capital Kampala on Tuesday evening, the
Algerian general told Xinhua that his commission will try to
create the best conditions for the United Nations personnel.
</P>
<P>
"Since the forces who used to fight each other now turn into
partners, the security of the U.N. peace-keepers would be
guaranteed," Lallali said.
</P>
<P>
"All the forces gave their positions in the DRC and there is no
 contested area in the region. You can expect unanimous support
from all parties," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the general appealed for more fund to facilitate the
 implementation of the cease-fire in the vast central African
country.
</P>
<P>
Despite contributions from Zambia, Uganda and the Organization
of African Unity, the Joint Military Commission is still
fund-strapped, he pointed out.

ceremony of the meeting that Uganda would contribute 100,000 U.S.
dollars to the commission to facilitate the implementation of the
Lusaka cease-fire agreement.

<HEADLINE> S. African NGOs Reject AIDS Notification Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Government plans to make
AIDS a notifiable disease were Tuesday overwhelmingly rejected by
non- governmental organizations (NGOs) in parliamentary hearings,
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The NGOs said that instead of giving the Health Department
better statistics on the disease, notification would drive it
deeper underground, place an impossible administrative burden on
doctors, and expose women in particular to greater abuse.
</P>
<P>
Parliament's health portfolio committee was hearing
presentations on the department's draft regulations published for
comment in April this year but put on hold pending a review of all
AIDS programs.
</P>
<P>
The regulations, if adopted, will force health care workers to
notify health authorities when they diagnose an AIDS case -- but
not give the individual's name -- and also tell the person's
immediate family and other care givers.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Women's Legal Center in Cape Town, Michelle
O'Sullivan, told the committee that the regulations should be
"abandoned", and that the department should focus on other ways of
obtaining data and stopping the spread of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
She said women as a group were already seen in communities as
the carriers of HIV and AIDS, and many women whose status became
known to others suffered direct violence at the hands of their
partners, family or community.
</P>
<P>
Many women who had been raped chose not to tell their families
or partners either that they had been raped, or were going for HIV
testing, because they feared the stigma and violence from their
partners.
</P>
<P>
They might be less inclined to go for testing if they knew
their families were to be told.
</P>
<P>
"We need to encourage people to go for HIV testing," she said.
But this (notification) is not the way to go about it, she added.
</P>
<P>
Zackie Achmat of the Treatment Action Campaign said
notifiability was unconstitutional on the grounds of dignity and
privacy, and would be a misuse of scarce resources.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Health Department should take the lead in a
campaign to promote voluntary testing as part of a campaign for
openness about HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
One problem was that the state did not have the resources in
place for such a campaign.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the clinics in South Africa did not offer HIV
 testing.
</P>
<P>
Mark Heywood of the AIDS Law Project noted that although one of
the aims of the regulations was to prevent the disease spreading,
there was no requirement that an infected person's sexual partner
should be notified.
</P>
<P>
The project's concern was that these issues were being dealt
with in a climate of substantial violence and discrimination
against people with HIV.
</P>
<P>
There was a real danger that people with HIV or AIDS, knowing
they would not be guaranteed confidentiality, would not go for
testing, counseling or care.
</P>
<P>
If mandatory disclosure had this effect, "then I would suggest
it needs to be reconsidered", he said.
</P>
<P>
Heywood also said that making AIDS, rather than HIV,
notifiable, would merely give a picture of trends in the HIV
epidemic eight to ten years ago, and would be of little help in
improving prevention now.
</P>
<P>
Internationally, the current trend was towards HIV, not AIDS,
reporting, which gave more time to plan for the disease's impact
on health and care facilities.
</P>
<P>
"Sentinel" surveillance at particular sites, such as hospitals,
could be designed to give more accurate, cost effective and useful
information on the disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
Acting Director-General of the Health Department, Harm
Pretorius, who sat in on the hearings, said afterwards that it
would be premature to say now whether the regulations would be
scrapped or amended.
</P>
<P>
He said the department would weigh up Tuesday's presentations,
along with the general comments it had received after the
regulations were published, before making any decision.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Govt. Urged to Withdrawal from Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's economists Tuesday
challenged the government to redirect budgetary resources away
from defense into the ailing health sector and education, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on behalf of the business community and
Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce, economist Eric Bloch said
that he could not understand why Zimbabweans should suffer while
billions of dollars were being spent in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
"It is incomprehensible and inconceivable that Zimbabwe should
spend billions of dollars waging a war more than 2,000 kilometers
away from its borders, " Bloch said at the two-day pre-budget
seminar for parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
"We can only spend what we have," the economist said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe doesn't provide the health system with the funding
necessary to pay health professionals or the funding required to
supply health facilities with state-of-the-art life-saving
equipment, medication and food, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Economist John Makamure accused Zimbabwean government ministers
of not treating the national budget as a binding document.
</P>
<P>
He said year after year people are asked to make proposals
which are never incorporated in the final budget.
</P>
<P>
"There is that question of failure by the executive to treat
the budget seriously. There is a serious mis-allocation of
resources in Zimbabwe," said Makamure.
</P>
<P>
He called for reduction of ministries to 16 from the current
26.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the government to provide more funding to the
National Investment Trust to make it more effective and thereby
speeding up the indigenization of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa told the seminar
Monday that measures which were taken to improve the financing of
the 1999 budget failed.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate to report that despite the impressive
performance of our revenues during the year, this revenue was
surpassed by social and development expenditure demands," he said.

<HEADLINE> No U.S. Role in Trial of Saudi Bomb Suspect: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A Saudi official has ruled
out possible U.S. intervention in the trial of Hani El-Sayegh, a
Saudi national suspected of getting involved in a 1996 bomb attack
in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
El-Sayegh will be tried by Saudi authorities without
U.S. intervention, Saudi ambassador to the United States Prince
Bandar Ibn Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz Al-Saud said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Such affairs concern the Saudi security authorities, and
neither the Americans nor any other party should meddle in the
prosecution," said Prince Bandar, who is on a two-day visit to
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He added that Sayegh will be subjected to prosecution according
to the standing legislation and under the Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Interior Minister Nayef Bin Abdul-Aziz announced in
Riyadh Monday that Sayegh, who was held in the U.S., has been
handed over to Saudi authorities.
</P>
<P>
Sayegh was suspected of getting involved in the bombing of the
Khobar Towers residential complex in eastern Saudi Arabia on June
25, 1996. The explosion destroyed the complex that housed U.S. air
force personnel stationed at the Saudi Dhahran air base.
</P>
<P>
Sayegh unsuccessfully sought asylum in the U.S., arguing
he would probably be tortured if he returned to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
He was deported to the U.S. from Canada in 1997 after he
reached an agreement with U.S. prosecutors to cooperate in the
investigation of the blast.

<HEADLINE> Former KGB Man: Italy's Spy List "Forgery" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A veteran Russian spy on Tuesday
dismissed as "absolute forgery" an alleged list of Soviet spies
published in Italy, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant Colonel Leonid Kolosov, who spied for the former
Soviet Union in Italy from 1962 to 1973 under the cover of a
reporter for the Soviet daily Izvestia, said he had interviewed
some of the people identified in the "Mitrokhin dossier," and that
"they were ordinary people who had nothing to do with the KGB at
all," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the list includes "about 150 names, and that is too
many for any one country," Kolosov said.
</P>
<P>
"Such a number is an absurdity obvious to any professional,"
Kolosov said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service has declined
to comment to the reported spy list, saying that making such
comments was not normal practice for any state's intelligence or
security services, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Better Treatment for Developing Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- China said Tuesday that
the best way of accelerating the speed of poverty reduction in
developing countries is a better treatment by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Protectionism should be reduced against products from
developing countries and financial assistance and technology
transfer to them should be increased, Deputy Chinese Permanent
Representative to the United Nations Shen Guofang told the U.N.
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He said only in this way can these countries strengthen
capacity building and obtain equal participation in the
formulation of rules of game, including rules for the prevention
of financial risks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the implementation of the First U.N. Decade for the
Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006), Shen said poverty eradication
measures should be taken according to the concerns of the
recipient countries.
</P>
<P>
"A one-size-fits-all" policy will not work and may even be
counter-productive, Shen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The First U.N. Decade of Poverty Eradication was proclaimed in
1995 with an aim to eradicate absolute poverty and reduce overall
poverty substantially in the world by 2006.
</P>
<P>
Despite the countless programs and campaigns waged against
poverty across regions, it continues to be a major impedment to
human development and economic progress.
</P>
<P>
Half of the world's six billion people are still mired in
poverty, trying to eke out a living on 2 U.S. dollars a day or
less, according to a U.N. report released recently.
</P>
<P>
The majority of poor people live in rural areas of developing
countries while poverty is also widespread in urban areas and
significant in some industrialized societies.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Tuesday expressed serious concern
over a coup attempt now underway in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran is closely watching the ongoing developments in the
neighboring Pakistan with serious concern, the Islamic Republic
News Agency quoted Asefi as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran attaches great significance to Pakistan and
hopes to see that peace and security is swiftly restored in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani troops on Tuesday surrounded the office of Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif and announced the "dismissal" of the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The coupists, now in effect in control of the capital
Islamabad, took over the state radio and television, and arrested
Information Minister Mushahid Hussain, a close ally to Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani army troops took actions about two and half
hours after Prime Minister Sharif announced to sack the army
chief Pervaiz Musharraf.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Tuesday brought world's attention to the challenge
of growing population as the planet greeted the 6 billionth
citizen.
</P>
<P>
The world is being transformed by a population growth that has
seen the total population double within four decades with half the
globe's population today under 25 and a billion young people
between 15 and 24, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when greeting the birth of a baby boy at a
hospital in Sarajevo on the Day of Six Billion. A copy of his
statement was released at the U.N. headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said the challenge to feed, clothe and house
this great mass of humanity over the next decades will be immense
as nearly three fifths of the 4.8 billion people in developing
countries lack basic sanitation.
</P>
<P>
Almost a third of them have no access to clean water and a
quarter do not have adequate housing and a fifth have no access to
modern health services, he added.

<P>
OTTAWA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A transbordr wildlife corridor
of 6 million hectares is being planned by the Canadian Parks and
Wilderness Society.
</P>
<P>
The "A-to-A project" is to link the land mass between Ontario's
Algonquin Provincial Park and Adirondack Park in New York,
Canadian media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The initiative is being pursued to protect the "ecological
integrity" of the two large parks, populated with wolves, bears,
moose lynx and other mammals, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Harvey Locke, vice-president of conservation for the society,
was quoted as describing the project as part of the efforts "to
maintain connections between the two parks so they don't become
islands, because islands become islands of extinction."
</P>
<P>
The plan, still in its infancy, targets the geographical region
known as the Frontenac Axis, a strip of hard Canadian Shield that
remains relatively untouched by development of agriculture, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Reppas: Greece Expects Tangible Proof From Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Greece expected from Turkey a
tangible response proving that there was progress and good will for
the improvement of the relations between the two neighboring
countries, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Reppas said that Turkey was
subject to the same criteria as all other countries that are
candidates for the European Union (EU) membership but there were
issues of particular Greek interest such as the Cyprus issue and
Cyprus's accession to the EU and the level of Greek-Turkish
relations.
</P>
<P>
He noted Greece wanted Turkey to win a real and not fictional
accession into the EU but in order for all these to happen,
certain preconditions and terms must be met.
</P>
<P>
As an advocate of the EU's enlargement, Greece had no objection
to stepping up the pace of negotiations with candidate countries,
but the rules could not be bent and must be valid for all, he
said.
</P>
<P>
As for Monday's message by Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
to his Turkish counterpart, Bulent Ecevit, Reppas said that
Simitis said in the message that Greece had contributed to the
creation of a positive climate in Greek-Turkish relations and had
taken specific steps vis-a-vis Ankara, therefore, it expected
reciprocal action in bilateral relations and over Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman hoped that talks in Cyprus would start soon
without preconditions and all sides had to show a willingness for
the Cypriot problem to be resolved.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Calls for Eradication of Urban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Positive changes in the urban
economy must benefit the poor, a senior United Nations official
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Imbalance in the distribution of resources such as shelter,
infrastructure, land, finance, safe and affordable transport,
education, employment and health must be readdressed, " said Klaus
Toepfer, acting executive director of the U.N. Center for Human
Settlements (Habitat).
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech at an international meeting on urban
poverty, Toepfer said that as people welcome the six-billionth
baby, the major concern is that about a quarter of of the babies
will be born in a slum to a family without basic services and grow
up in terrible poverty.
</P>
<P>
The Third Meeting of the International Forum on Urban Poverty
held here from October 12 to 14 was aimed at finding new ways to
eradicate urban poverty.
</P>
<P>
The eradication of urban poverty has become the focus of the
Habitat, the U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
The Habitat has already developed poverty reduction programs in
a number of countries including Bangladesh, Cote d'Ivoire,
Madagascar, Morocco and the Sudan, he added.
</P>
<P>
About 200 delegates from various governments, local
authorities, international aid agencies and non-governmental
organizations attended the three-day conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference is expected to discuss four main topics, namely
informal cities and security of tenure, urban safety for the poor
and crime prevention, the utilization of transport systems and
urban children and youth in poverty.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Proposes Steps to Improve Prospects of All Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- On the day statisticians
estimate the world's six billionth child will be born, the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said on Tuesday that the child's
chances of surviving to adulthood are at risk.
</P>
<P>
"We do not know where or when the six billionth baby will be
born or whether he or she will be rich or poor, UNICEF"s Executive
Director Carol Bellamy said. "But the overwhelming odds are the
six billionth child will be born poor. And we know that in the
poorest countries one in three children will not even live beyond
the age of five, much less attain adulthood."
</P>
<P>
According to Bellamy, such odds are completely unacceptable in
a world where almost every nation has ratified the Convention on
the Rights of the Child, which states that all children have the
right to basic health and education as well as protection from the
ravages of war, hazardous labour and sexual exploitation.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF said to improve the prospects of the six billionth
child, a broad swath of interventions are needed, including to
close the widening between rich and poor, address the growing
peril of armed conflicts, fulfil the basic right of all children
to adequate nutrition, reduce child mortality, level the playing
field so that girls have the same opportunities as boys, bring
illiteracy to an end, end violence against girls and women, reduce
early pregnancies, eliminate hazardous child labour, stop the
mistreatment of minorities and conduct a global campaign against
HIV/AIDS.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Situation in Angola Very Worrying: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The AIDS situation in Angola is
"very worrying" despite the small number of patients registered by
the sanitary authorities, the Angolan National AIDS Program said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Director of the program Dulcelina Serrano told the press that
all factors in favor of the spreading of AIDS can be found in
Angola, such as the augmentation of prostitution, poverty, the
lack of education and information about the danger of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The sanitary authorities registered only 5,012 AIDS cases from
1985 to August, 1999, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
But the estimated number of the existing AIDS cases in the
southern African country with a population of 10 million is some
36,000, except 31, 000 dead of the disease and some 250,000
carriers of the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
Serrano said that her organization has no money for resolving
all the problems. But she noted that with the help of the
international community, the National AIDS Program has distributed
preventives to hospitals and non- government organizations, which
are responsible for giving them to the target groups.
</P>
<P>
These preventives, however, have been found on sales in black
markets, at the price of two million readjusted kwanza per unit,
said Serrano, adding that it means that the preventives have not
been distributed to the people in need.
</P>
<P>
Serrano accused the African politicians of being insensible of
the danger of AIDS, saying that in 1997, the allocation by African
countries accounted for only one-tenth of the total 150 million
U.S. dollars, for supporting programs on AIDS in the African
continent.

<HEADLINE> UK Prices Remain Flat in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 12 (Xinhua) - UK inflation remained unchanged
in September and fell below the government's 2.5 percent target
for the sixth month in a row, according to official statistics
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Office of National Statistics (ONS) reported that the
broad retail price index was 1.1 percent higher than a year ago,
the same annual rise as in August.
</P>
<P>
The figure means that next year's increase in pensions and
social security payments - which are calculated with reference to
the previous September's headline rate - will be just 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
With headline inflation still at a 36-year low and underlying
inflation comfortably below the Government's target, the latest
figures will be cited as evidence by industry and unions in their
calls for the Bank of England not to raise interest rates again.
</P>
<P>
While the data appear benign, economists here pointed to the
3.6 percent annualized rise in service sector costs as evidence
that parts of the economy are still booming and threaten to
unleash inflationary prices going forward.
</P>
<P>
Most of them are expecting the Bank to recommend another
increase in the cost of borrowing before the end of the year.

received its rule-making powers under the Financial Services and
Markets Bill.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the publication, Howard Davies, Chairman of the FSA,
said: "The Principles for Businesses will stand at the pinnacle of
the new FSA Handbook of Rules and Guidance. They will be a key
element in building a regulatory system."
</P>
<P>
Beneath the Principles there will be binding rules, evidential
provisions and guidance. Collectively these will be the flesh on
the bones of the Principles themselves, according to the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
The meaning and impact of the Principles will be clarified both
in the supervisory dialogue between the FSA and regulated firms
and in the more detailed material outlined in the Handbook.
</P>
<P>
The Principles remain open to improvements and will be kept
under review, particularly in the light of changes made to the
Financial Services and Markets Bill during its current passage
through Parliament, the FSA said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Mourns Killing of 3 U.N. Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday mourned the loss of three U.N. workers, who
were killed respectively in Kosovo, the Yugoslav province, and
Burundi, saying that "All three made the ultimate sacrifice in the
cause of peace."
</P>
<P>
Annan, in a statement issued here through his spokesman, said,
"Once again today, we mourn the loss of irreplaceable colleagues."
</P>
<P>
"We mourn Valentin Krumov of Bulgaria, who was killed in Kosovo
on the day he reported for duty," Annan said, "We mourn Luis
Zuniga of Chile and another colleague who were killed in an ambush
in Burundi."
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is currently on a visit to the Balkan region, said,
"Our thoughts and prayers go to the families and friends of those
killed. They go to all the men and women of the United Nations
family who risk their lives every day to work in an environment
that poses ever greater danger."
</P>
<P>
"Let us honor the lives of these three individuals with a
prayer that their work for peace will not have in vain," he said.
"Let us remember that their work was dedicated to creating an
environment where innocent civilians will no longer be the first
victims of conflict."
</P>
<P>
"And let us insist that the killers be brought to justice," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Krumov, 38, was shot in the head on Monday evening in a
pedestrian thoroughfare where ethnic Albanians congregate at
night, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian, the first member of the U.N. mission in Kosovo
to be killed, had arrived in the Serbian province from New York
only a few hours earlier and was taking a walk with two female
colleagues when he was attacked.
</P>
<P>
"It was a disgusting and cowardly act carried out in a public
venue where hundreds of people enjoy walking in the evenings,"
chief of the U.N. Mission in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the representative of the U.N. Children's Fund
(UNICEF) in Burundi, Luis Zuniga of Chile, and another U.N. aid
worker, who is a Dutch employee of the U.N. World Food Program
(WFP) were both killed in the attack. Another U.N. officials was
wounded.
</P>
<P>
The two U.N. workers were ambushed shortly after arriving at
Muzye camp for refugees of the country's six-year civil war about
20 kilometers south of the southern town of Rutana.
</P>
<P>
Zuniga joined UNICEF in 1987 and had been in Burundi since last
year, U.N. officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni made the pledge at the closing
ceremony of the first official meeting of the joint commission in
Ugandan capital Kampala Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The president called the Lusaka cease-fire agreement a good
solution to the year-long civil war in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"The Congo war has two dimensions: regional and international.
The Lusaka agreement deals comprehensively with all the problems.
It provides a regional security settlement," said Museveni.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord addresses long-time internal problems in the
DRC, security of neighbors including Uganda, he explained.
</P>
<P>
"The war has divided Congo for more than one year and put
neighboring countries on opposing sides. Now the agreement turns
the belligerents into partners who come to share the same
objective, that is, of fighting for African freedom," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
He said many children in the DRC have missed their exams last
year and as freedom fighters, the forces there should create
conditions for the children to have their exams this year.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan president also urged the United Nations to come in
to bring peace to the vast central African country and the region
as soon as possible.
</P>

"The U.N. should not only step in Kosovo and East Timor, it
should also come in Africa," Museveni said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official's Visit Aimed at Enhancing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming visit of U.S.
secretary of commerce to Egypt is aimed at strengthening the
bilateral trade, investment and economic cooperation, an Egyptian
minister said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
William Daley's visit is "of special importance in light of the
two countries' efforts to further promote their trade and
investment relations," Minister of Home Trade and Supply Hassan
Khedr said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. investments in Egypt are growing and cover new areas,
Khedr said in remarks carried by Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Daley is to start a two-day visit to Egypt on Wednesday. He
will be leading a business development mission grouping
representatives from a wide range of sectors, including finance,
medical services, telecommunications, engineering and information
technologies, according to a press release of the U.S. embassy in
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Daley is expected to meet with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, Prime Minister Atef Ebeid, Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Agriculture Youssef Wali, Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa, Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade, and
Khedr to discuss ways of expanding the U.S.-Egyptian commercial
ties, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is one of the closest allies of the U.S. in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade between the two sides stood at 4.26 billion
U.S. dollars in 1998, with Egyptian exports being at 660 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has so far invested around 2 billion dollars in Egypt,
making it the largest investor in Egypt. Cairo hopes to increase
exports to 1 billion dollars in 2000 and that the U.S. will raise
and diversify its investments.
</P>
<P>
Daley's visit also falls within the U.S. efforts to activate
economic cooperation with other Middle East countries, the
Egyptian minister said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will be the fourth stop of Daley's Mideast tour, which
also includes Jordan, the Palestinian self-rule areas and Israel.
</P>
<P>
After wrapping up his trip in Egypt, Daley will further travel
to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Urges Opposition to "Come to Dialogue" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina Tuesday renewed her call to the opposition to shun "the
path of subversive activities and come to dialogue" for resolving
all issues, the official BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Shun the politics of planting bombs and destructive activities
and come to Parliament to resolve all national issues through
dialogue and discussion," she said at a mass public rally in
Tangail district, 80 kilometers northwest of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the threat of the opposition to change the
government in an "alternative way," Hasina said the recent bombing
incidents and other destructive designs in the country "are a
clear sign and signal of the path referred to by the BNP
(Bangladesh Nationalist Party) chairperson."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister accused the opposition of "exploding bombs
in mosques" and "planting bombs at newspaper offices," apparently
referring to the blast in a mosque in southeastern Bangladesh's
Khulan city which killed six people and injured many others and
the bomb recovered at a newspaper office in Dhaka last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, however, blamed the government of planting
mines at the newspaper office and bombs in mosques "in a bid to
divert public attention and to prepare the ground for enacting
harsh black laws to oppress the people," The Independent daily
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally here Monday afternoon, leader of the
opposition in Parliament and BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia said that
"the very nature of the explosives revealed that they could not be
handled by the common people."
</P>
<P>
The police could not identify who had planted the explosives
and bombs so far. "We got some clues for the latest bomb attacks
and investigation is going on to ascertain the findings,"
concerned officials were quoted by The Bangladesh Observer as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Greek President Arrives for Landmark Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos arrived here Tuesday afternoon for an official
visit, the first by a Greek head of state since the Islamic
revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
After greeting Stephanopoulos, Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami told reporters that dialog with Greece is of high
significance given Iran's status in the Middle East and the world
of Islam and the position of Greece in the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
He said relations between Iran and Greece are good, but they
should get better. He expressed hope that Stephanopoulos' visit
would serve to open new horizon in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials would hold talks with the Greek president
and his entourage on all political, cultural and economic issues,
the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
For his part, President Stephanopoulos said that Greece as a
member of the EU can help expand relations between the EU and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Greece was among the first countries to support Iran in
political and cultural exchanges as well as Iran's idea of dialog
among civilizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Greek head of state also noted that there are ample
potential and facilities for expansion of relations between the
two countries, and Greek officials are hopeful that they would
reach positive results in the political, economic and political
fields in their talks with Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
Stephanopoulos said that Athens closely follows up developments
in Iran and exchange of visits between Iran and Greece would lay
foundations for expansion of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
So far, trade between the two countries has been confined to
oil, he said, adding that there should have efforts to create
necessary facilities for broadening cooperation in other
fields.
</P>
<P>
Stephanopoulos came after Austrian President Thomas Klestil
paid a breakthrough visit to Iran last month. Klestil is the first
EU head of state to visit Iran since the nation's Islamic
revolution 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and the EU are warming up since moderate
Khatami came to office in 1997. Khatami paid a landmark visit to
Italy in March, which was widely seen as an important step in
opening links with the European bloc.

<HEADLINE> Officials Receive Penalty for Bridge Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 17 local officials held
responsible for the fatal collapse of a local bridge early this
year faced disciplinary action here today. All were members of the
Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist
Party and the Municipal Government made the announcement at a
meeting today.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the Rainbow Bridge in Qijiang County on January
4 claimed 40 lives, injured 14 and led to direct economic losses
of 6.21 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Investigations showed that the collapse was the result of poor
construction quality in relation to dereliction of duty, misuse of
power and corrupt behavior of some local officials.
</P>
<P>
The municipal authorities announced today that Zhang Kaike and
Lin Shiyuan, former secretary and deputy secretary of Qijiang
County's party committee, respectively, were ousted from the party.
They were removed from their positions soon after the accident.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the other 15 officials also received varying degrees
of penalties according to party disciplines and administrative
rules.
</P>
<P>
Lin Shiyuan was sentenced to death by the local court following
his first trial last April, and his case is currently on appeal.

<HEADLINE> Human Error Forces Shutdown of Nuclear Power Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A human error caused one
containment door in the reactor building of one of India's nuclear
power stations off its hinges recently, forcing authorities to
shut down the plant, an official of the Nuclear Power Corporation
(NPC) said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred on September 30 in unit two of the Narora
Atomic Power Station in Bulandshahr, some 80 kilometers southeast
of here, when the air-lock doors of the reactor building were
being tested for leak tightness.
</P>
<P>
There was no radiation leakage at the plant, NPC's chief
engineer M. Das said, adding that during the test, the five-ton
inner door came off its hinges due to "insufficient locking of the
pins" due to human error as the locking was not properly checked.
</P>
<P>
"The situation has been reviewed and corrective action to
repair the door are being implemented with positive tamper-proof
locking mechanisms," said Das.
</P>
<P>
He said the unit was shut down as a measure of "abundant
precaution" and the reactor would resume operation by the end of
October.
</P>
<P>
Officials decided to advance the shutting down of unit two of
the plant for annual inspection, which was due at the end of this
month.
</P>
<P>
The unit attained criticality on October 24, 1991 and began
commercial operation since July 1992.
</P>
<P>
Unit one of the station began commercial operation since
January 1991 and was now operating satisfactorily.
</P>
<P>
Unit one witnessed an accident in 1993 when a fire destroyed
its turbine generator, a mishap which was rated as level 3 in the
international nuclear event scale range of 1 to 7.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. (FDIC) said bank failures this year are expected
to create the biggest losses to the bank-deposit insurance fund
since the banking crisis in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, five bank failures will cost the fund an
estimated 510 million U.S. dollars to 810 million dollars, The
Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The losses are "a little higher than we've had in the past
couple of years," David Barr, spokesman for the FDIC, was quoted
as saying. Last year, three banks failed at an estimated cost of
about 179 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Regulators say the year-to-date loss figures are somewhat
distorted by the failure of one large bank, First National Bank of
Keystone, in Keystone, West Virginia. The loss estimate for the
Keystone failure ranges from 500 million dollar to 800 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
When they shuttered the Keystone bank in early September,
regulators said they found "evidence of apparent fraud that
resulted in the depletion of the bank's capital." The Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency said 515 million dollars in loans
remained on the bank's books instead of being removed after they
had been securitized and sold.
</P>
<P>
The other four failures in 1999 have been blamed on various
factors: poor lending practices, poor management and inadequate
board supervision.
</P>
<P>
The FDIC said that in 1992, following the bank and
savings-and-loan crisis that peaked in the early 1990s, the
failure of 122 institutions cost the fund 3.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The comptroller office has been prodding banks to tighten
lending standards. While the latest annual survey of underwriting
practices showed fewer loan losses, Comptroller John Hawke said he
reamined concerned about the "quantity and quality" of credit risk
among national banks.

<HEADLINE> African Nations Urged to Eradicate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 12 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Population Fund
representative Etta Tadesse said Tuesday that African countries
must be concerned with the eradication of poverty, a problem
believed to be closely related to rapid growth of population.
</P>
<P>
"As the population reaches six billion today, we expect that
governments in developing countries stop being concerned with the
numbers and start programs aimed at changing the people's life,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The increase in world population to six billion called for
aggressive programs to improve the standards of living for the
majority, the Zimbabwe News Agency quoted the U.N. official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Etta Tadesse said at least 356,000 children were expected to be
born Tuesday with at least 90 percent being born in poor families
and more than half being girls.
</P>
<P>
This fact called for countries to seriously consider gender
equality, she added.
</P>
<P>
"Decision makers must gear up for the challenge. There will be
more mouths to feed and high demand for shelter and other basic
necessities," she said.
</P>
<P>
In sub-Saharan Africa and parts of west and south Asia,
billions of people were deprived of basic needs, lacking
sanitation, adequate housing, clean water and health services,
with one-fifth of all children not attending school to grade five,
she said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. figures show that the world population has doubled in the
past 40 years, with one billion added in the past 12 years.
</P>
<P>
With about 10,000 children born every hour, the planet is now
accommodating an additional 78 million people a year. If the
trend continues there could be 10 billion people on the globe in
the next 50 years.

<HEADLINE> Ivanov: OSCE Summit May Usher in Russia-NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Tuesday that the summit of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, to be held in Istanbul in
November, may create conditions for "a gradual restoration of
relations between Russia and NATO in areas reflecting the sides'
mutual interests."
</P>
<P>
The adoption of a charter of European security and the signing
of adjusted treaties on the reduction of conventional forces in
Europe and on trust-building measures in Europe might provide a
foundation for this, Ivanov said in an interview with Nezavisimaya
Gazeta.
</P>
<P>
However, the restoration of Russia-NATO relations is "not a
fast-moving process," the Interfax news agency quoted Ivanov as
saying in the interview.
</P>
<P>
Russia froze its ties with NATO following the commencement of
air strikes against Yugoslavia on March 24 by the military bloc.
It has since resume relations with NATO only on cooperation in
peacekeeping operations in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
There are 3,600 Russian troops in Kosovo as part of a
multinational peacekeeping force of about 40,000.
</P>
<P>
On Moscow's ties with the United States, Ivanov said the two
countries "have deliberately relegated preparations for a summit"
although such a summit may be organized, if necessary, when the
sides discuss the parameters of the START-3 treaty which, in turn,
may be implemented if we ratify the START-2 treaty."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the second and third stages of the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) between Moscow and
Washington that provide for major reduction of strategic nuclear
arms on both sides.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Warn Against Continued Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
Tuesday repeated objection to the continued expansion of Jewish
settlements, saying it could prevent the beginning of the final
status negotiations and destroy the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Settlements will have a negative affect on the position of
Palestinian negotiators, it will destroy the peace process," said
Nabil Abourudeneh, advisor to Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
Chairman Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Abourudeneh made the remarks in the West Bank city of Ramallah
after a meeting between Arafat and visiting Italian President
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, during which the two leaders discussed the
latest development in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, who regards Jewish settlements as violation
of signed agreements, have been angered by the Israeli cabinet's
approval of the construction of 2,600 new housing units in four
West Bank settlements this week.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has condemned the decision on several occasions. PNA
Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo went further by calling it
"crazy decisions."
</P>
<P>
Israel denied it was expanding settlements, saying all the new
housing units are within the borders of existing settlements.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who took office in July with
a pledge to revive the stalled peace process, said that he will
neither build new Jewish settlements nor dismantle existing ones.
</P>
<P>
In a move apparently aimed to appease the Palestinians, an
Israeli ministerial committee reviewing the settlement policy of
the former right-wing government met Sunday for the first time and
identified seven settlements as illegal.
</P>
<P>
The seven outposts were among the 42 settlements established
in the three years of the former Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
The accelerated settlement activity in the last three years was
seen as an attempt by the settlers to grab as much as land before
Israel and the Palestinians entered the final status talks, in
which the thorniest issues including the fate of settlements will
be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians held a ceremony on September 13,
kicking off the long-overdue talks, but the Israeli side has yet
to name its negotiators.

<HEADLINE> New N.Irish Minister Says Trust is Key to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson Tuesday emphasized the need for building
trust to make the peace agreement work.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson, the surprise appointment in Monday's ministerial
reshuffle by Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, was speaking after
meeting rival political leaders in the Northern Ireland capital of
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
"Trust is the key," he said, adding that there is no
alternative to the Good Friday accord.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 Good Friday accord -- aiming to end 30 years of
bombings and shootings by outlawed groups on both sides of the
British province's Protestant and Catholic communities -- has
stalled over the timing and willingness of guerrillas to disarm.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson resigned as trade secretary last December after it
was disclosed he had taken a home loan of 373,000 pounds (617,000
U.S. dollars) from a ministerial colleague whose affairs his
department was investigating.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson held separate talks on Tuesday with party leaders
from the Protestant, pro-British Unionists and the Roman Catholic,
pro-Irish republicans and saw for himself the gap between them.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionists (UUP) and republican Sinn Fein both said
their talks had been constructive.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson vowed to press for a lasting settlement and said
mediation talks chaired by U.S. former Senator George Mitchell
were "absolutely vital" to that quest.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell was due to return to the province later on Tuesday
amid speculation that he would ask the parties to hold two days of
talks with him in London later this week in the hope that a
temporary change of venue might ease tensions.

MOSCOW, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Security Service
(FSB) is taking seriously threats made by Chechen terrorists to
commit acts of sabotage at Russian nuclear installations, an FSB
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The anti-terrorist department of the FSB, the main successor to
the Soviet KGB, has set up a special group in charge of guarding
such installations, the Interfax news agency reported, quoting
Alexander Zdanovich, head of the FSB public relations center.
</P>
<P>
Zdanovich said that armed units are also guarding these
installations, assuring the population that "the protection of
these installations is quite reliable."
</P>
<P>
Exercises are being carried out regularly for the detection and
reinforcement of "weak points", Zdanovich said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Says Sorry to Jordan Over Hebron Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel has openly apologized
to Jordan over the Hebron incident, in which a Jordanian
parliamentary delegation was heckled by Jewish settlers, said the
Israeli Foreign Ministry Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy sent a letter Tuesday to his
Jordanian counterpart Abdel-Ilah al-Khatib and expressed his sorry
for what happened in Hebron on Saturday, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Levy also expressed hope that the Israeli-Jordanian
relationship would not be damaged by such an incident, the
ministry added. Jordan is one of the only two Arab states that
signed a peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
This was the first Israel's official reaction to the Hebron
incident, following Jordan's strong protests and the cancellation
of a Israeli minister's visit to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Industry and Trade Minister Ran Cohen is scheduled to
visit Amman on Wednesday, but Jordanian government announced to
postpone the the trip indefinitely, citing the humiliation on the
Jordanian lawmakers inflicted by Israeli security forces and the
Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred when a 20-member Jordanian parliamentary
delegation led by Lower House Speaker Abdu Hadi Majali visited
Hebron, the last stop of its four-day visit to the Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
The delegation had planned to pray at the Ibrahim Mosque, but
turned back when Israeli security forces demanded that they pass
through metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
While leaving, the Jordanian lawmakers were heckled by about 15
Jewish settlers who shouted in Arabic "Abu Jihad is dead,"
referring to the military chief of the Palestine Liberation
Organization who was assassinated in 1988 in an operation widely
attributed to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers pushed the settlers away and Majali's
bodyguards rushed him into his black Mercedes. Several settlers
followed him, surrounding his car and banging on it with their
fists.
</P>
<P>
At that point, local Palestinian residents began scuffling with
the settlers and Israeli security forces. Three Palestinians were
detained by the Israeli security forces.
</P>
<P>
After the incident, Majali reportedly said that Jordan's trust
in the peace process has been shaken by the incident.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side gave a different explanation to the incident,
saying that the delegation did not contact the Israeli side about
the visit to the mosque.
</P>
<P>
Some 45 Jewish families are living under heavy protection of
the Israeli troops among 130,000 Palestinians in the West Bank
city of Hebron.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank remained
ready to lend South Africa money at any time, bank president James
Wolfensohn said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing in Pretoria, he said that he underlined
this stance to President Thabo Mbeki when they met earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
"I repeated that the bank is available for funding at any time
for the South African government," Wolfensohn said.
</P>
<P>
"What the government has to decide, given its many sources of
funding, whether it wants to borrow from us. If they do, we are
clearly available to work with them."
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said his talks with Mbeki also touched on Nigeria,
and he conveyed his belief that the newly-elected Nigerian
President Olusegun Obasanjo was intent on rooting out corruption.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the cutting edge of his interest is to reform
government and to deal with the question of corruption. I think
that he has both the desire and the capacity to do it."
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn also held talks with Finance Minister Trevor Manuel,
 businessmen and the management of the University of South Africa.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 12 (Xinhua) -- An air of gloom and
hopelessness haunted Tanzania as reports came from London that
tests on the brain of the founding father of the nation Julius
Nyerere to wake him up proved futile Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A government statement quoted doctors attending Nyerere at the
St. Thomas' Hospital in London, as reporting that Nyerere is still
in bad condition with vital internal organs showing no signs of
improvement.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by the press secretary to the president,
Geoffrey Nkurlu, said that the former head of state is still oia in 1998 but was
 not
hospitalized until last month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prayers for the recovery of Nyerere continued all
over the country in churches, mosques and other public gatherings.
National TV showed tears rolling down a woman's face while she was
joining others in praying.
</P>
<P>
Former Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda has sent a get-well
message to Nyerere. "How I wish to be at your bedside as you
struggle with a severe illness," he said.
</P>
<P>
"You have fought many battles on behalf of Africa and the
progressive world. We beg you to emerge from this battle
victorious. We know that our destiny is the prerogative of the
almighty God and we pray he will look kindly at Africa because
Africa needs you desperately," said Kaunda, who is also President
of the opposition UNIP party in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere led the then Tanganyika to independence from Britain in
1961 and masterminded its union with Zanzibar to form Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
After retiring president in 1985, he played an advisory role in
both Tanzanian politics and African affairs. Since 1996, he has
been tirelessly brokering peace in neighboring Burundi.

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Smuggling Spreading in Western Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Cigarette smuggling is
spreading on a large scale in western Romania, reaching alarming
quotas in the past months, reported the local Nine O'clock daily
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to calculations made by domestic manufacturers of
cigarettes, at least 700 boxes of Winchester cigarettes were sold
last month alone in each of the counties of Mehedinti,
Caras-Severin and Timis.
</P>
<P>
Considering that smugglers sell each package by one third less
than the official price, they gained 2.1 billion lei (126,500 U.S.
dollars), while the state lost 3.7 billion lei (222,890 U.S.
dollars) in uncollected taxes.
</P>
<P>
Dorina Meca, the chief of the Portile de Fier 1 customs, said
the main source of supply is the duty-free shops. Unstamped
Winchester and Monte Carlo cigarettes arrive in Romania by truck
via Yugoslavia or from other free zones. They are then sold in
hard currency to duty-free shops at prices of approximately 60
percent of that of foreign cigarettes made in Romania.
</P>
<P>
Another way to introduce cigarettes in Romania is through
persons who cross the border into Romania daily. Sanctions for
"eluding the paying of customs duties" are too small to act as a
deterrent against smuggling.
</P>
<P>
This is why in the western Romania the official sales of
cigarettes dropped between 30 percent and 70 percent, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Lauds Military Cooperation Among Egypt, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A visiting British official on
Tuesday lauded the military cooperation among Egypt, European
countries, including Britain, and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Britain's participation in an ongoing joint military exercise
in Egypt will boost military cooperation between Egypt and other
countries, and test the combating capabilities of its forces,
British Minister of State for Defense Peter Kilsoyle said at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen British warships and 5,000 naval troops will take
part in the 20-day multinational war game, code-named "Bright
Star '99", Kilsoyle said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the United Arab Emirates kicked off the first stage
of the maneuver on Sunday. Britain, France, Germany, Greece,
Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, the Netherlands and the United States will
also join the war game aimed at enhancing what the countries have
declared cooperation in securing peace and stability in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the U.S. first launched the exercise in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Kilsoyle arrived in Cairo on Tuesday for a four-day visit,
during which he will inspect the British troops participating in
the military exercise. Egyptian Minister of Defense and Military
Production Hussein Tantawi met with him after his arrival.
</P>
<P>
The British official told the news conference that he came here
in a bid to seek ways of promoting bilateral cooperation in the
military domain.
</P>
<P>
He said he is satisfied with the outcome of his talks with
Tantawi on the issues of mutual interest. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Referring to land mines planted in Egypt during the World War
II, Kilsoyle said Britain has contributed more than 1 million
U.S. dollars and provided maps of mine fields to help Egypt remove
them.
</P>
<P>
Millions of land mines planted during the World War II remain
buried in the Alamein area in northwestern Egypt, posing threat to
people's life and hindering development projects in the area.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has called on the then belligerent countries, mainly
Britain and Germany, of the battles in northern Egypt to offer
funds and equipment for the removal of the land mines.

<HEADLINE> Prada-LVMH Buy Controlling Stake in Fendi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The famous Italian fashion company
Prada and the French luxury group LVMH announced here Tuesday that
they bought a controlling stake in Fendi, the Rome-based fashion
house.
</P>
<P>
A joint venture, in which Prada and LVMH have equal shares,
will control a stake of at least 51 percent of the fashion company
built up around the five Fendi sisters, a statement released by
Fendi said.
</P>
<P>
The Fendi family will keep up to 49 percent of the company's
share capital and also continue to occupy the positions of
chairman and general manager and to oversee the house's general
style and strategy, it said.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the operation was not revealed but Woman's Wear
Daily, a U.S. publication, reported Monday that Prada and LVMH had
made a firm offer of 850 million U.S. dollars and that it had been
accepted.
</P>
<P>
Fendi said that the house's chief designer, Karl Lagerfeld,
would continue with the firm where he has worked for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The financial contribution of Prada and LVMH will make "a new
phase of development" possible for the Fendi label, without
sacrificing the family tradition and individual style of the
company, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The deal to buy control of Fendi gives LVMH chairman Bernard
Arnault a long sought foothold in Italian fashion, albeit within
the limits of a joint venture with Prada.
</P>
<P>
In January this year LVMH, which has luxury brands such as
Louis Vuitton, began a long, and ultimately fruitless, bid to gain
control of Gucci, another big name in Italian fashion.

<P>
LONDON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Europe's main stock markets all
ended sharply lower Tuesday as an early slide on Wall Street
weakened sentiment already dampened by a mixed set of inflation
figures.
</P>
<P>
The UK's leading shares closed down almost 60 points at
6174.79, about 1 percent as profit-taking and weaker U.S. shares
hit banking stocks.
</P>
<P>
Investors sold Abbey National, Barclays and HSBC shares. Royal
&AMP; Sun Alliance shares were also unwanted, a day after news that
earthquakes and wild weather cost the firm a lot over the last
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The market received little boost from a set of inflation
figures which showed price rises were steady at a five-year low.
</P>
<P>
Electronics retailer Dixons led the FTSE gainers with a 4.2
percent advance as UK retail sales data for September revealed
strong demand for its core product lines.
</P>
<P>
Two of the biggest sectors in London also offered some upside.
Oil shares recovered from selling in previous sessions, while
telecom issues remained in favor.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax in Frankfurt was off 1.03 percent at 5358.48 on
the session after last week's steep gains as fall of profit-taking
by business software firm SAP AG all but overshadowed telecoms
shares.

Paris' CAC 40 was the weakest of the major markets in Europe on
the day as it slid 63.8 points or 1.35 percent to end at 4658.54.

ADDIS ABABA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said here Tuesday
that countries of the world should review urgently their policies
regarding the production, availability and transfer of arms and
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Dominique Buff, head of the ICRC mission to the Addis
Ababa-based Organization of African Unity (OAU), said countries
need to assess their approach towards landmines and light weapons
in light of their responsibility to respect for International
Humanitarian Law.
</P>
<P>
Dominique made the appeal at the round table conference among
ambassadors accredited to the OAU in connection with the
commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Geneva convention.
</P>
<P>
He said that highly lethal weapons are increasingly falling
into the hands of all types of fighters, which frequently are
targeted at civilians.
</P>
<P>
Beside, the unlimited spread and utilization of anti-personnel
landmines and light weapons have also become one of the urgent
issues to be addressed in today's world, the ICRC official said.

UNITED NATIONS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Although the United
Nations has made "notable progress" in promoting women to senior
levels, it will not reach its self-imposed target of overall
gender parity in its workforce by 2000, a U.N. report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan cited low staff
turnover, recruitment freeze and downsizing as factors that have
hamstrung the U.N.'s ability to achieve balanced gender
distribution.
</P>
<P>
Outlining a strategy to achieve gender parity, the report
included specific targets and monitoring procedures to improve
gender balance in individual departments and offices.
</P>
<P>
Attention will also be given to policies and practices to
accommodate work and family responsibilities so as to attract and
retain the best staff, Annan said in the report.
</P>

The report has been taken up by the General Assembly's Third
Committee which deals with social and humanitarian issues.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Proud of Scientist's Winning Nobel Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Tuesday voiced its pride
for Ahmad Zoweil, who is the first Egyptian scientist to win the
Nobel Prize for chemistry.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Prime Minister Atef Ebeid
sent separate cables of congratulation to Zoweil after he was
laureated in the day by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for
his "pioneering role in a revolution in chemistry by demonstrating
that a rapid laser technique can observe the motion of atoms in a
molecule as they occur during a chemical reaction."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said in the telegram that he was proud that "one of
Egypt's exemplary sons has been honored by the international
community," wishing Zoweil further success, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"It is an honor," the agency quoted Minister of Information
Safwat el-Sherif as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Every Egyptian takes pride that one of the sons of Egypt has
risen to this world standard as a prominent scientist in a most
specialized science," he said.
</P>
<P>
"By winning the Nobel Prize, Zoweil has set an example for
youth that the way of science is the way which brings benefits to
humanity and glory to its maker," el-Sherif added.
</P>
<P>
Zoweil, who holds both Egyptian and U.S. citizenship, has held
the Linus Pauling chair of chemical physics at the California
Institute of Technology since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences honored him for his
pioneering investigation of fundamental chemical reactions, using
ultra-short laser flashes, on the time scale in which the
reactions actually occur.
</P>
<P>
The academy said Zoweil's work in the late 1980s led to the
birth of femtochemistry, the use of high-speed cameras to monitor
chemical reactions at a scale of femtoseconds, or
0.000000000000001 second.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Science Association of Egypt Ali Hebash
underlined that Zoweil's winning of the international trophy "has
secured him a worldwide fame far beyond the borders of both Egypt
and the U.S.."
</P>
<P>
Zoweil "deserves the prize in view of his scientific
contributions and tireless and valuable efforts in the scientific
research," President of Ain Shams University Hassan Gallab said.
</P>
<P>
Before Zoweil, late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat won the
Nobel Prize for peace after making peace with Israel in 1979 and
Naguib Mahfouz, a renowned writer, won the laurel for literature
in early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Final Accord Signed to Benefit Over 500 Million Africans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The signature of a final
agreement to implement two Centers of Excellence in Africa within
the framework of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
Center of Excellence Program has been announced.
</P>
<P>
The joint initiative, announced by the ITU, Nortel Networks and
the Acacia Initiative of the International Development Research
Center of Canada, will benefit more than 500 million Africans
living in rural or remote areas, said the ITU in a press release
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Aiming to provide solutions to the challenges of universal
access and rural connectivity in Africa, the centers, located
respectively in Nairobi of Kenya and Dakar of Senegal, will serve
all countries of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the final arrangements, the three parties have
agreed to an overall investment of 3.6 million U.S. dollars
enabling the two African Centers of Excellence to start immediate
operations.
</P>
<P>
As a principal private sector partner in this project, Nortel
Networks will contribute to more than 1 million dollars over the
next three years including training materials and support,
enabling the programs to be launched shortly.
</P>
<P>
The ITU African Centers of Excellence initiative is an
innovative approach to train policy makers and regulators in the
development of national sector priorities and regulations
conducive to private sector investment, as well as senior
corporate managers in the management of telecommunications
networks and services.
</P>
<P>
"Africa represents a large market which is still too often
hampered by the world's highest costs, critical skills shortages
and stymied policies that, together, foil teledensity goals and
adequate infrastructure, said Hamadoun I. Toure, director of the
ITU's Telecommunication Development Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"This new form of cooperation is one of the promising ways to
boost telecommunication development where traditional mechanisms
did not yield results and should send strong signals to the
industry on the way forward," he added.

<HEADLINE> Increased Outflow of Singaporeans Concerned: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong has expressed his serious concern over increased outflow
of Singaporeans and urged to win the hearts of Singaporeans
against attractions elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Goh voiced his concern when he joined in the debate in
Parliament on the President's Address made on October 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Citing data provided by the Ministry of Manpower, Goh said
there are 150,000 Singaporeans estimated to be overseas on
long-term basis, including working adults and their dependents,
emigrants and students.
</P>
<P>
Based on the number given by the Police, he said each year some
2,000 Singaporeans pack up their bags and emigrate, adding that
more than half of the emigrants are females, many of whom married
foreigners and leave Singapore to join their husbands.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the prime minister said there are also some 6,000
applications to the Ministry of Defense each year for reservist
training deferment on ground of overseas employment of duration
longer than six months.
</P>
<P>
Conceding that more Singaporeans will take wing in the
circumstance of increasing globalisation and their mobility, Goh
stressed that "as Singaporeans become even more cosmopolitan, the
issue of concern to us is whether they will become less rooted to
Singapore."
</P>
<P>
"We have to even compete for the hearts of Singaporeans against
attractions elsewhere," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also called for "developing each and every
Singaporean", saying "there are not many of us to build and
protect our home, so we have to provide every Singaporean with
opportunity to develop his or her potential to the fullest."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Goh suggested the government take moves to
introduce compulsory education, to turn Singapore into a nation of
ideas through consultations and participation and to give
Singaporeans an emotional stake as well as a physical stake.

<HEADLINE> WHO Calls for One Bednet for Every African Child in Malaria Rollback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Up to 700,000 African children
died last year from malaria, but a four-dollar bednet could have
saved them, the World Health Organization (WHO) said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Today, we challenge the world to provide every child in Africa
with an insecticide-treated bednet," said Dr. David Nabarro,
project manager for Roll Back Malaria in WHO.
</P>
<P>
As the first step, 60 million African families will be provided
with insecticide-treated mosquito nets over the next five years,
according to WHO, which estimates that only two million African
households have and use bednets now.
</P>
<P>
WHO said that the low availability is alarming, adding that "
evidence shows treated nets can cut malaria deaths by nearly 25
percent." The new approach will also help the world reduce its
reliance on DDT.
</P>
<P>
Malaria is transmitted through the bite of an infected
anopheline mosquito, which is most active between dusk and dawn.
According to WHO, the disease kills 1.1 million people worldwide
each year. Approximately 1 million of these deaths are in Africa,
an estimated 700,000 of them children. These malaria deaths
account for one out of every four childhood deaths in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Roll Back Malaria is a global movement that includes political
leaders and citizens from malaria-ridden countries, WHO, the
United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Development
Program, the World Bank, and development agencies, scientific
institutions, private sector bodies and governments worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Capable of Heading UN Peacekeeping Force in E. Timor: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has the
capability to head the U.N. peacekeeping force to be set up among
ASEAN members to restore the situation in East Timor if given the
responsibility to do so, Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia had the experience as its troops had participated in
various U.N. peacekeeping missions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia has got the capability, and we have got the
personnel... to lead any mission that we are given charge of, and
we want to know what is the decision of the United Nations,"
Bernama news agency quoted him as saying while asked to comment on
the proposal for the setting up of a U.N. peacekeeping force to be
participated by ASEAN countries to restore the situation in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, said Malaysia will not ask the United
Nations to give it the task of heading the U.N. peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
"We will play a suitable role according to the decision of
parties responsible in making decisions so that we can together
take part in whatever peacekeeping force set up. For now, I was
informed by New York it is still at the discussion stage. As such,
we'll wait until it is decided that it is the ASEAN nations that
will be taking part in," he said.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid dismissed the possibility that Indonesia would be
asked to join the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has now 30 officers and men in the International Force
in East Timor led by Australia.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Ban Sale of Cannabis Seeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Health Ministry is
trying to introduce legislation to ban the sale and possession of
cannabis seeds.
</P>
<P>
The possession and sale of any other part of the cannabis
plant or its derivatives is illegal in Cyprus, but there is
nothing to stop anyone buying cannabis seeds, commonly sold in
bird-seed mix, and even sowing them.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Health Ministry now wants to close this loophole by
banning the sale of cannabis seeds, the Cyprus Mail newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A relevant bill has just been tabled before the Parliament to
bring Cyprus in line with European Union law, the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ban would not only limit the variety of the diet of local
parrots but will also effect local cuisine. Cannabis seeds have
been an ingredient in Cyprus' many traditional breads and
pastries.

<HEADLINE> Ousted PM Had Planned to Arrest Army Chief: Army Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The ousted Pakistani prime
minister, Nawaz Sharif, had planned to arrest Army Chief General
Pervaiz Musharraf, who later announced the dismissal of the
government after a coup, said a military spokesman Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government wanted to arrest General Musharraf after
diverting the flight from Colombo, which the general was on board
and was due to land at the Karachi international airport, to
Nawabshah, a city 200 kilometers northeast of Karachi, the
spokesman was quoted by the News Network International as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The army chief would have been arrested and taken to unknown
destination," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, armed policemen were present at the
airport when the PIA (Pakistan International Airlines) plane
reached Karachi. When the Control Tower reported that it is short
of fuel, the Civil Aviation Authority personnel directed the pilot
to take it to any neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
The pilot replied that the only neighboring country is India
and he "was told to take the plane to India".
</P>
<P>
However, this message was interrupted by Lt. General Muzaffar
H. Usmani who acted immediately and took control of the airport,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The anonymous spokesman said Sharif sent the army chief to Sri
Lanka and the conspiracy was hatched in his absence. But the army
senior leadership moved in and "saved the country from a
disaster".
</P>
<P>
In an abrupt move late Tuesday, the army house arrested Sharif
and his close allies and took control of the country's power after
Sharif announced to fire General Musharraf earlier Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> No Secret for Miller's Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Liu Guang
</P>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Shannon Miller is outstanding
in gymnastics but her way to success is not unique.
</P>
<P>
Peggy Liddick, head coach of the Australian women's team for
the 34th world championships, was the personal coach of Miller and
she had the say in what has been necessary to produce such great
as Miller, a legend who has 17 world gymnastics medals to her
credit.
</P>
<P>
Miller, who retired after the Atlanta Olympic Games, was
invited here by the Tianjin organizers as a former athlete
representative.
</P>
<P>
"Shannon was talented, self-motivated, hardworking and
disciplined," said Liddick. "We also have addition to the training
like medical support and sports psychology."
</P>
<P>
"She worked 40 hours a week and two or three training sessions
a day. People who work hard excel, it is no secret," added the
coach.
</P>
<P>
"You will always exclaim 'My God' to the difficult elements
Miller performed, but to us, it was a step-by-step process through
years of efforts."
</P>
<P>
Miller began receiving coaching from Liddick at the age of 7
and it took them eight years to claim a world title.
</P>
<P>
What also impressed Liddick was the discipline of Miller who
has never missed a day of training in 10 years under the guidance
of Liddick.
</P>
<P>
"Even when she broke her arm, she did not miss the training,
for she thought she still could use her leg to exercise. she
wanted it badly, she loved the sports, loved to compete and loved
to win."
</P>
<P>
Miller worked so hard that Liddick sometimes had to intervene
to slow down her student, said Liddick.
</P>
<P>
"She was so hard working that I had to stop her. If I said she
needed 10 routines she would do more."
</P>
<P>
But the coach held it was common practice among gymnastic
greats like Svetlana Khorkina and Li Ning.
</P>
<P>
"It is not unique, it is the same story to successful gymnasts
whether Khorkina or Li Ning." Liddick stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the part of Liddick she also was a great factor for Miller's
success.
</P>
<P>
"I had to be strict with her, for it was my job to guide her.
But first I needed to be strict with myself. I needed to give 100
percent if I wanted her to give 100. If I were lazy, how could I
expect my gymnasts to give their 100," Liddick said.
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of Liddick it is important to give "direct energy"
to her gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
"Gymnasts always take the message from the coach. If I am sad
before gymnasts that would influence the gymnasts. I have to be
professional, and have to separate private life from professional
life," said Liddick.
</P>
<P>
Though beginning to coach in Australia in 1997, Liddick has
kept updated with what went on in American gymnastics, thinking
there will be more "Magnificent Seven" emerging as a result of the
great depth that the United States possess.
</P>
<P>
Since Romanian legend Bela Karolyi came to the United States in
the early 1980s, he has brought fresh system to the American
coaches and pushed the American gymnastics to a new high.
</P>
<P>
"He gets all American coaches motivated. He also introduced
talent identification system at an early age and physical training
before you do gymnastics. This is different concept to our coaches,
" Liddick said.
</P>
<P>
Bela was the coach of Romanian Nadia Comaneci who was the first
girl to score perfect 10 in Olympic competition and he was the
coach legend who started Romanian Dynasty by breaking the
dominance of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
"So the Magnificent Seven success was not luck but a result of
the system he brought in," Liddick said of the Magnificent Seven
who grabbed the 1996 Olympic team gold.
</P>
<P>
"After the Magnificent Seven turned professional, the newcomers
are not just ready. They don't have difficulty (in their routines)
yet they are working on it. But I think they will be much stronger
for the Sydney Olympics," she said.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Marked Progress in Natural Disaster Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China has basically established
a comprehensive system for natural disaster reduction which has
played an important role in the nation's economic and social
development for the past ten years, a senior official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Ismail Amat, State Councilor and Chairman of the China
Committee of the International Decade for Natural Disaster
Reduction, made the remarks at a meeting marking the 10th
International Day for Natural Disaster Reduction here today.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that natural disasters lead to direct
economic losses equivalent to between three and six percent of
China's Gross National Product each year.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, disaster reduction has been viewed seriously
by the central authorities, and the state has worked out a long-
term program and relative laws and regulations in this regard,
Amat said.
</P>
<P>
Saying that disaster reduction is one of the major components
in China's policy of sustained development, he described it as
long-term, arduous work.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary that all of society better understand and take
part in the task, and that the nation organize a number of key
projects for disaster reduction, he said.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislator Inspects Three Gorges Construction Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Three Gorges project is
striking proof that socialism can focus all of its resources on
grand accomplishments, chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC) Li Peng said during a recent
inspection tour of a key construction site of the water
conservancy project.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, said that
the smooth progress of the big dam project relies on the strong
support of the people around the country.
</P>
<P>
The project on the Yangtze river is now in the second phase of
construction, and the relocation of residents in the to-be-
submerged areas is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with engineers on October 12 in Yichang, Hubei
Province, Li urged them to guarantee quality of the construction.
He said that funds for the construction of the Three Gorges
project are in place, providing favorable conditions for good work.
And he said that in order to maintain a high standard of
engineering, it is necessary to fully utilize advanced
technologies, equipment and scientific management.
</P>
<P>
Noting that 450,000 people must be relocated before the
completion of the second phase of construction in 2003, he urged
the local governments in Chongqing city and Hubei province to
establish a system of responsibility for individual officials so
that the relocation work stays on schedule.
</P>
<P>
He said experience shows that the guideline of linking people's
relocation with local development is absolutely correct. He called
on localities to continue to implement the guideline in work and
creatively explore new ways of completing the relocation job.
</P>
<P>
He said that the local governments should do a good job with
the employment of the relocated people through every means
possible.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the relocated people to work hard to build a
new home with the aid from the State.

primary and secondary school students, said a senior official with
the Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
He said that 80 percent of China's 600,000 drug addicts are

contests and symposiums. In some localities, students were
organized to visit drug rehabilitation centers or anti-drug
education centers.

<HEADLINE> Regulation on Assessment of Stock-Listing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China has adopted a regulation
guiding the operation of stock-listing assessors with China
Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), who have the final say on
whether an enterprise can be listed on stock market or not.
</P>
<P>
CSRC is the watchdog of China stock market, and the Stock-
Listing Assessors Committee functions as the only arbitrator from
which Chinese enterprises have to get final approval before they
enter the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has approved the "CSRC Stock-Listing
Assessors Committee Regulation", drafted in accordance with China'
s Securities Law.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, the assessors are required to be
qualified and have good knowledge about China's macro-economic
policies, laws concerning securities market, stock-trading
business, and have good professional judgment.
</P>
<P>
The number of non-CSRC officials holding seats in the committee
is fixed at 78 percent of the total, in order to ensure the
transparency of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Except for some permanent committee members, no one can serve
on the committee for more than three consecutive terms. Each term
lasts two years.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, at least one third of these committee members will be
changed after having served two years.
</P>
<P>
Committee decisions are to be made through secret ballot, and
all decisions require a consensus of at least two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
Market observers said that the regulation will help maintain
the stable and healthy development of China's stock market.

<HEADLINE> Rare Granite Stone Forest in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A rare granite stone forest was
recently discovered on the Greater Khingan Mountain Range in
northeast China, sources from the Chinese Academy of Geological
Sciences said here today.
</P>
<P>
The granite stone forest, a rare landform in the world, covers
an area of five square kilometers on the mountain, which is about
1,700 meters high, said Qian Fang, who discovered the spot.
</P>
<P>
The tallest stone towers exceed 20 meters, with most of them
connected at their base. The forest, stretching several hundred
meters on the mountain, is indeed a scenic spot, said Qian, a
researcher with the academy.
</P>
<P>
Most of the stone forests discovered so far are limestone,
including the famous Guilin Stone Forest in southwest China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Geologists say the newly-found granite site was formed from the
combined effect of the rising lithosphere, ancient glacier, wind
and water erosion.
</P>
<P>
Qian went to the mountain area aiming to study the glacier
there and heard about a strange stone forest from local farmers,
but few could identify its remote location.
</P>
<P>
Geologists say the granite stone forest will aid the study of
ancient environments and climate changes.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Greece to Coordinate Stances on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides left Wednesday for Athens for consultations in
the light of warming ties between Greece and Turkey, the two key
players in the Cyprus peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Cyprus' Larnaca airport, Kasoulides said the
improvement of the climate between Greece and Turkey should
benefit efforts to settle the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
He said he will exchange views with his Greek counterpart
on tactics to be followed, within the framework of existing
close cooperation and mutual understanding between the two
governments.
</P>
<P>
He refrained, however, from commenting on concern expressed by
political leaders in Cyprus regarding Greece's stance on the
possible upgrading of relations between Turkey and the European
Union during EU's Helsinki summit in December.
</P>
<P>
During its Luxembourg summit two years ago, the EU called on
Turkey to address several issues, including the improvement of its
relations with Greece in order to facilitate efforts to settle the
Cyprus issue, before it could join in the bloc.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's accession bid is expected to be discussed at the
Helsinki summit.
</P>
<P>
Greece has been seeking ways to lift its longstanding
objections to Turkish candidacy amid a warming of bilateral
relations and mounting calls from its EU partners to help
bring Turkey closer to the Western bloc.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry source in Athens said Tuesday that Greece
will discuss with its EU partners this month the issue of lifting
its objections to Turkey's EU candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with
Athens.

<HEADLINE> China to Drill 5,000-Meter Well for Science Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China has started drilling a 5,
000-meter well in Donghai County in east China's Jiangsu Province
to mine geological information from deep inside the earth that
might give answers to problems involving resources, disasters, and
the environment.
</P>
<P>
China's continental scientific drilling project, one of the
nation's key science projects between 1996 and 2000, has been
approved by the State Development Planning Commission, according
to sources from the Ministry of Land and Resources.
</P>
<P>
Geologists have said the well is like a telescope that looks
deep inside of the earth, and that it will greatly help the
research of earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Compared with continental drilling projects in other countries,
this well will offer more information about the earth, said Yang
Wencai, one of the principal investigators of the project.
</P>
<P>
As the drilling project is of great importance to global
geological research, scientists from the United States, France,
Canada and Germany took part in the study.
</P>
<P>
According Yang, this is China's first continental deep drilling,
and was approved by the International Continental Drilling Program.
The global organization also provided 1.5 million US dollars for
the project.
</P>
<P>
Scientists will obtain bore core, liquid and gas samples, and
abstract various data from the samples to study the formation of
the lithosphere and explore mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the well will be drilled at a hard
crystallization area and requires high technology. Various sites
for drilling, survey and remote sensing and long-term monitoring
labs will be established.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than ten countries have drilled over 100
continental deep wells, but only 10 of them are deeper than 5,000
meters.

<HEADLINE> Departments Urged to Step Up Fight Against Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official today
asked both discipline and law enforcement departments across the
country to do more in the fight against high-level corruption and
increase efficiency in handling cases.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for party committees, governments and law
enforcement departments at various levels to more quickly wrap up
a number of major cases so as to effectively rein in corrupt
practices, Wei Jianxing, member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central
Committee, said at a three-day national conference on the topic
here.
</P>
<P>
Wei, also secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection, called for continued efforts in building a clean party
which is the political guarantee for the party's development in
the next century.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core has
strengthened the fight against corruption and made remarkable
progress in handling such cases, but the work has a long way to go,
Wei said.
</P>
<P>
He asked discipline and law enforcement departments to crack
down on corrupt officials, saying the battle will be a "long-term
and complicated struggle."
</P>
<P>
The anti-corruption move is of importance to ensuring economic
development, deepening reform and maintaining social stability,
Wei said.
</P>
<P>
The related departments should be fully aware of their
responsibilities both to the party and the people, and carry out
their duties to the latter to safeguard the party discipline and
law of the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
He asked the departments to concentrate on handling major cases
concerning party organizations, governmental bodies and officials
at the county level and above.
</P>
<P>
Increased efforts should be made in handling cases in the
fields of finance, stock, real estate and construction, while
attention should be paid to cases related to loss of state assets
in the reform of state-owned enterprises, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of nurturing and building a
qualified discipline and law enforcement task force, and
encouraged related departments to find effective ways to tackle
new problems emerging from the social changes under new
circumstances.

Wednesday after he was sworn in as India's new prime minister that
his government would give special attention to universal primary
education and infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from his first meeting of the Council of Ministers,
Vajpayee told the press that the implementation of welfare schemes
is more important than the allocation of funds.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over the tardy implementation of various
programs, he said funds allocated were not duly spent on their
execution.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee, 72, took over again as prime minister of India for a
third term, and, this time, is leading a National Democratic
Alliance (NDA) government of the Bharatiya Jananta Party (BJP).
</P>
<P>
The NDA consists of 24 small parties holding a total of 304
seats in Lok Sabha, the Lower House of Parliament, with BJP
holding a majority totaling 182.
</P>
<P>
However, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), the second largest party
after the BJP in the NDA, which holds 29 seats in Lok Sabha, has
refused to join the new government, but promised to give support
to it from outside.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said that before he decided on the formation of the
government, he had a long talk with TDP party chief N. Chandrababu
Naidu during which he put forth his view.
</P>
<P>
He said his NDA government would be quite stable this time,
adding that "our association with TDP is strong" and that the
party had extended full support to his previous government which
lasted for only 13 months from March 1998.
</P>
<P>
Senior minister and one of the top BJP leaders L. K. Advani
said that there were "no pulls and pressures" in the formation of
the new government.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of India signing the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT) if Washington delays its ratification, he said, "we
have informed the whole world and are trying to build a consensus
on the signing of the treaty."
</P>
<P>
There have been some new developments in Washington, said
Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
He expressed grave concern over the latest developments in
neighboring Pakistan, saying his country had taken all precautions
against any possible fall-out.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee asserted that it was for Islamabad to create a climate
for the resumption of the stalled dialogue for the normalization
of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We wish the people of Pakistan well. We remain committed to
developing friendly relations and cooperative ties with Pakistan
based on mutual trust and confidence for which the government of
Pakistan needs to create the right environment," Vajpayee said.
</P>
<P>
During the over-two-hour ceremony presided over by President
Kocheril Raman Narayanan, 70 members of the Council of Ministers
including Vajpayee took their oaths respectively.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee announced that portfolios of the new ministers would
be distributed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 70 members of the Council of Ministers, 25 are cabinet
ministers, seven ministers of state with independent charge and 37
ministers of state on other duties.

<HEADLINE> Positive Sentiment Picking up in Retail Sector: FS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang said Wednesday that positive sentiment was
starting to filter through the retail sector, with retail sale in
July recording positive year-on-year growth for the first time
since September 1997.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the luncheon meeting of the Retail Management
Association, Tsang said that the retail industry had been waging
its toughest battle in the past two years in the aftermath of the
Asian financial turmoil. Retailers had done all they could to
weather the downturn.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's legendary competitive environment continues to
hone the best and fittest in the retail industry. And that is why
our retail industry will eventually emerge from this recession a
lot more street-wise, a lot leaner," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang noted that improved sentiment would hopefully translate
into positive territory for both sales volume and value in the
last quarter of this year, especially during the busy Christmas
and Chinese New Year periods.
</P>
<P>
The retailing industry should have benefited from many of the
economic relief and revenue concessions during the past two years,
Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
These included the freeze - in some cases reduction - in most
government fees and charges; and 10 percent tax rebate and rates
rebate.
</P>
<P>
He said these economic stimulus measures would have freed up
well over 40 billion HK dollars (5.13 billion U.S. dollars) in the
current and previous fiscal years by the time they fully trickled
through and go back to the accounts of small businesses, their
staff and all other taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
To help more Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), many of whom
are retailers, Tsang said the amount of guarantee for loans
provided under the 2.5 billion HK dollars (320 million U.S.
dollars) special finance scheme would be doubled as announced by
the chief executive in his Policy Address last week.
</P>
<P>
The scheme was set up in August 1998 to offer guarantees of up
to 70 percent to small businesses which needed to raise bank
financing.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tsang said that the newly established SME Information
Center within the Industry Department provided a one-stop shop for
information on services and support offered by the government to
SMEs.
</P>
<P>
The Business and Services Promotion Unit under his office is
also studying how the process of retrieving building plans by
retail business can be revamped, the financial secretary said.
</P>
<P>
The target is to make building plans available more easily and
quickly using advanced information technology.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, a new initiative coming on-line, which will help
develop e-commerce in Hong Kong, is the Electronic Services
Delivery Scheme.
</P>
<P>
"This will give members of the public and businesses on-line
access to certain types of services, and allow the payment of
various government fees and bills," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Electronic Transactions Bill has been introduced into the
legislature to establish a legal framework for electronic commerce
in Hong Kong and give electronic transactions the same legal
status as paper-based transactions.
</P>
<P>
"The Bill will be of particular relevance to the retail sector
as more and more people take to the net to do business. All of
these steps will help pump-prime the development of e-commerce in
Hong Kong," he said.

said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that today's teenagers will be tomorrow's pillars of
society, and that the hope of the country and the nation rests

Young Pioneers (CYP) in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the CYP organization and counselors and
workers of the CYP to better understand the teenagers, and to
place priority on the development of their creativity and their
practical ability to improve themselves all-round so that they
will be ready for future challenges.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CYP has trod a glorious path over the past 50
years. Under the leadership of the CPC and the guidance of the
Communist Youth League (CYL), the CYP has played an irreplaceable
role in promoting the growth of teenagers.
</P>
<P>
He said that the teenagers, the people and history will never
forget the advanced thoughts and stories of model teenagers and
CYP counselors and workers of various periods.

Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, and with the
concerted efforts of the people of all ethnic groups in the
country, the motherland will have a glorious future, as will the
cause of the red-scarfed CYP.

<P>
More than 10,000 young pioneers attended a flag-raising
ceremony this morning at Tian'anmen Square in Beijing to mark the
50th anniversary of the CYP.

<HEADLINE> 1,679 HIV Carriers Identified in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of HIV carriers in
Iran reached 1,679 at present, 226 cases, or 16 percent, more than
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
This was announced Wednesday by Dr. Reza Labaf Qasemi, director
general in charge of campaign against diseases at the Iranian
Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a domestic seminar on prevention of diseases and
health care at schools, Qasemi said that 250 people of the total
have been diagnosed as having full-blown AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
The human immunedeficiency virus, known as HIV, could cause
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, known as AIDS.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency, Qasemi
said that half of the HIV carriers in Iran are addicts of narcotic
drugs, who are especially vulnerable to HIV transmission.
</P>
<P>
Iran's first AIDS case was recorded in 1985 when a one-year-old
baby was found to have contracted the disease from a transfusion
of imported blood.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that there have been 1,443 HIV positive
cases identified in Iran up to October, 1998 and 206 cases of the
total have progressed to full-blown AIDS, of which 176 people have
already died.
</P>
<P>
Qasemi also said that some 19,000 health care centers are
involved in fighting against various diseases in villages
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that some 1.2 billion rials (about 400,000
U.S. dollars) is annually spent on campaigns against epidemic
diseases, training, and prevention of diseases in the country.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that various diseases including measles,
pertussis, tetanus, infantile paralysis and diphtheria are
currently under control in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Only 12.5 people in every 100,000 are currently afflicted with
tuberculosis in the country while the ratio was 80 in every
100,000 some 20 years ago, he added.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Withdraw Troops From Turkmenistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian defense
official said Wednesday that Russian troops stationed in
Turkmenistan since 1994 will be withdrawn from the Central Asian
republic.
</P>
<P>
"The group's mission was justified at one time, but now the
Turkmen armed forces have become self-sufficient, and its mission
has practically exhausted itself," said Russian First Deputy
Defense Minister Vasily Mikhailov after his meeting with Turkmen
President Saparmurad Niyazov in Ashgabat.
</P>
<P>
"This is our mutual position," Mikhailov said, noting that the
two sides intended to agree on the procedure of withdrawal, after
which the group of 50 Russian officers will leave Turkmenistan,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mikhailov is in Turkmenistan in what is believed to be the
first visit paid by a high-ranking Russian military official in
five years. He said Russian-Turkmen military cooperation will now
be coordinated by a new agency, a bilateral committee for military-
technical cooperation. This issue will be finalized during Turkmen
Defense Minister Batyr Sardzhayev's visit to Russia in the first
quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
He said his talks with Niyazov were conducted in the spirit of
"mutual understanding," and they had a useful exchange of views on
national security and geopolitical issues.
</P>
<P>
This time around, he added, the two sides have agreed to put
military cooperation on a purely "pragmatic" footing.
</P>
<P>
He said if Turkmenistan is interested, Russia will propose ways
to upgrade Turkmen military equipment, particularly its aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Economist Wins Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Robert A. Mundell of Columbia
University in New York won the Nobel Prize for economic sciences
Wednesday for his analysis of monetary and fiscal policy under
different exchange-rate regimes.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian-born economist "has established the foundation for
the theory which dominates practical policy considerations of
monetary and fiscal policy in open economies," the Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences said.
</P>
<P>
Mundell's most important work was done in the 1960s, the
academy said. He served in the research department of the
International Monetary Fund from 1961 to 1963, which "apparently
stimulated Mundell's choice of research problems; it also gave his
research additional leverage among economic policy makers," it
said.
</P>
<P>
He published a pioneering article in 1963 on the short-term
effects of monetary and fiscal policy in an open economy, the
citation said. "The analysis is simple, but the conclusions are
numerous, robust and clear."
</P>
<P>
"Mundell's considerations, several decades ago, seem highly
relevant today," the academy said. "Due to increasingly higher
capital mobility in the world economy, regimes with a temporarily
fixed, but adjustable, exchange rate have become more fragile;
such regimes are also being called into question," the academy
said.
</P>
<P>
It added that Mundell's analysis has important implications for
the single European currency launched by 11 members of the
European Union.

<P>
LONDON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. mediator George Mitchell
brought his Northern Ireland peace mission to London on Wednesday
from Belfast, hoping that a change of venue would ease tensions
between the negotiators.
</P>
<P>
British officials declined to disclose exactly where the talks
were being held, saying they don't want a media circus, and
Mitchell would not be issuing a statement in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
They added that Mitchell would depart for the United States on
Friday and return to Belfast next week.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said on Tuesday that his mission to resolve Northern
Ireland's political deadlock was at a crucial stage and that he
was shifting the venue for this week's talks to London.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. Senator is holding talks with politicians from
the province's pro-British Protestant majority and mainly Irish
republican Roman Catholic minority in an attempt to end a lengthy
impasse over guerrilla disarmament and the establishment of a
power-sharing executive.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said it was his "firm belief" that his peace push
could succeed.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell has so far failed to make a breakthrough in the first
five weeks of his mission, which is backed by the British and
Irish Republic governments.

<HEADLINE> Falling Fertility Rates Concern Singapore Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong Wednesday voiced his concern over the falling fertility
rate in his country, saying "this is a serious problem."
</P>
<P>
Goh highlighted his warning when he joined in the debate in
Parliament on the President's Address delivered on October 4,
1999.
</P>
<P>
Goh said "Our Total Fertility Rate or TFR has fallen steadily
since 1990, despite our scrapping the "Stop At Two" policy and
encouraging married couples to "Have Three Or More If You Afford
IT."
</P>
<P>
He said the government has warned against this trend since 12
years ago and tried to reverse it, but the efforts "have not been
successful."
</P>
<P>
According to Goh, a population is considered to be replacing
itself if it can maintain a TFR of about two, but the TFR in
Singapore has fallen steadily from 1.87 in 1990 to 1.5 in 1998."
</P>
<P>
"1998 was the year of Tiger so one would not expect a large
number of births, but the year of the Rabbit (1999) has not been
prolific either," he said.
</P>
<P>
The number of births in the first eight months this year is
three percent lower than that of the same period last year and
this will bring the TFR for 1999 below 1.5, he added.
</P>
<P>
Giving more details, the prime minister said there should be at
least 50,000 births a year in Singapore to provide the minimum
cohort size to sustain economy, defense and other manpower needs,
adding he made the point clear in 1987 when he announced the
government's new population policy in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Gon laid his emphasis to the fact that the actual birth number
were nowhere near the 50,000 mark in the past five years with only
43,664 births registered in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Goh precautioned that if this declining fertility trend
persists, his country's citizen population of three million will
grow to about 3.5 million by 2030 and then start to decline.
</P>
<P>
After 2030 the proportion of older people then will be far
higher compared to what it is today, people in the working-age
group will be fewer and the 3.5 million Singaporeans in 2030 may
not produce sufficient wealth to look after the needs of the old
and society in a general, he warned.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister attributed the falling TFR to urbanization,
education, changing lifestyles, singlehood and late marriage.
</P>
<P>
He tried to draw special attention to the problems that the
more educated mothers will likely have fewer kids and about one
fifth women with post-secondary qualifications is likely to remain
single in her life time.
</P>
<P>
Predicting that the TFR will fall even further as the education
standard of Singaporeans goes up, Goh concluded that the
government must try to increase the marriage rate of women,
particularly those with higher education, and encourage married
couples to have more births.

<HEADLINE> China Should Add Value of Farm Produce: U.S. Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. agricultural expert today
called on China to attach great importance to increasing the value
of farm produce through deep processing.
</P>
<P>
This will help increase farmers' income and relieve the
economic burden on government and consumers, said Dr. T.C. Tso,
board chairman of the Institute of International Development and
Education in Agriculture and Life Science.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tso is here to attend the International Symposium and
Exhibition on Fruit and Vegetable Processing Technology and
Industrialization, which is now in progress in the coastal city of
Yantai in Shandong Province, east China.
</P>
<P>
China is a big producer of farm products, and the output of
cotton and rape seed ranks number one in the world. However, the
scholars and officials at the seminar all believe that most of
China's farm products go to market without being processed,
leaving farmers only a small profit for their hard work.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Dr. Tso said, if corn, for
instance, is only used directly as feed, its value is very low.
However, corn can be refined to produce maize oil, starch,
monosodium glutamate, degradable plastic film, and forks and lunch
boxes, all of which are of much higher value than the corn itself.
</P>
<P>
Increasing output is a less efficient and perhaps harmful way
to promote profit, said Dr. Tso, because the output increase is
usually accompanied by a greater consumption of water, fertilizer
and pesticide, which cause pollution and waste natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tso, who once served as advisor in the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, regards a farm as a factory, and believes that
agriculture production should be considered in an overall manner,
like plans for a factory.
</P>
<P>
In order to add the value of farm produce, a thorough plan
should be made to arrange each step properly, including planting,
harvesting, preservation, transportation and marketing.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tso said that increasing the value of agricultural products
also depends heavily on technological improvement, and therefore
greater investment in related research is absolutely required.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Pakistan's Coup Leader Pervaiz Musharraf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The following is a profile of
General Pervaiz Musharraf, Pakistan's chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff Committee (JCSC) and army chief of staff, who led a coup
Tuesday evening overthrowing the government of Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf was born in August 1943, and is known as a humble,
well-mannered and thorough professional soldier. Soft-spoken
Musharraf has served in the Special Services Group, the elite
commando force of the Pakistani Army.
</P>
<P>
His close associates and those who have served with him say
that Musharraf is always helpful towards his colleagues and used
to take personal interests in the problems of even the most junior
under his command.
</P>
<P>
As army chief, Musharraf started his tenure in October 1998
replacing former Army Chief Jahanjir Karamat. Musharraf had an
excellent working relationship with the government of Nawaz Sharif
for about half a year.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed chairman of the JCSC in April this year and
his tenure as JCSC chairman and army chief was extended by one and
half year at the end of September till October 2001.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between the government and the army
deteriorated after the Kargil crisis in disputed Kashmir this
summer.
</P>
<P>
Apparently General Musharraf did not like too much the
interference by the government in the affairs of the armed forces
and a propaganda initiative launched at the behest of the
government to defame the institution.
</P>
<P>
Till the last few weeks, the army chief had been receiving all
government functionaries, the prime minister and federal cabinet
ministers outside his office and always saw them off cordially.
</P>
<P>
But the Sharif government's incessant habit of not letting
institutions work in their own sphere led the armed forces to the
situation where intervention was thought necessary.
</P>
<P>
Sharif Tuesday announced the sacking of General Musharraf both
as the chairman of JCSC and army chief, and appointed Lt. General
Ziauddin, chief of Inter Services Intelligence, as his successor.
</P>
<P>
However, the army led by Musharraf defied the government order
and staged a coup.

<P>
Joining the discussion were corporate leaders from such

<HEADLINE> HKAA Reports Encouraging Figures for Cargo, Passenger Throughput </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Air cargo throughput grew by
more than 25 percent in September over the same period last year,
while passenger numbers grew some 6.3 percent during the same
period, the Airport Authority (AA) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
While the provisional figures for September released Wednesday
showed encouraging trends, AA analysts cautioned that the figures
should be viewed in light of the adverse conditions prevailing in
the same period last year during the regional economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
The September figures showed signs of an overall improvement.
Although there was a slight decline (minus 1.1 percent) in the
number of flights, passenger numbers grew by 6.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
It also appeared that passenger numbers were returning to their
historic seasonal patterns established before the recession.
</P>
<P>
Two typhoons -- one of them the most severe storm to hit Hong
Kong since 1983 -- affected operations at the airport.
</P>
<P>
On September 17, the day after Typhoon York, the airport set
two throughput records: 122,000 passengers and 7,200 tons of air
cargo.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Step Up Efforts to Clean Polluted Rivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will step up
efforts to clean up polluted rivers in the country, Science,
Technology and Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There are 16 of the 120 rivers in Malaysia categorized as
polluted, 71 partly polluted and 33 classified as clean, according
to the minister.
</P>
<P>
"River pollution in Malaysia has not reached a critical stage,
but still, we need to implement efforts to clean up our rivers,"
Bernama news agency quoted Law as saying in Putrajaya near here
after a weekly cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The minister said illegal factories, illegal settlements and
illegal waste disposal are the main causes of river pollution, and
urged the Department of Environment to step up monitoring efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Environment has formulated a river basin
management and rehabilitation plan at the cost of 3 million
ringgit (about 800,000 U.S. dollars), which covers aspects such as
identifying every source of pollution and detailed steps of
cleaning-up and rehabilitation.

<HEADLINE> Western China Creates Cross-Century Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Government heads of 10 provinces
and autonomous regions in western China gathered here in the
capital of Qinghai Province this week to draw a blueprint for
economic development of this resources-rich region in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of the State Development
Planning Commission, said the region should give priority to
ecological improvement, water resources exploitation,
infrastructure construction, and the improvement of living
standards for the people.
</P>
<P>
Western China comprises Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shaanxi,
Gansu and Qinghai provinces, Chongqing Municipality, and Tibet,
Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions. It covers a
total area of 5.4 million square kilometers and has a population
of 285 million, accounting for 56 percent and 22.8 percent of the
national total, respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the region's per capita gross domestic product makes
up only 60 percent of the national average of the country's total.
Most of China's poverty-stricken counties are located in this
region, and consequently, it is of vital importance to accelerate
the economic growth of western China, Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government adopted a series of measures to speed up
economic development of central and western China beginning in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The region should seize this golden opportunity to work hard,
be bold and creative, and act in a scientific manner, Zeng said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Officials on Humanitarian Mission to Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Sergio Vieira de
Mello Wednesday visited Baidoa town in one of the famine-stricken
regions of southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
U.N. aid workers described the visit of a 12-member delegation
led by Mello as a fact-finding mission regarding the humanitarian
situation in the Bay region as a whole and the town of Baidoa in
particular.
</P>
<P>
Bay and Bakol regions had been battlefields for the factions of
Hussein Mohamed Aidid and the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA)
since September 1996 until June this year when the RRA took its
control.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Baidoa said that the delegation was made to travel
 throughout the war ruined dusty streets of the town.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Abdi Tall, who is in charge of the town, has declared
the region as a war-ravaged and famine-stricken zone similar to
that in 1992 when Baidoa was labeled as the "death town".
</P>
<P>
According to the aid workers, the U.N. delegation is also
scheduled to drop by in the port town of Merca, 120 kilometers
south of capital Mogadishu, on two-hour-long visit Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Merca is one of the main ports used by the World Food Program
and the other agencies for delivering the badly-needed aid
supplies for southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian delegation started its eight-day tour from
Kenya Monday and the officials from U.N. agencies and the European
Union will also go to Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of their mission is to gain a first-hand
understanding of many complex issues facing the region and also to
raise awareness of the needs of affected population in the region.
</P>
<P>
The delegation made the visit when the death rate exceeds more
than 23 people per day in the 10 districts of Bay and Bakol
regions in relation with famine precipitated by droughts, lack of
water, food shortage, mal- nourishment and diseases such as
malaria, tuberculosis, measles and diarrhea.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Unfazed About Popularity Rate Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Wednesday he is more concerned about fulfilling his
promise to give the poor a better deal under his administration
than the drop in his popularity rating.
</P>
<P>
As the leader of the Filipino people, the president said he has
to make unpopular decisions that will, in the long term, serve the
best interest of the greater number of Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he could have easily sustained his high rating if
he had chosen to shirk his responsibilities by adopting lame
policies and decisions that will make him look good to some
quarters even if such would later prove harmful to the people.
</P>
<P>
"To me, the more important concern is what I can do to serve
our country," he said in response to Pulse Asia's latest survey
showing that his popularity rate dropped from 73 percent in May to
61 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
The president said in a news release that when the country is
facing difficulties, such as the latest rounds of oil price
increases dictated by global markets, he has to "gamble" his
popularity in order to make correct decisions.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, although my heart bleeds, I have to make an
unpopular decision for the sake and for the interest of our
people," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said the decline in the
president's popularity "is not unexpected," pointing out that "he
has been faced with difficult situations calling for unpopular
measures from his office."
</P>
<P>
But Barican noted that Mr. Estrada's popularity "remains at a
very high level." The president, he added, is hopeful that the
people will eventually realize that all his actions and decisions
are "in the interest of the majority."
</P>
<P>
According to Barican, the president's campaign for
constitutional corrections on economic matters "continues to be
the primary cause of heated debates and unfair attributions of
malice and ill motives."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets PNG FM (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
met with Papua New Guinea (PNG) Foreign Minister Michael Somare
here today.
</P>
<P>
Hu called Somare an old friend of the Chinese people, who has
made important contributions to the growth of friendly ties
between China and PNG for years.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that since the establishment of diplomatic relations 23
years ago, bilateral ties have developed steadily thanks to the
concerted efforts of both sides.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese President Jiang Zemin had a meeting with PNG Prime
Minister Mekere Morauta during the annual APEC summit this year,
during which the two leaders had an in-depth exchange of views for
the expansion of bilateral ties," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu, Morauta reiterated PNG's adoption of the "one
China" policy during the meeting, thus laying a solid foundation
for the continuous healthy development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Both China and PNG are in the Asia-Pacific region and are
either member state or dialogue partners of APEC and the South
Pacific Forum, he noted. "We have no conflict of fundamental
interests, but share common interests in many regional and global
issues," he pointed out. Economically, the two countries are also
compatible with one another, he added.
</P>
<P>
At the turning point of the century, the continuous growth of
bilateral ties are in the long-term and fundamental interests of
the two countries and peoples, he said, adding that China attaches
importance to such growth.

"China will continue to build the mutually beneficial and
cooperative relationship with concerted efforts from both
countries," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Somare extended warm congratulations for China's achievements
of the past 50 years. "I myself signed the communique for the
establishment of diplomatic ties between our two countries 23
years ago when I was PNG prime minister. The Chinese government
has made efforts to thoroughly change the face of China and has
promoted its prosperity and development during that period," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that PNG is also a developing country in the process of
seeking its destiny and reaching its goals, adding that his
government cherishes friendship with China and hopes to learn from
China's experience.
</P>
<P>
"PNG has made and will continue to make efforts to push forward
its ties with China in the past, at present and in the future," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Somare reiterated his country's "one China" policy, support for

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Silent on Pakistan's Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government on
Wednesday remained silent on the coup in Pakistan which ousted
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif overnight.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravinatha Aryasinghe told Xinhua
that "we are watching the developments (in Pakistan)."
</P>
<P>
He was tightlipped about the coup's influence on the upcoming
summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC), which will be chaired by Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC is scheduled to hold its 11th summit in Nepal in
November this year to plan its future development for the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
"It is too early to say Pakistan will boycott the SAARC summit
as there are six weeks left," said A.W. Khan, a Pakistani
journalist based in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistani Chief of Army Staff Gen. Pervez Musharraf,
who was sacked by Sharif Tuesday and then reportedly initiated the
coup, met with Indian Vice Chief of Army Staff Lt. Gen. Chandra
Shekhar over the weekend in Colombo when they were invited to
attend the 50th anniversary of the Sri Lankan army.
</P>
<P>
Khan said it was unclear now what the next step Musharraf will
follow, to declare martial law and stay in power or bring in a
caretaker government and hold elections three months later.
</P>
<P>
He said it could happen in the way 22 years ago when then
Pakistani chief of army staff Zia Haq took over the power and
declared martial law for 11 years.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Asks Teachers to End Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo has appealed to striking teachers of all learning
institutions to return to classrooms for the interests of the
nation and students.
</P>
<P>
"Please give us a chance by calling off the strike action, as
this is a responsible government, which is already striving to
improve the system," the Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper,
Wednesday quoted him as saying in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The president, represented by Education Minister Tunde Adeniran,
said the government has looked into problem of unpaid salary
arrears for teachers and is trying to improve the service for
primary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
The strike has entered the third week. The teachers insisted
that they would not return to classrooms if their January to March
salaries are unpaid.
</P>
<P>
This is the second strike by school teachers since Obasanjo's
civilian government came into power. The first strike was staged
in June by primary and secondary school teachers.

<HEADLINE> Empowerment Still Dream for Most Indian Woman Politicians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- If the recent elections in
India are any indicator, the fight for a bill to reserve over 30
percent of parliament seats for woman politicians has a long way
to go, though most parties have been crying themselves hoarse for
years.
</P>
<P>
Although the number of seats for women in Lok Sabha, the lower
house of the Indian Parliament, has increased to 47, four more
than that in the last house, the percentage has not even touched
10 percent while it was only six percent in the last house.
</P>
<P>
Of the 4,648 contestants to 537 seats for which elections were
held, 277 were women and only 47 of them managed to win.
</P>
<P>
Though this figure of 8.7 percent is no more than a third of
the one-third representation that political parties have been
talking about, the present proportion of women has more than
doubled the number who were able to make it to the lower house in
the first post-independence polls in 1952.
</P>
<P>
According to figures available from India's Election
Commission, seven major political parties together fielded 103
women contestants from their cumulative total of 1,300 this year.
</P>
<P>
Among these parties, the Congress fielded the highest number of
51, which was about nine percent of the total nominations of 453
filed on its tickets, still much less than the 33 percent
reservation it has been speaking about.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of representation that the other parties granted
to women was even less with a mere 7.6 percent of the candidates
of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and even lower in the
case of most of its 23 allies.
</P>
<P>
The figures for left parties including the Communist Party of
India (Marxism) and the Communist Party of India hovered around
the seven percent mark.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the common refrain of political parties from
fielding many women candidates is that it is difficult to find
those with winning chances, spokespersons of various parties have
gone on record as saying.
</P>
<P>
Women activists, however, question the criteria that decide the
winnability of a candidate.
</P>
<P>
In a society like India, unless further social reforms are
carried out and women from within the party and with the right
aptitude are given opportunity, the female gender will continue to
be ignored.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Population Control, Nigeria's Tough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Mr. and Mrs. Harry at the Garki
General Hospital in Nigeria's capital Abuja got a pleasant
surprise early Tuesday morning when informed they had just given
birth to the country's first baby to mark the United Nations "Six
Billion Day".
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian couple were even more happy to know that the
Charted Bank Limited, a Nigerian private bank, would pay for the
boy's education. This means that they don't have to worry about
the newly born baby's future while most of the west African
country's parents are bearing helplessly the negative outcome
brought about by unchecked population growth in such a poor
country like Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed the
planet's six billionth human being into the world at a maternity
hospital in Sarajevo, Bosnia. Nigeria, as the most populous
country in Africa, has received special attention from the world
in this activity to mark the worldwide celebration of the Six
Billion Day.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony held in Garki Hospital, the couple and their
newborn were congratulated by officials from the UN's Population
Fund (UNFPA) and ministers of the Nigerian government.
</P>
<P>
Bill Musoke, chief of UNFPA's Nigeria office, told the
gathering that Tuesday's baby searching in Nigeria is aimed at
underscoring the importance of education and private partnership
in population control in the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo said last week that the
country's population has hit something like 120 million, further
consolidating Nigeria's status as the world's most populous black
country. One out of five residents in Africa lives in Nigeria
right now.
</P>
<P>
Too fast population growth has made the country's unsatisfied
economic performance even worse. According to data provided by the
World Bank, in 1982, Nigerians enjoyed a fairly comfortable life
with an annual per capital income of 1, 200 U.S. dollars, while in
1997, each of them could only net in 270 U.S. dollars every year
on average, making Nigeria one of the 20 least developed countries
in the world.
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons behind this drop, a Nigerian official
congressman told Xinhua recently in Lagos, the country's largest
city, saying that unchecked population growth is certainly one of
the major causes.
</P>
<P>
The annual economic growth rate in the oil-producing country
has been fluctuating around two percent in recent years. But the
country's population is expanding at a speed of 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria will double its population in the next 25 years if it
keeps the current growth rate, experts with the UNFPA' s Lagos
office said.
</P>
<P>
They said it is very difficult to implement family planning in
Nigeria because of its unique political and religious backgrounds.
A survey carried out by the Nigerian government last year showed
that only six percent of its population took contraceptive
measures.
</P>
<P>
That is why education and private sector's role is so important
in population control in this country, Musoke said.
</P>
<P>
The more education women in this country have, the more aware
they become of their choices, the UN official said.

<HEADLINE> HK to Start Infrastructure Works of Proposed Science Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Territory
Development Department (TDD) Wednesday awarded a contract worth
176 million HK dollars (22.5 million U.S. dollars) to provide the
necessary supporting infrastructure to the proposed Science Park.
</P>
<P>
The infrastructure works will include the construction of a
dual two-lane carriage way of about 850-meter long in the south of
Pak Shek Kok development area where the Science Park is located,
passing through the eastern campus of the Chinese University of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The works will also include the construction of a pedestrian
and cyclist bridge, two cyclist subways, noise barriers, a sewage
pumping station and a 2.2-kilometer-long twin sewer rising main.
</P>
<P>
Ancillary works on drainage, landscaping and reprovisioning of
existing facilities at the seafront will also be carried out.
</P>
<P>
The works will start on Friday for completion in about 24
months.
</P>
<P>
According to the consultancy study commissioned by the TDD in
1997, the Pak Shek Kok development area is reserved for the
construction of a science park, housing development as well as for
the use of strategic recreation and tertiary education.
</P>
<P>
The proposed 22-hectare Science Park, expected to be built over
a period of 15 years in three phases, is for the formation and
growth of knowledge and technology-based business. Based on the
planning assumptions, about 16,500 job opportunities could be
provided in the Science Park when it is fully developed.

<HEADLINE> HK Land Registry Trading Fund Achieves Huge Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Land Registry
continues to operate successfully as a self-financing trading fund
government department with achievement of a net profit of 63
million HK dollars (8.07 million U.S. dollars) for the year ended
March 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
This represents an annual rate of return of 14.8 percent on
average net fixed assets, as compared with the target of 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
The above figures were released in the sixth Annual Report of
the Land Registry Trading Fund tabled by Secretary for Planning,
Environment and Lands Gordon Siu in the Legislative Council
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This outturn, despite the substantial drop in business volumes,
reflects a rigorous control over operating expenses and will
enable the Land Registry to continue investing in large scale
information technology projects to bring about even more improved
services," Land Registrar Anthony Cooper said in the report.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that during the financial year, the Land
Registry did not increase statutory fees.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Land Registry's Strategic Change Plan (SCP)
outlined in the Annual Report would enable it to establish by 2001
a fully computerized and integrated land registration and search
system.
</P>
<P>
"When the SCP has been fully implemented, the world will look
to the Land Registry for best practice in land registration," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Regrets Over Coup in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Wednesday expressed regret over the military
coup in Pakistan Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"To me, that incident is very regrettable," Mahathir said,
adding the military should be a professional body following the
orders of the government of the day which was elected by the
people.
</P>
<P>
If the military was inclined towards politics it would be quite
difficult for a country to progress with a smooth administration,
he told reporters after meeting a delegation of the Malaysian
British Business Council in Putrajaya near here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said whatever faults Sharif might have, "he was still
elected by the people."
</P>
<P>
"Everyone must respect leaders who are elected by the people.
If there are people who disagree with Nawaz Sharif, they should
wait until the election is held," he said.
</P>
<P>
During an election they could use all the facilities of a
democracy to elect a good leader, he said, adding "but taking over
power by force is something inappropriate."
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Islamabad, Pakistani Army Chief Gen.
Pervez Musharraf Tuesday evening took over power to save the
country from ruin.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will commence
digital terrestrial television (DTT) broadcasting within two years,
subject to satisfactory completion of a technical trial currently
underway.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Secretary for Information Technology and
Broadcasting K. C. Kwong at the Asia Pacific Electronics Symposium
1999 and Intelligent Transportation Technologies Forum organized
by the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Kwong said that following the completion of the 1998 Television
Policy Review, the government decided to proceed with a technical
trial with a view to determining the most suitable DTT standard
for adoption in Hong Kong. The government has since established a
government-industry steering committee to coordinate the trial.
</P>
<P>
"We have so far conducted tests on two of the three prevailing
DTT standards and we expect that the whole trial would be
completed in early 2000," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our target is to commence DTT broadcasting within two years,
on satisfactory completion of the trial, but we will allow
simulcast of analog and digital television broadcast in Hong Kong
in the initial stage," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are making good progress towards paving the way for the
early introduction of such services," he said, adding that since
the end of last year, the three local radio broadcasters had been
conducting a technical trial of digital audio broadcasting (DAB)
with a view to establishing the feasibility of territory-wide
coverage of DAB signals.
</P>
<P>
"With the benefit of and taking into account the findings of
the technical trial and the consultancy study, the government
would formulate policy proposals on DAB for consultation with the
industry and the community next year," Kwong said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Population Control, Nigeria's Tough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Mr. and Mrs. Harry at the Garki
General Hospital in Nigeria's capital Abuja got a pleasant
surprise early Tuesday morning when informed they had just given
birth to the country's first baby to mark the United Nations "Six
Billion Day".
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian couple were even more happy to know that the
Charted Bank Limited, a Nigerian private bank, would pay for the
boy's education. This means that they don't have to worry about
the newly born baby's future while most of the west African
country's parents are bearing helplessly the negative outcome
brought about by unchecked population growth in such a poor
country like Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed the
planet's six billionth human being into the world at a maternity
hospital in Sarajevo, Bosnia. Nigeria, as the most populous
country in Africa, has received special attention from the world
in this activity to mark the worldwide celebration of the Six
Billion Day.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony held in Garki Hospital, the couple and their
newborn were congratulated by officials from the UN's Population
Fund (UNFPA) and ministers of the Nigerian government.
</P>
<P>
Bill Musoke, chief of UNFPA's Nigeria office, told the
gathering that Tuesday's baby searching in Nigeria is aimed at
underscoring the importance of education and private partnership
in population control in the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo said last week that the
country's population has hit something like 120 million, further
consolidating Nigeria's status as the world's most populous black
country. One out of five residents in Africa lives in Nigeria
right now.
</P>
<P>
Too fast population growth has made the country's unsatisfied
economic performance even worse. According to data provided by the
World Bank, in 1982, Nigerians enjoyed a fairly comfortable life
with an annual per capital income of 1, 200 U.S. dollars, while in
1997, each of them could only net in 270 U.S. dollars every year
on average, making Nigeria one of the 20 least developed countries
in the world.
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons behind this drop, a Nigerian official
congressman told Xinhua recently in Lagos, the country's largest
city, saying that unchecked population growth is certainly one of
the major causes.
</P>
<P>
The annual economic growth rate in the oil-producing country
has been fluctuating around two percent in recent years. But the
country's population is expanding at a speed of 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria will double its population in the next 25 years if it
keeps the current growth rate, experts with the UNFPA' s Lagos
office said.
</P>
<P>
They said it is very difficult to implement family planning in
Nigeria because of its unique political and religious backgrounds.
A survey carried out by the Nigerian government last year showed
that only six percent of its population took contraceptive
measures.
</P>
<P>
That is why education and private sector's role is so important
in population control in this country, Musoke said.
</P>
<P>
The more education women in this country have, the more aware
they become of their choices, the UN official said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Business in Major Pak Cities Usual After Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 13 (Xinhua) -- It was business as usual in
Pakistan's major cities Wednesday after the military coup Tuesday
by the Pakistani army under Army Chief General Pervaiz Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
In the backdrop of changed political scenario, it was normal in
Karachi, the commercial hub of this South Asian nation on
Wednesday morning, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Calm prevailed in the southern port city, with people taking to
their routine life in a normal fashion. Buses and wagons loaded
with commuters heading toward their respective work places could
be seen since early morning.
</P>
<P>
All educational institutions remained open in the city with
students flocking in at usual pace.
</P>
<P>
The busiest point in Karachi, the Empress Market was also
bustling with heavy rush of public buses and other vehicles.
Vendors there were little concerned about the fresh political
developments in the country.
</P>
<P>
Small groups of daily wage earners sat on pavements, listening
to newspapers read out for them by any of their fellows.
</P>
<P>
Qadir Baksh, one of the listeners, said, "I wish Allah would
now have mercy on us and provide us with a capable and honest
leadership."
</P>
<P>
He also appeared to be very realistic in acknowledging that the
nation itself also needs to review its actions, deeds and be
forthright in its dealings.
</P>
<P>
In the provincial capital of Quetta, complete normalcy also
prevailed Wednesday morning. All government offices, educational
institutions and business centers were open as usual.
</P>
<P>
However, banks remained closed for public dealing in the wake
of the announcement made by the State Bank of Pakistan late
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
PIA (Pakistan International Airline) flight operation was also
normal and Karachi-Quetta-Islamabad flight arrived on time.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday morning army soldiers had taken positions at all
important government installations including radio and television
stations.
</P>
<P>
Frontier Corps personnel have withdrawn from these buildings
after initially taking over them Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Local administration, in the meantime, has imposed the
concerned section for maintaining law and order situation,
prohibiting assembly of four persons or more and carrying of fire
arms.
</P>
<P>
Wall chalking and tinted glass in vehicles have also been
banned. These orders will remain enforced for two months if not
withdrawn earlier.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lahore, the hometown of deposed prime minister Nawaz
Sharif, the capital city of Islamabad and Peshawar, capital of
North West Frontier Province, were also calm. The army has taken
full control of the situation, and no unexpected incident has been
reported.

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee Gravely Concerned Over Pakistan Developments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee Wednesday expressed grave concern over
developments in Islamabad, saying that vigilance on the
international border with Pakistan had been intensified but the
"situation is normal".
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee told the press shortly after being sworn in as prime
minister for a third term to lead a National Democratic Alliance
(NDA) government that his country had taken all precautions
against any possible adverse fallout.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about the developments in Pakistan. We are
monitoring the situation and keeping ourselves fully informed,"
Vajpayee said following the first meeting of the new Council of
Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Saying that it was for Islamabad to create the right climate
for resumption of stalled dialogue between the two neighbors, he
said that India's policy towards Islamabad was "consistent and
principled".
</P>
<P>
"We wish the people of Pakistan well. We remain committed to
developing friendly relations and cooperative ties with Pakistan
based on mutual trust and confidence for which the government of
Pakistan needs to create the right environment," the Indian leader
said.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet Committee on Security will meet shortly afterward
to consider the latest developments in Islamabad, which were
triggered by the dismissal of Army Chief Pervez Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Indian Army Chief V. P. Malik said that political
instability in Pakistan "is not a good thing for India".
</P>
<P>
A senior defense official said late Tuesday night that Indian
armed forces went on a "state of full alert" following reports of
a possible attempted coup by the army in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
"All the three wings of the armed forces are on full alert and
we are monitoring the situation closely," the official said.

<HEADLINE> Commander: Air Raids to Continue Until Eliminating All Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian warplanes will continue
to bomb rebel targets in Chechnya "until all the rebels are
eliminated" in the breakaway republic, Russian air force commander
Colonel General Anatoly Kornukov said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kornukov said that the federal forces have eliminated "
practically all of the targets revealed".
</P>
<P>
Both Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev have refused to rule out sending ground troops to Grozny,
the regional capital, saying that the rebels will be targeted
wherever they are.
</P>
<P>
The federal offensive against the rebels came after Chechen-
led militants infiltrated the neighboring Daghestani republic and
made several explosions in Moscow and two other Russian cities
that killed more than 300 people. Islamic Chechen rebels were
believed to be behind the explosions.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of military operations in August against
the rebels in Daghestan and Chechnya, Russian aircraft have flown
over 2,000 missions, Kornukov said.
</P>
<P>
"In Chechnya alone, more than 100 rebel targets have been
destroyed. Federal air forces have destroyed the rebels' entire
infrastructure," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The China Symposium for the '99
International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) Day
was held here today under the auspices of the China National
Committee for IDNDR (CNCIDNDR).
</P>
<P>
Today is the 10th International Disaster Reduction Day as
designated by the United Nations. This year's topic "Benefits of
Disaster Reduction -- Technology Protect Lives and Property" aims
to summarize the disaster reduction experiences of all countries
and continue this work into the next century.
</P>
<P>

's natural disaster reduction efforts, the application of
technology in this work, and the related international exchanges
and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the tasks for the 21st century, he said, "The work of
disaster reduction is an important part of sustainable development
in China, and it can ensure the country's economic construction
and social development."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the "National Disaster Reduction Plan of the

<HEADLINE> China's Exports Show Positive Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China's exports during the
first nine months of the year grew by 2.1 percent, according to
figures released today by the General Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
In September alone, export volume surged 20.2 percent to 18.6
billion U.S. dollars, raising overall exports in the first nine
months to 137 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports in the January-September period rose 19.3 percent. As a
result, the overall import and export volume of the country
climbed 9.4 percent to 254.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that positive growth is a result of the fast
economic recovery in Asia, which had been hit hard by the Asian
financial crisis. China's exports to those economies now have
resumed remarkable growth.
</P>
<P>
China's exports to Hong Kong and Russia were still negative in
the nine months, but the margin of decline shrank compared with
that in the January-August period.
</P>
<P>
Exports to the United States grew by 10.7 percent between
January and September, and exports to Japan rose 6.7 percent, to
the Republic of Korea, 19.5 percent, and to Taiwan, 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, experts say that policy incentives such as the
higher rate of tax rebates for certain export goods have also paid
off.
</P>
<P>
Among export commodities, industrial goods in particular, along
with electric and machine merchandise, increased sharply.
</P>
<P>
Traditional export products, including textiles, clothing,
footwear, travel items and suitcases, and toys have also resumed
growth.

<P>
LAGOS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's House of
Representatives has rejected a request by the U.S. Secretary of
State, Madeline Albright, to address a joint session of the
National Assembly on October 20.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria William Twaddell sent a letter dated
on October 6 to the Speaker of the House, Alhaji Ghali Na'Abba,
conveying Albright's request to address a joint session of the
assembly, according to a "New Nigerian" report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Adopting a motion against the request, majority of the members
argued that according to parliamentary conventions, only heads of
government could address joint session of the assembly.
</P>
<P>
Contributing to the debate, Alhaji Adamu Bulkachuwa from Bauchi
State said that the position of the U.S. secretary of state could
not be placed at par with that of the president.
</P>
<P>
"The issue before us now is that of national pride and Nigeria
is no less a nation than the U.S.", he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In his argument, Obeten Obeten from Cross River State noted
that when Nigeria's speaker of the House visited the U.S.
recently, "not even a speaker from one of the states of the
country came to welcome him."
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Ibrahim Zailani from Bauchi State insisted that only
heads of government be qualified to address a joint session of the
National Assembly, adding that it would be wrong to allow a
minister to address a joint session of the assembly because "she
is an American."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Hopes to Expand Economic Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan said here Wednesday that Iraq hopes to expand
economic and trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan made the remark when meeting with visiting Chinese
Deputy Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Zhou Keren
who arrived here Monday for the 10th session of Chinese-Iraqi
Joint Committee of Economic, Trade and Technical Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The vice president praised China's participation in the
oil-for-food program. The U.N. program allows Iraq to sell limited
amount of oil every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said that Chinese companies should gain better
understanding of Iraq's market requirements in order to expand
bilateral economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Zhou Keren expressed China's willingness to
continue cooperation with Iraq within the framework of the
oil-for-food program, and hoped Chinese companies' share in will
increase.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Chinese government, Zhou offered 5 million
yuan (about 600,000 U.S. dollars) as humanitarian aid to the Iraqi
people. This indicated the deep sympathy of the Chinese people
with the sufferings of the Iraqi people under the nine-year-old
economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations in 1990, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 10th session of the Chinese-Iraqi joint committee
co-chaired by Zhou Keren and Iraqi Industry Undersecretary Ahmed
Rasheed kicked off on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the session, Rasheed stressed Iraq's keenness on
expanding domains of economic and trade cooperation with China to
serve the two countries' interests.
</P>
<P>
Zhou expressed pleasure over the progress achieved by the joint
committee, saying Chinese companies won contracts valued at over
600 million dollars under the oil-for-food deal in foodstuffs,
spare parts and machineries of oil, agriculture and electricity
fields.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed bilateral cooperation in trade, health,
oil, finance and industry fields during the session.

SHENZHEN, October 13 (Xinhua)-- The Shenzhen Special Economic
Zone in south China collected 10.16 billion yuan in customs duty

These collected duties have surpassed the yearly target by 43.8

<HEADLINE> Iran Behind New Terror Threat: PNA Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
has accused Iran of inciting Islamic terrorists to carry out
attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jibril Rajoub, head of the Palestinian Preventive Security in
the West Bank, was quoted on Wednesday as saying Tehran was
encouraging terrorists in order to torpedo progress in
negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
According to the Jerusalem Post newspaper, Rajoub said "Iran is
supporting and aiding Islamic militants in an attempt to spoil the
peace process."
</P>
<P>
Iran recently invited members of militant Islamic groups,
including Hezbollah, or Party of God of Lebanon, Hamas, or Islamic
Military Resistance Movement of Palestine and Islamic Jihad, or
Islamic Freedom Fighters to encourage them to resume attacks on
Israel, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranians had told them "to go to liberate Jerusalem," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's warning this week of
potential terror attacks against targets in Israel and abroad
stemmed from Palestinian intelligence information, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) are
coordinating well in security matters.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Hamas issued a statement saying it is ready to
halt attacks against Israeli civilians, on conditions that Israel
stop settlement activities and expropriation of Palestinian land,
and the Israel Defense Forces and settlers stop harming
Palestinian civilians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a special parliamentary session Tuesday in honor of
visiting Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Barak repeated
his call to world leaders to unite to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
A coordinated and determined effort in the political,
diplomatic, security and intelligence spheres would ultimately
defeat terror, he said.

Ereshenko Vladimir, head of the Russian delegation at the
defense export exhibition (DefExpo) which opened on Tuesday, told
the press here that some more modern fighter aircraft would soon
be deployed in the IAF to enhance its strike capability.
</P>
<P>
For the last 30 years, Russia had been catering to Indian
defense needs and supplied with the country a variety of weapons
including aircraft and tanks.
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful to complete upgrading the fighter planes as per
schedule," said Vladimir, who represents Rosvoorouzhenie, a
federal state unitary enterprise that is dedicated to
representation of the Russian defense industry.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase, he added, two fighter planes would be
upgraded in Russia by January 2000 and the work would be carried
out later in India.
</P>
<P>
On the supply of SU-30 fighter planes, he said, "work on this
project is going on smoothly and the two countries are hopeful of
completing the project according to the schedule."
</P>
<P>
However, he refused to answer questions regarding the transfer
of technology in manufacturing the SU-30 fighters.
</P>
<P>
The five-day DefExpo show, specializing in land and naval
system, is held with an aim to promote export of Indian defense
equipment to third world countries.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Defense
and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) with the
participation of official delegations from 28 countries and 117
foreign companies from 16 countries.
</P>
<P>
As a showcase of India's defense technology, the exhibition
reflects the increasing interaction between public and private
sector industries in the area of defense production in the country
and, for the first time, 24 small-scale industries of the country
are exhibiting their products at the international show.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for India to display a wide range of
foreign and home-made defense equipment and latest information
technologies including heavy-duty equipment and telecommunications
facilities.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Host Largest Trade Fair in Southeast Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Board of Investment
(BOI) will hold next year the largest trade fair in the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region, BOI
Secretary-General Staporn Kavitanon said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fair, called BOI Fair 2000, will also be the largest in
Thailand in the past 40 years, Staporn said in an interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"It is the largest in ASEAN in terms of area and participation.
The fair will be held in a 1 million-square-feet
(929,000-square-meter) area and we expect 3 million people to
attend the fair," he said.
</P>
<P>
The fair, to be held on February 3-17 next year on the
outskirts of Bangkok, aims to help jump-start the Thai economy in
the new millennium by showing the best side of the Thai industries
and products.
</P>
<P>
The fair will consist of exhibitions from Thai industries,
industry workshops and a trade fair for selling Thai-manufactured
consumer products.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 seminars will also be held during that period of time,
Staporn said.
</P>
<P>
"The campaign is to build up confidence and communicate to the
world that Thailand's economic situation is getting better," he
said.
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday, 58 pavilions with 734 booths and 385 pieces of raw
space had been booked in the fair. And 920 other booths have been
reserved.
</P>
<P>
Charoen Pokhaphand Group, Thailand's largest agro-industry
conglomerate, will have six pavilions in the fair, making it the
largest participant in the fair.
</P>
<P>
BOI Fair 2000 is a cross between an industrial exhibition and a
trade show, where the general public, professionals and investors
can meet and visit.
</P>
<P>
Staporn also urged foreign investors to invest now in Thailand,
quoting the cheaper land price, labor and increased efficiency as
the reasons.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, many economic figures indicated that the
country is on the right track to recovery.
</P>
<P>
As for the recent fluctuation in the currency and stock
markets, he said that the Thai economy, like a patient who has
just undergone a big operation, has stopped bleeding.
</P>
<P>
"He needs to stay in the hospital for a while before getting up
to play," he said.

MANILA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government formed
Wednesday a new task force to combat the entry of hot items to the
country, according to a statement of Philippine President Joseph
Estrada.
</P>
<P>
The president said in the statement that he wants the newly
created anti-smuggling unit, dubbed Task Force Aduana, to turn up
the heat on smugglers and make them feel the full force of the
law.
</P>
<P>
"The time to act forcefully to clean up the smuggling
syndicates is now," he said, adding that smuggling has deprived
government of much-need revenues and diminished public confidence
in his anti-smuggling drive.
</P>
<P>
According to Estrada, Task Force Aduana would consist of the
Presidential Security Group, Intelligence Service of the Armed
Forces and the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency.
</P>
<P>
The president also ordered the task force to coordinate with
the Department of Justice for the speedy prosecution, and to
secure the conviction of smugglers.
</P>
<P>
Operatives of the task force, he said, would be scattered all
over the country "to arrest and to go after smugglers."
</P>

"They were directed not only to seize the smuggled goods but
also to file charges and see to it these smugglers will be
prosecuted in court," said the president.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The world governing body of
athletics has formally cleared Sri Lankan sprinter Susanthika
Jayasinghe of doping charges, according to local press report here
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) had sent a
letter to the local Amateur Athletic Association exonerating
Jayasinghe, the Island newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe's agent said last month that the IAAF had cleared
her of the charges in July, but preparations for the world
championships in Seville, Spain, had delayed an IAAF announcement
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe, silver medalist in the 200 meters at the 1997 world
championship in Athens, quit the 100m and 200m events at the world
championships in Seville, due to injury.
</P>
<P>
Tested positive for a banned steroid, Jayasinghe was suspended
in April last year, but the ban was lifted four months later after
a local hearing.
</P>
<P>
Unhappy over the inquiry, the IAAF referred the case to an
arbitration panel. But a hearing scheduled for April was put off
after Jayasinghe's lawyers said they were keen to produce fresh
material before the committee.

GAZA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators have reached an understanding in principle Tuesday
evening on the release of the second batch of Palestinian
prisoners from Israeli jails due for this week.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will resume talks Wednesday in an effort to
resolve differences once and for all, said Palestinian Minister of
State of Prisoners Affairs Hisham Abdul Raziq.
</P>
<P>
Terming Wednesday's negotiations as "decisive", the minister
said that the Palestinian side would reject any new terms that are
not included in the memorandum of Sharm el-Sheikh signed in
September on the release of detainees.
</P>

The two sides had reached agreement on the names of certain
detainees, a matter that aroused differences in the course of
Tuesday's negotiations. The names of the detainees will be
submitted to the two sides for approval, the minister was quoted
by the Voice of Palestine radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side adamantly insisted on the release of 150
detainees who had been charged with carrying out operations
against Israel before September 13, 1993 and were detained before
May 4, 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli side tried to substitute 35 detainees with

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Chip giant Intel Corp. and
the American Medical Association said Tuesday they are developing
an online system to verify people who dispense medical advice via
the Web are indeed doctors.
</P>
<P>
Intel system verifies only an individual's identity, not the
site's content, according to Richard Corlin, speaker of the House
of Delegates of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledges that a separate system must be developed to
sort out good and bad medical information.
</P>
<P>
The first system, expected to be in place early next year, will
require doctors using a participating Web site to register for a
digital certificate, akin to an online health card.
</P>
<P>
Intel computers will check the registration information against
the American Medical Association's database of 900,000 doctors.
</P>
<P>
Such a system will be crucial for the next wave of Internet
health care applications, which could let doctors share lab
results and diagnose patients electronically, experts say.

<HEADLINE> Ousted Pak PM Shifted to Unknown Destination: Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The deposed Pakistani prime
minister, Nawaz Sharif, was shifted to an unknown destination
early Wednesday morning, informed sources told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif, whose 31-month-old government was dismissed by
the army Tuesday, was put under house arrest as the army led by
Army Chief General Pervaiz Musharraf moved in to take over the
control.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement late Tuesday night, the Inter Service Public
Relations said that Sharif, his brother Shahbaz Sharif and the
chief of Inter Service Intelligence, Lt. General Ziauddin, are
under "protective custody."
</P>
<P>
Sharif sacked General Musharraf as army chief Tuesday afternoon
and appointed Ziauddin as the new army chief.
</P>
<P>
However, almost two hours after the announcement, army soldiers
took over major government buildings and airports throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
Sharif has been arrested for the first time since he entered
politics in 1981. His first government was ousted through a
presidential order under defunct article 58 (2)b of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
In his short televised address to the nation early Wednesday
morning, General Musharraf, who is also chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff Committee, blamed Sharif for politicizing the army
and creating dissent in its ranks.
</P>
<P>
Confusion still marks the army takeover as the army chief
detailed no definite plan about the future set-up.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Many U.S. Firms Not Ready for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A study released this week
claimed that many large companies in vital U.S. industries are far
from prepared for the new millennium, despite their widespread
confidence.
</P>
<P>
Based on the study of their publicly disclosed Y2K budgets and
expenditures conducted by Weiss Ratings Inc., a U.S. provider of
Y2K readiness ratings, many companies in such industries as
pipelines, telecommunications and airlines ranked "low" or "below
average" in their Y2K preparedness.
</P>
<P>
In the Weiss Y2K rating scale, "low" and "below average" are
considered unfavorable ratings, implying a warning to investors.
Although not intended to be an exact evaluation, the firm said,
the Weiss Y2K ratings are believed to provide an approximate
indication of each company's relative progress.
</P>
<P>
But there are companies disagree with Weiss's survey results,
finding fault with the methodology of the study.
</P>
<P>
Overall, among the 552 Fortune 1000 companies making complete
disclosure on Y2K budgets and costs in their second quarter 1999
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the aggregate
budget estimate is 30.5 billion U.S. dollars. But only 19.6
billion dollars of those budgeted funds had been allocated to
actual expenditures, according to the firm.
</P>
<P>
All other factors being equal, a company should have spent at
least 70 percent of its budget by mid-year in order to qualify for
a Weiss Y2K rating of "average."
</P>
<P>
In the telecommunications industry, 73.3 percent of the 19
rated companies were either "low" or "below average."
</P>
<P>
Among companies involved in oil, gas and pipelines, five of the
six rated were given unfavorable marks.
</P>
<P>
Even in the U.S. airline industry, supposedly further along in
fixing its computer systems than its counterparts in most other
countries, half of the eight firms got ratings of "low" or "below
average."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, industries that were feared to be potential Y2K
disaster areas, such as banking and electric utilities, have made
"major strides," the firm said.
</P>
<P>
Other major industries with a relative large percentage of
lagging companies were diversified outsourcing services,
scientific, photo and control equipment, pharmaceuticals, food
services and chemicals, according to the ratings.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial and
commercial city of Shanghai has been inhabited for more than 6,
000 years, according to archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion is based on the discovery of 28 sites of ancient
cultural remains and 540 ancient tombs in the city over the past
years.
</P>
<P>
Some of the sites, where many valuable items of relics were
unearthed, date back to as early as the Neolithic Age.
</P>
<P>
One of them features the Majiabang Culture, which is one of the
sources of Chinese civilization.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists excavated some 6,000-year-old rice grains and
other items of relics there.
</P>
<P>
The findings show that Shanghai was relatively developed at
ancient times, the archaeologists said.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Falls For 7th Straight Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus
decreased to 791.8 billion yen (6.9 billion dollars) in August,
down 32.7 percent from a year earlier, the Finance Ministry said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was the seventh consecutive month of year-on-year decline in
the surplus, due partly to a revision of the June data to a
shrinkage of 2.4 percent from the preliminary 0.7 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in goods and services trade totaled 206.2 billion
yen (1.8 billion dollars), down 63.5 percent for the second
consecutive month of decline, the ministry said in a preliminary
report.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise trade registered a surplus of 829.8 billion yen (7.
3 billion dollars), down 25.0 percent, with exports falling 6.4
percent to 3,597.5 billion yen (31.7 billion dollars), while
imports rising 1.1 percent to 2,767.7 billion yen (24.4 billion
dollars), the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official said the growth in imports is traced to
fast-increasing imports from Asia and rising crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The services deficit increased to 623.6 billion yen (5.4
billion dollars) from 540.7 billion yen (4.7 billion dollars) a
year earlier as more people traveled abroad.
</P>
<P>
The current-account balance is the difference between a country
's income from foreign sources and foreign obligations payable,
excluding net capital investment.
</P>
<P>
In August, the yen averaged 113.4 to the dollar, up 21.6
percent from a year earlier. The stronger yen was blamed for the
export slump in recent months.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Rose Growers Accredited European </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Six Zambian rose flower growers
have been accepted as certified members of the Netherlands'
Horticulture Environmental Project, which paves the way for them
to enter a very competitive and lucrative market in Europe.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the project runners in Zambia noted that the
six growers, with a total cultivated area of some 34.1 hectares,
would be assisted in producing high quality roses under strict
environmental regulations, Zambia's Daily Mail newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, through the certification, Zambia has
joined other African countries, including Zimbabwe, Kenya, Uganda
and Tanzania, under the project dubbed Milieu Project Sierteelt
(MPS).
</P>
<P>
"This means that the MPS qualification would be mentioned
behind their name on the auction dock in Holland, and for direct
sales these growers can make use of the MPS trademark," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The MPS is also active in Britain, Italy, Germany, France,
Switzerland and Portugal. Other countries which acknowledge the
project include Ecuador and Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, "a large proportion of flowers and
plants now come under the MPS, making MPS the leading
international environmental program in terms of production
volume."
</P>
<P>
The project also protects against flowers and plants piracy,
and offers growers a good image of abiding by cultivating under
environmentally friendly methods.
</P>
<P>
The MPS was introduced in 1995, and by April this year the
Dutch participants, with a cultivated area of 9,025 hectares,
represented more than 60 percent of the sales at the flower
auctions.

<HEADLINE> Irish Pilgrims Denied Entry to Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus police has denied entry
to a group of Irish pilgrims sent packing by Israel for allegedly
being "doomsday cultists", the Cyprus Mail newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 25 pilgrims, most of them Irish, arrived at Cyprus'
southern Limassol port Tuesday on a Cyprus-flagged cruise ship
after being turned away by Israel on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims then headed for Greece's Piraeus after being
denied entry to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus police said in a statement that there was "information"
that the group, including 16 Irish, eight Romanians and a
Colombian, had planned to commit mass suicide in the Holy Land to
mark the arrival of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
"They were not allowed to come ashore on Cyprus as they
refused to reply to any of the questions put to them by
immigration officials," said police spokesman Glafcos Xenos.
</P>
<P>
They were members of a "heretical group of unknown description
going under the name of Sekta," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police said the group belongs to an "extreme Christian
cult" and had tried to enter through Haifa port but they were
denied Israeli visas on two separate occasions.
</P>
<P>
Israeli authorities are concerned that a small number of the
millions of Christian pilgrims expected to deluge the Holy Land
for the millennium will be extremists bent on ushering in the "end
of the world" by provoking acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
The group claimed that they had wanted to take the handicapped
children to see the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
They had traveled across Europe by bus before getting on board
a boat to Cyprus on Sunday and then sailing on to Israel.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Islamabad in Quiet Waiting for Further Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Islamabad, the capital of
Pakistan, remained in apparent serenity Wednesday morning, waiting
for the policy statement of Army Chief General Pervaiz Musharraf
after the army dismissed the civil government in a late Tuesday
coup.
</P>
<P>
Lives for most people looked the same as used to be,
businessmen are busy in their shops bargaining with sporadic
customers, and schools keeping open for students.
</P>
<P>
Governmental functionaries were also in their offices, although
some cabinet ministers have reportedly been house arrested.
</P>
<P>
"Everything is normal till now, nothing special here," an
official from the Press and Information Department who required
anonymity told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
However, all banks have been closed for the time being because
the National Bank of Pakistan announced Wednesday a bank holiday
to avoid any panic flight of capital.
</P>
<P>
"Private foreign currency account holders are always the first
to transfer funds in the event of a major political crisis," said
an anonymous economic analyst.
</P>
<P>
The main road in the capital looked all the same as it was. No
troops were seen at the entrance of the road leading to the Prime
Minister's House where former Prime Minster Nawaz Sharif had been
house arrested.
</P>
<P>
More than a score of troops have controlled a building in
downtown belonged to Senator Saifur Rahman, who is the chief of
the Accountability Commission.
</P>
<P>
Two military vehicles were parked in front of the building and
a machine-gun is erected on the top of a vehicle. Two soldiers
politely refused the entry of outsiders into the building.
</P>
<P>
However, sources from News Network International, a private
press agency whose headquarters is set up in the building, told
Xinhua that they had been permitted into the building and their
work is not disturbed.
</P>
<P>
The army leaders have probably been contemplating on the next
step, said Akabir Rahman, a research fellow with the Institute of
Strategic Studies here.
</P>
<P>
"Today is the most crucial day because General Musharraf is
expected to announce how to steer the country within hours," he
said.
</P>
<P>
There were no comments on the political situation in the
country from parliamentarians and key figures available so far.
</P>
<P>
Most of the people have adopted a wait-and-see attitude before
the army's plan is disclosed, said Rahman.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move on Tuesday evening, the army sieged the
Prime Minister's House, seized buildings of Pakistan Television
and Radio Pakistan and sealed off international airports across
the country.
</P>
<P>
The coup came soon after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif declared
the removal of General Musharraf from the posts of chairman of
Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (JCSC) and chief of Army Staff
(COAS), making the latter the second top military leader sacked
since the Nawaz government took power in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf, who returned from a visit to Sri Lanka hours
later, presided over a high level army meeting after which he
announced the dismissal of the government.
</P>
<P>
In an early Wednesday morning address to the nation, General
Musharraf, accusing Sharif of trying to politicize the army,
destabilize it and create dissension within its ranks, said the
army's action was "a last resort" to "prevent any further
destabilization" in the country.

<HEADLINE> Israel Has Not Apologized: Jordanian Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Senior Jordanian officials
denied reports that Israel has apologized for last week`s Hebron
incident in which Jordanian law makers were harassed by Israeli
soldiers and Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
The semiofficial Jordan Times reported Wednesday that Deputy
Prime Minister and acting Foreign Minister Ayman Majali said his
government has received a letter from Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy explaining Israel`s position on the incident.
</P>
<P>
But the letter is not an official apology from the Israeli
government, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier press reports said Levy had said sorry in the letter to
the Jordanian government and expressed hope that bilateral ties
would not be damaged by the Hebron incident.
</P>
<P>
Actually, Levy echoed in the letter claims by Israeli officials
that the incident would not have occurred if the Jordanian
parliamentary delegation had coordinated with Israeli authorities
before their visit to the Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Levy`s message is not satisfactory and Jordan is still waiting
for Israel to carry out a full investigation into the incident and
to be informed of its results, an unnamed official was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has not asked for an official apology for the latest
incident but has demanded an Israeli investigation in a formal
protest to the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
The unhappy episode took place last Saturday when a 20-member
Jordanian parliamentary delegation headed by Lower House Speaker
Abdu Hadi Majali was prepared to visit the Ibrahim Mosque in the
West Bank city of Hebron at the end a four-day visit to the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
They were force to receive security checks by Israeli soldiers
and then heckled by some 15 Jewish settlers outside the mosque.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Israel withdrew its troops from four-fifth of Hebron
which is home to some 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish
settlers, but Israeli soldiers are responsible for the security of
the Ibrahim Mosque.
</P>
<P>
The mosque is also the site of the 1994 Hebron massacre in
which a Jewish fanatic killed 29 Muslim worshippers.

KUNMING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Officials and experts from the
World Tourism Organization (WTO) have said that Yunnan Province in
southwest China has potential to develop ecotourism.
</P>
<P>
They made the remark at a seminar on ecotourism held here

Yunnan is in the sub-tropics and is home to 26 ethnic groups.
The province is also well-known as a kingdom of animals and plants,
to go along with its many lakes and mountains.

<HEADLINE> National Day Holiday Boosts Sales in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The seven-day National Day
holiday boosted China's domestic market -- a good sign for the
sluggish domestic demand, according to Chinese economists.
</P>
<P>
Professor Chao Gang of the Shanghai University of Finance and
Economics said that this phenomenon shows that the problem of
inactive domestic demand is not mainly one of purchasing power,
but rather the lack of inspirational marketing and efficient sales
operations.
</P>
<P>
Fierce competition in the domestic market brought on by the
country's excess of products has obliged businesses to launch more
and better sales promotions that will lure shoppers.
</P>
<P>
Historically, Chinese go shopping more frequently during
extended holidays, such as the National Day and Spring Festival.
And people now are more concerned with nutrition and freshness
when food shopping.
</P>
<P>
To satisfy these needs, grocers in northeast China's Jilin
Province woke at dawn during this year's National Day vacation in
order to get fresh vegetables. Their work was rewarded, as profits
were big, though prices were much higher than usual.
</P>
<P>
"We will sell several hundred kilos of processed lamb, beef,
and meat daily, and our annual profits have been around 200,000
yuan (24,000 U.S. dollars)," said Fan Maofeng, who runs a business
in Changchun in Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
"It is the freshness that has attracted so many customers. My
employees will wash the meat clean at night and cook it early the
next morning," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
Before China's reform and opening-up policies started in 1978,
local governments had the final say on marketing strategies for
businesses which were mostly run by the state. And salesmen at
that time did not care much for the true needs of customers.
</P>
<P>
Now, the market-oriented reform, coupled with the current slow
domestic market, have brought new challenges to both public and
private businesses, which now must attract more customers with
high-quality goods at competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of people's living standards over the past two
decades has also changed attitudes towards fashion, with more
people concerned with trendy clothes and specialty items.
</P>
<P>
To please these consumers, businesses offer sales and discounts,
and free items to shoppers who spend a set amount. Salesmen
dealing in household electric appliances have improved their
follow-up services to better serve consumers.
</P>
<P>
"Problems seldom occur with such commodities, however, and
these measures have really, to some degree, increased sales," said
a sales manager at a Changchun shopping center.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the China Industrial and Commercial Bank
Guangzhou branch show that local residents drew over 46 million
yuan from the bank on October 1 and 2, ten times the amount of
deposits.
</P>
<P>
Effective marketing devices, together with the central
government's reduction of interest on bank deposits, levy of tax
on interest income from bank deposit, and increase in national
bond issues, have all boosted domestic demands.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that prices in Beijing and Shanghai
have stopped declining, and the storage volume of finished
products around the country is decreasing.

<HEADLINE> Israel Expands Orthodox Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Housing Ministry is
working on building a new ultra-Orthodox extension to the
settlement of Kochav Ya'akov, local daily Ha'aretz reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The settlement area, known as Tel Zion, south of West Bank town
of Ramallah, is only a few kilometers away from Jerusalem's
northern suburb. The permits for building the neighborhood were
granted by the former Benjamin Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted a ministry official as saying that the
overall plan for Tel Zion-Kochav Ya'akov includes 3,000 housing
units and some 2,000 are slated for the ultra-Orthodox community
and 1,000 for the national religious community.
</P>
<P>
Kochav Ya'akov settlement, founded 15 years ago, currently has
about 1,200 people.
</P>
<P>
Kobi Pikel, secretary of the settlement, told the daily that
Kochav Ta'akov and Tel Zion are a single settlement, forming part
of the ring of settlements that make up greater Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here said the big settlement expansions in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip will continue, despite the
government's intention to close some encampments.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak informed the Jewish settler leaders
Tuesday night that he plans to dismantle 15 encampments in the
West Bank at recommendations from the defense establishment,
Israel Radio reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that settlers built 42 encampments
throughout the West Bank since the signing of the Wye River peace
accord last fall and their legalities were all in question.
</P>
<P>
The settler leaders opposed the decision, saying Barak is
trying to satisfy the left and to sacrifice any number of
outposts as he likes.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi nation must
encounter natural calamities hand in hand by developing an
efficient management infrastructure as the country is one of the
worst disaster-prone areas of the world, Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are unable to stand economically because we are one of the
world's worst victims of natural disasters ... we must join our
hands to fight them (disasters) back," she said while launching
the "International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction Day '99"
at the Osmani Memorial Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to fight with mighty nature, but we have
to continue our struggle for survival," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the scientists and people related to disaster
management must work together to build up a sustainable disaster
management system based on science and technology in the future.
</P>
<P>
Apart form constructing more shelters, the subjects on
disasters were included in school and college text books to
generate awareness particularly among the young people, she said.
</P>
<P>
"We had observed the good effects of these preparedness during
the severe cyclone on May 19, 1997 and devastating and prolonged
floods of the century in 1998," she said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh lost more than 1,500 people in the 1998 flood and
138,000 lives during the devastating cyclone on April 29, 1991.
</P>
<P>
Natural calamities such as drought, flood and cyclone strike

<HEADLINE> Scientists Help Tibetan Farmers Win Good Harvests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Tibetan farmers used to depend on
lamas, or Tibetan Buddhist monks, to battle poor weather
conditions in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau at an average altitude of
over 3,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, however, modern science and technology are replacing
sutra-reading to assist local farmers in the Tibet Autonomous
Region in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
In the past, lamas were invited to read sutra when pests were
attacking crops, and yaks were driven to a lamasery when farmers
wanted to pray for the blessing of the God to fight a snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, local scientists have worked hard to persuade
Tibetan farmers to adopt science and technology, instead of their
traditional, superstitious ways. Sometimes, experiments had to be
made, as a Chinese saying goes: Seeing is believing.
</P>
<P>
Last year, an interesting experiment was conducted in Mangkang
County, a place of frequent hailstorms.
</P>
<P>
Local meteorologists used rockets to fight a hailstorm in a
valley, while in a neighboring valley, lamas were combating the
hailstorm by reading Buddhist sutras. The scientists won, of
course, and since then local Tibetan farmers have taken to the
modern way of combating hailstorms.
</P>
<P>
Currently, artificial anti-hailstorm methods are widely
accepted in Tibet, and the entire autonomous region consumes 3,000
rockets and 12,000 shells a year in the process.
</P>
<P>
A computerized rain-increasing center has been established in
Shigaze, a grain production base in Tibet, and in the future, all
Tibetan prefectures and counties are expected to have similar
centers.

<HEADLINE> Russia Lives up Hopes of Individual Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The error-prone Russian
gymnasts still lived up their hopes of winning individual titles
after their teams failed to gain the top honor of the team events
at the current Gymnastics World Championships here.
</P>
<P>
"China is too strong for the team title, but we still have
chances to win in the rings and other individual finals," said
Russian men's coach Evgeni Nikolko. Russia edged Belarus for the
silver medal through their efforts in the last apparatus event in
the team event on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
China won the men's team title for a fourth straight time, with
a overwhelming score of 230.395 points, ahead of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Alexei Nemov, Russia's top medal hope and world champion in
horse vaulting in the 1995 championships in Japan, failed to gain
a berth in the final but topped the qualifiers in the floor
exercises with 9,737 points.
</P>
<P>
He also finished fourth in the qualifying round to reach the
pommel horse final set for Friday. But the 23-year-old, who has
been suffering from shoulder injuries for a long time, was not
sure to be back in peak form for the glory.
</P>
<P>
"My strongest events usually are vault and floor exercises.
But since I have resumed systematic training for only one month, I
am not certain I can possess in this meet. I will try my best to
win a medal, " said the four-time horse vaulting world champion.
</P>
<P>
Nemov's teammate Alexei Bondarenko, 21, all-around runner-up in
the 1997 championships, was third overall, after Chinese Yang Wei
and Huang Xu in the qualifying competition.
</P>
<P>
Bondarenko booked berths in two finals -- in the parallel bars
with a top score of 9.812 points and in the floor exercises with
the second highest score of 9.712.
</P>
<P>
"I am free from injury. I hope I can dethrone defending all-
around champion Ivan Ivankov of Belarus for the men's title,"
Bondarenko said.
</P>
<P>
The blame for Russian's lower-than-expected team performance
might lie with their injured and inexperienced line-ups, as
Nikolko admitted.
</P>
<P>
"But experience that helped Nemov to show his best in the team
contest, will also work in the individual competitions," Nikolko
said.
</P>
<P>
On the women's side, Olympic and world champion Svetlana
Khorkina, who's nightmare fall off the beam allowed trailing
Romanians to capture the team title in the last rotation, now
faces a real battle to defend her all-around title.
</P>
<P>
Khorkina, at 1.64 meters a showcase of graceful artistry in the
sport, was gently embraced by Russia's head coach Leonid Arkaev,
when she broke into tears after her the grave mistake.
</P>
<P>
"We came here with a target of winning the women's team title
and we have the strength for the victory," said Russian coach
Marina Boulachenko.
</P>
<P>
"We would have never expected her to make such a mistake at
that decisive moment," she added.
</P>
<P>
Though Khorkina received a poor score of 9.075 points for her
beam routine, she managed a day-high 9.825 on the uneven bars
later on the day to be ranked third overall among 260 competitors.
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's all-around final, Khorkina will have to take
challenges from Romanians Maria Olaru and Andreea Raducan, ranked
1-2 on the qualifiers list as well as former all-around world
champion Simona Amanar.

<HEADLINE> Actuary Training Harvests in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- More than a dozen colleges in
China now offer actuarial courses and many qualified actuaries and
associate actuaries have become the elite of insurance companies
and supervision departments, according to a roundtable conference
on China's actuary education and research held here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Paul Thornton, president of the British Institute of Actuaries,
told the conference, which was sponsored by the Committee of
Actuaries under the Shanghai Institute of Insurance, that both the
number of actuaries and actuary education are growing in China,
and that he hopes a professional organization will be established
soon to internationalize China's actuarial science.
</P>
<P>
An actuary training program was launched last year by the
British Institute of Actuaries, the British Eagle Star Life
Assurance Co. Ltd., and Shanghai University of Finance and
Economics and 30 students have completed the first year's study.
</P>
<P>
Chen Debin, secretary-general of the Shanghai Institute of
Insurance, said that actuarial science is a professional method
for handling and controlling all risks of the insurance industry.
The study of actuarial science began in China in the late 1980s,
and has been developing quickly because China's prosperous
insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
Since the Society of Actuaries (SOA) in North America and China
's Nankai University started a program of actuary training toward
a master's degree in 1987, several similar programs have been
initiated at Chinese colleges including the People's University in
Beijing, Fudan University, and East China Teachers' University.
The SOA has also set up eight qualification testing centers for
actuaries in China.
</P>
<P>
China now has dozens of associate actuaries, and the first
internationally recognized Chinese actuary became qualified in
Shanghai last year.

<HEADLINE> China Approves 1st Comprehensive Securities Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Xiangcai Securities Co. Ltd.
has become China's first comprehensive securities firm officially
recognized by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC),
according to today's China Securities.
</P>
<P>
The firm, based in Hunan Province in central China, had
successfully increased its registered capital to over one billion
yuan by the end of August, four months after it was approved by
the CSRC to do so.
</P>
<P>
According to China's securities law, which came into effect on
July 1, securities firms with less 500 million yuan in registered
capital can only engage in brokerage business, while those with
more than 500 million yuan in registered capital, known as
comprehensive dealers, have a much broader revenue base with
access to new-stock underwriting and other business activities.
</P>
<P>
Since April, several other securities firms have been approved
to expand their registered capital to over 500 million yuan, but
Xiangcai is the first to officially accomplish this.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Greeting Cards Make Debut in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) will sell 900,000 greeting cards to local Chinese
communities for the first time this year, and all the proceeds
will go to help children in poverty-stricken areas improve their
education and health, a UNICEF official told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Today is the 20th anniversary of UNICEF activities in China,
and the organization wants to commemorate it by selling greeting
cards to Chinese communities.
</P>
<P>
It has also expanded sales operations from Beijing to Shanghai,
and coined a new slogan "UNICEF-Children's Friend" which it hopes
will one day become as well known in China as the name UNICEF is
already known in countries throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Net revenues from sales of the 900,000 cards spells resources
for immunizing 3.5 million children against measles, said the
UNICEF official.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xinggen, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, said that in the past two decades China has
had fruitful cooperation with UNICEF, which has provided almost
300 million U.S. dollars in assistance, helping China create more
than a hundred projects including immunization, basic education,
environment and hygiene, and aid to disabled children.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Hockey League Sees Drop of National Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada's National Hockey League
(NHL) has seen a drop of its players to 56 percent from almost 97
percent three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The NHL figures released on Monday indicated that the country
for the first time has shared its ice with 28 percent of Europeans
and 16 percent of those born in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Canadians made up nearly 97 of NHL's 12 teams in the 1967-68
season.
</P>
<P>
The trend is not yet at its bottom, according the NHL source,
which expects "the Europeans will keep going up."
</P>
<P>
In the June draft of junior-aged players, slightly more than a
third of the players chosen by NHL clubs were from Europe,
suggesting NHL rosters in the next few years will continue to have
more Europeans.
</P>
<P>
This year's number of Canadian players has already dropped five
percent from the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
Of the 661 players on the opening-night rosters of the 38 NHL
teams, 372 were Canadians, as compared with last season's 399.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the percentage of non-Canadian players is
partly attributed to a rising influx of east Europeans since 1989.
NHL currently has 50 players from the Czech Republic, 47 from
Russia and 10 from Slovakia.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices plunged in Tokyo
Wednesday, dampened by Tuesday's sharp decline on Wall Street,
with the key Nikkei index closing below 18,000 for the first time
in four trading days.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 336.32 points, or 1.86
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 17,754.49.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index, covering all First
Section issues, dropped 15.84 points or 1.03 percent to 1,526.96.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in New York,
which marked its second-largest one-day point loss this year, made
investors in Tokyo hesitant to buy stocks, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 658.51 million
shares from 692.73 million shares Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Share prices fell in most business sectors and export-oriented
technology issues were lower, hit by the unfavorable performance
in New York share prices, traders said.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector and the steel industry were the only sectors
to move up, they said.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers far
outnumbered gainers 899 to 320, with 115 issues ending unchanged.

<HEADLINE> "Air Car": Light Aircraft Production in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China's first 5-seat light
aircraft is in test production in Nanjing, capital of east China's
Jiangsu Province, and will be ready for test flights and large-
scale production next year.
</P>
<P>
Named AC500, the plane was developed at Nanjing University of
Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA), which enjoys a high
reputation in the field of aviation. The plane combines the latest
achievements of Chinese designers with the virtues of foreign
light aircraft. It is elegantly shaped, safe, and comfortable,
according to a source at NUAA.
</P>
<P>
The plane is 8.14 meters long and three meters high, with a
designed maximum speed of 250 km per hour, maximum voyage range of
800 km, and maximum flight elevation of three km.
</P>
<P>
Known as "air cars," 5-seat light aircraft have found a large
market worldwide, and are used for a variety of purposes, such as
helping victims of natural calamities, suppressing smuggling,
patrolling frontiers, protecting forests, and filming news footage.
</P>
<P>
The AC500 is expected to be very competitive in the
international market because its estimated price will be less than
two million yuan (about 242,000 U.S. dollars), which is much lower
than that of similar foreign-made planes.

JAKARTA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister and
Commander of the Military General Wiranto was chose by incumbent
President B.J. Habibie, the presidential nomination of the Golkar
Party, as the party's vice presidential candidate for the
1999-2004 period.
</P>
<P>
This was decided by Habibie at a meeting, which was
participated in by all of the Golkar's functionaries and regional
branches here on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar Party had reaffirmed the presidential nomination of
Habibie at the third Golkar Executive Board meeting which ended

</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, general chairman of the party Akbar
Tandjung said the meeting recommended Habibie to decide on one
among the four vice presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
Besides Wiranto, the three other candidates are Akbar,
Ginandjar Kartasasmita (coordinating minister for economy, finance
and industry) and Sri Sultan Hamengku Buwono X (Yogyakarta
Governor).
</P>
<P>
Akbar said if there is something that needs an urgent decision,
most of the party's regional branch boards agreed to recommend the
Golkar Executive Board to make the decision.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Akbar said, most of the regional branch
boards proposed a draft granting a mandate to the party executive
board to take special measures if the efforts to win Habibie face
a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The presidential election would be held on October 20, while
the vice presidential election on October 21.
</P>

of the National Awakening Party.

<HEADLINE> China's Colophony Exports in Great Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Hainan Forests Co., a stated-
owned company in southernmost China's island province of Hainan,
has reported colophony exports worth 450,000 U.S. dollars in the
first three quarters of this year.
</P>
<P>
Colophony, a by-product of pine-tree processing, is widely
needed in producing oil paint, soap, paper and matches. It
reportedly now has a soaring international market price, as high
as 480 to 500 U.S. dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
Hainan Forests Co. is a major colophony processing company in
the pine-tree processing base of Hainan, and all together has some
33,000 hectares of pine plantation area with 6,000 ha. used for
commercial purposes. The company obtained a direct export license
at the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
"Colophony processing is a profitable business with a sound
market. But we have to solve the bottleneck of raw materials,"
said one senior company official.
</P>
<P>
The company has the capacity to process 3,000 tons of colophony
a year, 70 percent of the island's total. This, however, has been
limited to some 2,000 tons because of a lack of raw materials.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak
informed the Jewish settler leaders Tuesday night that he plans to
dismantle 15 encampments in the West Bank, Israel Radio reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who held a meeting here with the settler leaders, said a
decision for the encampment evacuations would be forthcoming by
the end of the week and the implementation would take place
later. He gave them 14 hours to submit appeals.
</P>
<P>
Barak said his decision in this regard was based on the
recommendations from the defense establishment.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that settlers created 42 encampments
throughout the West Bank since the signing of the Wye River peace
accord last fall and their legalities were all in question.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a ministerial committee on settlements headed by
Barak discussed this issue and the committee empowered Barak to
decide whether to dismantle the outposts.
</P>
<P>
"I consider settlement activities in the West Bank, which was
always conducted at the behest and with the authorization of the
government, very important. But I think the law is of utmost
importance," Barak told the leaders.
</P>
<P>
The settler leaders opposed this decision, saying Barak is
trying to satisfy the left and to sacrifice any number of
outposts he please.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Construct Pipeline to Import Syrian Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon is to construct a
105-kilometer cross-border pipeline next year to import gas from
Syria, the Daily Star reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal signed between Syria and Lebanon, the 200 million
U.S. dollars pipeline is due to be completed before 2002 when
natural gas from Syria's Palmyra will be transported to Lebanon's
two new power stations near Tripoli, the country's northern port
city.
</P>
<P>
There is still the matter of final agreement between the two
governments which should be resolved shortly, Antoine Rabbat, a
consultant at the State Electricity Company, said at the 5th
Annual Middle East Gas Summit Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Two gas-fired power plants, each with a capacity of 450
megawatts (Mw), were completed this year at a cost of 600 million
dollars in a bid to boost Lebanon's generating capacity to 2,100
Mw from the current 1,200 Mw.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon needs about 9 million cubic meters of gas each day to
run all its power plants at full capacity. Syria has the capacity
to supply the 3 million cubic meters which Tripoli's new power
plants will consume.
</P>
<P>
"If everything goes according to plan, Lebanon will be able to
reduce the cost of electricity by 30 percent," Rabbat said, adding
that moving to natural gas as a source of energy was less
hazardous and more environmentally friendly than using fuel oil.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that private companies might finance the entire
deal with Syria if the power plants were privatized before the
pipelines became operational.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government wanted to make the power industry
appealing to private buyers.
</P>
<P>
"If we sell the power plants to the private sector, the
government will be able to save 300 million dollars each year on
salaries and maintenance work," Rabbat added.

<HEADLINE> China Holds First International Sand Sculpture Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China's first international
sand sculpture festival on Zhujiajian, a picturesque island in the
city of Zhoushan in east China's Zhejiang Province, has attracted
sand sculptors from 13 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the sculptors, including Gerry Kirk, president of the
World Sand Sculpture Association (WSSA), have created 21 sand
sculptures on island's beaches.
</P>
<P>
The festival began on October 3 and will continue until the end
of the month.
</P>
<P>
An international sand sculpture contest with the theme "Peace
And Friendship" is also in progress at the festival.
</P>
<P>
This event, along with two others held in Singapore and Japan,
have been sanctioned by the WSSA as the three major sand sculpture
contests in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Sand sculpture is an artistic form created over the past two
decades, and this is the first time Chinese artists have attended
an international sand sculpture contest.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Offers Initiatives to UN Special Session (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
offered eight initiatives in order to successfully convene a
Special Session of the UN General Assembly next year to realize
the goals of the World Summit for Social Development.
</P>
<P>
The World Summit, held in 1995, adopted the Copenhagen
Declaration and the Program of Action, and the Chinese government
has therefore presented a report including the initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The three-day Symposium on States, Markets and Social Progress:
Roles and Cooperation of Public and Private Sectors, co-sponsored
by the United Nations and the Chinese government, closed here
today where Chinese organizers made public the National Report on
the Implementation of the Outcome of the World Summit for Social
Development. The initiatives are the following:
</P>
<P>
-- The priority issues of the Special Session should be as
pragmatic and concentrated as possible. Poverty still plagues
developing countries, which have the majority of the world
population, and therefore the Special Session should continue to
focus on reviewing the issue of poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
-- On creating a favorable social development environment, the
Special Session should take into consideration the impact of the
financial crisis sweeping some countries upon the global community,
and should focus on reviewing ways to prevent such crises from
occurring again in the process of the constant development of
economic globalization.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Underlines Peace Based on Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami said on Tuesday that "peace can only prevail in the world
if people were to base their relations on justice."
</P>
<P>
Iran once again "stresses that no real and durable peace is
feasible unless it is based on justice and restoration of real
peace and prevention of crises is in the interest of all the
regional nations," said Khatami during his talks with visiting
Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret that the most vital aspect of this century
has been the prevalence of injustice, the Islamic Republic News
Agency (IRNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Iran's foreign policy of detente, Khatami said that the
position enjoyed by Iran among Muslim and regional countries and
that of Greece in Europe and the West has opened the venue for
peace and dialog between civilizations based on mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of Iranian-Greek ties is not detrimental to
either any government or nation, he said, adding that Iran has
always been a proponent of preventing escalations of crises.
</P>
<P>
The Greek president stressed the need to further expand the
Greco-Iranian political, economic and cultural relations and
voiced readiness of his country's public and private sectors in
helping expand bilateral economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Stephanopoulos arrived here Tuesday afternoon on an official
visit, the first by a Greek head of state since the victory of
Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979.

-- On the issue of equality and equity between men and women,
the Special Session should review this in combination with the
outcome of the implementation of the Beijing Declaration adopted
by the UN Fourth World Conference on Women.
</P>
<P>
-- Due to the universality of the relatively backward social
development in rural areas of vast developing countries, with
regard to the environment, poor population, employment, basic
social services, and resources allocation, the Special Session
should consider holding a special discussion on the issue of rural
development.
</P>
<P>
-- Due to the importance of community development, the Special
Session may consider reviewing ways to expand community services
to increase employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
-- The Special Session should continuously urge developed
countries to fulfill the agreed target of using 0.7 percent of
their gross national product for overall development assistance,
and offer a specific timetable and an operational plan.
</P>
<P>
-- The Special Session should carry out an evaluation of the UN
's role in international cooperation for social development,
including the timely release of reliable information relating the
successful experiences of all countries.
</P>
<P>
-- The Special Session should discuss ways of strengthening the
capacity of developing countries to manage their social
development, and may consider UN assistance in establishing
facilities for social development activities at regional and
national levels, such as policy seminars, information exchanges,
and personnel training workshops, conducted by the UN and its
regional institutions, member countries, or non-governmental

<HEADLINE> China to Establish Household Service Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China launched today a program
for the establishment of a nationwide household service network.
</P>
<P>
As the first step of this major program, Beijing will open a
hotline for providing standardized household services to Beijing
residents.
</P>
<P>
The program is jointly sponsored by the State Administration of
Internal Trade, the All-China Women's Federation, and the Central
Committee of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC).
</P>
<P>
Relevant departments will adopt a regulation for the
administration of the household service industry in a bid to
encourage its sound development.
</P>
<P>
The program is also seen as a way of providing employment
opportunities for those who have lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Surveys indicate that China has a great potential for
developing a household service industry. The household service
market potential for eight urban districts in Beijing alone is
estimated to be 1.6 billion yuan (192 million U.S. dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
These household services include taking care of babies, old
people and the ill, fetching school children, household cleaning,
and many other useful activities.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey shows that 20 to 30 percent of the people now
engaging in household services in China are laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Internal Trade will also offer
courses to train people to become household service workers.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Literacy Rate Below Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Nepal may not achieve the
target of making 67 percent of its population literate by the year
2000, Education Ministry officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The target to provide education opportunity for all by the year
2000 was set by the United Nations Education for All (EFA) Jomtien
Conference in 1990.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kathmandu Post newspaper Wednesday, officials
attending a two-day sub-regional EFA assessment workshop for South
and Western Asia said on Tuesday that Nepal's present standing on
achieving the literacy target rate set by "EFA Assessment for
South and Western Asia" by 2000 is "disappointing."
</P>
<P>
"Children in remote areas are deprived of basic education
opportunities as they have to assist their families in domestic
works," said Education Minister Prasad Upadhyay.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is spending 13 percent of the country's total budget on
education, out of which 50 percent goes for primary education.
</P>
<P>
Although government officials claim Nepal's literacy rate is 48
percent, the accepted literacy rate stands around 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Delegates of nine Asian countries are participating in the
workshop which is part of a world-wide exercise of the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
to measure the progress made in the last 10 years in providing
education to all children.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Growth Decelerates in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's tourism growth is
decelerating this year following the Visit Nepal Year 1998,
according to the data from the Immigration Office at the Tribhuvan
International Airport (TIA).
</P>
<P>
The data showed that total tourist arrivals only increased 5.5
percent in the first nine months of 1999, while in previous years
the growth rate by September used to reach around 8 percent, and
by the end of the year it would reach 10 to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
The total number of tourists entering Nepal through TIA till
September of 1998 was 272,762, whereas it is has merely grown to
287,768 this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Pradeep Raj Panday, chief executive officer at the
Nepal Tourism Board, this decline is mainly because of the poor
growth in the arrivals of Indian tourists, who constitute 37
percent of the total tourists arriving in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth of tourists from countries other than India
has not declined. In the first nine months of 1999, this part of
tourists is 10.54 percent higher than 1998, increasing from
164,531 to 181,867.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics of the first nine months of this
year, among these countries, the highest number of tourists coming
to Nepal is from the United States with over 22,000 tourists,
followed by Japan with 20,497, United Kingdom with 18,969, Germany
14,381 and France 12,998.
</P>
<P>
But India remains the largest tourism pocket for Nepal with
over 100,000 tourists arrivals by September.

BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji met
with Kamil Idris, director-general of the World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO), here today.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Zhu spoke highly of the WIPO, saying it has
played a vigorous role in China's process of building its
intellectual property rights (IPR) protection network and in
spreading IPR knowledge in the country.
</P>
<P>
In particular, Zhu expressed appreciation and thanks to the
director-general himself for his efforts to step up cooperation

Idris said that his organization will make greater efforts in
cooperation with China to make the country a model for the
protection of intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
The director-general, who is here attending an international

<HEADLINE> Boat-Shaped Huts Disappearing In Island Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Boat-shaped huts common to the
Li ethnic minority group in the mountainous areas of south China's
Hainan Province are disappearing, a sign that their standard of
living has improved.
</P>
<P>
There is a saying that Li people went across the sea from the
mainland by boats to the island a long time along, and when they
landed they built huts in the shape of boats made of mud and grass.
</P>
<P>
Although cool in summer and warm in winter, these shacks have
no windows to allow in fresh air and light, and they are very wet.
</P>
<P>
As Li people see more of the outside world, they also prefer to
live in brick houses that are more spacious and bright.
</P>
<P>
With the government's assistance of 100 million yuan over the
past six years, over 80 percent of the Li people have said
farewell to their shabby huts and have moved into some 120,000
houses.
</P>
<P>
Jiguimei, a woman who moved from Wuzhi Mountain two years ago,
told Xinhua that her hut used to catch fire easily, at least once
a year. But she did not suffer heavy losses, because she had
nothing to lose.
</P>
<P>
Now, her house occupies some 60 square meters of floor space
and has electricity and running water, and she works a large
orchard for her living.
</P>
<P>
As these changes occur, people fear that the disappearance of
the boat-shaped hut will represent a loss of their ethnic culture
heritage.
</P>
<P>
But various kinds of new boat-shaped huts were built, this time
not in the remote countryside, but in tourist villages. The huts
are used for rice wine mills and workshops at these resorts and
attract thousands of tourists every day.

<HEADLINE> Constructive U.S.-China Relations Critical to Global Economy: Summers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers said Tuesday that a constructive relationship
between the United States and China will be critical to the shape
and prosperity of the 21st century global economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an Asia Society's annual dinner here, Summers said
the United States can advance its fundamental interests and values
by working with China, by expanding the areas of cooperation and
by dealing forthrightly with differences between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Disagreeing with the ideas that a rising economic power with
millions of poor people within its borders is a threat to American
economic interests, Summers said "the truth is that an open and
prosperous China will best promote our national commercial
interests -- and it will best promote our broader national
economic and security interests."
</P>
<P>
"It is important to ensure in our relations with China that
our commercial interests are protected. But to seek to contain
China economically -- to keep it poor and to isolate it from our
markets -- is to see our long-term core interests precisely
backwards," he said.
</P>
<P>
Summers said the U.S. relations with China will open an
enormous export market to American producers and farmers. Even the
limited opening that has already occurred has quadrupled U.S.
exports to China in the past decade, to the point where an
estimated 400,000 American jobs now depend on them, he added.
</P>
<P>
Summers said the relations will support faster growth in
productivity and wages in China and that means faster real living
standards and higher demand for U.S. products in the future.
</P>
<P>
It will also provide a catalyst for broad economic and
institutional change that could help China in the 21st century
become the open, stable and prosperous observer of global norms
that the United States would all like to see, the Treasury
Secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Summers announced earlier today that the 12th meeting of Sino-
U.S. Joint Economic Committee will be held in less than two weeks'
time in Beijing. He expected that the discussions will focus on
international economic issues of mutual concerns, macro-economic
and structural questions facing China, international law
enforcement issues and the very live question of China's entry
into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Summers also spoke on China's economic achievements and talked
at length about challenges China faces on financial and state-
owned-enterprise reforms, and building the intangible
infrastructure of a market economy.

<HEADLINE> Empowerment Still Dream For Most Indian Woman Politicians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- If the recent elections in
India are any indicator, the fight for a bill to reserve over 30
percent of parliament seats for woman politicians has a long way
to go, though most parties have been crying themselves hoarse for
years.
</P>
<P>
Although the seats for women in Lok Sabha, the lower house of
the Indian Parliament, have increased to 50, seven more than those
in the last house, the percentage has not even touched 10 percent
while it was only six percent in the last house.
</P>
<P>
Of the 4,648 total contestants to 537 seats for which elections
were held, 275 were women with only 50 of whom having managed to
win.
</P>
<P>
Though this figure of 9.3 percent is no more than a third of
the one-third representation that political parties have talking
about, the present proportion of women has more than doubled the
number who were able to make it to the lower house in the first
post-independence polls in 1952.
</P>
<P>
According to figures available from India's Election
Commission, seven major political parties together fielded 103
women contestants from their cumulative total of 1,300 this year.
</P>
<P>
Among these parties, the Congress fielded the highest number of
51, which was about nine percent of the total nominations of 453
filed on its tickets, still much less than the 33 percent
reservation it has been speaking about.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of representation that the other parties granted
to women was even less with a mere 7.6 percent of the candidates
of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and even lower in case
of most of its 23 allies.
</P>
<P>
The figures for left parties including the Communist Party of
India (Marxism) and the Communist Party of India hovered around
the seven percent mark.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the common refrain of political parties from
fielding many women candidates is the difficulty of finding ones
with winning chances, spokespersons of various parties have gone
on record as saying.
</P>
<P>
Women activists, however, question the criteria that decides
the winnability of a candidate.
</P>
<P>
In a society like India, unless further social reforms are
carried out and women from within the party and with the right
aptitude are given opportunity, the female gender will continue to
be ignored.

<HEADLINE> Washington to Probe Alleged Civilian Massacre in Korean War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Tuesday received a
letter from U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen which pledges a
thorough investigation in the alleged civilian massacre by the U.S.
troops in 1950 during the Korean War, the South Korean
presidential office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. Defense Secretary Cohen stressed in his letter to
President Kim Dae-jung that the U.S. government will thoroughly
investigate the case with close cooperation with the South Korean
government," said a presidential office spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government will get the truth behind the case whatever
the investigation result is and thus leave no doubt in the minds
of the Korean people concerning the incident, said Cohen in his
letter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. defense chief also said Washington will compensate
the victims of the incident once the investigation result proves
it necessary.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press, quoting declassified U.S. documents as
well as testimonies from U.S. veterans who witnessed or
participated in the killings and from South Korean survivors,
reported earlier this month that the U.S. troops shot dead some
400 innocent South Koreans, including women and children, in 1950
in Noguri of North Chungchong Province, South Korea, as a
safeguard against disguised enemy soldiers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Sales Expected to Ease Slightly Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Record levels of home sales
in the United States are virtually assured for 1999, with the pace
expected to ease slightly next year, according to a report
released Tuesday by the National Association of Realtors (NAR).
</P>
<P>
Low unemployment, strong wages, brimming consumer confidence,
low mortgage rates and a soaring stock market have all contributed
to the robust housing market, the report said.
</P>
<P>
NAR expects existing-home sales to total 5.2 million this year,
up 4.8 percent over the record 4.96 million sales in 1998. The
association also projects 4.92 million sales for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The NAR report noted that the booming economy not only
accelerated the purchase of first homes by young people and non-
traditional buyers, but that it also increases the purchases of
vacation homes, a market segment that is more sensitive to stock
market wealth.
</P>
<P>
NAR forecasts new-home sales in 1999 to match last year's
record of 890,000, then ease to about 831,000 in the year 2000.
The median-price of an existing home for 1999 is projected to be
132,700 U.S. dollars, up 3.7 percent from 1998. At the same time,
the association expects the median new-home price to be 158,500
for 1999, up 4.3 percent from last year. The median existing-home
price is expected to rise only 1.4 percent to 134,500 dollars in
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
NAR said that mortgage interest rates will ease, expecting the
30-year fixed rate to decline in the fourth quarter, then average
6.7 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
The association expects housing starts to total 1.65 million
this year, an increase of 1.5 percent over 1998, then slip to 1.56
million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
NAR also forecasts growth in the real U.S. GDP to increase
slightly to 4.1 percent for 1999, then ease to 2.5 percent next
year.

<HEADLINE> Austria Faces Uphill Task in Government Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Final results released Tuesday
from October 3 national election revealed a dimmer picture for the
formation of a new government.
</P>
<P>
Austria's interior minister Karl Schloege announced that the
Social Democrats of Chancellor Viktor Klima came out first with 65
seats in the 183-member parliament, not enough to form a
government alone. They took 33.15 percent of the votes, down from
the initial 33.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The People's Party of Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel
finished joint second with the Freedom Party, pocketing 52 seats
in the parliament, but 415 votes fewer. The far-right Freedom
Party thus rose to the second largest party while the People's
Party fell to the third.
</P>
<P>
The Greens finished with 14 seats while the Liberal Forum
failed to secure the threshold 4 percent of votes.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel had threatened before the poll to bolt the 13-year
coalition with the Social Democrats and enter opposition if his
party fell below second place. The Social Democrats, however, have
indicated the willingness to continue cooperation with the People'
s Party and ruled out a coalition with the Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
Without the People's Party as a potential partner, it is
impossible for the Social Democrats to secure a parliamentary
majority.
</P>
<P>
Klima has not been authorized by President Thomas Klestil to
form the government. But even if he receives the authorization
mandate in the following days, it will still be difficult for him
to accomplish the task.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here have noticed that even if the People's Party
decided to back off from its threat to join opposition, it will
raise tough conditions unacceptable to the Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
President Klestil has urged party leaders to put aside party
interests and act in a responsible way. He has also called on the
current government to stay on. If the new government fails to
emerge within six months, the country will have no other option
but to hold another election.

<HEADLINE> 21 Arrested for Drug Trafficking in Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-one people were arrested
on charges of drug trafficking when Polish police busted a local
smuggling channel connecting South America Monday, police
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Polish news agency PAP quoted a spokeswoman with the
National Defense Bureau, Magdalena Klu Czynska as saying Monday's
haul also included a small amount of drugs and 100,000 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The newly-discovered clandestine drug route has been used since
1995 to bring in cocaine from Peru, Chile, Colombia and other
South American countries, she said.
</P>
<P>
The arrested suspects had two bases in Warsaw and the port city
of Gdanski, said the spokeswoman, adding Monday's operation was
part of an extensive anti-drug campaign launched since last May.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, a total of 2.5 tons of cocaine worth 200 million U.
S. dollars at black market prices have been smuggled into Poland
through various channels, she said.

<HEADLINE> British Telecommunications Exploring China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 13 (Xinhua)-- China attracts all the telecom
companies in the world and British Telecommunications will attach
special importance to tapping the huge market, said Alfred Mockett,
the CEO of BT Worldwide, here recently.
</P>
<P>
Mockett said the flourishing Asia-Pacific region, the
burgeoning Chinese market in particular, will be a major target in
BT's overseas undertakings in the next decade. BT has so far set
up 13 offices in the region's large cities and invested three
billion U.S. dollars since last October.
</P>
<P>
BT came to China in 1995 and its cooperation with China Telecom,
China's flag-carrier in the sector, began in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Marveling at the fast-paced development of China's
telecommunications, Mockett said it took Britain 132 years to
install 1.9 million telephone lines while China has laid 20
million lines in only one year. And China's mobile
telecommunications service is growing at an annual rate of 100
percent.
</P>
<P>
China's efforts to reform and open up its telecom sector will
unleash its mammoth market potential, he added.

DALIAN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Many state-owned enterprises in
Dalian, a coastal city in northeast China's Liaoning Province,
have moved into industrial parks.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that the city, as an important industrial
base in China, has moved 80 state-owned industrial enterprises out
of the downtown area to the parks since 1995. Relocation of some
another 50 are underway.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the moved firms have made 1.1 billion yuan
(132 million U.S. dollars) by way of selling the original
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises have upgraded technology and improved their
production techniques in their new sites by introducing new and hi-

</P>
<P>
The relocation project is expected to be completed within the
next two or three years.
</P>
<P>
The move has greatly reduced pollution in downtown Dalian.

<P>
YANGON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader
Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt said the reaching of world
population to six billion now has both positive and negative
aspects.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, the first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council, made the comment at a ceremony here Tuesday
marking the Day of Six Billion, official newspaper the New Light
of Myanmar reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, he said, it is the result of personal
choice and collective action for better health and longer life,
while on the negative side, he added, the poorest countries often
have the highest population growth rates and the worst
reproductive health -- the highest rates of maternal mortality and
the lowest rates of family planning use.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt stressed that international cooperation and
collaboration is of paramount importance to address the global
issues.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt disclosed that Myanmar is making plans to meet the
difficulties that may arise from the effect of growing population,
adding that virgin and fallow lands are being turned into
cultivable land to enhance food production.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Myanmar is taking every measure to meet the
challenges of the growing population.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's population has now reached 48 million with a 2
percent annual growth, according to official estimation.

GENEVA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- World number one Martina Hingis
struggled a little but advanced with a 7-6, 6-2 second-round win
over Russian qualifier Tatiana Panova on Tuesday in the European

Opening a 3-0 lead into the game, Hingis soon lost her

the quarter-finals.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Among Lowest Paid Countries in Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Mexico is among the lowest
paid countries in Latin America, with 40 percent of its people
living on an income of no more than two dollars each day,
according to a report published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the Labor University of Mexico, showed
that the country's per capita income rises to 3,500 U.S. dollars a
year for those who have permanent jobs (a third of the workforce),
compared with 4,500 dollars in Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Of the 4.5 million jobs created since 1994, 88 percent have
been paid a minimum between 100 and 150 dollars per month. What's
more, some 60 percent of these jobs was of a temporary nature.
</P>
<P>
The report also called for measures to be taken by the year
2000 to stimulate consumption to avert a steep contraction in the
domestic demand, adding that the purchasing power has suffered a
loss of 75 percent since 1977.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided that salaries should not increase by
more than 10 percent to avoid spiraling inflation, but the
opposition and labor unions argue that such a pay rise is far from
enough to help raise the purchasing power of the workers.

<P>
SOFIA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- President Peter Stoyanov has
asked Bernard Kouchner, the chief U.N. administrator in Kosovo,
for more information on the killing of a Bulgarian worker serving
with the United Nations in Pristina, said Presidential Press
Secretary Neri Terzieva on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission in Sofia said the victim, Valentin S. Kroumov,
38, was not on the Bulgarian police forces with KFOR, but joined
the U.N. civilian mission through independent channels, according
to Foreign Ministry Spokesman Radko Vlaikov. He arrived in
Pristina from Georgia of the United States where he was taking a
PhD course, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
"We are shocked by the killing," said Vlaikov, "it is a
barbaric act and brings forth the need to secure the necessary
conditions for the U.N. to carry out its rights and obligations."
</P>
<P>
Kroumov was attacked on Mother Teresa Street, Pristina Monday
evening by a group of ethnic Albanians, who dragged him 50 meters
down the street and killed him. He was said to have been killed as
he responded to an inquiry for time in Serbian, police said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission in Kosovo has contacted Kroumov's family and
promised to arrange their trip to Pristina to carry the body back
to Bulgaria. The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry also promised to
provide assistance to the family.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Basketball Legend Wilt Chamberlain Dead at 63 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. basketball legend Wilt
Chamberlain, who was larger than life both on and off the court,
died on Tuesday. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Police Department spokesman said Chamberlain was
pronounced dead of a heart attack at his home in Bel Air by
emergency medical personnel at 12:41 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Chamberlain was discovered in his bed and
not breathing by Joe Mendoza, a long-time employee who first
thought Chamberlain was sleeping.
</P>
<P>
One of the true great athletes of the 20th century, Chamberlain
was treated for an irregular heartbeat in 1992. The Hall of Famer
had been experiencing heart problems of late.
</P>
<P>
Chamberlain, who scored 100 points in a game and pulled down 55
rebounds in another, was one of the NBA's first giants and had
uncommon skills for a big man. At 2.16 meters, he could block a
shot, run down the loose ball, dribble the length of the court and
dunk. As an individual player, he simply was unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
Outside of basketball, Chamberlain's achievements were also on
a superhuman level. He was a high school track star, challenged
Muhammad Ali to a fight and Jim Brown to a race and claims to have
close relationship with 20,000 women.
</P>
<P>
"We've lost a giant in every sense of the word," said NBA
commissioner David Stern. "The shadow of accomplishment he cast
over our game is unlikely ever to be matched."
</P>
<P>
Rules at both the college and pro level were changed to try and
slow Chamberlain but had little effect. His presence brought on
the widening of the lane and limitations on inbound passes and
free-throw attempts.
</P>
<P>
Chamberlain holds 29 of the 41 top single-game scoring totals
and 10 of the top 15 rebounding games. His 31,419 points are
second all-time to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and his 23,924 rebounds are
the most in history.
</P>
<P>
In 14 years with the Philadelphia and San Francisco Warriors,
Philadelphia 76ers and Lakers, Chamberlain won the scoring title
seven times and the rebounding crown 11 times. Blocked shots did
not become an official statistic until after Chamberlain retired
in 1973 but he most certainly is the all-time leader.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Paraguayan President
Gonzalez Macchi criticized Monday Argentina and Uruguay for
granting political asylum "to fugitives from Paraguayan justice",
said reports from the Paraguayan capital of Asuncion.
</P>
<P>
The criticism came after Argentina and Uruguay "wrongly gave
political asylum" to two Paraguayan ex-generals wanted in Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
The two referred figures, allegedly involved in a coup, include
ex-general Lino Oviedo, who was in asylum since last March in
Argentina, and ex-defense minister Jose Segovia sheltered in

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Weak Confidence Affects Investment in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- While Asia is rebounding faster
than expected from a two-year old financial crisis, stock and
currency markets in the region have been sliding gradually in the
past few months and foreign bank lending throughout the region is
shrinking.
</P>
<P>
These signs show that weak confidence is causing a slowdown of
foreign investments in Asia, despite the region's on-going
economic recovery, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of this year, Asia's bourses rose
sharply after their contractions in 1997 and 1998. Regional
currencies also appreciated quickly.
</P>
<P>
But since July, Asian markets have been falling again. Hong
Kong stocks are down 10 percent from their highs of July, while
South Korean shares are down 20 percent. Both the Thai baht and
the Philippine peso depreciated to 41 against the greenback in
late September, the lowest in 11 months, before bouncing back this
month.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, the rupiah fell by 25 percent in two months
before recovering a little this month.
</P>
<P>
Although the jitters in Asian markets have not caused a panic
among foreign investors, as things in the region are slowly
returning to normal, the market slide reflected weak investor
confidence in Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have admitted that an economic turnaround has
become a reality now in Asia, but they are not satisfied with
reforms in the region's financial systems and corporations.
</P>
<P>
"The big money off the recovery has been made. Now Asia's going
to have to earn (future investment) by proving that all these
reforms are going to translate into earnings growth," said
portfolio manager Mark Headley of Matthews International Funds.
</P>
<P>
What worries foreign investors most is, perhaps, the slow
reforms in the region's financial system.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, non-performing loans still remains high, at 47
percent of total bank lending in July, but the government has so
far found no effective remedies for the problem.
</P>
<P>
If non-performing loans cannot be resolved, the economic
recovery cannot be sustained, economists said.
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, the stocks have been hit by worries of a
collapse of giant investment trusts. In Indonesia, the Bank Bali
scandal has weakened investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the problem in the financial sector, other
political and domestic issues are also weakening investor
confidence. In Indonesia, the problem in East Timor and constant
social unrest are the major factors causing jitters in its
financial market.
</P>
<P>
"The (Philippines) constitution now prohibits ownership of land
by foreigners and places very strict caps on how much foreigners
can own in certain companies such as in media and banking. That in
itself is an obstacle to investment," said fund manager Guy de
Tonquedec, referring to lower investments in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the higher U.S. interest rates and the strong yen are
also weakening investor confidence in Asian economies, where the
interest rates were cut by 7.8 percent on average in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. Fed raised interest rates in June and August,
Asian currencies began to look less attractive.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen has too added to investor uncertainty. The
strong yen, now around 105 against the U.S. dollar, has forced
Asian companies to buy yen to pay their debts to Japanese banks,
thus hurting regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
Because of weak confidence, the immediate prospects for foreign
investments in Asia are looking grim, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
"This year and next year I think it's still going to be very
weak," said uri Dadush, director of the economic forecasting group
of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report by the Institute of International
Finance, private capital flows to Asia this year will reach 39.3
billion dollars from 8.6 billion dollars last year, but will fall
to 26.8 billion dollars next year.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that Asian countries should speed up reforms to
attract foreign capital inflows. For Asian countries, they said,
foreign investments have become more important than in the
pre-crisis years, since many of their domestic banking systems are
still in bad shape.
</P>
<P>
Only a sharp rebound in capital flows to Asia will help spur
economic growth in the years ahead, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- India expressed grave concern
late Tuesday night over the latest developments in neighboring
Pakistan and is closely monitoring the situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Reports emanating from Pakistan are a matter of grave concern
and we are watching the situation," a spokesman of the Prime
Minister's office said here.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet Committee on Security would meet soon after the
swearing-in of the new government Wednesday to consider the latest
developments in Islamabad, which were triggered by the dismissal
of Army Chief Pervez Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who will take oath Wednesday as India's
next prime minister, was keeping himself fully informed of the
evolving situation in Pakistan, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
A senior defense official said that Indian armed forces went on
a "state of full alert" following reports of a possible attempted
coup by army in the neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
"All the three wings of the armed forces are on full alert and
we are monitoring the situation closely," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indian Airlines canceled its scheduled Airbus A-320
flight to Karachi shortly after midnight Wednesday due to
political uncertainties in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
An Air France flight from Chennal, south India, to Karachi was
diverted to New Delhi, airport officials said.

<HEADLINE> Confucianism Spiritual Source for 21st Century: Scholars (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Confucianism could be a major
spiritual source for peace and development in the world in the
21st Century, Chinese and foreign scholars said here.
</P>
<P>
These participants at the International Seminar on the 2,550th
Anniversary of the Birth of Confucius, held recently in Beijing,
noted that human beings must look for answers from Confucianism to
realize the goals of peace and development, the two major themes
of the coming century.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Tong Yun-kai of the Hong Kong Confucian Institute said
that Confucius' doctrine that people could remain at peace while
respecting differences will become a guiding principle in ensuring
the co-existence of various cultures and preventing wars.
</P>
<P>
While advanced science and technologies enable people to live
rich material and cultural lives, the current world is also marred
by the intense conflicts between individuals, races and countries.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Jia Shunxian from Sichuan University in China said that
if the world proceeds from the view that human beings are a big
family, all disputes could be resolved through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
According to Prof. Reginald Little from the Bond University in
Australia, Confucianism, as a concept which incorporates
traditional values, calls for a unified social environment and
moderate objectives, but does not ignore the changes and
uncertainties that occur in real life.

<TEXT>
<P>
Wan Bengeng, a scholar from the Science Academy of Sichuan
Province, noted that Confucianism has always placed great emphasis
on the harmony between man and nature.
</P>
<P>
The philosophy goes against the destruction of nature, the
depredation of natural resources, and calls for all creatures and
plants on the planet to be treated with kindness, Wan said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai University's Prof. Chen Zenghui agreed with this
belief, saying that it should become the engine propelling the
world's sustainable development in the future.
</P>
<P>
Mankind should draw many lessons from the wisdom of
Confucianism, he stressed, adding that if man doesn't develop and
use the planet's resources according to natural laws, he is sure
to be punished by Nature.
</P>
<P>
The scholars also discussed Confucius' theories of self-
reliance and struggle, saying that if human beings hope to succeed
in the next millennium, these attributes should be promoted.
</P>
<P>
Lee Kuan Yew, Singaporean senior minister and honorary chairman
of the International Confucian Association, cited the example of
South Koreans, who donated their valuables to the nation when it
was struck by the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Though this did not play a big role in helping the country out
of the mess, the people's spirit and unity has won international
respect, Lee noted.

<HEADLINE> Ruddock Punishment Would Be "Ridiculous" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- West Ham manager Harry Redknapp
insisted any punishment for Neil Ruddock following the Patrick
Vieira spitting incident would be "ridiculous."
</P>
<P>
The Arsenal midfielder was seen spitting at the Hammers
defender after being sent off in a recent game at Upton Park.
</P>
<P>
Vieira faces a severe punishment from the Football Association,
but Arsene Wenger believes Ruddock should also be disciplined for
his part in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Redknapp, though, has dismissed those claims from the Gunners
boss.
</P>
<P>
"It's absolute rubbish - a load of nonsense," said Redknapp.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get into a slanging match and I realize that
Arsenal are trying to help their player - but to suggest that
Ruddock should also be punished for that incident is ridiculous.
He didn't spit at anyone, did he?
</P>
<P>
"If the positions had been reversed and I thought my player
deserved to go then I would say so, and that would be the end of
it," Redknapp told the Evening Standard.
</P>
<P>
Vieira claimed he had been provoked into his actions by Ruddock
throughout the London derby, leading Wenger to call for the
authorities to find a way "to punish the provocateurs as well".
</P>
<P>
"If the FA punish people who react they have to surely punish
those who provoke. That is only fair," said Wenger.
</P>
<P>
"When I read that Ruddock was just playing the nice guy and
just went over to calm Patrick down I found it quite shocking," he
added.

<HEADLINE> South China Reports Fast Growth in High-Tech Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- High-tech industry has been
expanding rapidly in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, three high-tech industrial zones in
the region's Nanning, Guilin and Liuzhou cities are now home to
well over 2,000 businesses, 215 of which involve high technology.
</P>
<P>
The annual income from trade of technology-based industries in
the three high-tech zones has exceeded seven billion yuan. Local
officials pledged that they would further speed up development of
high-tech industry by constructing an online information network,
spurring growth of bioengineering, new materials, integration of
mechanics and electronics and auto industries, improving the
capacity to transfer high technologies, and creating a pleasant
work environment.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2002, the region hopes that the annual income from
trade of technology-based industries in the three high-tech zones
can rise to 22 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong
Province, has witnessed an annual growth of 20 percent in its high-
tech industrial output value since 1991. Last year, the city's
high-tech industrial output value rocketed to well over 30 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The city now has more than 200 high-tech businesses
specializing in fields such as online information services, bio-
technology, new materials, and optic-electronics integration.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the city government issued a range of policies to
support development of the high-tech industry. These cover the
establishment of a scientific and technological venture investment
company which will provide capital for transfers of high
technologies, and the application of high-technologies in the
industrial process. Another policy ensures that high-tech
achievements can be treated as intangible assets in investment for
high-tech industrial projects.

And Houllier was delighted, and no doubt relieved, to see the
little striker almost back to his best.
</P>
<P>
Owen will lead Liverpool's attack in the Worthington Cup third
round at Southampton, with Houllier agreeing with Keegan's comment
on the teenager's late run-out as substitute: "That's the player I
remember against Argentina."
</P>
<P>
The forward has battled back from a hamstring injury, having
missed all the pre-season training and being forced to regain his
match fitness in the full glare of the Premiership spotlight.
</P>
<P>
But Houllier reckons top-flight defenses for club and country
are about to see the real deal again. "I very much liked what I
saw from Michael in the England game," Houllier said. "I thought
he was getting much more like his real self.
</P>
<P>
"But we expected that. He had only played a few games for us
and when you start a season you need half a dozen friendlies first
before the league matches, and that is what Michael was denied.
</P>
<P>
"Michael had to miss the friendlies and get himself back to
fitness in the real matches, which is much harder."
</P>
<P>
Houllier added: "He's just at the right time now, he has showed
he is not far from his best level. Michael showed in that half an
hour for England far more spark, it was the best I have seen from
him all season.
</P>
<P>
"He is not very far from what he was in the World Cup in 98.
He's quick, pacy, he's clever and can turn quickly to go round
defenders. I very much liked what I saw."

Presidential candidate
</P>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Golkar Party has
decided to retain the presidential nomination of the incumbent
president B.J. Habibie as the party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Ending its two-day executive meeting here Wednesday morning,
Golkar decided to keep Habibie as its presidential hopeful.
</P>
<P>
All participants agreed to nominate Habibie for the presidency,
said Priyo Budi Santo, the party's deputy regional secretary.
</P>
<P>
However, the meeting could not reach a consensus on the party's
vice presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Some participants wanted to pick Defense Minister Gen. Wiranto
as the party's vice presidential nominee, while others wanted to
nominate the party's General Chairman Akbar Tandjung, Coordinating
Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita
or Yogyakarta Governor Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono.
</P>
<P>
The meeting finally decided to recommend Habibie to pick his
running mate, Akbar told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Akbar added that Habibie will hold a meeting with Golkar's
leaders on Wednesday morning to decide the vice presidential
nomination of the party.
</P>
<P>
The presidential election would be held on October 20, while
the vice presidential election is scheduled for October 21.
</P>
<P>
As Golkar presses ahead with his candidacy, Habibie is expected
to race against Megawati Soekarnoputri, chairperson of poll winner
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle and the influential Muslim
leader Abdurrahman Wahid, the founder of the National Awakening
Party.

<HEADLINE> Graham Blasts Norwegians Over Iversen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Tottenham manager George Graham
is on a collision course with the Norwegian FA after an injury to
striker Steffen Iversen.
</P>
<P>
Iversen returned from a Euro 2000 qualifier with a heel injury
that makes him a major doubt for Wednesday night's Worthington Cup
tie against Crewe and Saturday's Premiership visit to Derby.
</P>
<P>
Graham has dismissed reports that Iversen could be out for six
weeks, making Spurs' long-running striker-crisis even worse
following Les Ferdinand's ankle operation last week.
</P>
<P>
But the Spurs boss admitted: "We are very upset with the
Norwegian FA over this and we'll be sending them an official
complaint.
</P>
<P>
"Steffen left us for international duty after our game against
Leicester 10 days ago and was perfectly fit. But we've since
learned he had to have treatment on his heel over in Norway and
was taken off at half-time in their game against Latvia.
</P>
<P>
"They could have at least let us know what was happening out of
common courtesy, but we've heard nothing from them and I believe
there is a bad history with lack of communication between Norway
and the English clubs who supply their players.
</P>
<P>
"We can't do much about it when they have first call on players
for World Cup and Euro 2000 games but it doesn't encourage you to
make them available for international friendly matches when this
kind of thing happens - and we have a few other Norwegians at
Tottenham like Oyvind Leonhardsen and Espen Baardsen."
</P>
<P>
Iversen, Spurs' top scorer with five goals this season, has not
yet been ruled out of Wednesday night's tie in which Spurs start
the defense of the trophy they won at Wembley last season.
</P>
<P>
"He was able to do a little bit of training this morning but
not very much and it is now just a question of seeing how he is
tomorrow," said Graham. "He is certainly not out for a long spell
as has been suggested but the injury has come as a bad surprise to
us.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows we need more strikers at the club and although
I'm prepared to wait for the right quality to become available we
might now have to consider a stop-gap signing, a loan or something
like that," he added.

<HEADLINE> 1000-Year-Old Tibetan Culture Relics Excavated in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, October 13 (Xinhua)-- A group of culture relics of the
Tubo, ancestors of the modern Tibetans, were discovered recently
in east Qaidam Basin in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists from Beijing University have recently excavated
over 30 of the relics, dating back about 1,000 years, in Qinghai
Province's Dulan County, where nearly a thousand ancient tombs
have been found in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The discovery includes pictures of hunting and music and
dancing, three bamboo-slips engraved with Tibetan characters, and
pottery and silk textiles reflecting the Tubo people's unique
cultural traditions, according to Qi Dongfang, an expert in charge
of the excavation.
</P>
<P>
The tomb in which the objects were found has a special
structure, from which "we can learn the hierarchy system of the
society then," he added.
</P>
<P>
Early in the seventh century, Tubo ruler Songtsen Gampo unified
the tribes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and established the Tubo
Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Contacts and exchanges between Tibet and the rest of the China
began in ancient times, particularly after 641 when the Tang
Dynasty (618-907) Emperor Tai Zong, gave Princess Wencheng in
marriage to King Songtsen Gampo, and then conferred on him the
title of "Imperial Son-in-law Governor."
</P>
<P>
When the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368 ) unified all of China in 1279,
Tibet became an administrative region directly under the
administration of the central government.

<HEADLINE> Keegan Welcomes No Seeding System for Euro Play-offs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- England manager Kevin Keegan
said on Tuesday that equality has been achieved with the
announcement that the Euro 2000 play-off draw will not be seeded.
</P>
<P>
UEFA confirmed on Tuesday that England will not have the
apparent luxury of a seeded draw, which could have seen them avoid
sides such as Denmark and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
But Keegan, who will be in the German city of Aachen for the
draw, which could see England drawn against the Republic of
Ireland or Scotland, insists there was no other possible way to
maintain equality in the competition.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted. I think that is the way it should be," Keegan
said. "We are all the same. We have all finished second in our
groups and by rights, we are all in the play-offs.
</P>
<P>
"It is pretty much right. It is a free draw now and if there
are two weaker sides in there - and who is to say what those sides
are -they have got a chance of playing each other and achieving
their dream. This is the way it should be.
</P>
<P>
"Whichever team we come up against will be fighting for their
lives in this tournament just like we are."
</P>
<P>
The eight teams involved in Wednesday's draw are 1992 European
champions Denmark, Slovenia, Turkey, Ukraine, and Israel as well
as England, the Republic of Ireland and Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The first legs will be on November 13 or 14 with the return
fixture on November 17.
</P>
<P>
The four winners will go directly into the Euro 2000 finals and
the draw for that event will be in Brussels on December 12.

<HEADLINE> Power Plant to Run on Garbage in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A new power plant which
generates electricity by "burning garbage" will be built in Xuzhou,
a transportation hub in the northern area of east China's Jiangsu
Province.
</P>
<P>
This plant will be the largest of its kind in the province with
a daily garbage handling capacity of 2,000 tons, and energy output
of 100,000 kilowatts per hour. It will receive a contracted
investment of 80 million U.S. dollars from Radiant Glow Holdings
Co. Ltd. of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The garbage is not "burned" directly at the plant. After
selection and dehydration, the garbage will be cut up and mixed
and converted into combustible gas at a degree of 1,900 centigrade
in a hermetically sealed room without oxygen. Actually, it is
this gas that is burned to generate electricity.
</P>
<P>
The handling process employs a hi-tech innovation developed by
Radiant Glow Holdings, which will run the plant for 20 years
after completion and then hand it over to China.
</P>
<P>
When the plant is completed, the garbage of Xuzhou will be
recycled, saving 110 mu (7.33 hectares) of land and nearly 90,000
tons of standard coal annually.

<P>
KUNMING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan Province, well-know as
the kingdom of animals and plants in southwest China, has spent 3.
2 billion yuan developing biological resources over the past three
and a half years.
</P>
<P>
About one-tenth of the investment came from privately owned
enterprises, an official from the provincial biological resource
development office said.
</P>
<P>
By next year, the province's investment in developing flowers,
vegetables, fruits, wine, potatoes, pharmaceutical products and
other biological resources is expected to reach 4 billion yuan,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan's rich biological resources and relatively low
development costs have attracted many enterprises to investment in
this sector.
</P>
<P>
With only four percent of the country's land area, Yunnan, in
the subtropical zone, has half of the country's plant varieties
and 55 percent of its wild animal species.
</P>
<P>
After 40 years of development, Yunnan's output of rubber, tea,
sugarcane and flue-cured tobacco is now among the first ranking in
China.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 59 projects related to biological resources achieved
over 100 million yuan in profit, and industrial and agricultural
output value related to biological resources reached 4.4 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceutical enterprises in the Kunming Hi-tech Development
Zone alone realized 2 billion yuan in output value last year,
accounting for 60 percent of the zone's total.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Army Chief General
Pervaiz Musharraf addressed the nation on the early morning of
Wednesday after a successful coup attempt which dismissed the
government led by Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf said the armed forces "have moved in as a
last resort to prevent any further destalilization".
</P>
<P>
"My singular concern has been the well being of our country
alone," he
said, "This has been the sole reason that the army willingly
offered its
services for nation building tasks, the results of which have
already
been judged by you."
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said the country under the rule of Sharif government
have
witnessed all kinds of turmoil and uncertainty in recent times.
"Not only
have all the institutions have been played around with, and
systematically destroyed, the economy too is in a state of
collapse."
</P>
<P>
"We are also aware of the self-serving policies being followed,
which
have rocked the very foundation of the Federation of Pakistan,"
the
general said.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Sharif government had tried to interfere with
the armed
forces and tried to "politicize the army, destabilize it and tried
to
create dissension within its ranks".
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said the commercial flight that he was on board from
a visit
to Sri Lanka was ordered to be diverted to anywhere outside
Pakistan
"despite acute shortage of fuel, imperiling the life of all the
passengers".
</P>
<P>
"Thanks be to Allah, this evil design was thwarted through
speedy army
action," he said.
</P>
<P>
The general, sacked hours before his return from Sri Lanka by
Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif, said he has taken the coup with "all
sincerity,
loyalty and selfless devotion to the country" with the armed
forces
"firmly behind" him.
</P>
<P>
He assured the people that the situation in the country is
"perfectly
calm, stable and under control".
</P>
<P>
Concluding his ten-minute speech which was screened on Pakistan

Television and aired by Radio Pakistan, Musharraf promised to
preserve
the integrity and sovereignty of the country. "Your armed forces
have
never and shall never let you down," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called the people to remain calm and support the armed
forces "in
the re-establishment of order to pave the way for a prosperous
future for
Pakistan".
</P>
<P>
Musharraf's address came some six hours after the army house
arrested
the prime minister and other senior governmental officials and
controlled
Pakistan Television (PTV) and Radio Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The general didn't make a policy statement but promised to do
so
briefly.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf dashed, immediately after he arrived at the Karachi
international airport, to the federal capital Islamabad, where he
presided over a high-level army meeting, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
PTV announced at some 22:00 Tuesday local time (1700 GMT) that
the
Sharif government had been dismissed and General Musharraf would
address
the nation.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move, earlier Tuesday Sharif removed Musharraf
from the
posts of Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (JCSC) and
Chief of
Army Staff (COAS) and appointed Lt. General Ziauddin as the new
army
chief.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Abdullah Meet on Middle East Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Jordan's King Abdullah Tuesday held talks on the Middle East
issues, including sanctions on Iraq and the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah had signaled before coming to Washington that he would
deliver a message from Iraq to Clinton. But White House aides said
Abdullah did not give the message to Clinton during their
45-minute Oval Office meeting, nor did he give one to Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
White House National Security Council spokesman David Leavy
said the sanctions against Iraq cannot be lifted until Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein has complied with all U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"There's a clear sentiment that Saddam has to comply with his
obligations under the Security Council resolutions and that he
needs to fulfill his responsibilities, and both leaders (Clinton
and Abdullah) made clear this is important to move forward on
dealing with Iraq," Leavy told reporters.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said Albright made it
clear to Abdullah during their meeting that "Saddam Hussein must
comply with all U.N. Security Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Abdullah also discussed the Middle East peace
process, including the delays in talks toward a permanent peace
deal between Israel and the Palestinians, and the absence of a
direct dialogue between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Leavy said they discussed "the need to keep moving forward and
the need for a comprehensive peace in the Middle East and what are
the next steps."
</P>
<P>
Clinton told Abdullah he would continue pressing the
Republican-led Congress for approval of 100 million dollars in
economic aid to Jordan promised during last year's Wye
land-for-security deal.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Customer Relations Management Market to Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The convergence of
e-commerce with existing supply-chain channels is forcing
companies to find better ways to serve customers, according to
reports from two U.S. market research firms.
</P>
<P>
International Data Corporation (IDC) said Tuesday that
companies all around the globe are quickly realizing that
effective customer relationship management (CRM) can be a key
competitive differentiator and are eagerly writing checks to
procure CRM services.
</P>
<P>
IDC estimates worldwide CRM services revenues, including
consulting, systems integration and outsourcing, will exceed 40
billion U.S. dollars in 1999, and by 2003, revenues will approach
90 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to another research firm, AMR Research Inc, the U.S.
CRM market is expected to witness 60 percent revenue growth this
year, with compound annual growth of 49 percent by 2003. Revenues
will climb from 2.3 billion dollars in 1998 to 16.3 billion
dollars by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Companies are using CRM applications to enhance their
competitive position and boost revenue by identifying and
maintaining customers, integrating with back-end ERP (enterprise
resource planning) systems to create a single customer contact
point and more efficiently managing business coming in via the
Web, the AMR report said.
</P>
<P>
"Companies are now developing business plans with CRM
strategies earmarked as the key to revenue-enhancement
opportunities and custom retention," said the AMR report. "CRM
applications, along with e-commerce systems, address these
critical issues and are becoming the hub of many companies'
marketing strategies."

<HEADLINE> Profile of Former Pak Prime Minister Sharif </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The following is the profile
of Nawaz Sharif who was dismissed from his office as Pakistan's
prime minister Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif was born on December 25, 1949. He comes from a
business background and is a law graduate from Pakistan's oldest
seat of learning, the Punjab University.
</P>
<P>
Sharif was inducted into the world of politics in 1981 at the
age of 32, when he was appointed finance minister of Punjab,
Pakistan's most populous province.
</P>
<P>
At the age of 35, Sharif became the youngest chief minister of
Punjab province. He was reelected to this position in 1988.
</P>
<P>
It was in 1990 that Sharif emerged on the national scene
heading a grouping of nine parties under the banner of the Islamic
Democratic Alliance which won a decisive majority in the October
1990 elections.
</P>
<P>
In November 1990, Sharif became Pakistan's prime minister, the
tenure lasted for 30 months. He was marked by an accent on opening
up the economy, energizing the entrepreneurial skills of the
people and working as a "bridge builder" among Pakistan's four
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Sharif's government was first dismissed by former president
Ghulam Ishaq Khan on April 18, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Sharif was elected chairman of the Pakistan Muslim League in
April 1993, and became prime minister in February 1997 after an
overwhelming victory in the general elections.

<HEADLINE> Sharif Rules Pakistan for 31 Months During 2nd Tenure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The government of Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif was dismissed after two years, seven months
and 25 days in office during its second tenure.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif came into power for the second time when he took
oath on February 17, 1997 as Pakistan's top executive following
the general elections in the same month.
</P>
<P>
Sharif first assumed his premiership in November 1990 when the
then president Ghulam Ishaq Khan announced fresh polls after the
dismissal of the Pakistan People's Party-led government by using
his constitutional powers under the eighth amendment of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
However, even during his first tenure, Nawaz Sharif could not
complete three years in the office.
</P>
<P>
According to Pakistan's Constitution, the tenure of an elected
government is five years. However, since the inception of Pakistan
in 1947, not a single government has completed the five-year term.

<HEADLINE> Perry Recommends Co-Existence Between U.S., DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Defense
Secretary William Perry recommended Tuesday that the United States
and its Asian allies try to co-exist with the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
He told a Senate panel that the United States should gradually
eliminate sanctions and reduce pressures on the DPRK in exchange
for assurances that Pyongyang will not have a nuclear weapons
program and will not test, deploy, produce or export long-range
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Perry, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton last year to
coordinate the U.S. policy toward the DPRK, had spent 10 months
reviewing the policy and submitted a report to the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
An unclassified version of the report was released Tuesday by
the State Department. In the report, Perry recommended:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States should seek complete and verifiable
assurances that the DPRK does not have a nuclear weapons program
and the complete and verifiable cessation of testing, production,
deployment and export of long-range missiles;
</P>
<P>
-- Step by step the United States would ease off on the DPRK;
</P>
<P>
-- The United States would normalize relations with Pyongyang
and relax trade sanctions;
</P>
<P>
-- The United States would aim to preserve the Agreed
Framework, the 1994 agreement in which the DPRK froze its nuclear
program in exchange for supplies of fuel oil and the promise of
two light-water nuclear power plants;
</P>
<P>
-- The United States should continue to act in concert with the
governments of South Korea and Japan in its dealing with the DPRK.
Perry had consulted South Korea and Japan before writing the
report.
</P>
<P>
Perry said in the report that the United States would "take
other steps to assure their security and contain the threat" to
the DPRK, if Pyongyang rejects the U.S. proposals.
</P>
<P>
But Washington should avoid a direct conflict, which Perry said
would probably leave hundreds of thousands of people dead,
military and civilians on both sides, and millions of refugees.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell
sharply Tuesday as investors rushed into the lower bond market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 231.12 at
10,417.06. It was the blue chips's largest point drop since the
index lost 235.23 points on May 27.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 22.17 at 1,313.04 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 43.52 at 2,872.43, retreating from the
record closing high of 2,915.95 set Monday.
</P>
<P>
Stocks plunged as bond investors sold in fear of higher
interests ahead of the government reports on wholesale prices and
industrial production this week. The lower bond prices pushed the
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond up to 6.22 percent from 6.20
percent Friday, making bonds more attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
While leaving the interest rates alone on October 5, the
Federal Reserve warned that it would raise the rates if demands or
prices put more pressures on inflation.
</P>
<P>
The weak dollar also helped to drag the stocks lower. The
dollar dropped to 106.22 against the Japanese yen Tuesday from
106.68 Monday.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 9.95 at 603.38 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies fell 5.51 at 424.68. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 2.09 at 792.11.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,175 down, 866 up and 508
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 769.10 million shares from 653.76
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Canada Declares Throne Speech for New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Newly installed Canadian
Governor General Adrienne Clarkson delivered her first throne
speech here Tuesday, calling for a strong and united country into
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "the Millennium Agenda" by the local media, the speech
"requires national will, national strategies and partnerships
across the country" to "collectively build an even stronger and
more united Canada."
</P>
<P>
The speech represents the policy to be taken by the Liberal
government for its second half of the four-year term of office,
which expires in the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien has recently repeated his
readiness for his third-term election on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
The speech, interpreted by the local media as the beginning
leading to the 2001 election, promises less tax burden and more
social spending.
</P>
<P>
It also pledged tightened legislative measures for resources
and environmental control while increasing investments in research
and education to boost innovative, knowledge-based industries.
</P>
<P>
Unlike speculations, the 24-page throne speech does not give
any details on how to spend the budgetary surplus of about 10
billion Canadian dollars (about 6.8 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin is expected to deliver a
public assessment in early November.

<P>
Musharraf's address came some six hours after the army house
arrested the prime minister and other senior governmental
officials and controlled Pakistan Television (PTV) and Radio
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The general didn't make a policy statement but promised to do
so briefly.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf dashed, immediately after he arrived at the Karachi
international airport, to the federal capital Islamabad, where he
presided over a high-level army meeting, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
PTV announced at some 22:00 Tuesday local time (1700 GMT) that
the Sharif government had been dismissed and General Musharraf
would address the nation.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move, earlier Tuesday Sharif removed Musharraf
from the posts of Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee
(JCSC) and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) and appointed Lt. General
Ziauddin as the new army chief.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell
sharply Tuesday as investors rushed into the lower bond market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 231.12 at
10,417.06. It was the blue chips's largest point drop since the
index lost 235.23 points on May 27.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 22.17 at 1,313.04 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 43.52 at 2,872.43, retreating from the
record closing high of 2,915.95 set Monday.
</P>
<P>
Stocks plunged as bond investors sold in fear of higher
interests ahead of the government reports on wholesale prices and
industrial production this week. The lower bond prices pushed the
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond up to 6.22 percent from 6.20
percent Friday, making bonds more attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
While leaving the interest rates alone on October 5, the
Federal Reserve warned that it would raise the rates if demands or
prices put more pressures on inflation.
</P>
<P>
The weak dollar also helped to drag the stocks lower. The
dollar dropped to 106.22 against the Japanese yen Tuesday from
106.68 Monday.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 9.95 at 603.38 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies fell 5.51 at 424.68. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 2.09 at 792.11.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,175 down, 866 up and 508
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 769.10 million shares from 653.76
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Canada Declares Throne Speech for New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Newly installed Canadian
Governor General Adrienne Clarkson delivered her first throne
speech here Tuesday, calling for a strong and united country into
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "the Millennium Agenda" by the local media, the speech
"requires national will, national strategies and partnerships
across the country" to "collectively build an even stronger and
more united Canada."
</P>
<P>
The speech represents the policy to be taken by the Liberal
government for its second half of the four-year term of office,
which expires in the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien has recently repeated his
readiness for his third-term election on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
The speech, interpreted by the local media as the beginning
leading to the 2001 election, promises less tax burden and more
social spending.
</P>
<P>
It also pledged tightened legislative measures for resources
and environmental control while increasing investments in research
and education to boost innovative, knowledge-based industries.
</P>
<P>
Unlike speculations, the 24-page throne speech does not give
any details on how to spend the budgetary surplus of about 10
billion Canadian dollars (about 6.8 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin is expected to deliver a
public assessment in early November.

"My singular concern has been the well being of our country
alone," he said, "This has been the sole reason that the army
willingly offered its services for nation building tasks, the
results of which have already been judged by you."
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said the country under the rule of Sharif government
have witnessed all kinds of turmoil and uncertainty in recent
times. "Not only have all the institutions have been played around
with, and systematically destroyed, the economy too is in a state
of collapse."
</P>
<P>
"We are also aware of the self-serving policies being followed,
which have rocked the very foundation of the Federation of
Pakistan," the general said.

He accused the Sharif government had tried to interfere with
the armed forces and tried to "politicize the army, destabilize it
and tried to create dissension within its ranks".
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said the commercial flight that he was on board from
a visit to Sri Lanka was ordered to be diverted to anywhere
outside Pakistan "despite acute shortage of fuel, imperiling the
life of all the passengers".
</P>
<P>
"Thanks be to Allah, this evil design was thwarted through
speedy army action," he said.
</P>
<P>
The general, sacked hours before his return from Sri Lanka by
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, said he has taken the coup with "all
sincerity, loyalty and selfless devotion to the country" with the
armed forces "firmly behind" him.
</P>
<P>
He assured the people that the situation in the country is
"perfectly calm, stable and under control".
</P>
<P>
Concluding his ten-minute speech which was screened on Pakistan
Television and aired by Radio Pakistan, Musharraf promised to
preserve the integrity and sovereignty of the country. "Your armed
forces have never and shall never let you down," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called the people to remain calm and support the armed
forces "in the re-establishment of order to pave the way for a
prosperous future for Pakistan".
