	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ In one of the
deadliest clashes since the early days of the Zapatista uprising,
nine people were killed when the Army tried to retake control of a
town sympathetic to the rebels in the southern state of Chiapas.
Fifty-two people were arrested.
	   At least six of the victims in Wednesday's clash were believed
to be Zapatista rebels and one was a police officer. Gov. Roberto
Albores Guillen announced late Wednesday that two more people had
died, but didn't specify whether they were rebels or from the
security forces.
	   Earlier, the government had announced that nine people were
wounded, including seven police officers. One officer was wounded
when a police helicopter was fired on and forced to land.

Trouble piling up for ailing Greek conservatives

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Costas Caramanlis was supposed to be the
Bill Clinton or Tony Blair of Greece's ailing conservative New
Democracy party.
	   When the political scion was elected party leader last year, he
promised to rejuvenate the party that led Greece out of a military
junta in 1974 but has spent 14 of the last 17 years in opposition.
	   Instead, the 41-year-old Caramanlis has tripped up in a series
of blunders that have alienated long-term supporters and derailed
any immediate hopes of challenging the powerful Socialists.
	   The feeble opposition has enabled the Socialist government to
ram through unpopular economic austerity plans designed to raise
the country to European Union fiscal standards. Labor groups have
denounced Premier Costas Simitis, but New Democracy has been unable
to capitalize on the grumbling in perhaps its best opportunity in
years to expand its grassroots support.
	   And after 14 years of Socialist rule, there is widespread worry
that the governing party could become too entrenched or corrupt.
	   To challenge the generally stodgy Socialist leadership,
Caramanlis followed the lead of other young Western leaders and
tried to a project a dynamic image. He invited reporters to watch
him work out and participate in weekly pick-up soccer matches.
	   But that ended in embarrassment in March. Caramanlis
aggressively lunged for the ball, tripped and broke his leg.
	   Also much discussed is his tendency to walk a few meters (yards)
in front of his fiance. He is universally known as ``Costakis,'' or
``Little Costas,'' to distinguish him from his late uncle and
namesake, the highly respected conservative party founder.
	   Caramanlis' uncle, Constantine, founded New Democracy in 1974
and was regarded as the elder statesman of Greek politics until his
death this April.
	   The younger Caramanlis has served in parliament for nine years,
but had never held a cabinet or serious leadership position until
taking the helm of New Democracy.
	   ``I don't think he was ready,'' said political science professor
Constantine Arvanitopoulos. ``He hadn't really prepared himself for
the party leadership.''
	   A mourner outside the senior Caramanlis' funeral put it more
bluntly. As Caramanlis walked toward the church, the onlooker
shouted: ``Too bad you're not like your uncle!''
	   Caramanlis' problems also reflect a Europe-wide blurring of
political agendas. As politicians reach consensus over liberalizing
markets and streamlining bloated economies, right and left parties
have sometimes grown indistinguishable.
	   In Greece, much like in Blair's Britain, the Socialists have
adopted the pro-market economic platform long advocated by the
right.
	   In a recent stump campaign across Greece, Caramanlis spent much
of his time attacking what his party calls ``the wasted years'' of
Socialist rule.
	   ``We can do better,'' he said in a speech long on heated
rhetoric but short on specifics. ``Our goal isn't to govern, but to
govern well.''
	   But Caramanlis himself is beset by challengers within.
	   Former conservative Premier Constantine Mitsotakis has broken
with the party leader. Six influential members of the party were
expelled in March for refusing to toe the line in a vote on
privatization, and now are making rumbles about founding a new
party.
	   Above it all looms Athens Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos, a suave
and popular conservative seen as the most likely challenger for
party leadership.
	   The conservative party's near-dissolution has even led members
of the governing Socialist party, including Simitis, to express
concern for the future of the two-party system in Greece.
	   ``Democracy walks on two legs _ government and opposition,''
said Michalis Papaconstantinou, who served as foreign minister in
the New Democracy government from 1990-93 but was later expelled
from the party.
	   ``Here there is government but no opposition. If the government
fails, what will take its place? Chaos?''
	   Recently, New Democracy leadership had called for all its
parliament members to ride bicycles to work to mark world
environment day. A front-page cartoon in Athens daily Ta Nea showed
Caramanlis and key party members on a long tandem bike.
	   But the bicycle chain was off the sprocket and the handlebars
all faced different directions.

Wacoal founder Tsukamoto dies of pneumonia at 77
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Koichi Tsukamoto, a pioneer in Japan's undergarment
industry, died of pneumonia at a hospital in Kyoto, a spokesman for
Wacoal Corp. said. He was 77.
	   Tsukamoto had served as chairman of Wacoal since 1987, when his
son, Yoshikata, became president of the company, Japan's largest
women's undergarment manufacturer.
	   Tsukamoto was best known for his efforts to promote
Western-style dress in Japan after World War II. In addition to
developing a top-selling bra suitable for Japanese body frames, he
gained notoriety for staging the first women's undergarment fashion
show in Japan.
	   The show was held at a department store in the western Japanese
city of Osaka in 1952. It was closed to men.
	   A private funeral will be held at a Buddhist temple in Kyoto,
where Wacoal is based, on June 14. Tsukamoto is survived by his
wife, Yoshie, two daughters and his son.

Bulls 86, Jazz 82
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The Chicago Bulls moved closer to their sixth NBA
title this decade with an 86-82 victory over the Utah Jazz
Wednesday night in Game 4 of the NBA Finals.
	   Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen scored almost 75 percent of
their team's points, Dennis Rodman showed enough nerve to make two
crucial free throws and the Bulls played another 48 minutes of
suffocating defense.
	   The win gave the Bulls a 3-1 lead and a chance to win the title
on their home floor for the third straight year when the series
resumes Friday night.
	   Jordan finished with 34 points, Pippen had 28 and Rodman grabbed
14 rebounds in his best game of the series.
	   The Jazz were again hurt by the disappearance of Karl Malone in
the fourth quarter. In his third poor game of the series, the
Mailman didn't score in the fourth until nine seconds remained _
way too late for the Jazz.
	   Utah actually lost this one over the final three minutes.
	   After showing some life when it looked like they were dead by
coming back from a seven-point deficit and tying the game, the Jazz
couldn't sustain the run and make the big plays when they most
mattered.
	   Just like in Game 2, the Jazz allowed Chicago to grab nearly
every important offensive rebound, including seven by Rodman and
five by Pippen.
	   Jordan had two late spin moves on Shandon Anderson. The first
gave the Bulls the lead for good; the second gave Chicago a
three-point lead with 1:38 left.
	   Jordan shot an airball with 48 seconds left, but Malone was
called for a loose ball foul when he got tangled with Rodman. The
Worm calmly sank both shots, making it 81-77 with 43.8 seconds
left, and Utah couldn't recover.
	   John Stockton drove for a reverse layup and missed, and the ball
was batted around by four players until Ron Harper grabbed it. Toni
Kukoc was fouled and made both shots with 26.6 second left, upping
the lead to six.
	   That was pretty much the end for Utah, which now faces a nearly
impossible task.
	   Only six teams in NBA history have come back from 3-1 deficits
in the playoffs, although it has never happened in the finals.
	   And the Jazz will have to find a way to win on Chicago's home
court, where the Bulls haven't lost in the finals since 1993.
	   The Bulls, whose home winning streak reached seven games, have
won their last 26 playoff series when they led after three games.
	   Other than Jordan and Pippen, no one else reached double figures
for Chicago. Toni Kukoc had eight points and Harper and Rodman had
six each.
	   The Jazz, unable to run their offense smoothly because of
Chicago's size and tenacity on defense, shot only 42 percent and
also had just two players reach double figures.
	   Malone was Utah's leading scorer with 21 points, and Bryon
Russell reached 10 by making a meaningless 3-pointer at the final
buzzer.
	   Stockton shot 3-for-11 and Jeff Hornacek was 3-for-8.
	   The Jazz didn't reach 54 points _ their infamous total from
Sunday night's record-setting loss _ until Howard Eisley made a
free throw with 38.4 seconds left in the third.
	   Eisley's second free throw pulled Utah to 58-55, but Pippen
responded with a 3-pointer _ his fifth of the night _ to help give
the Bulls a 61-57 lead entering the fourth.
	   A pair of foul shots by Luc Longley gave the Bulls another
seven-point lead early in the fourth. But the Jazz came back, and
Stockton fed Chris Morris for a fast break layup with five minutes
left that gave the Jazz their first lead since the first quarter,
70-69.
	   However, the Jazz faltered down the stretch. Morris missed a 3
and Hornacek committed a loose ball foul, leading to a free throw
by Pippen that made it 79-75 with 1:21 left.
	   Hornacek's corner jumper with his foot on 3-point line with 1:05
left made it a two-point game again, but that was as close as Utah
would get.
	   Pippen made three 3-pointers in the first quarter when he and
Jordan combined to score 19 of Chicago's 21 points. Malone had 11
for the Jazz, who trailed 21-19 at the end of the quarter.
	   Jordan scored six more points in the second quarter, including a
finger-roll layup at the buzzer that gave Chicago a 39-37 halftime
lead.

Australian casino drops plan to sue Malaysian lawmaker: report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An Australian casino has dropped
plans to sue a Malaysian lawmaker after he agreed to settle a
gambling debt of 4.8 million Malaysian ringgit (dlrs 1.2 million)
in installments, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Private investigators representing the casino in Perth said that
the member of parliament had paid up the first installment on
Wednesday, the New Straits Times reported.
	   ``We have got no further interest in the MP's case as he has
promised to pay the amount in due course,'' said Christopher White,
a private investigator working on behalf of the casino.
	   Lawsuits would, however, be filed against six other Malaysians
who owed the casino 2.4 million ringgit (dlrs 615,000), he said.
	   The debts were all incurred since 1994.
	   More than 100 Malaysian gamblers ran up debts totaling 60
million ringgit (dlrs 15 million) over the last four years in 10
casinos in Australia, a popular destination for rich Malaysians,
dailies had reported earlier.
	   In 1995, a Las Vegas casino sued a Malaysian businessman to
recover a dlrs 1.3 million gambling debt.

	   In Chicago, Robin Ventura hit a tying home run with two outs in
the ninth inning, then hit a game-winning, two-run shot in the 11th
for Chicago.
	   Mark McGwire hit his major league-leading 30th homer in helping
St. Louis take a 7-0 lead. Albert Belle hit a pair of three-run
homers for the White Sox, tying his career high with six RBIs.

who had 15 hits off four Anaheim pitchers.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian police Thursday released
an opposition member of Parliament four hours after detaining him
for speaking at a political rally banned by authorities.
	   Lim Guan Eng, deputy secretary-general of the Democratic Action
Party, was taken to the Petaling Jaya police station at about 10.30
p.m. (1330 GMT) Wednesday shortly after he spoke to 2,000
supporters.
	   Three party members detained along with Lim were released with
him about four hours later early Thursday. Lim's three colleagues
had apparently tussled with policemen who were carting away
amplifiers and speakers used at the political rally. Police
dispersed the crowd shortly after midnight.
	   The four suffered minor cuts and bruises, Lim said.
	   ``We are not criminals,'' he told a news conference Thursday.
``There is no need to use force. If the police want to arrest us we
will allow ourselves to be arrested.''
	   Although police recorded their statements, no charges had been
pressed yet, he said. The four were allowed to leave the police
station after they refused to post bail or sign personal bonds, Lim
said.
	   A police spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
But police have said earlier that these meetings could jeopardize
public peace and security.
	   ``The police were the ones who initiated the breach of peace.
They were the threat and not the DAP,'' Lim said.
	   This is the fourth time police have shut down public meetings
over the past 10 days and the third time police have disbanded
opposition gatherings.
	   The DAP said they would go ahead with similar meetings every
day, irrespective of the ban.
	   ``With the government bent on establishing a police state, this
is the end of the freedom of expression in Malaysia,'' Lim said
Thursday night in a telephone interview from the police station.
	   Dozens of organizations have decried the crackdown as an assault
on civil liberties and free speech.
	   At Wednesday's fund-raising dinner for Lim _ who has been
sentenced to 18 months in prison for printing a pamphlet that
questioned Malaysia's political system _ police in riot gear had
stood watch. A required police permit for the gathering had been
denied.
	   A number of DAP leaders spoke during the dinner. Vehicles
clogged the road adjoining the field, where more than 60 dinner
tables had been placed for their supporters.
	   As the night continued, hundreds of people from the surrounding
neighborhoods also gathered to watch the spectacle. Shortly after
Lim began to speak, dozens of police in riot gear moved in to nab
him.
	   ``Malaysia is lurching toward a police state,'' said Lim's
father, party secretary-general Lim Kit Siang and the opposition
leader in Parliament.
	   ``In Indonesia, the people who have been muzzled for three
decades are beginning to experience a new freedom of expression,''
said Lim Sr., as his son was led away. ``But in Malaysia, the
government has suddenly become afraid of the voice of the people.''

Death toll in cyclone rises to 559, mass cremation of unclaimed

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Rescue workers, their faces covered with
handkerchiefs, lit the pyre at a mass cremation Thursday for more
than 100 victims of a cyclone that killed at least 559 people and
devastated India's western coast.
	   Most of the deaths _ 550 _ were in Gujarat state, where the
cyclone first hit land Tuesday. Gujarat's Kutch district was the
worst hit, with 423 deaths. Most of the victims were poor salt
workers who did not heed government warnings to leave their homes
before the cyclone hit.
	   The cyclone, with winds up to 100 kph (65 mph) when it first
hit, had weakened by the time it moved north later Tuesday, but
still killed nine people in neighboring Rajasthan state.
	   Soldiers distributed food for the second consecutive day in
relief camps set up for thousands of people left homeless. The
Times of India newspaper reported that prices of essential
commodities had shot up because of the scarcity.
	   Pravin Lehri, a top government official in the Gujarati capital
of Gandhinagar, 465 kilometers (290 miles) north of Bombay, said by
telephone that the mass cremation was held because bodies were
deteriorating quickly.
	   ``We could not wait for relatives ... so we photographed the
bodies for identification later,'' he said, adding that most of the
victimes were found scattered around salt pans.
	   The bodies of more than 300 salt workers were recovered after
they were swept into the Arabian Sea or drowned by a 12-foot
(four-meter) tidal wave that lashed villages near the port of
Kandla, 530 kilometers (330 miles) northwest of Bombay.
	   The workers earn their living by erecting sand walls to trap sea
water, and collecting salt for sale after the water evaporates.
	   Newspapers said 50,000 people fled their homes when a gas tank
in Kandla sprung a leak Wednesday. The leak was later plugged.
	   Other deaths in Gujarat were caused by lightning, wall collapses
or drowning. At least six entire coastal villages in the area were
swept away.
	   Port equipment worth 200 million rupees (dlrs 4.7 million) was
destroyed. The estimates of total property loss in Gujarat are
estimated at 12 billion rupees (dlrs 284 million).
	   Two years ago, an even more devastating cyclone, with wind
speeds of more than 160 kph (100 mph), hit India's southeastern
Andhra Pradesh state. More than 1,000 people were killed, and crop
and property losses were staggering.

Philippine Airlines flight attendants, ground crew may join strike

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Flight attendants and ground crew of
troubled Philippine Airlines threatened Thursday to join a strike
by about 600 pilots if the company institutes layoffs in a move to
cut costs.
	   ``We are going all the way with the pilots,'' said Roberto
Anduiza, president of the 2,100-strong Flight Attendants and
Stewardesses Association of the Philippines.
	   Anduiza said some members of the union would join the striking
pilots in a picket line later Thursday.
	   Gerry Rivera, vice president of the PAL Employees Association,
which represents ground crew and sales personnel, said members of
his union will also join the picket in a ``show of support,'' short
of an actual strike.
	   Rivera said they will declare their own strike if the company
attempts to reduce the work force or slash salaries.
	   On Wednesday, the financially beleaguered airline announced it
will no longer accept back the striking pilots and will sharply
reduce its operations to match the few pilots it still has.
	   It earlier announced plans to sharply reduce staff, slash costs
and cut flights to survive its long-term financial problems.
	   It also said it will sell some of its 54 aircraft, including
some recently purchased.
	   In a statement Thursday, it said it will resume regular but
limited flight operations.
	   The airline said it will serve 14 domestic points along with
regular flights to Narita, Singapore, Hong Kong and San Francisco
beginning Friday.
	   Before the 620-strong Airline Pilots Association of the
Philippines went on strike last Friday, the airline flew 160 daily
domestic flights to 39 points and served 30 cities in 17 countries.
	   The pilots are protesting a management policy of ordering pilots
to retire who have reached 20 years of service or flown 20,000
hours, regardless of age. The policy puts about 200 pilots in
danger of forced retirement, the union said.
	   PAL, however, said it was not a unilateral management policy but
a provision in a collective bargaining agreement signed by airline
and union officials.
	   PAL said the strike has cost it about 150 million pesos (dlrs
3.8 million) a day in lost revenue. It said it lost 8 billion pesos
(dlrs 205 million) in the last fiscal year _ three times more than
the previous year.
	   Sotico Lloren, president of the pilots' union, said they have
offered to return to work on condition that there will be no
retaliatory actions against strikers and the airline pledges in
writing to suspend the retirement plan until a court has ruled on
the issue or a new agreement with the union is reached.
	   A PAL representative rejected the offer Wednesday and said the
airline considered all strikers terminated since they failed to
comply with a government back-to-work order on Tuesday.

Wacoal founder Tsukamoto dies of pneumonia at 77

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Koichi Tsukamoto, a pioneer in Japan's undergarment
industry, died of pneumonia at a hospital in Kyoto, a spokesman for
Wacoal Corp. said Thursday. He was 77.
	   Tsukamoto, who died Wednesday, had served as chairman of Wacoal
since 1987, when his son, Yoshikata, became president of the
company, Japan's largest women's undergarment manufacturer.
	   Tsukamoto was best known for his efforts to promote
Western-style dress in Japan after World War II. In addition to
developing a top-selling bra suitable for Japanese body frames, he
gained notoriety for staging the first women's undergarment fashion
show in Japan.
	   The show was held at a department store in the western Japanese
city of Osaka in 1952. It was closed to men.
	   A private funeral will be held at a Buddhist temple in Kyoto,
where Wacoal is based, on June 14. Tsukamoto is survived by his
wife, Yoshie, two daughters and his son.

Philippine stocks, peso fall sharply on weak yen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks and the peso
plunged Thursday on concerns over the continued weakening of the
Japanese yen and other Asian currencies, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index dropped 88.85
points, or 4.6 percent, to 1,829.02, its lowest level since
January, according to preliminary data.
	   The index fell 6.62 points, or 0.3 percent, on Wednesday and has
now lost 128.74 points over the past four sessions.
	   ``The region's problems are now taking their toll on us. We've
long pretended to be stronger than the rest, so now we're just
catching up with the rest of the region's losses,'' said Ian Kane,
trader for Anscor-Hagedorn Securities Inc.
	   Blue-chip stocks suffered the biggest losses Thursday. Among
them, Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. fell nearly 2 percent
and power distributor Manila Electric Co.'s B shares fell 4.4
percent.
	   The recent weakening of the yen has intensified fears the region
may be in for another round of currency devaluations.
	   The peso extended its recent losses in morning trading,
averaging 40.338 pesos per dollar at midday compared to 39.775
pesos on Wednesday. It touched a morning high of 40.470 pesos.
	   The absence of yen-supportive comments at a meeting of finance
officials from the Group of Seven industrialized nations, which
closed in Paris on Wednesday, also pressured regional currencies.
	   A further weakening of major Asian currencies in the near term
could raise the value of the dollar to as high as 45 pesos by the
end of June, Kane said.
	   He said the yen's decline could also further undermine Asian
economies.
	   ``Historically, Asian economies have tracked the strength of the
yen,'' he said.
	   Fears of a possible devaluation of China's yuan and the Hong
Kong dollar have also led to more selldowns in regional stock
markets, he said.
	   Joy Quintos, research head of Capital One Securities Inc., said
the Philippine stock market may continue to weaken unless the
volatility of regional currencies eases.
	   ``We will be looking at regional currencies for direction,'' she
said.
	   Markets will be closed Friday for a national holiday to
celebrate the centennial of the Philippines' declaration of
independence from Spanish colonial rule.

Workers look for new skills as Hong Kong slides into recession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Until recently, finding a job in Hong Kong was
easy. While much of Asia sank into crisis, the stock market was
thriving and exports were up. Unemployment hovered around 2
percent.
	   But the region's problems now are pulling Hong Kong into
recession, too. Retail sales dropped, tourism dwindled, and
construction slowed. Even the high-flying financial sector is
hurting.
	   Joblessness now stands at 3.9 percent, still low by many
standards but a 14-year high for Hong Kong. Legislators are
clamoring for action. On Friday, the largest party, the Democrats,
called on the government to abandon its insistence on budget
surpluses and contemplate deficit spending to boost the economy.
	   Officials say there is relatively little they can do, and that
they are attacking one of the biggest problems _ a mismatch of
skills for lower-income workers.
	   Cut loose by his employer of 10 years, chauffeur Ricky Tong is
now learning to use a computer at a government-funded training
center. So is Peggy Wong, who left her retail job when her wages
got cut. She and her husband now depend only on his salary as a
cook in a Vietnamese restaurant.
	   ``The main reason why unemployed workers can't find a job is
they are lagging behind the market,'' said the center's executive
director, Chow Tung-shan. ``One of our major tasks is
de-training.''
	   The training is not a ticket to riches, but might lead to a job.
	   Tong, 33, drove a nice car for a wealthy businessman, ate well,
and had enough money left over to spend on his weekends.
	   But two months ago, his boss decided that he could get more for
the 10,500 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 1,350) a month he was
paying Tong.
	   ``I'm willing to do anything now,'' Tong said. ``But employers
are hiring for lower salaries expecting you to do everything _ no
complaints.''
	   The government lists some 43,000 job vacancies for more than
100,000 unemployed. Officials announced plans this week to create
another 100,000 jobs in the next 18 months.
	   The plans include little new money. Instead, they move up the
schedule for infrastructure projects, which will provide temporary
construction jobs, as well as improving education and employment
retraining, and expanding some welfare services.
	   ``It will not be an easy ride,'' said Deputy Education Secretary
Matthew Cheung. ``But with a much better educated workforce like
ours, we can turn the tables.''
	   Critics say the government hasn't done enough. Unions claim the
actual number of unemployed is much higher, and say the government
should spend more to create jobs and improve social services.
	   Seven major political parties came up with their own program,
including cutting public transportation charges and government
fees, and providing assistance to smaller businesses that form the
backbone of the economy.
	   Despite its affluence, Hong Kong provides little help to the
unemployed.
	   Unless they have less than 37,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
4,800) in cash and assets, they get nothing. During the first
quarter of the year, about one-tenth of Hong Kong's 195,000 welfare
recipients were unemployed workers, and they got an average of
1,800 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 234) a month.
	   Tong is using up his meager savings paying his share of a
600-square-foot (55-square- meter) apartment, which he shares with
five others.
	   ``I'm running out of money,'' he said. ``I can't run to my
family and friends. It doesn't look good.''
	   Hoping to land an office job, he signed up for the computer
classes, one of many short-term clerical and language courses are
primarily designed to help blue-collar workers find jobs in service
industries.
	   For 34-year-old Wong, being without a job is also an
opportunity.
	   ``I want to learn more skills,'' she said. ``If you have skills,
you have power.''

Former central bank manager pleads guilty to taking bribe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A former manager for Japan's central bank pleaded
guilty on Thursday to taking bribes from two banks, news reports
said.
	   Yasuyuki Yoshizawa, 42, admitted to charges he accepted 4.3
million yen (dlrs 30,500) _ in the form of dinners, drinks and golf
outings _ from the Industrial Bank of Japan and Sanwa Bank, the
reports said.
	   But Yoshizawa, the first central bank official to be charged
with bribery since the bank's founding in 1882, denied doing any
favors for the banks in return.
	   Yoshizawa, the former head of Capital Markets Division of the
Bank of Japan's Credit and Market Management Department, made the
plea at the opening of his trial at the Tokyo District Court.
	   Court officials refused to comment on the proceedings.
	   Prosecutors contend lavish wining and dining, and several
all-expenses-paid trips to fancy country clubs, induced Yoshizawa
to leak information to the banks about an important survey the
central bank uses in determining its interest-rate policy.
	   They also accuse Yoshizawa of intervening to have a penalty
against Sanwa dropped and helping Industrial Bank of Japan secure
central bank loans.
	   Over four years beginning in May 1993, Yoshizawa was entertained
by Industrial Bank of Japan executives 58 times and by Sanwa
officials 29 times.
	   After news of the scandal surfaced, former central bank head
Yasuo Matsushita tendered his resignation _ an unprecedented act
for a Bank of Japan governor.
	   Matsushita was not implicated in the scandal himself but
high-ranking officials in Japan are often forced to accept
responsibility for misdeeds by underlings.

<TEXT>
	   In Los Angeles, Ismael Valdes, reportedly close to being traded
to Seattle last week in a deal for Randy Johnson, pitched a
two-hitter as Los Angeles beat Oakland.
	   The Dodgers survived a scare in the ninth inning when left
fielder Roger Cedeno _ a defensive replacement _ dropped Scott
Spiezio's fly ball for a two-base error with one out. But Valdes
retired the next two batters.
	   Valdes, who entered the game having allowed 97 hits in 81 2-3
innings with a 5.18 ERA, outdueled Kenny Rogers, who allowed just
two hits and an unearned run in seven innings.
	   Valdes (5-7) walked one and struck out a season-high nine in
pitching his first complete game since Sept. 17, 1995.
 &UR; Padres 2, Reds 1 &QC; 
	   In San Diego, Ken Caminiti hit his first homer since April 23
and Kevin Brown matched his career high with 10 strikeouts as the
San Diego Padres beat the Cincinnati Reds 2-1 for a three-game
sweep.
	   Caminiti's eighth homer of the season _ and 100th in four
seasons with San Diego _ tied the score at 1 in the sixth, and
Wally Joyner singled in Quilvio Veras with the go-ahead run with
one out in the eighth.
	   The Padres won their fourth straight and, coupled with San
Francisco's loss to Seattle, regained a share of the NL West lead.
San Diego improved to 8-1 against Cincinnati this year and sent the
Reds to their season-high fifth straight loss.
	   Brown (6-3), who allowed one run and nine hits, improved to 6-0
in seven career starts against the Reds.

the rest of the Chicago Bulls might have just one more performance
together left _ and it could be the night they win their sixth
championship this decade.
	   ``We're ending up in a great position and we're in control,''
Jordan said. ``Now it's up to us to finish the job.''
	   The Bulls moved within one victory of another NBA title with an
86-82 victory over the Utah Jazz Wednesday night in Game 4 of the
NBA Finals.
	   Jordan and Pippen scored almost 75 percent of their team's
points, Rodman showed enough nerve to make two crucial free throws
and the Bulls played another 48 minutes of suffocating defense.
	   The win gave the Bulls a 3-1 lead and a chance to win the title
on their home floor for the third straight year when the series
resumes Friday night.
	   ``We're just trying to get through one more game, that's pretty
much it. Then I can stick (my uniform) in the trunk,'' Pippen said.
``We want it bad.''
	   Jordan finished with 34 points and Pippen had 28. Rodman, whose
bad boy behavior took over the focus for two days after he blew off
practice and left town to attend a pro wrestling match, grabbed 14
rebounds in his best game of the series.
	   ``We're in the driver's seat now,'' said Jordan, who along with
other star Bulls could be gone after this season. ``Basically,
you're going to have to wait and see what happens. I look at the
game as a must-win.''
	   ``I understand Scottie wants to take his uniform off and put it
in the trunk. I want to, too. They'll give out new ones next year _
wherever and whenever.''
	   The Jazz were again hurt by the disappearance of Karl Malone in
the fourth quarter. In his third poor game of the series, the
Mailman didn't score in the fourth until nine seconds remained _
way too late for the Jazz.
	   After showing some life when it looked like they were dead by
coming back from a seven-point deficit and tying the game, the Jazz
couldn't sustain the run and make enough big plays in the final
three minutes.
	   ``Tonight we had an opportunity and didn't take advantage of it.
They did,'' Malone said.
	   As in Game 2, the Jazz allowed Chicago to grab nearly every
important offensive rebound, including seven by Rodman and five by
Pippen.
	   Jordan had two late spin moves on Shandon Anderson. The first
gave the Bulls the lead for good; the second gave Chicago a
three-point lead with 1:38 left.
	   Jordan shot an airball with 48 seconds left, but Malone was
called for a loose ball foul when he got tangled with Rodman. The
Worm calmly sank both shots, making it 81-77 with 43.8 seconds
left, and Utah couldn't recover.
	   John Stockton drove for a reverse layup and missed, and the ball
was batted around by four players until Ron Harper grabbed it. Toni
Kukoc was fouled and made both shots with 26.6 second left, upping
the lead to six.
	   That was pretty much the end for Utah, which now faces a nearly
impossible task.
	   Only six teams in NBA history have come back from 3-1 deficits
in the playoffs, although it has never happened in the finals.
	   And the Jazz will have to find a way to win on Chicago's home
court, where the Bulls haven't lost in the finals since 1993.
	   ``It's not a good situation to be in,'' Stockton said. ``We have
one game to play, and if we win, it's a different situation. We go
home for two games and anything can happen. One win can change the
whole complexion of things.''
	   The Bulls, whose home winning streak reached seven games, have
won their last 26 playoff series when they led after three games.
	   Other than Jordan and Pippen, no one else reached double figures
for Chicago. Toni Kukoc had eight points and Harper and Rodman had
six each.
	   The Jazz, unable to run their offense smoothly because of
Chicago's size and tenacity on defense, shot only 42 percent and
also had just two players reach double figures.
	   Malone was Utah's leading scorer with 21 points, and Bryon
Russell reached 10 by making a meaningless 3-pointer at the final
buzzer.
	   Stockton shot 3-for-11 and Jeff Hornacek was 3-for-8.
	   The Jazz didn't reach 54 points _ their infamous total from
Sunday night's record-setting loss _ until Howard Eisley made a
free throw with 38.4 seconds left in the third.
	   Eisley's second free throw pulled Utah to 58-55, but Pippen
responded with a 3-pointer _ his fifth of the night _ to help give
the Bulls a 61-57 lead entering the fourth.
	   A pair of foul shots by Luc Longley gave the Bulls another
seven-point lead early in the fourth. But the Jazz came back, and
Stockton fed Chris Morris for a fast break layup with five minutes
left that gave the Jazz their first lead since the first quarter,
70-69.
	   However, the Jazz faltered down the stretch. Morris missed a 3
and Hornacek committed a loose ball foul, leading to a free throw
by Pippen that made it 79-75 with 1:21 left.
	   Hornacek's corner jumper with his foot on 3-point line with 1:05
left made it a two-point game again, but that was as close as Utah
would get.
	   Pippen made three 3-pointers in the first quarter when he and
Jordan combined to score 19 of Chicago's 21 points. Malone had 11
for the Jazz, who trailed 21-19 at the end of the quarter.
	   Jordan scored six more points in the second quarter, including a
finger-roll layup at the buzzer that gave Chicago a 39-37 halftime
lead.

Death toll in India from cyclone rises to 559, unclaimed bodies

	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Rescue workers, their faces covered with
handkerchiefs, lit the pyre at a mass cremation Thursday for more
than 100 victims of a cyclone that killed at least 559 people and
devastated India's western coast.
	   Most of the deaths _ 550 _ were in Gujarat state, where the
cyclone first hit land Tuesday. Gujarat's Kutch district was the
worst hit, with 423 deaths. Most of the victims were poor salt
workers who did not heed government warnings to leave their homes
before the cyclone hit.
	   The cyclone, with winds up to 100 kph (65 mph) when it first
hit, had weakened by the time it moved north later Tuesday, but
still killed nine people in neighboring Rajasthan state.
	   Soldiers distributed food for the second consecutive day in
relief camps set up for thousands of people left homeless. The
Times of India newspaper reported that prices of essential
commodities had shot up because of the scarcity.
	   Pravin Lehri, a top government official in Gandhinagar, 465
kilometers (290 miles) north of Bombay, said by telephone that the
mass cremation was held because bodies were deteriorating quickly.
	   ``We could not wait for relatives ... so we photographed the
bodies for identification later,'' he said, adding that most of the
victimes were found scattered around salt pans.
	   The bodies of more than 300 salt workers were recovered after
they were swept into the Arabian Sea or drowned by a 12-foot
(four-meter) tidal wave that lashed villages near the port of
Kandla, 530 kilometers (330 miles) northwest of Bombay.
	   The workers earn their living by erecting sand walls to trap sea
water, and collecting salt for sale after the water evaporates.
	   Newspapers said 50,000 people fled their homes when a gas tank
in Kandla sprung a leak Wednesday. The leak was later plugged.
	   Other deaths in Gujarat were caused by lightning, wall collapses
or drowning. At least six entire coastal villages in the area were
swept away.
	   Port equipment worth 200 million rupees (dlrs 4.7 million) was
destroyed. The estimates of total property loss in Gujarat are
estimated at 12 billion rupees (dlrs 284 million).
	   Heavy rain fell throughout western India and eastern areas of
neighboring Pakistan following the cyclone.
	   Pakistan's port city of Karachi was battered by rains blamed for
the deaths of 12 people Wednesday. Most of the dead, according to
the Associated Press of Pakistan, were electrocuted after high
winds toppled power lines and left live wires strewn across several
busy streets.
	   Two years ago, an even more devastating cyclone, with wind
speeds of more than 160 kph (100 mph), hit India's southeastern
Andhra Pradesh state. More than 1,000 people were killed, and crop
and property losses were staggering.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian police Thursday released
an opposition member of Parliament four hours after detaining him
for speaking at a political rally banned by authorities.
	   Lim Guan Eng, deputy secretary-general of the Democratic Action
Party, was taken to the Petaling Jaya police station at about 10.30
p.m. (1330 GMT) Wednesday shortly after he spoke to 2,000
supporters.
	   Three party members detained along with Lim were released with
him about four hours later early Thursday. Lim's three colleagues
had apparently tussled with policemen who were carting away
amplifiers and speakers used at the political rally. Police
dispersed the crowd shortly after midnight.
	   The four suffered minor cuts and bruises, Lim said.
	   ``We are not criminals,'' he told a news conference Thursday.
``There is no need to use force. If the police want to arrest us we
will allow ourselves to be arrested.''
	   Although police recorded their statements, no charges had been
pressed yet, he said. The four were allowed to leave the police
station after they refused to post bail or sign personal bonds, Lim
said.
	   A police spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
But police have said earlier that these meetings could jeopardize
public peace and security.
	   ``The police were the ones who initiated the breach of peace.
They were the threat and not the DAP,'' Lim said.
	   This is the fourth time police have shut down public meetings
over the past 10 days and the third time they have disbanded
opposition gatherings.
	   The DAP said it would go ahead with similar meetings every day,
irrespective of the ban.
	   ``With the government bent on establishing a police state, this
is the end of the freedom of expression in Malaysia,'' Lim said
Thursday night in a telephone interview from the police station.
	   Dozens of organizations have decried the crackdown as an assault
on civil liberties and free speech.
	   At Wednesday's fund-raising dinner for Lim _ who has been
sentenced to 18 months in prison for printing a pamphlet that
questioned Malaysia's political system _ police in riot gear had
stood watch. A required police permit for the gathering had been
denied.
	   A number of DAP leaders spoke during the dinner. Vehicles
clogged the road adjoining the field, where more than 60 dinner
tables had been placed for their supporters.
	   As the night continued, hundreds of people from the surrounding
neighborhoods also gathered to watch the spectacle. Shortly after
Lim began to speak, dozens of police in riot gear moved in to nab
him.
	   ``The event last night showed that the authorities have
blatantly and repeatedly violated legitimate civil rights,'' the
Malaysian human rights group SUARAM said in a statement Thursday.
	   ``Malaysia is lurching toward a police state,'' said Lim's
father, party secretary-general Lim Kit Siang and the opposition
leader in Parliament.
	   ``In Indonesia, the people who have been muzzled for three
decades are beginning to experience a new freedom of expression,''
said Lim Sr., as his son was led away. ``But in Malaysia, the
government has suddenly become afraid of the voice of the people.''

Government promises anti-racism campaign, but won't say when
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The federal government said Thursday it
will honor a more than two-year-old promise to introduce a campaign
to combat racism in Australia _ but not right away.
	   More than two years after the then-opposition promised a U.S.
dlrs 5.8 million (Australian dollars 10 million) anti-racism
campaign, the plan has not been put into practice.
	   The promise, part of the Liberal-National coalition's policies
for the 1996 election, was made amid a national debate over whether
an emerging new right-wing in Australian politics was fueling
racism.
	   Maverick lawmaker Pauline Hanson, a former coalition candidate,
was elected in 1996 and has helped keep the racism debate bubbling
with views such as that Asians are swamping Australia and that
welfare for Aborigines should be cut.
	   Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Minister Phillip Ruddock
on Thursday denied a plan he put to the Cabinet Wednesday to
introduce the anti-racism campaign before the next national
election had been rejected.
	   But he could not say when the campaign will be introduced.
	   Critics said they believe the government is delaying the
campaign's introduction to placate ``extreme'' elements within the
government, to maximize the conservative vote in a state election
this weekend and in an upcoming federal poll.
	   Prime Minister John Howard has said he may use Aboriginal land
rights legislation as a trigger for the election, which is due any
time after late this month.
	   Hanson has become a key player in the Queensland election this
weekend, the outcome of which will have a strong bearing on the
federal election. Polling suggests Hanson is eroding the
government's traditional voter base.
	   Ruddock said market research about the anti-racism campaign was
still being evaluated.
	   ``We are told ... there is the potential for a campaign to
exacerbate tensions within the community and to be
counterproductive,'' he said.
	   Federation of Ethnic Community Councils chairman Randolph Alwiss
said the campaign is important to curb bigotry and racism in the
community and should be introduced as soon as possible.
	   ``The government is pandering to the extreme elements, the
racist elements within and without its own ranks,'' he told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``I think they are concerned they will lose the extreme element,
and we are suspicious that this is leaving room for a race-based
election.''

Thai Education Ministry inspectors on lookout for student bettors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Education Ministry is
sending out more than 1,200 inspectors and volunteers to try and
stop students from betting on the World Cup soccer tournament.
	   Thongkoon Hongphan, director general of the Department of
Physical Education, said Thursday that 57 inspectors and 1,200
volunteers would be sent to city streets and areas popular with
youths to keep an eye out for students wagering on soccer.
	   He said the inspectors and volunteers would have the power to
detain student gamblers, who would then face disciplinary actions
from their schools.
	   The ministry has also set up six telephone hotlines for
complaints and tip-offs about students betting on the tournament.
	   The surveillance and hotlines will operate through July 14,
three days after the World Cup tournament, being played in France,
ends.
	   A research report by a local bank released Wednesday said more
students than ever are betting on soccer, and about 20 percent of
them are placing their bets through bookmakers.
	   The report said Thais nationwide will bet about 30 billion baht
(dlrs 680 million) on the World Cup, up 35 percent from what they
bet on the 1994 World Cup.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore slug

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Machinery orders by private-sector Japanese
manufacturers fell 16.8 percent in April from the month before, the
government said Thursday.
	   The so-called core orders component of the data, which exclude
orders considered volatile such as from electric power companies,
totaled 878.72 billion yen (dlrs 6.23 billion) in April, the
Economic Planing Agency said.
	   The orders, adjusted for seasonal factors, are regarded as an
early indicator of corporate capital spending over the six-to-nine
month period ahead.
	   The data is just the latest reinforcing the view that Japan's
slumping economy remains far from recovery and could be heading
into a deflationary spiral.
	   On Wednesday, the Finance Ministry reported capital investment
by Japanese companies declined by 5.8 percent during the first
quarter of this year from the same period last year.

Two teenagers killed as gym roof collapses on basketball team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two Israeli teen-age boys were killed when the
roof of their high school gym collapsed during a basketball game in
the southern city of Beersheba, officials said Thursday.
	   The roof of the Makif Vav high school caved in Wednesday evening
during a basketball game. Thirteen boys managed to get out, but the
bodies of Lior Kavalo, 13, and Shlomi Toledo, 14, were recovered
Thursday after firefighters and army engineers cleared the rubble.
	   The roof was being repaired because it leaked, Beersheba Mayor
David Bonfeld told Israel radio, and 22 tons of concrete had been
poured onto it. Police questioned six people including the engineer
responsible for the work, the radio reported.

U.S. dollar surges to 142 yen, Tokyo stocks finish sharply lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond
prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar surged to the 142-yen level
Thursday amid mounting concerns over the health of the Japanese and
other Asian economies. Tokyo stock prices finished sharply lower.
	   The dollar bought 142.01 yen by mid-afternoon, up 1.17 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
141.43 yen overnight.
	   It was the U.S. currency's highest intraday level against the
yen in Tokyo since September 6, 1990, when it was traded at 142.45
yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 325.22 points, or 2.12
percent, closing at 15,014.04 points. On Wednesday, the Nikkei sank
190.91 points, or 1.23 percent.
	   Currency traders said the dollar's advance was spurred by sharp
falls in share prices in Japan and Taiwan, leading to safe-haven
dollar-buying on rekindled fears of further financial turmoil in
Asia
	   ``The fall in stock prices of the two leading Asian economies
sparked fears of another round of Asian financial crisis,'' said
Hirokazu Note, deputy manager of the foreign exchange department at
Sumitomo Bank.
	   Also contributing to the dollar's rise was the lack of a firm
commitment to stem the yen's slide by the Group of Seven deputy
finance ministers who met in Paris on Wednesday, traders said.
	   Traders said statements from the meeting signaled no change in
G-7 policy on the yen.
	   Recent signs that Japan's economy is slowing, such as rising
unemployment and declining corporate profits, have hurt the yen.
	   Japanese officials, though, have warned that their currency may
have weakened excessively against the dollar, suggesting possible
yen-buying intervention.
	   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange continued to fall as
investors were discouraged by the continued weakening of the yen
against the dollar.
	   Among losers were banking issues, which sold off on renewed
concerns about the bad loans saddling Japan's financial system.
Investors are concerned that banks' problem loans overseas will
swell due to the weakening yen, traders said.
	   That weakness, which erodes the value of Japanese stocks held by
foreign investors, also hurt sentiment.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section shed 19.79 points, or 1.65 percent, to 1,178.81. The
TOPIX fell 10.08 points, or 0.83 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.245 percent from Wednesday's close of
1.195 percent, driving its price down to 111.68 yen from 112.06
yen.

Asian markets tumble further on weak yen, yuan devaluation fears
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stocks tumbled further early
Thursday as investors became increasingly worried about the weak
yen, which fell to a new seven-year low against the U.S. dollar.
	   The Japanese currency fell on the absence of yen-supportive
comments at a meeting of finance officials from the Group of Seven
industrialized nations, which ended Wednesday in Paris.
	   Most Asian currencies were also dragged down by the Indonesian
rupiah's plunge below the psychologically important level of 14,000
against the U.S. dollar early Thursday.
	   Sharp falls in share prices in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan
early Thursday also hit investors confidence in the region's
financial markets, traders said.
	   ``A lot of the direction in the market hinges on the dollar-yen
yen direction,'' said Andy Tan, a Singapore market specialist for
Standard and Poor's.
	   In Tokyo, the dollar bought 141.76 yen, up 0.92 yen from late
Wednesday in Tokyo, to a level not seen since early June, 1991. In
New York overnight, the currency settled at 141.43 yen.
	   Traders said the dollar's rise was spurred by sharp falls in
share prices in Japan and Taiwan, leading to safe-haven
dollar-buying on rekindled fears of further financial turmoil in
Asia.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 274.77
points, or 1.79 percent, moving to 15,064.49 at the close of
morning trading, adding to Wednesday's 1.23 percent-loss.
	   In Taiwan, shares ended at a five-month low as selling pressure
from margin maintenance calls and concerns over the weak local
currency dragged stocks down, analysts and traders said.
	   The Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange closed
12.39 points lower at 7,210.74.
	   In Hong Kong, share prices fell to new lows Thursday morning as
the benchmark index lost 3.1 percent just minutes after the opening
bell, hitting its lowest level since Feb. 1995.
	   But the Hang Seng Index later recovered on bargain hunting,
closing the morning session just 1.1 percent lower at 7,890.13
points. The index had lost 7.1 percent over the last two days.
	   In Jakarta, the rupiah hit an early low of 14,850 to the dollar,
a four-month low, but rose to 13,750 to the dollar in late morning.
Jakarta share prices also fell.
	   In Manila, stocks and the Philippine peso both plunged.
	   The key Philippine Stock Exchange Index dropped 4.6 percent to
1,829.02, its lowest level since January. The index has now lost
128.74 points over the past four sessions.
	   In Singapore, the key Straits Times Industrials Index dived
18.84 points, or 1.7 percent, within 15 minutes of opening
Thursday, continuing Wednesday's plunge.
	   But correction buying took over and the index shifted up and
down through the afternoon, and was 0.25 percent up in the early
afternoon.
	   The Singapore dollar weakened further, hitting 1.74 to the U.S.
dollar.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, shares closed lower at midday on a weaker
Malaysian ringgit and slumps in other regional stock markets.
	   The key Composite Index was at 479.80 points, down 2.1 percent.
	   In Bangkok, the key stock index was down 2.1 percent to 286.05
points in moderate trading at midday on investors' worries over
Thailand's deepening recession and the health of its financial
institutions. The baht also fell against the U.S. dollar.
	   New Zealand shares also fell for the 11th straight session, with
the key index falling nearly 59 points, or 2.8 percent, closing at
2,008.78 points.

Thousands of student protest outside of Indonesia's Parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IRWAN FIRDAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 4,000 university students
protested outside the Parliament Thursday demanding faster
democratic change and lower food prices.
	   Dozens of buses carrying students from several Jakarta campuses
arrived at the legislature.
	   Small groups of police and military personnel watched over the
peaceful rally outside the Parliament's iron gates.
	   Student organizers said they wanted what they described as a
``people's committee'' to be set up to act as a new Parliament
ahead of general election next year.
	   They also wanted the government to lower food prices and for
ex-President Suharto to be put on trial for corruption.
	   Demonstrations by students were a key factor in the push that
led to the resignation last month of Suharto, who had ruled for 32
years.
	   At the height of May's political turmoil more than 10,000
occupied the Parliament building for almost a week.
	   They left after Suharto stepped aside and was replaced as head
of state by his deputy and longtime friend B.J. Habibie who has
outlined a timetable for political reform between now and the end
of 1999.
	   However, Thursday's protest indicated that there is
dissatisfaction with the pace of change.
	   There is also resentment over rising inflation and mass
unemployment from the worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Critics of Suharto allege that he and his family amassed
billions of dollars and built huge business empires during his time
in office.

Peg architect: yuan devaluation won't damage Hong Kong's currency
</HEADLINE>
peg

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ An architect of Hong Kong's linked exchange
rate system said Thursday that the Hong Kong currency's peg with
the U.S. dollar wouldn't be shaken loose by a devaluation of
China's yuan.
	   Speaking at a conference on Asia's financial crisis, John
Greenwood, chief economist at LGT Asset Management, said the yuan
has depreciated by about 70 percent since the 1980s, but none of
the previous devaluations has hurt the Hong Kong dollar.
	   If market rumors of another yuan devaluation prove true, there's
no reason to expect the Hong Kong dollar would come under pressure,
he said.
	   ``I see no reason why Hong Kong's method of economic adjustment
should be changed just because there may be change (in the Chinese
yuan),'' he said.
	   Investors are fleeing the region on fears that the yen's
continuing slide would eventually lead to a yuan devaluation, which
would endanger Hong Kong dollar's peg to the U.S. dollar. This
would likely spark another round of currency devaluation in the
region.
	   Fueling the fear was mainland central bank governor Dai
Xianglong's earlier remark that the falling Japanese yen would
exert a negative impact on China's foreign trade, though the
People's Bank of China official reiterated a pledge to keep the
Chinese currency stable.
	   The Hong Kong government also is under increasing pressure at
home to float the Hong Kong currency as interest rates remain high,
making borrowing extremely difficult for local companies and eating
into their profits.
	   Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa reiterated Wednesday
that the government will stand by the 14-year currency peg, saying
letting it go would invite speculative attacks on the Hong Kong
currency.
	   Greenwood said it makes no sense for Hong Kong authorities to
bet there won't be a yuan devaluation.
	   ``It would be foolish for Hong Kong government officials'' to
pin their hopes on a stable yuan, Greenwood said. He said people
should be ready for a devaluation of the Chinese currency.
	   He also defended the linked exchange rate system he helped
establish for Hong Kong in 1983, saying if the city had a floating
exchange rate, it still would have suffered volatility from the
Asian crisis, though the pressure would have been reflected through
higher inflation, rather than higher interest rates.
	   Greenwood said that absent a better solution, critics of the peg
and those who say it's damaging Hong Kong's economy should come up
with a better solution and prove that it would have prevented the
troubles the domestic economy now faces.
	   ``Anybody who argues that the fixed rate is a disaster for Hong
Kong has got to show that an alternative strategy would have worked
better,'' Greenwood said.

Seoul subway workers call off strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with strike ending

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Seoul's subway workers ended a brief
strike Thursday after management promised to ``seriously'' consider
their demands for pay hikes and better working conditions.
	   The subway union's 9,000 members went on strike at dawn,
demanding a 7.8 percent pay hike, more welfare allowances and a
reduction in work hours from the present 42 to 40 per week.
	   They also demanded the reinstatement of seven union leaders
fired for earlier strikes outlawed by the government.
	   Union leaders, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
accepted management assurances that their demands would be
seriously considered, but declined to elaborate.
	   The 10-hour walkout failed to disrupt the normal running of
trains, which were operated by nonunion workers.
	   The central government ruled the strike illegal because it was
launched while the case was under review by the government's labor
arbitration committee.
	   At management's request, the government committee was to rule on
the case later Thursday. Under Korean law, a 15-day cooling-off
period is mandatory for a labor case under review by the committee.
	   The subway union has rejected the committee's role, accusing it
of siding with management. In past labor disputes, the union has
never honored the committee's role.

Nokia to expand GSM network in eastern China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ The Finnish telecommunications group
Nokia has signed a dlrs 200 million agreement to expand a digital
cellular network in China's Zhejiang province, the company said
Thursday.
	   The contract, with Zhejiang Mobile Communications Co., is
Nokia's fourth extension to the Global System of Mobile
communications network. Deliveries will begin immediately.
	   The expansion of the GSM 900 network will cover Wenzhou, Ningbo
and Taizhou.
	   Nokia views China as one if its most promising mobile phone
markets. Last year, it announced deals worth more than dlrs 750
million to supply mobile phone networks and equipment to Chinese
customers.
	   In 1994, the first official digital mobile phone call in China
was made on a Nokia mobile phone and network.
	   Last year, Nokia had a record pretax profit of 8.4 billion
markkaa (dlrs 1.55 billion) with net sales of 52.6 billion markkaa
(dlrs 9.8 billion). It employs more than 38,000 people worldwide.

Agassi, Courier named to U.S. Davis Cup quarterfinals team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVE HERMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Even in defeat, Andre Agassi showed U.S.
team captain Tom Gullikson why he deserves a spot in the Davis Cup
quarterfinals against Belgium.
	   Agassi suffered his first Davis Cup loss since 1990 in the first
round in April, ending a 16-match winning streak that tied the
American record set by Bill Tilden from 1920-26. But he didn't
sulk, whine or throw his racket.
	   ``He was obviously disappointed he didn't play better, but he
wasn't there really to keep the streak going or to break the
record. He was there to help our team win, which he did,''
Gullikson said Wednesday, announcing Agassi, Jim Courier, Todd
Martin and Richey Reneberg will represent the United States in the
quarterfinals against Belgium next month at the Indianapolis Tennis
Center.
	   It's the same quartet that survived the loss by Agassi and beat
Russia 3-2 in the first round.
	   ``I am delighted,'' Gullikson said. ``They are all very
committed to the team. In Davis Cup, that's the most important
thing, to have a passion for the team thing. Agassi, after getting
bounced, was out on the court 10 minutes later cheering for
Courier. That's the kind of team spirit you need.''
	   It's also why Gullikson isn't fretting over the failure to get
top-ranked Pete Sampras for the U.S. team.
	   ``I want to play the guys who want to be there,'' Gullikson
said. ``I did talk to Pete about playing and thought it would fit
into his schedule, but I guess he felt he needed a break after
Wimbledon and he declined the invitation. So I've got to
concentrate on the guys who are committed to Davis Cup.''
	   In April, Agassi lost to Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov. Courier
lost 10 of his first 11 games against Marat Safin in the fifth and
deciding match, but rallied to an 0-6, 6-4, 4-6, 6-1, 6-4 win to
save the United States from elimination. Earlier, Kafelnikov beat
Courier and Agassi beat Safin in singles, and Martin and Reneberg
beat Kafelnikov and Safin in doubles.
	   Belgium also beat the Netherlands 3-2. The United States and
Belgium have met twice before, with the Americans winning 4-1 in
1953 and 3-2 in 1957.
	   The quarterfinal matches will played July 17-19 on the hard
courts of the 8,461-seat Indianapolis Tennis Center, home of the
RCA Championships in August. The winner will play either Italy or
Zimbabwe on Sept. 25-27 in the semifinals at a site to be
determined.
	   Gullikson said the hard surface at Indianapolis should favor the
Americans, who have won a U.S. record 17 straight home-country
matches in Davis Cup play.
	   ``Our American players grow up on hard courts,'' he said. ``They
play most of their tennis on hard courts now, whereas the European
players grow up playing pretty much on the red clay during the
summer and indoors during the winter. So our game is more suited
for taking the ball on the rise and hitting very aggressive shots
that get rewarded.''
	   The Belgian team is led by Filip Dewulf, who reached the
quarterfinals at the French Open after the Davis Cup victory over
the powerful Dutch team.
	   Gullikson has watched all the Belgians ``and got a few scouting
notes'' but hasn't talked to his players specifically about their
next opponents.
	   ``Whoever you play, you need to respect what they've done,''
Gullikson said. ``With Russia, we knew what we were up against.
With Belgium, they've got some fine players, but we haven't played
against them much, so it's a little more of an unknown matchup.
We'll be ready for whatever happens, but mainly we have to take
care of our own preparation and be fit, because it's going to be
hot there in Indy.''

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The United States is signaling that it
wants NATO to organize air exercises in Albania and Macedonia as
defense ministers meeting here ponder potential military options to
halt ethnic carnage in Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, after a private meeting
with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, was conferring with his
15 NATO colleagues Thursday on possible steps the alliance could
take.
	   A U.S. official traveling with Cohen said the defense ministers
were ``likely to endorse ... planning for air exercises in Albania
and Macedonia.'' The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
pointed to comments made Wednesday in Washington by White House
Press Secretary Mike McCurry.
	   McCurry said there had been discussions about ``how, working
with Albania ... we could advance some planned exercises that we
have there that include an air element.''
	   He said the goal was ``to clearly indicate that NATO will define
and project its interests in the Balkans in a way that reminds the
Belgrade authorities of how seriously we take the violence that has
occurred in Kosovo, directed against the Kosovar Albanians.''
	   The ministers were expected to order military planners to take a
hard look at intervention options, such as sending in troops,
conducting air strikes or enforcing a no-fly zone over the troubled
province, where the Serb military is trying violently to quash an
independence movement by ethnic Albanians.
	   ``The worsening of the situation makes it more than advisable to
work out credible options for military action, to have them ready
for a political decision at any time,'' German Defense Minister
Volker Ruehe said.
	   NATO ambassadors worked late Wednesday on detailed instructions
for the military, including a clear statement of the objective for
any intervention.
	   Beyond possible air maneuvers over neighboring Albania and
Macedonia, the ministers also were debating moves to establish
military training and exercise centers and use of NATO transport to
help cope with refugee flows.
	   Speaking in Rome prior to flying to Brussels, Cohen said he
hoped the West would not have to resort to military action, but he
left the option open.
	   ``It is important to end this scandal of the bombing and
shelling of innocent people. We will work to achieve that at every
level _ diplomatic, economic and hopefully not military _ but we're
not ruling it out either,'' Cohen said at a news conference with
Italian Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta.
	   The Italian defense chief denounced the Serbs' use of arms
against civilians and declared: ``This scandal must end. We must
try to find a political solution.''
	   For two weeks NATO military planners have followed earlier
instructions to study indirect options for pressuring Yugoslavia
President Slobodan Milosevic, who is blamed for the Serbian
attacks. Among the options are dispatching up to 20,000 troops to
Albania and Macedonia to reinforce the existing 750-man U.N. force
in Macedonia and help both countries secure their borders while
dealing with refugees and arms smugglers.
	   In Kosovo, more than 250 people have died in clashes between
government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of
the Albanian independence movement. Ethnic Albanians, who comprise
90 percent of the southern province's population, demand
independence from Serbia, dominant of Yugoslavia's two republics.
	   The United States and its allies support autonomy for Kosovo but
oppose demands for independence and condemn violence on both sides.

Holmstrom's grinding play helps Red Wings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Tomas Holmstrom took the Stanley Cup back home to
Sweden with him last summer. With any luck, it will be among his
luggage again this year.
	   Only this time, the NHL's most prized hardware might not seem so
heavy.
	   Holmstrom was a rookie and played in only one of Detroit's 20
playoff games in 1997 when the Red Wings won the Cup championship
for the eighth time, breaking a 42-year drought. This season, he
has played in all 19 playoff games. He played a big role in
Detroit's 2-1 win over the Washington Capitals in Game 1 of the Cup
finals Tuesday night.
	   ``Tomas is very underrated physically,'' teammate Kirk Maltby
said after practice Wednesday. ``I know European players have that
reputation, of not liking to play the physical game. But Tomas is a
grinder. He gets under people's skin.
	   ``He'll take a hit and he's come up big for us in the
playoffs.''
	   Holmstrom had just five goals and 17 assists for 22 points while
playing in 57 games this season. And three of those assists came in
a season-ending 4-3 loss at Colorado on April 18.
	   During the playoffs, however, Holmstrom already has six goals
and 10 assists. He assisted on both Detroit goals in Game 1.
	   Game 2 will be played Thursday night at Joe Louis Arena. The
best-of-7 series then moves to Washington for Games 3 and 4,
Saturday and June 16.
	   ``The last couple of weeks, he's been right where we've needed
him: parked right in front of the net,'' Detroit forward Kris
Draper said. ``He's definitely a grinder. That's his great
strength.''
	   Of course, Holmstrom had visions of being a much bigger
contributor when the Red Wings made him their ninth pick in the
1994 draft. And coach Scotty Bowman admits it might have happened.
	   Part of the problem, however, was Bowman's love of veteran
players. Last year, he played behind Tomas Sandstrom. And just when
it looked like he'd get his big break this season, Detroit acquired
Brent Gilchrist.
	   ``Tomas never really gave up,'' Bowman said. ``He continued to
work hard. He worked a lot off ice.''
	   Holmstrom spent a lot of time working with assistant coach Barry
Smith. They spent much of the Olympic break together, since
Holmstrom wasn't selected for Team Sweden. They improved
Holmstrom's foot speed.
	   When he got his opportunity, shortly after the Olympics,
Holmstrom made the most of it.
	   ``We always felt he had a good scoring touch,'' Bowman said.
``You can watch him in practice. He can fool the goalies when he
gets in tight and he has the ability to go in front of the net.''
	   Holmstrom's willingness to get in the goalie's face brings
comparisons with Dino Ciccarelli, who took care of that job until
the Red Wings traded him in 1996.
	   ``We all have our roles on this team,'' Holmstrom said. ``Mine
is to create traffic in front of the net and try to stir things
up.''
	   And by contributing, he would feel like his name engraved on the
Cup is more than just a footnote. It would make him a whole lot
prouder to carry the Cup back home this summer.
	   ``I shouldn't feel that way, because I worked hard last year,
too,'' Holmstrom said. ``But you know, it was different because,
back then, I didn't play much.''

Cambodia's Ranariddh calls for ASEAN to shun coupmakers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Deposed Cambodian co-Prime Minister
Prince Norodom Ranariddh on Thursday called for the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations to expel any member country whose leader
came to power through a coup.
	   Cambodia was scheduled to become an ASEAN member last year, but
its entry was put off indefinitely because of the regional
grouping's concerns about political instability in the country.
	   Myanmar _ also known as Burma _ and Laos were admitted, joining
Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, the Philippines
and Vietnam.
	   Ranariddh, who was ousted last year as co-premier in a bloody
coup, said that if his FUNCINPEC party wins the upcoming elections
in July and he becomes prime minister, he will make the proposal
``for the sake of the future and fame of ASEAN.''
	   ``I will propose to ASEAN to introduce an amendment to their
statutes stating that any member that staged a coup must be banned
from it,'' Ranariddh said.
	   Ranariddh did not explain why he would make such a proposal, but
it was clearly an effort to underline what he believes is the
injustice of his ouster last July by forces loyal to co-premier Hun
Sen. With the power of the state behind him, Hun Sen is favored to
win the July polls.
	   Ranariddh said the anti-coup rule he was proposing was similar
to one applied by a Latin America regional grouping, which he did
not name but is presumably the Organization of American States. He
said the policy was introduced to discourage the once widespread
tradition of violent power grabs in Latin America.
	   Ranariddh said that an expelled country should be permitted to
regain its ASEAN membership only after it holds United
Nations-supervised democratic elections within six months of the
coup.
	   ASEAN has been traditionally wary of making any gestures that
could be seen as interference in member countries' internal
affairs, so it seems unlikely it would take up Ranariddh's
suggestion.

FINA committee recommends shorter distance semis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australian Swimming said Thursday
that a FINA technical committee has recommended the introduction of
semifinals for events up to 200 meters in the pool.
	   The committee, meeting in Vancouver, Canada, will now pass its
recommendation along to the FINA Bureau which is expected to
approve it, Australian officials said.
	   Australian Swimming president Terry Gathercole said semifinals
were expected to be introduced at next year's Pan-Pacific
Championships in Sydney to give swimmers a taste of the new format
before the Sydney Olympics.
	   Australia recently wrote to members of the technical committee
requesting FINA delay the introduction of semifinals until the 2001
world championships in Fukuoka, Japan, or at least limit them to
50- and 100-meter events in order to give swimmers more time to
adjust their programs to the changes.
	   ``It's no good dwelling on it,'' Australian coach Don Talbot
said Thursday. ``It's a little bit like the drugs issue. Those
things you can't change, you just have to deal with.''
	   Talbot admitted the new program would hit Australian swimmers
with bigger programs, like Michael Klim and Daniel Kowalski, harder
than other athletes and put increased pressure on the Australian
relays.
	   Klim won four golds, two silvers and a bronze medals at the
Perth world championships in January but the changes will probably
force him to drop one or two events from his program for Sydney.

Asian economic turmoil continues to hurt Australian tourism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The number of Asian tourists to
Australia has dropped severely this year because of the region's
economic crisis, Tourism Minister Andrew Thomson said Thursday.
	   The number of overseas visitors to Australia in 1998 is expected
to fall by around eight percentrm forecast was for
growth in tourism, with the number of international visitors
expected to increase by 5.4 percent next year, Thomson said.
	   He told the annual conference of the Inbound Tourism
Organization of Australia that the recent allocation of an extra
U.S. dlrs 30 million (Australian dollars 50 million) to the
Australian Tourist Commission will help foster new markets in the
United States and Europe and build a presence in emerging markets
such as China, India, Eastern Europe and Latin America.
	   It is hoped this will offset the fall in Asian tourists.
	   But the Tourism Council of Australia said its figures suggest
visitor arrivals will not return to 1997 levels until 2000.
	   ``An eight percent drop in visitor arrivals means 345,000 less
tourists to Australia this year or around U.S. dlrs 812 million
(Australian dollars 1.4 billion) in lost revenue,'' said Bruce
Baird, the council's managing director.

Bell out for England
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROTORUA, New Zealand (AP) _ A shoulder injury has delayed front
rower Duncan Bell's scheduled first appearance for England on
Saturday in the rugby union match against New Zealand A.
	   Sale loosehead prop Bell, 23, was withdrawn Thursday from the
touring side's opening match in New Zealand against the strong A
side at Hamilton after bruising his shoulder severely at training.
	   He will remain with the team following assurance by the
tourists' medical team the player would be fit to play by the end
of next week.
	   The front-row gap left by Bell will be filled by Tony Windo, a
late replacement on tour for injured test center Will Greenwood.
	   England coach Clive Woodward had decided an extra front rower
would be more useful for the team's five matches in New Zealand
than a midfield player. (djp)

Russia Central Bank reserves up to dlrs 15 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Central Bank's gold and foreign
exchange reserves inched up dlrs 400 million last week, according
to a news agency report Thursday.
	   Reserves rose from dlrs 14.6 billion on May 29 to dlrs 15
billion on June 5, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The bank has been widely criticized for being too slow to raise
rates and spending its reserves when the first selling hit Russian
markets last fall.
	   Reserves fell from nearly dlrs 23 billion last summer to dlrs 18
billion at the beginning of this year. Analysts estimate the cash
reserves of the bank now hover around dlrs 10 billion.

Two police officers suspended in corruption investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Two police officers have been suspended on
suspicion of serious corruption, Scotland Yard said Thursday, and a
newspaper reported that 20-40 officers are linked to contract
killings, robberies and big drug deals.
	   Scotland Yard Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon acknowledged
publicly this year that there was a core of deeply corrupt
officers, numbering 100-200, in the London force and promised a
crackdown.
	   London's Guardian newspaper said the biggest anti-corruption
drive since the late 70s is underway, and suspects include senior
detectives who have been explaining lavish lifestyles by saying
they inherited money or got lucky gambling.
	   The two officers were suspended after raids on their homes,
Scotland Yard announced.
	   ``Officers from the Police Complaints Investigation Bureau
searched the homes of two serving officers in the London area in
connection with an ongoing investigation of allegations of serious
corruption,'' said a statement released early Thursday.
	   ``A quantity of documentation has been seized and the two
officers have subsequently been suspended,'' it added.
	   The Guardian, quoting unidentified senior police sources, said
the corruption went way beyond the level of, for example, police
taking bribes and stealing in the 0s, and involved officers setting
up robberies and drug deals.
	   The newspaper said a specially appointed squad of 125 officers
are investigating allegations. Officers planning to give evidence
against former colleagues are living in safe houses because of
fears they will be threatened or smeared by the corrupt officers
seeking to undermine the inquiry.

History is against Jazz
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICK GANO &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ No team has ever rallied from 3-1 down in the NBA
Finals to win a championship. The Utah Jazz still believe they can
be the first.
	   But first they have to take care of Friday's Game 5. Find a way
to score and win at the United Center.
	   ``It's not a good position to be in but I don't feel it's
frustrating,'' John Stockton said. ``If we win, that's a different
situation. We'll be going home for two.
	   ``I'm not happy where we are, but with one win can we can change
the complexion and we can go back to our house and finish it off
ourselves.''
	   Strangely, Michael Jordan likened the Bulls' position to a meal.
	   ``I don't want to jump ahead of myself. Tonight was like an
appetizer, Friday could be the entree,'' Jordan said.
	   ``We can't fill ourselves up with just the appetizer. The job is
not done. We can taste it but we still have to finish the job.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; WHO'S THE MVP: Michael Jordan has been the MVP of the finals in
all five of his previous trips.
	   Scottie Pippen hasn't scored as many points but his defense has
been a key as the Bulls captured three of the first four games.
	   Bulls coach Phil Jackson admitted it would be a tough choice.
	   ``That's your call, not mine guys,'' Jackson told reporters.
``From my situation it would be difficult who would merit it. I
would say it's between Michael and Scottie and you got a real tough
choice.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; NUMBERS: Michael Jordan became the leader in field goal
attempts in NBA playoff history. Jordan attempted 27 shots and
moved past Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (4,422). Jordan has attempted 4,436
shots. ... The Bulls were 17-of-24 from the line in the fourth
quarter Wednesday to only 2-of-3 for the Jazz. ... Jordan has
scored at least 20 points in a finals-record 33 straight games.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BEST QUESTION: Dennis Rodman's defense on Karl Malone, his
rebounding and his clutch free throws were all part of the Chicago
Bulls' victory Wednesday night.
	   So what did a lot of people want to know?
	   Will Rodman show up for practice Thursday?
	   ``That's the dlrs 10,000 question right there,'' Bulls coach
Phil Jackson said. ``I expect Dennis to be here tomorrow with bells
on. We won't do much practicing.''
	   Rodman skipped a practice this week and ended up at a wrestling
show in Detroit.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DON''T WANNA GO: Leave it to Dennis Rodman to worry about his
social life should the NBA Finals return to Utah. The Jazz,
trailing 3-1, would have to win Friday night for that to happen.
	   ``I don't want to go back,'' Rodman said.
	   ``My life just goes to complete hell when I go to Utah. That
means I have to revert to going back to Las Vegas or going
somewhere to get some excitement, to keep my mind rolling.''
	   After the Bulls lost Game 1, Rodman hopped on a plane and went
to Las Vegas for an early morning of gambling. This week he skipped
practice and ended up in Detroit at a wrestling show.
	   The Worm does get around.
	   ``We need to concentrate and not fly there,'' Rodman said of
Utah. Last year, he was fined dlrs 50,000 for his derogatory
comments about Mormons during the NBA Finals.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; READY TO PARTY: The city of Chicago has already scheduled its
championship rally should the Bulls win a sixth title.
	   Win the next game and the Bulls would appear at downtown Grant
Park on Monday. If the Bulls clinch in Sunday's sixth game, the
rally would be Tuesday. If it goes seven and the Bulls win, the
rally is set for Friday, June 19.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; OPEN YOUR WALLET: Ticket brokers say prices for Wednesday
night's Game 4 ranged from dlrs 350 to dlrs 550 for cheap seats to
dlrs 9,000 for courtside. Pushing the prices up is the possibility
Michael Jordan is playing his final games in Chicago.
	   That's why seats are projected to cost even more for Friday's
Game 5.

Osgood has been just great for Red Wings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN RAPPOPORT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Hockey Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Forget Olaf Kolzig. Suddenly, the Detroit Red
Wings are getting the best goaltending in the Stanley Cup playoffs.
	   With two shutouts in the Dallas series and a 2-1 victory over
Washington in the first game of the finals, Chris Osgood has
quietly made a mark for himself in the postseason.
	   ``I think Ozzie is as good a goalie as most in this league,''
Capitals coach Ron Wilson said as his team prepared for Game 2 of
the Finals tonight at Joe Louis Arena. ``It's funny, if you let a
bad goal in or make a mistake, everybody wants to jump on you, look
for a chink in your armor. I thought he was very solid (Tuesday
night).''
	   Osgood only had to face 17 shots in Game 1, while Washington's
Kolzig faced 31. But he was sharp in the third period when the Red
Wings were clinging to a one-goal lead and the Capitals had a
number of great opportunities to tie the game.
	   ``Osgood made a couple of big saves,'' Kolzig said. ``It could
have gone into overtime, who knows?''
	   This could be a career-turning series for Osgood, who in his
fifth season with the Red Wings is still trying to live down past
failures.
	   One picture quickly comes to mind: Osgood crying in the locker
room following a series upset by the San Jose Sharks in the first
round of the 1994 playoffs. He was vilified in Detroit for that
defeat.
	   Another picture: sharing the blame with Mike Vernon in the 1995
finals sweep by the New Jersey Devils.
	   Now, Osgood is trying to live up to Vernon's accomplishment of
winning last year's finals against the Philadelphia Flyers. Vernon
was eventually traded to San Jose and Osgood given the No. 1
goaltending job.
	   While carrying a reputation as a goalie who occasionally gives
up soft goals, Osgood has also helped to carry the Red Wings into
the finals.
	   ``Obviously, he's a very good goaltender,'' Washington's Joe
Juneau said. ``Nobody's going to reach the finals without a good
goaltender.''
	   Not that the playoffs have been a smooth ride for Osgood. Before
the Red Wings pulled out the Western Conference finals with Dallas,
the Detroit goalie allowed some questionable goals _ including a
long shot by Jamie Langenbrunner that gave the Stars a 3-2 overtime
victory in Game 5.
	   But Osgood came back with a 2-0 victory in the series clincher
two days later. That gave him a 12-6 record, 2.22 goals-against
average and .916 save percentage going into the finals.
	   It appeared to give him some momentum for Game 1 of the
championship series. And winning that one further prepared him for
tonight's game.
	   ``I haven't seen them much,'' Osgood said of the Capitals. ``I
wasn't really used to playing against them. I didn't know their
players' tendencies or what they like to do with the puck. I think
I learned a lot from the last game of what they like to do.''
	   Detroit coach Scotty Bowman couldn't have been happier for
Osgood after his strong Game 1 performance.
	   ``That was a big game for Chris,'' Bowman said. ``His first game
of the finals. He was coming off a shutout (in Game 6 of the
Western Conference finals). What can we say?
	   ``I don't think we have to discuss Chris much more. Just look at
his record. It speaks for itself.''
	   Earlier, Kolzig was a goalie everyone has been talking about in
the playoffs. He has been showing the way for the Capitals since
the start. In 17 games prior to the finals, he was 12-5 in 17 games
with a playoff-leading .946 save percentage, four shutouts and 1.69
goals-against.
	   The Red Wings beat him Tuesday night by doing what a team has to
do against any hot goalie _ create traffic in front of the net and
just keep firing.
	   That's what they have in mind for tonight.
	   ``I guess for Game 2, we would like to get a lead and keep
bearing down and stay aggressive,'' Red Wings captain Steve Yzerman
said.

Wallabies told to stop intake of supplement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Nearly half of Australia's rugby
union test players have been told to stop taking a dietary
supplement under investigation by the Australian Sports Drug Agency
(ASDA) and the International Olympic Committee.
	   Up to 10 players have admitted to taking
Beta-Hydroxy-Beta-Methyl-Butyrate, or HMB. One player was consuming
almost three times the recommended daily dose.
	   HMB is not on the Australian drug agency's or the IOC's list of
banned substances. It is said to help repair muscle damage although
ASDA was still conducting evaluation on its makeup and possible
short and long-term side effects.
	   The Wallaby players, who were not named, came from all three
Super 12 sides in Australia _ New South Wales, Queensland and ACT.
	   Australian Rugby Union chief executive John O'Neill confirmed
players were being urged to stop using the substance while its
effects were unknown.
	   ``The recommendation of the ARU doctor John Best is that they
not take it,'' he said.
	   O'Neill said the concern was not over the legality of the
substance but that potential effects were unknown to ASDA.
	   ``This HMB is not a banned substance but players need to be very
well informed and educated about all substances,'' he said. (djp)

Wilson plays 50th test in Scotland match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australian flanker David Wilson plans
to share the honor of his 50th rugby union test against Scotland on
Saturday with the man who stalled his international career for two
years.
	   Wilson wants former Queensland teammate and current Wallaby
assistant Jeff Miller to be part of the celebrations when he takes
the field at Sydney Football Stadium against the same opposition
and on the same ground as in his test debut six years ago.
	   Reserve back Jason Little, who with Wilson made his Queensland
debut in the 1989 tour match against Cuyo in Argentina, will also
win his 50th test cap if he gets a run off the bench against
Scotland.
	   While Wilson's test debut came two seasons after Little's, he
made up time on his teammate who had a serious knee injury in 1994
and then a broken collarbone last year.
	   ``I was Jeff's understudy for a long time and he was a great guy
to be around,'' Wilson said.
	   ``He was a guy that I molded my style on and it was probably
good I wasn't rushed into the Queensland side back in 1989.''
	   Wilson hopes Scotland will be better opposition than England was
last week in a 76-0 loss to Australia.
	   ``We hardly needed to defend against England, whereas you go
into a test against New Zealand and struggle to get 50 percent of
the ball,'' Wilson said. ``The Scots are always a good team to
play, they play it hard but always fair.'' (djp)

NHL hasn't made decision yet on returning to Olympics: Bettman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN RAPPOPORT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Hockey Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ If nothing else, the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake
City would have Nagano beat on logistics. Ask NHL commissioner Gary
Bettman.
	   ``There would be less travel and less jet lag,'' Bettman says.
	   Deciding whether the NHL will go back to another Olympics,
however, is another story. Talking informally at the Stanley Cup
finals on Wednesday, Bettman said it was too early to determine
whether the league wanted to do it again.
	   ``We will evaluate the Olympics after the season is over,'' he
said. ``We have to look at data and see how it impacted the
season.''
	   Bettman also discussed lower attendance, declining TV ratings,
rules changes and concussions.
	   While Bettman felt the Olympics achieved its desired result of
getting more attention for the league, some of it was unwanted.
	   The Czech Republic won the gold medal by beating Russia, the
U.S. team came home in disgrace following an early-round exit and
the trashing of a dorm room.
	   Bettman said the fact that neither the United States nor Canada
was in the finals hurt the NHL's purpose.
	   ``The Olympic experience was a terrific tournament,'' he said.
``My personal rooting interest aside, we never went into the
Olympics with those expectations (of having the U.S. and Canada
play for the gold medal). We went in saying that any one of six
teams could win, and that's just what happened.''
	   He also shrugged off the drawbacks of an extended NHL season
because of the Olympics. If the Detroit-Washington series goes
seven games, the NHL season will end June 23 _ the first time the
league will have played a season in fall, winter, spring and
summer.
	   Bettman also said that while TV ratings and attendance were
slightly down, he didn't think ``the game is on hard times. It just
needs fine adjustments.''
	   ``You take away Carolina, which is a temporary situation, we
were off 1 percent (at the gate) after two record years,'' he said.
	   The Hurricanes played in Greensboro, North Carolina, while
waiting for an arena to be built in Raleigh, some 100 miles (160
kilometers) away.
	   With scoring down in the league, Bettman said the NHL was
considering moving the goal farther from the end boards.
	   ``It encourages forechecking and makes it more difficult for the
goaltender to handle the puck,'' Bettman said. ``That would
accomplish what we are trying to do.''
	   The board of governors will meet later this month to consider
that and other rules changes.
	   Bettman also said the league hoped to reduce the number of
concussions, perhaps making penalties more severe for offenders who
cause such injuries.

U.S. Ambassador: Malaysia must reassure cagey investors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia must stop accusing
foreigners of trying to control the country by pummeling its
financial markets if it wants to woo back jittery overseas
investors, the U.S. Ambassador said.
	   Foreign investors are still keen on Malaysia, but are concerned
about being the target of relentless government criticism, U.S.
Ambassador John Malott told the Malaysian national news agency
Bernama in an interview Wednesday in Washington.
	   ``American companies see opportunities in the crisis but at the
same time they do not want to be seen as opportunists or vultures
buying up Asian real estate at fire-sale prices,'' Malott said.
	   A prolonged economic crisis in Asia, precipitated by Thailand
floating its currency last July, has severely hampered the
once-booming economic growth of countries such as Malaysia,
Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has continued to claim
foreign currency speculators are bent on devaluing the ringgit and
quashing share prices on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange.
	   Since July, the ringgit has plunged 36 percent against the
dollar while the prices of equities on the KLSE have fallen over 50
percent.
	   Speaking to key government and business leaders in Tokyo earlier
this month, Mahathir said foreign investors ``move freely and
exploit business potential without regard for citizenships or
loyalties.''
	   Without specifying who they were, he said that such ``new
capitalists'' were looking for opportunities to ``dominate the
world and make lots of money'' at the expense of Asian governments.
	   Malott disagreed, saying foreign investors were more concerned
about the government's opaque dealings behind closed doors.
	   ``Foreign companies, particularly minority shareholders, are
concerned about sudden changes,'' Malott told Bernama.
	   ``They don't want to find out in the next day's newspaper that
the company they have invested in has restructured or has loaned
money to some other company without their prior knowledge.''
	   Malott and U.S. ambassadors from other Southeast Asian nations
are currently speaking to U.S. business leaders about the
investment climate of Asian countries.

New Nigerian leader's promises draw denunciations from opposition

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's opposition, upset over the
appointment of a new military ruler, has called for a nationwide
strike as a first step in a renewed campaign for democracy.
	   Two days after assuming power, and a day after promising a
return to civilian rule, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar appeared
Wednesday to be consolidating his power base in Africa's most
populous nation.
	   Two members of his inner circle were under house arrest in the
capital, Abuja, two independent sources confirmed Wednesday on
condition of anonymity.
	   Nigeria's boisterous opposition movement, denouncing Abubakar as
nothing new, said Wednesday it planned to challenge his appointment
in court and called for a nationwide strike for democracy.
	   Gani Fawehinmi, a Lagos attorney and one of the country's
best-known opposition activists, said he would file suit in the
Nigerian high court challenging Abubakar's appointment to replace
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, who died Monday.
	   Fawehinmi said there was nothing in Nigerian law to say that a
chief of defense staff succeeds the head of state in Africa's most
populous nation.
	   ``Nigerians must intensify their struggle to end military
rule,'' Fawehinmi said.
	   The denunciations _ by an opposition tired of decades of
oppression _ followed a televised speech Tuesday by Abubakar, who
promised to proceed with a transition to civilian rule that Abacha
began. He gave no details on how that would happen.
	   ``The empty maiden address of Gen. Abubakar has confirmed that
there is no hope for Nigeria in Abacha's successor,'' said
Fawehinmi, speaking at a press conference on behalf of the umbrella
opposition group, the Joint Action Committee for Nigeria.
	   He said the group would go ahead with demonstrations in Lagos
planned for Friday, the fifth anniversary of annulled presidential
elections that were apparently going to be won by Moshood Abiola, a
billionaire businessman now in prison.
	   The group called on people to observe a nationwide 24-hour
strike, staying away from their jobs and keeping off the roads. It
also urged them not to recognize Abubakar's government.
	   It was not clear just how many people would heed the calls for a
strike. Similar calls for demonstrations have sometimes resulted in
only a few hundred people turning out.

Duma prepares bill to ban Yeltsin from seeking third term
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian parliament's lower house gave
preliminary approval Thursday to a bill intended to prevent
President Boris Yeltsin from seeking a third term.
	   Yeltsin's uncertain health and a constitutional limit of two
terms would appear to rule out another bid and the president
himself has said he won't run. Yet presidential aides have hinted
that the 67-year-old leader might again seek office in 2000.
	   They claim that Yeltsin's first term began during Soviet times
and thus didn't count toward the two-term limit. The Constitutional
Court is expected to rule on the issue later this year.
	   If the court clears Yeltsin for the race, the new bill would
prove futile. Its author, Alexei Zakharov, a member of the liberal
Yabloko faction, insisted the bill was still necessary to prevent a
president who served two terms from even trying to register for a
new race.
	   If he does, legal protests from other candidates may stall the
presidential election, Zakharov warned.
	   Alexander Kotenkov, Yeltsin's representative to the lower
chamber, the State Duma, dismissed the bill as ``senseless'' and
called on lawmakers to wait for the court's ruling.
	   The Duma ignored his protest, passing the bill on the first
reading by a vote of 309 to none, with one abstention. To become
law, the bill must receive the Duma's final approval after two more
readings, clear the upper house and be signed by Yeltsin.
	   Meanwhile, Communists and other Yeltsin foes in the Duma on
Thursday put off their latest impeachment attempt against the
president.
	   The Duma must create a commission comprising representatives of
all factions to prepare an indictment. The attempt hit a snag this
week when the pro-government Our Home Is Russia faction said it
wouldn't take part in the panel.
	   Lawmakers decided earlier this week they would try to tackle the
issue at the Duma's agenda-setting council on Thursday, but they
didn't even bring it up. It wasn't clear why the council avoided
the issue.
	   Previous impeachment motions have died before reaching the
floor, partly because Russia's Constitution gives the president the
upper hand in confrontations with parliament.

Central government to elected village officials: Operate openly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's villages must be run more openly and
democratically, top government and Communist Party leaders say in a
new order sent to rural communities, state media reported Thursday.
	   The circular says village leaders can no longer make decisions
in secret about spending public money for development projects,
leasing out farm land, birth control and distribution of relief
funds.
	   Democratic and open village government is needed to improve
relations between the ruling Communist party and the people and to
promote rural development and stability, according to the new
order, which was issued by the party's policy-making Central
Committee and the State Council, the highest government body.
	   China has had a national law establishing elections at the
village level since 1987. The Ministry of Civil Affairs has
promoted secret ballots, candidate speeches and fair election
procedures throughout the country.
	   But the new order suggested that elections alone have not
guaranteed that villages run their affairs democratically or have
been able to rid themselves of local bullies.
	   It also showed that the central government wants to ensure that
the countryside does not erupt in unrest. The order was played
prominently on the front page of the People's Daily, the main
newspaper of the Communist Party.
	   Rural people, who make up 70 percent of China's 1.2 billion
people, are the Communist Party's ``reliable force'' and ``the
broadest and deepest mass base for political power in our
country,'' the government's order said.
	   It called for several specific improvements in how China's 1
million villages are run.
	   Each village must post a report about village affairs at least
every three months. Villagers also are supposed to keep tabs on
their leaders by forming congresses of all village residents or
representatives. Leaders should make decisions based on the
majority's views, the order says.
	   Officials also are ordered to make public their own salaries and
performance reviews. The order also warns that vote buying is
illegal.
	   ``Malpractice by a few officials acting willfully regardless of
the villagers' wishes must be corrected resolutely,'' it said.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Endorsing a global campaign against drugs,
150 nations have pledged to coordinate efforts to reduce demand,
curb money-laundering and sharply cut the supply of narcotics in
the next 10 years.
	   ``We are not starting a new `war on drugs''' Pino Arlacchi, head
of the U.N. Drug Control Office, told delegates Wednesday at the
end of their three-day U.N. special session on drugs.
	   A better analogy, he said, was ``a doctor facing a deadly
disease. Drugs quite simply kill people. And it is our
responsibility to find the cure.''
	   The summit ended with participants approving a 31-page plan for
governments to work together to curb trafficking, reduce demand,
improve judicial cooperation, combat money-laundering and reduce
the cultivation of narcotic crops.
	   Despite the approval, delegates were divided about how to wage
the campaign. Leaders of drug-producing countries in Latin America
and Asia said the United States and other consumer nations must
reduce demand.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, who addressed the conference
Monday, announced a dlrs 2 billion media campaign against drugs.
But he refused to endorse one of the pillars of the U.N. program:
financial incentives to persuade Third World farmers to quit
growing narcotic crops.
	   U.N. officials estimate the program will cost more than dlrs 250
million annually for 10 years.
	   Singapore defended its policy of mandatory executions for drug
traffickers. The Netherlands and Switzerland argued their
approaches _ such as tolerating ``soft drugs'' and prescribing
heroin to addicts _ are the best way to curb drug-related crime.
	   ``I wish to repeat this loud and clear here: Switzerland is not
moving toward drug liberalization,'' Swiss Vice President Ruth
Dreifuss said.
	   Dreifuss said Switzerland's controversial program to prescribe
heroin to hardcore addicts had enabled authorities to ``reach
high-dependent drug addicts who had tried other forms of therapy
but without success.''
	   Some private drug research organizations said the United Nations
was focusing too much attention on law enforcement programs, such
as tracing and confiscating drug profits.
	   ``Like the drug war itself, the U.N. drug summit was a
failure,'' said Dr. Ethan Nadelmann, director of the Lindesmith
Center. ``Rather than producing the intended unity, the drug summit
exposed deep divisions ... between drug war zealots who advocate
spending on a failed policy and the reformers who want new
approaches.''

Israel destroys Hebron family's house for third time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops bulldozed the home of a
Palestinian family on Thursday that had been twice rebuilt after
earlier demolitions. Scuffles broke out between the soldiers and
family members and neighbors, who threw stones and bottles.
	   Israeli peace activists had helped rebuild the Atrash family's
home in the West Bank town of Hebron in March, after it was razed
on grounds that it was built without a permit.
	   The house is built near an Israeli bypass road that is intended
to allow Jewish settlers and other Israelis to travel through the
West Bank without entering Palestinian towns.
	   Ten people lived in the house.
	   Zahour Atrash, 38, shouted for help as the house was torn down,
and vowed ``We will take revenge.''
	   ``The Israelis are destroying houses, the Israelis don't want
peace,'' she said. ``I will raise all my children to become Hamas
extremists.''
	   The Palestinians say Israel refuses to issue building permits in
areas of the West Bank it wants to keep under its control. Israel
says the demolitions are legitimate means of enforcing zoning
regulations.

Rodman gets himself out of doghouse with big game
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Only Dennis Rodman can upstage Dennis Rodman.
	   The NBA's bad boy was at his baddest Wednesday, and the Chicago
Bulls couldn't be happier with the result. Who cares that he
skipped practice, went wrestling and managed to throw the five-time
champions into an uproar?
	   When he grabs 14 rebounds and makes four huge free throws down
the stretch to help seal an 86-82 Chicago victory over the Utah
Jazz, the Worm can do just about anything he pleases.
	   ``Why else is he here?'' teammate Steve Kerr said. ``He's a
great defender, a great rebounder. He provides great energy, he
makes clutch free throws. That's the reason we put up with
Dennis.''
	   Chicago leads the best-of-7 series 3-1. Game 5 is Friday at the
United Center.
	   Rodman is at his best when the spotlight is on him, and he made
sure its white-hot light stayed on him Wednesday. Scottie Pippen
had his best game of the playoffs, scoring 28 points and grabbing
nine rebounds, but it was Rodman who had the play of the game.
	   With 44 seconds left, Rodman and Karl Malone wrestled _
appropriately enough _ for a rebound. They fell to the floor with
their arms wrapped around each other, and there was a split-second
hesitation before the referees whistled Malone for the foul.
	   Rodman, who was a Shaquille O'Neal-like 55 percent from the
free-throw line in the regular season, calmly stepped to the line
and hit both of his shots. That gave Chicago an 81-77 lead and all
but clinched the game.
	   A few minutes earlier, he also went 2-for-2 from the line.
	   ``He was really our most reliable free-throw shooter tonight,''
coach Phil Jackson said, smiling. ``The much-maligned Dennis Rodman
had a wonderful game for us. As usual, he takes himself out of the
hole and finds a way to redeem himself.''
	   Rodman had a bigger-than-usual hole to crawl out of this time. A
day after Chicago's record-setting 42-point humiliation of the Jazz
in Game 3, the poster boy for bad behavior decided he just couldn't
be bothered with practice.
	   While the rest of his teammates watched film and met with the
media in a mandatory question-and-answer session, Rodman dined at
Hooters and then jetted off to Detroit for a professional wrestling
spectacle.
	   The NBA fined Rodman dlrs 10,000, and his teammates spent two
days answering questions about the guy with more moods than hair
colors or tattoos.
	   ``All the media and the TV people here made it more than what it
was. It wasn't all about that,'' Rodman said. ``I didn't do that to
embarrass my team or try to get in the spotlight. I can do that any
day.''
	   But Rodman did seem a little contrite Wednesday. For starters,
he appeared at the United Center at 6:43 p.m., only 15 minutes late
instead of his usual 30 or 35.
	   And when Jackson put him in, Rodman made his presence known
immediately. He had six rebounds in the first half, including four
on the offensive glass. More importantly, he took the slack off of
a struggling Luc Longley and put the clamps on Malone.
	   ``I had a shocking game, I didn't get anything done tonight,''
Longley said. ``Dennis is a very clever defender and he really does
use his body well. He is a lot stronger than he looks. He's wiry
and strong. He knows how to get people off-balance by moving them
around.''
	   Then there were his free throws. With the score tied at 72 with
2:53 left, Rodman was fouled by Shandon Anderson. His first shot
bounced around the rim five times before dropping through the net,
and Rodman grimaced the entire time the ball was rolling.
	   When he made the second one, he turned around and hugged Pippen.
	   ``The most surprising thing would be his free throws down the
stretch,'' Longley said. ``That's un-Dennis, but was just what we
needed.''
	   The Bulls have given up trying to figure out what makes Rodman
tick. Despite his weirdness and his endless quirks, he always seems
to come through when the Bulls need him the most.
	   So what will Rodman do next? Who knows, Jordan said. More
importantly, who cares?
	   ``I can never figure this guy out, I don't even start,'' he
said. ``One day he's wrestling, the next day he's defending. We
have come to live with it and move forward, and not really try to
dissect this individual.
	   ``I don't even know if he is an individual.''

NATO defense ministers look at possible action on Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The United States is signaling it wants
NATO to organize air exercises in Albania and Macedonia as defense
ministers meeting here consider military options to halt ethnic
carnage in Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, after a private meeting
with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, was conferring with his
15 NATO colleagues Thursday on possible steps the alliance could
take.
	   A U.S. official traveling with Cohen said the defense ministers
were ``likely to endorse ... planning for air exercises in Albania
and Macedonia.'' The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
pointed to comments made Wednesday in Washington by White House
Press Secretary Mike McCurry.
	   McCurry said the goal was ``to clearly indicate that NATO will
define and project its interests in the Balkans in a way that
reminds the Belgrade authorities of how seriously we take the
violence that has occurred in Kosovo, directed against the Kosovar
Albanians.''
	   British Defense Minister George Robertson said NATO must make
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``think again'' about what he
is doing.
	   ``Air strikes are only one of the options that NATO ministers
will be considering,'' Robertson said as he arrived at NATO
headquarters. ``In Belgrade they have to know that the NATO
ministers here today are not ruling out any options at all.''
	   The ministers were expected to order military planners to take a
hard look at intervention options, such as sending in troops,
conducting air strikes or enforcing a no-fly zone over the troubled
province, where the Serb military is trying violently to quash an
independence movement by ethnic Albanians.
	   ``We have to plan for meaningful military measures,'' said
German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, but stressed that those
measures had to be ``parallel to the political process. This is not
an internal affair, it concerns stability and human rights in
Europe.''
	   Beyond possible air maneuvers over neighboring Albania and
Macedonia, the ministers also were debating moves to establish
military training and exercise centers and use of NATO transport to
help cope with refugee flows.
	   Speaking in Rome prior to flying to Brussels, Cohen said he
hoped the West would not have to resort to military action, but he
left the option open.
	   ``It is important to end this scandal of the bombing and
shelling of innocent people. We will work to achieve that at every
level _ diplomatic, economic and hopefully not military _ but we're
not ruling it out either,'' Cohen said at a news conference with
Italian Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta.
	   For two weeks NATO military planners have followed earlier
instructions to study indirect options for pressuring Milosevic.
Among the options are dispatching up to 20,000 troops to Albania
and Macedonia to reinforce the existing 750-man U.N. force in
Macedonia and help both countries secure their borders while
dealing with refugees and arms smugglers.
	   In Kosovo, more than 250 people have died in clashes between
government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of
the Albanian independence movement. Ethnic Albanians, who comprise
90 percent of the southern province's population, demand
independence from Serbia, dominant of Yugoslavia's two republics.
	   The United States and its allies support autonomy for Kosovo but
oppose demands for independence and condemn violence on both sides.

Iraqi government urged to stop helping U.N. arms chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be led after Butler's arrival, scheduled for about
1000GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's most influential newspaper urged the
government to stop cooperating with chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler who begins a crucial disarmament mission Thursday.
	   The ``time has come to chop the tongue of this dog,'' the Babil
newspaper, owned by President Saddam Hussein's son, Odai, said.
	   It is also time Iraq halted ``courting this mad dog,'' said
Babil, repeating the insult that Iraqi newspaper have often used in
referring to Butler.
	   Babil said its remarks were in reaction to Butler's refusal to
accept Iraqi claim that it has no more information to give to the
United Nations on its illegal weapons programs and weapons.
	   Iraq says it has destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction,
as required by the U.N. Security Council, and that the U.N. must
now lift the economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
	   Butler, who heads the United Nations Special Commission, says he
needs more evidence from the Iraqis supporting their claims.
	   Butler arrives later Thursday for talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz aimed at eliciting that evidence. He will be
accompanied by 18 senior U.N. arms experts who are carrying
satellite images, charts and material evidence to back UNSCOM's
position that Iraq is also hiding information on illegal weapons.
	   The Iraq-U.N. dispute has the potential for a crisis similar to
the one earlier this year when Iraq refused to open its
presidential sites for weapons inspections. The United States and
Britain responded with threats of attacks until Iraq relented under
a deal with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
	   Butler is carrying a three-page list of obligations that he says
Iraq must fulfill. Among his key complaints and demands are:
	   _ UNSCOM needs information on long-range missile that Iraq
bought from other countries.
	   _ Iraq needs to prove it has scrapped all biological and
chemical warheads and missile fuel.
	   _ it must provide documentation on domestic production of
long-range missiles.
	   _ Iraq must prove that it dismantled unaccounted for chemical
munitions including 155mm mustard gas shells as well as chemical
and biological aerial bombs.
	   _ It must full account for its past activities in producing the
chemical agent VX.
	   No details of Butler's schedule during his five-day visit have
been released.
	   On Wednesday, Aziz, the deputy prime minister, accused Butler of
masterminding another ``political ploy'' to prolong sanctions on
Iraq.
	   He said the latest demands by Butler are designed to serve U.S.
and British interests. ``They want to destroy Iraq to (make it)
surrender, and they know Iraq will never do that,'' Aziz said in a
speech at a Christian conference in Baghdad.

Cambodia's Ranariddh urges commanders to forego amnesty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Ousted Cambodian Co-Prime Minister
Prince Norodom Ranariddh on Thursday urged his generals to drop
their demands for an amnesty so that his resistance forces and the
government could reach a peace agreement.
	   After Ranariddh was deposed by his co-premier Hun Sen in a coup
d'etat last July, the prince and two of his top military aides were
tried and convicted of plotting their own takeover.
	   Ranariddh was granted an amnesty, allowing him to return from
exile to contest a general election to be held in July.
	   But the amnesty was not extended to his generals, Nhek Bunchhay
and Serei Kosal, who lead a small resistance force of the prince's
loyalists in northern Cambodia.
	   The charges against Ranariddh and his generals were widely
considered to be politically motivated.
	   Peace talks between the government and the resistance broke off
Wednesday with both sides blaming each other for the deadlock.
	   Ranariddh on Thursday told his resistance commanders to shelve
their demand for amnesty and to move toward integration into the
government-controlled Royal Cambodian Armed Forces.
	   He said a permanent ceasefire, reintegration of resistance
soldiers into the army and the return of refugees to take part in
the July 26 elections took priority over the amnesty issue.
	   ``I'd like to say that we must put aside the issue of amnesty
for Gen. Nhek Bunchhay and Serei Kosal for a while,'' Ranariddh
told reporters after delivering a speech to about 1,000 supporters
at the headquarters of his FUNCINPEC party.
	   ``I think that the issue of integration must be settled first,''
he said. ``As the king has suggested, we solve these issues first
and we will be able to solve issue of amnesty afterward.''
	   Ranariddh is anxious to reintegrate his forces into the
government army because if he is judged to be in command of an
independent military force, he could be found ineligible to run in
the elections.
	   Gen. Dam Vuthy, chief negotiator for the Phnom Penh government,
on Wednesday had accused the resistance group of intentionally
stalling to buy time.
	   ``They put forth various conditions in a bid to delay or to
refuse to integrate into Royal Cambodia Armed Forces,'' Dam Vuthy
told reporters.
	   He warned that by sticking to their demands for having a joint
ceasefire signed and amnesty for their commanders, resistance
forces might not be able to integrate in time for July's elections.

Britain says NATO considering force in Kosovo within days
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With NATO-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ NATO is considering using military force in Kosovo
within days, British Defense Secretary George Robertson said
Thursday before joining other defense ministers meeting in
Brussels.
	   ``Days rather than weeks is the timetable because the lessons we
learned from Bosnia were that unless decisive action is taken early
on to stop the kind of violence we're seeing in Kosovo today, then
the situation simply becomes worse,'' Roberston said in a BBC radio
interview.
	   His remarks were the latest signal that Britain's Labor Party
government is pressing strongly for military intervention to stop
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's violent suppression of
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia.
	   In Parliament on Wednesday, Prime Minister Tony Blair said that
Milosevic will heed only a credible threat of military force and
the sole problem was drumming up support for this.
	   Robertson said he believed Milosevic realized that ``NATO means
business'' which was why there had been a fall in the violence in
the last 48 hours.
	   ``... What the NATO ministers collectively today are likely to
say is that is something that must continue,'' said Robertson.
``That the violence must stop, the political process must begin, or
else the military options that are available to us and which are
being worked on at this very minute, may well have to be put into
place.''
	   Saying military intervention was a last resort, Robertson added,
``If it requires military action or the use of some of the military
options to get him to see sense then that is after all what we are
here to do.''

NATO defense ministers look at possible military action on Kosovo

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The United States is signaling it wants
NATO to organize air exercises in Albania and Macedonia as defense
ministers meeting here Thursday consider military options to halt
ethnic carnage in Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, after a private meeting
with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, was conferring with his
15 NATO colleagues on possible steps the alliance could take.
	   A U.S. official traveling with Cohen said the defense ministers
were ``likely to endorse ... planning for air exercises in Albania
and Macedonia.'' The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
pointed to comments made Wednesday in Washington by White House
Press Secretary Mike McCurry.
	   McCurry said the goal was ``to clearly indicate that NATO will
define and project its interests in the Balkans in a way that
reminds the Belgrade authorities of how seriously we take the
violence that has occurred in Kosovo, directed against the Kosovar
Albanians.''
	   British Defense Minister George Robertson said NATO must make
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``think again'' about what he
is doing.
	   ``Air strikes are only one of the options that NATO ministers
will be considering,'' Robertson said as he arrived at NATO
headquarters. ``In Belgrade they have to know that the NATO
ministers here today are not ruling out any options at all.''
	   The ministers were expected to order military planners to take a
hard look at intervention options, such as sending in troops,
conducting air strikes or enforcing a no-fly zone over the troubled
province, where the Serb military is trying violently to quash an
independence movement by ethnic Albanians.
	   ``We have to plan for meaningful military measures,'' said
German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe. But he stressed that those
measures had to be ``parallel to the political process. This is not
an internal affair, it concerns stability and human rights in
Europe.''
	   Beyond possible air maneuvers over neighboring Albania and
Macedonia, the ministers also were debating moves to establish
military training and exercise centers and the use of NATO
transport to help cope with refugee flows.
	   Speaking in Rome prior to flying to Brussels, Cohen said he
hoped the West would not have to resort to military action, but he
left the option open.
	   ``It is important to end this scandal of the bombing and
shelling of innocent people. We will work to achieve that at every
level _ diplomatic, economic and hopefully not military _ but we're
not ruling it out either,'' Cohen said at a news conference with
Italian Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta.
	   For two weeks, NATO military planners have followed earlier
instructions to study indirect options for pressuring Milosevic.
Among the options are dispatching up to 20,000 troops to Albania
and Macedonia to reinforce the existing 750-man U.N. force in
Macedonia and help both countries secure their borders while
dealing with refugees and arms smugglers.
	   In Kosovo, more than 250 people have died in clashes between
government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of
the Albanian independence movement. Ethnic Albanians, who comprise
90 percent of the province's population, demand independence from
Serbia, dominant of Yugoslavia's two republics.
	   The United States and its allies support autonomy for Kosovo but
oppose demands for independence and condemn violence on both sides.

Ethiopia says fighting opens on third front
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopian and Eritrean forces
clashed Thursday along a third front near an important Red Sea
port, a government spokeswoman said.
	   Salome Tadesse said fighting also continued far inland in the
Yirga triangle region, the 400-square-kilometer (160-square-mile)
area where the clash between the neighboring countries broke out in
early May.
	   Eritrean forces attacked Ethiopian troops along the border in
the vicinity of the Eritrean port of Assab, said Salome. She could
not provide the exact location of the fighting nor the number of
casualties.
	   The Assab region is where landlocked Ethiopia's border comes
closest to the Red Sea, about 75 kilometers (45 miles) away. It is
the first time fighting has flared in this area. The port town is
650 kilometers (403 miles) northeast of Addis Ababa.
	   Until the current border dispute erupted into fighting, Ethiopia
exported most of its coffee _ its chief foreign currency earner _
through Assab. It now uses the port of Djibouti to the south on the
Gulf of Aden.
	   Salome also said fighting was continuing at the Badme-Shiraro
border front in the northwest. She did not mention any activity
around Zala Ambessa to the northeast. The Eritreans captured the
border town of 15,000 last week.
	   The fighting comes amid growing international efforts to prevent
the clashes from escalating into a full-scale war.
	   On Wednesday, the Organization of African Unity said a
delegation of African leaders would visit Ethiopia and Eritrea on a
peace mission. Eritrea, meanwhile, proposed that Egypt join the
United States and Rwanda in attempts at mediation.
	   The United States and Rwanda have put forth a four-point
proposal to stop the fighting and start talks. Ethiopia accepted,
but Eritrea demurred, claiming the plan, which suggests that
Eritrea withdraw to positions it held before the fighting broke out
May 6, needed more work.
	   Regional military sources say the plan calls for Rwanda to
supply the peacekeeping forces to enforce demilitarization of
disputed border regions.
	   Eritrean rebels fought Ethiopia for 30 years to gain
independence. They succeeded in 1993, two years after helping
Ethiopian rebels under Meles Zenawi _ who is now prime minister _
oust a 17-year military dictatorship.
	   The 53-nation OAU said its delegation will try to persuade both
parties to agree to a cease-fire and peace talks. Eritrean Foreign
Minister Haile Woldetensae welcomed the proposal and said his
country was willing to withdraw immediately from disputed
territory. There was no comment from his Ethiopian counterpart.
	   In Cairo, Eritrean officials said they wanted Egypt and possibly
other African nations to mediate the conflict as well.
	   But Egypt and Ethiopia do not always agree on issues in the Horn
of Africa. Egypt has been backing one set of faction leaders in an
attempt to secure peace and set up a national administration in
war-ravaged Somalia; Ethiopia backs their rivals.
	   Italy colonized Eritrea in 1885 but was defeated in its attempt
to conquer Ethiopia as well. Britain assumed control of Eritrea in
1941 and the territory was absorbed into Ethiopia in 1962.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 
 &UR; TURKS AND CAICOS: Police question survivors who claim officer shot
refugees &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COCKBURN TOWN, Turks and Caicos (AP) _ Police on Wednesday
questioned Haitian refugees who claim an officer shot at and hit
passengers on their overcrowded boat.
	   At least six people drowned when the vessel capsized after
Monday's shooting, just 15 miles (25 kilometers) from
Providenciales, the largest of the British Turks and Caicos
islands. A tourism boom there has attracted hundreds of Haitians to
work on resort construction sites and in hotels.
	   Some of the 75 survivors claim there were 113 people on the
boat, but police divers and other searchers found no more bodies or
survivors Wednesday, said Bryan Davies, deputy police commissioner
of the island chain between Cuba and the Bahamas.
 &UR; ST. MAARTEN: Residents call immigration accord racist
	   PHILIPSBURG, St. Maarten (AP) _ Hundreds of St. Maarten
residents are protesting what they call racist proposals to allow
Europeans to enter the island freely while requiring visas from
residents of other Caribbean islands.
	   About 700 of the Dutch territory's 34,000 residents sent a
petition Wednesday to the United Nations and the Caribbean
Community urging them to oppose a proposed immigration treaty
between the Netherlands and France. The two countries share the
island of St. Martin.
	   Currently, all foreigners must have visas to enter St. Maarten,
where the island's main airport is located.
	   Under the agreement, the 300 million residents of the European
Union's 15 member countries would be able to enter without visas.
 &UR; SURINAME: Business groups call for president to step down
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ As another wave of work stoppages
sweeps through Suriname, business groups are urging President Jules
Wijdenbosch to resign and allow economic experts to negotiate a
peace with labor unions.
	   Both the Suriname Business Association and the Association of
Manufacturers issued statements Wednesday suggesting that
Wijdenbosch appoint a ``National Crisis Cabinet'' of business
experts to help resolve strikes that have closed schools and stores
across the country for two days.
	   ``The present governing team has not proved able to implement
the presented government program'' of lowering debt and resolving
labor problems, the Association of Manufacturers said in its
statement.
	   Workers are protesting moves to privatize some operations of the
government-owned State Oil Co.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Governor signs hefty pay raise for lawmakers
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Despite a new poll suggesting that
most Puerto Ricans believe things are going badly on their
Caribbean island, the governor on Wednesday signed into law a
controversial 50 percent raise for legislators.
	   The move was a risky one for Gov. Pedro Rossello, who has
devoted his term to turning Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, into the
51st state. Another recent poll suggested that only about 40
percent of island residents support his cause.
	   Starting in 2000, lawmakers will earn dlrs 60,000 annually, in
addition to nearly dlrs 20,000 tax-free to cover daily expenses _
making them among the best-paid U.S. legislators. The leaders of
the house and senate will earn dlrs 90,000.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Residents glued to TVs for World Cup start
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Office employees carried televisions to
work and bank customers stood transfixed before sets in bank
lobbies as Jamaica turned its attention to the World Cup on
Wednesday.
	   Few telephones rang and traffic on Kingston's streets dropped
off as the first round of matches began Wednesday morning. Most
televisions were tuned to the face-off between Brazil, the
defending champion, and Scotland.
	   Interest in the World Cup on this Caribbean island has been
intense since Jamaica won its first-ever berth in the championship
playoffs.
	   It will be the first chance a Caribbean country has had at the
World Cup since Haiti played in 1974.
	   Prime Minister Percival J. Patterson announced he would leave
Thursday for France to attend tourism promotions tied to the team
and watch the Jamaicans play in their first match against Croatia
on June 14.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Nabisco buys cookie company
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ U.S. food giant Nabisco Inc. has bought
Butterkist Ltd., a Jamaican cookie-making company owned by the
Mechala Group, for dlrs 9.4 million (Jamaican dlrs 330 million).
	   As part of the deal, another Mechala company, Facey Commodity
Ltd., will become the sole distributor of Nabisco's non-snack
product lines in Jamaica.
	   The 190 employees of the 29-year-old Butterkist will be offered
30-day contracts while Nabisco considers staffing cuts.
	   Nabisco says it will make Jamaica its base for pushing products
in the the Caribbean. It now has regional sales of dlrs 75 million
and is hoping for dlrs 100 million with the acquisition of
Butterkist.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Government rejects request for phone rate increase
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica's commerce minister on
Wednesday rejected a request by Cable &AMP; Wireless Ltd., the only
telephone service provider on the island, to raise its rates 20
percent.
	   Phillip Paulwell, minister of commerce and technology, said he
turned down the request in a letter to Mayer Matalon, chairman of
the company's Jamaican branch.
	   Under Jamaican law, Cable &AMP; Wireless can hike rates only if its
profit margin falls below 17.5 percent. Paulwell said the
government estimates projected a bigger profit than that in 1998.
	   The proposed increase had been expected to yield an additional
dlrs 68.5 million (Jamaican dlrs 2.4 billion) annually in revenue
for the company.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Sugar production from six countries reaches 472,000 tons
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ The six member countries of Sugar
Association of the Caribbean together produced about 472,000 metric
tons (512,000 short tons) of sugar between November and May 31, the
group reported Wednesday.
	   Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, Belize, St. Kitts and Nevis,
Guyana and Jamaica exported about 253,000 metric tons (278,300
short tons) to Europe under treaty arrangements giving preference
to Caribbean sugar, and 35,400 metric tons (38,900 short tons)
under other arrangements, the group said.
	   Sugar exports to the United States totaled 31,000 metric tons
(34,000 short tons), and 13,800 metric tons (15,100 short tons)
went to other markets.
 &UR; U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS: Taiwanese consider importing Virgin Islands
sheep
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ A breed of sheep
from the U.S. Virgin Islands that tolerates tropical heat well may
soon find its way to Taiwan, officials said after a visit by
Taiwanese agriculture officials.
	   The visitors from Taiwan's Livestock Research Institute said
Tuesday they were impressed by the Virgin Islands white-haired
sheep, a breed that has no wool and is raised for its meat. They
expressed interest in raising them, said Jim Rakocy, a University
of the Virgin Islands researcher who accompanied the group.
	   The animals have already been exported to farms in Portugal, and
local agriculture officials are trying to interest South American
ranchers in the breed.

Prosecutors say guerrillas tried to recruit members before deadly
</HEADLINE>
clash &QL; 
 &UR; With Mexico-Chiapas &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Members of a guerrilla group have admitted
that they were trying to recruit local residents in the mountains
of southwestern Guerrero state when they were discovered by
soldiers, leading to a clash that killed 11 rebels, officials said.
	   But none of the would-be recruits were among those killed Sunday
in the hamlet of El Charco, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) west of
Acapulco, the attorney general's office said in a statement
Wednesday. All 11 were active members of the Popular Revolutionary
Army, known by its Spanish initials as the EPR, it said.
	   The clash at a schoolhouse in El Charco, was among the bloodiest
clashes since the EPR emerged in June 1996.
	   Among the 27 people arrested after the clash, two have admitted
being active members of the EPR and have given authorities
information about the group's operations, the statement said.
	   It said two EPR members, identified as Ericka Zamora Pardo and
Efren Cortez Chavez, told authorities they were holding a
recruitment meeting in the schoolhouse and planned to spend the
night in there. The EPR members stayed in one room and the local
residents in another.
	   Early that morning they were surprised by the shouts of soldiers
calling on them to surrender. Zamora Pardo said the guerrillas
tried to shoot their way out of the school, but were gunned down by
soldiers, the statement said.
	   However, Cortez Chavez told authorities the guerrillas wanted to
surrender, but had to respond to soldiers' gunfire, it said.
	   The attorney general's office said it expects to decide by
Thursday what charges to file in the case.
	   The EPR is one of two major guerrilla groups in Mexico. The
other, the Zapatista National Liberation Army, has been fighting in
southern Chiapas state in the name of Indian rights and greater
democracy.

Canadian foreign minister calls on President Clerides
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy
met with President Glafcos Clerides Thursday and backed U.N.
sponsored talks on reunification of the war-divided island, sources
said.
	   There was no official statement on their talks, but diplomatic
sources said the talks covered the political and security situation
in Cyprus.
	   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Axworthy
reiterated Canada's support for the U.N.-sponsored talks for the
reunification of Cyprus through the establishment of a bizonal
federation.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since 1974 when Turkey invaded the
island in the wake of an abortive coup by supporters of union with
Greece. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state established in the north
is only recognized by Ankara which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   Axworthy will cross the U.N.-buffer zone splitting the capital
and the rest of the island to confer with Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash before his departure for London later Thursday at the
end of his two-day visit.

Tokyo stocks tumble on weak yen and Asian jitters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices tumbled Thursday as investors
were scared away by the Japanese yen's continued weakness against
the dollar and falling markets across Asia.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 325.22 points, or 2.12
percent, closing at 15,014.04 points. On Wednesday, the Nikkei sank
190.91 points, or 1.23 percent.
	   Share prices fell on renewed worries about Asia's financial
turmoil and the recent sharp skid in the value of the yen, which
Thursday slid at one point to its lowest level against the dollar
in 7 1/2 years.
	   ``Investors are worried that banks' bad loan problems will
balloon if the financial crisis worsens (in Asia),'' said Naoki
Takahashi, manager at Marusan Securities.
	   Banking issues, which took a beating Wednesday, were again big
losers as investors feared that Japanese banks' problem loans
overseas will swell because of the weakening yen.
	   Small-lot buying from public pension funds in the afternoon
session managed to keep the Nikkei average above the 15,000-point
level, traders said.
	   Retreaters outnumbered advancers 858 to 248, with 152 issues
unchanged. An estimated 418 million shares changed hands on the
first section, up Wednesday's 353 million shares.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section shed 19.79 points, or 1.65 percent, to 1,178.81. The
TOPIX fell 10.08 points, or 0.83 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar bought 141.68 yen in late afternoon
trading, up 0.84 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above
its late New York rate of 141.43 yen overnight.
	   During Thursday's trading, the U.S. currency moved as high as
142.10 yen, its highest level in Tokyo since September 6, 1990,
when it reached 142.45 yen.
	   Traders said the dollar's rise was spurred by concerns about
financial turmoil in Asia, which led to safe-haven dollar-buying.
	   Interest in the dollar was also bolstered after Group of Seven
deputy finance ministers failed to make a firm committment to halt
the yen's slide after a meeting Wednesday in Paris.
	   Recent signs that Japan's economy is slowing, such as rising
unemployment and falling corporate profits, have also hurt the yen.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.245 percent from Wednesday's close of 1.195 percent,
driving its price down to 111.68 yen from 112.06 yen.

Philippines marks centennial of declaration of independence

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Filipinos celebrate Friday the
centennial of their country's declaration of independence from
Spain, the climax of Asia's first revolution against Western
colonial rule.
	   President Fidel Ramos hailed the Philippines' achievement of
relative peace and stability just 12 years after the ouster of the
late dictator Ferdinand Marcos and a decade after a series of coup
attempts.
	   ``Most important of all is that we reached our 100th year not in
a state of war, not in a state of massive insurgency, not with
coups happening all over the place,'' said Ramos, whose term ends
June 30.
	   More than 30 countries are sending representatives to the main
celebrations Friday at Manila's Rizal Park, named after national
hero Jose Rizal who was shot by the Spanish for advocating
equality.
	   The highlights of the festivities are a parade depicting the
country's struggle against 333 years of Spanish colonialism and a
massive fireworks display Friday night over Manila Bay.
	   Bay side hotels have been heavily booked by local and foreign
tourists for the celebration.
	   Leftist groups under the New Patriotic Alliance, however,
planned an ``alternative'' celebration with a protest parade to the
U.S. Embassy.
	   Leaders of the alliance said they are celebrating the demise of
Spain's colonial rule in 1898 but also highlighting the United
States' subsequent takeover of the Philippines, which they claim is
downplayed in the government-sponsored festivities.
	   The Philippine government, helped by private companies, is
spending at least 3.5 billion pesos (dlrs 92 million) on the
centennial celebrations, which also feature a trade and historical
exposition at the Clark Special Economic Zone, a former U.S. air
base in northern Pampanga province.
	   A third of the money is going to the renovation of 16 historic
shrines and the construction of historical markers and monuments
along the ``freedom trail,'' sites where Filipinos put up
resistance against Spain.
	   Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan was the first European to
land in the Philippines on a mission to search for spices for Spain
in 1521. The archipelago formally became a Spanish colony in 1565.
	   Sporadic local revolts challenged the Spanish colonial
administration. In 1892, Filipino nationalists established a secret
society called the Katipunan, which prepared for armed rebellion
against Spain.
	   The revolt erupted four years later and spread rapidly through
much of the country.
	   On June 12, 1898, revolutionary leader Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo
proclaimed independence from Spain in Kawit in Cavite province
south of Manila.
	   A month earlier the Spanish armada had been destroyed in Manila
Bay by U.S. naval forces under Commodore George Dewey, who was sent
to the Philippines following the outbreak of the Spanish-American
war a few months earlier.
	   Spain, still unwilling to hand over power to the Filipino
revolutionaries, ceded the country to the United States for dlrs 20
million in December 1898.
	   The following year, hostilities broke out between Filipino
revolutionaries and American forces sent to occupy the new U.S.
colony. The brief but brutal Philippine-American war is considered
by some historians as the ``first Vietnam'' of the United States.
	   The U.S. colonial administration was interrupted by Japanese
occupation during World War II.
	   The United States formally granted the Philippines independence
in 1946, but American influence remains strong.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's most influential newspaper urged the
government to stop cooperating with chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler who began a crucial disarmament mission Thursday.
	   The ``time has come to chop the tongue of this dog,'' the Babil
newspaper, owned by President Saddam Hussein's son, Odai, said.
	   It is also time Iraq halted ``courting this mad dog,'' said
Babil, repeating the insult that Iraqi newspaper have often used in
referring to Butler.
	   Babil said its remarks were in reaction to Butler's refusal to
accept Iraqi claim that it has no more information to give to the
United Nations on its illegal weapons programs and weapons.
	   Iraq says it has destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction,
as required by the U.N. Security Council, and that the U.N. must
now lift the economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
	   Butler, who heads the United Nations Special Commission, says he
needs more evidence from the Iraqis supporting their claims.
	   Butler arrived in Baghdad Thursday for talks with Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz aimed at eliciting that evidence. He did
not speak with reporters on arrival.
	   He is accompanied by 18 senior U.N. arms experts who are
carrying satellite images, charts and material evidence to back
UNSCOM's position that Iraq is also hiding information on illegal
weapons.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's exports rose 8.6 percent in the first
five months of the year to dlrs 71.11 billion, while imports
increased 1.5 percent to dlrs 52.58 billion, according to figures
released by the Chinese General Administration of Customs.
	   However, exports for the month of May slid 1.5 percent from a
year ago to dlrs 14.93 billion and imports fell 3.8 percent to dlrs
11.29 billion, resulting in a surplus of dlrs 3.64 billion for the
month, the Xinhua News Agency reported late Wednesday.
	   According to the government, China's export growth for the
period continued to be hurt by the Asian financial crisis, while
weak domestic demand also took a bite out of imports during the
month of May.
	   China's trade surplus reached dlrs 18.53 billion during the
January-to-May period. Total trade volume during the period grew
5.4 percent to dlrs 123.7 billion.
	   Exports to the United States in January to May rose 18.1
percent, and the United States displaced Hong Kong as China's
second largest trading partner, according to the report.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Machinery orders by private-sector Japanese
manufacturers fell 16.8 percent in April from the month before, the
government said Thursday.
	   The so-called core orders component of the data, which exclude
orders considered volatile such as from electric power companies,
totaled 878.72 billion yen (dlrs 6.23 billion) in April, the
Economic Planing Agency said.
	   The orders, adjusted for seasonal factors, are regarded as an
early indicator of corporate capital spending over the six-to-nine
month period ahead.
	   The data is just the latest reinforcing the view that Japan's
slumping economy remains far from recovery and could be heading
into a deflationary spiral.
	   On Wednesday, the Finance Ministry reported capital investment
by Japanese companies declined by 5.8 percent during the first
quarter of this year from the same period last year.
	   ___
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The number of Asian tourists to
Australia has dropped severely this year because of the region's
economic crisis, Australian tourism officials said Thursday.
	   The number of overseas visitors to Australia in 1998 is expected
to fall by around 8 percent from the previous year, according to
the latest figures from the Tourism Forecasting Council.
	   The number of Japanese tourists alone was forecast to fall by 10
percent this year, and the combined market for the rest of Asia by
29.4 percent, it said.
	   Separately, the Tourism Council of Australia said its figures
suggest visitor arrivals will not return to 1997 levels until 2000.
	   ``An eight percent drop in visitor arrivals means 345,000 less
tourists to Australia this year or around dlrs 812 million
(Australian dlrs 1.4 billion) in lost revenue,'' said Bruce Baird,
the council's managing director.
	   But Tourism Minister Andrew Thomson was more optimistic. He said
Australia's tourism would grow back in the long run, predicting a
5.4 percent increase in the number of foreign visitors next year.
	   ___
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A proposed alliance between airlines
Ansett Holdings Ltd., Air New Zealand Ltd., and Singapore Airlines
Ltd. was cleared by anti-trust body, the Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission said Thursday.
	   The commission said in a draft determination that it will
authorize the alliance for five years.
	   Ansett, equally owned by News Corp. and Air New Zealand Ltd.,
applied in December to the commission for approval of an agreement
with Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand on a range of services
including code-sharing and frequent flyer programs.
	   The commission said it found that the alliance will enhance the
partners' ability to compete, particularly against the established
alliance between Qantas Airways Ltd. and British Airways.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ British Telecommunications PLC said Thursday that
its joint venture in Japan with Marubeni Corp. has applied to the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications for a license that would
allow it to provide both domestic and international services in
Japan.
	   The joint venture, BT Communications Services, plans to launch
international voice, leased circuit, and card services targeted at
major corporations early next year. The company aims to rapidly
expand into services for smaller businesses and the mass market.
	   BT owns 70 percent of the joint venture, BT Communications
Services, with the remaining 30 percent owned by Marubeni.
	   Under another type of license, BT Network Information Service,
another BT unit in Japan, already offers international and domestic
frame relay, packet switching, corporate voice, and Internet
services.
	   ___
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's state-owned oil and gas
company Pertamina Thursday signed six oil-and gas production
sharing contracts with foreign companies amid dwindling interest
from foreigners to invest in Indonesia.
	   The minimum total value of the investment commitments is dlrs
318 million for the first ten years, said Pertamina's exploration
and production director Priyambodo Mulyosudirjo.
	   The six foreign companies are Japan Petroleum Exploration Co.,
which obtained the contract for Irian Jaya's onshore Semirak bloc;
YPF South Sokang Ltd. for the offshore South Sumatra Sokang bloc;
Lasmo (Malagot) Ltd., for Irian Jaya's offshore Malagot bloc;
Wirabuana Pan Resources Karapan Ltd. for East Java's offshore
Karapan bloc; Gulf Resources (Ketapang) Ltd. for East Java's
offshore Ketapang bloc; and Tatal Walo for Irian Jaya's offshore
Walo bloc.
	   Priyambodo said that the contracts are valid for 30 years, and
were approved by President B.J. Habibie.

Mayor of Ukrainian city arrested for alleged criminal links
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - A Ukrainian mayor has been detained for
alleged links with organized crime and is suspected of assisting a
gang that specialized in car theft, a newspaper said Thursday.
	   Prominent businessman Olexander Bushko became mayor of
Tsiurupynsk, about 600 kilometers (370 miles) south of Kiev, two
months ago. He was detained Wednesday by the regional police
organized crime department, Kievskiye Vedomosti said.
	   Bushko is suspected of serving as a middleman in negotiations
between the gang of car thieves and the stolen vehicles' owners,
the paper said. Car thieves in the former Soviet Union often sell
stolen cars back to their owners.
	   City residents were amazed by the arrest, since Bushko has been
active in forming municipal police units, to which he even donated
one of his own cars, Kievskiye Vedomosti said.

Calls mount for release of East Timorese rebel chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Pressure on Indonesia to free East
Timor's jailed rebel chief mounted Thursday, with the governor of
the Indonesian-controlled territory saying his release was key to a
peaceful solution.
	   Meanwhile, a dozen political prisoners whose freedom was granted
by the Indonesian government refused to leave an East Timorese
jail, saying they wanted guarantees that guerrilla leader Xanana
Gusmao would also be released.
	   Considered by many to be a figurehead of Indonesia's authority,
Gov. Abilio Osorio Soares appealed for the freedom of Gusmao, who
was arrested in 1992 and sentenced to 20 years in prison, as well
as other political prisoners from the former Portuguese colony.
	   ``It's not only Xanana but all the political prisoners who
should be released,'' he said in an interview in his office. ``Each
of them will play an important role in the solution to East
Timor.''
	   East Timor has been conflict-ridden since Indonesia forces
invaded in 1975 and all but wiped out separatist guerrillas in the
hilly, rugged territory. Human rights workers say tens of thousands
of people died, and resentment against Indonesia still runs deep.
	   Gusmao, head of the rebel band known as Fretilin, is beloved by
many East Timorese who see him as a symbol of their struggle
despite the diminished military effectiveness of his forces.
	   However, the government regards him as a violent criminal not a
poltical prisoner.
	   His case has attracted international attention, and last year
South African President Nelson Mandela visited Gusmao in prison
during a state visit to Indonesia and urged his release. The call
was not heeded by then-President Suharto.
	   Critics consider civilian, appointed authorities in East Timor
such as Soares to be pliant tools of Indonesian policy, but his
call for Xanana's release contrasted with Jakarta's silence on the
fate of the guerrilla leader.
	   Soares left Dili, the seaside capital of East Timor, for Jakarta
on Thursday and said he planned to meet Gusmao in the city's
Cipinang prison in the next few days to discuss the territory's
troubles.
	   New President B.J. Habibie has released some political
prisoners, including East Timorese, and is implementing democratic
reforms in the wake of the resignation last month of his
authoritarian predecessor, Suharto.
	   But Habibie is reluctant to yield to demands for a referendum on
independence in East Timor, offering instead special status that
might include some autonomy. He also did not include Gusmao in a
list of 15 East Timorese political prisoners whose freedom was
granted this week in a presidential decree.
	   The prisoners remained inside Becora jail in Dili late Thursday,
negotiating with a justice ministry official. They were reluctant
to leave without guarantees that Gusmao and other political
prisoners would also be released, a defense attorney said.
	   ``As long as Xanana and the others aren't freed, they're not
coming out,'' said human rights lawyer Aniceto Gutierres. The
prisoners are relatively minor figures who were arrested for
offenses such as demonstrating against Indonesian authority.

Southern China executes 10 for murder, other crimes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Authorities in the southern city of Guangzhou
have executed 10 people convicted of murder, armed robbery or drug
trafficking, according to a report seen Thursday in Beijing.
	   The 10 were executed shortly after a public sentencing rally
held Wednesday to demonstrate the government's resolve to ``strike
hard'' at crime, the state-run newspaper Yangcheng Evening News
reported.
	   The report said seven of the 10 were found guilty of murder, but
it did not provide any further details.

World Cup: Yugoslav star has extra motive to do well
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT GALMIER, France (AP) _ Predrag Mjatovic _ the Yugoslav
Ronaldo _ has an extra motive to do well at the World Cup.
	   ``I want to prove how much the world soccer has lost by banning
the Yugoslav team from the last World Cup and other international
competitions,'' Mijatovic said in an interview with the Associated
Press Thursday.
	   Economic and diplomatic sanctions imposed by the United Nations
against Yugoslavia in 1992 because of the wars in Bosnia and
Croatia also encompassed its athletes and teams. That led to the
country's national team being banned from qualifications for the
1994 World Cup in the United States.
	   Mijatovic, the 29-year-old high-scoring forward of Real Madrid,
says the ban hurt him the most as ``I have missed a chance to test
my skills on the top international level.''
	   ``Now I and my teammates have an extra motive to do well and
show how unfair the sanctions were,'' said Mijatovic, who is often
compared to Brazilian star Ronaldo.
	   Last season, Mijatovic was widely regarded as the second-best
player in Europe after Ronaldo. Many coaches predict that the two
will compete for the title of best player or scorer at the
championships in France.
	   ``I'm not thinking about Ronaldo. I'll concentrate more on
Taffarel if we ever get to play Brazil,'' Mijatovic said, referring
to the Brazilian goalkeeper.
	   Quick and cunning, Mijatovic was the best scorer in all World
Cup qualification groups with 14 goals. He netted seven in two
play-off matches against Hungary that ended 12-1 on aggregate in
Yugoslavia's favor.
	   Last month, Mijatovic snatched the only goal as Real Madrid beat
Juventus of Italy in the finals of European Champions' Cup.
	   At training sessions in this French village close to Saint
Etienne, Mijatovic seems to be the most motivated among his
teammates, running fast, changing direction and scoring at ease.
	   ``I feel fantastic,'' he said wiping sweat from his forehead.
``We all are ready for success because this is a great chance for
this generation of Yugoslav players.''
	   Yugoslavia and Germany are favored to qualify to the next round
of the World Cup from Group F that also includes the United States
and Iran.
	   ``I heard that the Americans are quite strong and they should be
taken seriously,'' Mijatovic said. ``Iranians play with fanatical
motivation, but we shouldn't have trouble beating them as the
quality is on our side.''
	   ``I'm not impressed by the Germans. I think they have an aging
team which is on the decline. Maybe this is our chance to beat
them,'' Mijatovic said.

Iraqi government urged to stop helping U.N. chief weapons
</HEADLINE>
inspector &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Will be led after Butler's arrival, scheduled for about 1000
GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's most influential newspaper urged the
government to stop cooperating with chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler who begins a crucial disarmament mission Thursday.
	   The ``time has come to chop the tongue of this dog,'' the Babil
newspaper, owned by President Saddam Hussein's son, Odai, said.
	   It is also time Iraq stopped ``courting this mad dog,'' said the
newspaper, repeating the insult that Iraqi newspapers have often
used in referring to Butler.
	   Babil said its remarks were in reaction to Butler's refusal to
accept Iraq's claim that it has no more information to give to the
United Nations on its illegal weapons programs.
	   Iraq says it has destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction,
as required by the U.N. Security Council, and that the United
Nations must respond by lifting the economic sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Butler, an Australian who heads the United Nations Special
Commission charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, says he needs more evidence from the Iraqis supporting
their claims.
	   Butler was due to arrive later Thursday for talks with Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz aimed at eliciting that evidence.
He will be accompanied by 18 senior U.N. arms experts who are
carrying satellite images, charts and material evidence to back
UNSCOM's position that Iraq is hiding information on illegal
weapons.
	   The Iraq-U.N. dispute has the potential for a crisis similar to
the one earlier this year when Iraq refused to open its
presidential sites for weapons inspections. The United States and
Britain responded with threats of military strikes until Iraq
relented under a deal with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
	   Butler is carrying a three-page list of obligations that he says
Iraq must fulfill. Among his key complaints and demands are:
	   _ UNSCOM needs information on long-range missiles that Iraq
bought from other countries.
	   _ Iraq needs to prove it has scrapped all biological and
chemical warheads and missile fuel.
	   _ Baghdad must provide documentation on domestic production of
long-range missiles.
	   _ Iraq must prove that it dismantled unaccounted for chemical
munitions, including 155mm mustard gas shells, as well as chemical
and biological aerial bombs.
	   _ It must fully account for its past activities in producing the
chemical agent VX.
	   No details of Butler's schedule during his five-day visit have
been released.
	   On Wednesday, Aziz accused Butler of masterminding another
``political ploy'' to prolong sanctions against Iraq.
	   He said the latest demands by Butler are designed to serve U.S.
and British interests. ``They want to destroy Iraq to (make it)
surrender, and they know Iraq will never do that,'' Aziz said in a
speech at a Christian conference in Baghdad.

Chinese and Japanese Communists end 31-year estrangement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The communist parties of Japan and China agreed
Thursday to let bygones be bygones and restore ties severed 31
years ago, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The two sides agreed that ``any issues left over from history
between the two parties have been resolved by and large'' and
agreed to normalize relations, the report said.
	   It indicated that the Chinese Communist Party, which cut its
ties with the Japanese Communists in 1967 when they refused to
accept the utopian dogma ordered by then-leader Mao Tse-tung, had
acknowledged mistakes.
	   ``The Japanese side expressed appreciation for the sincere
attitude of the Chinese side,'' it said.
	   The agreement, reached by the head of the Japanese Communist
Party's international department, Hikaru Nishiguchi, and his
Chinese counterpart, Dai Binggou, brings to an end an estrangement
left over from the Cold War era that had outlived any fundamental
differences between the two parties.
	   Increasingly isolated in Japanese politics, the Japanese
Communist Party is seeking to develop relations with kindred
communist parties elsewhere. The retirement last year of
89-year-old Kenji Miyamoto, who had served as Japanese Communist
Party chairman for almost 40 years, helped clear the way for a
rapprochement.
	   Early this year, the two groups resumed efforts to settle their
differences. Japanese Communist Party Chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa met
with Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao during Hu's visit to Japan in
April in the first contact between top officials of the two parties
in more than 30 years.
	   The Japanese Communist Party group now in Beijing is the first
such delegation to visit China since 1966.
	   An attempt to reach rapprochement failed in 1985 during talks in
Europe.
	   In an earlier sign of improved relations, the newspaper of the
Japanese Communist Party, the Akahata (Red Flag), reopened its
bureau in Beijing this year for the first time since 1967.
	   The agreement reached Thursday may be formalized during a visit
to China by Japanese Communist Party Chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The day after a dramatic stock and currency
dive, Singapore's key market indices recovered somewhat Thursday,
but further declines are expected as this Southeast Asian financial
service hub braces for a worsening regional economic crisis.
	   ``Singapore is extremely vulnerable to external developments, no
matter how well it runs its economy domestically, no matter how
prudent the government's fiscal policy,'' said Bruce Gale of the
Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy, Ltd.
	   ``Singaporeans are going to get a rude shock,'' Gale added.
	   Until now, this glittering island republic has been sheltered
from the turmoil that's hit other parts of the region. However, a
wave of tough economic news this week may signal the end of good
times for Singapore's 3.1 million people.
	   The key Straits Times Industrials Index dived 18.84 points, or
1.7 percent, within 15 minutes of opening Thursday, continuing
Wednesday's plunge to a 9 1/2 year low. But correction buying and
bargain hunting shifted the index up and down through the day and
it was up 13 points, or 1.2 percent, an hour before closing.
	   The Singapore dollar weakened further, briefly touching 1.75 to
the U.S. greenback before recovering to 1.7365 by late afternoon.
Currency traders expected it to follow the Asian trend downward.
	   ``A lot of the direction in the market hinges on the U.S.
dollar-Japanese yen direction,'' said Andy Tan, Singapore market
specialist for Standard and Poor's. ``And right now there is no
sign the Japanese yen would be able to recover. There has also been
disappointment that the G-7 failed to address the issue of the
Japanese yen weakness in a substantial way.''
	   Senior financial officials of the Group of Seven industrialized
states made no comment on the yen after their meeting in Paris
Wednesday.
	   ``These countries around Singapore are getting much worse than
what was initially expected,'' said Gale, the Singapore-based
economic consultant. ``Singapore is suffering as a consequence, and
only now is it just beginning to become apparent in the labor
market.''
	   Singaporeans _ used to decades of increased prosperity, annual
bonuses and nearly full employment _ won't be living on the streets
without enough food, even when things are at their worst. Because
of the small population, the government can control the
consequences.
	   Still, says Gale, ``people are going to be hit hard.''
Middle-level factory managers may end up working at fast-food
joints, and doing other menial jobs, such as construction work, now
performed almost entirely by foreigners.
	   While the weakening of the Singapore dollar has a benefit in
helping the island remain competitive among neighbors with devalued
currencies, the rapidly declining stock market and outflow of
foreign capital have already had negative effects:
	   _ People are delaying credit card payments more frequently,
despite the 24 percent rate in Singapore that once served as an
incentive for monthly payoffs.
	   _ Union leaders have predicted an all-time record number of
jobless this year, and told workers to expect ``wage restraint.''
	   _ Homeowners who bought condominiums or houses during a boom a
few years ago are facing ballooning mortgage payments at much
higher interest rates.
	   _ Banks are expected to announce low or negative profits in a
second straight year of writing off undisclosed bad regional loans.
	   _ The first big property development default has been announced,
and more are expected in a stagnant construction and tenancy
market.
	   _ Bankruptcies are rising.
	   ``I'm spending all my time closing my clients' businesses
down,'' said a prominent Singapore lawyer who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``It's good income for me now, but by next year I won't
have any clients.''

Iraqi government urged to stop helping U.N. arms chief

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's most influential newspaper urged the
government to stop cooperating with chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler who began a crucial disarmament mission Thursday.
	   The ``time has come to chop the tongue of this dog,'' the Babil
newspaper, owned by President Saddam Hussein's son, Odai, said.
	   It is also time Iraq halted ``courting this mad dog,'' said
Babil, repeating the insult that Iraqi newspaper have often used in
referring to Butler.
	   Babil said its remarks were in reaction to Butler's refusal to
accept Iraqi claim that it has no more information to give to the
United Nations on its illegal weapons programs and weapons.
	   Iraq says it has destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction,
as required by the U.N. Security Council, and that the U.N. must
now lift the economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
	   Butler, who heads the United Nations Special Commission, says he
needs more evidence from the Iraqis supporting their claims.
	   Butler arrived in Baghdad Thursday for talks with Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz aimed at eliciting that evidence.
	   ``I am very glad to be back and I am looking forward to our
talks ... I am very hopeful we will make some good progress,''
Butler told reporters. He did not elaborate.
	   Butler is accompanied by 18 senior U.N. arms experts who are
carrying satellite images, charts and material evidence to back
UNSCOM's position that Iraq is also hiding information on illegal
weapons.

Indonesian military to investigate claims that riots were organized
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Staffing

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie Thursday
ordered the military to investigate claims that systematically
provoked riots that killed almost 1,200 people last month.
	   The riots swept the capital and other parts of Indonesia and
helped force former President Suharto to quit after 32 years in
power.
	   After the trouble erupted, thousands of troops and dozens of
tanks went into the streets.
	   ``I ask the armed forces to disclose the truth about rumors that
at several locations, riots and looting was organized by certain
groups who incited many people to burn and to loot,'' Habibie said
during a meeting with military commander Gen. Wiranto.
	   Habibie did not say who might have been responsible. But he said
the armed forces must maintain discipline and take action against
any of its members who do not meet its high standards.
	   He called on soldiers to deal with protesters humanely and to
respect human rights.
	   Currently 18 police officers are facing charges in the shooting
deaths oif four student protesters on May 21. The slayings helped
spark the riots.
	   The newspaper Kompas quoted Amein Rais, a prominent Islamic
leader and opposition figure, as saying unknown people had
encouraged others to riot during May's political turmoil.
	   The target of much of the violence on may 13 and 14 were members
of the ethnic Chinese minority. They dominate commerce and industry
and have been made scapegoats for economic hard times.
	   The National Human Rights Commission has said that it has
received accounts from witnesses that say that organized groups
whipped up much of the violence.
	   Habibie, who replaced Suharto, has promised sweeping political
reform and new elections by the end of 1999.
	   However, many of Indonesia's 202 million people continue to
suffer from soaring inflation and mass unemployment resulting from
the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Many fear that violence could erupt again and the military has
begun taking precautions against the possibility of further unrest.
	   Kompas quoted Jakarta military commander Maj. Gen. Syafrie
Syamsuddin as saying he had ordered his forces to secure the safety
of the capital of about 10 million people.
	   He said 25,000 troops were now in Jakarta. However, there was
little evidence of a major military build up as the capital on what
appeared a normal business day.
	   At Parliament about 4,000 students staged a peaceful rally
demanding faster political change.
	   Wiranato has warned students not to act ilegally. During May,
thousands occupied the Parliament and in recent weeks protesters in
others cities have staged sit-ins at several provincial
legislatures.
	   Meanwhile authorities have filed serious charges against 250
people out of about 2,000 arrested during rioting that shook the
capital last month.
	   Police spokesman Edward Aritonang said the suspect had be
charged with looting, vandalism and arson.
	   Minor charges have been filed against another 400. About 700
people, who were arrested during the mayhem on May 13 and 14
disturbances, were later released after police established that
they were only bystanders.
	   Others, many of the young children, were released with no
charges filed.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The day after a dramatic stock and currency
dive, Singapore's key market indices recovered somewhat Thursday,
but further declines are expected as this Southeast Asian financial
service hub braces for a worsening regional economic crisis.
	   ``Singapore is extremely vulnerable to external developments, no
matter how well it runs its economy domestically, no matter how
prudent the government's fiscal policy,'' said Bruce Gale of the
Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy, Ltd.

	   The key Straits Times Industrials Index dived 18.84 points, or

Wednesday's plunge to a 9 1/2 year low. But correction buying and
bargain hunting shifted the index up and down through the day and

	   The Singapore dollar weakened further, briefly touching 1.75 to

Hong Kong shares plunge to new lows
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's stock market slump continued
Thursday as higher domestic interest rates further depressed
investor sentiment and sent the benchmark index to its third day of
consecutive losses.
	   Adding to Wednesday's 4.9-percent loss, the blue-chip Hang Seng
Index ended down 93.30 points, or 1.2 percent, at 7,886.07, the
lowest level since Feb. 1995.
	   The index has lost 8.16 percent during the last three days.
	   Turnover fell to 6.75 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 865
million), compared with Wednesday's 7.15 billion Hong Kong dollars
(dlrs 917 million).
	   The market opened in a panic on higher interbank interest rates
and the continued weakness of the Japanese yen.
	   The Hang Seng Index plunged 3.1 percent in the morning, but
bargain hunting and share buybacks helped erase some of the earlier
losses in the afternoon, traders said.
	   An early announcement issued by the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority, Hong Kong's de facto central bank, that banking system
liquidity will be tightened by a capital outflow to the tune of
4.12 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 528 million) triggered a
substantial increase in interbank rates.
	   The announcement sent the benchmark three-month rate to a high
of 14 percent.
	   ``The early morning selling was mainly a combination of the weak
yen and the higher interbank rates,'' said Patrick Yiu, research
analyst at Dharmala Securities Co.
	   Many blue chips hit new lows for the year in the morning before
rebounding slightly in the afternoon.
	   All sectors posted losses, except the traditional defensive
utilities stocks and the China-backed H-share index, which has
already fallen sharply on the prevailing fear of a yuan
devaluation.
	   Hong Kong Telecom gained 30 Hong Kong cents to 13.90, Hong Kong
Electric gained 90 cents to 22.30, and China Light gained 40 cents
to 32.40.
	   Shares of the London-based banking giant HSBC Holdings PLC
shares, which held firm in the last few days, finally succumbed to
the market's bearishness, closing down 4.0 to 177.0.
	   Among property shares, Cheung Kong Holdings lost 1.20 to 32.60,
and Sun Hung Kai Properties lost 20 cents to 30.10.

Japan's opposition submits motion against Hashimoto Cabinet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's biggest opposition party and two other
parties submitted a joint motion Thursday for a vote of
no-confidence against Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's Cabinet,
officials said.
	   The move was not expected to succeed in toppling Hashimoto from
power because his conservative Liberal Democratic Party dominates
both houses of Parliament. Most view it as a symbolic gesture ahead
of upper house elections which will likely be held on July 12.
	   Japan's Democratic Party, the lead opposition force in
parliament, took the lead in sponsoring the no-confidence motion to
protest the government's failure to jump start a moribund economy,
said a spokesman for the party, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The Democrats were joined by the Japanese Communist Party and
the Liberal Party in endorsing the motion submitted to Parliament's
more powerful lower house, the spokesman said. The vote is expected
Friday.
	   But opposition efforts to unnerve Hashimoto's ruling party
suffered a setback Wednesday when a non-aligned bloc of lawmakers
affiliated with a powerful Buddhist group signaled only lukewarm
support for a no-confidence motion, Japanese newspapers reported.
	   Hashimoto survived the first no-confidence vote against his
Cabinet last December. The 500-member lower house rejected the
no-confidence motion by a 268-219 margin.

	   YSSINGEAUX, France (AP) - As a Frenchman proud of his country's
reputation for good food, chef Alain Sagnol was a bit perturbed
when he learned that Iran's World Cup team was bringing its own
cook to France.
	   So when the Iranians arrived, Sagnol found the freshest salmon
in the market, cooked it in his own secret recipe, and served it
for dinner. The Iranians were hooked.
	   ``We go with French food these days,'' said coach Jalal Talebi,
adding that Sagnol's salmon delight was superb. ``Everyone liked
it. We eat Iranian food only every three or four days now,'' he
said.
	   But the Iranians, housed under tight security at a famous pastry
school in this pleasant town of 7,000 in the heart of France, won't
be tasting the region's most famous delicacy: Le petit sale aux
lentilles, or small sausages with lentils cooked in a delicate wine
sauce.
	   That's because their Muslim religion forbids the consumption of
pork or alcohol, so they will also miss out on the excellent cured
meats from the mountains and the famed liquor of Velay.
	   Except for fish, all other meat for the Iranians is slaughtered
in the special Muslim fashion and sent over by the Iranian Embassy
in Paris.
	   Before the Iranians arrived, the women staff at the pastry
school with the grand name of Ecole Nationale Superieure de la
Patisserie, were sent away on leave at the embassy's request.
	   ``The Iranians like French food a lot, and I am very pleased,''
said Sagnol, head chef at the school.
	   He said he has been tempting them with lots of salads, and
chicken and lamb dishes, even though their restrictions had
somewhat cramped his style.
	   ``Our cooking is a lot more complicated, while the Iranians have
a lot of simple grills,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Flight attendants and ground crew of
troubled Philippine Airlines threatened Thursday to join a strike
by about 600 pilots if the company institutes layoffs in a move to
cut costs.
	   ``We are going all the way with the pilots,'' said Roberto
Anduiza, president of the 2,100-strong Flight Attendants and
Stewardesses Association of the Philippines.
	   Anduiza said some members of the union would join the striking
pilots in a picket line later Thursday.
	   Gerry Rivera, vice president of the PAL Employees Association,
which represents ground crew and sales personnel, said members of
his union will also join the picket in a ``show of support,'' short
of an actual strike.
	   Rivera said they will declare their own strike if the company
attempts to reduce the work force or slash salaries.
	   On Wednesday, the financially beleaguered airline announced it
will no longer accept back the striking pilots and will sharply
reduce its operations to match the few pilots it still has.
	   It earlier announced plans to cut staff, slash costs and reduce
flights to survive its long-term financial problems.
	   PAL also said it will sell some of its 54 aircraft, including
some recently purchased.
	   In a statement Thursday, the airline said it would resume
regular but limited flights to 14 domestic cities and Tokyo,
Singapore, Hong Kong and San Francisco beginning Friday, the
centennial of Philippine independence from over 300 years of
Spanish colonialism.
	   Before the 620-strong Airline Pilots Association of the
Philippines went on strike last Friday, the airline flew 160 daily
domestic flights to 39 points and served 30 overseas cities in 17
countries.
	   The pilots are protesting a management policy of ordering pilots
to retire who have reached 20 years of service or flown 20,000
hours, regardless of age. The policy puts 225 pilots in danger of
forced retirement, said Capt. Sotico Lloren, president of the
pilots' union.
	   PAL, however, said it was not a unilateral management policy but
a provision in a collective bargaining agreement signed by airline
and union officials.
	   PAL said the strike has cost it about 150 million pesos (dlrs
3.8 million) a day in lost revenue. It said it lost 8 billion pesos
(dlrs 205 million) in the last fiscal year _ three times more than
the previous year.
	   President Fidel Ramos said the government, which owns a minority
stake in PAL, was concerned with the damage to the airline caused
by the dispute, which he described as ``big, bloody and costly.''
	   Ramos ordered labor officials to find ways of ending the
dispute. Labor Department officials, along with airline and union
representatives, met again Thursday afternoon in another attempt to
arrive at a settlement.
	   Lloren said the pilots have offered to return to work on
condition there will be no retaliatory actions against strikers and
the airline will pledge in writing to suspend the retirement plan
until a court has ruled on the issue or a new agreement with the
union is reached on the matter.
	   A PAL representative rejected the offer Wednesday and said the
airline considered all strikers terminated since they failed to
comply with a government back-to-work order on Tuesday.

Truth body grants amnesty for church massacre
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Three men who carried out an
infamous massacre at a mostly white church in 1993 received amnesty
Thursday from a panel probing apartheid-era crimes.
	   Eleven people died in the grenade and machine gun attack,
including three Russian seamen attending the service during a port
call.
	   The assault that also wounded 58 people came during delicate
negotiations between white and black parties to end apartheid, and
a year before South Africa's first all-race elections
	   The amnesty recipients _ Gcinikhaya Makoma, Bassie Mkhumbuzi and
Tobela Mlambisi _ were members of the armed wing of the
Pan-Africanist Congress, a radical black group that targeted
civilians in its fight against white rule.
	   On July 25, 1993, the three men attacked St. James Church of
England in a mostly white neighborhood of Cape Town, lobbing
grenades and spraying worshippers with machine guns.
	   The attack sent shock waves through South Africa, especially its
white population fearful of its fate under the likelihood of black
rule.
	   Charged with probing atrocities by all sides in the struggle
against apartheid, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission can
grant amnesty to people who tell the full truth about their actions
and prove a political motive.
	   In granting amnesty to the three, the commission concluded they
had made a full disclosure about the killings and been influenced
by the PAC slogan of ``one settler, one bullet'' which incited
black activists to kill whites.
	   About 260 PAC fighters have applied for amnesty from the
commission, but on Wednesday the panel warned that 132 of the
applications could be declared invalid because applicants had not
fully detailed their actions -- or in some cases even revealed
their identities.
	   The commission, which was set up President Nelson Mandela in
1995 to promote racial healing, has set a deadline of the end of
the week for the PAC to provide more information.

Senior Thai official calls for international action on yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo HK104

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A senior Thai official warned Thursday that a
further fall in the Japanese yen would spark another round of Asian
financil turmoil and a worldwide depression.
	   Speaking at a conference on Asia's financial crisis, Thailand's
Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said the latest
weakness of the yen is particularly alarming because it risks a
repetition of the first crisis, though on a larger scale.
	   The first crisis took place without Japan, he said. If the yen
is allowed to continue to fall the next crisis will be even ``more
serious than the last one,'' he warned. It ``would pull the rest of
the world with it,'' he said.
	   Supachai said major international powers must work to ensure
``Asia doesn't slide into a second Asian crisis ... because a
second crisis in Asia will become the first worldwide crisis.''
	   Fears of a new round of Asian financial turmoil sent the U.S.
dollar to a new seven-year high of 141.86 yen in intraday trading
Thursday, after finance officials of the Group of Seven
industralized nations failed to declare support for the Japanese
currency after a meeting in Paris late Wednesday.
	   But the dollar later fell back to 141.73 yen in late trading.
	   Supachai said the rest of Asia can't afford to compete with
Japan for export markets if the yen continues to plummet. A weak
yen ``will also mean we won't have the increasing demand'' from
Japan, which is necessary for the region to recover, he said.
	   If the yen is allowed to continue to fall, the Thai baht is sure
to weaken further, Supachai said, though he said it won't fall as
far as it did in January when the U.S. dollar hit 58 baht.
	   ``I hope it wouldn't go back to 58 baht,'' he said. Thursday
afternoon, the dollar was trading around 43.00 baht.
	   Supachai also called on Japan to offer special concessions to
erase its enormous trade gap and help speed up Asia's recovery and
enhance expternal demand to help ``the crisis-stricken countries.''
	   Supachai also said special funds should be created to help
staunch the flow of funds out of Asia.
	   Funds should be recycled back to Asia, he said. U.S. and
European economies will eventually be hit by the huge flow of funds
out of Asia, he added.

Indonesian military to investigate claims that riots were organized

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie Thursday
ordered the military to investigate claims that organized groups
systematically provoked riots that killed almost 1,200 people last
month.
	   The riots swept the capital and other parts of Indonesia and
helped force former President Suharto to quit after 32 years in
power.
	   After the trouble erupted, thousands of troops and dozens of
tanks went into the streets.
	   ``I ask the armed forces to disclose the truth about rumors that
at several locations, riots and looting was organized by certain
groups who incited many people to burn and to loot,'' Habibie said
during a meeting with military commander Gen. Wiranto.
	   Habibie did not say who might have been responsible. But he said
the armed forces must maintain discipline and take action against
any of its members who do not meet its high standards.
	   He called on soldiers to deal with protesters humanely and to
respect human rights.
	   Currently 18 police officers are facing charges in the shooting
deaths oif four student protesters on May 21. The slayings helped
spark the riots.
	   The newspaper Kompas quoted Amein Rais, a prominent Islamic
leader and opposition figure, as saying unknown people had
encouraged others to riot during May's political turmoil.
	   The target of much of the violence on may 13 and 14 were members
of the ethnic Chinese minority. They dominate commerce and industry
and have been made scapegoats for economic hard times.
	   The National Human Rights Commission has said that it has
received accounts from witnesses that say that organized groups
whipped up much of the violence.
	   Habibie, who replaced Suharto, has promised sweeping political
reform and new elections by the end of 1999.
	   However, many of Indonesia's 202 million people continue to
suffer from soaring inflation and mass unemployment resulting from
the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Many fear that violence could erupt again and the military has
begun taking precautions against the possibility of further unrest.
	   Kompas quoted Jakarta military commander Maj. Gen. Syafrie
Syamsuddin as saying he had ordered his forces to secure the safety
of the capital of about 10 million people.
	   He said 25,000 troops were now in Jakarta. However, there was
little evidence of a major military build up as the capital on what
appeared a normal business day.
	   At Parliament about 4,000 students staged a peaceful rally
demanding faster political change.
	   Wiranato has warned students not to act ilegally. During May,
thousands occupied the Parliament and in recent weeks protesters in
others cities have staged sit-ins at several provincial
legislatures.
	   Meanwhile authorities have filed serious charges against 250
people out of about 2,000 arrested during rioting that shook the
capital last month.
	   Police spokesman Edward Aritonang said the suspect had be
charged with looting, vandalism and arson.
	   Minor charges have been filed against another 400. About 700
people, who were arrested during the mayhem on May 13 and 14
disturbances, were later released after police established that
they were only bystanders.
	   Others, many of the young children, were released with no
charges filed.

Government closes schools a week early to avoid strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Plagued by teachers' strikes, the
government on Thursday announced it was closing all schools a week
early to avoid more disruption from walkouts and work stoppages.
	   Teachers staged nationwide strikes May 20 and June 4 to push
demands for higher wages, and after more futile negotiations
Wednesday threatened to go on all-out strike for the rest of this
week and next.
	   The government thus chose to end the school year Friday, a week
early.
	   Education Minister Bozidar Pugelnik said that would end ``this
circus'' of unsuccessful negotiation between teachers' unions and
his ministry.
	   Teachers' average salary is equivalent to dlrs 360 a month _
below the national average of dlrs 400 a month. They seek a 12
percent hike, and a holiday bonus equivalent to dlrs 370.
	   ``The time has come to put an end to the unrealistic union
demands,'' Zagreb's Radio 101 quoted Pugelnik as saying.
	   There was no immediate response from the teachers' unions.
	   The government says it has no money for a wage hike, but
teachers' unions insist education deserves more than its eight
percent allotment from the dlrs 6.4 billion 1998 state budget.
	   Social discontent is on the rise across Croatia as ordinary
people struggle to stretch their wages from month to month, while a
new elite grows richer, its wealth widely rumored to be built on
political connections and corruption.

Thousands of student protest outside of Indonesia's Parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos
 &UR; Eds: ADDS call for Suharto investigation in final grafs
 &UR; By IRWAN FIRDAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 4,000 university students
protested outside the Parliament Thursday demanding faster
democratic change and lower food prices.
	   Dozens of buses carrying students from several Jakarta campuses
arrived at the legislature.
	   Small groups of police and military personnel watched over the
peaceful rally outside the Parliament's iron gates.
	   Student organizers said they wanted what they described as a
``people's committee'' to be set up to act as a new Parliament
ahead of general elections to be held as soon as possible.
	   They also wanted the government to lower food prices and for
ex-President Suharto to be put on trial for corruption.
	   Demonstrations by students were a key factor in the push that
led to the resignation last month of Suharto, who had ruled for 32
years.
	   At the height of May's political turmoil more than 10,000
occupied the Parliament building for almost a week.
	   They left after Suharto stepped aside and was replaced as head
of state by his deputy and longtime friend B.J. Habibie who has
outlined a timetable for political reform between now and the end
of 1999.
	   However, Thursday's protest indicated that there is
dissatisfaction with the pace of change.
	   There is also resentment over rising inflation and mass
unemployment from the worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Critics of Suharto allege that he and his family amassed
billions of dollars and built huge business empires during his time
in office.
	   A group consisting of a prominent economist, corporate lawyers
and a retired Supreme Court judge said Thursday the government
should launch a specific investigation into Suharto's wealth and
take him to court for any wrongdoing.
	   The ``Indonesian Corruption Watch'' group said this would
demonstrate to foreign investors that Indonesia was serious about
clean government.
	   Habibie has ordered an a broad investigation into state
corruption under Suharto's rule. However, the inquiry does not
specifically target the ex-president or his children.
	   Habibie has also said any action against corruption must be
carried out according to the law.

Philippine stocks, peso fall sharply on weak yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing lower

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks and the peso
plunged Thursday on concerns over the continued weakening of the
Japanese yen and other Asian currencies, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index dropped 88.85
points, or 4.6 percent, to 1,829.02, its lowest level since
January, according to preliminary data.
	   The index fell 6.62 points, or 0.3 percent, on Wednesday and has
now lost 128.74 points over the past four sessions.
	   ``The region's problems are now taking their toll on us. We've
long pretended to be stronger than the rest, so now we're just
catching up with the rest of the region's losses,'' said Ian Kane,
trader for Anscor-Hagedorn Securities Inc.
	   Blue-chip stocks suffered the biggest losses Thursday. Among
them, Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. fell nearly 2 percent
and power distributor Manila Electric Co.'s B shares fell 4.4
percent.
	   The recent weakening of the yen has intensified fears the region
may be in for another round of currency devaluations.
	   The peso extended its recent losses, averaging 40.319 pesos per
dollar for the day compared to 39.775 pesos on Wednesday. It
touched a high of 40.470 pesos.
	   The absence of yen-supportive comments at a meeting of finance
officials from the Group of Seven industrialized nations, which
closed in Paris on Wednesday, also pressured regional currencies.
	   A further weakening of major Asian currencies in the near term
could raise the value of the dollar to as high as 45 pesos by the
end of June, Kane said.
	   He said the yen's decline could also further undermine Asian
economies.
	   ``Historically, Asian economies have tracked the strength of the
yen,'' he said.
	   Fears of a possible devaluation of China's yuan and the Hong
Kong dollar have also led to more selldowns in regional stock
markets, he said.
	   Joy Quintos, research head of Capital One Securities Inc., said
the Philippine stock market may continue to weaken unless the
volatility of regional currencies eases.
	   ``We will be looking at regional currencies for direction,'' she
said.
	   Markets will be closed Friday for a national holiday to
celebrate the centennial of the Philippines' declaration of
independence from Spanish colonial rule.

Honda to make more cars in Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Japanese automaker Honda said Thursday it will
invest 450 million pounds (dlrs 733 million) to increase production
at its British factory, including the rollout of a small new car
for the European market.
	   Honda hopes to increase its output at the plant in Swindon,
England, to 250,000 autos yearly by 2002 from the current 150,000
cars.
	   The deal will create 1,000 new jobs. British Trade Secretary
Margaret Beckett called it ``a massive vote of confidence in
Britain as a center for car production.''
	   Honda said it will develop a new range of its Civic models and
that a new small car, designed for the European market, should
enter production by 2002.
	   ``This expansion underlines our commitment to a `globalization
through localization' philosophy,'' said Honda's president,
Nobuhiko Kawamoto. ``This is the foundation of our development as
an important participant in the world's car industry.''
	   Honda is now building three models in Swindon: the Civic
five-door, the Civic Aero Deck and the Accord four-door. The
Accords are set to begin rolling off the assembly line in July and
will go on sale in October.
	   Part of Honda's investment announced Thursday will make its
engine production more efficient, the company said.

Economic downturn hampering Thailand's ability to help refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's economic crisis has hampered
its ability to help refugees flooding in from neighboring
countries, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday.
	   Nearly 200,000 refugees who have fled fighting in Myanmar,
Cambodia and Laos have taken shelter inside Thailand's borders
during the last several years.
	   Added to two million Thais unemployed because of the economic
downturn and over 800,000 illegal foreign workers, the refugees
have created a burden for the country, said Kobsak Chutikul, the
ministry spokesman.
	   The government has no plans, however, to change its refugee
policies or cut back services to refugee camps despite their drain
on shrinking government resources, he said.
	   Thailand is suffering through its worst economic crisis in
modern times. The economy is expected to contract by about 5.5
percent this year. The country is receiving a dlrs 17.2 billion
bailout supervised by the International Monetary Fund.
	   Also on Thursday, the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees said 17 countries participating in the third meeting of
the Asia-Pacific Consultations on Regional Approaches to Refugees
and Displaced Persons, concluded more regional cooperation was
necessary to tackle refugee and migration problems.
	   Participants at the conference, which ended Wednesday and was
hosted by the U.N. and the Thai government, agreed that the group
would establish a permanent secretariat in Bangkok.
	   They also resolved to meet annually.
	   The UNHCR will also soon become a ``copartner'' in administering
camps housing refugees from Myanmar in Thailand, a senior
government official was quoted as saying in Thursday's The Nation
newspaper.
	   Thailand has been accused of keeping some camps closed to
outsiders and reports have occasionally emerged of refugees being
abused. Some refugees have requested a UNHCR presence in the camps.
	   The camps have also been attacked frequently by rebel groups
inside Myanmar allied to that country's military government.
	   UNHCR officials told The Associated Press on Thursday that they
had met with senior government officials and were hopeful of
receiving approval soon to have a higher presence in the camps.
	   They said their meetings with Thai government officials had been
positive and they were looking forward to closer cooperation in the
future.

World Cup: Moroccan fans amazed by 2-2 draw with Norway
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TAREK EL-TABLAWY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Moroccan team coach Henri Michel may
have ``some regrets'' regarding the match against Norway, but
Moroccan fans are exhilarated that the team managed not only to
stave off a powerful adversary, but also control a large part of
the match, which ended 2-2.
	   ``Honestly, I didn't except anything quite like what I saw. I
thought the Atlas Lions would squeak, but they roared,'' said fan
Ezzedine Moustafa, 26, visibly excited and sipping a cup of coffee
at a downtown cafe Thursday morning while watching some fans
continue their celebrations.
	   In their match against powerhouse Norway Wednesday, underdog
Morocco came back from a sluggish start to control much of the game
through skillful short plays and a keeping the ball low and away
from the physically stronger Norwegian squad.
	   Emerging as the star for the Moroccans was El-Moustafa Hadji, a
midfielder who plays for Spain's Deportivo La Coruna. Hadji gave
the team its first goal in the 38th minute, took 3 powerful shots
on goal, barely missing with two of them.
	   Hadji's speed and deft play was ``a wonder sent down from God
himself,'' said fan Moustafa. ``I am confident that he will rise to
the top in this competition and will be the one who allows the team
to move into the second round.''
	   But power plays were not the only thing that Morocco displayed
against Norway. Inconsistencies in following through with the game
strategy made the team give away what team captain Nourredine
Naybet described as ``two stupid goals.''
	   Minutes after Hadji brought home the first goal, FC Porto's
Youssef Chippo saw the ball glance off his head and give Norway an
equalizer. Another confused play in the second half gave Norway its
second, and the final goal of the match.
	   Team coach Henri Michel said that the team had a tactical game
plan which the team essentially stuck to, but that they ``didn't
have time to get into position when we gave away the second goal.''
	   ``I still have some regrets concerning the match itself,'' said
Michel.
	   This was not the first time that Morocco has failed to move
ahead because of mistakes. In the World Cup qualifiers against
Ghana, Morocco led 2-0, but player errors allowed the Ghanaians to
catch up and tie the match. Similarly, in the African Nations Cup
qualifiers against Egypt in 1997, Morocco took an early 1-0 lead,
but was scored on almost immediately. The match also ended 2-2.
	   Errors aside, Morocco showed that it has ``what it takes to hold
its own _ if not necessarily win against Brazil,'' said Magd
bin-Youssef, a 32-year-old Moroccan fan, who plans to now make the
trip to the team's training camp in Aix-en-Provence in the hopes of
seeing more ``world-class football.''

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France is beginning the tough job of winning
back customers and erasing losses from a pilots' strike that lasted
until the World Cup's opening day.
	   On Thursday, a day after the surprise agreement, the carrier
planned 40-50 percent of its flights, and said it would return to
normal by the weekend.
	   The longest routes, including Hong Kong, Manila and
Johannesburg, were to be the last flights restored.
	   Jean-Cyril Spinetta, president of Air France, called the
agreement _ reached in secret overnight talks and announced
Wednesday _ a good compromise. The main pilots' union finally
accepted the company's offer of stock in exchange for pay.
	   But Spinetta said the strike had ``heavy'' consequences, costing
the company a billion francs (dlrs 166 million.)
	   ``Now we have to think of confidence, confidence in Air
France,'' he said.
	   It could have been worse, said Transport Minister Jean-Claude
Gayssot. Air France's very future ``would have been put in grave
danger by the continuation of this conflict,'' he said.
	   Gayssot said an agreement was almost reached during marathon
talks last Friday, on the strike's fifth day. But he said the deal
collapsed at the last minute.
	   Three smaller unions still on strike were to meet Thursday to
decide whether to continue.
	   In concessions to the pilots, the carrier said it would scrap a
two-tier salary scale, under which new pilots earned less than
their colleagues. The highly paid pilots felt that that system
undermined cockpit solidarity.
	   The pilots had been protesting 500 million francs (dlrs 83
million) in proposed salary cuts. Air France had said the cuts were
needed to provide capital to modernize the airline, which was saved
from bankruptcy in 1993 but reported profits in 1996 and 1997.
	   Air France said part of the agreement involved guaranteed
training for young pilots, at least part of which would be paid for
by the company.
	   The salary-for-shares swap is voluntary, and will last seven
years. Pilots who decline the offer will have a seven-year salary
cap.
	   As well as the airline strike, France has been hit in recent
days by walkouts by train drivers, baggage handlers, and some bus
services. There were no major walkouts Wednesday or Thursday.
	   In Bordeaux, where the Italy-Chile game was to be played
Thursday, a strike call by bus workers was canceled after a deal
was reached.
	   But around the city of Lyon, cars were being let through tolls
for just one franc (16 cents), a saving of about 100 francs, as
tollbooth workers demanded higher salaries.

Myanmar opens course on protecting women against violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's Social Welfare Ministry has
opened the country's first course on protecting women against
violence, a government statement said Thursday.
	   The three-day course, which ends Thursday, will instruct an
undisclosed number of ministry workers on how to collect data
relating to violence against women.
	   ``Compared with other countries, no major problem has arisen in
Myanmar as yet,'' said the statement, regarding abuse of women.
``However, it is necessary to be able to confront the problem if it
occurs in the future.''
	   Several human rights groups have condemned Myanmar's military
government for its treatment of women, particularly those belonging
to ethnic minorities.
	   Minority women are frequently forced to work as porters,
carrying food and ammunition for soldiers, and as human mine
sweepers.
	   Reports of gang rapes by Myanmar soldiers against minority
women, and against Burmese women student protesters during the
nationwide democracy uprising of 1988, are commonplace.
	   The military crushed the uprising by gunning down more than
3,000 unarmed protesters.

Israel demolishes Hebron family's house for third time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops Thursday bulldozed a
Palestinian home already rebuilt twice by the family after earlier
demolitions.
	   Soldiers scuffled with members of the Atrash family and their
neighbors, who threw stones and bottles.
	   Israeli peace activists had helped rebuild the house in the West
Bank town of Hebron in March after it was razed on grounds that it
was built without a permit. It was torn down in 1988 for the same
reason.
	   The house is near an Israeli bypass road that is intended to
allow Jewish settlers and other Israelis to travel through the West
Bank without entering Palestinian towns. Ten people lived in the
house.
	   Zahour Atrash, 38, shouted for help while the house was being
torn down, and vowed: ``We will take revenge.''
	   ``I will raise all my children to become Hamas extremists,'' she
said.
	   The Palestinians say Israel refuses to issue building permits in
areas of the West Bank it wants to keep under its control. Israel
says demolitions are legitimate means of enforcing zoning
regulations.
	   Mrs. Atrash said the family will rebuild.

Iraqi government urged to stop helping U.N. chief weapons
</HEADLINE>
inspector &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Butler's arrival, quote. Will be led with Butler
news conference, scheduled to begin at 1300 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's most influential newspaper urged the
government to stop cooperating with chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler who began a crucial disarmament mission Thursday.
	   The ``time has come to chop the tongue of this dog,'' the Babil
newspaper, owned by President Saddam Hussein's son, Odai, said.
	   It is also time Iraq stopped ``courting this mad dog,'' said the
newspaper, repeating the insult that Iraqi newspapers have often
used in referring to Butler.
	   Babil said its remarks were in reaction to Butler's refusal to
accept Iraq's claim that it has no more information to give to the
United Nations on its illegal weapons programs.
	   Iraq says it has destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction,
as required by the U.N. Security Council, and that the United
Nations must respond by lifting the economic sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Butler, an Australian who heads the United Nations Special
Commission charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, says he needs more evidence from the Iraqis supporting
their claims.
	   Butler arrived in Baghdad Thursday for talks with Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz aimed at eliciting that evidence.
	   ``I am very glad to be back and I am looking forward to our
talks ... I am very hopeful we will make some good progress,''
Butler told reporters. He did not elaborate.
	   Butler is accompanied by 18 senior U.N. arms experts who are
carrying satellite images, charts and material evidence to back
UNSCOM's position that Iraq is also hiding information on illegal
weapons.
	   The Iraq-U.N. dispute has the potential for a crisis similar to
the one earlier this year when Iraq refused to open its
presidential sites for weapons inspections. The United States and
Britain responded with threats of military strikes until Iraq
relented under a deal with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
	   Butler is carrying a three-page list of obligations that he says
Iraq must fulfill. Among his key complaints and demands are:
	   _ UNSCOM needs information on long-range missiles that Iraq
bought from other countries.
	   _ Iraq needs to prove it has scrapped all biological and
chemical warheads and missile fuel.
	   _ Baghdad must provide documentation on domestic production of
long-range missiles.
	   _ Iraq must prove that it dismantled unaccounted for chemical
munitions, including 155mm mustard gas shells, as well as chemical
and biological aerial bombs.
	   _ It must fully account for its past activities in producing the
chemical agent VX.
	   No details of Butler's schedule during his five-day visit have
been released.
	   On Wednesday, Aziz accused Butler of masterminding another
``political ploy'' to prolong sanctions against Iraq.
	   He said the latest demands by Butler are designed to serve U.S.
and British interests. ``They want to destroy Iraq to (make it)
surrender, and they know Iraq will never do that,'' Aziz said in a
speech at a Christian conference in Baghdad.

Viagra pills disappear at Israeli parliament inquiry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Some Israeli member of parliament just couldn't
restrain himself.
	   Samples of the Viagra anti-impotence pill disappeared at a
meeting of the parliamentary science committee on Wednesday,
causing great embarrassment among the doctors and other experts who
had been called to testify about whether the drug is safe or not.
	   The theft was discovered when committee chairwoman Dalia Itzik
asked if she could keep the box the pills came in, a committee
official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Dr. Ami Sidi, an Israeli expert on impotence, opened the package
to empty it before handing it over, and found that only four of the
eight pills he had brought were left.
	   Shortly afterwards, the empty box also disappeared.

Striking teachers clash with riot police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Striking teachers clashed with police
outside schools around Athens on Thursday, leaving at least one
person injured, authorities said.
	   The strikers were protesting new examinations introduced for
qualified teachers who wish to be appointed to state-run schools,
saying their university degrees should be the only qualification
necessary.
	   Under the previous system, teachers had to wait for years before
they received a state job.
	   Police used tear gas to push back protesters from a central
Athens high school, arresting three people.
	   Another two demonstrators were arrested and one police officer
suffered slight injuries when teachers attempted to occupy a school
in Pefki, a northern suburb, police said.
	   Teachers began a 48-hour strike to coincide with the start of
examinations on Friday, and have attempted to occupy schools where
they are set to take place in an effort to disrupt the tests.
	   Clashes between riot squads and teachers were also reported
outside at least one other Athens school.

Muslim separatists kill four nomads in Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Suspected Muslim insurgents killed four
members of a nomadic Muslim tribe by slitting their throats in a
late night attack in a Kashmiri village, police said Thursday.
	   Inspector-General of Police Kuldeep Khuda said the attackers
killed three men and a woman of the cattle-rearing Gujjar community
in the Phagla area, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) northwest of
the state's winter capital of Jammu late Wednesday.
	   Another woman was critically injured.
	   Investigators said the militants apparently suspected the
victims were police informants. No separatist group claimed
responsibility.
	   Kashmiri insurgent groups have been fighting for a decade to
secede from India. Kashmir is the only predominantly Muslim state
in largely Hindu India.

through lists of equipment on the sprawling six-module, 120-ton
outpost and put every piece where it should be in accordance with
manuals, Valery Lyndin, a spokesman for the Mission Control Center,
said Thursday.
	   ``It's routine work, every crew has to do it,'' Lyndin said in a
telephone interview.
	   Earlier this month, Valery Ryumin, Russian co-director of
shuttle-Mir program, flew to Mir on board the U.S. space shuttle
Discovery. He fumed about the station being cluttered with
equipment.
	   ``This is a serious problem,'' Ryumin said in an interview from
orbit. ``I'd like to know how this happened.''
	   Apart from the inventory Musabayev and Budarin started on
Thursday, they will also carry out some routine maintenance work on
Mir's power unit and oxygen generator.
	   The 12-year old space station has been running smoothly in
recent months, except for a recent computer breakdown that was
quickly fixed. Last year, Mir lurched from crisis to crisis,
including a fire, a collision with a cargo ship and a breakdown of
life-support systems.
	   Russian space officials had planned to keep the aging station
flying until the end of 1999, after the first parts of the
international space station are placed in orbit.
	   However, the government's desperate cash shortage may lead to a
decision to discard it as early as this fall, space officials said.

China declines comment on Italian president's Tiananmen stop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China declined comment Thursday on Italian
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's unscheduled stop in Tiananmen
Square, the center of a 1989 democracy movement crushed by the
military.
	   Scalfaro later told Italian reporters he went to the vast plaza
in central Beijing on Monday to offer prayers. Although he did not
say who he prayed for, an Italian reporter present said Scalfaro
was clearly talking about the hundreds if not thousands of people
killed in the military assault.
	   Human rights groups in the United States and members of the U.S.
Congress are urging President Bill Clinton to make a similar
gesture if he will not cancel his planned summit in Beijing in two
weeks.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said he did not
know anything about Scalfaro's Tiananmen visit. When asked at a
media briefing if Clinton might be allowed to do the same, Zhu said
only that the White House has agreed to the formal welcoming
ceremony on the square that China gives most foreign leaders.
	   The violent quelling of the massive student-led demonstrations
remains one of China's most sensitive political issues. Acts of
mourning are outlawed in the square for fear they will spark
renewed protests against Communist Party rule.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin formally welcomed Scalfaro on the
square on Tuesday. Afterwards at the start of talks with Jiang,
Scalfaro told reporters he had already been to the square Monday,
after visiting China's former imperial palace.
	   ``I asked to be taken to Tiananmen Square for a meditation and a
prayer to remember all those who fell, with the duty of taking past
experience in order to walk to the future,'' Scalfaro was quoted by
Italian reporters as saying. Jiang smiled stiffly.

NATO defense ministers look at possible action on Kosovo

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ruehe statement &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO should conduct an ``immediate
firepower demonstration'' followed by air exercises in Albania and
Macedonia as a way to end the violence in the separatist Serbian
province of Kosovo, NATO officials said Thursday.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, in his remarks to his 15
fellow NATO defense ministers, said this action, in line with
recommendations from NATO ambassadors, ``would serve as a serious
warning to Belgrade.''
	   The maneuvers should accompany instructions to NATO military
planners to look into direct military action in Kosovo, with
``particular consideration to air strikes against selected targets
and the employment of air and/or ground forces if necessary to
enforce a settlement for Kosovo, as a last resort,'' Ruehe said.
	   A U.S. defense official, speaking privately, said the action
should be carried out in the next few days.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, after a private meeting
with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, conferred with his 15
NATO colleagues Thursday on possible steps the alliance could take
to stop the fighting between the Serb-led Yugoslav army and police
against ethnic Albanians.
	   Speaking in Rome prior to flying to Brussels, Cohen said he
hoped the West would not have to resort to military action, but he
left the option open.
	   ``It is important to end this scandal of the bombing and
shelling of innocent people. We will work to achieve that at every
level _ diplomatic, economic and hopefully not military _ but we're
not ruling it out either,'' Cohen said at a news conference with
Italian Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta.
	   ``This is the threat of force to back up diplomacy,'' said
British Defense Secretary George Robertson. ``Just as it was in the
Gulf, so it is in Kosovo.''
	   The NATO air action involving several nations will be conducted
under the command of Adm. Joseph Lopez, the Naples-based American
officer who heads NATO's Southern Command, a senior U.S. official
said. The exercises will involve land or sea-based aircraft flying
over Albania and Macedonia.
	   It wasn't clear how many planes would be involved or how long it
would last.
	   ``There is a growing common understanding about the need for a
serious warning to Belgrade,'' said Ruehe. ``We have to plan for
meaningful military measures.'' He stressed that those measures had
to be ``parallel to the political process. This is not an internal
affair, it concerns stability and human rights in Europe.''
	   Beyond possible air maneuvers over neighboring Albania and
Macedonia, the ministers also were debating moves to establish
military training and exercise centers and use of NATO transport to
help cope with refugee flows.
	   For two weeks NATO military planners have followed earlier
instructions to study indirect options for pressuring Milosevic.
Among the options are dispatching up to 20,000 troops to Albania
and Macedonia to reinforce the existing 750-man U.N. force in
Macedonia and help both countries secure their borders while
dealing with refugees and arms smugglers.
	   In Kosovo, more than 250 people have died in clashes between
government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of
the Albanian independence movement. Ethnic Albanians, who comprise
90 percent of the southern province's population, demand
independence from Serbia, dominant of Yugoslavia's two republics.
	   The United States and its allies support autonomy for Kosovo but
oppose demands for independence and condemn violence on both sides.

Death toll in Armenian bus fire rises to four
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ A teacher and a schoolgirl died of heavy
burns on Thursday, bringing the death toll from the weekend bus
fire in Armenia to four, officials said Thursday.
	   Ripsime Khachatrian, 43, and Anna Oganesian, 13, died in the
Yerevan Central Hospital, hospital officials said. Two schoolboys
died in the same clinic earlier this week.
	   More than 20 schoolchildren were badly burned when their bus,
carrying 40 students, teachers and parents returning from a picnic,
exploded Sunday on a country road near the village of Bartsrashen,
30 kilometers (19 miles) south of Yerevan.
	   Officials said the explosion was apparently caused by a gas
leak.
	   Most buses and other vehicles in Armenia run on natural gas.
Gasoline is in short supply due to an economic blockade imposed by
neighboring Azerbaijan because of the two countries' territorial
conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.
	   Several other victims remain in grave condition, said Norair
Davidian, Armenia's top burn-treatment expert.

Monarchs coach Lionel Taylor resigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lionel Taylor, the all-time leading receiver in
Denver Broncos' history, has resigned as the coach of the England
Monarchs after a 3-7 season, the team announced Thursday.
	   The losing season was the fifth straight for the Monarchs in NFL
Europe, the league's developmental and promotional arm on the
continent.
	   Taylor joined the Monarchs as an offensive coordinator in 1995
and moved up to head coach two games into the 1996 season.
	   ``I have enjoyed my time with the Monarchs, even though I have
been disappointed at our results on the field,'' he said. ``I felt
it was best for me and the team to make a change.''
	   In addition to his years with the Broncos, Taylor was also an
offensive assistant on two Pittsburgh Steelers teams that won Super
Bowls.

NATO not welcome among Albanians near the Yugoslav border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN MURPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PADESH BORDER POST, Albania (AP) _ A guard adjusted his
binoculars and peered down the steep valley at a convoy of Serbian
military vehicles on the other side of the border.
	   ``That's where NATO should send their soldiers,'' snapped
Albanian Pvt. Perparim Kulici. ``Why Albania? They should go where
there is violence.''
	   As NATO officials convene in Brussels to try and organize NATO
air exercises in Albania and Macedonia, at the doorstep of the
conflict in the Serbian province of Kosovo, Albanians and their kin
in Kosovo are not rolling out the welcome mat.
	   They believe that that foreign troops in Albania would only
benefit the Serbs by strangling the ability of the ethnic Albanian
separatists to funnel weapons and supplies from Albania into
Kosovo.
	   But some military planners contend that the local hostility to
outside forces fails to consider that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic might otherwise bring his battle across the border,
striking at the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is leading the fight
for independence in the predominately ethnic Albanian province.
	   Without a show of military resolve by the West, Milosevic may
see an ``open door'' to eventually take the conflict into Albania,
the source of arms for the rebels, said a Western military official
in Tirana who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   ``Signals are showing that a new Bosnia is coming up,'' warned
Ilir Meta, Albanian State Secretary for European Integration.
	   The Albanian government has pushed hard for an outside military
presence in its lawless northeastern frontier region, fearing not
only Serb aggression, but also looking for help to prevent looting
by KLA supporters of Albanian armories and police stations.
	   Western leaders have promised not to repeat past mistakes in the
Balkans and seek to quell the conflict before it spins out of
control.
	   If NATO does deploy in Albania and neighboring Macedonia, it may
couple that with threats of air strikes against the Serbs if they
do not stop their assaults on Kosovo Albanians.
	   In northeast Albania and Kosovo itself, local voices questioning
a possible military mission are being drowned out by calls for
action by NATO allies.
	   Some rebel militia men have even threatened to lash back at
foreign troops if they interfere with the supply routes to
separatists in Kosovo.
	   ``Do we have a choice?'' asked Enver Caja, who says he is a KLA
leader organizing supply runs from the Albanian village Tropoja.
``We will have to shoot at NATO if they block us.''
	   ``Why don't the troops intervene directly in Kosovo? The West is
trying to look strong, but instead it looks weak by coming to
Albania and not Kosovo, where people are dying,'' complained Ajim
Kulipi in Tropoja, the first stop for many of the estimated 10,000
refugees who have fled Kosovo to Albania.
	   But the opposition to military intervention is not universal. A
Tropoja merchant, Ibrahim Selimi, said a NATO force at the border
could be an ``important show of power to the Serbs.''
	   Besides overcoming local resistance, any possible outside ground
force would face huge logistical hurdles. The terrain is a maze of
razor-edged peaks and plunging valleys. The 20-kilometer (12-mile)
road from the provincial center of Bajram Curri to Tropoja is
little more than a rutted path in some places.
	   Military engineers would need more than a month just to make an
adequate road, said William Foxton, an observer with the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is
advising Western leaders on the conditions in the border region.
	   ``And then you would have to build helicopter pads, fuel depots,
water facilities,'' he said. ``It would be an enormous and costly
task that I'm not sure NATO is ready to undertake.''

Singapore job recruitment: No one need apply
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Singapore-Economy

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A leading job recruitment fair has been
postponed due to lack of employer interest and the seventh
consecutive monthly decline in ``help wanted'' advertisements,
newspapers reported Thursday.
	   The decline in job ads began last November, and the volume is 45
percent less than for the same seven-month period a year before,
The Business Times reported.
	   Executive job ads fell 42 percent in May from the year before.
Recruitment ads for non-executive fared worse, plunging 62 percent,
and those for manufacturing were down 61 percent.
	   Singaporeans, largely untouched by the regional economic crisis
last year, have begun to feel it. The first sign has been lack of
job choice, especially for university graduates and middle-level
managers used to moving up in Singapore's ``get-ahead'' society.
	   The Ministry of Manpower said that the number of job vacancies,
which employers are seeking to fill, fell in the first quarter of
the year to an all-time low of 26,148 _ 44 percent down from the
same period last year.
	   Only 20 companies booked spaces for this year's Choice Employers
fair, compared to 100 that took part last July. The fair has been
put off until further notice.
	   ``If we cannot get companies interested in recruiting people
then there is no basis for the fair,'' project manager Jason Ng
told The Straits Times. ``There will be more people looking for
jobs, but if there are fewer offering jobs, then it defeats the
purpose of the event.''
	   Singapore had 2.2 percent unemployment in March and that figure
is expected to rise, as unions have predicted a record number of
jobless this year.

Doctor warns spread of killer virus to Southeast Asia and Hong
</HEADLINE>
Kong &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A virus that has claimed the lives of 32
small children has spread to northern Taiwan, and a doctor warned
Thursday it could spread further to Southeast Asia and Hong Kong.
	   The enterovirus 71 virus has reached its peak in central Taiwan,
but has now moved to the capital and surrounding areas, Lee
Ching-yun, a renowned doctor at the National Taiwan University,
told a news conference.
	   Lee urged parents not to take their young children abroad in the
summer vacation, warning the virus could spread to neighboring
countries soon, Lee said.
	   A Hong Kong Health Department spokesman said no cases of the
virus have been reported in the territory so far this year, and the
government has urged doctors to refer suspected cases to the
department.
	   Lee predicted the virus could infect up to half a million
Taiwanese, but only a tiny number will die of complications.
	   He asked parents to closely watch their children for symptoms of
the virus, which include inertia, headache and vomiting.
	   The virus, spread by physical contact, hits Taiwan each summer,
but this year's outbreak appears to be particularly severe.
	   Complications from the virus can include encephalitis,
meningitis, and acute inflammation of the heart muscle. Early
symptoms are similar to the flu. Later, ulcers or blisters in the
mouth and a rash on the hands and feet can develop.
	   The death toll increased to 32 Wednesday when a 2-year-old girl
died in Taipei.
	   Health authorities said at least 10,000 cases had been reported
in the past two months, including 269 in Taipei county.
	   Anxious parents flooded a hotline set up by the Health
Department's communicative disease department to seek advice on
treatment for their children.
	   Nursery schools in parts of the island were ordered closed for a
week or given the option of recessing.
	   Parents were urged to be sure children washed their hands
frequently and had clean changes of clothing.
	   Three U.S. experts, who arrived Taiwan last week, were
conducting three autopsies to help identify the cause of the
outbreak, officials said.
	   The virus has struck hardest in central Taiwan, where the warm,
wet climate is considered most conducive to its spread.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two Israeli teen-age boys were killed when the
roof of their high school gym collapsed during a basketball game in
the southern city of Beersheba, officials said Thursday.
	   The roof of the Makif Vav high school caved in Wednesday
evening. Thirteen boys managed to get out safely but the bodies of
Lior Kavalo, 13, and Shlomi Toledo, 14, were recovered Thursday
after firefighters and army engineers cleared the rubble.
	   The roof was being repaired because it leaked, Beersheba Mayor
David Bonfeld told Israel radio, and 22 tons of concrete had been
poured onto it. Police questioned six people including the engineer
responsible for the work, the radio reported.

category codes:
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopian and Eritrean forces
clashed Thursday along a third front in the region of an important
Red Sea port, a government spokeswoman said. Fighting also
continued in northwestern Ethiopia at the Badme-Shiraro military
post inside the Yirga triangle region, the 400-square-kilometer
(160-square-mile) area where the clash between the neighboring
countries broke out in early May, the spokeswoman Salome Tadesse
said. She could not provide the exact location of the fighting nor
the number of casualties. (ETHIOPIA-ERITREA)
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Rescue workers lit the pyre at a mass
cremation Thursday for more than 100 victims of a cyclone that
killed at least 559 people and devastated India's western coast.
Most of the deaths _ 550 _ were in Gujarat state, where the cyclone
first hit land Tuesday. The cyclone, with winds up to 100 kph (65
mph) when it first hit, had weakened by the time it moved north
later Tuesday, but still killed nine people in neighboring
Rajasthan state. (INDIA-CYCLONE).
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's most influential newspaper urged the
government to stop cooperating with chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler who began a crucial disarmament mission Thursday.
The ``time has come to chop the tongue of this dog,'' the Babil
newspaper, owned by President Saddam Hussein's son, Odai, said.
Butler, who heads the United Nations Special Commission charged
with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, says he needs
more evidence from the Iraqis supporting their claims. Butler
arrived in Baghdad Thursday for talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz. (IRAQ-BUTLER)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Flight attendants and ground crews of
troubled Philippine Airlines threatened Thursday to join a strike
by about 600 pilots if the company institutes layoffs in a move to
cut costs. ``We are going all the way with the pilots,'' said
Roberto Anduiza, president of the 2,100-strong Flight Attendants
and Stewardesses Association of the Philippines. Anduiza said some
members of the union would join the striking pilots in a picket
line later Thursday. Gerry Rivera, vice president of the PAL
Employees Association, said they will declare their own strike if
the company attempts to reduce the work force or slash salaries.
(PHILIPPINES-AIRLINE STRIKE)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian parliament's lower house gave
preliminary approval Thursday to a bill intended to prevent
President Boris Yeltsin from seeking a third term. Yeltsin's
uncertain health and a constitutional limit of two terms would
appear to rule out another bid and the president himself has said
he won't run. Yet presidential aides have hinted that the
67-year-old leader might again seek office in 2000. They claim that
Yeltsin's first term began during Soviet times and thus didn't
count toward the two-term limit. The Constitutional Court is
expected to rule on the issue later this year. (RUSSIA-PRESIDENTIAL

China concerned about yen devaluation, confident on Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China expressed concern Thursday that Japan's
weakening yen could destabilize still shaky financial markets
around Asia but was confident Hong Kong could withstand the
turbulence.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Hong Kong's local
government was taking effective measures to stimulate the economy
and stabilize sinking financial markets.
	   Those measures, plus the territory's dlrs 96 billion in foreign
exchange reserves, should be sufficient to maintain the Hong Kong
dollar's fixed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar, Zhu said.
	   If not, Zhu reiterated Beijing's readiness to use its dlrs 140
million in foreign exchange reserves to support the 15-year peg.
China has repeatedly pledged to guarantee Hong Kong's prosperity
since it resumed control over the former British colony last July.
	   ``We are confident that the Hong Kong economy will move out of
the difficult situation,'' Zhu said at a routine media briefing.
	   Zhu, however, urged Japan to take action to halt the yen's slide
and prevent further harm to economies weakened by a year of
financial turbulence.
	   Worries about the weakening yen caused financial markets to
plunge throughout Asia Thursday. Hong Kong's market fell to a
three-year low Wednesday and its flagship Hang Seng Index hit a new
three-year low Thursday.
	   ``We believe the continued devaluation of the Japanese yen will
be not be conducive to the stabilization of financial markets in
East Asia,'' Zhu said.
	   The spokesman repeated China's pledge not to devalue its own
currency and thereby possibly provoke other countries to devalue
their currencies to remain competitive.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KRZYZOWA, Poland (AP) _ In a show of Polish-German friendship,
Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl met
Thursday in a Silesian town to open a youth center and to hold
talks on European integration.
	   Youth center sponsors welcomed Kohl and Buzek with bread and
salt, a traditional greeting in the southwestern Silesian region
that was part of Germany before 1945.
	   After cutting the ribbon on the International Center for Youth
Meetings, Kohl and Buzek will talk with Polish, German and Czech
youth and take part in an ecumenical service.
	   ``Our main goal is to build tolerance between religions, nations
and people of different outlooks,'' said Edward Wasiewicz,
secretary general of the Krzyzowa Foundation, the Polish-German
group that sponsored the youth center.
	   Later Thursday, Kohl and Buzek are to hold talks on European
integration. Poland, along with Hungary and the Czech Republic, is
slated for membership in the European Union.
	   The town of Krzyzowa, located 130 kilometers (80 miles) from the
German border, was a meeting place for Nazi resisters during World
War II. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, it became a symbolic
spot for Polish-German reconciliation.
	   It was there eight years ago that Kohl and Poland's first
non-communist prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, spontaneously
embraced during a Catholic Mass at a point when participants
normally shake hands. That meeting helped pave the way for a
historic 1991 Polish-German friendship treaty.
	   The German government gave 30 million marks (dlrs 17 million)
toward establishing the youth center on the former estate of Count
Hellmuth James von Moltke, a member of the group that plotted the
1944 assassination attempt on Hitler. The conspirators were hanged.
	   The center has 116 beds, a 220-seat auditorium and a gymnasium.
In operation since 1994, it has housed school and youth groups from
Europe and Israel.

China lectures India during boundary talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China used low-level border negotiations with
India to criticize New Delhi for portraying Beijing as a security
threat to justify its nuclear tests, a Chinese Foreign Ministry
official said Thursday.
	   Diplomats and military experts made no progress during the talks
Monday and Tuesday to resolve the disputed border, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said.
	   Instead, negotiators used the talks, the sixth round of
discussions and the first since India's nuclear explosions last
month, to ``emphatically exchange views'' on relations, Zhu said
using unusually strong language for China's cautious diplomatic
corps.
	   ``The Chinese side pointed out that recently Indian leaders
repeatedly issued remarks slandering China, seriously hurting the
feelings of the Chinese people and undermining the sound atmosphere
for improving bilateral relations,'' Zhu said at a news briefing.
	   An Indian Embassy spokesman said India's negotiators did not
trade condemnations and their Chinese counterparts were not wholly
unwilling to discuss the issues of resolving the disputed boundary
and easing tensions on the border.
	   ``It is really not a question of accepting allegations of the
so-called slander statements,'' said the spokesman, Krishan Varma.
``They had their statement, and we urged them to continue making
progress.''
	   Remarks by members of India's nationalist ruling coalition have
challenged recent Chinese efforts to appear a more responsible
global power. In a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton, Indian
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee singled out China's nuclear
capabilities as a reason for its decision to test.
	   China has tried to sooth anxieties throughout Asia about its
growing clout since it launched test-missiles near Taiwan two years
ago. China has reached out to India, a virtual enemy since their
brief, bloody border war in 1962, and both sides have stepped up
negotiations to ease tensions along their frontier.
	   During the latest talks, ``the Chinese side strongly urged the
Indian side to immediately stop all unwarranted accusations against
China and act concretely'' to restore relations, Zhu said.

Apartheid state investigated race-specific weapons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The apartheid government
investigated the possibility of developing a bacteria that would
selectively kill or injure black people but leave white people
unharmed, a scientist said Thursday.
	   Speaking at a hearing of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, Daan Goosen described a search for an unnamed European
scientist alleged to know about a bacteria that would only hurt
blacks.
	   The information came from the military attache at the South
African Embassy in London in 1983 or 1984, Goosen said.
	   Goosen said reading scientific literature and journals led him
to believe it could be a feasible project, but he backed out of a
planned trip to London to find the scientist, fearing it could be a
trap.
	   The scientist said he had conducted the research on orders from
Dr. Wouter Basson, an army physician who set up a sophisticated
network of front companies to research biological and chemical
weapons. Goosen headed a covert military research laboratory under
Basson's control.
	   Goosen compared the search for the drug with U.S. President
Ronald Reagan's Star Wars project, an idea that Reagan had about
putting weapons into outer space to maintain world peace.
	   A selectively destructive bacteria could likewise have been used
domestically as a threat to keep the white government in power,
Goosen said.
	   ``A thing like this can be used to maintain peace,'' he said
``Peace means being the strongest power and this is the
strongest.''
	   Goosen admitted that hindsight showed his work was not
justifiable. But he said the prospect of keeping order amid an
increasingly resistant black population during apartheid's most
turbulent time gave impetus to Basson's work.
	   ``I was not thinking rationally at the time. Today I know I was
wrong. You can't do that to people, it is just not justifiable,''
Goosen said.
	   Since Monday, the panel that is investigating apartheid-era
crimes has also been hearing scientists describe working in a
poison factory that put deadly substances into drinks and
cigarettes that were passed onto apartheid hit squads.
	   Operatives considered poisoning President Nelson Mandela and
failed in an attempt to poison anti-apartheid cleric Frank Chikane,
now a top adviser to Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, by contaminating
his underwear.
	   The Truth Commission was set up by Mandela in 1995, a year after
South Africa's first all-race elections swept the African National
Congress into power and ended apartheid.
	   In a statement on Wednesday, the ANC compared the former
apartheid government with Adolf Hitler's Third Reich, which used
scientists to devise ways of exterminating millions of Jews,
Gypsies and others.

Malaysia ponders future strategy on water crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with details of water plan

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia will draw up a long-term
blueprint to ensure that other cities do not face the kind of water
shortage plaguing the capital, a government minister said Thursday.
	   The strategy is to guarantee sufficient water supply for the
country in the next 25 years, said Works Minister Samy Vellu.
	   A June 29 meeting of water officials and state chief ministers
to discuss Malaysia's water needs will be chaired by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, the national news agency, Bernama, quoted Vellu
as saying.
	   ``We will discuss the problems and set our target so that the
country will not face water shortage in the long term,'' Vellu
said.
	   Nearly 2 million people in Kuala Lumpur and its suburbs have
been on severe water rationing for three months.
	   This week consumer groups threatened to sue the state government
that is responsible for supplying water to large parts of the city
and its suburbs, drawing criticism that it was trying to politicize
the crisis.
	   The proposed class-action lawsuit could seek as much as half a
million ringgit (dlrs 128,000) in compensation, said A. Jayaseelan
of the Selangor and Federal Territory Consumer Association. The
other group involved in the proposed suit is the Federation of
Malaysian Consumers Associations.
	   Selangor state Chief Minister Abu Hassan was quoted by Star
newspaper on Thursday as accusing consumer groups of collaborating
with opposition parties to make the water shortage a political
issue.
	   ``It is working with the opposition as if it was one of them,''
he said of FOMCA.
	   FOMCA denied there was a ``hidden agenda'' in its campaign for
more water for residents.
	   ``This is a voluntary and civic-minded organization,'' said the
consumer group's president M. Hamdan.
	   Consumer activists say the lawsuit, to be filed in about two
months, will prove that the water shortage was a crisis caused by
negligence, not the drought in Southeast Asia brought on by the El
Nino weather phenomenon.
	   The decision to file a suit came after the police denied
permission to consumer groups to hold a meeting with residents to
discuss the water crisis. The consumer groups later issued a joint
statement with opposition parties criticizing the police.

Highly mobile air defense system installed in Russian Baltic

enclave &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A new, highly mobile air defense system has been
put into operation in Russia's westernmost Kaliningrad region, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported Thursday.
	   The Russkiy Telegraf newspaper commented that installment of the
new system proved Moscow's seriousness in warning that it would be
forced to answer NATO's eastward expansion with defense measures.
	   Maj. Gen. Fyodor Krisanov, who is in charge of the Baltic
Fleet's air defense, said Wednesday that the Baltic enclave of
Kaliningrad, bordering on Lithuania and Poland, was the first
region to be protected by the S-300PS system, the most advanced
version of the Soviet-designed air defense systems.
	   He said that the system has a range of 75 kilometers and can be
deployed in five minutes, track six targets simultaneously and fire
12 missiles at a time, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The system will be fired for the first time in August, during
the fleet's summer exercises.
	   Poland is among the first three former Warsaw Pact members to be
invited to join the western alliance. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia
are all eager to join, as well.
	   But Russia is bitterly opposed to NATO membership for the three
former Soviet republics in the Baltics, arguing that the western
alliance would gain a strategically critical toehold on Russia's
western borders.
	   Russia last year offered the three countries security guarantees
if they would abandon their efforts to join NATO, but all three
refused.

Cambodia's Ranariddh urges commanders to forego amnesty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with resistance general's rejection in grafs 2, 12-15;
DELETES outdated material in last 3 grafs pvs

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Ousted Cambodian Co-Prime Minister
Prince Norodom Ranariddh on Thursday urged his generals to drop
their demands for an amnesty so that his resistance forces and the
government could reach a peace agreement.
	   His top commander immediately rejected the suggestion, however,
calling for a formal ceasefire before any other deals or concession
were made.
	   After Ranariddh was deposed by his co-premier Hun Sen in a coup
d'etat last July, the prince and two of his top military aides were
tried and convicted of plotting their own takeover.
	   Ranariddh was granted an amnesty, allowing him to return from
exile to contest a general election to be held in July.
	   But the amnesty was not extended to his generals, Nhek Bunchhay
and Serei Kosal, who lead a small resistance force of the prince's
loyalists in northern Cambodia.
	   The charges against Ranariddh and his generals were widely
considered to be politically motivated.
	   Peace talks between the government and the resistance broke off
Wednesday with both sides blaming each other for the deadlock.
	   Ranariddh on Thursday told his resistance commanders to shelve
their demand for amnesty and to move toward integration into the
government-controlled Royal Cambodian Armed Forces.
	   He said a permanent ceasefire, reintegration of resistance
soldiers into the army and the return of refugees to take part in
the July 26 elections took priority over the amnesty issue.
	   ``I'd like to say that we must put aside the issue of amnesty
for Gen. Nhek Bunchhay and Serei Kosal for a while,'' Ranariddh
told reporters after delivering a speech to about 1,000 supporters
at the headquarters of his FUNCINPEC party.
	   ``I think that the issue of integration must be settled first,''
he said. ``As the king has suggested, we solve these issues first
and we will be able to solve the issue of amnesty afterward.''
	   Nhek Bunchhay, contacted by telephone, rejected Ranariddh's
advice.
	   ``We cannot integrate without any conditions from us,'' he told
The Associated Press. ``We cannot accept it.''
	   He insisted that a ceasefire be formalized between his
resistance group and the government before any reintegration, and
threatened to disengage his group from any future peace talks if
the government continues its military offensive against him.
	   ``I've been attacked all the time. If they continue, we will
react in order to defend ourselves,'' he said.
	   Ranariddh is anxious to reintegrate his forces into the
government army because if he is judged to be in command of an
independent military force, he could be found ineligible to run in
the elections.

Italian premier to boycott meeting of European group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi will boycott a meeting of his
European Parliament group next week because members of the leading
Italian opposition party were allowed to join it, a Prodi aide said
Thursday.
	   The European People's Party, a coalition of center-right
political parties, opened its arms Tuesday to 20 lawmakers
belonging to media mogul Silvio Berlusconi's conservative Forza
Italia party.
	   Prodi is a member of the European People's Party along with five
other European leaders, including German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
	   Leaders from the party are scheduled to meet in Cardiff, Wales,
June 14, the day before the opening of the EU summit.
	   Prodi's diplomatic adviser, Roberto Nigido, confirmed that Prodi
would not attend although the premier's participation at the EU
meeting is not in question.

Yeltsin, foreign minister discuss Kosovo on eve of G-8 talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin and Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov discussed the crisis in Kosovo during a telephone
conversation Thursday on the eve of Primakov's talks with his
counterparts in the Group of Eight.
	   Russia firmly opposes options for military intervention being
considered by NATO. However, Moscow favors strengthened control
over Kosovo's borders with Albania and Macedonia, Foreign Ministry
officials said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Primakov is expected to present these views during a meeting in
London with foreign ministers of the G-8 nations. No details of his
conversation with Yeltsin were disclosed.
	   NATO is considering military intervention to stop Serbian
attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The alliance has also
considered indirect options for pressuring Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, who is blamed for the attacks.
	   Yeltsin has said that he would try to use his influence on
Milosevic, but that he remains firmly against NATO intervention.
Russia is also unlikely to support a ban on investment in Serbia
and a freeze of its foreign assets, Primakov has said.
	   More than 250 people have died in Kosovo during clashes between
government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of
the Albanian independence movement.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of the southern
province's population, are demanding independence from Serbia, the
dominant republic of the two left in the Yugoslav federation.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The government has banned local and foreign
tourists from traveling to northern Iraq, saying American and
Israeli agents are roaming freely in the area, a Baghdad weekly
reported Thursday.
	   Al-Zawra said the government's Tourism Department issued orders
to travel agencies asking them not to organize trips to the
districts of Irbil, Dahouk and Sulaimaniya, which are under
government control.
	   All other districts in northern Iraq are under control of
Kurdish rebels who are helped by the United States and Britain. The
two nations' air forces enforce a no-fly zone over the area to keep
away the Iraqi military.
	   ``The extraordinary situation in our beloved north and the
presence of American and Zionist (Israeli) agents there makes the
region unstable from the security point of view,'' the weekly said,
quoting Tourism Department head Abdulkarim Maki.
	   It did not elaborate and Maki was not immediately available for
comment.
	   The ban on travel applies only to tourists. People who have
relatives or legitimate business in the area can still go. Most of
the tourists to northern Iraq are people from central and southern
Iraq, escaping the scorching summer heat or seeking winter snow
holidays.
	   Travel agents in Baghdad said thousands of Iraqis had signed up
for package tours this summer.
	   Foreign tourists rarely visit Iraq, and those who do hardly ever
go to Kurdish areas.
	   The decision to ban tourists is a surprise because state-owned
television and another station owned by President Saddam Hussein's
eldest son, Odai, recently began broadcasting commercials promoting
the region.

Norway imposes visa requirement for Croatians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway will require visas for all visitors
from Croatia in hopes of stemming the flow of mainly Serb refugees
from the country's troubled East Slavonia province, the justice
ministry announced Thursday.
	   According the ministry, 2,350 asylum seeker from Croatia have
arrived in Norway since the beginning of the year, and in about 70
percent of the 351 cases handled so far the government found no
grounds to grant asylum.
	   Minister of Justice Aud-Inger Aure said the decision brings
Norway's policy in line with that of its Nordic neighbors. Sweden
has required visas since Croatia became independent in 1992, and
Denmark imposed a visa requirement last month following the arrival
of 160 Croatian asylum seekers.
	   ``There is a long tradition of the Nordic countries seeking to
have a joint Nordic visa policy,'' she said.
	   Eastern Slavonia region was returned to Croatian authority on
Jan. 15 after two years under United Nations administration. Rebel
Serbs seized the area at the start of the ethnic wars that swept
the former Yugoslavia, and now complain of harassment.

NATO defense ministers look at possible action on Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ruehe statement &QL;

 &UR; By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Military Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO should conduct an ``immediate
firepower demonstration'' followed by air exercises as a way to end
the violence in the separatist Serbian province of Kosovo, NATO
officials said Thursday.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, in his remarks to his 15
fellow NATO defense ministers, said this action, in line with
recommendations from NATO ambassadors, ``would serve as a serious
warning to Belgrade.''
	   The maneuvers should accompany instructions to NATO military
planners to look into direct military action in Kosovo, with
``particular consideration to air strikes against selected targets
and the employment of air and/or ground forces if necessary to
enforce a settlement for Kosovo, as a last resort,'' Ruehe said.
	   A U.S. defense official, speaking privately, said the action
should be carried out in the next few days.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, after a private meeting
with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, conferred with his NATO
colleagues Thursday on possible steps the alliance could take to
stop the fighting between the Serb-led Yugoslav forces and ethnic
Albanians.
	   Speaking in Rome, prior to flying to Brussels, Cohen said he
hoped the West would not have to resort to military action, but he
left the option open.
	   ``It is important to end this scandal of the bombing and
shelling of innocent people. We will work to achieve that at every
level _ diplomatic, economic and hopefully not military _ but we're
not ruling it out either,'' Cohen said at a news conference with
Italian Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta.
	   ``This is the threat of force to back up diplomacy,'' said
British Defense Secretary George Robertson.
	   The NATO air action involving several nations will be conducted
under the command of Adm. Joseph Lopez, the Naples-based American
officer who heads NATO's Southern Command, a senior U.S. official
said. The exercises will involve land or sea-based aircraft flying
over Albania and Macedonia.
	   It wasn't clear how many planes would be involved or how long it
would last.
	   ``There is a growing common understanding about the need for a
serious warning to Belgrade,'' said Ruehe. ``We have to plan for
meaningful military measures.'' He stressed that those measures had
to be ``parallel to the political process. This is not an internal
affair, it concerns stability and human rights in Europe.''
	   Beyond possible air maneuvers over neighboring Albania and
Macedonia, the ministers also were debating moves to establish
military training and exercise centers and use of NATO transport to
help cope with refugee flows.
	   For two weeks NATO military planners have followed earlier
instructions to study indirect options for pressuring Milosevic.
Among the options are dispatching up to 20,000 troops to Albania
and Macedonia to reinforce the existing 750-man U.N. force in
Macedonia and to help both countries secure their borders while
dealing with refugees and arms smugglers.
	   In Kosovo, more than 250 people have died in clashes between
government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of
the Albanian independence movement. Ethnic Albanians, who comprise
90 percent of the southern province's population, demand
independence from Serbia, the dominant of Yugoslavia's two
republics.
	   The United States and its allies support autonomy for Kosovo but
oppose demands for independence and condemn violence on both sides.

Prisoner on jogging tour leaves his guards in the dust
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A Norwegian prison inmate allowed to go
jogging with four of his guards turned out to be in pretty good
shape. Too good, in fact.
	   When the small entourage reached a recreation area outside the
prison in the northern town of Bodoe, the prisoner picked up the
pace, pulled ahead of his guards and escaped, the Norwegian news
agency NTB reported on Thursday.
	   The prisoner, identified only as a man in his late 20s, had been
jailed for petty crimes, and as trustee had been granted special
privileges, including excursions outside the prison, the report
said.
	   The escapee can expect to have his privileges revoked, assuming,
of course, that police manage to catch him.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ After volatile morning trading that pushed most
Asian stocks and currencies down, some Asian markets rebounded
Thursday on bargain hunting as the Japanese yen touched, but failed
to break through, the key psychological level of 142 yen to the
U.S. dollar. Tokyo and Bangkok stocks fell sharply. Analysts said
the markets were only taking a breather, and warned of more
turbulence if the yen's weakness persists. ``I wouldn't say we've
turned the corner. Aside from the weak yen dragging Southeast Asian
currencies lower, a lot of attention is on the yen's implications
for the Chinese yuan and the Hong Kong dollar,'' said Daragh Maher,
an economist at ING Barings in Singapore. (Asian Markets)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Further economic integration of Southeast
Asia's battered economies is essential for the region's recovery,
ASEAN's top official said Thursday. Rodolfo Severino, secretary
general of the nine-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
said Asia ``must continue to think regional'' to work together to
bring badly-needed foreign investments back to the region's
cash-strapped economies. ``We must face the world together and
continue this trend towards greater importance to regional
interests,'' Severino told The Associated Press on the sidelines of
a conference on the region's financial crisis. Spooked by
protracted financial instability, foreign investors have continued
fleeing the region in recent weeks. (Hong Kong-ASEAN)
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The day after a dramatic stock and currency
dive, Singapore's key market indices recovered somewhat Thursday,
but further declines are expected as this Southeast Asian financial
service hub braces for a worsening regional economic crisis.
``Singapore is extremely vulnerable to external developments, no
matter how well it runs its economy domestically, no matter how
prudent the government's fiscal policy,'' said Bruce Gale of the
Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy, Ltd.
``Singaporeans are going to get a rude shock,'' Gale added. Until
now, this glittering island republic has been sheltered from the
turmoil that's hit other parts of the region. However, a wave of
tough economic news this week may signal the end of good times for
Singapore's 3.1 million people. (Singapore-Economy)
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's economic crisis has hampered
its ability to help refugees flooding in from neighboring
countries, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday. Nearly
200,000 refugees who have fled fighting in Myanmar, Cambodia and
Laos have taken shelter inside Thailand's borders during the last
several years. Added to two million Thais unemployed because of the
economic downturn and over 800,000 illegal foreign workers, the
refugees have created a burden for the country, said Kobsak
Chutikul, the ministry spokesman. The government has no plans,
however, to change its refugee policies or cut back services to
refugee camps despite their drain on shrinking government
resources, he said. (Thailand-Economy-Refugees)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ An architect of Hong Kong's linked exchange
rate system said Thursday that the Hong Kong currency's peg with
the U.S. dollar wouldn't be shaken loose by a devaluation of
China's yuan. Speaking at a conference on Asia's financial crisis,
John Greenwood, chief economist at LGT Asset Management, said the
yuan has depreciated by about 70 percent since the 1980s, but none
of the previous devaluations has hurt the Hong Kong dollar. If
market rumors of another yuan devaluation prove true, there's no
reason to expect the Hong Kong dollar would come under pressure, he
said. ``I see no reason why Hong Kong's method of economic
adjustment should be changed just because there may be change (in
the Chinese yuan),'' he said. (Hong Kong-Yuan Devaluation)

CIA chief meets Arafat and top security officers in Gaza
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ CIA Director George Tenet discussed a U.S
proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and his senior security advisers, a Palestinian
official said Thursday.
	   The official, who attended Wednesday night's meeting in Gaza,
told The Associated Press that Tenet's meeting with the
Palestinians was part of his visit to the region which included
stops in Israel, Jordan and Egypt.
	   Richard Scorza, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv
declined comment on the report, also broadcast by Israel Radio.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the talks
touched generally on the stalled peace process between Israel and
the Palestinians and involved a review of a U.S. proposal for
Israel to withdraw from 13.1 percent from the West Bank.
	   The official declined to say if specific arrangements for the
withdrawal were discussed.
	   Since the breakdown in talks more than a year ago, the CIA has
acted as a catalyst for Israeli-Palestinian cooperation on security
issues.

 &UR; Israel destroys Hebron family's house for third time
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with Israeli guard stabbed in
scuffle in Jerusalem neighborhood. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli security guard was stabbed Thursday
in an argument with a Palestinian family over an archaeological dig
in a contested neighborhood of Jerusalem, police said.
	   The guard was slightly injured, police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby
said. Several Palestinians were arrested, but the stabber got away,
he said.
	   The scuffle took place in the Silwan neighborhood next to
Jerusalem's Old City, one of several Arab neighborhoods in east
Jerusalem that have been targeted by settlers trying to expand the
Jewish presence in the city. The family lives next to the Israeli
dig, which has been going on for several years, Ben-Ruby said.
	   Earlier in the week, settlers moved into five apartments in
Silwan under cover of darkness, setting off shouting and shoving
matches with Arab neighbors.
	   Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the
1967 Mideast War, as a future capital, and see Israeli expansion
into Arab neighborhoods as preempting peace talks on the final
status of the city.
	   Also Thursday, Israeli troops bulldozed the home of a
Palestinian family in the West Bank town of Hebron that had been
twice rebuilt after earlier demolitions. Scuffles broke out between
the soldiers and family members and neighbors, who threw stones and
bottles.
	   Israeli peace activists had helped rebuild the Atrash family's
home in March, after it was razed on grounds that it was built
without a permit. It was demolished once before in 1988, on the
same grounds.
	   The house is built near an Israeli bypass road that is intended
to allow Jewish settlers and other Israelis to travel through the
West Bank without entering Palestinian towns.
	   Ten people lived in the house.
	   Zahour Atrash, 38, shouted for help as the house was torn down,
and vowed ``We will take revenge.''
	   ``The Israelis are destroying houses, the Israelis don't want
peace,'' she said. ``I will raise all my children to become Hamas
extremists.''
	   Mrs. Atrash said the family would rebuild the house again.
	   The Palestinians say Israel refuses to issue building permits in
areas of the West Bank it wants to keep under its control. Israel
says the demolitions are legitimate means of enforcing zoning
regulations.

Sabena tries out new luggage service
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Belgium's national airline, Sabena,
said Thursday it was testing a new service that picks up a
passenger's luggage from home or hotel 24 hours ahead of a flight.
	   The service is in response ``to the numerous clients who seek
more speed and flexibility,'' the airline said in a statement.
	   With the ``Home Advanced Check-In'' service customers get their
boarding passes in advance rendering an airport check-in
unnecessary.
	   The airline promises the luggage will be on the appropriate
flight. The service costs 1,500 francs (dlrs 40) in case of a
luggage pick-up from a hotel, and 2,000 francs (dlrs 55) from home.

Asian markets close mixed; some markets recover earlier losses

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout; CHANGES overline

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Some Asian markets rebounded on bargain hunting
Thursday after a sharp fall in the Japanese yen against the U.S.
dollar sent stocks and currencies across Asia down in early
trading.
	   But investors said the markets were only taking a breather, and
warned of more turbulence if the yen's weakness persists.
	   ``I wouldn't say we've turned the corner. Aside from the weak
yen dragging Southeast Asian currencies lower, a lot of attention
is on the yen's implications for the Chinese yuan and the Hong Kong
dollar,'' said Daragh Maher, an economist at ING Barings in
Singapore.
	   Early Thursday, the yen slid to a new seven-year low against the
U.S. dollar on the absence of yen-supportive comments after
Wednesday's meeting of finance officials from the Group of Seven
industrialized nations.
	   Growing concerns about a new round of financial turmoil in Asia
led to safe-haven dollar buying, traders said.
	   In late Asian trading, the dollar bought 141.68 yen, up 0.84 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate
of 141.43 yen overnight.
	   The U.S. currency moved as high as 142.10 yen, its highest level
in Tokyo since Sept. 6, 1990, when it reached 142.45 yen.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 325.22
points, or 2.12 percent, closing at 15,014.04 points, adding to
Wenesday's 1.23-percent fall.
	   In Bangkok, stock prices slumped for a fifth consecutive day as
foreign investors dumped big-capitalization stocks, sending the
benchmark Stock Exchange of Thailand index down 2.8 percent, to
283.92, its lowest level in 10-1/2 years.
	   In Hong Kong, higher domestic interest rates further depressed
investor sentiment and sent the benchmark index down for the third
straight day.
	   Adding to Wednesday's 4.9-percent loss, the blue-chip Hang Seng
Index ended down 93.30 points, or 1.2 percent, at 7,886.07, the
lowest level since Feb. 1995.
	   The index has lost 8.16 percent in the last three sessions.
	   In Taiwan, the benchmark Weighted Price Index ended at a
five-month low, closing 12.39 points lower at 7,210.74, as concerns
over the weak local currency dragged stocks down, analysts said.
	   But the New Taiwan dollar was pushed higher late Thursday by
heavy central bank intervention, estimated around dlrs 100 million.
	   In Manila, the Philippine peso and stocks plunged further, with
the key Philippine Stock Exchange Index dropping 4.6 percent to
1,829.02, its lowest level since January.
	   The peso averaged 40.319 pesos per dollar for the day, compared
to 39.775 pesos on Wednesday.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, share prices continued to fall, with the key
Composite Index finishing 1.4 percent lower at 483.00 points.
	   The Malaysian ringgit was mostly steady against the dollar in
late trading, after sliding to 4.0500 against the U.S. currency. It
was trading late Thursday at 3.9875 to the dollar, marginally up
from 3.9800 late Wednesday.
	   In Jakarta, the rupiah plunged in morning trading below the
psychologically important level of 14,000 against the U.S. dollar,
following an order from Bank Indonesia, the central bank, for banks
to settle their foreign exchange interbank debt and trade-finance
arrears by Thursday.
	   But it rebounded later on profit taking, trading at 13,750 to
the dollar, down from 13,450 late Wednesday.
	   In the stock market, late buying in stocks of state enterprises
pushed up the key JSX composite index, which closed up 3.464 points
at 411.544 points.
	   Investors said there was speculation that the govenment has
found strategic investors in some state-owned companies.
	   In Singapore, the stock market recovered somewhat the key index
plunged to a 9 1/2-year low Wednesday.
	   The key Straits Times Industrials Index closed 1.7 percent
higher at 1,086.83 points.
	   The Singapore dollar weakened further, briefly touching 1.75 to
the U.S. greenback before recovering to 1.7360 by late afternoon.
	   New Zealand shares also fell for the 11th straight session, with
the key index falling nearly 59 points, or 2.8 percent, closing at
2,008.78 points.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices fell for the eighth consecutive
day, with the key index closing 1.3 percent lower at 2.592.9
points.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed mixed, with the key index closing
4.16 points higher at 328.70 as investors settled massive amount of
June stock futures contracts by buying stocks, analysts said.

	   SAN JUAN DEL BOSQUE, Mexico (AP) _ In the two years that the
peace process has been frozen, the war in Chiapas essentially has
been carried out by proxy: Zapatista rebels and government troops
haven't fought, but their supporters repeatedly have clashed.
	   The government says that changed Wednesday when its forces
retook control of El Bosque, a municipality 25 miles (40
kilometers) north of San Cristobal that is sympathetic to rebels.
	   Nine people were killed including six that government officials
said were Zapatista fighters and one police officer. No information
was available about the other two victims, whose deaths were
announced late Wednesday by Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen.
	   Earlier, nine people were reported injured, including seven
police officers. Fifty-two people were arrested.
	   By early Thursday, peasants reported that police had left the
two communities where violence was the worst, Union Progreso and
Chabajebal. Officers still were patrolling the central square in
another area community, San Juan del Bosque.
	   Wednesday's clashes were among the deadliest since Zapatista
rebels' January 1994 uprising for Indian rights and greater
democracy.
	   A partial peace accord was signed in 1996, but peace talks have
broken down and tension has been rising. Supporters of both the
Zapatistas and the government repeatedly have attacked one another.
In December, pro-government paramilitaries killed 45 people in
Acteal, a hamlet of Zapatista supporters.
	   Zapatista sympathizers set up a rebel council in El Bosque 2-1/2
years ago. Members of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party
had their own council nearby and the two had appeared to coexist
peacefully.
	   The government said its forces were responding Wednesday only to
shots fired at them. Zapatista supporters say security forces fired
guns, destroyed houses and chased villagers.
	   An El Bosque resident who would identify himself only as Horacio
said residents opened fire after coming under attack.
	   ``The police shot first, launching grenades and then tear gas,''
Horacio said, choking back tears. ``Only when the people ... saw
their women and daughters lying on the ground, they grew desperate
and responded.''
	   Most of the fighting was in Chabajebal, where police said
fighters wearing the ski masks used by Zapatista rebels opened fire
on them with automatic weapons. The government said five people
killed in Chabajebal wore military-style uniforms similar to those
of the Zapatistas.
	   Several mountain ridges away, in a banana grove a two-hour walk
from Union Progreso, Manuela Gomez Gomez wept while her five
children slept on a plastic sheet beneath the full moon.
	   Mario Sanchez Perez, translating for the Tzotzil Indian woman,
said Gomez Gomez and 160 other rebel sympathizers fled Union
Progreso early Wednesday when it was surrounded by soldiers and
police.
	   Police, she said, forced a young man to put on a ski mask such
as those worn by rebel fighters and hold a rifle while they took
pictures.

U.S. labor secretary optimistic on child labor convention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said Thursday
she is ``optimistic about the outcome'' of discussions on a new
world convention aimed at abolishing the most extreme forms of
child labor.
	   She highlighted U.S. efforts to enforce child labor laws,
including this spring's Operation Salad Bowl, under which
inspectors were dispatched to 50 of the nation's farmlands.
	   ``We must start at home,'' Herman told the committee working on
the convention at the U.N. labor agency's annual conference. ``One
child working in abusive conditions is one too many.''
	   Countries are ``moving toward a common consensus on a resolution
that can be adopted,'' Herman told a news conference later.
	   The United States has moved to target ``areas where we know we
potentially could have problems'' in its own labor market, she
added.
	   International Labor Organization Director-General Michel
Hansenne and developing countries have said the new convention will
have to aim for realistic targets.
	   Some campaigners are calling for work that prevents children
receiving education to be classed as an extreme form of child
labor.
	   The ILO conference began last week with the arrival a global
march against child labor in Geneva. It ends next week.
	   ``Child labor will not cure poverty _ it is far more likely to
perpetuate it,'' Herman told the child labor committee.
	   ``We reject the claims of those who declare that in (child
labor's) absence, children face only two roads ... a road to
poverty, or a road to exploitation,'' she said. ``That is a false
choice.''

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Five dead and four injured
Russians who were in a helicopter crash in Antarctica arrived in
Cape Town aboard a ship, a shipping official said Thursday.
	   The Mi-8 helicopter crashed on June 1 shortly after taking off
from the Russian research vessel Akademik Fyodorov.
	   Four men who survived the crash with serious injuries were taken
immediately to Cape Town hospitals when the Fyodorov arrived
Wednesday, said John Douglas, operations manager for Combine
Oceans.
	   They are to be flown back to Russia after receiving medical
treatment. The bodies of the five who were killed in the crash will
be flown back as soon as arrangements are made.
	   The Fyodorov and its crew of over 200 is expected to depart
South Africa for its return journey next Tuesday, Douglas said.

World Cup: Six figure World Cup wager on Bulgaria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A 100,000-pound (dlrs 164,000) bet on Bulgaria to
beat Paraguay on Friday was the first six-figure wager on a single
World Cup game placed in Britain, bookmakers William Hill said
Thursday.
	   William Hill, which offered odds of 6-5 on Bulgaria beating
Paraguay, said a man placed the bet over the telephone from the
Mediterranean.
	   The man stands to win 120,000 pounds (dlrs 197,000) if Bulgaria
wins Friday, but his stake has dragged the odds on the team winning
the game down to even money.
	   A Paraguay win was offered at 12-5 and a draw at 2-1.
	   William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe said the first six-figure
bet on the tournament was a 120,000-pound (dlrs 197,000) wager on
the Netherlands winning the World Cup.
	   ``We're anticipating an industry betting turnover of more than
100 million pounds (dlrs 164 million) on the World Cup, and wagers
like these are already making that look a conservative estimate,''
he said.
	   Paraguay goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert, who also takes his
team's penalty kicks and free kicks, has attracted bets at 1,000-1
to be the World Cup's leading goal scorer.

Apartheid state investigated race-specific weapons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES grafs 13-14 with testimony from police scientist on
using illegal drugs for riot control &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The apartheid government
investigated the possibility of developing a bacteria that would
selectively kill or injure black people but leave white people
unharmed, a scientist said Thursday.
	   Speaking at a hearing of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, Daan Goosen described a search for an unnamed European
scientist alleged to know about a bacteria that would only hurt
blacks.
	   The information came from the military attache at the South
African Embassy in London in 1983 or 1984, Goosen said.
	   Goosen said reading scientific literature and journals led him
to believe it could be a feasible project, but he backed out of a
planned trip to London to find the scientist, fearing it could be a
trap.
	   The scientist said he had conducted the research on orders from
Dr. Wouter Basson, an army physician who set up a sophisticated
network of front companies to research biological and chemical
weapons. Goosen headed a covert military research laboratory under
Basson's control.
	   Goosen compared the search for the drug with U.S. President
Ronald Reagan's Star Wars project, an idea that Reagan had about
putting weapons into outer space to maintain world peace.
	   A selectively destructive bacteria could likewise have been used
domestically as a threat to keep the white government in power,
Goosen said.
	   ``A thing like this can be used to maintain peace,'' he said
``Peace means being the strongest power and this is the
strongest.''
	   Goosen admitted that hindsight showed his work was not
justifiable. But he said the prospect of keeping order amid an
increasingly resistant black population during apartheid's most
turbulent time gave impetus to Basson's work.
	   ``I was not thinking rationally at the time. Today I know I was
wrong. You can't do that to people, it is just not justifiable,''
Goosen said.
	   Since Monday, the panel that is investigating apartheid-era
crimes has also been hearing scientists describe working in a
poison factory that put deadly substances into drinks and
cigarettes that were passed onto apartheid hit squads.
	   Operatives considered poisoning President Nelson Mandela and
failed in an attempt to poison anti-apartheid cleric Frank Chikane,
now a top adviser to Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, by contaminating
his underwear.
	   Police forensic scientist Lothar Neethling testified Thursday
that Basson researched using drugs confiscated by police as a
method of riot control.
	   Neethling said he supplied Basson with up to 200,000 tablets of
mandrax, 5,000 tablets of LSD and 250 kilograms of marijuana
plants. The research aimed to turn the drugs into gas and put them
inside grenades. It failed to produce a viable product, Neethling
said.
	   The Truth Commission was set up by Mandela in 1995, a year after
South Africa's first all-race elections swept the African National
Congress into power and ended apartheid.
	   In a statement on Wednesday, the ANC compared the former
apartheid government with Adolf Hitler's Third Reich, which used
scientists to devise ways of exterminating millions of Jews,
Gypsies and others.

Moody's says Thai banks' bad debt will prolong economic crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ As much as dlrs 30 billion in bad loans
extended by Thai banks _ equal to one-quarter of Thailand's gross
domestic product _ may prove uncollectable, the U.S. credit-rating
agency Moody's Investors Service said in a report released
Thursday.
	   The possibility that Thailand's 16 commercial banks may have to
write off such a large sum bodes ill for an early recovery from the
country's economic slump, Moody's said.
	   The bad loans represent as much as a third of the gross book
value of the banks' loans.
	   It said its forecast would apply ``even if international
confidence returns to Thailand,'' and predicted its credit-ratings
for Thai banks would remain low.
	   Despite implementation of a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout program
supervised by the International Monetary Fund, there are few if any
indicators that Thailand has begun recovering from the shock of a
business downturn which snowballed into a financial crisis last
year.
	   Thai stock prices and the currency, after rising strongly in the
first few months of 1998, are sinking once more toward record lows.
Some major companies have begun to postpone repayment of foreign
debts, and only a handful of Thai financial institutions have
succeeded in raising fresh capital as planned.
	   Warning that Thailand is ``in the midst of the greatest economic
crisis in its modern history,'' Moody's said the inability of Thai
banks to raise new capital could impede economic recovery.
	   It said the Thai financial system needs a recapitalization of
more than dlrs 20 billion, which the banks cannot raise on their
own.
	   It predicted the government _ already running a budget deficit _
will soon have to choose between a number of unsatisfactory
alternatives to deal with the problem: inject its own cash into the
banks and help them recapitalize, shut down and liquidate insolvent
banks, or simply look the other way when banks fail to meet minimum
capital-adequacy standards.
	   ``These alternatives are not compatible with current government
plans for the reconstruction of the Thai banking system, implying
that significant changes in government policy will be required,''
Moody's said.
	   So far, only two Thai banks _ Bangkok Bank and Thai Farmers Bank
_ have been able to raise large amounts of recapitalization money
on their own, and even those banks still need additional capital,
Moody's said.
	   Two other banks _ Bank of Asia and Thai Danu Bank _ raised
smaller amounts by selling majority stakes to foreign banks, and
two other state-linked banks _ Krung Thai Bank and Thai Military
Bank _ raised funds by drawing on government or military
connections, Moody's said
	   Under the circumstances, Moody's said, the outlook for
Thailand's economy and its financial system remains bleak. It
predicted that the country's economic misery would be prolonged if
the banking system cannot be sufficiently recapitalized.

Police investigate Saudi king's brother for ill treating employees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian police are investigating a brother
of Saudi King Fahd and his wife for allegedly mistreating their
servants here and locking them up in a hotel room, officials said
Thursday.
	   The probe began after a Parliament deputy complained that two
Egyptian workers from his constituency were confined in a room in a
luxury hotel in Cairo on orders from Prince Turki and his wife.
	   The two men, who are domestic helps, also accused the prince's
French bodyguard of torturing them while they were imprisoned for
two days last week.
	   Turki, one of Fahd's seven brothers, has lived in Cairo since he
fell out with the king about 16 years ago. He rents three floors in
a 5-star hotel for his family and entourage.
	   The two men, who are domestic help, were punished because they
complained to Turki that his wife had not given them any day off in
six months, said the police officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Police freed the servants on Saturday after other employees
informed their families, who then complained to the police.
Detectives are now questioning the French bodyguard, officials
said.
	   Complaints of high-handed behavior by bodyguards of visiting
Saudi royalty are common but the government usually ignores them to
avoid embarrassing publicity.
	   Last month, Turki's bodyguards allegedly beat up the Egyptian
husband of an American hairdresser who worked for the prince's
wife. Later, Egypt deported the hairdresser after the prince
claimed that the man visited the hairdresser in her hotel room
without permission.
	   In December, police arrested an American bodyguard of the prince
after he allegedly punched two men who objected to his blocking a
road with his car.
	   The opposition newspaper Al-Ahrar said Thursday that police
should not turn a blind eye to the complaints against Turki and his
bodyguard.
	   Police should put ``the dignity and safety of the Egyptians as
their priority '' and not how much money Saudi tourists spend in
Egypt, Al-Ahrar said.
	   Three of the prince's bodyguards, including an American, were
deported from Egypt in 1995 over similar incidents.

Milosevic will meet Yeltsin in Moscow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Milosevic to visit Moscow in 1st 2 grafs, edits
to conform. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic will meet
with President Boris Yeltsin during a two-day visit to Moscow next
week, the presidential press service said Thursday.
	   Yeltsin invited Milosevic to Russia to discuss the situation in
the Balkan region, including the crisis in Kosovo, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said. Milosevic will be in Moscow on Wednesday and
Thursday.
	   Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov discussed the
crisis over the telephone on the eve of Primakov's Friday talks
with his counterparts in the Group of Eight.
	   Russia firmly opposes options for military intervention being
considered by NATO. However, Moscow favors strengthened control
over Kosovo's borders with Albania and Macedonia, Foreign Ministry
officials said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Primakov is expected to present these views during a meeting in
London with foreign ministers of the G-8 nations. No details of his
conversation with Yeltsin were disclosed.
	   NATO is considering military intervention to stop Serbian
attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The alliance has also
considered options for indirectly pressuring Milosevic, who is
blamed for the attacks.
	   Yeltsin has said that he would try to use his influence on
Milosevic, but that he remains firmly against NATO intervention.
Russia is also unlikely to support a ban on investment in Serbia
and a freeze of its foreign assets, Primakov has said.
	   More than 250 people have died in Kosovo during clashes between
government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of
the Albanian independence movement.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of the southern
province's population, are demanding independence from Serbia, the
dominant republic of the two left in the Yugoslav federation.

IFC to invest dlrs 247 million in South Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A World Bank sister organization said
Thursday it will invest dlrs 247 million in loans and other
assistance to help bolster South Korea's troubled banking sector.
	   The International Finance Corporation hoped its investment will
encourage foreign investors to return to South Korea. An exodus of
foreign investors pushed the country to near bankruptcy late last
year before the International Monetary Fund came to its aid.
	   ``The approval of the projects ... was a vote of confidence in
Korea's long-term viability and a signal of IFC's commitment as
well as its belief in the quick recovery of Korean industry and
financial institutions,'' the IFC said in a news release.
	   The IFC, a World Bank arm that makes loans to developing
countries to stimulate growth, said it will provide South Korea's
Hana Bank with dlrs 152 million in loans and other credit lines.
	   It will invest dlrs 25 million in bonds of Korea Long Term
Credit Bank.
	   The IFC also promised dlrs 30 million in long-term loans for
small high-tech companies as well as guaranteeing dlrs 40 million
in trade financing that Japan's Sumitomo Bank provides to Korean
exporters.
	   South Korean banks are desperately seeking foreign investment to
help rebuild their depleted capital base. They have been crippled
by a wave of loan defaults since the country's economic crisis
began last year.
	   As the banks tighten their credit, thousands of companies have
gone bankrupt.
	   The IFC's commitment followed a dlrs 250 million investment
package that Commerzbank AG of Germany announced in May for Korea
Exchange Bank.

Israel's parliament unlikely to probe bridge disaster
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MASHA HERBST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
said Thursday it appeared Israel's parliament did not plan to
investigate the Maccabiah bridge collapse which claimed the lives
of four Australian athletes last year.
	   Alexander made the comment to reporters after meeting with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was non-committal
about an independent probe by parliament that has been proposed by
the families of victims.
	   ``I didn't get the impression in my discussions with the Prime
Minister that he was on the verge of establishing a parliamentary
investigation,'' Downer told reporters.
	   A government-appointed panel of engineers looked into the cause
of the collapse, which occurred during the Maccabiah games, an
Olympic-style competition that gathered Jewish athletes from around
the world.
	   The panel issued a scathing report that blamed the builders and
organizers, and a police investigation led to the trial currently
underway in Tel Aviv of five people including the bridge's engineer
and two contractors.
	   Netanyahu, who plans a trip to Australia in August, promised to
finish looking into the matter before he arrived, but left unclear
whether he would agree to demands for compensation for the families
of victims.
	   ``By the time I get to Australia, I'm sure we will have
completed our examination,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
	   Netanyahu described the bridge collapse as a tragedy and said
that while Israel had ``done a few things, it can do more, and we
have to do more.''
	   ``What we intend to do is plan to give as much ... assistance to
the families, to the victims of this tragedy, as we can.''
	   Downer told reporters that he believed Israel should sign the
Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, but he said the issue did not
come up in 45-minute meeting at the Prime Ministry.

Connors isn't interested in being ambassador of tennis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID DROSCHAK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RALEIGH, North Carolina (AP) _ With the interest in professional
tennis declining, the sport could use an ambassador like Jimmy
Connors.
	   However, the career leader in tournament victories is not
applying for the job _ and probably never will.
	   ``I'm a dead man in tennis, I'm a long gone, lost entity in the
game,'' Connors said prior to this week's dlrs 150,000 BTI
Champions over-35 event on the Nuveen Tour. ``Which is fine. I
think a lot of people would be very happy if I was pushed aside and
gone.''
	   The ``people'' Connors talked about Wednesday are the tennis
establishment, with whom Connors never had much of a love
relationship with when he starred in the 1970s and '80s.
	   ``They would be very happy if I would go quietly, and I am,''
said Connors, who added that he has no regrets in his career.
``Tennis was my life and my enjoyment when I played it and now that
is over. ...
	   ``I don't hang around tennis to sit up in the stands for people
to say, `Oh, there is Jimmy Connors, he was a great player in the
'70s.' I don't need that. I was never an establishment kind of guy.
I more or less did my own thing.''
	   Connors, 46, is not alone in his indifference to watching a
sport on television he helped popularized two decades ago.
	   Eddie Dibbs, a close friend of Connors who won 22 singles events
when he played on the ATP Tour, said large purses and the speed of
the game _ with serves up to 130 mph (209 kph) _ have led to a
stale environment that often bores today's spectators.
	   ``The guys had better personalities back then and they were a
little friendlier with each other,'' said Dibbs, who won a
first-round match Wednesday night over Guillermo Vilas. ``Being in
the locker room was having fun with the guys. The guys were always
fooling around and I don't know if that's there now.''
	   No one had a better personality with the fans than Connors, who
won a record 109 singles events. His fist-waving salutes after key
rallies became his staple and made him a huge favorite at most
venues.
	   ``(Tennis) lost a huge personality when he left the game,''
Dibbs said of Connors' retirement in the early '90s. ``People
followed him all over. People are just attracted to him. He has a
way with the crowds and everything that no other people know how to
do.''
	   Connors, who was to play Thursday night against Gene Mayer,
believes the change in equipment has also led to a more even _ and
less entertaining _ playing field.
	   He still calls his greatest moment the 1991 U.S. Open tournament
in which he reached the semifinals at the age of 39 _ an unlikely
scenario for one of today's players.
	   ``What that did was give me what I had been trying to do my
whole career in tennis and that was having 20,000 people sound like
60,000,'' Connors said. ``That's what I always tried to bring to
tennis, and yet that's what I got criticized for my whole career.''

Canada challenges World Court's jurisdiction in fisheries dispute
</HEADLINE>
with Spain &QL; 
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ While respecting the World Court's
authority, Canada said Thursday the U.N. court lacks the
jurisdiction to settle its fisheries dispute with Spain.
	   Canada presented its case before the court on the third day of
hearings to determine whether judges have the authority to hear the
1995 turbot dispute between the two nations.
	   Canada said although it respects the court's jurisdiction in
other cases, legal proceedings are not the most appropriate way to
settle this specific conflict.
	   ``Canada simply opted to use a ... channel of negotiation to
find a settlement to certain disputes,'' said Philippe Kirsch,
Canada's agent.
	   The conflict centers on Canada's highly-publicized seizure of
the Spanish fishing vessel Estai in international waters on March
9, 1995.
	   Canadian officials claimed the boat was fishing endangered
turbot and using small-mesh gear, as well as underreporting its
catch.
	   At issue is the Canadian Coastal Fisheries Protection Act which
allowed authorities to venture outside its 200-nautical-mile limit
and arrest the Spanish trawler.
	   Spain, which presented its arguments earlier this week,
dismissed the legislation and described the seizure as ``armed
coercion.''
	   Spain also said the incident in the Grand Banks off Newfoundland
infringed its sovereignty since the Estai was sailing under its
flag. It has demanded compensation.
	   But Canada responded by saying Spain exaggerated the facts.
	   ``The arrest of the Estai happened without a loss of life,''
said Kirsch.
	   ``There was also no serious bodily harm. The vessel was never a
target, all shots were warning shots,'' he added.
	   Kirsch maintained that drastic measures on the high seas were
necessary to halt overfishing of straddling fish stocks.
	   ``Chronic overfishing and other fishing practices carried out by
Spain have left a profoundly bitter taste on both sides of the
Atlantic,'' added Kirsch.
	   This round of hearings focuses only on the court's jurisdiction
and not on the actual merits of the case.
	   The court, officially known as the International Court of
Justice, is the U.N.'s highest judicial body.

IMF said to demand Russian budget cuts, tax reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund has demanded that
Russia slash its budget deficit and reform its tax system in order
to qualify for billions of dollars in new loans, a top Western
banking official said Thursday.
	   Both actions are already goals of the Russian government,
although perhaps not to the extent envisioned by the IMF.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed a
report in The New York Times saying the IMF has told Russia it must
cut its budget deficit to 2.5 percent of its gross domestic product
and reform its tax policies.
	   The current deficit foreseen by the government this year is 4.5
percent. However, the new government of Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko has been moving in the past couple of weeks to cut
spending in an effort to further reduce the deficit.
	   The government is also pushing a tax reform package that is
stuck in the State Duma, the Communist-dominated lower house of
Parliament.
	   According to The Times, the IMF wants that measure passed before
the Duma recesses next month, and also wants a new code on
budgetary procedure passed.
	   In addition, the newspaper said, citing unidentified Kremlin
aides, the IMF called for Russia's Central Bank to be more open
about its activities and statistics, and for a breakup of Gazprom,
the huge national energy company, into separate pipeline and gas
extraction operations.
	   Since Russia's financial markets collapsed late last month,
there has been growing speculation that the country is seeking
additional dlrs 5 billion to dlrs 10 billion in loans from the IMF
or the Group of Eight leading industrial countries.
	   The Russian stock market perked up last week on rumors of an
emergency bailout plan. They have since slumped again, but trading
has mostly been light as investors wait to see what the West will
do.

Foreigners flee Guinea-Bissau ahead of government attack on rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Hundreds of foreigners prepared to flee
the West African country of Guinea-Bissau on Thursday as government
forces prepared to crush a rebellion led by renegade soldiers,
officials said.
	   The estimated 700 evacuees, including Portuguese, French and
Americans, were to be taken from the capital Bissau by a Portuguese
merchant ship, a spokesman for the Portuguese defense ministry said
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Bissau's airport has been closed since Sunday when an unknown
number of rebels, led by former armed forces chief Brig. Gen.
Ansumane Mane, launched their coup attempt.
	   Since then, the rebels have been pinned in a military garrison
in the suburb of Bra, six kilometers (four miles) outside the
capital.
	   Hundreds of troops from neighboring Senegal and the Republic of
Guinea arrived to support the government Tuesday and were deployed
around Bra, according to the Portuguese news agency Lusa.
	   At least 30 soldiers have been killed in sporadic fighting which
has paralyzed the capital, Lisbon radio TSF reported.
	   In a statement read on a private Bissau radio station late
Wednesday, the rebels claimed to have more than 2,000 heavily-armed
men, Lusa reported.
	   Talks planned for Wednesday between the rebels and a delegation
of lawmakers were called off when President Joao bernardo Vieira
said he couldn't guarantee the delegation's safety.
	   Mane, describing himself as head of the self-proclaimed Military
Junta for the Consolidation of Democracy, Peace and Justice, has
accused Vieira of corruption and called on the government to step
down.
	   The government has rejected the call for early elections, saying
legislative elections will go ahead as scheduled this year and a
presidential election will be held in 1999.
	   Mane was fired as armed forces chief in January amid allegations
he was involved in smuggling arms to separatist rebels in Senegal's
Casamance region.
	   Mane formally stepped down last Saturday.

McGuire takes first round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KOBE, Japan (AP) _ Marnie McGuire of New Zealand shot a
four-under-par 68 Thursday and took the one-stroke first round lead
in the 50 million yen (dlrs 352,000) Suntory Ladies Open golf
tournament.
	   The 29-year-old McGuire, winner of the 1986 All England Women
amateur championships, carded six birdies and two bogeys on the
6,346-yard, par-72, Arima Royal Golf Club course in Kobe, western
Japan.
	   ``I could play well today. My putting was particularly good,''
said McGuire, who won four Japan LPGA tournaments in the past four
years.
	   One stroke behind McGuire at 69 were two Japanese _ veteran
Nayoko Yoshikawa and Keiko Suzuki.
	   Ayako Shibata of Japan shot 70 and placed fourth.
	   Ai-sook Kim and Young-mee Lee, both of South Korea, shot 71s and
tied with eight Japanese for fifth place.
	   A total of 132 golfers, including 12 non-Japanese teed off in
cloudy weather.
	   Kaori Hara of Japan, who leads the money earning list with two
victories this season, shot 74 and tied 43th place with 12 other
Japanese.
	   The winner will pocket 9 million yen (dlrs 63,000).

British utility to use wood to make electricity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ It may sound primitive, but a British utility said
Thursday it envisions wood as an important fuel of the future.
	   Yorkshire Water PLC is leading the construction of a 28 million
pound (dlrs 46 million) plant to be fueled by specially grown
willows, as well as branches and stumps loggers leave behind in the
forest.
	   The plant will be the first such generator to operate
commercially in the world, said Keith Pitcher, project manager for
a joint venture called Arbre Energy Ltd., using the French word for
``tree.''
	   Yorkshire Water's partners are TPS Termiska Processer of Sweden,
which developed the technology, and The Royal Schelde Group of the
Netherlands, which will maintain the plant.
	   The generator in Eggborough, South Yorkshire, will provide
electricity for 18,000 people _ consuming wood at the rate of about
2 and one-third tons per person per year.
	   Yorkshire Water believes more power could be created by growing
the hardy willows on scrubby land with little other commercial
value, and that the technology could prove important as nations
seek to cut emissions of greenhouse gases believed responsible for
global warming.
	   ``It is one of the most environmentally benign ways to generate
electricity,'' Yorkshire Water chief executive Kevin Bond said.
	   The woodchips will be placed in a big steel container and
converted at extremely high heats into gas that will run turbines
to make electricity.
	   The wood-fueled gas is only half as powerful as coal gas, or a
10th as powerful as natural gas. But Yorkshire Water executives
note that the trees can be grown in three years, compared with the
millions of years it takes for the Earth to make non-renewable
fossil fuels that produce greenhouse gases.
	   The growing willows will consume exactly the same amount of
carbon dioxide that will be emitted by the plant, making it ``CO2
neutral,'' Bond said.
	   Burning trees for fuel might sound like an idea that would put
the utility executives on a collision course with
environmentalists, but not so.
	   Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace U.K. said Thursday they
support the effort. It should help Britain meet its target of
getting 10 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2010,
compared with the current 2 percent.
	   But Yorkshire Water cautioned the plant has to work financially
as well as environmentally _ which is no sure thing.
	   The European Union is providing a 10 million pound (dlrs 16
million) grant, and Britain's Department of Trade and Industry
helped by ensuring electricity companies will buy power from the
plant for at least 15 years.
	   ``We hope it will become profitable and commercially viable,''
said Thomas Korsfalt, director general of the Swedish National
Energy Authority. ``One of the objectives is to lower the costs.''

Report: Israel and India trade military intelligence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Israel is providing India with intelligence on
Pakistan from its spy satellite, according to a political affairs
newsletter published by Jane's Information Group.
	   In return, India has given permission for Israeli military
intelligence experts to undertake missions on Indian territory,
Foreign Report said in its latest issue published Wednesday.
	   Despite last month's nuclear tests by India and then Pakistan,
the weekly publication predicted that Israeli-Indian military
cooperation will continue.
	   Foreign Report said Israel's military cooperation with India is
on three levels: the Mossad spy agency, the military intelligence
organization known as AMAN, and the Ministry of Defense which is
trying to sell Israeli arms to India.
	   There is little cooperation among the three services, it said,
citing bureaucratic rivalry between AMAN and Mossad.
	   AMAN provides India with fresh data about Pakistan gathered by
Israel's Ofek spy satellite, Foreign Report said.
	   Three years ago, Israel launched Ofek-3 which, according to
foreign reports, has also provided information on Iran, Iraq and
Syria. The first Ofek _ the word means ``horizon'' in Hebrew _ was
launched in 1988, followed by Ofek-2 in 1990. Ofek-4 was launched
in January but failed to enter orbit.
	   Foreign Report said in return for the Ofek intelligence, India
has given permission for Unit 8200, comprising AMAN's special
monitoring experts, to monitor points of interest from Indian
territory.
	   Mossad's main aim in cooperating with India is to find out as
much as possible about what Israel calls the ``Islamic bomb''
tested by Pakistan, the newsletter said.
	   ``Israel worries about leaks of expertise from Pakistan to other
Islamic states. However, we have been told that no evidence was
unearthed about Iranian attempts to acquire Pakistani know-how
about nuclear weapons,'' Foreign Report said.

 &UR; Lull in fighting as world weighs military and political action
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Amid a lull in fighting in Serbia's
secessionist province of Kosovo, NATO weighed military options
Thursday while Britain's most senior diplomat urged both sides to
compromise and strongly suggested Kosovo should regain autonomy.
	   No fighting was reported by either side Thursday, although
skirmishes between heavily armed Serbian police and soldiers and
the ethnic Albanian militants of the Kosovo Liberation Army have
become a daily occurrence.
	   More than 250 people have been killed since police began a
crackdown in March on militants in the province, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-1, and have been ruled repressively
since Serbia stripped Kosovo of broad autonomy in 1989.
	   NATO allies, increasingly worried that a lack of action will
send violence spiraling out of control in the southern Balkans, met
Thursday in Brussels and weighed an immediate show of firepower to
deter Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic from further military
action in Kosovo.
	   ``If it requires military action or the use of some of the
military options to get him to see sense then that is after all
what we are here to do,'' British Defense Secretary George
Robertson told the British Broadcasting Corp. before the meeting.
	   Tony Lloyd, No. 2 in Britain's Foreign Office, met Albanian
leaders in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, and afterwards urged both
secessionists and Serbian authorities to compromise.
	   ``There has to be a negotiating process...to stop the bloodshed.
We made it clear that we endorse negotiations for autonomy for the
people, the Albanians in Kosovo,'' Lloyd said.
	   He had met previously with top officials of Serbia-dominated
Yugoslav federation in Belgrade.
	   Lloyd blamed the government for most of the violence, but said
``our condemnation is equally about violence by the KLA in
Kosovo.''
	   Serbia vows never to allow secession of Kosovo, historically the
cultural heartland of the state.
	   ``The outside world expects a compromise certainly from
President Milosevic and certainly as well from the extreme
aspirations (for independence) that are expressed in Kosovo,''
Lloyd said.
	   Talks between the sides began last month under Western pressure,
but have made no progress and were suspended last week as the
Albanians protested a Serbian government offensive in western
Kosovo.
	   Terse comments from Yugoslav officials after their meetings with
Lloyd indicated no change in the government stand, and the
Albanians seemed equally unbudging.
	   ``Our stand in any talks is the option for independent Kosovo,''
said Fehmi Agani, who met Lloyd in Pristina.
	   As on Wednesday, there were no fresh reports of fighting.
Milosevic _ and the KLA _ appear to be waiting to see what
international action is taken over Kosovo.

World cup: Organizers threaten legal action over ticket scams
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French organizers said Thursday they were prepared
to sue anyone involved in World Cup ticket scams and insisted that
all their tickets had been distributed according to signed
contracts.
	   Bruno Travade, a spokesman for the World Cup organizing
committee, said he could not explain the circumstances that led
some 12,000 Japanese fans who purchased ticket plans to still be
without their stadium passes.
	   He said representatives of the only three licensed ticket
agencies for Asia _ JT Travel, Ken R Tours and Prime Sports
International _ picked up their tickets at the organizers' Paris
headquarters between April 27-29.
	   ``We have the receipts, signed by representatives of the tour
operators, that they collected the number and classification of
tickets they had contracted for,'' Travade said.
	   Worldwide, he said, 138,000 tickets had been distributed to 17
licensed agencies. Other brokers who peddled World Cup tickets face
legal action, the spokesman said.
	   ``We will sue anyone or any organization who undertakes to
damage our image or intentions,'' Travade said. ``And we encourage
individuals to sue the persons who cheated them.''
	   Five Japanese travel agencies decided to cancel their World Cup
tours for Japan's opening match against Argentina because they fear
they won't receive the tickets in time, Kyodo news reported. Other
major tour operators said they may be forced to cancel as well, and
some said they have considered using the black market to acquire
missing tickets.

Voter registration for Cambodian polls expected to pass 90 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The number of eligible Cambodians
who have registered to vote in July's election has surpassed the 80
percent mark and is expected to top 90 percent when the
registration process ends next week, an election official said
Thursday.
	   A spokesman for the National Election Committee said that in
three weeks of registration, nearly four million people, or 80.45
percent of the 5.6 million people eligible to vote, had already
received voting cards.
	   ``Even if the registration won't realize the target, we still
hope that it will reach over 90 percent,'' said Prum Nhean Vichet,
who didn't specify the target figure. ``This should satisfy our
donors.''
	   Some foreign aid donors and other concerned parties have
expressed worries that the election, scheduled for July 26, may not
be free and fair. They charge that the government of Hun Sen, who
overthrew his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a
coup d'etat last year, has arranged the election rules and
infrastructure to its own advantage.
	   The European Union has agreed to give more than dlrs 10 million
in election aid for Cambodia. The United States, more skeptical
about the prospects for a fair election, will give only dlrs 2.3
million and channel the funds strictly through non-governmental
organizations.
	   An EU representative said last month that the grouping has set
no ``benchmarks'' which the Cambodian government must meet to
receive election aid, but will make judgments on the fairness of
the coming polls ``as we go along.''
	   Derek Fatchett, British Minister of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs and Special Representative of the EU
Presidency, said after a visit to Cambodia that the voter
registration process was one indicator of fairness being watched by
the EU.
	   If the number of people registering fell far short of those
eligible, it would raise concern, Fatchett said at a May 29 news
conference in Bangkok, Thailand.
	   Election official Prum Nhean Vichet said Thursday that
registration, which began May 18, will close on June 15 as planned.
	   He said that 1,723,391 people registered during the first week
of registration, 1,534,266 in the second week and 688,132 during
the third weeks.
	   Prum Nhean Vichet said that the number of registered voters in
Anlong Veng, the former stronghold of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla
group, was not yet available.
	   Several thousand people, guerrillas and their families, have
defected from the group since April, all but sounding its death
knell. The defectors, said to total about 20,000, were last week
officially welcomed back into the government fold.

Israeli Arab sentenced for attack on British teens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli Arab was sentenced Thursday to 20
years in prison for ramming his car into a crowd of British
teenagers last year, Israel Radio reported.
	   Bakr Abu Rabiya, from the northern Israel town of Nazareth, was
convicted in Jerusalem Magistrates' Court of attempted murder for
the July 1997 attack on a group of 40 teenagers touring the Old
Jaffa section of Tel Aviv. None of the teens was seriously hurt.
	   After ramming his car into the crowd, Abu Rabiya got out and
chased some of the teenagers with a sword, then stabbed a Canadian
mother and daughter eating at a sidewalk cafe.
	   ``During the past year, I've been dreaming about it, thinking
about it every night,'' said 17-year-old Graham Kogan of Redbridge,
England, who returned to Israel for the sentencing.
	   ``I can still see him trying to stab me, trying to cut me.''
	   Abu Rabiya allegedly told police that he had had carried out the
attack as revenge for an Israeli woman's flier depicting the
Islamic Prophet Mohammed as a pig.
	   Defense lawyer Josef Aharonson said Abu Rabiya's sentence was
far stiffer than those given to Jews convicted of similar crimes.
	   ``The basic question is _ when there are attacks by Jews,
attempts at murder, do they get the same sentence?'' he asked on
Israel Radio.

Marcos to be buried at military cemetery without honors in July
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Former dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who
died in exile in Hawaii in 1989, will finally be buried at a Manila
military cemetery next month without state honors, his widow said
Thursday.
	   Imelda Marcos said she has tentatively set the burial at the
Heroes' Cemetery for July 11.
	   ``All my husband wanted was to be buried with his brothers-in
arms,'' said Mrs. Marcos. ``Nothing more.''
	   Mrs. Marcos had previously stated she wanted full state honors
for her husband because he had served in the military and also as
president.
	   Many Filipinos, including people who suffered human rights
abuses during Marcos' 20-year rule, have opposed Mrs. Marcos'
demand.
	   Marcos loyalist and lawyer Oliver Lozano said Mrs. Marcos
relented to avoid possible protests.
	   Marcos was ousted in a ``people power'' revolt in 1986 and fled
to Hawaii, where he died three years later. His body was returned
to the Philippines in 1992 and kept in an air-conditioned glass
crypt in his hometown of Batac in Ilocos Norte province.
	   Outgoing President Fidel Ramos and his predecessor, Corazon
Aquino, refused to allow Marcos to be buried at the Heroes'
Cemetery, fearing possible clashes between Marcos loyalists and
opponents.
	   President-elect Joseph Estrada, a former Marcos supporter who
takes office June 30, has said it is time for Filipinos to bury
their past and reconcile.
	   ``I have already made up my mind,'' Estrada said Thursday. ``He
will be buried as a guerrilla, a veteran and former
commander-in-chief.''
	   The Heroes' Cemetery is a burial ground for soldiers, regardless
of record. Aside from soldiers, two former presidents are buried
there.
	   In an editorial Thursday, the independent newspaper Today asked
Estrada to reconsider his decision.
	   ``Please Mr. president-elect, don't think that the millions of
Filipinos victimized by the Marcoses will just sit and watch you
and the dictator's heirs pour salt into their wounds,'' it said.
``It's very painful to bear.''

First round of European GP called of by torrential rain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SLALEY, England (AP) _ Torrential overnight rain washed out
Thursday's start of the European Grand Prix at the Slaley Hall, a
course sodden by weeks of bad weather.
	   Tournament organizers, borrowing water pumps from nearby courses
to clear water from the fairways and bunkers, finally decided to
postpone the start until Friday.
	   Plans call for 18 holes on Friday and Saturday with a 36-hole
final Sunday in the 650,000-pound (dlrs 1.06 million) event in
northeast England.
	   ``We have had horrendous rainfall in the last two weeks
throughout the area,'' said local tournament director Nigel Gough.
	   PGA European Tour officials, hoping to save the tournament, had
50 volunteers battling the weather Thursday and hoped to have 150

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli security guard was stabbed Thursday
in an argument with a Palestinian family over an archaeological dig
in a contested Jerusalem neighborhood, police said.
	   The guard was slightly injured, police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby
said. Several Palestinians were arrested, but the attacker got
away, he said.
	   The scuffle took place in the Silwan neighborhood next to
Jerusalem's Old City, one of several Arab neighborhoods in east
Jerusalem settlers have targeted in their campaign to expand the
Jewish presence in the city. The family lives next to the Israeli
dig, which has been going on for several years, Ben-Ruby said.
	   Earlier in the week, settlers moved into five apartments in
Silwan under cover of darkness, setting off shouting and shoving
matches with Arab neighbors.
	   Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the
1967 Mideast War, as a future capital, and see Israeli expansion
into Arab neighborhoods as preempting peace talks on the final
status of the city.
	   Also Thursday, Israeli troops bulldozed the home of a
Palestinian family in the West Bank town of Hebron that had been
twice rebuilt after earlier demolitions. Scuffles broke out between
the soldiers and family members and neighbors, who threw stones and
bottles.
	   Israeli peace activists had helped rebuild the Atrash family's
home in March, after it was razed on grounds that it was built
without a permit. It was demolished once before in 1988, on the
same grounds.
	   The house is built near an Israeli bypass road that is intended
to allow Jewish settlers and other Israelis to travel through the
West Bank without entering Palestinian towns.
	   Ten people lived in the house.
	   Zahour Atrash, 38, shouted for help as the house was torn down,
and vowed ``We will take revenge.''
	   Mrs. Atrash said the family would rebuild the house again.
	   The Palestinians say Israel refuses to issue building permits in
areas of the West Bank it wants to keep under its control. Israel
says the demolitions are legitimate means of enforcing zoning
regulations.

Gadhafi survived gun attack, travelers say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was slightly
wounded in an armed attack last week that killed one of his female
bodyguards, Libyans arriving in Egypt said Monday.
	   The attack happened June 1 on a coastal road in eastern Libya
when Gadhafi was on his way to Egypt for an official visit, the
travelers said.
	   The account could not be independently confirmed and diplomats
in Tripoli, the Libyan capital, said they hadn't heard of the
incident. One European diplomat could only confirm that Gadhafi was
in eastern Libya last week.
	   Gadhafi had stopped on the road near the town of Dirnah when
suspected Muslim militant opened fire at him and his group from
surrounding mountains, said the travelers, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Gadhafi was injured in the elbow, said the travelers contacted
by telephone in the Egyptian border town of Salum.
	   The Libyans, some of whom witnessed the attack, said Gadhafi's
top bodyguard, Aisha, was shot dead when she shielded the leader.
	   Some seven other guards were seriously wounded in the attack,
the witnesses said. It was not clear if any others died.
	   Gadhafi was scheduled to visit Egypt for nine days beginning
June 2, but the trip was postponed to June 5. No explanation was
given and even the second visit was postponed. President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt said it was put off because Gadhafi had
tonsillitis.
	   The London-based Liberty for the Muslim World, a human rights
groups which monitors Libyan affairs, also reported that Gadhafi
was attacked ``in the past few days.'' But it had no details.
	   The group said that at least 100 men between 16 to 20 years have
been arrested since the attack in Dirnah, and the nearby towns of
Ras al-Helal, and al-Qubbah.
	   The three towns lie in the al-Jabal al-Akhdar region, a
mountainous area whose caves offer numerous hideouts. The region is
a stronghold of militants trying to depose him.
	   The Libyan travelers said police are conducting searches at
checkpoints along the coast from the city of Benghazi to the
Egyptian border.
	   Dirnah, which lies about 250 kilometers (160 miles) west of the
Egyptian border, has been a site of clashes between Gadhafi's
forces and Muslim militant insurgents.

Drug traffickers arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Police arrested two German
nationals early Thursday on charges of drug trafficking and seized
thousands of shots of cocaine, police officials said.
	   The two men are suspected of heading an international ring that
smuggles drugs between Brazil and Germany, said Ivana Moosova, a
police spokeswoman in Prague. One of the men was arrested in
Germany and the other in a Prague hotel.
	   Moosova said 4,000 shots of cocaine were seized in the hotel
room, each weighing from 0.5 to 1 gram. The cocaine was meant to
test the market in the Czech Republic, where addicts have
multiplied almost threefold in the past five years, police
officials said.
	   In 1997, police arrested 130 people _ 29 of them foreigners _ on
drug-related charges and seized drugs worth more than 1 billion
koruna (dlrs 28.5 million), according to Jiri Komorous, head of the
Czech anti-narcotics squad.
	   Moosova said the 42-year-old man arrested in Prague, whom she
identified only as J. G., will be extradited to Germany.

U.N. makes second urgent plea for helicopters to aid quake victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The United Nations pleaded for more
helicopters Thursday to deliver aid to thousands of victims of a
devastating earthquake that shattered northern Afghanistan.
	   The appeal -- the second since the May 30 quake -- was
accompanied by a harsh attack on the international community, which
has promised 10 more helicopters but hasn't delivered one.
	   ``This is unbelievably frustrating,'' said Alfredo
Witschi-Cestari, the U.N. coordinator for humanitarian aid to
Afghanistan. ``In fact, it's scandalous given that so many lives
are at stake.''
	   In the remote villages of Afghanistan tens of thousands of
people are still sleeping outdoors too frightened of another
earthquake to venture inside. Most of them have no access to clean
water and their food supplies are rapidly running out.
	   In some villages, people are totally dependent on international
aid, say relief workers.
	   While a final death toll will not be known for several months,
humanitarian workers say that as many as 5,000 people were killed
when the quake struck, triggering landslides, flattening homes and
burying hundreds of people.
	   The United Nations and International Red Cross ferried tons of
supplies to Faisabad, the provincial capital of northern Badakhshan
province, barely 70 kilometers (45 miles) from the epicenter of the
6.9 magnitude quake.
	   The supplies have been stacking up on the Faisabad runway
because aid agencies have not had the helicopters they need to
reach remote villages.
	   ``We desperately need the extra helicopters,'' said
Witschi-Cestari.
	   Several private firms have signed contracts promising the
helicopters and Witschi-Cestari said the United Nations has raised
the money to pay the costly rental rates and fuel costs.
	   But so far the firms have not delivered.
	   ``Deals have been agreed, contracts made, and still, eleven days
after the earthquake, only a tiny fleet of helicopters is
operating,'' he said.
	   The Russian government said that it was ready to send two
helicopters loaded with humanitarian aid to Afghanistan for the Red
Cross.
	   According to the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations a
cargo helicopter left Siberia for Duchambe in Tajikistan on
Thursday. A second transport helicopter will arrive in neighboring
Tajikistan on Friday. Both helicopters will leave for Afghanistan
on Saturday.
	   The helicopters will cost the Red Cross and the U.N. dlrs 800 to
1,000 an hour.

World Cup: Sheffield Wednesday denies deal with French coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ Sheffield Wednesday is still
interviewing candidates and has not offered its manager's job to
South Africa's World Cup coach Philippe Troussier, the club said
Thursday.
	   Wednesday chairman David Richards said the South Yorkshire club
was still talking to potential replacements for Ron Atkinson and
Troussier, a Frenchman, was one of the candidates.
	   Richards said the number of applications for the vacant Owls
manager job had exceeded expectations and interviews would
continue.
	   ``We are interviewing like normal people would interview. We
want the best candidate for Sheffield Wednesday,'' he told BBC
Radio.
	   Club secretary Graham Mackrell said he could ``state
categorically'' that Troussier had not been offered the job at
Hillsborough.
	   ``And as a club, we are not going to be put under pressure by
external forces. We will make the appointment when we are ready to
make the appointment,'' he said.
	   On Wednesday, Troussier said he had been offered the job after
Richards met with him in France.
	   ``He (Richards) drove for four hours from Paris to our base. We
had a 10-minute meeting and I'm very happy that I'm going to
Hillsborough,'' the former French international was quoted as
saying in British newspapers.
	   Troussier, who has been in charge of the South African team for
three months, said he planned to take a new vision for Sheffield
Wednesday.
	   ``There are many good players in the African continent and I
might even bring some of them with me,'' he said.

NATO not welcome among Albanians near the Yugoslav border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN MURPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PADESH BORDER POST, Albania (AP) _ An Albanian guard adjusted
his binoculars and peered down the steep valley at a convoy of
Serbian military vehicles on the other side of the border.
	   ``That's where NATO should send their soldiers,'' Pvt. Perparim
Kulici said. ``Why Albania? They should go where there is
violence.''
	   As NATO officials convened in Brussels to try to organize NATO
air exercises in Albania and Macedonia, Albanians and their kin in
the separatist Serbian province of Kosovo were not rolling out the
welcome mat.
	   They believe that foreign troops in Albania would benefit the
Serbs by strangling the ability of the ethnic Albanian separatists
to funnel weapons and supplies from Albania into Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's
population, are demanding independence from Serbia, the dominant
republic of the two in the Yugoslav federation.
	   Some military planners contend that the local hostility to
outside forces fails to consider that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic might otherwise bring his battle across the border into
Albania.
	   Without a show of military resolve by the West, Milosevic may
see an ``open door'' to eventually take the conflict into Albania,
the source of arms for the rebels, said a Western military official
in Tirana who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   ``Signals are showing that a new Bosnia is coming up,'' warned
Ilir Meta, Albanian State Secretary for European Integration.
	   The Albanian government has pushed hard for an outside military
presence in its lawless northeastern frontier region, fearing not
only Serb aggression, but also looking for help to prevent Kosovo
Liberation Army supporters from looting Albanian armories and
police stations.
	   Western leaders have promised not to repeat past mistakes in the
Balkans and seek to quell the conflict before it spins out of
control.
	   If NATO does deploy in Albania and neighboring Macedonia, it may
couple that with threats of air strikes against the Serbs to
pressure them to stop their assaults on Kosovo Albanians.
	   In northeast Albania and Kosovo itself, local voices questioning
a possible military mission are being drowned out by calls for
action by NATO allies.
	   Some rebel militia men have even threatened to attack foreign
troops if they interfere with the supply routes to separatists in
Kosovo.
	   ``Why don't the troops intervene directly in Kosovo? The West is
trying to look strong, but instead it looks weak by coming to
Albania and not Kosovo, where people are dying,'' complained Ajim
Kulipi in the Albanian village of Tropoja, the first stop for many
of the estimated 10,000 refugees who have fled Kosovo to Albania.
	   But some Albanians see a NATO force as an important show of
power.
	   Besides overcoming local resistance, any possible outside ground
force would face huge logistical hurdles. The terrain is a maze of
razor-edged peaks and plunging valleys. The 20-kilometer (12-mile)
road from the provincial center of Bajram Curri to Tropoja is
little more than a rutted path in some places.
	   Military engineers would need more than a month just to make an
adequate road, said William Foxton, an observer with the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is
advising Western leaders on the conditions in the border region.

	   RESIDENTS of Jalan Seputeh (1) in Kuala Lumpur, worried over the
safety of children in the neighbourhood, have urged the authorities
to close the lane to heavy vehicles.
	   Jasbir Singh, who has been staying in the area for the past 15
years, said lorries and other heavy vehicles used the lane whenever
the Federal Highway was congested.
	   ``Lorries carrying construction materials speed along this lane,
not bothering about the safety of children who live here.
	   ``The drivers use this lane, which has no speed humps, as a
short cut to avoid congestion on the main road,'' he said.
	   Minibuses had also used the lane when they were on the road.
	   ``The drivers constantly honk to ensure oncoming vehicles do not
obstruct them. The honking really annoys residents,'' Jasbir Singh
added.
	   He claimed that work on the Mid-Valley project had also led to
lorries using the bypass.
	   ``Earlier, we never noticed the heavy vehicles as they were
careful when using the lane.
	   ``However, the drivers soon got familiar with the route and
started to speed, not caring for the safety of the residents.
	   ``Once, a long trailer carrying a tractor to the construction
site was seen speeding.
	   ``The driver did not bother to stop at the junction to give way
to oncoming vehicles but instead took a sharp turn and almost
rammed into a car which was negotiating a bend,'' Jasbir Singh
said.
	   David Achariam, who moved into the area six months ago, said he
was concerned about the safety of the children in the area,
especially those staying in squatter houses opposite his house.
	   ``Every evening, these children aged between four and 18 spend
their time along the lane either strolling, playing ball or
badminton.
	   ``Some of them are too young to be mindful of the passing heavy
vehicles. ``We are thankful that there have been no accidents so
far. We don't want such tragedy to happen right in front of our
eyes,'' he said.
	   ``As a preventive measure, we want the relevant authorities to
put a `No Entry' signboard to prevent heavy vehicles from using the
lane, especially during peak hours.
	   ``This lane is only meant for motorists staying around Taman
Seputeh and not for construction lorries carrying sand and
gravel,'' Achariam added.
	   Jalan Seputeh (1) also serves as an access road for cars going
to the nearby Mobil station located along the Federal Highway.
	   Brickfields police station spokesman S.M. Pakri police can only
issue summonses to drivers of heavy vehicles using the lane while
``No Entry'' signboards come under City Hall's jurisdiction.
	   Meanwhile, City Hall public relations officer Rosilawatie Rahmat
said action can only be taken after investigations are carried out.
	   ``Only after investigations will we be be able to take action
against lorry drivers who pose a danger to children and residents
in the area,'' she said.
	   On putting up ``No Entry'' signboards, she said it can only be
done after discussions senior City Hall officials.

	   FLOOD woes in Taman Sri Muda, Shah Alam will hopefully be a
thing of the past when flood mitigation programmes, jointly
undertaken by the Shah Alam Municipal Council and the Drainange and
Irrigation Department, are completed in September.
	   Council president Mohammad Adzib Mohd Isa said the first and
second phases of the project were completed last year.
	   ``The tidal gate which was completed last September has improved
the flood situation in Taman Sri Muda significantly,'' he said.
	   He said the third phase, which included the contruction of large
and small drains and retention ponds, was under the Selangor DID.
	   The first phase costs the council RM12.4 million while the
second phase, costing RM15 million, involves the construction of
additional bunds along main drains to prevent water from the river
entering the housing estate during high tide.
	   Speaking to reporters after the handing over of a clock tower in
Section 15 by the UMW Group to the council, Mohammad Adzib said the
council was going all out to prepare for the Commonwealth Games in
September.
	   He said the council received RM3 million from the Landscaping
Department to beautify Shah Alam for the event.
	   ``We are topping up that amount with another RM3 million to
ensure that the venues for the boxing and cycling events are not
only ready but presentable and up to standard.''
	   He said three major companies have also made contributions by
way of building monuments for the games.

Chechen government cracks down on oil thieves
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen police cracked down Thursday on
thieves who tap into a pipeline carrying Caspian Sea oil through
the breakaway republic to the rest of the world.
	   Chechen officials have said that illegal refineries stealing oil
from the pipeline are costing Chechnya millions of dollars a month.
Guards placed along the pipeline have not been able to stop the
thefts.
	   ``The oil thefts have acquired a massive scale threatening to
undermine the national economy,'' Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov
said in a decree ordering police to step up efforts to stop the
thieves.
	   More than 2,000 police are taking part in the operation that
began Wednesday. On Thursday, they fired assault rifles to destroy
21 illegal refineries near the town of Argun, 15 kilometers (9
miles) east of the capital, Grozny, and seized 18 tank trucks used
by thieves.
	   Russia, which is part of an international consortium developing
Azerbaijan's rich Caspian Sea oil reserves, has long pushed for the
oil to be transported to market through Chechnya to the Russian
Black Sea port of Novorossiisk.
	   Competing proposals call for the oil to be transported
eventually through Georgia, Ukraine or Turkey.
	   Caspian oil began running through Chechnya in 1997. In the first
quarter of 1998, 53.3 million gallons of crude oil were transported
through the pipeline, according to the Russian Transneft oil
pipeline company. There has been no word on how much oil was
stolen.
	   Since the end of 1994-96 war with Russia, Chechnya has been
plunged into lawlessness and authorities have been unable to fight
soaring crime. Moscow says that Chechnya remains part of Russia,
but Chechnya considers itself fully independent and runs its own
affairs.

China concerned about yen devaluation, confident on Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS 4th graf `If not ... ' to 140 billion, sted million

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China expressed concern Thursday that Japan's
weakening yen could destabilize still shaky financial markets
around Asia but was confident Hong Kong could withstand the
turbulence.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Hong Kong's local
government was taking effective measures to stimulate the economy
and stabilize sinking financial markets.
	   Those measures, plus the territory's dlrs 96 billion in foreign
exchange reserves, should be sufficient to maintain the Hong Kong
dollar's fixed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar, Zhu said.
	   If not, Zhu reiterated Beijing's readiness to use its dlrs 140
billion in foreign exchange reserves to support the 15-year peg.
China has repeatedly pledged to guarantee Hong Kong's prosperity
since it resumed control over the former British colony last July.
	   ``We are confident that the Hong Kong economy will move out of
the difficult situation,'' Zhu said at a routine media briefing.
	   Zhu, however, urged Japan to take action to halt the yen's slide
and prevent further harm to economies weakened by a year of
financial turbulence.
	   Worries about the weakening yen caused financial markets to
plunge throughout Asia Thursday. Hong Kong's market fell to a
three-year low Wednesday and its flagship Hang Seng Index hit a new
three-year low Thursday.
	   ``We believe the continued devaluation of the Japanese yen will
be not be conducive to the stabilization of financial markets in
East Asia,'' Zhu said.
	   The spokesman repeated China's pledge not to devalue its own
currency and thereby possibly provoke other countries to devalue
their currencies to remain competitive.

	   EVERYONE has heard of Federal Express Inc, a company conceived
by Fred Smith, a true entrepreneur who received a ``C'' grade from
his economics professor; he proved his professor wrong when his
idea became Federal Express, now a US$11 billion giant in express
delivery services which started a US$20-billion-plus industry.
	   Smith foresaw the advances in delivery that computers can bring;
he believes he got where he is because, ``in the history of most
entrepreneurial ideas ... the common denominator is that somebody
had a different perspective or a slightly different view'' of how a
business should operate.
	   Alfred Chandler, business history professor at Harvard
University, was first to suggest how decentralisation in a large
corporation could assist long-term growth, while allowing business
units and individuals to get on with the day-to-day. Edward
Demings, father of quality in manufacturing, originated the
revolutionary principle that all processes are vulnerable to loss
of quality through variation. This approach is firmly rooted in the
belief that quality is about people, not products. Such differences
in thought strategy made Japan overtake the world in manufacturing
excellence in the second half of the 20th century.
	   Some leaders' thought strategies have common threads: Beginning
The Day One must endeavour to begin the day in a good frame of
mind. This is especially true in this age of economic turbulence.
David Schwartz, author of Magic of Thinking Big, says of
leadership: ``Take time to confer with yourself and tap your
supreme thinking power ... The successful person uses solitude to
do his super-thinking''. A good practice is to spend time in your
office ... thinking. No paperwork, just think, give thanks to God,
and use this strategy to start the day.
	   Sharpen Your Saw Leaders must be sharp and fresh. This is
achieved through a process of renewal, called ``sharpening the
saw''. However, CEOs and senior managers - because they are so busy
- often neglect to sharpen their thinking.
	   W. Fusselman, a business leader, saw the importance of reading
in developing thought leaders. ``Today a reader ... tomorrow, a
leader'', he said.
	   John Welch, CEO of General Electric, said: ``Are you dealing
with new things? When do you find yourself regenerating? Are you in
a new environment, do you come up with a fundamentally different
approach? ...
	   Three or four times a year, I hop on a plane and visit something
like seven countries in 15 days. People say to me, ``Are you
nutty?'' ... No, I'm not nutty. I'm trying to regenerate.''
	   The Strategy Of Thought Leadership Is To Lead There is a
difference between the boss and the leader. The Boss says ``Go'',
the Leader says ``Let's go''. This is better illustrated by an
anonymous quote: ``A leader encourages, prods and helps others so
they may help themselves; asks, `How can we improve this?' when
others think it is the best; asks, `What do you think?', not
`Here's what I think'; stands alone, but steadfast, when others
submit to the mob; knows not the meaning of `I give up'; is friend
to all, but has few friends.''
	   If there is a problem in raising the level of leadership in your
organisation, one must train them or trade them! The Strategy Of
Thought Leadership Is To Orchestrate J. Ogden Armour, owner of a
conglomerate, once said: ``A business orchestra should be as
well-coordinated as a symphony orchestra.''
	   Communicate, Communicate, Communicate! I believe communication
is a vital part of thought leadership. This is best illustrated by
the example of who discovered America. The Chinese, Scandinavians
and Italians disagree about the identity of America's discoverer -
but Christopher Columbus held the first Press conference!
Thereafter, the Chinese and the Scandinavians lost their rights in
history books.
	   You may have the world's best ideas, but if you do not
communicate them, they are not ideas. Chester Barnard, management
guru on managing the values of an organisation, believed there are
three basic principles for effective communication: ``Everyone
should know what the channels of communication are; everyone should
have access to a formal channel of communication; lines of
communication should be as short and direct as possible.''
	   John Welch, CEO of General Electric, is more adamant. He says:
``To create change, direct, personal, two-way communication is what
makes the difference. You've got to be out in front of the crowds,
repeating yourself over and over again, never changing your message
no matter how it bores you.''
	   Make Known Your Expectations It is a cruel world, but that's
business! As the saying goes: ``The world expects results. Don't
tell others about the labour pains - show them the BABY!''
	   Big Thoughts Strategy Thinking big is a thought leadership
strategy. Nobody succeeds by thinking small. (please see diagram)
Use Stories And Symbols Tom Peters, management consultant and
business writer, says: ``The best leaders, almost without exception
and at every level, are master users of stories and symbols.''
	   You Have To Be Hard To Be Soft You must demonstrate the ability
to make the hard, tough decisions - closing plants, divesting,
delayering - if you want to have any credibility when you try to
promote soft values. Welch practices this maxim.
	   Be Prepared Life is not a dress rehearsal - every day is opening
night.
	   Don't Just Aim - Fire! No amount of consulting and analysis can
prove your decision right.
	   Action is the key. Arthur Goldberg, a businessperson, believes
the phrase, ``If Columbus had had an advisory committee, he would
probably still be at the dock'', is true.
	   Focus On Right Issues, Not Trivial Ones If you are being
criticised, especially by business rivals, ``Don't wrestle with
pigs; you get dirty - and they enjoy it!''
	   Thought Strategy For Managing Your Business Manage by objective:
tell people exactly what you want and then get out of the way;
manage by responsibility: manage by exception: require reporting
only when there is a deviation from the plan.
	   No matter how you manage your business, you need strategy. Mitch
Sala, ex-engineer and multi-millionaire, with big business in
Australia, Indonesia and Turkey, gives this advice: ``We never,
never, ever did NOT have a strategy. You have to have a strategy.
Lock yourself away, focus, think what you are going to do; set
goals.''
	   Thought Strategy For Going Global ``How one can compete in the
global marketplace? It's difficult and takes a long time ... to win
the global competition in which form? Is it speed, innovation or
cost? It's a combination of many things. You cannot say: ``I'll
achieve this in three years.'' In the meantime, you must find a
survival mode. Survival via regional business, survival by joint
ventures, survival in one form or another.'' Stan Shih, chairman
and CEO of Acer Inc, seventh largest PC maker in the world, gave
this thought strategy on globalisation.
	   Thought Strategy For Raising Capital: Partnership With Your
Staff ``We had to face reality; using very limited resources, and
under very unfavorable conditions; the strategy is really to share
the risk. So at Acer, the capital is from employees. We share the
risk and build the vision and common goal ... then, if we make it,
everyone makes good returns.'' Shih holds this unique thought
strategy about raising capital, a means to which few companies
resort.
	   There Is More To Life Than Work Relax in odd moments; our life
is what our thoughts make it, so enjoy your work. Remember not to
get lost in your job - it's part of a larger canvas. Logan Pearsall
Smith, essayist, advocates: ``There are two things to aim for in
life: first, get what you want; after that, enjoy it. Only the
wisest achieve the second.''
	   In similar vein, Norman Vincent Peale believes: ``If you want to
be free of nervous tension and live a healthier life, widen your
interests and broaden yourself. There is a rich world around you,
in books, paintings, music, sports, and most important, people.''

Thai stock market down again, but baht gets respite
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BK101

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai stock prices, already at their
lowest level in more than a decade, fell for the fifth straight day
Thursday.
	   Dealers said the 8.18 point plunge in the Stock Exchange of
Thailand index was caused in part by foreign investors dumping
big-capitalization stocks.
	   At 283.92 points, the index hit its lowest level since Dec. 28,
1987 and was down 23.8 percent from its closing level on the last
day of trading in 1997.
	   Dealers said foreigners were selling shares in response to a
growing consensus that Thailand's economic recovery is going to be
slower and more painful than initially thought.
	   On Thursday, for example, the U.S. credit-rating agency Moody's
Investors Service warned that Thailand's economic recovery could be
hindered by the failure of Thai banks to recapitalize.
	   It said only a few banks had managed to raise large amounts of
money, and even those banks _ Bangkok Bank and Thai Farmers Bank _
remain insufficiently capitalized.
	   Some dealers attributed the slump to short-selling by foreign
investors making a bet that the index will decline to about 250
points.
	   ``People were just selling everything just to make the index go
down,'' said Songyos Kulvichien, a dealer with Securities One.
	   The Thai baht meanwhile closed a touch higher in spot trading
Thursday on weak local demand for dollars. Profit-taking by local
exporters also helped keep the dollar down, dealers said.
	   At the close of spot trading, the baht was worth 43.12 to the
dollar, slightly up from the 43.15 level it held at the close of
trading Wednesday.
	   Dealers said the baht climbed against the dollar late Thursday
afternoon on the back of gains among other regional currencies.
	   Dealers attributed a morning decline of the Thai currency partly
to the dollar's rise to a seven-year high of 141.85 yen Thursday,
which triggered a sell-off in regional currencies.

Court orders retrial for convicted Islamic sect members
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ An appeals court Thursday ordered a new
trial for 123 members of a radical Islamic sect convicted of
attempting to overturn Turkey's secular system.
	   The court said a new trial was warranted because a judge who had
earlier withdrawn from the case had later taken part in
deliberations for the verdict.
	   The defendants, all members of the Aczmendi sect, were arrested
in 1996 after they held a demonstration outside Ankara's biggest
mosque, where they shouted insults against secular Turkey's
founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, and chanted in support of an
Islamic state.
	   They were sentenced to up to four years in prison in April 1997.
	   Members of the sect wear religious dress and turbans in
violation of a 1925 ban on Islamic attire.
	   Parliament is expected to approve a government proposed package
to curb Islamic influence, including tougher punishments for
wearing Islamic garb.
	   The measures are being pushed by the powerful military, which is
intent on protecting Turkey's secular traditions.

10am to 7.45pm.
	   She said the time-table was carefully structured to make it

	   SINCE it was set up in January 1985, Kolej Damansara Utama's
School of Engineering has seen more than 2,000 of its students
graduate.
	   ``Our 13-year proven track record attests to the quality of our
programmes,'' said its dean Choong Khong Min.
	   The school specialises in Electronics, Computer, Electrical and
Telecommunications studies.
	   Its programmes include the KDU graduate diploma/University of
Lincolnshire and Humberside Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) in
Electronic and Electrical Engineering.
	   ``This unique programme, which was started in 1990, is a
home-grown course developed by KDU,'' said Choong.
	   Among its special features is that graduates get three
qualifications in one programme.
	   ``Besides the KDU graduate diploma and ULH degree, students also
acquire professional qualifications from the Engineering Council,
Britain,'' added Choong.
	   All three years of the course are done at KDU, which works out
to substantial savings of up to RM150,000.
	   The course also includes a component in industrial training -
something that is rare among local private colleges, said Choong.
	   ``Industrial training is important as it provides exposure for
students in a real working environment,'' he added.
	   Entry requirements to the KDU diploma include SPM, GCE O-level
or equivalent qualifications.
	   For the ULH degree, entry requirements into Year One are the KDU
Foundation in Science and Engineering, STPM, GCE A-evel or other
equivalent qualifications.
	   With KDU's Diploma in Engineering or other recognised equivalent
qualifications, students gain entry directly into Year Two of the
ULH programme.
	   Three are three intakes yearly, with the next one commencing on
Aug 24.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Flight attendants and ground crew of
troubled Philippine Airlines threatened Thursday to join a strike
by about 600 pilots if the company institutes layoffs in a move to
cut costs.
	   ``We are going all the way with the pilots,'' said Roberto
Anduiza, president of the 2,100-strong Flight Attendants and
Stewardesses Association of the Philippines.
	   Members of the union, along with the airline's ground personnel,
joined the striking pilots in a picket of PAL offices at Manila's
airport.
	   Gerry Rivera, vice president of the PAL Employees Association,
which represents ground crew and sales personnel, said they will
declare their own strike if the company attempts to reduce the work
force or slash salaries.
	   On Wednesday, the financially beleaguered airline announced it
will no longer accept back the striking pilots and will sharply
reduce its operations to match the few pilots it still has.
	   It earlier announced plans to cut staff, slash costs and reduce
flights to survive its long-term financial problems.
	   The pilots went on strike last Friday to protest a new
management policy of ordering pilots to retire who have reached 20
years of service or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age. The
policy puts 225 pilots in danger of forced retirement, said Capt.
Sotico Lloren, president of the pilots' union.
	   PAL, however, said it was not a unilateral management policy but
a provision in a collective bargaining agreement signed by airline
and union officials.
	   President Fidel Ramos said the government, which owns a minority
stake in PAL, was concerned with the damage to the airline caused
by the dispute, which he described as ``big, bloody and costly.''
	   Ramos ordered labor officials to find ways to achieve a
settlement. However, a meeting between department officials,
airline and union representatives ended Thursday afternoon without
success.
	   Labor Secretary Cresenciano Trajano said both sides remained
inflexible. He said he would decide soon whether the airline can
retire pilots under the collective bargaining agreement.
	   Another labor official said a lawyer representing PAL walked out
during a break in the meeting, causing the talks to abruptly end.
	   In a statement Thursday, the airline said it would resume
regular but limited flights to 14 domestic cities and Tokyo,
Singapore, Hong Kong and San Francisco beginning Friday, the
centennial of Philippine independence from over 300 years of
Spanish colonialism.
	   Before the 620-strong Airline Pilots Association of the
Philippines went on strike, the airline flew 160 daily domestic
flights to 39 points and served 30 overseas cities in 17 countries.
	   PAL said the strike has cost it about 150 million pesos (dlrs
3.8 million) a day in lost revenue. It lost 8 billion pesos (dlrs
205 million) last fiscal year _ three times more than the previous
year.

one-year diploma programme.
	   Upon completion of the diploma, students can pursue their ABE
Advanced Diploma.
	   From there, the diploma holders can gain entry into the third
year of degree programmes in Business Studies or Business
Administration in selected universities in the UK, Australia and
New Zealand. It also serves as an entry qualification for MBA
programmes.
	   The college is also conducting courses for the Chartered
Institute of Marketing.
	   Brickfields College is also offering the MBA in collaboration
with Sheffield Hallam University (SHU), UK.
	   Ram said the college was scheduled to start a number of distance
learning programmes which will be offered via the Internet late
this year or early next year.

Lull in fighting as world weighs military and political action

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbs and ethnic Albanians took a
break in fighting Thursday as NATO weighed military options to stop
the violence in the separatist province of Kosovo.
	   Meanwhile, a British diplomat urged both sides to compromise and
strongly suggested Kosovo should regain autonomy that was stripped
from it in 1989.
	   No fighting was reported by either side Thursday, although
skirmishes between heavily armed Serbian police and soldiers and
the ethnic Albanian militants of the Kosovo Liberation Army have
become a daily occurrence.
	   More than 250 people have been killed since police began a
crackdown in March on militants in the province, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-1 and have been ruled repressively
since Serbia stripped Kosovo of broad autonomy in 1989.
	   NATO allies, increasingly worried that a lack of action will
send violence spiraling out of control in the southern Balkans, met
Thursday in Brussels and weighed an immediate show of firepower to
deter Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic from further military
action in Kosovo.
	   Tony Lloyd, No. 2 in Britain's Foreign Office, met Albanian
leaders in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, and afterwards urged both
secessionists and Serbian authorities to compromise.
	   ``There has to be a negotiating process...to stop the bloodshed.
We made it clear that we endorse negotiations for autonomy for the
people, the Albanians in Kosovo,'' Lloyd said.
	   He had met previously with top officials of the Serb-dominated
Yugoslav federation in Belgrade.
	   Lloyd blamed the government for most of the violence, but said
``our condemnation is equally about violence by the KLA in
Kosovo.''
	   Serbia vows never to allow the secession of Kosovo, historically
the cultural heartland of the state.
	   Talks between the sides began last month under Western pressure,
but have made no progress and were suspended last week as the
Albanians protested a Serbian government offensive in western
Kosovo.

Patten starts work into reforming Northern Ireland's police
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Chris Patten, Britain's last
governor of Hong Kong, launched himself Thursday into one of the
most disputed parts of the Belfast peace agreement _ how to make
Northern Ireland's predominantly Protestant police force more
acceptable to Catholics.
	   Patten, appointed earlier this month as chairman of the
Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland, arrived in
Belfast to meet senior officials of the Police Authority.
	   The government-appointed Authority, which is supposed to oversee
the 13,000-strong Royal Ulster Constabulary, has been widely
criticized as lacking the will to pursue substantial reform.
	   Patten, an English Catholic, was accompanied by his six
colleagues, among them two law-enforcement experts from the United
States: Gerald Lynch, president of John Jay College in New York,
and Kathleen O'Toole, secretary for public safety in Massachusetts.
	   The proposal for police reform formed a particularly emotive
part of the Belfast agreement struck April 10 among eight parties.
	   While many pro-British Protestants want the force retained as
is, militant Catholic supporters of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party
demand that it be abolished.
	   Sinn Fein sympathizers in Irish-American circles have criticized
the selection of O'Toole on the grounds that she has has previously
advised Northern Ireland's police commander, Chief Constable Ronnie
Flanagan.
	   The agreement, ratified May 22 by voters in both parts of
Ireland, empowers Patten's commission to make proposals ``designed
to ensure that ... Northern Ireland has a police service that can
enjoy widespread support from, and is seen as an integral part of,
the community as a whole.''
	   Also Thursday, Sinn Fein accused the IRA's old ``Official'' wing
of trying to shoot one of its election workers.
	   Three or four bullets were fired at party activist Paddy McAvoy
as he walked through the Catholic Markets neighborhood of
south-central Belfast, but he wasn't hit.
	   The area's senior Sinn Fein figure, Sean Hayes, accused ``a
well-known armed organization in the area who pretend not to
exist'' of targeting McAvoy.
	   The IRA split in December 1969 into ``Official'' and
``Provisional'' wings. The Official IRA stopped its campaign
against British rule of Northern Ireland in 1972, but its several
dozen members continue to pursue personal and criminal vendettas
with the now-dominant Provisional IRA, which called its own truce
in July 1997.

World Cup: Team eager to show off Japanese soccer

<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ With Japan's arrival at the World
Cup, everyone is about to get a good look at Japanese soccer. For
the players, displaying their game at this grand international
stage is almost as important as winning.
	   ``I want to test how much Japanese soccer today can hold up
against the best teams in the world. And I want to pass what I
learn to others in Japan,'' said midfielder Hiroshi Nanami.
	   And what is Japanese soccer?
	   Quickness, tight teamwork, intelligent passing, some say. On the
other hand, physical strength, fantastic dribbling, decisive
shooting don't come to mind.
	   Japanese soccer, with a professional league only in its sixth
season, has been influenced both by the German and Brazilian
styles.
	   ``Soccer in Brazil has been around for a century,'' said
Brazil-born forward Wagner Lopes, who joined the team last year
after becoming a Japanese citizen. ``Gradually, Japanese soccer has
to learn and gain experience to become great. It has to become more
fun to watch.''
	   Hiroshi Hayano, a soccer commentator for NHK-TV, believes Nanami
is the critical link for Japan.
	   How well the 25-year-old No. 10 can suavely move up the ball to
the offense will be key in Sunday's opener against Argentina,
Hayano said in a recent interview at this resort training camp.
	   ``Even if they don't win, I want them to show what kind of
soccer Japanese are capable of,'' said Chieko Aburanokoji, 39, a
die-hard Nanami fan, who quit her job to follow the team around in
France.
	   ``I love his pretty, beautiful passes. And I love watching how
beautiful he looks when he makes those passes,'' she said.
	   ``People are probably coming to see what Japanese soccer is
about,'' said 29-year-old midfielder Motohiro Yamaguchi. ``Rather
than trying to explain it in words, I think people will understand,
when they see it.''

Viagra pills disappear at Israeli parliament inquiry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ It's hard to keep a good pill around.
	   Samples of the Viagra impotence drug disappeared at a meeting of
an Israeli parliamentary science committee on Wednesday,
embarrassing doctors and other experts who had been called to
testify about the drug's safety.
	   The theft was discovered when committee chairwoman Dalia Itzik
asked if she could keep the box the pills came in, a committee
official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
	   Dr. Ami Sidi, an Israeli expert on impotence, opened the package
to empty it before handing it over, and found that only four of the
eight pills he had brought were left.
	   Shortly afterwards, the empty box also disappeared.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
said Thursday it appeared Israel's parliament did not plan to
investigate the Maccabiah bridge collapse which claimed the lives
of four Australian athletes last year.
	   Downer made the comment to reporters after meeting with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was non-committal about an
independent probe by parliament that has been proposed by the
families of victims.

	   MEMBERS and non-members of the Young Women's Christian
Association experienced a New Zealand culinary demonstration held
at its centre in Jalan Hang Jebat, Kuala Lumpur last Saturday.
	   Organised by the Youth Group of the YWCA, the demonstration was
by New Zealand Hotel and Cafeteria chef Justin Chambers, who showed
how to prepare avocado, lamb cutlets, caramelised oranges, salad,
potato gratin- de-Dauphinous and meringue.
	   Chambers showed the audience how to discard the fat off lamb
strip loins before preparing the meat for lamb cutlets.
	   ``Most people dislike fat for health reasons. The fat on the
meat should be scraped off and cooked with very little oil to
season the meat.
	   ``The seasoned lamb, brown on both sides, should be dry, dipped
into beaten eggs and rolled into a mixture of herbs, crumbs, spice
and ground pepper before being cooked in the oven,'' said Chambers,
who gave a step- by-step demonstration.
	   Members present gave a helping hand to the chef in cleaning and
peeling potatoes, beating up mixtures and putting some finishing
touches to final decorations.
	   Youth Club co-ordinator Jeya Sothy Thangaratnam said Chambers,
whose mother is a member of the YWCA, volunteered to give the
demonstration to enlighten members on New Zealand cuisine.
	   ``The purpose of the Youth Group in organising this
demonstration is to provide an opportunity for young people to work
together on concerns that affect the welfare of the community and
participate more effectively in community affairs.
	   ``It also provides an opportunity to meet, work with and know
individuals and groups of varying backgrounds and experiences,
discover new interests and skills, learn leadership skills, have
fellowship with one another and share and experience each other's
cultures,'' Thangaratnam said.
	   She added that a series of programmes have been organised for
young adults for the months of June, July and August.
	   There will be a ``Basic Writing Skills Workshop'' on June 20 and
21, talks on ``Breast Cancer'' with breast scans (date yet to be
confirmed), ``What you should know about Sexual Harassment'' on
July 11 and ``Hands On Skin and Beauty Care'', ``Practical Pointers
in Self-Defence'' and ``Pizza and Pop Party'' with social dancing
on Aug 1.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Hundreds of foreigners prepared to flee
the West African country of Guinea-Bissau on Thursday as government
forces prepared to crush a rebellion led by renegade soldiers,
officials said.
	   The estimated 700 evacuees, including Portuguese, French and
Americans, were to be taken from the capital Bissau by a Portuguese
merchant ship, a spokesman for the Portuguese defense ministry said
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bissau said there was
``significant fighting going on'' while the evacuation took place.
	   ``The rebels are shelling downtown districts and the
government's troops are shelling them,'' Bryan Hunt said in a
telephone interview with the Lisbon bureau of the Associated Press.

	   FOLLOWING the success of animated cartoon series Usop Sontorian,
aired on Saturdays and Sundays on RTM1, its creator Ujang aka
Ibrahim Mohd Noor has a new surprise for lovers of the cartoon.
	   The cartoon series which made its debut in March 1996 has also
become a hit in countries like Switzerland, the United States of
America and Singapore.
	   Ujang, under his own company Multi Triple Vision Sdn Bhd, is in
the final stages of producing his first animated love story series
entitled Kartini.
	   The characters created by Azhar Ahmad, who is better known as
Tembakau, have been very well received by schoolchildren.
	   The story was based on his own experiences during his school
days, from the perspective of a cartoonist, of course.
	   The launching of Kartini's collection and preview of the cartoon
series was officiated by Deputy Entrepreneur Development Minister
Datuk Idris Jusoh at The Mall in Kuala Lumpur last Saturday.
	   MTV managing director Ujang said the home video series was done
in collaboration with Reka Pintar Sdn Bhd, the company that
produced Usop Sontorian.
	   He said the first batch of 40,000 to 50,000 copies of the video
will be sold from September. Kartini has about 160,000 fans in the
country.
	   ``We will market the video series ourselves. It will be made
available through our agents who sell the Lanun magazine and Ujang
products,'' Ujang said.
	   He said the 12-episode series, each 45 minutes long, will be
sold at RM20 each.
	   Ujang said Kartini fans would be delighted to see the characters
- Kartini, Yon, Alim and Akai - come to live.
	   He disclosed that the video was now 60 per cent completed.
	   ``We started the project in February. It involves only 25
animators. We have to cut costs in view of the country's economic
problems.
	   ``When we produced Usop Santorian in 1993, we used 100
animators.''
	   Ujang said the company also plans to produce Kartini for
television but the episodes would be different from those that they
have produced on video.
	   He said MTV would try to set a world record in August by drawing
the longest cartoon banner.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The European Investment Bank has agreed to
lend Jordan 83 million European Currency Units (dlrs 89 million) to
increase potash production by 17 percent and to renovate the water
network in Amman.
	   The state-run Petra News Agency said Thursday that dlrs 43
million of the total will be spent to construct pipelines, pumping
stations and storage facilities in Amman.
	   Officials say that 55 percent of the water pumped in Jordan is
lost in a rusted network built in the 1940s.
	   Petra said the loan will be repayable over 10 years starting in
2003 and with a 1.2 percent annual interest rate.
	   It said the rest, or dlrs 46 million, will be used to expand
potash plants to hike production 17 percent to 2.11 million tons a
year.
	   Petra did not disclose the terms of the potash loan, but said
that Jordan obtained loan guarantees from the European bank.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
closed at 2,153.7 at the end of the trading week, 31.1 points, or
1.42 percent lower than the previous week, The National Investments
Co. said Thursday.
	   In a weekly report, the company said trading was affected by
tensions between Parliament and the government that could lead to
the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, disbanding the legislature
this weekend. The prime minister, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah,
has reportedly informed the emir that the Cabinet could no longer
work with the 50-seat house.
	   Some 205.93 million shares changed hands this week, down 17.19
percent from last week's 248.67 million. The value of these shares
also fell 20.81 percent from last week registering 57.64 million
dinars (dlrs 188.37 million). It was 72.79 million dinars (dlrs
237.87 million) last week.
	   Of the 75 companies listed on the exchange, 18 closed higher, 19
closed lower, and 23 were unchanged. The rest were not traded.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Kuwait-based United Arab Shipping Co. signed a
dlrs 250 million loan agreement Thursday that will partly finance
the building of ten new container ships.
	   A UASC statement said the agreement was concluded with a number
of banks including the Gulf International Bank, the Arab Banking
Corp. - both based in Bahrain - and the National Bank of Kuwait.
The GIB will underwrite the loan.
	   The loan will partly finance a dlrs 660 million contract with a
Japanese consortium to build ten new container vessels, the
statement said. The rest of the funds will be supplied by the UASC.
	   The new vessels will raise the company's fleet to 56 ships, the
company said. It did not provide dates for their expected delivery.
	   UASC is owned by the governments of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Iraq.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices and turnover slipped on the
stock exchange this week amid a liquidity crunch and political
uncertainty over prospects for a Palestinian-Israeli settlement,
brokers said Thursday.
	   A stock market report, reflecting activity for four business
days ending Wednesday, said the 60-company general share prices
index declined by 1.45 percent to 172.36 points.
	   It said turnover slipped by 23.8 percent to 4.8 million dinars
(dlrs 6.5 million).
	   Shares of commercial banks dropped by 2.12 percent, industrial
firms by 0.34 percent and the services sector by 0.22 percent. But
shares of insurance firms increased 1.66 percent.
	   Stocks of 90 companies were traded during the week, the report
added.
 &UR; ___
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is negotiating with some 21 foreign
companies to explore its western desert for crude oil deposits, a
Baghdad weekly reported Thursday.
	   Al-Zawra said talks with the firms are at an advanced stage. It
did not name the companies or give their nationalities.
	   Iraq has the world's second largest proven oil reserves after
Saudi Arabia. U.N. trade sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait, bar Iraqi oil exports except for limited sales
as part of an oil-for-food program.

	   PAY a visit to City Villa Hotel Kuala Lumpur (formerly Asia
Hotel) anytime until Aug 3 and let the hotel staff pamper you.
	   The hotel launched its ``Let Us Manja U'' campaign for the third
year running recently, with the opening of Antara Holiday Villa's
first hotel at Cherating in Pahang.
	   The launching was officiated by Antara chairman Azman Shah Haron
in the presence of City Villa managing director Ahmad Kamal
Merican.
	   Hotel resident manager Suraya Ariffin said the campaign was a
sort of quality service assurance practised by all Antara hotel
subsidiaries.
	   She said it was an annual event but the campaign period differed
from one hotel to another.
	   She said the acronym Manja stands for Must smile and be
courteous, Anticipate our customers needs, Never forget that
customers are No 1, Just ensure that there is a detailed follow-up
and always give our personal attention.
	   During the period, staff will have to follow a manual that has
been prepared by the management.
	   ``Within these two months our customers are given the chance to
nominate their favourite staff from the `front of the house', which
includes front office and coffeehouse, and the `back of the house'
comprising housekeeping, security and administration departments.
	   Suraya said winning staff will be treated to a seven-day cross
exposure training stint at any of the Antara Holiday Villa chain
hotels in the country with all expenses paid.
	   In addition, they will also receive a plaque, souvenir and
certificate each.
	   In conjunction with the launching of the Manja campaign, City
Villa presented awards to its best employees from various
department. They were Rostam Jamaludin, Normala Hassan, Yong Oi
Mian, Sabari Abdul Hamid, Hasniro Hasbullah, Ravi Nagappan and Samy
Sinnan.
	   Twenty-eight employees whose birthdays fell between April and
June were also feted.

Iraq bans tourists from Kurdish north
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The government has banned local and foreign
tourists from traveling to northern Iraq, saying American and
Israeli agents are roaming freely in the area, a Baghdad weekly
reported Thursday.
	   Al-Zawra said the government's Tourism Department issued orders
to travel agencies asking them not to organize trips to the
districts of Irbil, Dahouk and Sulaimaniya, which are under
government control.
	   All other districts in northern Iraq are under the control of
Kurdish rebels who are helped by the United States and Britain. The
two nations' air forces enforce a no-fly zone over the area to keep
the Iraqi military away.
	   ``The extraordinary situation in our beloved north and the
presence of American and Zionist (Israeli) agents there makes the
region unstable from the security point of view,'' the weekly said,
quoting Tourism Department head Abdulkarim Maki.
	   It did not elaborate and Maki was not immediately available for
comment.
	   The ban on travel applies only to tourists. People who have
relatives or legitimate business in the area can still go. Most of
the tourists to northern Iraq are people from central and southern
Iraq.

	   KOTA BARU, Tues. - The State Immigration Department has rounded
up 28 Thais, including eight women, for working in the State
illegally.
	   The department also detained five locals for allegedly
harbouring the foreigners.
	   Its enforcement chief Zakaria Husin said the foreigners were
between the ages of 17 and 34.
	   ``The Thais were working at food stalls in Jalan Kubang Kerian,
Panji and Parit Dalam while the locals are the owners.''
	   He said 15 officers led by the department director Kamaluddin
Amah raided the places after receiving a tip-off.

	   The long march to the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) ended at
Khagrachhari yesterday with BNP chief Begum Khaleda Zia calling a
country-wide dawn-to-dusk hartal on June 18, and a programme of
demonstrations across the country on June 22.
	   The programmes were announced at a grand rally at the
Khagrachhari stadium. The rally also addressed by leaders of the
five component parties of the 7-party alliance marked the close of
the 400-kilometre long march that had started from Dhaka on Tuesday
morning.
	   The long march was organised to press the demand to scrap the
agreement on the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) that Begum Zia
alleged had not only violated the Constitution but also snatched
the fundamental rights of the people.
	   Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh that took its long march to
Bandarban, announced demonstrations on June 22, and a gherao of the
Prime Minister's office in Dhaka during the first week of July.
	   The BNP caravan that went to Khagrachhari comprised nearly 2000
motor vehicles and carried about one lakh long marchers, Amir
Khashru Mahmud Chowdhury told newsmen in Chittagong.
	   Police sources in Chittagong, however, said that the caravan had
little over one thousand vehicles and carried about 50,000 people.
	   During the return trip from Khagrachhari more than a dozen long
marchers were injured when a bus met an accident as its front
wheels got loose at Shapmara. The injured passengers joined the
caravan after receiving treatment. The accident caused dislocation
during the return trip.
	   The Dhaka-bound section of the long march caravan crossed
Comilla at 11-30 P.M. last night, according to reports reaching
Dhaka
	   Abdur Rahman Khan from Khagrachhari writes: Begum Khaleda Zia
announced her new programme of movement to protest the obstruction
created on the way of the long march, price hike, economic crisis,
deterioration of law and order, and the failure to meet the demands
for gas, power and water.
	   Addressing a huge rally at the Khagrachhari stadium at the final
stage of the two-day long march, Begum Khaleda who looked extremely
tired spoke at the meeting for 30 minutes sharply criticised the
government for signing the agreement on the Chittagong Hill Tracts
and enacting the four laws to enforce it.
	   She said that the CHT agreement had violated the Constitution on
the one hand and snatched the fundamental rights of the people on
the other. The laws that had been enacted would benefit the ruling
party, but neither the tribals nor the Bangla-speaking people. The
CHT agreement would not bring peace, but rather widen the divisive
trend, she said.
	   The district administration and police allowed only the cars and
jeeps into the town and stopped buses and mini-buses at the bus
stand. Most long marchers, exhausted as they were, failed to make
it to the venue of the meeting.
	   Presided over by Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, President of the
Khagrachhari district unit of the BNP the meeting was also
addressed by BNP leaders Prof. Badruddoza Chowdhury, Secretary
General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, Barrister Abdus Salam Talukdar, Col
(retd) Oli Ahmed, Assistant Secretary General of Jamaat Mohammad
Qamruzzaman, Jatiya Party (Z-M) Co-convener Kazi Zafar Ahmed,
Shawkat Hossain Nilo of the Progressive Nationalist Party, Shafiul
Alam Prodhan of JAGPA, Saifuddin Moni of the Democratic League.
Former MP Mama Ching conducted the meeting.
	   The long march caravan entered Khagrachhari at 2-45 P.M.
peacefully. The Superintendent of Police of Khagrachhari Lutfur
Rahman told The Independent that police and BDR personnel had been
deployed at the Khagrachhari road. No vehicle except those of the
long march were allowed to enter Khagrachhari.
	   A number of arches was erected to welcome the long march on way
from Chittagong to Khagrachhari. The long marchers removed white
flags that had been hoisted the day before by workers of the Awami
League. Bangla-speaking people from different areas of Khagrachhari
arrived in the town in trucks by noon.
	   Begum Zia said that the CHT agreement was in no way acceptable
as it had snatched the land rights and the right to vote of the
people. ``We want an agreement that would ensure equal rights to
all and a law that would establish permanent peace. All of us want
to live as Bangladeshis and coexist here peacefully,'' she said.
	   She said that the present government during its two years in
power had signed two ``anti-people treaties.'' The people of
Bangladesh could not accept those ``black and unequal treaties.''
	   Begun Zia said that the long march was part of the movement.
Thanking the people for making it a success she urged the people to
remain prepared for tougher programmes in future to force the
``autocratic government to quit.''
	   She said that her party had not called hartal on June 23, the
date fixed by the government to open the Jamuna multipurpose
bridge, even though the AL had not hesitated to call hartal on the
day the foundation stone of the bridge had been laid by her
government in 1994. The BNP chief said it was her government that
had started the construction of the bridge after collecting the
fund for it.
	   Earlier our Staff Correspondent from Chittagong reported: The
long marchers led by opposition leader Begum Zia in a convoy of
about 2,000 vehicles left for Khagrachhari at 9.30 am yesterday.
	   Earlier Begum Zia was greeted by more than 2,000 BNP supporters
as she arrived at Chittagong Circuit House at the head of a convoy
of more than 1800 vehicles at about 6 am after a tiresome 21-hour
journey from Dhaka that included a 9-hour barricade at Kanchpur off
the capital.
	   Begum Zia, clad in white saree, looked lively while resuming the
long march to demand the scrapping of the CHT accord and four acts.
	   On her way to Chittagong Begum Zia addressed 27 wayside rallies
at different places including Daudkandi, Comilla by-pass,
Choudhagram, Feni, Mohipal, Barahatta and Sitakund.
	   At Mohipal seven crackers exploded at the site of the rally at
about 2.15 am. A bomb also exploded in front of Begum Zia's car and
another behind the car carrying journalists. None, however, was
injured.
	   ``People have welcomed the long march while the government, in a
bid to prevent the march, proved that it was involved in a
conspiracy'' the former prime minister told the rallies adding ``it
proves that the government wants to hand over the CHT to
foreigners''.
	   The BNP Chairperson harshly criticised the police for not taking
action against the ``terrorists seen roaming with arms at
Kanchpur''.
	   She reiterated her allegation that the government was out to
sell out one-tenth of the country's territory and vowed to resist
the attempt at any cost.
	   Jamaat-e-Islami Ameer, Prof. Golam Azam arrived in Chittagong at
7.30 am and held a rally at Laldighi ground. They left for
Rangamati at about 11.30 am. The party claimed that about 400
vehicles made up its convoy in the long march.
	   Jatiya party (Z-M) led by Kazi Zafar Ahmed, and other parties
reached Chittagong at 8.30 am. They also held a rally at Kazir
Dewri at 10 AM.
	   Our Correspondent from Cox's Bazar reported: No transports plied
on the Cox's Bazar-Chittagong highway during the last two days due
to the opposition sponsored long march. Cox's Bazar district thus
remained cut off from other parts of the country by road. The
transport owners refrained from plying the vehicles on the road,
fearing trouble. No national newspapers reached the district during
the two days.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Opposition groups and Nigeria's new regime
appeared headed toward a confrontation as government officials
demanded Thursday that pro-democracy protests be canceled.
	   The protests and a call for a nationwide strike planned for
Friday _ initially intended to mark the annulment of June 12, 1993
presidential elections _ have taken on added significance coming
just three days after Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar's rise to power as
the country's latest military ruler.
	   Abubakar has angered Nigeria's opposition by offering only a
vague pledge to continue a transition to civilian rule that began
under Gen. Sani Abacha, the dictator who died Monday.
	   Two days after assuming power, and a day after promising a
return to civilian rule, Abubakar appeared to be consolidating his
power base in Africa's most populous nation.
	   Two members of his inner circle were under house arrest in the
capital, Abuja, two independent sources confirmed Wednesday on
condition of anonymity.
	   Opponents said they planned to challenge Abubakar's leadership
in court.
	   Gani Fawehinmi, a Lagos attorney and one of the country's
best-known opposition activists, said he would file suit in the
Nigerian high court challenging Abubakar's appointment to replace
Abacha.

Milosevic will meet Yeltsin in Moscow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS days of visit to Monday and Tuesday in graf 2,
UPDATES with Foreign Ministry spokesman's comments. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic will meet
with President Boris Yeltsin during a two-day visit to Moscow next
week, the Russian presidential press service said Thursday.
	   Yeltsin invited Milosevic to Russia to discuss the situation in
the Balkan region, including the crisis in Kosovo, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said. Milosevic will be in Moscow on Monday and
Tuesday.
	   Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov discussed the
crisis over the telephone on the eve of Primakov's talks Friday
with his counterparts in the Group of Eight.
	   Russia firmly opposes options for military intervention being
considered by NATO. However, Moscow favors strengthened control
over Kosovo's borders with Albania and Macedonia.
	   ``It is ... necessary to ensure reliable monitoring of the
borders with Kosovo ... to prevent the infiltration of weapons and
terrorist groups into Kosovo,'' said Vladimir Rakhmanin, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman.
	   Primakov is expected to present these views during a meeting in
London with foreign ministers of the G-8 countries. No details of
his conversation with Yeltsin were disclosed.
	   NATO is considering military intervention to stop Serb attacks
on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The alliance has also considered
options for indirectly pressuring Milosevic, who is blamed for the
attacks.
	   Yeltsin has said that he would try to use his influence on
Milosevic, but that he remains firmly against NATO intervention.
Russia is also unlikely to support a ban on investment in Serbia
and a freeze of its foreign assets, Primakov has said.
	   ``We believe that the main efforts of the international
community should be focused today on the resumption of negotiations
between Belgrade and Pristina (the capital of Kosovo),'' Rakhmanin
said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   More than 250 people have died in Kosovo during clashes between
government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of
the Albanian independence movement.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of the southern
province's population, are demanding independence from Serbia, the
dominant republic of the two left in the Yugoslav federation.

Tehran mayor challenges the judge to produce evidence of graft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The mayor of Tehran challenged a judge
Thursday to produce evidence of his alleged corruption, telling a
packed courtroom he had not pocketed a penny of public money.
	   Gholamhossein Karbaschi, who pleaded innocent on the first day
of his trial Sunday, was accused by the judge Thursday of
embezzling money from the municipality to buy a building for a
now-defunct newspaper of which he was the managing editor.
	   ``If I am a thief, say it. If I have received bribes, say from
whom I received them. In the last session the charges were
cooperation in embezzlement, but now I'm accused of embezzling
money. Sir, if I am a thief, please tell me where I stole from, ''
Karbaschi said.
	   The judge, Hojatoleslam Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei, tried to
silence Karbaschi, but the popular mayor refused to stop.
	   ``If you don't want me to talk, give the order to send me to
prison where I was before,'' Karbaschi said.
	   The judge relented and Karbaschi continued, speaking for a total
of two hours before a gallery of 130 people and dozens of
journalists. Outside the central Tehran courthouse, several hundred
people watched the proceedings on two television screens.
	   Karbaschi said he had spent 100 billion rials (dlrs 21 million)
on the construction of buildings and flyovers in Tehran. The
expenditures had been approved by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei.
	   ``Not even one rial of the money mentioned in my charges have
gone into my pocket. If the issue of embezzlement is not clarified
to the people, this will damage the Islamic republic,'' he said,
referring to the smallest unit in the national currency, equivalent
to 0.02 U.S. cents.
	   Karbaschi's trial is widely seen as an attempt by hard-line
elements in the ruling clergy to topple key officials allied with
moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. Karbaschi ran
Khatami's election campaign last year.
	   He was arrested on April 4 on the orders of the chief justice, a
known hardliner. But his supporters took to the streets and, after
a clash between pro-Karbaschi protesters and security forces,
Khamenei ordered his release on bail.
	   It was thought Khamenei feared an escalation of the power
struggle between the conservatives and moderates in the government.
	   The court case has gripped the nation, generating hundreds of
newspaper stories for and against the popular mayor. Not all the
trial observers Thursday supported the mayor. As Karbaschi left the
courthouse, a dozen hardliners yelled ``Death to Karbaschi.''
	   If convicted, Karbaschi faces up to 10 years in jail, a fine and
a ban from holding public office.
	   The trial was adjourned to Tuesday and is expected to last
several weeks.

	   THE Malaysian Highway Authority may soon upgrade some parts of
the New Pantai Expressway if the concession holder, Maxtro
Engineering Sdn Bhd, is unable to do so in time for the
Commonwealth Games.
	   This is because work on the project has slowed down
considerably.
	   Although the project is only scheduled to be fully completed
next year, some stretches are part of the network of highways and
expressway to venues for the games.
	   Motorists, for example, can use the Kesas
Highway-Damansara-Puchong Highway (LDP)-New Pantai Expressway from
Bukit Jalil to Kuala Lumpur.
	   Those wanting to go from Shah Alam to Subang could use the Kesas
Highway to access Subang Jaya via the Jalan Kewajipan interchange
and enter the New Pantai Expressway to venues in Bandar Sunway and
Kelana Jaya via the LDP.
	   LLM director-general Datuk Chua Soon Poh said the protocol route
to the games venue would be affected if nothing was done to
complete crucial stretches.
	   ``If Maxtro is unable to complete the stretches and carry out
the necessary upgrading work, we will have to do it ourselves,'' he
said.
	   He said LLM would also have to consider alternative routes.
	   Chua said although Maxtro was expected to revive the abandoned
project at Subang Jaya over the next three months, LLM was not
ruling out the possibility that the project will not be partly
ready for use during the games.
	   ``Maxtro has assured us that they would be able to settle the
problem and start on the project in three months,'' he said in a
fax to the New Straits Times.
	   Chua said the project had not been abandoned but had merely
slowed down.
	   ``The project was not delayed but for the moment Maxtro has
slowed work because of its finances.
	   ``Maxtro is still going on with work to dig a tunnel at Jalan
Pantai Baru and piling work at Taman Maju Jaya,'' he said.
	   Chua said work at the Jalan Jengka roundabout, Jalan Kewajipan
roundabout to Jalan PJS 8/1 had stopped since January.
	   Asked if Maxtro had failed to secure financial assistance to
continue with the project, he said the Government had not studied
the possibility as Maxtro was still in the process of settling its
problems.
	   ``We will give Maxtro time to try to get back on its feet,''
Chua said.
	   On April 14, Works Minister Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu had said
Maxtro might be given financial assistance soon.
	   He had said the Government was seriously considering help for
``those who are already half-way in the construction of
infrastructure projects''.
	   His Ministry had earmarked the RM1.39 billion Kajang Traffic
Dispersal Scheme and the RM600 million New Pantai Expressway.
	   The Minister had said he would propose to the Treasury that
these projects be given some financial assistance so that work on
them can proceed.
	   Samy Vellu had said loans for these two projects were withdrawn
due to the economic downturn even though they had been approved
earlier.
	   The New Pantai Expressway is a new link between Subang Jaya-Old
Klang Road and Bangsar.
	   The project was conceived as an alternative to the congested
Federal Highway and started construction in January.
	   The Subang Jaya Municipal Council has expressed fear that the
delayed project would affect the routes for the Games. It has
written to the Economic Planning Unit in the Prime Minister's
Department and the Malaysian Highway Authority on the matter.

South Africa, Vichy forge partnership at World Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ In a summer fling with political poignancy,
South Africa and the town of Vichy have forged a World Cup
partnership aimed at helping both dispel their dark pasts.
	   For the picturesque, riverside community of 27,700 residents,
hosting a World Cup team means a chance to show off its
sports-oriented tourist attractions, and counter its reputation as
the French capital of Nazi collaboration.
	   ``It's very sad for us when people talk about Vichy, Vichy,''
said George Frelastre, a member of the city council for 31 years.
``We have this complex.''
	   The complex dates to 1940, when French leaders set up a new
government in Vichy after fleeing Paris when German invaders
overran the country. The Vichy government collaborated with the
German occupation and administered two-fifths of the country. In
return, Vichy sent workers and goods to Germany to support the Nazi
war machine.
	   Ever since the liberation of France in 1944, Vichy has struggled
to overcome its stigma. Ranked before the war as France's No. 1 spa
with mineral springs, it has since slipped below the top 10.
	   Vichy now stresses its modern sports facilities, including a
man-made kayaking run on the Allier River, to attract visitors and
stage sports events.
	   Getting the South African soccer team to set up its World Cup
headquarters in Vichy is regarded as ``very important'' for the
town's tourism, Frelastre said, while watching a Zulu tribal dance
on the central square.
	   ``Vichy was an international city at the beginning of the
century and now again at the end,'' he beamed.
	   South Africa, meanwhile, is playing in its first World Cup after
being banned from international soccer for 28 years because of
apartheid. A strong performance, coupled with good relations with
its hosts, would further raise South Africa's international profile
four years after the end of white rule.
	   South African Ambassador Barbara Masekela, addressing players at
a reception Monday night, said the World Cup is one of the most
important events for South Africa since the first all-race election
four years ago brought Nelson Mandela to power.
	   ``South Africa is a young country and they want to show and
prove to the world their ambition and vision, not only on the pitch
but in the mind,'' coach Philippe Troussier said.
	   Troussier, a Frenchman, pushed for South Africa to be based in
Vichy, which is about 500 kilometers (300 miles) south of Paris
amid rolling, fertile farmland. He knew the city dearly wanted to
host a World Cup team after losing its bid to stage tournament
matches because it lacked an adequate stadium.
	   Evidence of the romance between the city and its guests abounds.
South African flags fly alongside French banners on street corners,
in front of hotels and in shop windows.
	   Hundreds of townspeople turned out Sunday night to welcome the
visitors, with a police escort leading the bus past the cheering,
waving crowd. The first practice session Monday night drew more
than 500 people who clapped and cheered a good shot or save during
a fast-paced attacking drill.
	   On Tuesday night, hundreds of townfolk and the South African
players attended a concert by South African singer Miriam Makeba in
the opulent opera house, while drummers entertained a nearby street
party in honor of the African visitors.
	   Outside the team headquarters at the luxurious Hotel Aletti
Palace, dozens of people wait each day for a wave or perhaps an
autograph. Even the trainers and equipment handlers get approached.
	   After getting an autograph, most fans have to read it to see who
the player was.
	   ``They put their numbers down, too,'' confided Yannick le Bihan,
who waited an hour with his girlfriend for the opportunity.
	   South African players were surprised at the warm reception.
	   ``I thought maybe it was going to be quiet, that we wouldn't
have support or people watching us,'' said defender Willem Jackson.
``They've made us feel real comfortable. It's just like a dream.''

Lebanon prime minister takes control of prisoner swap deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZEINA KARAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's prime minister stepped in
Thursday to save a prisoner swap deal with Israel, which is in
danger of unraveling following interference by a guerrilla group.
	   The proposed deal is aimed at securing the release of Lebanese
prisoners and bodies of dead guerrillas from Israeli custody. In
exchange, the Hezbollah guerrillas are supposed to give up the
remains of Israeli soldiers killed in Lebanon last year.
	   The deal was being mediated by Jean-Jacques Fresard, Beirut
delegate of the International Committee of the Red Cross, who for
months had ferried messages between Israel's government and Hariri
and the Hezbollah.
	   However, the deal was jeopardized after the Shiite Muslim Amal,
Hezbollah's rival, declared Wednesday it would not return the
remains of an Israeli soldier it holds unless it too was made a
party to the negotiations.
	   Seeking to salvage the negotiations, Hariri told Fresard
Thursday that he should not deal with any Lebanese group.
	   Fresard should refrain from contacting ``any official or
unofficial Lebanese party'' except for Hariri himself, a statement
issued by the prime minister's office said. It cited the
``sensitivity'' of the issue.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah says it holds most of the remains
of at least two Israeli soldiers left behind after a botched
commando raid Sept. 5, in which 12 Israeli soldiers were killed in
explosions and gunfire.
	   Amal is believed to hold the scalp of one of the soldiers.
	   Amal's latest position could delay the release of some 100
Lebanese prisoners and bodies of dead guerrillas by Israel.
	   Israel has refused to comment on the Amal stand but one
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a deal was still
possible.
	   The statement by Hariri's office said Thursday that negotiations
for arranging the deal are continuing.
	   The pro-Syrian Amal and the Shiite militant Hezbollah have been
locked in a power struggle for control of Lebanon's 1.2 million
Shiites, the country's largest sect. Their dispute also has moved
to the election ground where the two groups are contesting
Lebanon's staggered municipal elections. The last phase of the
voting is on Sunday when eastern Lebanon goes to the polls.

13th Asian Games preparation on track, say organizers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BK102

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Preparations for the 13th Asian Games
are nearly 90 percent complete and an operational test-run at all
major sport venues has been scheduled for October, the games'
organizers said Thursday.
	   Construction of all venues is on schedule and contractors are
expected to hand over the facilities at least three months before
the mid-December start of the Games, said Ridh Chavirat of the
Games' venue and accommodation committee.
	   Speaking at a news conference, he said timers and results boards
and their links to the Games' master computer system have been
installed at all the venues, and will be tested on Oct. 15.
	   Ridh said the facilities and personnel to conduct drug tests on
athletes have met the standard set by the International Olympic
Committee.
	   ``There were some concerns about five to six months ago about
whether the IOC would accredit Thailand's drug testing on
athletes,'' said Ridh. ``We have spent over 100 million baht (dlrs
2.3 million) to upgrade the facilities and personnel and we have
met the standard.''
	   Apai Chandanachulaka, deputy secretary for the games' activities
committee, said more than 12,000 police officers will be dispatched
to deal with about 500 VIPs, 10,000 athletes, and 1,200 referees,
along with an estimated 100,000 spectators for each day of the
games.
	   He also said a trial-run of the traffic control system will be
conducted one week before the game.
	   The head of the Olympic Council of Asia, Sheik Ahmad al-Fahad al
Sabah of Kuwait, raised concerns over Bangkok's infamous traffic
jams during an inspection visit in April.
	   Maj. Gen. Pichit Khuandejakoob, deputy secretary for the games'
security and traffic committee, said however that traffic is
expected to decrease by about 30 to 40 percent during the
competition because all schools will be closed for the duration of
the games.
	   The general public will also be encouraged to park their cars at
18 selected spots and take shuttle buses to the site, he said.

	   PENANG, Tues. - Taps ran dry for 200,000 consumers on the island
from noon today when a pipe on mainland Penang sprung a leak.
	   Water supply to 40 per cent of the island, in areas south of
Bukit Dumbar up to Teluk Kumbar and parts of Georgetown, was
disrupted when a 140cm supply pipe began leaking.
	   It was located along Jalan Siram and Jalan Heng Choon Thian in
Butterworth.
	   State Infrastructure Committee chairman Datuk Dr Hilmi Yahaya
told reporters that water supply was expected to be restored to
affected areas by 10pm today.
	   Today's incident adds to nearly a week of water disruptions at
various parts of the island.
	   On Saturday, four areas on the island were without water for
more than half a day, while Sunday saw residents in Island Park
without water for more than 17 hours.
	   ``The PWA is in the process of changing old pipes in certain
critical areas where breakages happen frequently,'' Dr Hilmi said
at the Penang State Legislative Assembly building.
	   He said PWA had over the past four years spent RM5 million
replacing old pipes.
	   Also present was Penang Water Authority general manager Lee Yow
Ching.

	   The Ameer of Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh, Professor Golam Azam,
said here today the government has made the Bangalees second class
citizens in the hill districts by signing the CHT treaty with the
insurgents.
	   He was addressing a meeting at the old court house building
after the long march.
	   After the long marchers had left the place, a peace procession
led by Dipankar Talukder, MP, was brought out in the town. However,
no untoward incidents were reported.
	   Golam Azam said the twelve crore people of the country would not
accept the ``unconstitutional'' agreement.
	   The Jamaat chief announced they would hold rallies and
processions across the country on June 22 and gherao the Prime
Minister's office in the first week of July as part of the
seven-party alliances next programme against the CHT accord.
	   He also appealed to the tribal people not to be isolated from
the main stream of citizens of the country.
	   The motor-convoy of the long marchers reached here at about 4 pm
and they left the town for Dhaka after several hours.
	   The long marchers were accorded reception at Betbunia, Ranirhat,
and Manikchhari points on the Chittagong-Rangamati route.

Brazil fans need not ``despair'' over mediocre opener, Zagallo
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ Heading for the team bus, team
captain Dunga was asked what Brazil's win in the World Cup opener
meant to the defending world champions.
	   ``Three points and a little tranquility,'' he replied
succinctly.
	   There's little chance of that. Brazil has the points, but the
team's inconsistent play in a 2-1 victory over Scotland did little
to allay the anxiety of its demanding fans.
	   Brazil needed an own-goal by defender Tommy Boyd in the 73rd
minute to down the tenacious Scots, who have never passed the first
round of World Cup play in eight tries.
	   ``We got the win, but without the brilliance expected,''
admitted Cesar Sampaio, who scored Brazil's first goal and then
conceded the penalty that led to Scotland's score.
	   ``The problem is that, because of our history, people always
expect more from us,'' he said. ``I know that with two goals many
teams would be satisfied, but not us.''
	   Indeed, Brazil is a victim of its own success. With the great
Pele as a yardstick for players and a record four Cup titles in
1958, 1962, 1970 and 1994, Brazilians hold their team to a higher
standard.
	   They expect ``the art, the magic that has always been the
calling card of the national team,'' said Tostao, a member of the
1970 Cup team that some consider the best Brazilian side ever.
	   Brazil did show glimmers of brilliance against Scotland, mainly
at the feet of Ronaldo. The two-time FIFA Player of the Year drew
on a repertoire of stutter-step dribbles, feints and sudden changes
of speed that created panic in the Scottish backfield and forced
goalie Jim Leighton into acrobatic saves.
	   But the midfield _ once the domain of maestros such as Gerson,
Rivelino and Zico _ seemed flat. In a rare half-time substitution,
coach Mario Zagallo sent in Leonardo for an apathetic Giovanni.
	   Brazil's defense also looked disjointed. The Scots found an
avenue on the left side, where Roberto Carlos was often caught
upfield and fullback Aldair, who recovered Tuesday from a leg
injury, was slow to cover.
	   Zagallo admitted that the team often was ``just decent'' but
promised Brazil would improve during the tournament. A member of
all four Cup winners as player, coach or team coordinator, Zagallo
says he dreams of reviving the elegant play of Brazil's golden era.
	   ``I was part of the beautiful soccer of 1958, 1962, 1970,'' he
said before the game. ``Our objective is 'art soccer' above all.''
	   For now, he'll take the three points and the lead in Group A.
Norway and Morocco, which tied 2-2 on Wednesday, have one point,
while Scotland has none.
	   ``Brazil is a team that starts to grow game by game,'' he said.
``It's too early to despair.''
	   For any other team, ``despair'' might seem an odd word to use
for a winner and group leader. But not for Brazil.

	   I MET my child's class teacher for the first time during the
school's Open Day. I found out he qualified for his teaching
certificate two years ago from one of the oldest teacher training
colleges in the country. I came away with the impression that he is
a very energetic and dedicated teacher.
	   Meeting teachers on Open Day is about finding out a child's
performance and areas where parents can help at home. For me, it
was also to find out about the person who has been entrusted to
help educate my child. My meeting with the teacher made me realise
a few other things. For example, I now know why the teacher had
changed my daughter's place in the classroom.
	   He said he had moved her to sit next to a ``lazier'' and
``talkative'' girl in the hope that the latter would be more
motivated by being seated next to a ``better'' student. He hoped I
would help him achieve this objective.
	   I had objected to the change in a letter to him a few months ago
when my daughter complained that she was unable to concentrate
because her ``partner'' kept talking to her. She also disliked the
fact that the latter kept copying her work. It was very
distracting, she said. Sometimes, because of all this, she failed
to copy everything on the board, and this ``agonised'' her. Hence,
my little one prefered her previous partner who was more like her
and was equally serious about the learning process.
	   I walked away feeling a little disappointed, not with the
teacher but perhaps with the system. Being an educator, I fully
appreciate what the teacher is attempting to do. He is just being a
good teacher. His philosophy is to help the weaker students get
better and to reduce the gap between the better students and the
weaker ones. He actually said this before I left. This is one
philosophy I can agree with in spite of the fact that the
``cleverer'' students would get shortchanged. For the sake of the
``weaker'' students, I would just have to get my child to attain
her potential by working with her individually at home.
	   Now, what has all this got to do with the Internet, the focus of
all my writing? First of all, I realise that meetings such as the
one above could have been achieved on-line. Had I understood the
teacher's intention, I would have been able to ``comfort'' my child
much earlier. I would have also encouraged her to ``help'' her new
partner and suggest a few ways that she can. In a way, this would
be helping the class teacher achieve his objective. As an educator,
I enjoy seeing all children succeed. Every child has the potential
to succeed but opportunities must exist.
	   Had the Internet been used, or rather had there been a school
website, I could have ``met'' the teacher on-line, discussed the
new seating arrangement, understood his philosophy and help in the
little ways that I could as both parent and educator. And, this is
where the LETSnet team's suggestion of using the Internet to
strengthen the lines of communication among parents, teachers,
students and the larger community will work. Open Days are held
once a year, and the Open Day I attended was the first since the
school opened for the new academic session five months ago.
	   Had parents been able to communicate with the teacher from day
one, the teacher could have made better progress in the classroom.
On the other hand, I can also see that some parents may be very
demanding and expect the teacher to focus on their child more than
any other child. This can also be a problem. However, problems such
as this can be avoided by making things clear from the beginning
that parents are expected to cooperate for the benefit of the whole
classroom. I do not see this as a problem actually. Most of the
parents I have met are professionals who have learned to expect
less than perfect standards in today's education system.
	   There is so much to be ironed out: lack of classrooms, poor
physical conditions, lack of funds, etc.
	   To indicate the other strengths of the Internet, let me quote
part of the theoretical rationale of the LETSnet team
(http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/letsnet/): ``Recent advances in
Internet technology allows teachers to strengthen connections
between schools and their communities. Through the use of the
Internet, classrooms can provide parents and the larger community
with current snapshots of students' work and curricular projects in
action, as well as better facilitating the learning process for
students. For instance, many teachers who use the Internet have
also chosen to publish parent newsletters on the Internet.
	   Students who have missed class can use the Internet to review
the lessons, both by communicating with the teacher over the e-mail
and by using the World Wide Web to access assignments and notes
that the teacher provides.''
	   The LETSnet team also suggested that students explore the
contributions of community organisations and develop web pages for
them. I would advocate this only after schools have set up an
interactive and useful school website.
	   Visit the LETSnet website for other suggestions.
	   I have concluded reviewing the 10 big ideas from the LETSnet
team and I am sure some of the ideas can be adopted by local
teachers. Many schools have successfully integrated the use of the
Internet. However, how many of our local schools have the necessary
equipment and facilities to try out some of these ideas? Very few.
	   I hope it will not take another generation of students before we
make progress in this area.

	   Foreseeing a midterm election at any time, Jatiya Party Chairman
HM Ershad today urged his partymen to be organised as the people
want his party to see in power again.
	   ``People expect a lot from Jatiya Party and it will have to take
over the charge of the country to fulfil their hopes and
aspirations,'' he said addressing a public meeting at the Aralia
Maidan in Baniachang thana.
	   The meeting was organised on the occasion of his two-day visit
to Habiganj.
	   Presided over by Abid Ali Chowdhury, the rally was addressed,
among others, by JP Secretary General Naziur Rahman Manzu, Abdul
Mukit Khan MP, Abu Lais Mohammad Mobin Chowdhury MP, Nasir Uddin
Chowdhury MP and other party leaders.
	   Describing JP as the party of development and progress, Ershad
said each and every part of the country still bears the signs of
development and progress achieved during the JP's regime.
	   Criticising both Awami League and BNP, the former President said
AL is the government of loadshedding, while BNP was the government
of lace-cutting, according to a JP press release.
	   ``We supported Awami League while forming the government as they
had begged pardon for their previous misdeeds, but in the last two
years they could not accomplish any single sublime thing, except
terrorism, price hike and loadshedding,'' the deposed President
told the meeting.

	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will visit both India and Pakistan
within next two weeks, a top official of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs said here last night.
	   Foreign Secretary Mustafizur Rahman told the BSS that the
Bangladesh leader held telephone conversation with Pakistan Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif last evening. She will visit Pakistan on June
24.
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who had telephoned Indian Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee yesterday evening, will go to New
Delhi on June 16, Rahman said.
	   Rahman said both the visits will be brief and the Prime Minister
will return home on the same days.
	   The Foreign Secretary informed that the Pakistan visit is being
little delayed as Nawaz Sharif will be on a visit outside the
country from June 13 to June 20, he added.
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina expressed her desire to visit India
and Pakistan in separate letters addressed to their leaders in the
aftermath of nuclear tests carried out by both the countries that
created tension in the region. In her letter to the two leaders,
Sheikh Hasina expressed her desire to discuss with them the matters
of mutual interest and other issues.
	   The letters were handed over to the High Commissioners of the
two countries a couple of days ago.

Villa striker under fire after beating up girlfriend
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Aston Villa stiker Stan Collymore is
losing support from fans and sponsors after attacking celebrity
girlfriend Ulrika Jonsson in a Paris bar.
	   Sportswear company Diadora said Thursday it is reconsidering its
five-year 2.5 million pound (dlrs 4.1 million) sponsorship deal
with Collymore in the wake of enormous public backlash against the
troubled star.
	   The Birmingham press and local radio programs were inundated
with letters and calls from fans saying that Aston Villa should
fire Collymore.
	   Aston Villa officials said they plan to speak to Collymore,
still believed to be in Paris, as soon as possible regarding his
playing future.
	   Diadora also wants a meeting with Collymore to review the
remaining two years on his contract.
	   Diadora managing director Andrew Ronnie said he was ``amazed''
by reports of Collymore jumping over a bar in a Scottish pub in
Paris on Tuesday to attack Jonsson on the eve of Scotland's World
Cup opener against Brazil.
	   ``We were very surprised by what Stan did. We pay him a
substantial amount of money,'' Ronnie said. ``He has always been
very pleasant to work with and a nice guy _ we are amazed.''
	   Aston Villa shareholder and vocal soccer commentator Tommy
Docherty said Villa should ``get rid'' of Collymore as soon as
possible because he had let the club and its supporters down.
	   ``It may be a personal matter but it still affects the good name
of the club and the supporters,'' he said.
	   Collymore issued a public apology Wednesday but Jonsson
announced she was breaking off her relationship with him.
Thursday's tabloid newspapers featured front-page photos of
Jonsson, with welts and bruises on her face.

	   PENANG, Tues. - Penang appears to be fast becoming a gateway for
syndicates bringing in and flying out foreigners with false or
tampered Malaysian passports and other travel documents.
	   To date, the State Immigration Department's enforcement unit has
detained 12 foreigners found with forged travel documents at the
Bayan Lepas International Airport.
	   In the latest incident on May 21, two Chinese were found with
tampered Malaysian passports and fake Malaysian identity cards.
	   A Singaporean who was accompanying them was also picked up.
	   State Immigration deputy assistant director Bardril Mohd Yusof
said today the foreigners were nabbed when they were about to leave
for Melbourne, Australia, adding that all three would be charged
soon.
	   Bardril said the Chinese were found to have violated section
6(3) of the Immigration Act 1959/63 (Amended 1997) for illegally
entering the country, and contravened section 12 (1)(a) of the
Passport Act 1966 for possession of passports which had been forged
by replacing the original passport holders' photographs with
theirs.
	   If convicted, they could be fined up to a maximum of RM10,000 or
five years' jail, or both.
	   Bardril said the two passports carried by the Chinese were
stolen from two men in Johor Baru early this year.
	   ``Our initial investigations revealed that the Chinese had paid
a Singapore-based syndicate S$4,500 (RM10,350) for each passport.
	   ``They (the Chinese), accompanied by the Singaporean, had left
Singapore for Johor Baru on May 19 with the forged documents.
	   ``They then travelled by car to Penang and checked into a
hotel,'' he said, adding that all three had purchased air tickets
to Melbourne from a travel agency in Penang.
	   Bardril said the Chinese had used the forged passports to enter
Thailand to obtain Australian visas.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka staged a remarkable fight
back to bundle out New Zealand for 193 and take a 13-run first
inning lead at the end of the second day Thursday of the third and
final Test.
	   New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming was the last out for 78,
bowled by paceman Pramodya Wickremasinghe minutes before the
scheduled close after facing 231 balls and stroking eight
boundaries.
	   At one stage, the Kiwis looked to be cruising toward a
comfortable total with Fleming and Mathew Horne (35) striking the
ball without any trouble.
	   But a controversial dismissal of Horne by off-spinner Aravinda
de Silva terminated the 64-run fourth wicket partnership.
	   The ball appeared to have hit Horne on the front pad and was
held by Marvan Atapattu at forward-short-leg. Horne didn't look
pleased at the ruling, and left the crease after some hesitation.
	   Horne's exit brought about a collapse as the tourists slumped
from 94 for three to 143 for seven with Fleming being the only
front-line batsman in the middle.
	   Craig McMillan sacrificed his wicket by leaping down the track
for a big hit off de Silva, missing completely, and being stumped
by keeper Kaluwitharana.
	   Adam Parore then stroked the ball with confidence but was caught
leg before wicket by de Silva for 19. He too didn't look happy with
the decision.
	   Resuming after tea at 136 for six, New Zealand lost Chris Cairns
run out from a direct hit at the striker's end by mid-on fielder
Mahela Jayawardena, after Fleming played and called for a single.
	   Earlier before lunch, Craig Spearman was out for 4, Bryan Young
for 2, and Nathan Astle for 16.
	   Spearman was caught by de Silva at mid-on off Pramodya
Wickremasinghe, after which Young was held by Marvan Atapattu at
silly-point off Niroshan Bandaratilleke.
	   Astle was then caught by Atapattu off Kumara Dharmasena.
	   Fleming was lucky to survive when Dharmasena missed a return
catch when he was on six.
	   Earlier, the Kiwis needed just 12 minutes to wrap up Sri Lanka
for 206 from their overnight 200 for 8.
	   Paceman Chris Cairns took the wicket of last man Muttiah
Muralitharan to complete his fifth 5-wicket haul in Test cricket,
with figures of 5 for 62.
	   The series is tied 1-1.

New Berlin art museum unites masterpieces divided by communism

	   BERLIN (AP) _ Reuniting art divided by communism, Berlin opens
its new museum for 13th-18th century European paintings this week,
a long-awaited restoration of the city's once-celebrated
collection.
	   ``With the reopening, the Berlin museum will once again reach
world recognition,'' museum director Jan Kelch said Thursday at a
press conference. After a weekend of celebrations, the museum opens
to the public on Sunday.
	   The new Berlin Painting Gallery, located in the city's
commercial center, Potsdamer Platz, reestablishes the collection
housed from 1830 until World War II in the Altes Museum. Its
masterpieces include works by Duerer, Rembrandt, Frans Hals,
Botticelli and Gainsborough.
	   During the war, the Nazis stored the paintings in salt mines or
air-raid shelters, where most of them survived undamaged. Under
communism, however, the collection was divided, just as the city
was.
	   Paintings hid from bombing raids in the city's eastern sectors
stayed in the Bode Museum in then-East Berlin, behind the Berlin
Wall. Paintings that wound up in West Berlin were displayed or
housed in the Dalhem Museum.
	   The Berlin Painting Gallery joins 1,250 painting from former
East Berlin with 1,650 from the former West.

	   Garment manufacturers and exporters yesterday sought the
intervention of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to increase the
planned 30 per cent quota for US market.
	   The garment entrepreneurs , terming the sector as an exclusively
bank managed one, also called for stopping ''harassment `` of the
exporters by a section of bankers.
	   They urged the government to pursue the World Trade Organisation
(WTO) to extend the phasing out time of the multi-fibre agreement
for another ten years after the year 2004 to help Bangladesh
develop its infant backward linkage industries, which is essential
for the survival of ready-made garments sector.
	   Leaders of the country's ready-made garments sector came up with
scores of issues of the sector in a round table held at the
Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA)
conference room.
	   Noted economist and researcher Debapriya Bhattacharya spoke on
the occasion as the chief guest.
	   Presided over by BGMEA President Mostafa Golam Quddus, the
interactive was participated, among others, by Capt (retd) Anisur
Rahman Sinha, SM Al-Hussaini, Engr Nurul Haq Sikdar, Benazir Ahmed,
Shamsur Rahman and Admer Vander Heyden, a manufacturer.
	   Quddus said despite creating job opportunities for over 1.4
million people and fetching the maximum of the foreign currency for
the country, the manufacturers are labelled as defaulters. This
cannot go, he said, adding the sector is a self made one.
	   He sought review of the Banking Company Act of 1997 for the
survival and growth of the booming garments sector.
	   Anisur Rahman Sinha said it should be ensured that the garment
units of the EPZs follow the conditions they agreed before setting
up the industries. Congestion in the Chittagong Port, erratic power
supply, the law and order and customs issues also came up for
discussion in the round table. Speaking on the occasion Debapriya
Bhattacharya said while continuous devaluation is a temporary
solution for benefiting country's exports, it should be
unanticipated to keep the price unaffected.
	   He said although no industry can grow with cash incentives for
an indefinite period, the government should not cut any such
facility all on a sudden.
	   Stressing the need for an agreement on a long term view both by
the government and the trade bodies for the comparative benefit,
Bhattacharya said he is confident that Bangladesh garments export
would survive the challenges of the quota free market after 2004.
He said the sector has made a 32 per cent growth in the first eight
months of the current fiscal, meaning the sector has contributed 70
per cent to the total industrial growth in the same period.
	   Referring to the post-nuclear tests perspective in the
sub-continent, he said the sector leaders can try to harness the
eventual market potentials arising out of the situation.

	   A PRELIMINARY study to gauge the escalating overhead costs at
Penang Port Sdn Bhd was used when the port authority announced the
retrenchment of more than 700 workers this year, the House was
told.
	   Syed Ameruddin Syed Ahmad (BN-Teluk Kumbar) said the study was
carried out by a New Zealand-based consultancy firm which was paid
RM800,000.
	   ``The firm was initially to be paid RM1 million, but since the
study was incomplete, the full payment was not effected,'' he said,
adding that overhead costs were bound to increase at PPSB which in
November last year alone, promoted 26 of its managers.
	   Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu Koon (BN-Tanjung Bunga) in
reply said the matter was an administrative one which needed to be
referred to the Penang Port Commission and Transport Ministry since
it came under the purview of the Federal Government.
	   When asked by Permatang Pasir Assemblyman Ahmad Saad if
reinstating the free port and duty-free status to Penang would
assist in economic recovery, Koh said: ``Penang island's role as a
free port in the 1960s was limited to relatively low trading
volumes between Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia, while many items
sold at the duty-free shops at the time are now all tax-free
anyway, so it would make no major difference.''
	   He said development efforts for thion would
also imply similar recovery for Penang.
	   ``We must, therefore, be psychologically prepared for the
possibility that the situation may get worse before it gets
better,'' he said, adding that it was important for the people of
Penang to close ranks and be willing to make more sacrifices.

Interior Minister accuses mass-circulation daily of distortion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Interior Minister Manfred Kanther accused
the mass-circulation daily Bild Zeitung on Thursday of distortion
and fear-mongering for a front-page report on acts of rail sabotage
this year.
	   By citing ``secret files,'' the report suggests that officials
were withholding information pertinent to last week's deadly crash
of a high-speed InterCity Express train near Eschede in northern
Germany, Kanther said.
	   The tabloid is seeking to ``raise fears through the conscious
distortion of facts,'' Kanther said in a release.
	   The Bild Zeitung report, under the headline, ``Bild Uncovers
Secret Files,'' cited an Interior Ministry document detailing 40
acts of sabotage on Germany's rails this year.
	   In his release, Kanther noted that the incidents listed in the
report were not secrets at all; many were under investigation and
some had been widely reported in German media.
	   ``This (report) has nothing to do with train operation or safety
questions, nor does it have anything to do with Eschede,'' Kanther
said.
	   The ministry compiled the report from information requested from
police investigating the individual incidents, most of which are
believed linked to anti-nuclear protests, Kanther said.
	   Anti-nuclear demonstrators typically target Germany's rail
system in an attempt to demonstrate that trains are an unsafe means
of transporting nuclear waste. Incidents of rail tampering rose
earlier this year as activists organized to block a shipment from
being moved from Bavaria to the north.
	   Investigators have not ruled out sabotage as a cause of the June
11 crash of ICE 884, but they have said they have no evidence
suggesting tampering.
	   The wreck was caused by a broken wheel, but it was still unclear
whether the wheel broke due to a defect, metal fatigue or some
outside force.
	   A federal Transport Ministry official on Thursday again
emphasized that investigators ``have absolutely no indication''
that the accident was the result of an attack.
	   The most serious of the incidents mentioned in the Bild report
was track damage to a high-speed InterCity Express line between
Hanover and Braunschweig in northern Germany on March 14.
	   Widely reported in Germany at the time, saboteurs laid concrete
slabs on the rails, blocked a switch with wooden wedges and pieces
of metal, damaged a grounding cable and loosened screws on the
rails.
	   The lead locomotive was destabilized, but did not derail, and
passengers were let off safely.

Kohl, Buzek to dedicate international youth center

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kohl, Buzek quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KRZYZOWA, Poland (AP) _ In a show of Polish-German friendship,
Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl met
Thursday in a Silesian town to open a youth center and to hold
talks on European integration.
	   Youth center sponsors welcomed Kohl and Buzek with bread and
salt, a traditional greeting in the southwestern Silesian region
that was part of Germany before 1945.
	   Instead of cutting a ribbon to inaugurate the International
Center for Youth Meetings, Kohl and Buzek tied three ribbons
together _ white and red ribbons to represent Poland and blue for a
united Europe.
	   ``Germans and Poles today have a historical chance to shape and
expand mutual relations in the spirit of reconciliation, agreement
and full confidence as neighbors,'' Kohl said.
	   Afterward, he and Buzek discussed Poland's planned membership
into the European Union.
	   The town of Krzyzowa, located 130 kilometers (80 miles) from the
German border, was a meeting place for Nazi resisters during World
War II. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, it became a symbolic
spot for Polish-German reconciliation.
	   ``This place is a symbol of resistance against totalitarian
government,'' said Buzek. ``It is an extraordinary evidence of
links between Polish and German history.''
	   It was here eight years ago that Kohl and Poland's first
non-communist prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, spontaneously
embraced during a Catholic Mass at a point when participants
normally shake hands. That meeting helped pave the way for a
historic 1991 Polish-German friendship treaty.
	   The German government gave 30 million marks (dlrs 17 million)
toward establishing the youth center on the former estate of Count
Hellmuth James von Moltke, a member of the group that plotted the
1944 assassination attempt on Hitler. The conspirators were hanged.
	   After meeting Thursday with three widows of the conspirators,
Kohl said: ``Their husbands were murdered by the Nazis because they
supported the ideals which today are reality: co-habitation of
people in Europe in peace and freedom.''
	   The center has 116 beds, a 220-seat auditorium and a gymnasium.
In operation since 1994, it has housed school and youth groups from
Europe and Israel.
	   ``Our main goal is to build tolerance between religions, nations
and people of different outlooks,'' said Edward Wasiewicz,
secretary general of the Krzyzowa Foundation, the Polish-German
group that sponsored the youth center.

	   Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed yesterday informed in
Parliament that a new industrial policy will be announced soon
envisaging measures to match with the free-market economy.
	   He said the government will privatise all the profitable and
loosing units of public sector in phases to operate in competition
in the free market.
	   Replying to Master Mujibur Rahman (AL) during the question hour,
the minister said 54 textile, jute, steel, sugar, chemical,
forestry and other sectors have been identified to sell out during
the current fiscal year.
	   The process is underway either to close down or sell the loosing
public sector mills and factories.
	   Till December 97, he said, 11 mills of textile sector were
closed down and their workers off loaded under the voluntary
retirement programme by giving them all financial benefits.
	   The Industries Minister presented a list of public sector mills
and factories with year wise financial loss incurred since the
nationalisation.

U.S. labor secretary optimistic on child labor convention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said Thursday
she is ``optimistic about the outcome'' of discussions on a new
world convention aimed at abolishing the most extreme forms of
child labor.
	   She highlighted U.S. efforts to enforce child labor laws,
including this spring's Operation Salad Bowl, which sent inspectors
to 50 of the nation's farmlands.
	   ``We must start at home,'' Herman told the committee working on
the convention at the U.N. labor agency's annual conference. ``One
child working in abusive conditions is one too many.''
	   Countries are ``moving toward a common consensus on a resolution
that can be adopted,'' Herman told a news conference later.
	   International Labor Organization Director-General Michel
Hansenne and developing countries have said the new convention will
have to aim for realistic targets.
	   The ILO conference began last week with the arrival a global
march against child labor in Geneva. It ends next week.

	   The Senate's Foreign Relations Committee decided Tuesday to
attend next week's Mexico-U.S.
	   Interparliamentary Reunion despite calls from some legislators
to boycott the meeting.
	   Foreign Relations Committee President Martha Lara Alatorre made
the announcement after a meeting in which the Party of the
Democratic Revolution (PRD) fraction proposed the meeting be
postponed.
	   The PRD relented, however, after senators from the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) and National Action Party (PAN) voted in
favor of attending the meeting, to be held June 19-21 in Morelia,
Mich.
	   PRD Senator Jorge Calderon Salazar said his party harbored no
regrets about its decision and would participate fully in the
upcoming event.
	   ``We will not only seek to participate in the Interparliamentary
reunion but to construct common agreements in the defense of our
sovereignty and national interest,'' Calderon Salazar said.
	   After the controversy over Operation Casablanca, legislators
publicly threatened to boycott the meeting. But the senators
decided that bringing their complaints directly to their U.S.
counterparts.
	   On Monday, Arturo Nunez Jimenez, the PRI Chamber of Deputies
delegation coordinator, also spoke out in favor of the meeting,
saying it was an ``adequate instrument'' for protesting Mexican
concerns over U.S. interventionism.
	   Operation Casablanca and the ``disrespectful'' letter from U.S.
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott in which he chastised President
Ernesto Zedillo for criticizing the U.S. money laundering
investigation, are important concerns PRD Senator Calderon said.
	   But those issues have been pushed aside since the emergence of
Operation Casablanca will also be discussed in Morelia.

	   ``Non-availability of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders
has recently taken a serious twist in the 16 northern districts,
with cylinders selling at Tk 600 to 700, more than double the
actual price.
	   The crisis has been attributed to short supply and improper
distribution systems, the users alleged.
	   The total number of LPG users in the northern districts is
around 25,049, with Bogra coming in first with 4,937 users.
	   Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) sources said this has
been happening because of a continuous short supply of LPG
cylinders relative to the growing demand.
	   Sources said the demand for LPG cylinders now stands at around
100,000.
	   The situation also allows for profiteering, with alleged help of
some BPC officials.
	   The distribution companies - Padma, Meghna and Jamuna - supplied
around 2,22,730 gas cylinders to the districts over the last 10
months. But this could meet only 5.38 per cent of the total demand.
The requirement over the period was around 10 lakh gas cylinders.
	   BPC sources said 22,560 gas cylinders were supplied to these
districts against an estimated demand for 70,000 in August, '97.
There was a supply of 34,400 cylinders against the same demand in
the following month.
	   Supply was 29,920 in October and 32,560 in November. BPC
arranged for a supply of 24,099 cylinders, and reduced its supply
to 23,832 cylinders in January '98.
	   Supply was 12,345 cylinders in February, 14,900 in March, 14,502
in April and 13,612 in May this year.
	   LPG cylinders were introduced to the region in the '80s. Since
then, the demand for LPG has been gradually rising. Distribution
agents are still being appointed in the districts. But the supply
did not increased proportionately.
	   Over the period, except in very few cases, the users could not
get the cylinders at the fixed price.
	   BPC sources said on some occasions that the organisation is
unduly pressed to appoint dealers and agents for LPG distribution;
but it fails to arrange for increased supply.
	   There are 191 licensed LPG dealers in the northern region, the
sources further said, including 16 in Pabna while there are around
70 unlicensed ones.
	   With 28,778 cylinders distributed in July '97, the BPC
divisional office in Bogra said that supply has been gradually
decreasing.
	   Import of refined oil for irrigation purposes has caused the
slump in LPG production, BPC sources said. Around 2 per cent of LP
gas is obtained as by-product in the petroleum refining process.
	   The Eastern Refinery produces only 18,000 tonnes of LP gas a
year, but this is far short in view of the demand.
	   The refinery, which is expected to be overhauled soon, stands a
chance of producing less LP gas for a certain period pushing the
crisis to the brink.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - Beginning last year, the Public Service
Department has been collecting an average of RM1 million a month
from its study loan borrowers compared to just RM100,000 a month
previously.
	   This follows intensified efforts by PSD from late 1996, like
going to universities for particulars on graduates, getting lists
of those returning overseas from Malaysian Students Department and
going after the guarantors.
	   PSD deputy director-general II, Datuk Khalil Hussain said today
one of the previous setbacks was in tracing the borrowers as often
they did not register with the department upon graduation.
	   ``Now with the aggressive efforts, we believe we can collect
more than RM1 million a month,'' Khalil told reporters after
launching the 12th management development programme.
	   Eleven officers are participating in the programme, initiated by
the British Malaysian Industry and Trade Association and the PSD,
to enable senior Government officers to gain hands-on experience in
the private sector.
	   Khalil was representing PSD director-general Tan Sri Dr Mazlan
Ahmad at the function. Also present were British High Commissioner
to Malaysia David Moss, BMITA chairman, Tim O'Brien, and PSD
Director of Training, Dr Abdul Rahman Idris.
	   Khalil, who heads an internal PSD committee on loan recovery,
said each year, PSD gives out more than RM500 million worth of
scholarships and study loans.
	   The study loan with a 25-year repayment period was introduced in
the mid-1980s during the last economic recession. Officials said
although the sum given out annually was huge, total repayment was
much less as students with good academic achievement were given a
hefty discount, and due to the staggered repayment.
	   Khalil said PSD normally sent out five reminders to defaulters
after which the cases would be referred to the Attorney-General's
Chambers for action.
	   The department has this year given out some 60,000 study loan
application forms to universities and the Institut Teknologi Mara.
	   The closing date for applications has been extended to June 16
from May 30 due to differing time when universities start their new
academic sessions. Last year the PSD gave out 15,000 study loans
and 3,000 scholarships.
	   Companies sponsoring the management development programme are
Malaysian Tobacco Company Bhd, Hongkong Bank Malaysia Bhd, ICI
Paints Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Teamwork Corporation Sdn Bhd, Standard
Chartered Bank Malaysia Bhd, Rothmans of Pall Mall (M) Sdn Bhd, BP
Malaysian Sdn BHd, Unilever Malaysia and Commercial Union. Glaxo
Wellcome and Malayan Cement will take two candidates each.
	   The programme, funded by British interests, includes a
contribution from the British Government. In the light of the
economic downturn, the programme will be carried out in Malaysia.
	   BMITA was formed in 1963, and made up of more than 200 companies
and individuals.

	   The demand for US dollar in the local forex market yesterday was
steady and the exchange rate was about Taka 46.45. In the kerb
market US dollar cash notes traded between 47.50 per cent and 47.70
per cent.
	   The call money market was a bit tighter as there was a talk that
nationalised banks had large payment obligations and to meet this,
they called their call lending. The call rate ranged between 10 per
cent and 11.75 per cent.
	   US dollar again posted a fresh seven year high against yen
amidst concerns that China and Hong Kong would devalue their
respective currencies. Yen's continuous sliding against dollar has
already put pressure on Asia's other export led growth economies
like Hong Kong, Australia etc. China and Hong Kong are already
considering devaluing their currencies if yen continues to go down
against dollar. International markets are also keeping and watchful
eye on the Bundesbank council meeting amid ongoing speculation of a
German interest rate rise. In the subcontinent, Indian and Pakistan
currencies are against dollar as a result of their renewed arms
race.

Three detained in killing of opposition editor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three people, including a former employee of a
regional administration, have been detained in connection with the
slaying of an opposition editor earlier this week, a news agency
reported Thursday.
	   Larisa Yudina, editor of the Soviet Kalmykia Today newspaper and
regional co-chairman of the liberal opposition Yabloko party,
disappeared Sunday after leaving her home in Elista, capital of the
Kalmyk Republic in southern Russia.
	   The editor was found dead Monday, with multiple knife wounds and
a fractured skull, Russian media have reported.
	   Citing investigators in the case, the Interfax news agency said
that among the three suspects detained was a former employee in
Kalmyk President Kirsan Yulimzhinov's administration.
	   Investigators haven't ruled out that the killing resulted from
``hooliganism'' or a robbery attempt, Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported
Thursday. But the Yabloko party, headed by economist Grigory
Yavlinsky, and most Moscow newspapers have alleged that it was
politically motivated.
	   Yudina was unrelenting in her criticism of Yulimzhinov's
policies, her colleagues have said.
	   ``Who killed the journalist isn't yet known,'' wrote the
Izvestiya daily in a commentary. ``But it doesn't take a composite
sketch to recognize in this political face the familiar traits of
the totalitarian regime, where both people and laws have no
rights.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - The Agriculture Ministry has no plans to
control the price of Super grade rice, said its Minister Datuk Amar
Dr Sulaiman Daud.
	   Dr Sulaiman said however, that his ministry would continue to
monitor rice price movements, and that the Padi and Rice Price
Control and Monitoring division has been told to prepare a report
detailing the prices of Super grade rice, both local and imported,
and the reasons for the increase.
	   It was reported that Super grade rice AAA was being sold at
RM3.80 a kilogramme.
	   Padiberas Nasional Bhd yesterday denied it was responsible for
the price increase, and said it sold Super grade AAA at RM2.85 a kg
at its outlets.
	   Super grade rice is the only one where the price is floated.
Premium and Standard grade rice are under price control.
	   ``At the moment, this will remain. But if the price keeps
increasing, the government might have a rethink.
	   ``However, we also have to consider that price controls might
have an adverse impact on the industry,'' he said.
	   Dr Sulaiman said he would meet wholesalers, retailers and
millers if the division's report shows a needless price increase
for local Super grade rice.
	   He said early this year, millers promised not to hike prices
when the government allowed a rise in padi prices.
	   Although Malaysia had a policy of 65 per cent self-sufficiency,
it was now producing about 71 per cent of its rice needs, said Dr
Sulaiman when speaking to reporters after meeting a Myanmar
delegation led by Commerce Minister Major-General Kyaw Than.
	   The other members include Deputy Minister of Agriculture and
Irrigation Brig-Gen Khin Maung, Deputy Minister of Livestock
Breeding and Fisheries U Aung Thein and Deputy Minister of Energy U
Tin Tun.
	   He said Bernas will import 5,000 tonnes of ``pearl rice'' from
Myanmar, to test the Malaysian market, in a move to diversify the
sources of rice imports.
	   ``Myanmar doesn't normally allow rice exports but has agreed to
export 5,000 tonnes to Malaysia,'' he said.
	   He said this was part of the flexibility and consideration for
Malaysian investors, as promised by the Myanmar delegation.
	   For instance, he said Myanmar allowed land to be leased for 30
years and renewed for another 15 years.
	   But Malaysians planning long-term investments there would be
allowed longer land tenancies. Myanmar has over 25 million hectares
of arable land.
	   Myanmar will also consider allowing investments in fisheries and
livestock export, said Dr Sulaiman.

	   Power situation is expected to improve within a week as soon as
the 3rd unit of Ghorashal power station resumes generation,
minister without portfolio Noor Uddin Khan told the House
yesterday.
	   ``The repair work may take a week to complete. Then we'll get
210 megawatts additional power,'' Khan, the former Energy Minister
said.
	   Replying to several questions from both treasury bench and
opposition MPs, Khan narrated different government measures to
tackle the present power crisis.
	   Some of the MPs particularly enquired about the government steps
to ensure uninterrupted power supply during the World Cup Football.
	   The minister said the government was trying its best to increase
generation and maintain adequate power supply across the country.
	   Replying to a question from Shahidul Islam of BNP, he claimed
that the load-shedding situation particularly improved with the
official decision to ensure closure of the shops in the cities and
towns by 7 pm.
	   Besides, he pointed out, it had been possible to save 80
megawatt of electricity daily by disconnecting illegal power
connections in 64 districts.
	   ``We hope that we'll be able to disconnect all the illegal
electricity connections within the next two months,'' Noor Uddin
said.
	   About problem of low-voltage, he said DESA had already installed
``Capacitor banks'' at the 11-KV line to increase voltage at 102
water pumps of Dhaka WASA.
	   Replying to another question from advocate Fazle Rabbi of JP,
the minister said highest 1,907.5 MW power was generated in the
country on May 5.
	   In response to a question from Fazlul Haq (Sunamganj-5), Noor
Uddin said the present system loss of PDB is 32.4 per cent, DESA
27.6 per cent and Rural Electrification Board (REB) about 17.2 per
cent.

	   PETALING JAYA, Tues. - The Selangor Consumers' Association will
file a suit against the State Government and Menteri Besar Datuk
Abu Hassan Omar for allegedly being negligent in managing water
resources.
	   The suit will be filed within the next two months.
	   Association legal adviser A. Jayaseelan said it would also file
another suit to claim compensation from Kuala Lumpur City Hall and
the police for withdrawing the permit to hold a forum at Bandar Tun
Razak Sports Complex at the eleventh hour. He said the permit
granted by the police on May 24 was revoked on June 2, a day before
the forum was supposed to be held.
	   ``We want to take legal action against the Selangor Government
for being negligent in managing water resources as the people are
being denied a steady supply of water,'' he said.
	   Among those who attended the Press conference were Federation of
Malaysian Consumer Associations secretary-general N. Marimuthu, DAP
secretary-general Lim Kit Siang, Pas MP for Kubang Kerian Mohamad
Sabu, Parti Rakyat Malaysia secretary-general Dr Sanusi Osman,
Malaysian Trades Union Congress secretary-general G. Rajasekaran
and several representatives of non-governmental organisations.
	   Twenty-nine political parties, NGOs, consumers' associations and
labour movements were represented at the Press conference held at
the MTUC headquarters.
	   Police had cited security reasons for withdrawing the permit for
the forum entitled Krisis Air Pada Masa Kini (Current Water
Crisis).
	   The Selangor Menteri Besar's office also requested Fomca to
cancel the public forum.
	   ``Although the provisions under the Water Enactment do not
favour us, we will file the suit for the destruction of catchment
areas,'' he said.
	   Jeyaseelan said the association would also be filing a suit to
seek compensation as it had spent up to RM4,000 to prepare for the
forum at Bandar Tun Razak Sports Complex.
	   Meanwhile, Marimuthu said the association was not even given
sufficient time to appeal against the cancellation of the permit.
	   He said under section 27 (7) of the Police Act 1967, it was
provided that any person aggrieved by the refusal of the police to
issue a licence may within 48 hours appeal in writing to the
Inspector-General of Police.
	   Marimuthu also criticised the police as the reply to the appeal
to hold the forum was only given to the association on June 8. In a
letter dated June 5, police secretary Kamaruddin Mat Desa said the
Cheras district police chief had revoked the permit following the
move by the management of the Bandar Tun Razak Sports Complex to
withdraw approval.
	   Kamaruddin, in the letter addressed to Marimuthu, said that if
the association was interested in holding the seminar elsewhere,
they could sumbit an application to the Cheras district police
chief.
	   Rajasekaran singled the New Straits Times as the main paper
which highlighted the water issue.
	   He said articles by NSTSB group editor Datuk A. Kadir Jasin and
the newspaper's editorial clearly stated the hardships faced by the
people due to the water crisis.
	   Later in a joint Press statement, the representatives voiced
their dissatisfaction with the recent police intervention to cancel
three events.
	   These were a gathering in support for Kota Melaka MP Lim Guan
Eng organised by the DAP on May 31 at the Federal Hotel, a meeting
among political parties in Malacca on June 2 and the public forum
on water the next day.
	   ``The Government's action in preventing these gatherings is not
only a violation of the basic human rights for the people wanting
to meet but also a violation of Article 10 of the Federal
Constitution which recognises the right of peaceful assembly,'' it
said.

	   The Sangu mine will start pumping 60 million cubic feet of gas
daily on completion of metre-connections within a couple of days.
	   Noor Uddin Khan said this on a supplementary question from ABM
Abul Kashem of Awami League.
	   The minister, who has lost his energy portfolio a few months
back, said the commissioning of Sangu gas field was scheduled for
April 22, but delayed for the metre-connection works.
	   Replying a started question from Shahidul Islam of BNP, Noor
Uddin said some 780 to 810 million cubic feet (mcft) gas is being
supplied daily from the country's 9 gas fields.
	   The breakdown: Titas 305 mcft, Habiganj 174 mcft, Narsingdi 20
mcft, Bakhrabad 93 mcft, Meghna 19 mcft, Salda River 17 mcft,
Sylhet 5 mcft, Kailashtila 93 mcft and Rashidpur 84 mcft.
	   The minister further told the House that 358 mcft or 44 per cent
of the total gas is consumed in power generation and 207 mcft or 26
per cent in fertiliser manufacturing.
	   The rest 245 mcft or 30 per cent is used in industrial,
commercial and domestic purposes.
	   On a separate question from Kazi Shah Mofazzal Hossain Koikobad,
Noor Uddin said the total reserve in Bakghrabad gas field is
estimated 867 billion cft.
	   Till last April, a total of 544.67 billion cft gas has been
extracted from the mine. Net pre-tax income from Bakhrabad was Tk
17.40 crore in 1996-97.

World Cup: Dutch arrive _ finally _ and hold first French training
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VERSAILLES, France (AP) _ Arriving in France a day after the
World Cup began, the Dutch headed immediately to their training
field Thursday to begin preparations for their Saturday match
against old rival Belgium.
	   Captain and central defender Frank de Boer is the most serious
injury worry for Dutch coach Guus Hiddink.
	   De Boer, who twisted his ankle in training Monday, went through
45 minutes of light fitness drills with physiotherapist Rob
Ouderland at the team's temporary training ground in this historic
town west of Paris.
	   ``For Frank, it is important he just starts with a little
warm-up and then maybe tomorrow he can go further,'' De Boer's twin
brother Ronald said.
	   Hiddink said he would wait as long as possible before deciding
whether De Boer will play against Belgium Saturday at the Stade de
France stadium in Saint-Denis.
	   The Dutch flew into Paris' Orly airport Thursday morning. Dennis
Bergkamp, who is uncomfortable flying, drove from the Netherlands
to the French capital _ a five-hour road trip.
	   Ronald de Boer said the team was pleased with the decision to
wait as long as possible before heading to France.
	   ``I think it is good preparation. It is better to take it easy.
If you are here for a week before, all you think about is the first
game ... this way everyone is relaxed.''
	   Bergkamp, who is recovering from a six-week-old hamstring
injury, trained with the Dutch squad Thursday and said he feels
recovered.
	   ``It is going very well at the moment,'' he said. ``This is one
of the few times I have trained with the group. I do not feel any
pain any more.''
	   But the good news for Belgium is that Bergkamp is not yet fit
enough to play 90 minutes.
	   ``I don't think I can play a full game yet. Maybe I could come
on in the second half. Belgium is probably too early for me.''
	   The Dutch team was met at its training ground by scores of
cheering children from local schools and some typically Dutch
weather _ rain and wind.
	   After warming up, the team went through a series of drills
including one to sharpen the players' one-touch passing skills
under pressure. Opposing teams are expected to try to strangle the
Netherlands' trademark fluent passing.
	   The Netherlands, World Cup runner-up in 1974 and 1978, has never
won the trophy. And although the Dutch twice beat first opponent
Belgium in qualifying for the finals, Bergkamp says the team is out
to avenge a painful loss to its oldest rival.
	   Belgium beat the Dutch 1-0 in the second first-round match of
the 1994 World Cup in Orlando's Citrus Bowl as goalkeeper Michel
Preud'homme parried shot after Dutch shot in one of the
tournament's standout performances.
	   ``We beat the Belgians twice in qualifying, but somehow we still
remember the one in America that we lost,'' Bergkamp said.

	   WHEN it comes to the Malay language, I have some good news and
some bad news.
	   The good news is that terrific new words are being added to its
corpus at a pace that makes keeping up seem like a hectic part-time
job. The past decade has seen the emergence of wacana (discourse),
wahana (medium of communication), madani (civil), mapan
(established), prasarana (infrastructure), nahdah (renaissance) and
dozens more.
	   These words were taken mainly from a choice of four foreign
languages: Arabic, Javanese, Sanskrit and our Finance Minister's
Budget speeches.
	   What they have in common is a refusal to do the easy thing of
kidnapping English terms and just spelling them in a Malay way -
you know, like diskus or sivil or infrastruktur. And as they
conform more readily to Malay orthography, they seem all the more
cun and gempaq and all that.
	   What's even more interesting about the words, taken
collectively, is their subtext. They all describe intellectual
abstractions; there's an almost palpable sense of the language
guardians seeking to demonstrate the ability of Malay to handle
higher things. You see, Malay has got a case to prove.
	   ``What case?'' I hear you ask. ``It's already the National
Language; its continued existence and preservation have been
written into the Constitution. So why has it got a chip on its
shoulder?''
	   Well, I never said it had a chip on its shoulder (try to be more
observant next time!). I merely said it wanted to prove something.
	   When the Government in 1993 allowed English to be used as a
medium of instruction for selected technical courses in local
universities, some people took this as an implicit sign that Malay
couldn't cope with the greater demands of tertiary education. Malay
just couldn't march fast enough to keep up with the newly
speeded-up national anthem.
	   As a reaction to this, there came a book called Manifesto Bahasa
in which linguists and intellectuals passionately came to the
defence of the language. The ijmak (consensus) was a sense that
Bahasa Melayu had been betrayed by the very people who were
supposed to champion it.
	   The fact that the book was edited by a member of the
anti-colonial Asas `50 literary movement provided a provocative
sense of historical continuity. It's as if the Government's
decision were analogous to something our colonial masters would
have done, and should be opposed accordingly.
	   After the ensuing wacana, the prevailing feeling was moderate:
we shouldn't be taksub (a new word which roughly means ``being so
proud of something that it makes you stupid'') about the status of
Malay as the national wahana. Temporary concessions need to be made
here and there.
	   But it was obvious that something concrete needed to be done,
lest Malay fall behind. It wasn't enough to just SAY what a modern
and versatile and flexible language it is, but to PROVE it.
	   Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka continued to do its part at its usual
pace, but we should duly acknowledge the Utusan Melayu group, under
the stewardship of Datuk Johan Jaafar, for being the
socio-linguistic equivalent of a sprinter on steroids.
	   From the stable of Utusan has come the uneven Massa, which is
supposed to be like Time. There came the schizophrenic Karya, which
puts sexy pop stars on the cover and commentaries by ancient
sasterawan inside. And there's also my favourite reading material
at the moment, the quite wonderful quarterly journal Pemikir,
published in association with ISIS and Foreign Affairs.
	   Some people privately snipe that Johan's articles show him to be
a shameless name-dropper. But as an amalgamation of litterateur,
intellectual, and entrepreneur, he has had an impact on the way
post- modern people write in Malay. (But some of his flagship
paper's recent stances - like its campaign to ``punish'' M. Nasir
and its support of the people who illegally raided the APCET II
conference - do seem kind of ...
	   well, I can't put my finger on it, but if I could, I'd have to
wash it.) Pasca-(post-) Johan, folks now try to be more
cosmopolitan with their concerns and references. Suddenly EVERYBODY
was quoting Samuel Huntington and John Naisbitt and Francis
Fukuyama, but I suppose we all have to start somewhere. At this
rate, no one will ever need to question the language's IQ.
	   So much for the good news. What about the bad news?
	   Well... think about the KLCC, the MSC and the KLIA. All have
English names. Since these projects are supposed to be seminal
mercu tanda (landmarks) on the road to progress, their names must
reflect a lack of official commitment to martabatkan (elevate) the
status of Malay.
	   But there's something even more worrying than this widely
lamented trend. If our language guardians are serious about making
Malay the lingua franca of the region, it's got to be worse news
that the Malay language is still, after all these years,
inextricably entwined with the Malay race, with its attendant
cultural and religious psyche.
	   The perception is that if you speak in Malay, your world-view
will usually be coloured in a certain way. A trawl through some
current events will be sufficient to demonstrate this.
	   Firstly, there's the Malay obsession with dengki and cemburu.
When an institution like The Observer cricitises us, the immediate
reaction from the Malay Press is that it's ``jealous'' of our
success. One expects this childish bit of demagoguery from some
politicians but not from serious editorials.
	   Then there's the lingering feudal hierarchy which treats as
taboo any sign of autonomy from people other than the immediate
ruler. This is the stifling atmosphere (what Rustam Sani calls an
``illiberal democracy'') in which our DPM has to constantly pledge
his loyalty to his boss, which of course doesn't do much to quell
all those rumours of Machiavellian intrigue. It's a pernicious
cycle.
	   Lastly, it's the convenient way in which socio-economic
phenomena are usually explained away not in socio-economic terms
but through conspiracies and broad generalisations which can
unfortunately take the form of blatant racism.
	   When I sat through a Finas forum last month on its imminent
privatisation (the Government had sold it to HVD, a Hong Kong-based
multinational), the concern was not in the way kapitalisme
kuncuisme (crony capitalism) or even privatisation itself tends to
run havoc over any ideals not immediately translated into
profit-making terms, but in how insulting it is to have to ``sembah
Cina''! (There were no non-Malays in the audience then.) In Volume
9 of Pemikir, the wondrous Rahman Embong has an article called
`Persoalan Sastera Nasional di Malaysia'. This is what he has to
say: (Sastera nasional) tidak seharusnya menggambarkan kehidupan
dan pengalaman satu kumpulan etnik sahaja, tetapi sebaliknya harus
merangkumi kebanyakan ataupun semua kelompok etnik di Malaysia.
Sekiranya sesuatu karya itu tentang satu kumpulan etnik sahaja,
maka pengarang harus sentiasa mengambil ingatan akan masyarakat
nasional yang lebih luas, harus mempunyai kesedaran tentang
kewujudan masyarakat tersebut yang perlu dibayangkan
sekurang-kurangnya secara simbolik.
	   Although I realise he's talking about literature and not
language per se, I'd like to take things one step further. My
ultimate test for how gah (glorious) the Malay language can be is
that it should be the wahana of not merely inter-ethnic harmony but
of chauvinism from different sides of the debate.
	   To be great, Malay must ultimately be a successful conduit for
non-Malay chauvinism (which I'm sure exists) and not just Malay
chauvinism (which I know exists).
	   I'm not of course advocating ethnic unrest, but I think that all
languages become gah when they're freed from the people who first
used them. That's the precise moment at which a language becomes
more neutral.
	   After all, Americans of the 18th century used English to be
anti- English. In literature, James Joyce arguably did the same
thing.
	   For as long as usage of the Malay language overwhelmingly
reflects the hang-ups and petty pieties of the Malay race, it'll
remain small no matter how many million people speak it. It must
grow to reflect the hang-ups and petty pieties that exist in ALL
races.
	   Khoo Boo Teik's book Paradoxes of Mahathirism contains an
epigram about our PM along the lines of: ``To secure the survival
of the Malay race, he was prepared to see the end of `Malayness'.''
	   I'd like to adapt that to the issue of language and race by
saying: ``To secure the continued development of the Malay
language, we should be prepared to sever it from `Malayness'.''

Interior Minister accuses mass-circulation daily of distortion

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Bild comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Interior Minister Manfred Kanther accused
the mass-circulation daily Bild Zeitung on Thursday of distortion
and fear-mongering for a front-page report on acts of rail sabotage
this year.
	   By citing ``secret files,'' the report suggests that officials
were withholding information pertinent to last week's deadly crash
of a high-speed InterCity Express train near Eschede in northern
Germany, Kanther said.
	   The tabloid is seeking to ``raise fears through the conscious
distortion of facts,'' Kanther said in a release.
	   Bild editor-in-chief Udo Roebel denied sensationalizing the
report, and said the paper only reported the facts.
	   Under the headline, ``Bild Uncovers Secret Files,'' the tabloid
cited an Interior Ministry document detailing 40 acts of sabotage
on Germany's rails this year.

Four people reported killed by cyanide spill in Kyrgyzstan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A sodium cyanide spill in the former Soviet
republic of Kyrgyzstan has killed four people, a news agency
reported Thursday.
	   Another 900 people have been hospitalized, Interfax said,
quoting the Kyrgyz parliamentary committee investigating the spill.
	   A truck carrying 20 tons of highly toxic sodium cyanide powder
veered off a mountain road May 20 and crashed into the Barskaan
River, which feeds into Lake Issyk Kul.
	   An estimated 1,700 kilograms (3,400 pounds) of sodium cyanide
leaked into the river and some of it reached the lake, which
includes a valuable nature preserve and is home to several rare
species.
	   The cyanide was being delivered to a gold mine operated by
Canada's Cameco company, the world's largest publicly traded
uranium company.

 &UR; Lull in fighting as world weighs military and political action
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yugoslav news agency confirming Milosevic visit
to Moscow, saying NATO meeting aims only to rattle sabers at

toward Kosovo from Albania.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Amid a lull in fighting in Serbia's
secessionist province of Kosovo, NATO weighed military options
Thursday while Britain's most senior diplomat urged both sides to
compromise and strongly suggested Kosovo should regain autonomy.
	   The Yugoslav state news agency condemned NATO's deliberation as
one-sided saber-rattling and confirmed that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic will visit Moscow next week as Russia tries to
end the crisis without NATO intervention.
	   No fighting was reported by either side Thursday, although
skirmishes between heavily armed Serbian police and soldiers and
the ethnic Albanian militants of the Kosovo Liberation Army have
become a daily occurrence.
	   More than 250 people have been killed since police began a
crackdown in March on militants in the province, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-1, and have been ruled repressively
since Serbia stripped Kosovo of broad autonomy in 1989.
	   NATO allies, increasingly worried that a lack of action will
send violence spiraling out of control in the southern Balkans, met
Thursday in Brussels and weighed an immediate show of firepower to
deter Milosevic from further military action in Kosovo.
	   ``If it requires military action or the use of some of the
military options to get him to see sense then that is after all
what we are here to do,'' British Defense Secretary George
Robertson told the British Broadcasting Corp. before the meeting.
	   Tanjug, the Yugoslav state news agency, said NATO should
pressure Kosovo's Albanian leaders to continue suspended talks with
the Serbian government, and ``take a serious look'' at Albania,
which it called the source of arms and training for the militants.
	   ``It is no secret that some of the instructors come from NATO
countries, and _ although they are individual mercenaries _
nevertheless are citizens of NATO member countries,'' Tanjug said,
alluding to ethnic Albanians coming from western Europe or the
United States to help in the fight for independence from Serbia.
	   Associated Press reporter Brian Murphy, in the border village of
Tropoja in Albania Thursday, saw a large convoy of mules loaded
with arms and other supplies, accompanied by some 100 armed
fighters, moving toward mountains and the border with Kosovo.
	   Russia, a traditional ally of fellow Orthodox Slavs in Serbia,
has invited Milosevic to visit Moscow next Monday and Tuesday,
Tanjug said without elaboration.
	   Tony Lloyd, No. 2 in Britain's Foreign Office, met Albanian
leaders in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, and afterwards urged both
secessionists and Serbian authorities to compromise.
	   ``There has to be a negotiating process...to stop the bloodshed.
We made it clear that we endorse negotiations for autonomy for the
people, the Albanians in Kosovo,'' Lloyd said.
	   He had met previously with top officials of Serbia-dominated
Yugoslav federation in Belgrade.
	   Lloyd blamed the government for most of the violence, but said
``our condemnation is equally about violence by the KLA in
Kosovo.''
	   Serbia vows never to allow secession of Kosovo, historically the
cultural heartland of the state.
	   Talks between the sides began last month under Western pressure,
but were suspended last week as the Albanians protested a Serbian
government offensive in western Kosovo.
	   Terse comments from Yugoslav officials after their meetings with
Lloyd indicated no change in the government stand, and the
Albanians seemed equally unbudging.
	   ``Our stand in any talks is the option for independent Kosovo,''
said Fehmi Agani, who met Lloyd in Pristina.
	   As on Wednesday, there were no fresh reports of fighting.
Milosevic _ and the KLA _ appeared to await international action is
taken over Kosovo.

	   The number of unemployed educated people is on a sharp rise that
might result in social and political unrest in the near future.
	   A study report, published by the Public Service Commission,
revealed this, saying the number of candidates for the
general-cadre posts has increased enormously in the recent past.
	   There were 27 candidates vying for each post in 1985 while the
number of job-seekers increased to 184 in 1996, said the report
placed in Parliament yesterday.
	   In the 17th BCS examinations held in 1995, the post applicant
ratio was much higher at 1:272.
	   According to the report the ratio was 1:71 in 1986, 1:126 in
1998, 1:85 in 1989 in 1990, 1:104 in 1991 and 1:179 in 1999.
	   The statistics showed that the candidates for the technical
cadres are also gradually increasing. There was only one candidate
per post in the cadre in 1985, while the post-candidate ratio
reached 1:9 in 1996.
	   The Commission said many problems have already arisen due to
increasing unemployment that ``will pose threats to political and
economical affairs in the near future,'' said the report.

Turkey suspends talks on all defense contracts with France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Turkey suspended all defense procurement
talks with French companies Thursday, stepping up the pressure over
an Armenian genocide resolution that has angered the Turks.
	   The resolution, recognizing the killings of Armenians in Turkey
early this century as genocide, awaits action by the French Senate
after unanimous approval in the National Assembly last month.
	   ``Tenders being negotiated with France have been halted until
the end of the (French legislative) process,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Necati Utkan said.
	   ``Our strong hope is for the motion not to be legalized,'' Utkan
said, adding that Turkey was being ``cautious'' about reports
stating that French Senate had not placed the motion on its agenda.
	   This could lead to a delay of several months due the Senate's
summer recess.
	   Turkey denies that the deaths of some 1.5 million Armenians
between 1915 and 1923 constituted genocide, insisting that losses
occurred on both sides as the result of a civil war.
	   Protests have been staged throughout the country since the vote.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Opposition groups and Nigeria's new
military regime appeared headed toward a confrontation as
authorities hinted Thursday that planned pro-democracy protests
would be stopped with force.
	   ``Such demonstrations are unnecessary at this point in time,''
said Lagos military administrator Col. Mohammed Marwa. ``This is a
time for prayers.''
	   The protests and a call for a nationwide strike planned for
Friday _ initially intended to mark the annulment of June 12, 1993
presidential elections _ have taken on added significance coming
just three days after Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar's rise to power as
the country's latest military ruler.
	   Refusing to grant demonstration permits and warning against the
protests, Marwa on Thursday told government opponents to ``avoid
any situation that would invite the use of force.''
	   Abubakar has angered Nigeria's opposition by offering only a
vague pledge to continue a transition to civilian rule that began
under Gen. Sani Abacha, the dictator who died of a heart attack
Monday.
	   Despite promising to turn the government over to civilians by
Oct. 1, Abubakar within days of assuming power appeared to be
consolidating power and eliminating potential rivals.
	   Two members of his inner circle were under house arrest in the
capital, Abuja, two independent sources told The Associated Press
earlier.
	   Opponents determined to push Abubakar and the army out of power
say they will challenge the new leader's mandate in court.
	   Gani Fawehinmi, a Lagos attorney and one of the country's
best-known opposition activists, said he would file a suit in the
Nigerian high court against Abubakar.
	   Fawehinmi said there was nothing in Nigerian law to say that a
chief of defense staff succeeds the head of state in Africa's most
populous nation.
	   ``Nigerians must intensify their struggle to end military
rule,'' Fawehinmi said.
	   The denunciations _ by an opposition tired of decades of
oppression _ followed a televised speech Tuesday by Abubakar, who
promised to proceed with a transition to civilian rule that Abacha
began. He gave no details on how that would happen.
	   ``The empty maiden address of Gen. Abubakar has confirmed that
there is no hope for Nigeria in Abacha's successor,'' said
Fawehinmi, speaking at a press conference on behalf of the umbrella
opposition group, the Joint Action Committee for Nigeria.
	   He said the group would go ahead with demonstrations in Lagos
planned for Friday, the fifth anniversary of annulled presidential
elections that were apparently going to be won by Moshood Abiola, a
billionaire businessman now in prison and accused of treason.
	   The group called on people to observe a nationwide 24-hour
strike Friday, staying away from their jobs and keeping off the
roads. It also urged them not to recognize Abubakar's government.
	   A combination of fear of violent repression by police and apathy
among a weary population has often limited the success of past
protest demonstrations. Police routinely fire their guns into
crowds of demonstrators in Nigeria.
	   Recent protests in Lagos and the university town of Ibadan have
resulted in the deaths of several protesters and dozens of arrests.
	   Sharp criticism of Abubakar comes from his apparent willingness
to simply pick up on Abacha's withered plan to hand over the
government to an elected civilian administration.
	   Abacha had blatantly manipulated the system to ensure he would
be the only candidate in Aug. 1 presidential elections. The
transition was to be completed by Oct. 1.
	   Government opponents said they had few expectations of change in
a country whose economy is crushed despite its vast oil reserves.
	   Little in Nigeria functions these days, from the water supply to
the telephones. The only people who manage to live easily are those
who can afford to buy generators, truck in their own water and hire
security guards to fend off the rampant crime.

Ethiopia says fighting breaks out on third front
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with eight grafs to ADD Eritrean comment, background &QL; 
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopian and Eritrean forces
clashed Thursday along a third front in the region of an important
Red Sea port, government spokesmen said.
	   Fighting also continued in northwestern Ethiopia at the
Badme-Shiraro military post inside the Yirga triangle region, the
400-square-kilometer (160-square-mile) area where the clash between
the neighboring countries broke out in early May, Ethiopian
spokeswoman Salome Tadesse said.
	   No fighting was reported around Zala Ambessa in the northeast.
The Eritreans captured the border town of 15,000 last week.
	   On Thursday, Eritrean and Ethiopian troops fought along a road
surrounded by sand dunes at the border southwest of the Eritrean
port of Assab.
	   As in the past, each side accused the other of provoking the
fight.
	   ``Ethiopia had been amassing troops in the area in preparation
for this attack,'' the Eritrean government said in a statemeent.
	   The Assab region is where landlocked Ethiopia's border comes
closest to the Red Sea, about 75 kilometers (45 miles) away. It is
the first time fighting has flared in this area. The port town is
critical for imports and exports for the Ethiopian capital Addis
Ababa, 650 kilometers (400 miles) to the southwest.
	   Until the current border dispute erupted into fighting, Ethiopia
exported most of its coffee _ its chief foreign-currency earner _
through Assab. It now uses the port of Djibouti to the south on the
Gulf of Aden.
	   The fighting comes amid growing international efforts to prevent
the clashes from escalating into a full-scale war.
	   On Wednesday, the Organization of African Unity said a
delegation of African leaders would visit Ethiopia and Eritrea on a
peace mission. No date was set for the mission.
	   Eritrea, meanwhile, proposed that Egypt join the United States
and Rwanda in attempts at mediation.
	   The United States and Rwanda have put forth a four-point
proposal to stop the fighting and start talks. Ethiopia accepted,
but Eritrea demurred, claiming the plan, which suggests that
Eritrea withdraw to positions it held before the fighting broke out
May 6, needed more work.
	   Regional military sources say the plan calls for Rwanda to
supply the peacekeeping forces to enforce demilitarization of
disputed border regions.
	   Eritrean rebels fought Ethiopia for 30 years to gain
independence. They succeeded in 1993, two years after helping
Ethiopian rebels under Meles Zenawi _ who is now prime minister _
oust a 17-year military dictatorship.
	   The 53-nation OAU said its delegation will try to persuade both
parties to agree to a cease-fire and peace talks. Eritrean Foreign
Minister Haile Woldetensae welcomed the proposal and said his
country was willing to withdraw immediately from disputed
territory. There was no comment from his Ethiopian counterpart.
	   In Cairo, Eritrean officials said they wanted Egypt and possibly
other African nations to mediate the conflict as well.
	   But Egypt and Ethiopia do not always agree on issues in the Horn
of Africa. Egypt has been backing one set of faction leaders in an
attempt to secure peace and set up a national administration in
war-ravaged Somalia; Ethiopia backs their rivals.
	   Italy colonized Eritrea in 1885 but was defeated in its attempt
to conquer Ethiopia as well. Britain assumed control of Eritrea in
1941 and the territory was absorbed into Ethiopia in 1962.

Sampras beats Black as rain eases
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated with other results &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Pete Sampras began his Wimbledon preparations
Thursday with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Zimbabwe's Wayne Black on
another wet and windy day at Queen's Club.
	   In his first match since losing in the second round of the
French Open, the top-seeded American played through drizzle, a
stiff breeze and bitter cold to win in 59 minutes.
	   Sampras wore cyling shorts beneath his regular shorts and
several times blew on his fingers to keep them warm. Black fell
twice on the slippery surface and twice appealed in vain for the
match to be halted.
	   Organizers, facing a huge backlog of matches after three days of
rain delays, pushed ahead with the program.
	   Sampras, who had a bye in the first round, was scheduled to play
his third-round match against Mark Woodforde later in the day.
	   Sampras, who has had a mediocre year so far, is using Queen's as
a tuneup for Wimbledon, a Grand Slam tournament he has won four
times. Wimbledon opens on June 22.
	   Moving cautiously, Sampras broke at love to lead 3-1, and a
forehand winner left him serving for the first set at 5-1. Black
broke for 5-2 when Sampras committed his only double-fault of the
match, but Sampras took the set on his fourth set point in the next
game.
	   In the second set, Sampras broke to lead 3-1, but some fine
returns helped Black break back for 3-2. A backhand into the net
from Black gave Sampras a 5-3 lead, and he closed out the match
with a service winner.
	   U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter, continuing a match suspended
from Wednesday, lost 4-6, 7-5, 6-4 to fellow Australian Scott
Draper. Draper also beat Michael Chang at the same stage last year.
	   The third-seeded Rafter failed to match Draper's excellent
serving, good returns and crisp volleys.
	   All the remaining seeds in early action progressed.
	   Britain's Tim Henman, seeded No. 7, beat Sargis Sargsian 6-3,
6-4; No. 10 Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia downed Peter Tramacchi of
Australia 6-4, 3-6, 6-1; Brett Steven of New Zealand, seeded No.
13, overwhelmed Arnaud Clement of France 6-2, 6-1 and No. 14 Byron
Black of Zimbabwe outlasted American Jan-Michael Gambill 5-7, 6-4,
6-4.

Tehran mayor challenges the judge to produce evidence of graft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The mayor of Tehran challenged a judge
Thursday to produce evidence of his alleged corruption, telling a
packed courtroom he had not pocketed any public money.
	   The judge accused Gholamhossein Karbaschi on Thursday of
embezzling money from the municipality to buy a building for a
now-defunct newspaper, for which he had worked.
	   ``If I am a thief, say it. If I have received bribes, say from
whom I received them. In the last session the charges were
cooperation in embezzlement, but now I'm accused of embezzling
money. Sir, if I am a thief, please tell me where I stole from, ''
Karbaschi said.
	   The judge, Hojatoleslam Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei, tried in
vain to silence Karbaschi.
	   ``If you don't want me to talk, give the order to send me to
prison where I was before,'' Karbaschi said.
	   The judge relented, and the popular mayor spoke for two hours to
the packed courtroom. Outside the courthouse, several hundred
people watched the proceedings on two television screens.
	   Karbaschi said he had spent 100 billion rials (dlrs 21 million)
on the construction of buildings and roadway overpasses in Tehran.
The expenditures had been approved by Iran's supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   ``Not even one rial of the money mentioned in my charges have
gone into my pocket. If the issue of embezzlement is not clarified
to the people, this will damage the Islamic republic,'' he said.
	   Karbaschi's trial is widely seen as an attempt by hard-line
elements in the ruling clergy to topple key officials allied with
moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. Karbaschi ran
Khatami's election campaign last year.
	   He was arrested April 4 on the orders of the hard-line chief
justice. But his supporters took to the streets and, after a clash
between pro-Karbaschi protesters and security forces, Khamenei
ordered his release on bail.
	   The court case has gripped the nation, generating hundreds of
newspaper stories for and against the popular mayor. Not all the
trial observers Thursday supported the mayor. As Karbaschi left the
courthouse, a dozen hard-liners yelled ``Death to Karbaschi.''
	   If convicted, Karbaschi faces up to 10 years in jail, a fine and
a ban from holding public office.
	   The trial was adjourned until Tuesday.

	   Actual inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Bangladesh
is expected to be around US $ 3 billion this year.
	   ``Bangladesh will see a huge foreign investment in 1998 calendar
year. We hope we'll get 3 billion dollar foreign investment during
the year,'' BOI Executive Chairman Farooq Sobhan said in the city
yesterday.
	   Projects worth $ 1.5 billion were put in place in 18 months up
to December 1997, he said while briefing newsmen on investment
seminars abroad, at a occasion sponsored by the Board of
Investment.
	   ``Bangladesh could be considered the favourite destination in
Asia for foreign investment,'' he added.
	   The new projects, which are in the process of being signed,
include a $ 240 million cement factory at Sunamganj with French
company La Farge and construction of private container terminals in
Dhaka and Chittagong at an estimated cost of $ 500 million.
	   The BOI Chief said agreement for the cement factory will be
signed next month and there will be seven more joint-venture cement
factories in the country.
	   ``Agreements for generation of 2000 MW power will be signed in
the next 12 months,'' he said.
	   He said investment seminars in Singapore, UK, USA, Canada and
Italy from March-June this year generated huge interest among both
foreign and non-resident Bangladeshi investors and resulted in many
investment offers in different sectors.
	   Farooq spoke of a 600 million US dollar project offer from a
giant Canadian engineering firm to construct a ``mono-railway''
link between Tongi and the city's business hub, Islampur.
	   Among some other concrete projects, there was an Italian
proposal for a 120 million dollar hotel project and a proposal for
setting up modern hospitals.
	   The BOI chairman stressed the need for further strengthening of
the Board so that it can perfectly respond to the foreign investors
growing interests in Bangladesh. ``BOI needs to be provided with
necessary logistic support,'' he said.
	   Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI) President R Maksud
Khan said Investment Corporation of Bangladesh (ICB) Hedayet Ahmed
and Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC)
Chairman Rezau1 Karim, who attended some of the seminars abroad,
also spoke on the occasion.
	   DCCI President Maksud Khan identified the delay in decision
making as the main hindrance to attracting investment in
Bangladesh. ``The government's decision making process must be
speedy and transparent.''
	   Besides, Khan said, the absence of infrastructure facilities and
congestion in ports discourage foreign investors.
	   He felt that BOI should be empowered to take decision on its own
to speed up the investment process.
	   BSCIC Chairman Rezaul Karjm, who attended two BOI seminars in
England in May, said these seminars made the foreign investors and
NRBs know about the scopes of cottage and small industries, which
engage 80 per cent of Bangladesh's total labour force.
	   BSCIC industrial estates, many of which still remained
unutilised, can be used for setting up new industries, he said.
	   ICB Chairman Hedayet Ahmed said seminars abroad helped reduce
the information gap between Bangiadesh's investment opportunities
and intended foreign investors.
	   Many business forums in Europe and USA can maintain liaison
between intending investors and Bangladesh, said Ahmed, who
attended two seminars in England and USA.

World Cup: Still that special feeling fifth time around
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ He has 125 national team games and it's his
fifth World Cup. Still, Lothar Matthaeus gets those butterflies in
his stomach.
	   ``But when the kickoff whistle goes, you are so concentrated on
the game that you forget everything else,'' Matthaeus said Thursday
after German practice in Nice.
	   Except that Matthaeus may not be on the field but on the bench
when the kickoff whistle goes off against the United States on
Monday in Paris, Germany's opening match.
	   For the 37-year-old veteran, le Mondial will be the pinnacle of
his storied career. The only other player to have ever competed in
five World Cups is Mexican goalkeeper Antonio Carbajal.
	   But Matthaeus' late recall to the national team does not mean he
will be in the starting 11. In fact, it is unlikely.
	   ``I am aware of my position, I have spoken with (coach) Berti
Vogts,'' Matthaeus said. ``I won't be happy if I don't play, but
I'll have to accept it.''
	   ``If I couldn't deal with such a situation, I wouldn't be here
in the first place,'' said Matthaeus, who has more caps than any
other German.
	   In 1982 in Spain, Matthaeus was a rookie who made two brief
appearances on the field as a substitute. In 1986 in Mexico, he
played his first World Cup final, losing to Diego Maradona's
Argentina.
	   In 1990 in Italy, Matthaeus lifted the cup as the captain when
Germany took revenge and prevailed over Maradona's Argentines.
	   Matthaeus exploded in his opening game against Yugoslavia _
which will meet Germany in Lens June 21 _ scoring two spectacular
goals. He had an outstanding tournament and was named Player of the
Year.
	   Four year later in the United States, Germany was knocked out in
the quarterfinals. Matthaeus was later to be blamed for poisoning
the atmosphere by building rival clans within the team.
	   In 1995, Matthaeus ruptured his Achilles' tendon in what many
believed was a career-ending injury. But with typical
determination, Matthaeus worked his way back and thought he was
good enough to be called into Germany's team for the 1996 European
Championship.
	   Vogts said no. He even said Matthaeus would never play again for
the national team as long as he is coach. Germany won the European
title, Juergen Klinsmann was the new captain.
	   In May, Vogts had to eat his words. Regular libero Matthias
Sammer was out after knee surgery. His replacement Olaf Thon, also
a late returner to the ``Mannschaft,'' was battling an ankle
injury. Vogts had no choice but to turn to Matthaeus and name him
in his 22-man World Cup squad.
	   And on May 24, Matthaeus played his first national team game
since Dec. 18, 1994, as Germany began its final World Cup countdown
with a 0-0 draw in Finland.
	   ``I had really written off the national team and I was surprised
by Vogts' call. But it didn't take me long to accept,'' Matthaeus
said.
	   Matthaeus, usually a publicity seeker, promised Vogts he would
keep a low profile and keep his mouth shut. He made peace, or at
least signed a truce, with Klinsmann.
	   The two had legendary feuds during common days in Bayern Munich
and Matthaeus had accused Klinsmann of asking Vogts to kick him off
the national team.
	   Matthaeus has publicly dismissed any claims to leadership. But
in practice, he's often seen leading the show, after taking a few
days to adjust.
	   ``He was a bit withdrawn in the start but now he is his usual
self,'' midfielder Andreas Moeller said. ``Lothar should stay the
way he is, he should not try to become a different person. We all
know him.''
	   Thon is fit again and is believed to be Vogts' first choice for
Libero.
	   ``It's a long World Cup. I may not play in game 1 or game 2, but
there will be more games. And I can also play in midfield, where I
began my career,'' Matthaeus said. ``But no player likes to change
positions.''
	   For the moment, however, Matthaeus' fifth World Cup could be a
throwback to his first in 1982 _ a lot of bench time.

	   THE Hang Seng index was knocked back to its lowest level in more
than three years as a slumping yen sent investors on a selling
spree yesterday.
	   Stock and currency markets throughout the region also received a
hammering over concerns about the yen and prospects of the yuan
eventually being devalued because of pressures from the yen.
	   A nervous local market also reacted sharply to comments by Chief
Executive Tung Chee-hwa that the Hong Kong dollar was under
pressure because of the falling yen.
	   The Hang Seng index closed 412.09 points, or 4.91 per cent, down
at 7,979.37, its lowest close since 10 March 1995.
	   The blue-chip index had earlier hit a low of 7,906.39, its
lowest intra-day level since 8 March 1995.
	   The steep plunge in local stocks extended to London as the Hang
Seng London Reference Index closed 58 points down to 7,921. In Wall
Street the Dow Jones was up 9 points to 9,059 in early trading.
	   Late last night, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
signalled that the central bank would not raise interest rates.
	   He cited an unusual amount of uncertainty because of the
continuing economic turmoil in Asia. But so far, he said, the
American economic expansion, now in its eighth year, has not been
threatened.
	   In late trading last night, the yen was quoted at 140.83 to the
US dollar, after the Japanese currency slipped to 141.55 during
early afternoon trading.
	   Currency analysts and brokers said the Hong Kong market was
spooked by Tuesday's comments by the governor of the People's Bank
of China (PBOC), Dai Xianglong, that the weak yen was having a
severe impact on Beijing's foreign trade. Mr Tung further added
fuel to the fire when he said yesterday that the Hong Kong dollar
was under pressure as a result of the weak yen.
	   He said pressure on the Hong Kong dollar could be seen in higher
interbank rates in the last few days.
	   He stressed that Hong Kong must stand by its fiscal policies or
face another speculative attack on the Hong Kong dollar peg, which
could force up the interbank rates.
	   ``Any deviation from our long-held philosophy of fiscal prudence
will give rise to a speculative attack against the Hong Kong
dollar, which may well result in another increase in our interest
rates,'' he warned.
	   Market watchers, however, suggested that even before Mr Tung's
comments, the three-month Hong Kong Interbank Overnight Rates
(Hibor) shot up more than 200 basis points in early morning trade.
	   The three-month Hibor rates shot up to 9.57 per cent from 9.05
per cent, while the one-month Hibor was up to 9.39 per cent from
8.83 per cent.
	   Meanwhile, stock markets from Jakarta to Bangkok took a hard
tumble on speculation that the yen would fall to a low of 150 to
the US dollar.

NATO not welcome among Albanians near the Yugoslav border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with new graf 9 and 10, large convoy of mules,
100 armed men moving towards border. &QL; 
 &UR; By BRIAN MURPHY &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PADESH BORDER POST, Albania (AP) _ A guard adjusted his
binoculars and peered down the steep valley at a convoy of Serbian
military vehicles on the other side of the border.
	   ``That's where NATO should send their soldiers,'' snapped
Albanian Pvt. Perparim Kulici. ``Why Albania? They should go where
there is violence.''
	   As NATO officials convene in Brussels to try and organize NATO
air exercises in Albania and Macedonia, at the doorstep of the
conflict in the Serbian province of Kosovo, Albanians and their kin
in Kosovo are not rolling out the welcome mat.
	   They believe that foreign troops in Albania would only benefit
the Serbs by strangling the ability of the ethnic Albanian
separatists to funnel weapons and supplies from Albania into
Kosovo.
	   But some military planners contend that the local hostility to
outside forces fails to consider that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic might otherwise bring his battle across the border,
striking at the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is leading the fight
for independence in the predominately ethnic Albanian province.
	   Without a show of military resolve by the West, Milosevic may
see an ``open door'' to eventually take the conflict into Albania,
the source of arms for the rebels, said a Western military official
in Tirana who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   ``Signals are showing that a new Bosnia is coming up,'' warned
Ilir Meta, Albanian State Secretary for European Integration.
	   The Albanian government has pushed hard for an outside military
presence in its lawless northeastern frontier region, fearing not
only Serb aggression, but also looking for help to prevent looting
by KLA supporters of Albanian armories and police stations.
	   In the border village of Tropoja Thursday, this reporter saw
about 100 armed fighters and dozens of mules loaded with weapons
and other KLA supplies moving toward the border with Kosovo.
	   The convoy moved out as the U.S. defense attache, Lt. Col. Bob
Applegate, was getting briefed by the Albanian army in Tropoja on a
one-day visit on which he refused comment.
	   Western leaders have promised not to repeat past mistakes in the
Balkans and seek to quell the conflict before it spins out of
control.
	   If NATO does deploy in Albania and neighboring Macedonia, it may
couple that with threats of air strikes against the Serbs if they
do not stop their assaults on Kosovo Albanians.
	   In northeast Albania and Kosovo itself, local voices questioning
a possible military mission are being drowned out by calls for
action by NATO allies.
	   Some rebel militia men have even threatened to lash back at
foreign troops if they interfere with the supply routes to
separatists in Kosovo.
	   ``Do we have a choice?'' asked Enver Caja, who says he is a KLA
leader organizing supply runs from the Albanian village Tropoja.
``We will have to shoot at NATO if they block us.''
	   ``Why don't the troops intervene directly in Kosovo? The West is
trying to look strong, but instead it looks weak by coming to
Albania and not Kosovo, where people are dying,'' complained Ajim
Kulipi in Tropoja, the first stop for many of the estimated 10,000
refugees who have fled Kosovo to Albania.
	   But the opposition to military intervention is not universal. A
Tropoja merchant, Ibrahim Selimi, said a NATO force at the border
could be an ``important show of power to the Serbs.''
	   Besides overcoming local resistance, any possible outside ground
force would face huge logistical hurdles. The terrain is a maze of
razor-edged peaks and plunging valleys. The 20-kilometer (12-mile)
road from the provincial center of Bajram Curri to Tropoja is
little more than a rutted path in some places.
	   Military engineers would need more than a month just to make an
adequate road, said William Foxton, an observer with the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is
advising Western leaders on the conditions in the border region.
	   ``And then you would have to build helicopter pads, fuel depots,
water facilities,'' he said. ``It would be an enormous and costly
task that I'm not sure NATO is ready to undertake.''

	   A move by the Security Exchange Commission (SEC) to file a case
against Advanced Chemical Industries Ltd (ACI) for its alleged
irregularities by postponing issuance of public shares, as
announced earlier, was foiled as the directors and executives of
the latter managed to obtain injunction from the court staying any
proceedings against ACI.
	   It is learnt that the Deputy Director of the SEC prepared a case
under Section 25 of the Securities and Exchange Ordinance 1969
against ACI and the management of the company, including M.
Anisuddowla, Chairman and Managing Director, and C K Haider, and
Syed Manzur Elahi, Directors of the company.
	   Following the injunction obtained by ACI against the move of the
SEC, the Metropolitan Magistrate also postponed hearing of another
case filed by the SEC against Consolidated Chemical Ltd (CCL) and
its directors till the disposal of the civil suit against the SEC.
	   The SEC in its move against ACI wanted to sue the company for
playing foul with public investments. The complaint was that the
ACI planned to raise Tk 396.9 million through right issue of 13,230
ordinary shares of Tk 10 each at a price of Tk 30, including a
premium of Tk 20 on the basis of nine shares for every existing
five shares. Accordingly, the ACI issued right offer documents on
December 17, 1997. It was announced that the issue would remain
open till January 10 but later the date was extended upto January
20.
	   Then all of a sudden, the company on January 19 at a meeting
decided to postpone the offer of rights issue of shares dated
December 17, 1997 and refund the amount already paid by the share
holders. This information was conveyed to the SEC, the DSE and the
CSE. The DSE suspended trading of ACI shares until the status of
the rights issue matter and the action of the company became clear
to the investors. Later an enquiry committee of the SEC detected
huge fraudulent trading within the meaning of Section 17 of the SEC
ordinance by the company, its chairman and managing director and
Consolidated Chemicals Ltd (CCL) and the Company Secretary.
	   When the SEC was contemplating legal action against ACI, the
company obtained an injunction against such a move.
	   The company pleaded that it had been subjected to blackmail by
the SEC which offered not to take any punitive action if the
company Chairman and Secretary tendered their resignations.
	   Bangladesh trade circles are surprised by the SEC's move as
being an official body it had no justification to make a
conditional offer to the company of suspending any action against
alleged financial irregularities.
	   All that the SEC was supposed to do was to do take action
against the erring company. By the SEC's action the company has got
an opportunity to delay criminal proceedings against it while the
real sufferers would be the investors.

	   BARS showing last night's World Cup coverage drew crowds of up
to 300 for the tournament's inaugural match between Scotland and
Brazil.
	   Dickens sports bar in Causeway Bay showed the game on five
television monitors plus two two-by-1.5 metre screens, and happy
hour lasted as long as the live match.
	   Delaney's in Wan Chai showed the match on its two metre screen,
and manager Malcolm Wan Ka-ming estimated a crowd of about 200.
``We were expecting a lot of people for Scotland and England games
as this is an Irish pub,'' he said.
	   The China Jump, where ousted England player Paul Gascoigne was
pictured in the notorious Dentist's Chair, had a separate viewing
room.
	   The LA Cafe had a two-by-two-metre screen and a large crowd,
with more than 60 table reservations for the evening.
	   Hundreds of fans gathered in the Hong Kong Stadium bar, enjoying
the carnival atmosphere. ``I come here because there's more
feeling. There are many people shouting. I don't feel alone in
supporting my team,'' said a Brazil supporter in his 20s.
	   But some fans complained the drinks sold were too expensive _ at
$50 a shot.
	   The ``Mexican wave'' went around as the opening ceremony
launched the event.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Hundreds of foreigners prepared to flee
the West African country of Guinea-Bissau on Thursday as government
forces prepared to crush a rebellion led by renegade soldiers,
officials said.
	   The estimated 700 evacuees, including Portuguese, French and
Americans, were to be taken from the capital Bissau by a Portuguese
merchant ship, a spokesman for the Portuguese defense ministry said
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bissau said there was
``significant fighting going on'' while the evacuation took place.
	   ``The rebels are shelling downtown districts and the
government's troops are shelling them,'' Bryan Hunt said in a
telephone interview with The Associated Press.

	   The country gets gas supplies from the Sangu gas field, the
first gas field in the Bay of Bengal, from today subject to good
weather at sea. Supply of gas from the Sangu field was to have
begun Tuesday but the gas platform could not be put into operation
due to bad weather. From day one the Sangu gasfield will supply 60
million cft gas to the Bakhrabad Gas System. The additional gas in
the Bakhrabad Gas System will be supplied to the KAFCO fertiliser
company.
	   The Cairn and Shell joint venture developed the Sangu gas
platform just 48 kms from the shore. The gas field was ready to
begin supplies to the Bakhrabad system on May 17, but a dispute
over the mode of measurement delayed the process. The Cairn tried
to begin supplies from yesterday, but it was not possible as the
operator of the platform could not reach the spot due to bad
weather. The platform is totally controlled by a centrally
regulated computer system from the shore. But the well of the
platform has to be opened by hand first to connect it with the
computer system.
	   According to a Petrobangla source, though Cairn was supposed to
develop a measurement system taking cubic feet as the unit it
developed the system on the basis of cubic metres. After long
negotiations the authority agreed to accept cubic metres as the
unit only for two months while the Cairn has given a commitment
that they would switch over to the cubic feet measurement within
the stipulated time. During the period the Petrobangla will not
make payment of one per cent of gas till the switching over of the
measurement system.
	   The payment will be adjusted later, the Petrobangla source said.
The price of gas was fixed at $2.40 per thousand cft, which is 70
per cent of the current Singapore market price.
	   The Cairn and Shell joint venture intended to supply 100 million
cft gas every day from today, but the Petrobangla was not ready to
take the quantity as the infrastructure to use gas was not ready.
	   The Petrobangla source, however, said that with the development
of one gas well at Habiganj, the country would receive 20mcft more
gas in the national gas grid. The 20 m cft gas being developed by
BAPEX will be supplied through North- South gas system. The source
said that the Habiganj gas would be made available by the middle of
July and as such there would be no necessity of additional gas so
early. The source however said that by next November the country
would require more gas.

	   CHIEF Executive Tung Chee-hwa yesterday gave broad hints of the
government's intention to adopt a new package of measures aimed at
preventing a further fall of property prices.
	   Responding to a question after a speech to a business seminar,
Mr Tung disclosed that the government was looking at other measures
apart from those that were recently announced by the government to
help the slumping property market recover.
	   ``There are a number of other things we are reviewing and I
would prefer to leave it just at that for the time being. Except to
say that we do not want to see the property prices really fall any
further and that whatever the government could do, should do, we
will do,'' he said.
	   Property analysts said Mr Tung's comments, coupled with those he
has made over the past few weeks on the property market, suggested
the government was making an all-out effort to restore confidence
in the weak property sector.
	   ``Mr Tung is clearly trying to be supportive of the property
market,'' said David Faulkner, a partner at property consultants
Brooke Hillier Parker.
	   He added that the government was being ``very cautious'' in its
comments, and that it would be some time before the effect of the
measures could be felt on the market.
	   Mr Faulkner said property developers would not announce new
projects following the new government measures.
	   ``It all depends on how the recently completed projects fare in
the market. There are buyers out there, but the developers want to
be sure that the market is on the rebound before launching new
projects,'' he added.
	   Mr Tung's latest comments came just a week after the government
announced measures to halt the sharp decline in property prices.
	   These include scrapping four anti-speculative measures announced
in early-1997 to curb the then spiralling property market prices.
	   Last month, Mr Tung met a group of high-powered property
developers, including Cheung Kong Holdings chairman Li Ka-shing,
and assured them that the government would initiate measures to
support property prices.
	   Market watchers then suggested that the government and
developers had come to some understanding.
	   Mr Tung also conceded that a supply glut of completed flats had
contributed to the worsening of the market.
	   Property stocks failed to respond to Mr Tung's comments
yesterday, with Cheung Kong sliding $2.80 to $34, Sun Hung Kai
Properties losing $1.90 to $30.30 and Sino Land down 15 cents to
$2.37.

	   President's Parade marking the Commissioning of the cadets of
the 38th BMA Long Course and the 17th BMA SSC special course was
held at the Bangladesh Military Academy (BMA) parade ground at
Bhatiary today.
	   Chief of Army Staff Lt General Muhammad Mustafizur Rahman
reviewed the smartly turned out parade and took salute at the
impressive march past.
	   Battalion Senior Under Officer Intekhab Haider Khan was adjudged
the best all-round cadet and awarded the coveted Sword of Honour,
according to an ISPR press release.
	   He also received the Chief of Army Staff's Gold Medal for the
best performance in the military subjects while Cadet Muhammad
Reazul Kabir the Osmani Gold Medal for the overall best academic
performance.
	   Meanwhile, the Hamid Company received the BMA Color for the
summer term on the basis of different inter-company competitions.
	   Addressing the newly commissioned officers, the Chief of Army
Staff said courage, discipline honesty, sincerity, loyalty and
above all patriotism were the main qualities of a military officer.
	   Hard training and regular exercise were the keys to success in
the life of a soldier, he said.
	   ``Boldness of personal character, professional excellence and
competence were essential for an able army officer in upholding the
image of the army, its honor and glorious tradition,'' Rahman said
asking them to reflect the professional experience in their life.
	   He expressed his optimism that the newly born officers would be
able to demonstrate their worth in their practical life through
sincerity, initiatives, hard labour and intelligence.
	   High civil and military officials, diplomats, parents and
relations of the cadets were also present on the occasion.
	   After the parade, the Chief of Army Staff visited the
commandant's office.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hundreds of angry Japanese soccer fans left for
France Thursday uncertain of whether they would obtain tickets they
had ordered for their national team's World Cup debut against
Argentina.
	   Of the 14,700 tickets ordered by travel agents for Japan's
opening match Sunday, only 2,200 had been delivered before the
beginning of the departure rush Thursday.
	   Several travel agencies have canceled their World Cup tours for
the Argentina match because they fear they won't receive the
tickets in time.
	   News broadcasts showed incensed fans at Tokyo's Narita
International Airport shouting at tour company representatives and
demanding an explanation for the missing tickets.
	   Many have been forced to give up their dream of cheering on the
Japanese side in person because of canceled tours. Among them: the
father of national team midfielder, Hiroshi Nanami.
	   ``I called my son to tell him that I will be there if his team
advances to the finals,'' Motoichi Nanami told a national
broadcaster NHK.
	   In Paris, World Cup spokesman Bruno Travade said he could not
explain what had caused the problem.
	   Worldwide, he said, 138,000 tickets had been distributed to 17
licensed agencies.

Lukashenko demands higher sausage output
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko gave
officials two weeks to fill grocery stores in the capital and
ordered a meat processing factory to boost production of cheap
sausages, a news agency said Thursday.
	   Lukashenko's orders were a response to a shortage of meat and
other staples in the Belarusian capital, Minsk.
	   Belarus has made fewer free-market reforms than probably any
other former Soviet republic, with most factories and businesses
remaining in state hands and the government setting prices.
	   The Belarusian currency has recently suffered another dramatic
slump, which, together with price controls, have contributed to the
shortages.
	   During a visit to a meat processing factory, Lukashenko said
that the increased demand for sausages is temporary and limited to
the capital.
	   ``There is no shortage of sausage in Belarus and there won't
be,'' Interfax quoted him as saying.
	   Later Thursday, the president was scheduled to visit a Minsk
dairy factory to order increased output of milk products, Interfax
said.

	   South Asian Youth Association for Regional Co-operation (SAYARC)
yesterday brought out a procession in the city protesting the
nuclear tests by India and Pakistan.
	   The processionists carried different banners and festoons
against nuclear testing. Starting from the National Museum, the
procession paraded the city streets and ended at the National Press
Club with a rally.
	   Convenor of the SAYARC Nirmal Rozario, Mostafizur Rahman Rumee,
Subal Sarker, Kamrul Hasan Al Quaderi and Nirapad Halder spoke at
the rally.
	   They emphasised the need for building up a South Asia free from
hunger and poverty instead of testing nuclear devices.

	   THE father of two boys whom plumber Lee Ying-kwong rescued from
a flooded nullah but apparently lost his life doing so thanked the
hero yesterday.
	   ``I would like to thank Mr Lee for risking his life to save my
sons,'' Sze Nan-ban said.
	   ``He is still missing,'' Mr Sze said as he tried to contain his
emotions.
	   Firemen searching the North Point waterfront failed to find the
body of Mr Lee yesterday.
	   A report of a floating body sighted off Quarry Bay waters was
made to Fire Services Department in the morning but this turned out
to be a false alarm.
	   The search was called off at noon.
	   At Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital, Mr Sze's oldest
son, Kin-man, 12, remained in critical condition.
	   His brother Kin-keung, nine, whom Mr Lee plucked from the water,
was in stable condition.
	   Kin-man had been submerged for 15 minutes as floodwaters pinned
him to the grating at the mouth of the culvert.
	   Mr Sze admitted his young sons were unsupervised at the time of
the accident, saying that both he and his wife had to work.
	   Mr Sze, who worked mostly in Shenzhen, brought his two sons to
Hong Kong from their mainland hometown in 1991.
	   The hero's wife, Yip Po-heung, said she did not blame anyone for
her husband's death but she hoped there would be an investigation.
	   ``It was raining so bad. The boys should not play in the
nullah,'' she said.
	   Although describing her husband as a hero, she said in
frustration: ``He should not have jumped into a flooded nullah. I
did not agree with his effort.'' Mrs Lee said she was still hoping
against hope of seeing her husband alive despite being prepared for
the worst. She burnt incense at the bank of the nullah yesterday
morning to soothe her husband's soul.
	   Kin-man's doctor, Yu Chek-man, said the boy had been without a
pulse for at least 15 minutes.
	   ``This affected the function of some crucial organs, such as the
brain and the kidneys,'' Dr Yu said.
	   The boy was breathing through an artificial respirator and was
in a coma.

	   Home Minister Rafiqul Islam called for concerted effort of the
countries of the world to combat drug menace and save the future
generation, according to a message received in the city yesterday.
	   He made the call Tuesday while addressing the 20th Special
Session of the General Assembly on the World Drug Problem at the UN
headquarters in New York.
	   Presidents, prime minister and senior ministers from more than
150 countries are taking part in the three-day session.
	   ``Bangladesh has totally banned the import, sale and consumption
of the cannabis,'' the Bangladesh minister said, outlining the
measures taken by Bangladesh government to stop the cultivation of
illicit crops.
	   Bangladesh government has enacted, he further said, the
Narcotics Control Act '90 with a maximum of death sentence for
possessing more than 25 grams of heroin or cocaine.
	   A strategy has also been formulated to reduce the demand for
drugs, Rafiqul Islam said, along with massive awareness-raising and
motivational activities.
	   He hopes the session would help adopt an action-oriented
programme in this direction.
	   The Minister Monday met the Bangladesh mission members to the UN
and exchanged ideas with them.
	   He asked them to try to build a positive image of Bangladesh in
the world and procure more foreign investment.

	   A CASINO in Hong Kong? Why not? The idea has come up in the form
of a suggestion to revive what used to be Hong Kong's biggest
foreign exchange earner _ the tourism industry.
	   But to skirt the Special Administrative Region's strict
anti-gambling laws, the Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong
proposes to make the casino exclusive to foreign tourists.
	   And it will be established on Lantau island, not too far from
the new airport and the giant Buddha, which is turning out to be
one of Hong Kong's top attractions.
	   Council chairman Simon Hau Shuk-ki said no concrete proposal had
been made to the government yet, but he believed the proposal would
not affect the security of the SAR.
	   He stressed that the casino would be open only to tourists
holding foreign passports and would not compete with Macau's
thriving casino business.
	   ``A lot of cities have casinos to attract tourists and Hong
Kong's night life which is less rich now will become more
attractive too with a casino.
	   ``I believe the police of Hong Kong have the ability to keep the
law and order of the casino,'' Mr Hau said.
	   However, Howard Young, tourism industry's representative in the
Legislative Council, did not agree that the casino could become a
major tourist attraction though it could help boost tourism.
	   ``Tourists travelling with their family might not want to go to
the casino,'' he said.
	   Mr Young said the idea of building a casino was acceptable as he
cited a similar example in Hungary where a casino was only
exclusive to tourists to comply with the country's anti-gambling
laws.
	   Meanwhile, in responding to the government's proposal to revive
the tourism industry, the council proposed to offer visa-free
preference to East European, Russian and South American tourists
and increase the number of direct flights from Hong Kong to these
countries.
	   They also suggested to set up an office of the China Travel
Service at the new airport to process applications of entry permits
from Taiwanese tourists wishing to visit the mainland via Hong
Kong.
	   They also called for the opening of a tourist market on the
mainland.

	   An international conference on Chittagong Hill Tracts will be
held in Dhaka June 20-21 to devise comprehensive development
measures for the region consequent on end of tribal insurgencies.
	   Besides representatives of donor agencies, some dignitaries are
likely to join the Dhaka meet that will consider what steps could
be taken for overall progress of the once-laggard but prospective
hill districts.
	   Invited to the conference are three very important international
notables - former US President Jimmy Carter, South African Nobel
Peace Laureate Bishop Desmond Tutu and mediator of Irish peace deal
ex-US Senator George Mitchell.
	   Finance Minister Shah AMS Kibria yesterday confirmed the
schedule for holding the international conference on CHT in Dhaka
on the 20th and 21st of this month.
	   The government has arranged the two-day high-profile conference,
being funded by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
	   UNDP's Need Assessment Mission has already conducted a survey in
the three hill districts and submitted its report, which will be
discussed in the broad-based conference.
	   The conference is taking place after enactment of bills
ratifying the CHT Peace Treaty signed between the government side
and tribal organisation Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity on
December 2, 1997.

World Cup: Spanish coach angered by training spies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHANTILLY, France _ Angered by photographers who attempted to
enter the Spanish training ground clandestinely, coach Javier
Clemente said Thursday he will forgo polishing up some play
strategies in case Nigeria got wind of them.
	   ``That spying stuff did me in,'' said Clemente, moments before
the side went into its last closed-door training session before
flying later from Paris to the western coastal town of Nantes for
Saturday's Group D game against Olympic champion Nigeria.
	   ``If someone like Bora saw what we were going to do, he'd
immediately work to cancel it,'' Clemente said, referring to Bora
Milutinovic, Nigeria's coach.
	   On Tuesday, French police caught four media photographers trying
to enter the Bourgognes Sport Complex as Clemente's squad carried
out its first team-only training, Spanish federation spokesman
Fernando Garrido said.
	   The team is to hold one more training session Friday in Nantes'
Beaujoire stadium before its World Cup opener Saturday at 1230 GMT.
	   Spying apart, Clemente was in an optimistic mood, saying the
team ``was full of enthusiasm because of the positive results of
the past four years.''
	   Under Clemente, Spain has been defeated just four times in 58
games since 1992.
	   The Basque coach has frequently been criticized for playing too
defensively and conservatively and not freshening up the side more
often with new talent.
	   The 48-year-old, chain-smoking coach had a dig for the critics:
``There are always detractors but I don't care about them one
bit.''
	   Typically, Clemente declined to give any hint of what lineup he
will use against Nigeria until an hour before kickoff, as is
obligatory. Earlier in the week when asked his opinion of Nigeria
he described the team as ``sensational.'' On its weaknesses, he
said he couldn't think of any.
	   Meanwhile, the Spanish players were kept away from the press
Thursday. Team officials said the feeling among them was one of
anxiety to get on the road.
	   ``So many days here, just can't wait to get started playing,''
Atletico de Madrid striker Kiko Narvaez on Wednesday. Spain arrived
at Chantilly, just north of Paris, a week ago.
	   The team's injury slate, brimming when it arrived, has been
wiped clean with Kiko, veteran keeper Andoni Zubizarreta, Real
Madrid's striker Raul Gonzalez and midfield kingpin Fernando Hierro
all declared fit for the match.
	   Spain's other Group D opponents, Bulgaria and Paraguay, face off
Friday in Montpellier.

	   Alarming increase in the number of unemployed educated youths
coupled with dearth of new opportunity for employment has created
an instability likely to pose a political and economic threat in
the near future.
	   This remark was made by the Bangladesh Public Service Commission
(PSC) in its 1997 annual report, distributed in the Jatiya Sangsad
yesterday. The remark was prepared after evaluating the scenario in
the Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) jobs over the last 10 years.
	   In its report, the PSC said that the job opportunities in the
public and private sectors was not growing in comparison with the
increase of educated youths in the country due to economic and
other reasons. The number of unemployed youths on the other hand
was increasing gradually against the limited posts, it commented.
This alarming increase of candidates against limited posts had
already created various problems in the society, the report
mentioned.

Executive found guilty of accepting millions of dollars in bribes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A former tobacco executive accused of taking
millions of dollars in bribes was found guilty Thursday, the
Independent Commission Against Corruption said.
	   Jerry Lui Kin-hong, 44, was found guilty of accepting 33 million
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 4.2 million) in cash and unsecured
loans between June 1988 and December 1993 when he was an executive
at Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corp. and British-American Tobacco
Co. (HK) Ltd., the commission said in a statement.
	   Lui will be sentenced on June 15.
	   Lui had conspired with Hung Wing-wah, Chui To-yan, Chong
Tsoi-jun, Chen Ying-jen and others to supply cigarettes from
British-American Tobacco to Wing Wah Co. and Giant Island Ltd. free
of government-imposed taxes, the commission added.
	   Lui was arrested in Boston in December 1995, but was extradited
to Hong Kong only last May.
	   He created a stir in Hong Kong when a Boston judge accepted his
argument that by the time he went on trial, the extradition treaty
between the United States and Britain would have lapsed.
	   Hong Kong was still a British colony at the time of Lui's
arrest, awaiting its switch to Chinese sovereignty last July 1.
	   A U.S. federal appeals court overturned the ruling last March,
and Lui was flown to Hong Kong in May.

	   CHIEF Executive Tung Chee-hwa has ruled out a deficit budget
despite continuous calls from the community for more government
expenditure and tax concessions to increase jobs and relieve
hardship during the economic crisis.
	   ``Any deviation from our long held philosophy of fiscal prudence
may well give rise to speculative attacks again on the Hong Kong
dollar, the result of which may well be another increase in our
interest rate.
	   ``This is not something we want,'' Mr Tung said at a conference
held yesterday afternoon.
	   Since the government had already granted the largest provisions
in Hong Kong history in the February Budget, he urged people to
give its measures time to work.
	   Talking about the legitimacy of his election by a 400-people
Selection Committee, Mr Tung emphasised he was chosen by the people
of Hong Kong in accordance with the constitution.
	   ``I will govern and run Hong Kong in accordance with our
constitution, the Basic Law. I do not feel any other way.
	   ``I am the chosen Chief Executive and this is a strongly
executive-led government, and I want to make sure it is going to be
kept that way.'' He reiterated the government would continue to
uphold freedom of the press. Concerning pressure on publications
hostile to the mainland, he stressed Hong Kong is a free market and
businessmen would make their own decisions.
	   ``They would decide for themselves what is good for them, what
is good for their bottom line, what is good for profit,'' he said.
	   The Chief Executive also yesterday addressed the importance of
working closely with the legislature.
	   Starting from next month, he will meet legislators and listen to
their opinion on social problems.
	   ``I want to emphasise the need for all of us to work together,
especially at these times when the economy is under pressure and we
need to work very well together to move forward.''

	   State Minister for Youth, Sports and Culture Obaidul Kader had
said the genetic problems of the Bangalees are hindering the
development of sports and games in the country. He stressed for
improving the health of the players through nutrition and exercise.
	   Obaidul Kader was speaking at a press conference held at the
Directorate of Sports and Youths in the city yesterday afternoon.
	   The press conference was organised to mark the grape cultivation
on the roof top of the buildings in the city. He said roof top
gardening would help alleviate poverty in the country.
	   Explaining the importance of roof top gardening, Obaidul Kader
said that the youth of the country are the driving force of all
activities and they could play a vital role in developing the
country through self employment and income generating activities.
	   The government would disburse a good amount of money among the
youths, irrespective of their party affiliation, for
self-employment. In the meantime, the government has set up 240
additional thana offices to promote development work through the
youths. At present 470 offices had been functioning covering all
thana, district and divisional headquarters, he said.
	   Besides, 69 computer training centres would be set up by next
August in all district and divisional headquarters to encourage
self-employment among the youths.

World Cup: Kanu takes part in practice for first time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RESSONS, France (AP) _ Nwankwo Kanu practiced with his Nigerian
teammates Thursday for the first time since the Olympic champions
arrived in France for the World Cup.
	   The lanky forward had skipped three days of squad workouts
because of an ankle injury, part of a series of lingering ailments
that have slowed Kanu's return to form since 1996 heart valve
surgery.
	   He had been working out separately in France, jogging and
stretching with a team trainer.
	   Kanu's participation at the morning training session in this
village 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Paris bodes well for his
availability for Nigeria's opening Group D match, Saturday against
Spain.
	   But another striker, Daniel Amokachi, did not take part
Thursday. Amokachi, like Kanu a member of the 1994 World Cup team
and the 1996 Olympic champions, twisted his right knee in practice
Tuesday and has been held out since.
	   Nigeria has been hit by a string of injuries.
	   Defender Jero Shakpore was ruled out of the World Cup with a
broken collarbone and replaced on the roster Wednesday by Mobi
Oparaku. In addition, first-choice 'keeper Ike Shorunmu and veteran
striker Emmanuel Amunike were kept off the team for health reasons.
	   If Kanu is fit, he adds an extra element to a potentially
dangerous Nigeria attack. The Inter Milan player provides the most
potent mix of power and creativity that coach Bora Milutinovic can
put on the field.

	   HONG KONG men who are too embarrassed to buy condoms in shops
and supermarkets will be targeted in a new television AIDS
advertisement.
	   AIDS workers say the commercial will also try to challenge a
Hong Kong myth that using condoms breeds distrust between men and
women.
	   Robin Wong Ling-ling, spokeswoman for the Committee on Education
and Publicity on AIDS, said the advert would try to counter these
attitudes by promoting safe sex through the use of condoms.
	   She said it was due out at the end of the year, and would
involve an actor _ possibly TV kung fu star Yuen Wah _ buying
groceries and condoms in a supermarket.
	   Ms Wong said the advert would aim to promote the idea that
buying the contraceptive was as natural as shopping for food.
	   ``We want men to get over the embarrassment of buying condoms in
shops. And we want to challenge the idea that some men have that if
they use condoms there is something wrong with their
relationship.''
	   She added: ``Some Hong Kong men believe their wives or
girlfriends only want them to use a condom if they think they have
been unfaithful.''
	   The advert will also demonstrate how to use a condom and explain
how it can prevent HIV infection.

World Cup: Sampson rips Vogts over ``respect''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo XLF104 &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France (AP) _ Four days before his team's
World Cup opener, U.S. coach Steve Sampson ripped into his German
counterpart for not respecting the Americans.
	   ``When Berti Vogts walks out 20 minutes before the end of the
Belgium match, that shows a lack of respect for the United States
team,'' Sampson said Thursday. ``In Europe, they have no respect
for the United States. Frankly, we haven't earned it.''
	   Sampson, who was referring to the Americans' 3-0 loss at
Brussels on Feb. 25, is openly using the respect issue to motivate
his players going into Monday's game in Paris.
	   ``When TV and radio commentators talk about how weak the
CONCACAF region is, that they don't expect the United States or
Mexico or Jamaica to advance, it's pretty clear they don't respect
us,'' he said.
	   Then he turned his attention on Italy coach Cesare Maldini.
	   ``Coach Maldini talks about how Jamaica makes the World Cup
while Italy has to struggle through qualifying, that's a lack of
respect,'' Sampson aid.
	   Sampson said the lack of respect filters down to the soccer
clubs U.S. players join, and how all the Americans who've play
abroad endure extra burdens.
	   ``When an American player comes to Europe, they have to do
something special to earn a starting job,'' Sampson said.
	   Sampson said February's 1-0 victory over Brazil in the CONCACAF
Gold Cup and the 3-0 win over Argentina in the 1995 South American
championship had earned U.S. soccer respect in Latin America. He's
told his players they must prove their talent to Europe during this
tournament.
	   ``A lot of people will be looking to the Germany match, our
ability to hold the ball against the Germans, our ability to play
an interesting, sophisticated style, our ability to close down
against the Germans,'' he said. ``We have a great opportunity to
prove how far we've progressed. The best way to do that is against
great opposition.''
	   A day earlier, midfielder Preki Radosavljevic said much the same
about Germany.
	   ``If I could sense any weakness, they may be overconfident,''
Radosavljevic said. ``That could be our chance.
	   ``They say in the papers they do, but deep down they don't
respect us at all. They think we have a long way to go. I think
they'll take us seriously, but I don't think they respect us.''

NATO not welcome among Albanians near the Yugoslav border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fighters moving toward Kosovo in 10th-11th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By BRIAN MURPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PADESH BORDER POST, Albania (AP) _ An Albanian guard adjusted
his binoculars and peered down the steep valley at a convoy of
Serbian military vehicles on the other side of the border.
	   ``That's where NATO should send their soldiers,'' Pvt. Perparim
Kulici said. ``Why Albania? They should go where there is
violence.''
	   As NATO officials convened in Brussels to try to organize NATO
air exercises in Albania and Macedonia, Albanians and their kin in
the separatist Serbian province of Kosovo were not rolling out the
welcome mat.
	   They believe that foreign troops in Albania would benefit the
Serbs by strangling the ability of the ethnic Albanian separatists
to funnel weapons and supplies from Albania into Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's
population, are demanding independence from Serbia, the dominant
republic of the two in the Yugoslav federation.
	   Some military planners contend that the local hostility to
outside forces fails to consider that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic might otherwise bring his battle across the border into
Albania.
	   Without a show of military resolve by the West, Milosevic may
see an ``open door'' to eventually take the conflict into Albania,
the source of arms for the rebels, said a Western military official
in Tirana who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   ``Signals are showing that a new Bosnia is coming up,'' warned
Ilir Meta, Albanian State Secretary for European Integration.
	   The Albanian government has pushed hard for an outside military
presence in its lawless northeastern frontier region, fearing not
only Serb aggression, but also looking for help to prevent Kosovo
Liberation Army supporters from looting Albanian armories and
police stations.
	   In the border village of Tropoja on Thursday, about 100 armed
fighters and dozens of mules loaded with weapons and other KLA
supplies were seen moving toward the border with Kosovo.
	   The convoy moved out as the U.S. defense attache, Lt. Col. Bob
Applegate, was getting briefed by the Albanian army in Tropoja on a
one-day visit on which he refused comment.

	   THE government should refund the additional costs universities
incur by increasing post-graduate courses as part of job-creation
initiatives, the University Grants Committee chairman says.
	   Dr Edgar Cheng Wai-kin yesterday said the committee has sent
letters to all six universities asking about their stance on the
Task Force on Employment's proposal to increase the number of
post-graduate places by up to 20 per cent. The committee is waiting
for their reply before discussing the issue with the government.
	   Although the committee supports the plan, he said he hoped the
government could reimburse the additional expenditure.
	   ``If they (the universities) have to fill up to 20 per cent, you
need to increase financial revenue to ensure quality because the
criteria for admission will not be changed,'' he said.
	   ``If the government is not able to reimburse the amount under
the present economic environment, we also hope they could recognise
the expenditure on it in the future.'' Formally facing the media
for the first time as committee chairman, the former Hong Kong
Stock Exchange chairman also outlined the committee's objectives
and directions.
	   He said higher education in Hong Kong has entered into a period
of consolidation after years of rapid expansion.
	   The committee will continue to improve the quality of teaching,
research and management, enhance the provision and use of
information technology, and make Hong Kong a regional centre of
higher education.
	   Dr Cheng said universities would need to produce graduates who
are creative and can adapt to the changing environment and who can
think independently to meet the needs of a highly competitive and
internationalised economic environment.
	   Realisation of these objectives would take time and the
committee and the universities are investing a lot on it.
	   He also said the committee has recommended to the Executive
Council that Lingnan College be allowed to self-accredit its
courses.
	   This will be a significant step towards upgrading the college to
be Hong Kong's seventh university.

After long march, striking Ukrainian miners reach Kiev
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Weary after a 500-kilometer (310-mile)
march, about 1,000 striking miners reached the Ukrainian capital
Thursday and surrounded the presidential headquarters and
parliament.
	   Banging their helmets on the pavement, the miners demanded their
long-overdue wages. One miner brought wrote on his helmet,
``Thieves, give us our money back.''
	   Police reinforcements were called to the scene, but remained out
of view in nearby courtyards.
	   ``The miners did not come to Kiev to take money away from
pensioners, students, invalids, teachers and medics,'' march
leaders said in a statement calling on Kiev residents to support
their plight.
	   ``We came to make the government return the money we have
legally earned, to defend our constitutional right to be paid for
our labor,'' said the appeal, cited by the Interfax news agency.
	   The protest march from coal-producing regions of eastern Ukraine
began in mid-May, accompanying scattered strikes that have idled
dozens of mines. Forty-five of Ukraine's 276 mines were striking
Thursday, union leaders said.
	   The miners are owed an average of eight months in back wages and
the overall wage debt stands at 2.2 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.1
billion), according to the Coal Industry Ministry.
	   The miners also want wage and pension increases and more funding
for the coal industry, plagued by numerous accidents caused by
aging equipment and neglect for safety rules. More than 170 miners
have died in accidents this year.
	   On Wednesday, yet another miner was killed in rock collapse at
the Kirov mine in the eastern city of Luhansk, emergency officials
said.
	   The cash-strapped government, which blames managers in the coal
industry for many of the problems, has sent some money to coal
regions and is supposed to come up with an additional 600 million
hryvna (dlrs 300 million) allocated by parliament to help the
struggling workers.
	   On the streets of Kiev, the miners were greeted with honks from
passing cars and shouts of support. Many Ukrainians, whose country
of more than 50 million people has experienced economic decline
since the Soviet collapse, sympathize with the miners.
	   Dozens of leftist and nationalist activists joined the miners in
rallies next to President Leonid Kuchma's headquarters and the
parliament building nearby.
	   The miners, however, say they have no political demands and
pledge to return to their homes as soon as back wages are paid.

Next week's Madeira Island Open added as British Open qualifier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) _ Officials of the British Open
decided Thursday to include next week's Madeira Island Open as one
of its qualifying events.
	   The event was originally excluded because of a weakened field
due to play next week in the U.S. Open in San Francisco. But
officials ruled the event was a full-fledged European Tour
touranament and should be included.
	   The British Open will be played July 16-19 at Royal Birkdale in
northwest England.

	   SHAH ALAM, Sat. - Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar, who
marked his first anniversary in office today, described the past
year as one of the most challenging he has ever faced.
	   He said although he had expected added responsibilities and
problems when he took over the post, some of them had caught him by
surprise.
	   ``I knew that being a Menteri Besar meant bigger
responsibilities compared to being a Federal Minister, but due to
the economic difficulties and the extended drought, the past one
year has been more difficult than I had imagined.
	   ``However, I am very grateful to those who have been very
supportive of me, especially the public servants, Barisan Nasional
leaders, the Federal Government, private sector, the media and the
Sultan of Selangor.
	   ``Without their support, it would have been much tougher for
me,'' he told reporters after opening a discourse on culture titled
Cultural Reformation Towards the New Millenium at the Shah Alam
Municipal Council banquet hall.
	   About 500 people attended the one-day programme which was
jointly organised by the State Umno liaison committee and the State
Ummo Youth and Wanita wings.
	   He said the economic and water problems needed to be tackled in
a rational manner.
	   He reiterated that both problems were not anyone's fault and
finger- pointing was not the way to solve them.

Chechen man executed for killing mother

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A man convicted of murdering his mother was
executed by firing squad Thursday in the breakaway province of
Chechnya, a Russian news agency reported.
	   Magomed Vakhabov, 34, who was sentenced by an Islamic court,
became the fifth convicted criminal to face a firing squad in
Chechnya since last summer, Interfax said. Chechen television
planned to broadcast the execution.
	   Russia has established a moratorium on executions while it
considers a mandate by the Council of Europe to ban capital
punishment altogether. While Russia considers Chechnya to be part
of its national federation, Chechnya considers itself independent
and carries out most functions of an independent state.

	   The budget session of Parliament began yesterday with Speaker
Humayun Rasheed Chowdhury announcing his decision to earmark half
an hour every day for unscheduled discussion.
	   The Speaker said that he took the decision in the in the light
of the experience he had recently gained from the House of Commons
to give the government and the opposition more time to speak on
unscheduled matters.
	   Chowdhury recently saw the House of Commons at work.
	   He said that the last 30 minutes of the session each day would
be devoted to unscheduled discussion. The first 15 minutes would be
given to opposition members who would be able to attract the
attention of the Speaker to initiate a discussion. Treasury members
designated by the Leader of the House or the by the ruling party
would speak in response for the next 15 minutes. The decision would
be effective from June 14, he said.
	   Humayun Rasheed Chowdhury said parliaments in different
countries of the world had this provision.
	   He said that the unscheduled discussion would be allowed after
finishing the day's business. The matter was discussed at the last
meeting of the Business Advisory Committee of Parliament, he said.
The Speaker sought the cooperation of all members irrespective of
party affiliations to make the activities of Parliament more
meaningful.
	   Meanwhile, the Speaker nominated a mandatory five-member panel
of chairmen for the budget session, to chair sittings in the
absence of the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker.
	   The panel members are Col (retd) Shawkat Ali, Khandakar
Asaduzzaman and Begum Dilara Harun of the Awami League, Dr. Abdul
Moin Khan of the BNP and Advocate NK Alam Chowdhury of the Jatiya
Party.
	   The House adopted a resolution condoling the death of 10 eminent
politicians who passed away between the eighth and the ninth
session of Parliament.
	   A minute's silence was observed as a mark of respect to the
departed souls, and prayer offered for their salvation. The prayer
was led by Moulana Hafez Ruhul Amin Madani.
	   The obituary reference was made to two former ministers,
Mohammad Sohrab Hossain and Abdur Rahman; former members of
Parliament (MPs) Moslehuddin Bhuiyan, Entaj Ali, Advocate A.K.M.
Khalequzzaman, Advocate Nurul Islam Khan, Moyen Uddin Sarkar, Mrs
Razia Banu and members of the erstwhile National Assembly Mohammad
Nurul Islam and M.A. Gafur.
	   After the question hour, a number of MPs read out their rejected
call attention notices. The session resumes at 3 P.M. today
(Thursday).

Russian arms trader: missiles to reach Cyprus later this summer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of Russia's state arms-trading company
said Friday that air defense missiles will be delivered to Cyprus
this summer as scheduled.
	   Yevgeny Ananyev, head of the Rosvooruzheniye arms-trading
monopoly, refused to comment on a Russian newspaper report that the
S-300 missiles had already reached the divided Mediterranean
island.
	   Ananyev said the missiles are scheduled to be shipped some time
between mid-July and mid-August, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Russian Air Force chief Gen. Anatoly Kornukov said Wednesday
that Cyprus is scheduled to test the missiles at a shooting range
near the city of Astrakhan in southern Russia.
	   Turkey has said it it prepared to use force to prevent the
missiles' deployment. Greece has said it will come to the aid of
Cyprus if it is attacked by Turkey, raising fears of a military
conflict between two NATO allies.
	   Turkey has maintained 30,000 troops on Cyprus since it invaded
the island in 1974, following a failed coup by supporters of union
with Greece.

	   THE rate of increase in the number of jobless workers relying on
government handouts has doubled in the past month, according to the
Social Welfare Department.
	   The rapid rise sparked a warning from an economist that this
showed more people had become pessimistic about finding new jobs
amid the economic downturn.
	   The SWD recorded 21,145 recipients of the Comprehensive Social
Security Assistance (CSSA) allowances for unemployed people last
month. This was an increase of 1,415, or 7.2 per cent from April.
	   Department figures showed 19,730 CSSA cases in April _ an
increase of 622 new cases, or 3.3 per cent _ from March, Director
of Social Welfare Andrew Leung Kin-pong said.
	   Last month Mr Leung announced that the rate of increase in CSSA
cases had slowed down despite the unemployment rate hitting a
14-year high of 3.9 per cent.
	   Yesterday he attributed the unsteady trend to the social
environment. He said Hong Kong people refused to ask for dole
unless they had been out of work for a long time.
	   Professor Leonard Chang Kwok-hon, head of the Hong Kong
University of Science and Technology's department of economics, had
a different view.
	   Prof Cheng said the drastic rise in May indicated a ``confidence
crisis'' in the job market _ meaning that people were getting
pessimistic about finding new jobs.
	   Prof Cheng added the recent government announcements about the
record high 3.9 per cent unemployment rate and the minus 2 per cent
GDP growth had a psychological impact on job hunters.
	   He also disagreed with Mr Leung's view that most Hong Kong
people were reluctant to accept dole.
	   ``Some people may find the CSSA gives more money than work.
	   ``It is only an ideal or even far from the reality to say that
morality can outweigh the financial consideration, especially as
Hong Kong is such an economic-orientated city,'' he said.

World Cup: Freund pulls leg muscle, will miss Germany's opener

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ German defensive midfielder Steffen Freund
is out for 10 days after pulling a muscle in his right calf, team
spokesman Wolfgang Niersbach said Thursday.
	   The injury means Freund will not be available for Germany's
opening match against the United States in Paris on Monday. He also
may not be available for the second match against Yugoslavia in
Lens on June 21.
	   Freund injured himself at the end of Germany's practice session
Wednesday afternoon.
	   ``He will miss at least 5 days of training,'' Niersbach said.
	   Freund will also need an extra five days to work himself into
shape, the spokesman said.
	   Freund, who plays Borussia Dortmund has been plagued by injuries
in his career. He suffered torn knee ligaments in Germany's
semifinal win over England at the 1996 European Championship and
was out of action for nearly 1 1/2 years.
	   He returned to the national team in April for an exhibition
match against Nigeria and called it ``the happiest day in my life''
after the birth of his child.

	   After leaving the mainland in November to live in the United
States, he arrived in Macau via Hong Kong last month without a US
re-entry permit.
	   Mr Bao said yesterday his three-week tourist visa in Macau would
expire later this week, and that he had ``nothing concrete'' on his
travel plans.
	   He denied reports that he had been denied entry by the SAR's
Immigration Department. ``I spent three days in Hong Kong on my way
to Macau last month,'' he said.
	   A source said Mr Bao was trying to obtain a US re-entry visa
through the US consulate in Hong Kong. ``He forgot to get a US
re-entry permit before travelling,'' the source said, adding there
were ``several other alternatives, such as extending his tourist
visa in Macau or travelling to somewhere else other than the United
States.'' Mr Bao has been offered assistance by Macau's tiny
pro-democracy movement headed by legislator Ng Kuok-cheung and
municipal councillor Au Kam-san.
	   A senior Macau government official who refused to be named said
the fact that Chinese dissidents could hold meetings and press
conferences in Macau ``without any problem'' was proof of the
enclave's ``political freedom and autonomy''.
	   The official said the issue of Mr Bao's tourist visa in Macau
would be handled ``according to the law, like any other visitor''.
	   Mr Bao said he arrived in Macau via Hong Kong last month,
travelling on a Chinese passport.

Lithuania to hopes top Russian visit will improve Baltic ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Lithuanians see a visit by Russia's
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov this weekend as a gesture of
friendship that could help smooth relations between all three
Baltic states and their giant neighbor.
	   ``We believe our good relations (with Russia) provide some
stability to the region, and can help the relationship of the other
Baltics with Russia,'' said Richardas Dejutis, a spokesman for
Lithuania's Foreign Ministry.
	   Primakov's one-day working visit to Lithuania, planned for
Saturday, comes at a time when relations between Russia and its
small neighbors Latvia and Estonia are strained over the treatment
of the large Russian majority of those countries.
	   Primakov has also expressed strong opposition to the three
former Soviet republics pushing to join the NATO military alliance.
However, the Baltic states all see membership as a way of
solidifying their ties to the West.
	   ``Lithuania is sticking to its goal of NATO membership,'' said
Arunas Godunavicius, an advisor to the Lithuanian parliament's
foreign relations committee.
	   Estonian and Latvia both have large ethnic Russian populations,
many sent to the countries during a half-century of Soviet rule.
	   In Latvia, about 700,000 of the 2.6 million population is
considered Russian, and Moscow in April threatened trade sanctions
against the country for what it considers unfair treatment of that
minority.
	   In Lithuania, the treatment of a roughly 10-percent Russian
minority has not been an issue, and is one reasons for its good
relations with Moscow.
	   Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus, who will meet Primakov, has
been trying to get Russia to ease up on Latvia.
	   ``President Adamkus has made it clear ... that he is against the
use of economic sanctions,'' the president's press secretary,
Violeta Gaizauskaite, said Thursday. ``He will say so to Mr.
Primakov.''

	   EMPLOYERS who cut employees' wages for not coming to work during
the black rainstorm on Tuesday will be prosecuted, labour
authorities said.
	   Worried employees yesterday called the Labour Department's two
hotlines with similar queries. The department received 42
enquiries, the Confederation of Trade Unions 94 and the Federation
of Trade Unions 140 on Tuesday and yesterday.
	   They were mostly about working arrangements and whether
employers could cut their wages under such circumstances. Deputy
Commissioner for Labour Alfred Chan Wing-kit yesterday said
employers who cut employees' wages for not reporting for duty
during the black rainstorm warning would be punished.
	   ``Employers have to be reasonable in considering the
situation,'' Mr Chan said. The government had issued guidelines to
employers to come to a consensus with their staff on working
arrangements when the black-rainstorm warning was issued.
	   He pointed out that it was up to the employee to decide whether
it was safe to go to work if no consensus was reached.
	   He told employees to report to the department if cuts were made.
	   A department spokesman said employers and employees should
negotiate the arrangements.
	   He said employees' safety in the workplace and their journey to
and from work should be considered.
	   ``Rainstorms or typhoons are natural calamities that cannot be
avoided,'' he said. ``Employers are advised to give due
consideration to employees who are absent from or late for work,''
he said. If employees had to report for work, the department
advised employers to reimburse extra travelling expenses.
	   Employees can call two hotlines _ 2852 3545 and 2852 3509 _ for
more information.

Toyota to recall 6 models with brake malfunctions: Report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Toyota Motor Corp. announced Thursday it will
recall six compact car models because of a defective braking
system, a news report said.
	   A total of 118,355 Toyota vehicles manufactured between May 1997
and April 1998 will be recalled, Kyodo News service reported.
	   Toyota's Corolla II, Tercel and Starlet were among the models
that face the recall, Kyodo said.
	   The defect involves a faulty pedal sensor which misreads
pressure applied to the brakes, the report said.
	   Toyota and Transport Ministry officials were not immediately
available for comment.

World Cup: Milutinovic crashing party with Nigeria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ELINCOURT-STE. MARGUERITE (AP) _ You can't throw a World Cup and
not invite Velibor Milutinovic. You wouldn't want to.
	   The man known as Bora has a knack for getting the most out of
his players and then moving on. Once again, he has brought his
signature brand of multilingual coaching and cajoling to soccer's
big party _ this time with Nigeria.
	   ``It's a work I like. It's different. It goes with my
personality,'' the Yugoslav said in an interview at the 16th
century chateau, north of Paris, housing his West African team.
	   ``People know me. People call me Bora. I like that.''
	   It seems like Milutinovic, who leads Nigeria in its Group D
opener against Spain Saturday, switches jobs as often as pop star
Madonna changes her look.
	   And he has made a career of proving prognosticators wrong.
	   He led Mexico to the World Cup quarterfinals in 1986, Costa Rica
to the second round just three months after being hired in 1990,
and the United States to the second round in 1994.
	   Nigeria hired Milutinovic in December after his second stint
with Mexico ended abruptly. It is his fourth different World Cup
country, a record he shares with Saudi Arabia coach Carlos Alberto
Parreira.
	   ``I am happy, because first of all, it means there's a job. But
first, second, third, fourth ... it doesn't mean a lot,''
Milutinovic said, resting his hands atop his shaggy hair.
	   ``I have coached 222 international games. That's what makes me
happy. That's my big pleasure. It means people like Bora's
personality and there are results.''
	   The coaching carousel has spun often for the 50-something
Milutinovic _ his precise age is unclear, since he lied about his
birth date years ago to extend his playing days.
	   The traveling has helped Milutinovic acquire a smattering of
English, Italian, Spanish and French to go along with his native
Serbo-Croatian.
	   All come spitting out in jumbled, staccato sentences, as from a
walking Tower of Babel.
	   In part because no one else could interpret for him, Milutinovic
has acted as his own translator for the media this week, giving
slightly different answers as he haphazardly moves from French to
Spanish to English.
	   He once started a news conference with the offering: ``If you
have any questions, I'll do my best not to answer them.''
	   At practice, the atmosphere is light. Milutinovic slaps
high-fives after good plays and laughs with his players after
egregiously bad ones.
	   One unconventional drill has players aim penalty shots at the
crossbar. Another has groups of five or six running backwards down
the field while keeping a ball in the air only with their heads.
	   There are serious moments, of course, when Milutinovic provides
instruction.
	   ``He brings a lot of experience,'' midfielder Sunday Oliseh
said. ``Bora makes us aware of what will happen on the field before
it happens.''
	   Unlike his earlier World Cup appearances, this one carries the
burden of high expectations.
	   Nigeria burst onto the international scene in its debut World
Cup four years ago, reaching the second round and throwing a scare
into eventual finalist Italy.
	   Then came the gold medal at the 1996 Olympics.
	   It has been rough lately for Bora's boys, who lost three
exhibitions in a row against Germany, Yugoslavia and the
Netherlands by a total tally of 9-1.
	   He attributes the poor showings to a lack of preparation.
	   ``If you give me the Nigerian players and U.S. organization I
would have a world champion,'' he said, dumping six sugar cubes
into a cup of coffee.
	   He is still bitter about his dismissal from Mexico in November,
shortly after the team clinched a World Cup spot, but his
have-suitcase-will-coach philosophy endures.
	   ``I had good results with Mexico, but some people, they thought
I didn't do well,'' he said. ``I was fortunate. I found another
job. I always do.''

	   HELP in the form of housing, food and child care were offered
but the widow of Tuesday's rainstorm hero only has one wish _ that
her mainland son be allowed into Hong Kong.
	   No promise has been made by the government to clear the way for
the elder son of Lee Ying-kwong _ the 51-year-old hero who
disappeared after trying to rescue two boys from a flooded nullah
on Tuesday _ to be in Hong Kong to take care of the family.
	   The wish expressed is that other than the return of Lee, the
next thing his widow wants is for her 19-year-old son, Kwok-hung,
to be allowed to come to Hong Kong and start to make a living for
the family.
	   Plumber Lee was the sole breadwinner for the family.
	   His wife, Yip Po-heung, said if her elder son could not come,
the family could only survive for another month on their savings.
	   ``I talked to him over the phone. He knows about the incident,''
she said. ``We at least need him to come to his father's funeral.''
Although Ms Yip's sister-in-law is now staying in their
400-square-foot Lek Yuen Estate home to help take care of
11-month-old son Kwok-fai, the family is in need of financial
assistance.
	   As an emergency measure, two officers from the Social Welfare
Department offered $4,000 in cash yesterday and promised to take
care of the family's housing, food, and childcare needs.
	   Housing Department staff also visited the family to see if they
could provide help.
	   A department spokesman said they would allow her to defer rent
payments under special provisions.
	   But a Security Bureau spokeswoman would not say whether the
government would liaise with mainland authorities to speed the
process of Kwok-hung's application.
	   Several politicians, including returning legislator Tsang
Kin-shing and Provisional Sha Tin District Board member Kan
Chung-nin, said they would urge mainland Public Security Bureau and
the Xinhua News Agency to allow Kwok-hung to come to Hong Kong.
	   Meanwhile compensation for Lee's family under labour laws needed
to be studied carefully, a spokeswoman for the Labour Department
said.
	   Employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or death
while on duty or on his way to work or back to home from the
office. The same applies when a worker is travelling between his
home and workplace when red or black rainstorm warnings or typhoon
No 8 signals are issued.
	   Asked about Lee's case, the spokeswoman said no conclusion could
be drawn yet.
	   She said this depended on how Lee lost his life.

	   ROME (AP) _ U.N. convoys have completed delivery of wheat flour
through the front lines of warring parties to thousands of
villagers in central Afghanistan.
	   They had been cut off from food sources by a year-long blockade
of the Hazarajat region, the Rome-based World Food Program said
Thursday.
	   The blockade was enforced by the Taliban religious army, which
had sought to keep food aid from reaching opposition groups. Part
of the aid went to the Ghorbund Valley, a Taliban-held enclave, as
part of the agreement by the Taliban that 1,000 tons of food aid
could be delivered.
	   The first two convoys crossed the frontlines May 28. Delivery
was completed last weekend with the arrival of two more convoys,
the WFP said.

	   THE Hong Kong Journalists Association will target President
Jiang Zemin's visit to Hong Kong in its campaign for the release of
mainland journalist Gao Yu.
	   It will publish a petition in an unspecified Chinese-language
newspaper on 30 June, the day the president arrives in Hong Kong.
	   Chairwoman Carol Lai Pui-yee said other journalists could face
she same fate as Ms Gao if the anti-subversion Article 23 of the
Basic Law is enforced.
	   The association is to step up its campaign against the laws, due
to be enacted in September, governing subversion and treason.
	   ``Gao Yu is a living example of what could happen here if
Article 23 is enacted,'' Ms Lai said.
	   She added there was already a lack of press freedom in Hong Kong
due to self-censorship by newspapers.
	   ``Some editors are using Article 23 as an excuse to reject some
news stories,'' she claimed.
	   She cited a documentary showing a Taiwanese protest during Mr
Jiang's visit to the US last year, which was aired in Hong Kong
minus the protesters' voices.
	   She added: ``Nine years on and newspapers are suddenly
recognising there was a massacre in 1989.'' Ms Lai was a
participant at yesterday's Asia Media Freedom Forum.
	   Overseas academics in the same panel session criticised the
``visual press release'' of the handover.
	   They said coverage was so controlled that there were no real
insights.
	   Alan Knight, of the Central Queensland University in Australia,
said: ``Press accreditation for the handover was by invitation
only, and some journalists were not even able to ask questions.
	   ``Some said they could just as easily cover it from South
America.'' Former Japanese correspondent Yoshiko Nakano, now a
researcher at City University, said she found four different
versions of Democratic Party leader Martin Lee Chu-ming's famous
balcony speech _ his Cantonese speech, his English translation, and
the Government Information Services' (GIS) versions of these two.
	   She said most media coverage of the handover was based on GIS
press releases on the Internet.

	   Drive to procure paddy and rice during the current Irri-Boro
season in the northern region of the country including Kurigram has
been facing a serious setback as less than five per cent of the
target has been achieved though one month has already passed. The
small and marginal farmers are allegedly not getting any benefit
from the drive as they failed to sell their produce at
comparatively fair prices due to numerous reasons. The middlemen,
'farias' and a section of dishonest businessmen in connivance with
some corrupt officials and employees of the Food department are
trying to reap the benefits of the procurement drive .
	   This year about 25 lakh metric tons of Irri-Boro paddy are
expected to be produced in the region. When contacted over
telephone , Divisional Controller of Food (DCF) , Rajshahi Mohaffz
Ali told this Correspondent that the farmers who were returning
from the government purchase centres frustrated were carrying the
commodities with more than 14 per cent (maximum allowable)
humidity. As a result, the local food officials were not buying the
foodgrains which might be rotten in the food godowns. The drive
started on May 7 and will continue till August 31. Upto June 6,
1998 only 8,878 metric tons of paddy and 5,780 metric tons of rice
have been collected in the 16 northern districts against their
respective procurement target of 1,72,000 metric tons and 82,000
metric tons.
	   The government has fixed purchase rates of paddy and rice this
time at Tk. 755 and Tk. 1200 per quintal respectively. An
investigation shows that in most of the 170 purchase centres in the
region, procurement has not been started due to various reasons
like demand of quotas for the local UP chairmen, members and other
influential persons. When asked the DCF said that it had become a
trend to violate the government rules at the grassroots level by a
section of dishonest people. In Kurigram, procurement started at
only three centres out of nine and only 317 metric tons of paddy
and 191.520 metric tons of rice have been purchased upto June 3
against the target of 8,000 metric tons and 3,000 metric tons
respectively. Similar feature prevails in other districts now. At
present, the small and marginal farmers in the region are selling
their newly harvested Irri paddy at rates between Tk. 190 and Tk.
220 which is less than the production cost.

World Cup: Spanish coach angered by training spies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING with AP logo &QL; 
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHANTILLY, France (AP) _ Angered by photographers who attempted
to enter the Spanish training ground clandestinely, coach Javier
Clemente said Thursday he will forgo polishing up some play
strategies in case Nigeria got wind of them.
	   ``That spying stuff did me in,'' said Clemente, moments before
the side went into its last closed-door training session before
flying later from Paris to the western coastal town of Nantes for
Saturday's Group D game against Olympic champion Nigeria.
	   ``If someone like Bora saw what we were going to do, he'd
immediately work to cancel it,'' Clemente said, referring to Bora
Milutinovic, Nigeria's coach.
	   On Tuesday, French police caught four media photographers trying
to enter the Bourgognes Sport Complex as Clemente's squad carried
out its first team-only training, Spanish federation spokesman
Fernando Garrido said.
	   The team is to hold one more training session Friday in Nantes'
Beaujoire stadium before its World Cup opener Saturday at 1230 GMT.
	   Spying apart, Clemente was in an optimistic mood, saying the
team ``was full of enthusiasm because of the positive results of
the past four years.''
	   Under Clemente, Spain has been defeated just four times in 58
games since 1992.
	   The Basque coach has frequently been criticized for playing too
defensively and conservatively and not freshening up the side more
often with new talent.
	   The 48-year-old, chain-smoking coach had a dig for the critics:
``There are always detractors but I don't care about them one
bit.''
	   Typically, Clemente declined to give any hint of what lineup he
will use against Nigeria until an hour before kickoff, as is
obligatory. Earlier in the week when asked his opinion of Nigeria
he described the team as ``sensational.'' On its weaknesses, he
said he couldn't think of any.
	   Meanwhile, the Spanish players were kept away from the press
Thursday. Team officials said the feeling among them was one of
anxiety to get on the road.
	   ``So many days here, just can't wait to get started playing,''
Atletico de Madrid striker Kiko Narvaez on Wednesday. Spain arrived
at Chantilly, just north of Paris, a week ago.
	   The team's injury slate, brimming when it arrived, has been
wiped clean with Kiko, veteran keeper Andoni Zubizarreta, Real
Madrid's striker Raul Gonzalez and midfield kingpin Fernando Hierro
all declared fit for the match.
	   Spain's other Group D opponents, Bulgaria and Paraguay, face off
Friday in Montpellier.

Israeli minister: Jew believed executed by Iranian government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has received information indicating that
a Jewish resident of Tehran was executed several days ago by the
Iranian government, a senior official said Thursday.
	   Deputy defense Minister Silvan Shalom's remarks in the Knesset,
Israel's parliament, followed unconfirmed Israeli media reports
that 60-year-old Ruhollah Kad-Kuhzadeh, an active member of
Tehran's Jewish community, was ordered executed for helping Jews
leave the Islamic state. The reports said he disappeared over a
month ago, and his family was informed by authorities last week of
his execution.
	   ``The government of Israel is demanding clarification on this
issue, and the Foreign Ministry has been asked to contact the Red
Cross, the United Nations and other international organizations in
a search for information on the fate of Mr. Kad-Kuhzadeh and that
of other Jews held in Iranian custody,'' Shalom said.
	   No official comment from Iran was available.
	   Shalom said the information Israel had received was ``partial
and unconfirmed.'' If the report is confirmed, he said, ``The
Israeli government would view with tremendous gravity the execution
of a person based on their religion.''
	   Some 25,000 Jews live in Iran, which has no relations with the
Jewish state. Israel fears that Iran is close to developing
missiles with capabilities of striking at Israel and has warned
Iran is advancing its nuclear program.

	   VERSAILLES, France (AP) _ Belgium beware. Dutch striker Dennis
Bergkamp is approaching match fitness and could play in the
Netherlands' World Cup opener Saturday against its low countries
rival.
	   ``It is going very well at the moment,'' Bergkamp said Thursday
after the first Dutch training session on French soil. ``This is
one of the few times I have trained with the group. I do not feel
any pain any more.''
	   Bergkamp injured his hamstring six weeks ago playing for English
Premiership champion Arsenal. He has not played since and his
training has been limited.
	   But on Thursday he went through a full _ though not very
strenuous _ training session with the Dutch squad and emerged
smiling and unharmed.
	   The consolation for Belgium is that Bergkamp, who has 33
international goals to his name in 57 internationals, doesn't yet
feel fit enough to play 90 minutes.
	   ``I don't think I can play a full game yet. Maybe I could come
on in the second half. Belgium is probably too early for me.''
	   He said he was confident of playing against South Korea, the
Netherlands' second Group E opponent, on June 20 in Marseille, but
would not rush things for the Belgium confrontation.
	   ``It is a whole tournament, not just one game. I have to build
up my strength.''
	   Dutch coach Guus Hiddink also was pleased with Bergkamp's
progress but agreed that Saturday could be too soon for a return.
	   ``He is not complaining about the injury, but we have to build
him up (physically),'' the coach said.

	   Q: MY father, who is 84, has diabetes. His feet and legs (up to
the knees) swell. Sometimes, his body itches. The doctors say his
kidneys are not functioning well but the medication they have given
does not seem to help.
	   He is still able to walk but is unsteady.
	   A: THE swelling in your father's legs is probably due to kidney
malfunction. He can improve the circulation to his kidneys with
herbs such as hawthorn and ginkgo. Astragalus may also improve the
function of his kidneys.
	   The itchiness is due to the kidney's failure to properly excrete
uric acid which subsequently builds up in the blood and causes
itchiness.
	   Rhubarb root may help against the kidney failure he is
experiencing due to the diabetes. He should avoid dandelion leaves
and other diuretic herbs rich in postassium as it is likely that he
is not properly excreting this mineral.
	   Antioxidants such as grape seed extract and the nutritional
antioxidants vitamins E and C can also be of great benefit.
	   There have been numerous clinical trials confirming the
effectiveness of grape seed extract (containing compounds known as
OPCs) in improving the strength of the capillaries and therefore
the symptoms of oedema.
	   In an open clinical trial, 78 patients with serious circulatory
problems in the legs received 150mg of OPCs from grape seed per
day.
	   Favourable results were obtained. The strength of the
capillaries normalised in over 30 per cent and improved in a
further 44 per cent of the patients.

	   Hazi Shariat Ullah Market, the biggest one in the town is in a
sorry plight. The market being situated at a low lying area in
comparison to the highway, people find it difficult to get into the
market from the road during the rainy season as the approach road
to the market becomes muddy and slippery just after a slight
rainfall.
	   The grocers and vegetables shops are so closely situated that
buyers face a lot of troubles to move from one shop to another.
They have to weave their way through the crowd. The most unhygienic
condition is prevailing in and around the butchers' shops. Cattle
and goats are indiscriminately slaughtered in the market and the
wastes of the slaughtered animals are thrown here and there
creating a nausea among the market-goers. Besides, these cause
health hazard.
	   The municipal authority is regardless about this state of
affairs which is contrary to the existing Pourashava rules. Similar
is the condition of fish market which always remains waterlogged
and muddy. It remains so congested that the buyers have to make
their way with great difficulties. There is no proper drainage
system in such a big market. So the plight of the people can better
be imagined than described.
	   The market constructed in the mid seventies has not had any
touch of reconstruction and renovation since then. The population
of the town has tripled since the construction of the market. The
market needs expansion as well as modernisation immediately.

	   REVENUE from this year's land sales are likely to fall short of
the $50 billion target, Secretary for Planning, Environment and
Lands Bowen Leung Bo-wing predicts.
	   But Mr Leung would not hazard a guess at how far the revenue
would fall short of expectation, saying it depended on economic
developments in the next nine months of this financial year.
	   After attending an opening ceremony of a sea-shell museum, Mr
Leung said there was an obvious gap between the time when the land
sales program was drafted for the current financial year and
today's actual market conditions.
	   According to the government's estimates last year, this
financial year (April 1998 to March 1999) would see land sales
revenue approaching $50 billion.
	   Mr Leung would not be drawn on whether the current land sales
program would be affected by the economic downturn.
	   But he said the government would closely monitor market factors,
such as banks' credit situation, public affordability and
prospective homeowners' desire to buy.
	   The government has announced a series of measures to stabilise
the property market, but Mr Leung said it was far too early to
comment on whether the measures had been effective, as they had
been in place for only a short time.
	   The government has not yet received any proposals by developers
on payment of land premium by instalments.
	   Meanwhile, tourism got a needed boost yesterday with the opening
of Hong Kong's first sea-shell museum.
	   The $5 million attraction, built in the shape of a semi-opened
shell, was opened for the first time yesterday.
	   About 5,000 shells from Hong Kong and other Southeast Asian
countries are on display at the Shell House, at the Lions Nature
Education Centre, in Sai Kung.
	   Mr Leung said the new venture would be of educational value to
thousands of tourists each year.
	   He added: ``The exhibition allows us to appreciate the
importance of shells to the living system that is the sea.
	   ``And most important, it helps us to understand that any damage
that we do to the marine ecosystem damages our own life support
system.''

	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ A top Russian official was headed on
Thursday to Namibia to seal a high-stakes partnership in diamond
mining, a local newspaper reported.
	   Sergei Yastrzhembsky, who heads Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's administration, is heading a 14-member delegation that is
to iron out details of an agreement signed in Moscow in March, the
Namibian reported Thursday.
	   Yeltsin and Namibian President Sam Nujoma signed the deal
calling for a Russian company _ Almazy Rossii-Sakha _ to help
Namibia prospect and mine diamonds.
	   The two countries might also consider joint efforts to cut and
market diamonds, possible competition to the South African cartel
De Beers that negotiates periodically with Namibia over mining
rights.
	   The Russian diamond giant is expected to form a joint venture
with local diamond players that would explore alluvial deposits
along the Orange River, develop offshore diamond fields and
prospect for other minerals.
	   Namibia is the world's fifth largest diamond producer,
accounting for about 8 percent of the world output. Mining is a
crucial foreign exchange earner for Namibia, which became
independent from South Africa in 1990.
	   -----
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A leading affirmative action campaigner
under investigation for massive fraud slipped out of the country
under an assumed name, the independent Financial Gazette reported
Thursday.
	   The business weekly said black tycoon Roger Boka left Tuesday on
the state airline bound for the United States via London.
	   The paper said security officers at Harare's airport were told
by superiors not to interfere with his departure.
	   Boka's private United Merchant Bank was shut down by the
government in April amid allegations it issued fake investment
bonds and was deeply indebted.
	   Boka, known for promoting black advancement and speaking out
against whites, allegedly allowed his bank to sell 1.6 billion
Zimbabwe dollars (U.S. dlrs 88 million) in fraudulent bonds
purporting to be on behalf of the state-owned beef producer, Cold
Storage Commission.
	   Boka's family and business associates refused to comment on his
whereabouts Thursday. Central bank officials said Boka should have
sought clearance from investigators before traveling outside
Zimbabwe.
	   ------
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ Maj. Pierre Buyoya took the oath of
office as president Thursday, nearly two years after he assumed
power in a military coup that he claims was necessary to stem
political and ethnic violence.
	   ``We have just solemnly sworn to preside over the destiny of our
people in strict accordance with the law and regulations of
Burundi,'' Buyoya said in a ceremony that was part of Burundi's
gradual return to constitutional rule.
	   Buyoya said his most important job would be to bolster bringing
peace to the tiny central African nation in which at least 200,000
people have died in politically motivated ethnic violence since
October 1993.
	   On Monday Buyoya will for the first time participate in peace
talks in neighboring Tanzania mediated by former President Julius
Nyerere.
	   On June 6, a transitional constitution took effect under which a
government of transition and an expanded national assembly of 121
seats will be established.
	   Five days after Buyoya's 1996 coup, Burundi's neighbors imposed
economic sanctions in order to force Buyoya to return to the
partial democracy he overthrew.
	   ``We've now returned to a more normal context,'' said Eugene
Nindorera, Minister of Institutional Reforms.
	   ------
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The U.N. World Food Program said Thursday
it is urgently seeking to expand its operation in southern Sudan to
provide more food to people suffering from war and drought.
	   WFP coordinator David Fletcher said the agency hopes to serve an
additional 1.2 million people in southern, central, and northern
Sudan.
	   WPF has been delivering food to 930,000 people in southern
Sudan.
	   Fletcher said WFP plans to raise its monthly food deliveries
from 6,500 to 9,600 tons, starting in July.
	   Fletcher said WFP lacks sufficient funds and food to reach all
in need in Sudan.
	   ``It simply won't be possible without a quick, massive injection
of food and cash,'' Fletcher said.
	   ------
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Police on Thursday posted a
reward of up to 500,000 rand (dlrs 100,000) for help in finding
people who allegedly staged four pipe bomb attacks.
	   Two of the four explosions that occurred Wednesday are believed
to have been set off by remote control, said police spokesman
Superintendent Wicus Holtzhausen.
	   The bombings injured three people and damaged two shops and
several cars in a poor district near Cape Town.
	   Officials mobilized more police reinforcements and set up a
special operations room in the Cape Flats area, the scene of
ongoing violence in past years between gangs and an anti-crime
vigilante group People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (PAGAD)
	   ----
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ Opposition candidates in Togo's presidential
election campaign, traditionally denied access to state media, are
getting air time after pressure from a journalists' rights group.
	   President Gnassigbe Eyadema had virtually dominated all news of
the campaign heading into June 21 first-round balloting, but agreed
to open up state radio and TV to opposition candidates after
objections from Reporters Without Borders.
	   The Paris-based group wrote to Eyadema earlier this month,
expressing concerns that his strong grip on Togo's media was unfair
to the candidates of four opposition parties.
	   Robert Menard, the secretary general of Reporters Without
Borders, said the Togolese president was ``playing the role of the
lion, with more than 90 percent of air time on state media
consecrated to his election campaign.''
	   Though opposition candidates are now getting some air time, it
is nowhere near equal to Eyadema's, the group noted.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbs and ethnic Albanians took a
break in fighting Thursday as NATO decided to mount air exercises
in a show of force intended to stop the violence in the separatist
province of Kosovo.
	   The Yugoslav state news agency had earlier condemned NATO's
deliberation over the exercises as one-sided saber-rattling. The
agency also confirmed that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
will visit Moscow next week as Russia, a traditional ally of fellow
Orthodox Slavs in Serbia, tries to end the crisis without NATO
intervention.
	   No fighting was reported by either side Thursday, although
skirmishes between heavily armed Serbian police and soldiers and
the ethnic Albanian militants of the Kosovo Liberation Army have
become a daily occurrence.
	   More than 250 people have been killed since police began a
crackdown in March on militants in the province, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-1 and have been ruled repressively
since Serbia stripped Kosovo of broad autonomy in 1989.
	   NATO allies, increasingly worried that a lack of action will
send violence spiraling out of control in the southern Balkans, met
Thursday in Brussels and agreed to conduct simulated air raids and
bombing runs over neighboring Albania and Macedonia to deter
Milosevic from further military action in Kosovo.
	   Tanjug, the Yugoslav state news agency, said NATO should
pressure Kosovo's Albanian leaders to continue suspended talks with
the Serbian government, and ``take a serious look'' at Albania,
which it called the source of arms and training for the militants.
	   ``It is no secret that some of the instructors come from NATO
countries, and _ although they are individual mercenaries _
nevertheless are citizens of NATO member countries,'' Tanjug said,
alluding to ethnic Albanians coming from western Europe or the
United States to help in Kosovo's fight for independence from
Serbia.
	   In the border village of Tropoja in Albania on Thursday, a large
convoy of mules loaded with arms and other supplies, accompanied by
some 100 armed fighters, was seen moving toward the border with
Kosovo.

Official reports first Ukrainian GDP growth since 1989
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian recorded its first increase in
gross domestic product growth since 1989, a news agency reported
Thursday.
	   Presidential aide Anatoly Halchinsky said GDP grew by 1 percent
in the first five months of 1998, the first increase since 1989,
Interfax reported.
	   He cited figures provided by the State Statistics Committee.
	   Earlier figures have indicated a drop in GDP of 0.2 percent in
the first quarter of 1998 from the same period last year.
	   The Ukrainian economy has contracted every year since the former
Soviet republic gained independence in 1991, and it was not clear
whether the positive trend reported by Halchinsky would hold.
	   Government officials have forecast a GDP growth of at least 0.5
percent this year, but independent economists have expressed
doubts. GDP dropped by 3.2 percent last year and by 10.1 percent in
1996.

	   Some forest areas, including Cox's Bazar sea beach forests have
been occupied illegally by some influential people for building
houses and cultivating shrimp. According to information available
here, some influential persons aided by the local musclemen have
grabbed hundreds of acres of land of the reserve forests and built
houses after cutting trees.
	   Sources said, some shrimp culturists have encroached the sea
beach forests created for attracting the tourists and started
culturing shrimps. The value of losses caused by the depletion of
trees has been estimated at Tk 30 crore. Meanwhile, thousands of
floating people including Rohingya refugees have taken shelter at
the forest areas including the sea beach.
	   The distirct administration in an operation evicted the illegal
occupants in 1995, but after a few months they built houses at the
sea beach forests after cutting trees. The law and order situation
and environment of the area are facing threats , it is learnt .

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Central League's front-running Yomiuri Giants
rapped out 16 hits, including a three-run home run by Mariano
Duncan, and trounced the Hanshin Tigers 14-1 at Koshien Stadium
Thursday.
	   Duncan, formerly with the Toronto Blue Jays, has eight homers.
	   The Giants are now one game ahead of the second-place Chunichi
Dragons who beat the Hiroshima Toyo Carp 7-5 in 10 innings at
Kurashiki.
	   The Dragons extended their winning streak to three and the Carp
suffered their fourth straight defeat.
	   The Dragons' Takeshi Yamasaki smashed a two-run home run in the
top of the 10th inning and Sun Dong-yol gave up no hits in the 10th
inning to notch his 12th save of the season.
	   Yamasaki has eight homers. Sun Dong-yol joined the Dragons in
1996 from the Hai Tai Tigers of South Korea's professional Baseball
League.
	   At Tokyo's Jingu Stadium, Takuro Ishii doubled home three runs
in the first inning and Robert Rose belted a three-run home run in
the eighth as the Yokohama BayStars beat the Yakult Swallows 7-2.
	   Rose, formerly with the California Angels, has three homers.
	   In the Pacific League, Phil Clark hit a tying one-run single in
the eighth and Naoyuki Oomura singled home the winning run in the
ninth as the Kintetsu Buffaloes edged the Chiba Lotte Marines 2-1
at Chiba.

	   ACTRESS Gong Li was hailed the ``Chinese Empress of the Screen''
by French Consul-General Thierry Dana last night before he invested
her with the award of Officier des Arts et des Lettres on behalf of
the French Government.
	   ``Gong Li is in France and elsewhere recognised as a star of
international standards who is known and acclaimed worldwide,'' he
said during a reception at the China Club.
	   Mr Dana said that cinema is of special importance to the French
who look upon it as a major art form as well as the best ambassador
of a country's cultural identity.
	   Gong Li was therefore one of the finest ambassadors of Chinese
culture, Mr Dana said.
	   As the most acclaimed Asian actress in the world, he said, she
had been chosen to sit on the jury of the Cannes International Film
Festival, the first time an Asian actress had ever been a jury
member of that prestigious event.
	   The star of Farewell My Concubine and Raise the Red Lantern,
also appeared on stage at the awards ceremony with American actress
Andie McDowell to present an award.
	   As he pinned the medal on the actress, Mr Dana said: ``This is
on behalf of the French people for whom you represent a symbol of
the Chinese culture of today and eternal standards of Asian
beauty.''
	   Gong Li replied, in Putonghua, that she considered the award a
great honour and thanked the French government.
	   Members of the cinema elite and the Chinese and French
communities, including mainland officials, attended the reception.

World Cup: Chilavert and Stoichkov set to clash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JUAN ZAMORANO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Hristo Stoichkov has seen it all as a
big-name player with Barcelona and World Cup star for Bulgaria. Now
he's about to meet a goalkeeper who scores from penalties and free
kicks.
	   Paraguay and Bulgaria square off Friday and that brings veteran
striker Stoichkov up against the extrovert Jose Luis Chilavert.
	   The Paraguayan 'keeper has scored 40 times from set pieces for
club and country and could become the first goalkeeper to score
during regular play in a World Cup finals game.
	   For Chilavert, however, scoring on one of his trademark free
kicks or penalty shots is less important that beating Bulgaria, its
first opponent in tough Group D. Favorite Spain and Nigeria, gold
medalist at the 1996 Olympics, play Saturday in Nantes.
	   ``Our main objective is to beat Bulgaria. That way we can settle
down,'' said Chilavert, whose team lost four straight in the run-up
to the Cup including a 5-1 defeat by the Netherlands.
	   For the Bulgarians, led by the 32-year-old Stoichkov, the
scoring co-leader in the 1994 World Cup, expectations are high. The
team is trying to balance youth and experience, hoping it can
repeat its success of four years ago, when it made it to the
semifinals before losing to Italy.
	   ``We are working well together as a team. The young players are
getting along well with the veterans,'' Stoichkov said. ``As for
me, I know where to go to score a goal. I am confident and I'm
hoping to make this World Cup as good as the one in 1994.''
	   Stoichkov, who plays for CSKA of Sofia but reportedly is on his
way to the Japanese league with Kashiway Reysol next season, shared
scoring honors with Russia's Oleg Salenko, with six tallies.
	   Paraguay, which has never made it past the second round in four
World Cups, is counting on the outspoken Chilavert, also 32, to set
the tone for its young squad.
	   He's counting heavily on a strong defensive line that includes
Carlos Gamarra, Celso Ayala, Francisco Arce and Francisco Rivarola,
all of them starters for top Brazilian or Argentine clubs.
	   Bulgaria has taken notice of the Paraguayan threat and is not
taking anything for granted.
	   ``It's a good South American side that has a solid midfield. The
defenders attack a lot but then fall back quickly,'' said Bulgarian
head coach Hristo Bonev.
	   Paraguay has been soft on offense, however, and Brazilian head
coach Paulo Cesar Carpeggiani has used five different forwards in
recent games and practices.
	   ``We're a young team. We want to make a good impression in the
World Cup, we want to shine,'' says forward Jose Cardozo, who will
lead the attack along with Cesar Ramirez.

	   Officers and employees of two Palli Bidyut samities under the
Rural Electrification Board (REB) and Natore Electric Supply Office
under the Power Development Board (PDB) have been passing their
days in sheer panic following the attacks of the agitated power
consumers due to erratic power supply. Three incidents of attacks
occurred during the first week of June in the district. An attack
was made on Natore Palli Bidyut Samity-2 (Bonpara) on June 3 last
leaving at least 20 employees including four security personnel
injured. A group of unruly power consumers equipped with lethal
weapons launched the attack.
	   The attackers damaged the safety gate of the samity, wireless
cell, Ansar Box, furniture and glass of the main building of the
samity. Four security men (Armed Ansars) were hurt during the
attack. The injured were admitted to Baraigram thana health
complex. Sources in the Natore Palli Biddyut Samity-2 said, the
daily demand of power for 42,000 consumers including North Bengal
Sugar Mills (Gopalpur), Sardah Police Academy, Rajshahi Cadet
College and about 1,000 power driven irrigation machines is 9
megawatts , but the supply is only 1 to 1.5 megawatt . That is why
the samity is forced to suspend power supply, sources said. Another
incident of attack was reported on June 5 on Natore Electric Supply
Office.
	   A group of unruly youths gherowed the office and damaged the
gloves, furniture's of the office building and threatened the
employees for abnormal loadsheding and frequent power disruption.
The supply situation was almost same in the office. The last
incident of attack was reported on Natore Palli Bidyut Samity-1
(Natore Sadar) on June 6. A group of villagers equiped with sharp
and lethal weapon tried to attack on it's Puthia sub-station office
and Natore main office on the same day protesting continuous power
disruption in it's locality.
	   Later police intercepted and brought the situation under
control. Law enforcing agency personnel have been deployed in three
key-point installations (three power office) to save the
establishments from possible attacks. Despite that, officers,
employees and workers of the three establishments in the district
have been working with life threat in the above circumstances.

	   MALAYSIAN rubber prices continued to weaken further with market
staying quiet on lack of interest from buyers.
	   At the close, July International RSS One dropped three sen to
275.0 sen per kg while SMR 20 shed 4.5 sen to 262.50 sen per kg.
	   Buyers were still not coming in at present, a dealer said.
	   He said prices were likely to fall further as the buyers still
taking a wait-and-see approach.
	   He said prices in the other markets in the region were also
weak.
	   The INRO daily market indicator prices for June 9 fell to 193.66
Malaysian/Singapore cents from 196.89 cents on June 8.

	   Most of the residential hotels at Jessore town have become dens
of criminal activities and 'safe havens' for organised gang of
criminals. Although the members of the law enforcing agencies
sometimes raid these hotels , they hardly take action against the
persons involved in the clandestine activities . Only the gay girls
and the pimps are arrested and the 'god fathers' go scot free . As
a result, crimes of various descriptions including sexual orgies
have proliferated alarmingly, it is alleged. It may be mentioned
that the police earlier arrested pimps and call girls on several
occasions from Hotel Rina, Hotel Probal, Hotel Rupali etc, but the
managers and the staff or the owners of those residential hotels
remained at large. As a result, flesh trade at these residential
hotels has been going on.
	   Inmates of a residential hotel dare not bring call girls in
their rooms at their own initiatives. The hotel executives
generally supply these girls as desired by the boarders concerned
in exchange for earning extra money, well informed sources told.
The informed sources added that those boarders of the residential
hotels who crave to enjoy the prostitutes are possessors of black
money earned through smuggling , human trafficking or selling of
illegal arms. The executives of the residential hotels are in close
cooperation of these demoralised people . The owners of these
hotels in most cases are aware of the activities of their
executives.
	   But they keep mum for the interest of business. It is learnt
that two sub-inspectors of Kotwali thana Shahidul Islam Shaheen and
Emdadul Haque raided the residential hotel Rupali and Hotel Rina
respectively in the morning of May 26. SI Shaheen arrested three
gay girls and three clients from Hotel Rupali. Meanwhile, SI
Emdadul Haque arrested three pimps and two prostitutes from Hotel
Rina. The arrested pimps were identified as Billal of Shankarpur,
Selim of Loan Office Para and Zia-ul-Alam . Billal is a notorious
terrorist and extortionist. The pimps arrested from Hotel Rina are
Ajit Das, Swapan Saha and Ahmed Mia.

	   NEWLY elected lawmakers should tune in to youth concerns while
the government should offer young people more chances to air their
opinions, the Hong Kong Council of Social Services said.
	   Over the past three weeks, 9,221 people, mostly people below the
age of 30, visited the website, Supertalk on the SAR Legco
Election, designed by the council to collect the public's views on
the election.
	   About 900 Internet surfers wrote down their opinions and
expectations of legislators and offered suggestions on how to make
Hong Kong a better place.
	   Chairman of the council's children and youth division, Wendy Wu
Kit-ying, said the figures reflected the fact that young people
have their unique views on society and are keen to speak out.
	   ``Youths hold a different point of view about the society they
live in.
	   ``If society gives them the chance to air their views, they will
only be too happy to do so,'' she said.
	   The government should not ignore these voices, Ms Wu said.
``They are the future. They are our future leaders,'' she said.
	   But how should the government tap into the ``unique opinions''
of the youth?
	   Through the Internet, suggests Jeffrey Chau Sze-ngai of the
Breakthrough Youth Village.
	   Mr Chau said the government should invest more resources in
developing the Internet.
	   Young people in Hong Kong had little difficulty in adapting to
the Internet as a new medium of communication.
	   ``Many young people are already veteran Net surfers.
	   ``The government should put more resources into developing this
technology. It should provide more computers to community centres
so that more young people have the opportunity to express
themselves,'' Mr Chau said.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Milosevic's party spokesman warning Yugoslavia
will not accept NATO actions on its territory without its consent. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia warned Thursday it would
not tolerate unauthorized NATO actions on its territory, as the
alliance stepped up military pressure on President Slobodan
Milosevic to stop using force in Kosovo.
	   The warning from Ivica Dacic, spokesman for Milosevic's ruling
Socialists, came as NATO defense ministers decided to mount
simulated air raids and bombing runs over neighboring Albania and
Macedonia, trying to deter Yugoslav forces from further military
action in Serbia's secessionist Kosovo province.
	   ``We are a sovereign country and without our consent no actions
of any international alliance can be carried out on our territory _
especially since there is no reason for it,'' Dacic said, according
to the independent FoNet news agency in Belgrade.
	   Dacic said Yugoslavia does not threaten regional stability or
peace, and denied allegations of ethnic cleansing against Kosovo
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the province's population.
	   Yugoslav forces are defending ``territorial integrity ... from
terrorist actions,'' Dacic said, reiterating that Yugoslavia,
consisting of Serbia and Monteengro, will not give up any
territory.
	   In Kosovo, no fighting was reported by either side Thursday,
although skirmishes between heavily armed Serbian police and
soldiers and the ethnic Albanian militants of the Kosovo Liberation
Army have become a daily occurrence.
	   More than 250 people have been killed since police began a
crackdown in March on militants in the province, where ethnic
Albanians have been ruled repressively since Serbia stripped Kosovo
of broad autonomy in 1989.
	   NATO allies, increasingly worried that a lack of action will
send violence spiraling out of control in the southern Balkans,
apparently decided an immediate show of firepower was needed to
deter Milosevic from more action in Kosovo.
	   ``If it requires military action or the use of some of the
military options to get him to see sense then that is after all
what we are here to do,'' British Defense Secretary George
Robertson told the British Broadcasting Corp. before the meeting.
	   Tanjug, the Yugoslav state news agency, said NATO should
pressure Kosovo's Albanian leaders to continue suspended talks with
the Serbian government, and ``take a serious look'' at Albania,
which it called the source of arms and training for the militants.
	   ``It is no secret that some of the instructors come from NATO
countries, and _ although they are individual mercenaries _
nevertheless are citizens of NATO member countries,'' Tanjug said,
alluding to ethnic Albanians coming from western Europe or the
United States to help in the fight for independence from Serbia.
	   Associated Press reporter Brian Murphy, in the border village of
Tropoja in Albania Thursday, saw a large convoy of mules loaded
with arms and other supplies, accompanied by some 100 armed
fighters, moving toward the mountains and the border with Kosovo.
	   Russia, a traditional ally of fellow Orthodox Slavs in Serbia,
has invited Milosevic to visit Moscow next Monday and Tuesday,
Tanjug said without elaboration.
	   Tony Lloyd, No. 2 in Britain's Foreign Office, met Albanian
leaders in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, and afterwards urged both
secessionists and Serbian authorities to compromise.
	   Lloyd blamed the government for most of the violence, but said
``our condemnation is equally about violence by the KLA in
Kosovo.''
	   Serbia vows never to allow secession of Kosovo, historically the
cultural heartland of the state.
	   Talks between the sides began last month under Western pressure,
but were suspended last week as the Albanians protested a Serbian
government offensive in western Kosovo.

	   JAPANESE share prices closed 1.2 per cent lower yesterday on
steep falls in other Asian stock markets as well as worries about
the adverse impact of the yen's weakness on the region, brokers
said.
	   Sentiment was particularly dampened by further falls in Hong
Kong's Hang Seng index and Red chips, companies listed there by the
mainland interest, brokers said.
	   ``The Hang Seng index, and Red chips, were lower, and Asian
share prices in general were lower today,'' a dealer at Universal
Securities said, adding: ``This weighed on sentiment.''
	   A Kokusai Securities broker said: ``The fall of Hong Kong share
prices is part of the reason for the falls seen here in afternoon
trading.''
	   The key Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange lost 190.91 points to end the day at 15,339.26. The
index was down 107.79 points or 0.7 per cent in the morning
session.
	   The broader Topix index of all first-section issues fell 10.08
points to 1,198.60, with an estimated 340 million shares changing
hands on the major board against 314.9 million shares the previous
day.
	   Brokers said there were not enough buyers on the downside to
absorb the selling pressure.
	   ``Sizable buying from public funds was seen yesterday, but this
is not the case today,'' the Kokusai Securities broker said.
	   ``Share prices did not have a floor on the downside because of
the lack of public fund buying.''

	   A grey sky, getting darker and angrier was announcing a possible
storm. It was well into the summer and storms were quite frequent.
The hot sultry days often found short relapses in the cool
raindrenched air after the storms passed away. Streaks of lightning
flashed across the sky and as the wind whipped up with full force,
the evening caught the passing storm which was accompanied with a
heavy downpour of rain. Crashing thunders sent me, a eight-year old
girl to my Grandma's side. I clung to her, seeking safety form the
nature's fury which played havoc on my nerves. Fear and excitement,
both were inside the little girl.
	   The mango trees outside were heavy with their fruits . Storms in
those days of summer meant carpet of mangoes under the trees. The
storm might have scared me, but the prospect of getting on to those
storm-blown mangoes made me hold my breath and wait for chance. For
almost half an hour the storm passed away. The pattering of soft
rain-drops on the tin-shed over my head told me of the drizzle
which the storm seemed to have left as an after-thought. Grandma
was soon on her way to the kitchen, getting ready for her evening
tea. As soon as she I rose, eager to go out. There was no need to
waste time. Taking the burning lantern I softly tiptoed across the
room. As I reached the front door Gulu, our little servant girl
appeared beside me. She too must have been waiting for the storm to
pass. There was no need for words.
	   Both of us stepped into the dark wet world. Crossing the wide
front yard which was filled with mud and water with exited hurried
strides we were under the mango tree. The wet leaves clung to the
feet. But the feet struck some thing hard. Of course the fallen
mangoes! Making out the shapes of the mangoes in the soft light of
the lantern we started to gather them. Gulu had taken care to place
the lantern beneath a small tree so that it didn't get too wet.
One, two, three... What fun it was to reach for the half-hidden
mangoes as soon as the searching eyes fell on them! A gust of wind
struck the tree-tops. And OOPS! A mango, possibly a half one, and
which had held upto the storm fell, and it fell on my bent back.
The pain it caused was like a sweet sensation, a gift from the
mango trees. The darkness, the rain, fear of snails or snakes?
	   None of these bothered the adventurous souls of the girls who
were busy gathering wind blown mangoes in the skirts of their
dresses. Collecting mangoes in the storm-lashed word was the real
fun, not on how many we collected. Gusts of soft wind moved the wet
branches overhead and sent the collected rain-drops down on us like
blessings from the sky. All of a sudden the lantern, possibly too
wet from the drizzle went out, leaving us in the pitch darkness of
the rainy night. Gulu and I held on to our mangoes. Both of us were
wet, soaking from head to toe. I could feel shivers passing from my
spine to spine. I wasn't sure whether the wetness or fear caused
them. Suddenly demons seem to be lurking every where. Had they come
to pick mangoes too! Snakes and snails seem to be crowding around
us! Gulu moved closer to me.
	   We tried to gather stern from each other's nearness. I felt like
screaming, but what will I say to Grandma. Hadn't she for bidden me
to come out at night? Forbidden fruits are sweeter, so I couldn't
have stayed back and left all those wind blown mangoes to the bats!
But I couldn't tell her that! As we stood pondering on our next
move, rescue came. ``Drop those mangoes and come to me !'' A
command from my uncle came from the darkness as a flashlight shone
upon us with its powerful beams. A single night of childhood
adventure? Oh no there was such more. Days filled with lazy hours
in the ponds, climbing trees in search of ripe guavas and roaming
around the wood, looking for robins nests. All these have woven the
childhood into the rich stories of experiences. Growing up in the
abundance of nature has filled my senses with an immense love for
it.
	   Nature has given me a life with countless ways of feeling and
seeing the world around me. The experience of one night and many
other childhood adventures has given life a beginning, a rich
beginning indeed onto the later years of my life.

	   SHARP cutbacks in government expenditure loom in the next Budget
under a new policy requiring bureau heads to clearly justify their
budget requests, a politician has revealed.
	   The Frontier legislator-elect Lee Cheuk-yan said Financial
Secretary Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen had decided on the new policy
to impose more restrictions on the expenditures of government
departments.
	   Mr Lee made the disclosure after he and other Frontier members
held a pre-Budget talk with Sir Donald.
	   Mr Lee said Sir Donald had indicated he might cut current
government services to allow the implementation of new projects
because the administration would stick strongly to its prudent
fiscal policy.
	   ``I've got an impression that he is not going to give up this
principle,'' Mr Lee said.
	   This means expenditure growth will not exceed the rate of
economic growth, and this in turn will mean less money to carry out
new projects because of the negative economic growth, Mr Lee
suggested.
	   Such prudence could even affect measures to stimulate the
economy.
	   Sir Donald said that Hong Kong must uphold its traditionally
prudent principle in preparing for the 1999-2000 Budget, otherwise
it would violate the Basic Law and international investors might
lose confidence in Hong Kong.
	   He said Sir Donald was working on the medium-range forecast of
Hong Kong's economic growth over the next five years and was
expected to have the data ready by the end of this month.
	   During the meeting, The Frontier group urged the government to
set up a fund for human rights.
	   Earlier, five independent legislators-elect, together with
Citizens Party chairwoman Christine Loh Kung-wai, told Sir Donald
that the government must achieve greater efficiency with its
expenditures next year in view of the economic hard times.
	   Legislator-elect Eric Li Ka-cheung said the Legislative Council
would watch closely the creation of new government posts, adding
that this year's civil servant pay rise, ranging from 5.79 per cent
to 6.03 per cent, was ``too high'' amid the economic downturn.

World Cup: FIFA pledges World Cup balls won't come from sweatshops
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Officials pledged Thursday that none of the soccer
balls used in the World Cup were made by child labor or any other
``irregular practices.''
	   They also said they would crack down on sweatshops that use
children, prison inmates and slave labor to produce counterfeit
sporting goods, while trying to protect the economies and families
of the impoverished regions involved.
	   At a time when images of children in Third World countries
manufacturing sneakers, jerseys and other equipment for sporting
goods companies and their millionaire stars cast a shadow across
the athletic economy, the international soccer federation said it
wanted to make sure it didn't make money off the work of tiny
hands.
	   ``This is a very important issue for us,'' FIFA spokesman Keith
Cooper said.
	   Three years ago, FIFA required each of the world's 40 leading
soccer ball manufacturers to sign a behavior code pledging not to
use child labor or ``other irregular practices'' in making the
equipment. Otherwise, it said, the manufacture would not be able to
stamp the balls ``FIFA Inspected'' or ``FIFA Approved,'' the
highest quality control marks.
	   The blue-white-and-red World Cup balls all are made by Adidas,
one of FIFA's oldest and biggest sponsors, ``in extremely closely
controlled places of production,'' Cooper said. ``We have total
confidence in Adidas complying with the code.''
	   The issue of child labor and sweatshop conditions has grown in
recent years as multinational companies such as Adidas, Nike and
Reebok have registered soaring sales for ever-more-expensive
equipment.
	   Stars such as Michael Jordan have been forced to publicly
promise that their names would not be attached to any dlrs
150-a-pair sneakers or other products from shops using underage or
forced labor, or from those paying less than a fair wage. Some
experts estimate that children working in sweatshops are paid as
little as 60 cents a day.
	   In addition, the World Federation of the Sports Goods Industry
and the American-based Sporting Goods Manufacturing Association
pledged that major ball makers will buy soccer balls produced in
Pakistan only if they are not made by children.
	   Seventy-five percent of the world's dlrs 1 billion soccer ball
industry is in Pakistan. Child welfare organizations estimate that
7,000-10,000 Pakistani children under 14 stitch balls in homes and
small shops, receiving little pay for working up to 10 hours a day.
	   Cooper said that, at an event such as the World Cup, the issue
of trying to keep FIFA's products clean is compounded by another
one _ counterfeit merchandise.
	   French authorities have confiscated 2,500 soccer balls carrying
counterfeit World Cup and FIFA logos and manufactured by unlicensed
companies, Cooper said.
	   ``We'll find some way to distribute them through our charity to
children, whose needs are not quite as strict as those of
professional footballers,'' he said.
	   Cooper also said that FIFA would do more to fight child labor
but had to take a gradual approach for fear of doing more harm than
good.
	   ``It's not a problem that can be solved overnight because of the
economy of the regions involved,'' he said. ``Frankly, if you take
away this major part of the economy , families are going to go to
the wall, or worse, children are going to be forced into
prostitution. I think they're better off stitching soccer balls.''

World Cup: Croatia protests Jamaican refusal to admit its spies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Croatia sent spies to keep an eye on
Jamaica, its first World Cup opponent, but all they came back with
a diplomatic incident.
	   Two Croatian team officials were ``very politely asked to
leave'' when they turned up at a practice session by the Reggae
Boyz that was open to the public, Croatian soccer federation
president Branko Miksa said Thursday. The Croats complied.
	   ``We don't want to make a big noise about this, but we will send
a protest to FIFA and the organizing committee,'' he said.
	   Under tournament rules, he claimed, no one can be barred from an
open practice, not even officials from other teams. Jamaican team
officials could not immediately be reached for comment on the
alleged incident Wednesday at their training camp in Chaumont,
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the Croats' headquarters in
this spa town.
	   Croatia opens its first World Cup campaign against fellow
debutante Jamaica on Sunday.
	   Coach Miroslav Blazevic may know less than he wants about his
opponent, but after Thursday's practice he knew more about his own
team's health.
	   Inside defender Slaven Bilic, one of Croatia's most experienced
internationals, hustled through a scrimmage game at nearly full
tilt after a week's enforced rest because of a muscle strain.
	   The 29-year-old Everton player said afterwards he was confident
he could play against Jamaica, easing Blazevic's lineup headaches
at least for now.
	   ``The pain is gone,'' Bilic said, though he admitted he still
was only in ``80-90 percent'' shape.
	   Blazevic is also worried about team captain and AC Milan star
Zvonimir Boban, an attacking midfielder crucial to Croatia's game.
He is feeling a flareup of nagging back pains.
	   ``I hope there won't be a problem,'' the coach said.
	   Blazevic is already missing the Lazio Rome's Alen Boksic, the
hottest Croat striker this season.
	   More than anything, though, the Croats want to feel the rush of
competition after watching the World Cup kick off Wednesday on
television at their luxury hotel amid the rolling green pastures
and forests of eastern France.
	   ``With the match dates approaching, obviously the tension is
rising in the team,'' Blazevic said. ``I'm happy about that. It's a
state of mind you need if you want to get good results.''
	   Some also like the cool, rainy climate that has given few hints
of summer to come.
	   ``I like the weather and the mood in the team is good,''
defender Zvonimir Soldo said. ``Everyone's impatient to get
going.''

	   BLUE chips fell yesterday on profit-taking and rising interest
rates a day before Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's
testimony to Congress.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 19.68 points (0.22 per
cent) to 9,049.92, as some 564 million shares changed hands, with
1,284 gainers, 1,631 decliners and 570 issues unchanged.
	   On the bond market, where yield and price are inversely related,
there were liquidations ahead of Greenspan's testimony and on fears
that the Bank of Japan could intervene to help the yen, which was
at its lowest level against the dollar in seven years.
	   The average yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond rose
to 5.785 against 5.776 per cent late Monday.
	   Share prices were hurt by concerns about General Motors, as
3,400 workers were on the fifth day of a strike that has paralysed
five of the car maker's plants and slowed production at a sixth.
	   The share price slump will likely be brief and the Dow should
``convincingly'' pass 9,300 points by late 1998, said Goldman Sachs
analyst Abby Joseph Cohen.
	   ``That 9,300 is a number I expect that we will go convincingly
through before the end of 1998,'' said Cohen.
	   Pfizer soared four dollars to 112-7/16, after the Food and Drug
Administration did not revise its safety appraisal of the company's
anti- impotence drug Viagra despite 16 deaths of men who took the
medication.

	   HONG Kong share prices plunged 4.9 per cent yesterday to a more
than three-year low amid concerns over the weakness of the Japanese
yen and higher interbank interest rates, dealers said.
	   ``The falls were mainly due to the weakening of the Japanese yen
and the rising interbank rates,'' said Sean Li, associate director
at Amsteel Securities.
	   The key Hang Seng index fell past the psychological 8,000-point
level, losing 412.09 points to close at 7,979.37 on turnover valued
at 7.154 billion Hong Kong dollars (RM3.67 billion).
	   It was the Hang Seng's lowest level since Feb 7, 1995 when the
index stood at 8,004.01.
	   The index has fallen more than 52 per cent since hitting an
all-time record high of 16,673.27 on Aug 7, 1997.
	   The market opened weakly with the key barometer losing 355.29
points by the end of the morning session.
	   Dealers said investors went on selling spree because of
nervousness in the money markets as the yen, languishing at
seven-year lows, fell past the 141 to the US dollar level.
	   The weakness of the Japanese currency saw the benchmark
three-month Hong Kong interbank offered rate rising briefly to
around 11.0-11.5 per cent from 9.57143 per cent earlier.

	   I had always been enlightened culturally by the good old tube.
After some time, sitting in front of the television and watching
repertories, kind of gets monotonous. So, on 2nd June, it was a bit
of curiosity, the wish to watch a different type of dance and have
a completely enchanting evening. In front of the large, intricately
carved wooden doors there was a host of elegantly attired people,
eager to receive someone important (probably me!). Inside, I
ascended the main stairway and continued burning my calories for a
while, even on the steps of the stairway, I saw some renowned
singers, television personalities and other popular figures. Numb
with excitement, and apprehension, I finally reached the
auditorium.
	   Just outside it, there were floral decorations that welcomed
everyone to enjoy an evening hosted by the Indian High Commission,
on the occasion of India's 50th year of Independence. I finally
(and fortunately) managed to get a seat with a good view, despite
the fact it was in one of the last rows. While the warm light was
still on, I opened the leaflet and got acquainted with Leela
Samson's achievements.Padmashri Leela Samson learned dancing from
Kalakshetra which is the college of Fine Arts, located near
Madras.Rukmini Devi Arundale, the institute's founder, herself
trained Leela. The leaflet continued to let me know that, she also
is the author of a book-Rhythm in Joy.A documentary film Sanchari
has been made, based on her life and works. Besides receiving the
prestigious Padmashri Award in 1990, she was also awarded the
Sanskriti Award in 1982.
	   Before I got completely dazed, the voice of the compere Tuhin
Afroze brought me back to my senses. She presented an outline of
the evening that was to unfold. The heavy, sombre scarlet curtains
parted and I saw a lamp burning, perhaps for the prosperity of the
already prosperous artiste. The flute was being played most
beautifully. Soon the members of the orchestra were introduced.
Vasauti Rao was the vocalist, Venu Gopal was playing the flute,
Shobha Swami and Beramki Krishna were other members of the
orchestra.Before the show really began, I got to know that Leela's
students Aditi Galti and Anusha Lal were going to perform as well.
The first piece was Arti Bandana, where the dance was a mode of
worship. The lights quickly dimmed.
	   A refined voice sang, as Aditi Galti and Anusha Lal came on the
stage to dedicate the performance to God, their guru and the
audience. Under the soft light, the flute seemed to tease their
movements as they performed their nymph-like dance number. They
were flexible, their movements in absolute unison and their
performance perfectly complementary. Already, my soul was so
alerted and awakened that when the thunderous beats came on for the
next piece, it almost literally took off. The Jatiswaram piece was
performed again by the students who again managed to move the
audience through their superb presentation.Somehow, impatience was
beginning to get a hold on me, as I really wanted to watch Leela
perform.
	   The third piece was a solo repertoire by Leela Samson.
Bewitching the audience in a black saree she arrived at last. I had
never seen such a fluent and articulate dancer. She really does
redefine it. She was nearly speaking with her graceful movements.
She was most appealing. Where she smiled, one felt like smiling as
well. One moment she could be serene and innocent, then the next
thing you knew, there was allurement in the air. She was full of
amusement and mischief, where she danced away coyly and gave the
audience a chance to catch its breath.The next piece was that of a
woman who tricks the Lord into loving her. Leela was so
transformed! Watching her one could only feel blood turning to
culture.Her energy and versatility were most overpowering. The
beats of the mridangam (a south Indian drum) simply got engraved in
the psyche.
	   It was followed by another performance by the students.Leela
returned with Sham Tori. In this, she alone portrayed both Sham and
Radha. She showed how Radha wanted to be Shyam and how she made it
happen while playing. She came on stage and gave her bindi to him.
In return she took his little crown. With graceful movements, she
gave her clothes to him and changed into his. She even gave her
bangles to him. As she settled into her role, she picked up a bit
of stone (imaginary, of course) and directed it at the water jar on
his head. It struck, the jar shattered and Sham was drenched in it.
In this way she continued in teasing and pestering him. It was so
touching.The concluding piece was presented by all of them. It was
most complex but immensely enjoyable. They vibrated, they moaned
and leaped to the sound of crescendo.
	   Leela was definitely a proud teacher in the midst of her bright
pupils. At the end, they bowed to us (the audience) in the
traditional Indian fashion.Professor Kabir Choudhury congratulated
them and presented them with bouquets. He said that no power was
stronger than cultural power.Culture ``builds friendship''. He
thanked Leela and her troupe for a ``charming'' performance that
generated much ``joy'', ``happiness'' and ``love''.The lights came
back. I left, my mind full of an evening's beautiful Bharat Natyam
dance.

	   A JUVENILE delinquent was surprised by the good care and
attention he received at a boys' home instead of the abuse and
horror he'd seen in films.
	   ``I had thought it was very corrupt and people inside would
smoke, fight and swear,'' Ah Chung, one of 27 teenagers in Begonia
Road Boys' Home, said.
	   Ah Chung said he was surprised and even touched by the
enthusiasm of teachers and social workers in the home.
	   ``They are very considerate and care for us all the time. At
least they treat me like a normal human being.'' The 16-year-old
boy refused to say why he was sent to the boy's home for nine
months.
	   His only explanation was: ``I hung around with bad people who
left me behind when I was arrested .
	   ``I dropped out of school at the age of 14 and started to work
as a transport worker. After that I stayed overnight in discos and
in the street with my friends.''
	   Like other boys in the Begonia Boys' Home, Ah Chung has to
follow a strict schedule _ wake up early about 7.15am and go to bed
at 9.30pm.
	   They also attend classes and activities.
	   Ah Chung said although he had temporarily lost his freedom, he
learnt to be self-disciplined and started to plan for his future.
	   More importantly, he started to rebuild his relationship with
his family.
	   The young man said he planned to have a job as a bakery
apprentice on his release in September.

World Cup: Romania struggles to plug gaps in its defense
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIOREL URMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALBI, France (AP) _ Ending two days of warmup games with local
teams Romanian coach Anghel Iordanescu still has a major problem to
plug gaps in the team's defense before Monday's opener against
Colombia.
	   ``I'm still dissatisfied with the weaknesses of our defense,''
Iordanescu said Thursday.
	   Already without Atletico Madrid's Daniel Prodan, who was left
out due to last month's knee surgery, Iordanescu told reporters
that another mainstay of the defense, Tibor Selymes of Anderlecht,
has a strained ankle and is unlikely to play in Lyon Monday.
	   Even worse for the Romanians, striker Adrian Ilie of Valencia,
nicknamed the ``Cobra'' for his habit of striking from nowhere,
missed the warmups on Wednesday and Thursday reportedly due to a
bruised leg. Team officials were silent about his chance of making
the team against Colombia.
	   So bad was the situation that in the Thursday game the Romanian
side had to borrow three players from the French squad of Albi to
be able to make the full team. Romania used its main lineup in the
first game Wednesday, while on Thursday it fielded its reserves.
	   Replacing Selymess was 26-year-old Liviu Ciubotariu of National
Bucharest of the Romanian first division.
	   ``Colombia is a technical team and the fate of the game is open
to both sides,'' Iordanescu said.
	   In the main game Wednesday, Romania gave an idea of what its
tactics against the Latin American team might look like, with
defender Dan Petrescu of Chelsea making devastating runs down the
left wing and midfielder Gheorghe Hagi dilligently supporting both
offense and defense.
	   In addition, 25-year-old Viorel Moldovan of Coventry City played
very offensively, much like a battering ram. Physically strong,
Moldovan came into his own as a goalscorer with Swiss club
Grasshoppers. He has not made an big impact in England, though.
	   After another day of practice Friday, the team will leave
Saturday for Lyon to prepare for the June 15 opener.

Mansell injured in crash for British Touring Car Championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DONINGTON, England (AP) _ Former Formula One world champion
Nigel Mansell suffered whiplash injuries in qualifying Thursday at
the Donington Park track for this weekend's British Touring Car
Championship.
	   Mansell, the '92 F1 champion, was injured when his Ford was hit
by a car driven by Mark Lemmer near the final chicane on the
circuit.
	   ``It could have been a lot worse,'' said Mansell, who said
Lemmer managed to steer clear of ramming him broadside. Mansell
suffered whiplash, a headache and a bruised jaw after the crash.
	   ``But he (Lemmer) was aware of what was going to happen and
picked a safer spot on the back of me, otherwise I might have been
seriously hurt.''
	   Mansell returned to testing during the afternoon session and was
expected to race Saturday.

	   ``This octopus is not attractive as it's not alive. It is not
like the one I saw in the cartoons,'' said a disheartened Shova
after watching the dead' octopus in Wonderland.We can understand
the disappointment of a little girl of Class II, as the octopus
that now is on display at the Wonderland is a dead one.The octopus
is a sea-animal with a soft body and eight arms which are called
Tentacles'. This animal lives under 10,000 feet of water. That
means, the octopus can survive only in the deep sea. Octopus lives
in the deepest of the sea and usually it's found in the Pacific
Ocean. It survives for a few moment when it's out of that deep
water. Its food are the green plants, corals, as it's a herbivorous
animal. Some octopuses, small in size, are also found in the Bay of
Bengal.Now, let's concentrate on the octopus of Wonderland. It's
colour is a bit brownish.
	   It's a matured one and its length is 8 feet. It is on display
from the 22nd of May, according to Rajiul Islam, manager of
Wonderland. He also told me that it cost them around 50,000 takas.
The Japanese caught it from the Pacific Ocean and from them the
Wonderland brought it here. It represents the Molioska family. The
Wonderland authorities has employed a senior officer Kutubuddin, an
engineer, to demonstrate the octopus to the viewers. It has been
made free for all as the authorities want to attract more viewers.
Rajiul Islam told me that the ticket sale has been increased at 10%
after bringing in this octopus. His main objective is to teach
young children through pleasure.Many schools, including many from
outside Dhaka have been found to be interested about this animal.
Science teachers are bringing in their students to Wonderland just
to show this creature.
	   Scholastica, Viqarunnessa, St. Joseph, Gulshan Model School,
Badda School and many more have already visited the aquarium of the
Wonderland. The Zoology Department of the University of Dhaka is
also interested about this octopus and they also have laid an offer
to take the creature.Mr. Mintoo, the supervisor of the aquarium of
Wonderland, informed me that this creature's body has been
preserved with the help of formalin. Because it's pretty impossible
to keep an octopus alive in this environment, which is not
congenial for the octopus.Rajiul Islam told me that they are trying
to bring in Dolphins from Sri Lanka and it would be the first time
in our country.
	   When I was just going to leave the park, a little boy, named
Pallab of Class IV, told me that he found the octopus was very
interesting and he came to the park just to observe the octopus.
So, young friends if you have the time just drop by Wonderland and
have an experience with the octopus though it's not alive. The
authorities have decided to expand its displaying days as the
schools and guardians have asked them to do so. So, don't waste
time, go to Wonderland and see the Octopus!

	   IPOH, Wed. - The State Government is looking into the
possibility of reopening tin mines which have the necessary
infrastructure in place.
	   Menteri Besar Tan Sri Ramli Ngah Talib said in view of the
improved tin price which appeared to be maintaining its position,
such tin mines would prove to be viable and profitable.
	   Ramli said if operating costs of the mines could be reduced, the
viability of reactivating the mines would increase.
	   He added that new tin mines would not be considered and neither
would those which lacked proper infrastructure as these mines would
not be viable.
	   ``From being a major exporter of tin, Malaysia is now a net
importer to the tune of some RM80 million annually. The aim of
reopening the mines is to find ways to reduce the country's import
bill,'' he said after chairing the State Executive Council meeting
today.
	   Malaysia uses 7,000 tonnes of tin annually of which only 5,000
tonnes are mined locally.
	   Ramli said discussions would be held with the Land and Mines
Department to identify tin mines which can be reopened.
	   Perak currently has only 18 tin mines which are active in
comparison with 543 mines which were producing the ore in 1976.
	   Late last month, Kuala Lumpur Tin Market chairman Datuk Mohd
Ajib Anuar was reported to have said that the Malaysian Chamber of
Mines planned to submit a memorandum with appropriate
recommendations for the revival of the tin industry to the Primary
Industries Ministry as well as to the Selangor and Perak State
Governments.
	   This move was lauded by the All Malaya Chinese Mining
Association which said the reopening of tin mines would also
provide jobs especially for those who have been retrenched as a
result of the current economic problems.
	   For the first time since the late 1980's the Perak Government
collected RM253,799.89 in royalties from tin for the eight months
between October last year and April this year.
	   Royalties are only collected when the price of tin is above RM20
per kilo.

International police seek to stymie illegal art trafficking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Police officers from 23 countries met
in Budapest to seek more efficient ways to combat illegal traffic
in art treasures, a police official said Thursday.
	   Held under the auspices of Interpol, the International Police
Organization, the three-day closed meeting allowed the officers to
make personal contact and to help their East European counterparts
catch up.
	   ``We have a five-member team working on illegal art traffic, and
the group was set up only this April, while France has over 30
policemen in the same detail and with many years of experience,''
Hungarian police Col. Tamas Simon said.
	   Illegal art traffic is a growth industry.
	   In 1990, the year after communism collapsed, there were 702
registered cases in Hungary, and the total value of the stolen
treasures was 71 million forints (dlrs 340,000 in present terms).
	   In 1993, there were in 1996, 1,025 cases involving 430 million
forints (dlrs two million) worth of stolen treasures.
	   ``This is a special area of police work as stolen art may not
appear for 30 years on the market,'' said Jean Pierre Jouanny,
director of the French national bureau of Interpol.
	   Hungary is largely a transit country for stolen art, with the
line of traffic moving from east to west.
	   Work is underway in cataloging the country's art treasures,
establishing a data base and a network of contacts among art
dealers, auctioneers and museums.

	   NON-government organisations (NGOs) have been urged to improve
services to meet international standards.
	   Speaking after the Begonia Road Boy's Home and Pui Yin Juvenile
Home were granted an internationally recognised service quality
award, Director of Social Welfare Andrew Leung Kin-pong said such
efforts to improve work quality should be made by all NGOs.
	   He said the organisations should work towards being granted an
ISO 9000 certificate, awarded for good working procedures.
	   The international standard, which is designed to give customers
confidence in the quality of an organisation's work, has been
extensively adopted by private businesses worldwide.
	   Mr Leung stressed the two juvenile homes were only ``a starting
point'' and that the department would not be complacent.
	   ``There is still a long way to go because we (the department)
have numerous servicing units including the NGOs providing
different kinds of services.
	   ``We also hope this culture (of improving work standards) will
be gradually implemented in the NGOs,'' Mr Leung told the
gathering.
	   Meanwhile, Stephen Chan Siu-yuen, executive director of the
Society of Homes for the Handicapped, also agreed the ISO9000
certificate would help social organisations achieve better
management and services.
	   Mr Chan said a sheltered workshop under the society was also
considering applying for the qualification.
	   Dr Sam Ho Kwong-ming from the Department of Finance and Decision
Sciences, at the Baptist University, has a different view.
	   He said the award would be helpful to upgrade a large
organisation like the 5,000-strong Social Welfare Department.

	   DESPITE the economic downwturn food and beverage manufacturer
Yeo Hiap Seng (Malaysia) Bhd managed to increase its share in the
non-carbonated soft drinks market to 60 per cent for the year ended
Dec 31, 1997.
	   Previously, the market share was 54 per cent.
	   The non-carbonated soft drink market in Malaysia consists of 149
million litres. It is 35 per cent of the total soft drink market of
437 million litres.
	   Yeo Hiap Seng financial director Chew Eng Chan yesterday said
this year the company intends to sustain its share in the
non-carbonated soft drink market.
	   ``For the first quarter of this year, we have performed
satisfactorily in terms of sales,'' he said.
	   The company also claims to be the country's leader in the
locally canned food market in terms of volume and range of
products.
	   Apart from manufacturing food and beverage under the brand name
Yeo's, Yeo Hiap Seng also distributes food and beverage items of
others.
	   Recently, the company was appointed as the sole distributor of
the Pagoda brand groundnuts.
	   Speaking at Yeo Hiap Seng's annual general meeting in Petaling
Jaya, chairman Datuk Borhan Kuntom said the company's operating
costs had increased between 50 and 70 per cent due to the weakening
ringgit.
	   ``We have to import some raw materials such as soft drink
concentrates and milk powder. Some of the raw material prices have
increased in tandem with the weakening ringgit.
	   ``In addition, it is difficult to source our raw materials such
as milk powder locally. At present, we import milk powder from
Australia and New Zealand.''
	   He added that the company would ``go all out'' to discover ways
to localise products through research and development.
	   On Yeo Hiap Seng's food and beverage products, he said the
company would increase the retail price for the products only if
other players increased the prices of their products.
	   ``To date, to maintain our competitiveness, we have absorbed
most of the increased production costs.
	   ``In future, any price increase for our products will depend on
the Food and Beverage Association. If the association members agree
to increase prices of products than we will also increase the
prices.''
	   Yeo Hiap Seng's group pre-tax profit declined 12.9 per cent to
RM30.15 million for the year ended Dec 31, 1997, from RM34.61
million previously.
	   Its turnover increased 4.5 per cent to RM493.25 million from
RM471.85 million in 1996.

	   Fortunately the country has escaped what could have been a major
disaster in the wake of the BNP-led long march. Tension was rising
almost to flashpoint at Kanchpur during the nine-hour haltage
caused by contrived road blocks. Peace was indeed broken, sporadic
clashes took place, gunshots were fired and about 200 people were
injured. The thoughtless acts that were witnessed could have led to
far greater tragedy, since in such volatile situation one spark is
enough to set off a conflagration.The programme was organised to
oppose the enactment of laws making provision for a Regional
Council and three Hill District Councils under the Chittagong Hill
Tracts peace accord. The BNP had given notice of its long march
well in advance.
	   The ruling Awami League had announced that it would not resist.
Conflicting reports have been given about what happened at
Kanchpur. BNP chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia accused the government
of deliberately creating obstruction though it had promised not to
do so. Buses and trucks were seized, for instance. She further
charged that MPs of the ruling party unleashed terrorism. The
police version, on the other hand, has blamed participants in the
long march for damaging trucks and also a bus. We are in no
position to refute or corroborate either accusation. An impartial
probe body should come out with the truth. Commonsense, however,
suggests that participants in the long march could have no motive
for damaging vehicles which could delay or halt their long march.
	   Meanwhile, latest report states that the long march has reached
its destination. One hopes the programme ends without generating
further heat.We would again stress that the path of confrontation
will bring no good to either side. While reserving their rights to
pursue their programmes and express their views, both the ruling
party and the Opposition should work fully to maintain peace and
eschew violence, strengthening the democratic process.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Thirty-one photographs taken by Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto went on display in Moscow on Thursday in
an exhibition opened by his wife, Kumiko.
	   ``I want this exhibition to be a modest contribution to the
construction of a bridge which will bring together the peoples of
Japan and Russia entering the 21st century,'' Mrs. Hashimoto said,
reading a message from her husband.
	   The pictures on display at the Tretyakov Gallery include three
taken when the Japanese leader met Russian President Boris Yeltsin
in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk in 1997.

	   INTERNATIONAL Business Machines Corp is focusing its efforts on
empowering Asia-Pacific broadcasters with the infrastructure and
tools critical for exploiting the industry's transition from
analogue to digital technologies.
	   According to IBM's Global Telecommunications and Media
Industries vice president for broadcasting, cable and sports
William Moses, the media and entertainment industries are among the
most dynamic and technologically- driven markets, especially in
emerging economies such as Asia.
	   These, he said, provide IBM with extraordinary growth
opportunities.
	   It is estimated that US$1 trillion (about RM4 trillion) is spent
globally on telecommunications and media services and products.
	   ``Accelerating the trend towards digitisation is the emergence
of network computing and the explosion of the Internet that is
creating powerful shifts in technology selection and use,'' said
Moses.
	   He said in order to take advantage of the potential of network
computing, it is rapidly becoming apparent that companies,
especially larger enterprises, should form partnerships with
technology providers.
	   While the drive to digital is inevitable, IBM believes that the
migration will be evolutionary rather then revolutionary with
analogue and digital co-existing into the next millennium.
	   ``Broadcasters in Asia-Pacific need to prepare now by investing
in a digital infrastructure that opens a whole new world of
managing their valuable assets, from generating new programmes to
transporting content,''
	   Moses told a regional Press conference which was held in
Singapore last week in conjunction with Broadcast Asia '98
exhibition.
	   ``While IBM is not in the broadcasting business, we are a leader
in the technology that is driving that industry. Not only do we
understand the technology, we also have the global reach and
expertise.''
	   Moses said as a solutions provider, IBM has the capabilities to
provide these companies with solutions that incorporate
leading-edge technology to enable them to reduce costs, and extend
their brand and share in their go- to-market risk.
	   IBM provides industry-specific solutions and services to these
companies that will accelerate process transformation, achieve
effective cost reduction and establish new markets.
	   Among the solutions offered are news archive application, video
page editor, information navigation system, sports solutions,
digital library Avid connection, content distribution and spot
insertion solution and logicast intranet broadcasting.
	   Also in the offing is a digital and media asset management - the
acquisition, management, modification and distribution of content.
	   Media asset management includes the enabling of digital
infrastructure, the assets of underlying business processes that
manage rights, financial, royalties, location and availability of
assets. It also includes the ability to store, capture, create,
retrieve, process, manipulate, market and distribute content.

	   As the political heat generated by India's nuclear explosions of
May 11 and 13 and Pakistan's tit-for-tat explosions two weeks later
is beginning to cool off, both antagonists appear ready to meet and
talk peace. This is a welcome development and a good sign. The
bellicose statements issued by some Indian ministers in the wake of
nuclear tests had drawn sharp response from the Pakistani leaders.
Weeks after the two South Asian adversaries ``settled scores'' by
conducting an equal number of nuclear tests in defiance of
overwhelming international pressure against doing so, they are now
poised to open dialogue, all other conditions permitting.
	   There is no doubt that both India and Pakistan have redrawn the
map of global power and ambition with their competitive nuclear
tests. Both countries earned the de facto membership of the
exclusive nuclear club which is now restricted to five, all of whom
are permanent members of the Security Council. But de jure
membership they will not have, at least in the foreseeable future,
as there is no provision for admittance of new members. India as
the second most populous country of the world with an emerging
economy wants to assert its status as a power to reckon with and be
recognised as such. It resents being ``sermonised'' by the
industrial powers and accuses the Five Security Council members of
double standard in the matter of nuclear non-proliferation and
disarmament.
	   India may have logic in its argument as far as disarmament goes
but the way to attain its goal of becoming an important player on
the world stage commensurate with its size is not the nuclear path.
The future well-being of India and Pakistan does not lie in
military build-up but in the economic emancipation of their
peoples. India with its bigger economy will not feel the tough
economic sanctions imposed as much as Pakistan will, since the
latter's economy is weaker and fragile. In the ultimate analysis it
is the poor people of these two countries who are going to suffer
most. The Security Council and the G-8 countries should continue
their efforts to persuade the two countries to stop the arms race
and at the same time should also ensure that the sanctions do not
increase their poverty level.
	   Meanwhile, if the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan cannot
make it convenient to meet immediately to discuss their bilateral
contentious issues, the forthcoming SAARC summit to be held in Sri
Lanka early next month will provide them an excellent opportunity
to hold bilateral summit outside the main conference hall. The two
leaders, both of whom are known to be moderates, can demonstrate
their leadership quality by announcing an end to further nuclear
tests and removing the fear of a nuclear holocaust. If they can
succeed in doing so they will have taken a giant step forward
towards peace in South Asia.

	   HUNDREDS of votes were wasted in the 24 May elections, all
because of a writing pad with a transparent plastic cover,
Democrats complained yesterday.
	   Many voters, particularly elderly ones with poor eyesight, wrote
on the plastic cover instead of the ballot itself, making it
invalid.
	   Democratic Party core member Fred Li Wah-ming raised the problem
with the Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC).
	   Mr Li said voters were given a writing pad with a plastic cover
to protect the ballot when they entered the polling station.
	   He quoted Chief Electoral Officer Li Wing as saying that the
plastic cover served another function, which was to prevent voters
from taking away the ballot.
	   The problem lay with the transparency of the plastic cover.
``Many elderly people made their mark on the cover, rather than on
the ballot paper, because the paper could be seen through the
transparent cover,'' he explained.
	   ``This resulted in lots of invalidated ballots.'' Mr Li said he
found hundreds of invalid ballots in his constituency.
	   He said the electoral officer promised to take up the problem
with EAC chairman Justice Woo Kwok-hing and the three commission
members when they come back from their leave next month.
	   Another problem he raised with the EAC concerned the failure of
many voters to receive notification of voting letters. Some got
them only four days before the poll.
	   Mr Li's Raymond Luk Yiu-man said all residents in a private
building in Mong Kok failed to get any notification.
	   Another Democrat, Francis Tang Chi-ho, quoted Electoral Officer
Li as saying he would ask the post office why many voters did not
get their notification letters.
	   The Democrats also asked that polling stations be moved closer
to residential areas for the next election, that EAC staff be
assigned outside stations to prevent illegal canvassing of votes,
and that the amount of election materials sent to households be
reduced.

	   THE Government has set up a cross-agency body called the
National E- Commerce Committee (NEEC) to develop a framework which
will define the country's strategic positioning in the realm of
electronic commerce (e- commerce).
	   Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad is expected to
unveil the framework at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operations
summit, scheduled to be held in Kuala Lumpur in November this year.
	   The framework will include Malaysia's strategic positioning and
leadership with regards to cross-border e-commerce activities such
as between countries in the Asean region.
	   According to Multimedia Development Corporation's (MDC) senior
manager of borderless marketing Dr Han Chun Kwong, the framework
will also define the Government's role in supporting and providing
the jump-start processes and implementation of mechanisms for
e-commerce. ``It will also define the industry's role, and identify
industry segmentation, and product or market niches in
e-commerce,'' Han told Computimes on Monday.
	   The committee, which has started work, is chaired by Chief
Secretary to the Government Tan Sri Abdul Halim Ali, and operates
with two sub- committees. One of them is chaired by the Energy,
Telecommunications and Posts Ministry and handles the electronic
infrastructure for enabling e- commerce, while the other is headed
by the International Trade and Industry and looks into e-commerce
trade issues. MDC serves as the secretariat for the NEEC.
	   According to Han, the framework is expected to set performance
indicators, critical success factors and monitoring mechanisms for
e- commerce at the corporate, industry and macro-economic levels,
as well as mechanisms to track e-commerce transactions which take
place in the country, for macro-planning purposes.
	   In addition, the framework will cover issues crucial to develop
a conducive environment for e-commerce, he added.
	   The issues will form the country's guiding principles in the
areas of Customs, Internet taxes, payment systems, intellectual
property protection, privacy, security, telecommunications
infrastructure, content industry development, and technical
standards for inter-operability.
	   ``Also covered in the framework are related issues such as
policy implementation, review and feedback processes for the
implementation of e- commerce in the country,'' said Han.
	   He added that MDC is currently conducting a study through a fund
of RM1.5 million provided by the Economic Planning Unit of the
Prime Minister's Department.
	   The study covers issues such as the awareness of e-commerce, the
extent of its usage and the readiness of companies to go into
e-commerce in the country.
	   Findings of the study will provide crucial inputs in the
development of the e-commerce framework by the NEEC, Han said.
	   The committee's strategic goal ultimately is to ensure the
creation of a conducive environment for e-commerce to flourish in
the country. E- commerce is a key component of borderless
marketing, one of the seven flagship applications of the Multimedia
Super Corridor (MSC).
	   Among the specific e-commerce projects identified for the MSC
are electronic government, via the electronic procurement system,
the multi- purpose card, electronic catalogue,
entertainment-on-demand, as well as education-on-demand. In order
to jump-start the implementation of e- commerce, MDC will be
organising a series of promotions which include briefings to
industry assocations, key executives and top management on the
topic. To date, 31 MSC-status companies have identified e-commerce
as their core businesses.
	   Among them, 12 companies are in content development, six in
network distribution, five in software development, another five in
finance, two in smartcards, and another in virtual community.
	   It is estimated that within the first five years of operations,
these companies would need some 19,000 knowledge workers to carry
out their e- commerce activities. E-commerce operates across the
computer networks from the advertising process to ordering, payment
and customer support.

	   Many accounts of misery have emerged from the Bosnian war. So it
is delightful to learn of an event which has left a Muslim family
in a village with two cars and the biggest house, rebuilt on its
war-ravaged ruins. It all began when the father gave two goldfish
from Austria to his teenage sons. Then war swept through the
village and the father died fighting.
	   After stealthily burying his body, his wife on a heaven-inspired
impulse, released the goldfish in the nearby lake believing they
would be more fortunate. And they were! When she returned to the
flattened village five years later, a glint of gold in the lake
made her look there intently. The lake swarmed with goldfish, some
fully gold in colour, others with black and white spots like the
original pair! Providentially, the lake had no predators.
	   Moreover, while the goldfish could not do with a heater at home,
here they were miraculously living and multiplying, even when the
lake froze hard enough for skaters to travel across. The woman
feeling blessed, fed the fish, and helped by her sons sold the fish
throughout the region. And all because of the legacy of the gift
from her husband to their children.

Government to lift censorship of foreign media
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's government will soon stop
censoring foreign media coverage of its civil war with Tamil Tiger
rebels, officials said Thursday.
	   The decision to end censorship must be endorsed by President
Chandrika Kumaratunga before it is announced, probably on Friday,
said the officials on condition of anonymity.
	   But the ban on unfettered reporting by local journalists would
remain in force, they said.
	   Censorship was imposed last Friday after heavy fighting broke
out in northern Sri Lanka between government forces and Tamil Tiger
guerrillas.
	   The regulation requiring the submission of all military-related
news items to a military censor prior to publication was widely
criticized by media watchdogs and human rights groups. The Foreign
Correspondents Association protested that the decision was a denial
of a basic human right and could precipitate rumors and false
reporting about the war.
	   Deputy Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte said the censorship
was a temporary measure aimed at not letting the enemy know about
government operations.
	   Among the items blue-penciled from stories was the ethnic
composition of Sri Lanka and statements by the defense ministry
spokesman. At one point, the censor instructed news agencies to
substitute the word ``terrorists'' for ``rebels.''
	   Rebels among Sri Lanka's minority Tamils want a homeland in the
north and the east to end what they call discrimination by the
majority Sinhalese. The war, which started in 1983, has left more
than 52,000 people dead.

	   GLOBAL sportswear company adidas yesterday said Chinese
dissident Bao Ge had shot at the wrong target by accusing them of
exploiting mainland political prisoners.
	   The head of the United States-based Chinese Voice for Human
Rights claimed after his arrest in 1994 for counter-revolutionary
offences he was sent to a labour camp in Shanghai for three years
where he was forced to make footballs for adidas.
	   Mr Bao said he would sue adidas in Hong Kong for allegedly using
prisoners like himself to make soccer balls and other items for the
World Cup.
	   But a spokesman for the German-based company said they
``respected'' the prominent Chinese dissident but he had probably
got them mixed up with another firm.
	   Peter Csanadi, spokesman for adidas in Germany, said: ``We have
never produced any official World Cup matchballs in China and we
don't have a factory in the places mentioned by Mr Bao.
	   ``We respect him as a person but he probably just does not
understand the marketing of footballs.''
	   Mr Csanadi said Mr Bao was probably making World Cup footballs
for another company contracted for the work by the organisers of
the games.
	   ``We think he probably mixed us up with another company.''
	   A spokesman for the Judiciary, an independent arm of the SAR
Government, added: ``If we hear from him we will study the case on
its own merits.''

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The Sri Lankan defense ministry said
Thursday its troops killed 10 Tamil Tiger rebels in the northern
war zone, the current scene of one of the fiercest battles in the
country's 15-year-old civil war.
	   The ministry did not report deaths on the government side.
	   The rebels among Sri Lanka's Tamils demand a separate homeland,
accusing the Sinhalese majority of oppressing the Tamil minority.
The war began in earnest after 1983 ethnic riots in Colombo in
which hundreds of Tamil civilians were killed by Sinhalese
nationalists.

	   AFTER some dozen underground nuclear tests first by India and
then by Pakistan over a span of twenty days last month, the
power-drunk rhetoric in the capitals of both the countries are
settling down to sober statements expressing willingness to thrash
out all differences and develop friendship. Before the Pakistani
tests, the Indian Home Minister L.K. Advani boasted that the five
Indian tests on May 11 and 13 had ``brought about a qualitatively
new state in Indian-Pakistani relations.'' He warned that Pakistan
should recognise the changed realities and roll back from Kashmir.
In reply, Pakistani Foreign Minister Gaohar Ayub Khan complained
aloud that India was preparing to attack Pakistan-held Azad
Kashmir, sought security guarantees without success from China and
the West, called the Indian ambassador to his office to accuse
India of being poised for a lightning air-strike against Pakistan's
nuclear and missile installations, and readied its own
missile-launchers to strike back at India with conventional
war-heads as it carried out six nuclear tests on May 28 and May 30.
	   Whether Pakistan detonated five devices at once in the first
round, as it claims, is disputed by some skeptics in Delhi and
Washington, but the exact numbers really do not matter. The
strength of the tests on both sides matched, and as the Prime
Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif put it, Pakistan settled the
score (of strategic imbalance) with India. An Indian Member of
Parliament, Natwar Singh of the Janata Party, told his colleagues
in the House that the Big Bomb had in reality proved a great
equaliser,' and India had actually lost the significant edge that
it had over Pakistan in conventional weaponry and military
strength.Whether the swing in the strategic balance has shifted
slightly in favour of Pakistan, with the express declaration of
solidarity by the Organisation of Islamic Conference countries when
Pakistan felt exposed to Indian nuclear blackmail, and with
presumed assurance of financial support from the United Arab
Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Iran to compensate for sanctions when
Pakistan went ahead to test its own nuclear devices, cannot but
worry the West.
	   But then the West has only its own insensitivity to blame, with
its market-oriented tilt towards India, advocacy of moral high
grounds with little material incentive or initiative to relieve
Pakistan, and unconcealed glee in some quarters about psychological
boost to China-bashing over Tibet from the Indian nuclear posture.
To rub it in, the Dalai Lama expressed his support for the Indian
nuclear bombshell.There was no real military movements on the
Chinese or on the Pakistani side of India's borders over the last
two years to cause any increased threat perception for India.
Indeed if any, there was reduction of tensions on the Himalayan
borders promising durable peace at least on the Chinese side. Yet
when India began raising the heat by a grand stand citing China as
its No. 1 enemy and Pakistan only an irritant, sympathetic murmurs
in the capitals and in the media of the West were sending ripples
everywhere.
	   When India exploded its nuclear and thermo-nuclear devices,
condemnation all around was quick enough but punitive measures were
missing or too slow to reflect any lasting intensity of Western
condemnation except by the Clinton administration and by staunchly
anti-nuclear nations like Japan, Canada, Germany, Australia, New
Zealand and Denmark. Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia, reacted
sharply to Indian tests. But in the fifteen days that followed
before Pakistan exploded its bombs, the USA could only impose
mandatory sanction under the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act
of 1994 that obliges US government to penalise a proliferating
nation by terminating sales of defence articles and services
including weapons technology, terminating all military financing,
denying any credit, credit guarantees or other financial assistance
by US government agencies except humanitarian aid, opposing loans
and financial or technical assistance by international finance
institutions like the World Bank and IMF, prohibiting American
banks from making any loan to the violator government's agencies
except to pay for agricultural commodities, and prohibit the export
of technology with civilian and military applications.
	   In Europe, particularly in Russia, there were talks about
persuading India to responsible behaviour and restraint by
accommodating it in the nuclear club, and putting all pressure on
Pakistan warning about international sanctions likely to hurt its
fragile economy if it goes openly nuclear and offering the carrot
of possible massive investments in Pakistan to make it the energy
hub of trans-Asain hydrocarbon highway. Even President Clinton was
reported to have expressed understanding, without condoning the act
of nuclear assertion, that India was aggrieved by lack of world
recognition of its appropriate status.Pakistan was already enduring
from 1986 a US sanctions regime for its nuclear programme under the
Pressler Amendment, which the US Congress in its long-winded
process took the first steps to withdraw. The mandatory sanctions
of the US on India was little consolation to Pakistan, particularly
as the World Bank which had a clout over India on account of the
size of Indian borrowing, only postponed the consideration of new
loans to India without abandoning the proposals.
	   On the other hand, China could not ignore Western indulgence of
India's inimical posture towards it after the blasts. Although
China, true to its commitment to the P-5 members of the Security
Council, did not offer seal of approval to Pakistan's nuclear
retort, it expressed understanding of Pakistan's security concerns
after Advani's threats, which the West simply chastised as
``foolishly and dangerously'' provocative. China assured Pakistan
that Chinese assistance would not be cut off if Pakistan felt
compelled to test its own nuclear capability. With OIC blessings,
the ``Islamic bomb'' of Pakistan was there after a foregone
conclusion, despite President Clinton's promises of ``priceless
opportunity'' for Pakistan to gain the world's support,
appreciation and assistance. The West indeed has lost a lot of
credibility in South Asia and perhaps Asia as a whole by its
misreading of the nuclear shocks in South Asia. Even now it is
interesting to note how Asian and European reactions diverge in the
aftermath of Pakistan's tests.
	   I quote below excerpts from Philip Bowring in Hong Kong writing
for International Herald Tribune, as a sample of the Asian view.
``The Pakistan tests were not only unsurprising but, in the general
scheme of things, have some beneficial consequences.They restore
nuclear equilibrium to the subcontinent. India and Pakistan have
known for years of each other's capability. Now that they are both
out in the open, relations can return to the status quo ante. That
is not ideal, but it is unlikely to lead to nuclear conflict.They
give one Muslim nation a nuclear capability. The Islamic world has
been quite reasonbly outraged by suggestions that Muslims,
uniquely, could not be trusted with nuclear arms. Breaking this
taboo has made the world safer by reducing the appeal to the Iraqs
and Libyas of achieving glory by being the first nuclear Muslim
nation.These tests, like India's, underline the impossibility of
externally imposed nuclear non-proliferation rules. Nations may
decide that such weapons serve no defence purpose at present. But
the limitation of nuclear weapons can no longer rely on American
arm-twisting.
	   The new multipolar world implies that the United States and the
other ``old'' nuclear powers must use their influence to keep
balance: to limit aggravation between new powers, and to cooperate
with them to address problems of potentially nuclear ``rogue''
states.Neither India nor Pakistan is anywhere near rogue status.The
blasts may even restore some balance to US Asia policy. They should
help Bill Clinton before his China visit, and at a time when he is
accused of being overly influenced by Beijing''.Indeed President
Clinton has already acknowledged the new realities in his remarks
to the press in the Rose Garden, before Secretary Albright's
departure for the P-5 meeting. He said, ``we want very much to work
with both India and Pakistan to help them resolve their differences
and to restore a future of hope, not fear, to the region. Let me
now express my appreciation --- of the important role China can
play in meeting the challenges of the 21st century and the
constructive Chinese leadership that will be essential to the
long-term resolution of issues involving South Asia.''

estate workers and Malaysian Agricultural Producers Association
(Mapa) has begun after the old one expired last month, National
Union of Plantation Workers (NUPW) executive secretary A.
Navamukundan said today. He said the union had forwarded its
memorandum of claims on salary and other benefits to Mapa last
month and were waiting a reply.
	   ``As usual we are asking for better terms and conditions for
employment and living,'' he said. Each collective agreement is for
a period of three years.
	   Navamukundan was responding to a query about the status of a
group of plantation workers who staged a peaceful gathering outside
the gates of the Prime Minister's Department requesting a meeting
with Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad to discuss monthly wages in
place of their current daily wages.
	   A letter was handed to an officer from the Prime Minister's
office at the gates.
	   The group calling itself the Malaysian Support Committee for the
Plantation Community claimed that plantation workers were being
victimised by plantation managments through a low daily-wage
structure while other benefits like annual wage increment and bonus
were not forthcoming.
	   The group also claimed that Mapa and NUPW were unable to work
out a ``good'' wage structure despite having met many times.
	   Its spokesman A. Sivarajan said plantation workers get an
average of RM500 per month and were asking for a monthly minimum of
RM750, a RM50 annual increment, a minimum of one month's annual
bonus and retirement benefits.
	   Navamukundan said NUPW would strive to get the best terms and
conditions for the workers.
	   ``We cannot conclude a collective agreement through the Press or
in the streets.''
	   Navamukundan said there were three categories of plantation
workers who were daily-rated, piece-rated and monthly-rated.
	   On claims by the group that they had to pay for electricity and
water supplies, he said workers were charged for any amount used
above a free- quantum.

	   PETALING JAYA, Wed. - A woman told the Sessions Court today that
the security manager of her husband's company informed him that he
had lost the RM1 million that was meant to pay off trade debts.
	   Ng Yuet Ho, 45, said the security manager, Ali Akarbara
Mangudin, then said that he wanted to leave the company and be on
his own.
	   She said Ali also informed her husband, Tan Hoe Kock, that his
(Ali's) friend, Ah Seng, was the person who had paid the balance of
the RM1 million owed by one of Tan's subsidiary companies to two
fabric suppliers, Tat Fong Hup Kee and Hiap Joo Textiles.
	   She said Ali also told her husband that Ah Seng had taken
control of all the companies belonging to them (Ng and Tan).
	   ``He told my husband that he wanted another RM300,000 and if we
failed to give him the money within 60 days, his friends would
torture us.''
	   Ng was giving evidence at the trial of Ali, 49, who is charged
with cheating; and two company directors, Chuah Hock Siang, 50, and
Ho Tak Tzann, 37, charged with abetting Ali to cheat Tan and her of
RM10.4 million.
	   Ali is alleged to have cheated Tan and Ng of 100,000 PN
Consolidated shares worth RM100,000 and 270,000 Metroknit Sdn Bhd
shares worth RM270,000 by transferring the shares to Sidah Akbar
Sdn Bhd at PN Consolidated's office in Damansara Jaya at 8.30am on
Feb 17 last year.
	   Ali also faces a second charge of cheating Tan, then a director
of PN Consolidated, of RM1 million cash by deceiving him into
believing that the money would be used to settle a RM2 million debt
incurred by Weatherwell Corporation Sdn Bhd (a subsidiary of PN
Consolidated), but instead diverted the money to Sidah Akbar.
	   Hearing continues.

	   India's new government, a shaky coalition of many more than a
dozen regional parties, led by the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) means business. Its decision, apparently taken
within the first week of its existence, to test its nuclear
arsenal, was not just a statement to the world. It was directed
more to audiences at home. Ultra-nationalism has always been the
BJP's main electoral plank. The bomb is supposed to have restored
the nation's lost pride. It was also meant to provide the
government with the legitimacy to force its political agenda on to
Indian society. Nationalism, as perceived by the ideologues of the
BJP, obviously has its distinct cultural dimensions. Their
perceptions of what constitutes Indian culture have often been
explained by its mother-organisation, the RSS, a cultural
organisation that imparts para-military training to its members.
	   Their cultural blue-print has been ready for years. The BJP
government is finally in power and is eager to enforce it. In their
manifesto they stress their commitment to a normative moral order
and insist that a moral code is needed to implement it. In fact the
BJP and its allies are in a tremendous hurry and are wasting little
time. In 1996, the BJP formed a government of 13 days that had to
resign the first time it faced Parliament. Yet, in those two weeks,
Sushma Swaraj, the minister in charge for Information and
Broadcasting had made her annoyance with female news readers of the
official TV channels public. These ladies she felt, showed too much
in a blasphemous affront to India's cultural values. So they were
told to discard their sleeveless blouses, raise their reasonable
neck-lines and make sure that their sarees covered their torsos if
they wanted to keep their jobs.
	   An FM radio programme, sponsored by a non-governmental
organisation (NGO) also sent the minister into a rage. Targeted at
youth, this programme dealing with sexual health had a 24-hour
hot-line receiving queries. These queries were addressed in the
programme in a non-judgmental way. The outraged minister ordered
the programme off the air because it allegedly threatened the ethos
of the ageless Indian culture where sex outside the marriage bond
was immoral. Divorce was rare, and homosexuality was in the closet
and considered immoral and criminal. The programme was deemed
obscene because it went into biological detail when answering a
query about pain and irritation in the female genitalia.Two years
later the BJP is back in power and as eager to take off from where
it let off. The enthusiasm of the BJP and its allies to enforce
their culture is marked by its mindlessness. M F Hussain, India's
most famous painter, has been targeted again.
	   He has been the favourite whipping-boy of the 'Hindu'' culture
police. In New Delhi in April, an exhibition on the theme of
radical art that included his work was disrupted by political cadre
and forced to close. His apartment in Bombay was broken into and
ransacked. This was a part of a continuing crusade against the
artist. Earlier, his paintings at museums have been destroyed and
burnt and galleries that sell his work have been attacked. The
charge against Hussain is that he portrays Hindu goddesses
obscenely because sometimes he paints them nude. That Hussain is a
Muslim and a part of India's largest religious minority is the main
reason why his art is now considered a conspiracy against Indian
culture. Enforcement of a moral code is now assumed to be a
legitimate political duty. Bombay, the entertainment capital of
India, is ruled by the Shiv Sena, the closest political ally of the
BJP. Its minister for culture has instituted a Script and Stage
Performances Scrutiny Board to approve all lyrics and scripts for
public performances.
	   Its duties do not stop there. Cadres of the party as well as
members of the Board are now going to monitor not just the
performances but also the audiences, particularly at rock shows.
They are supposed to see that audiences do not behave in a
'vulgar'' manner by hugging or kissing and to ensure that none of
the members in the audience take off their shirts and dance wildly.
Shirtless Indians too, supposedly, have no part in the ageless
Indian culture. A leading media supporter of the BJP defends
editorially in the widely-read weekly India Today', the right of
Information Minister Swaraj to play the moral custodian for the
nation, particularly at a time of moral anarchy when marriage,
single parenthood, cohabitation and homosexuality are equal
options.
	   He is absolutely sure that India needs to recover her ethical
composure. The question, according to him, is not why but how.
Vinod Khanna, a film actor-turned-member of Parliament for the BJP,
at a celebrity fund raiser for an AIDS NGO attended among others by
Hollywood star Richard Gere, suggested publicly that HIV testing
should be mandatory and that those testing positive should be made
to wear badges.

	   PROMINENT Chinese dissident Bao Ge has said he will press on
with legal action against German sporting equipment manufacturer
adidas to raise international awareness about labour standards and
human rights.
	   He said he and his representatives were suing adidas in Hong
Kong, the United States, France and Germany for his sufferings as a
prisoner forced to make footballs at a Jiangsu labour camp.
	   Mr Bao made the vow in Macau yesterday when he repeated his
claim that adidas had used prison labour, including himself, to
make footballs for the World Cup.
	   He said neither Beijing nor adidas had formally denied his
claims that an adidas subsidiary had contracted a China company to
produce footballs in a labour camp where he spent three years _
from 4 June 1994 to 4 June last year.
	   ``I made adidas FIFA World Cup France 98 footballs,'' he said on
the day the World Cup kicked off.
	   The press conference, which also coincided with Portugal's
national day, was held in a dingy flat owned by Macau councillor Au
Kam-san.
	   Mr Bao spoke of ``suffering'' as he made footballs 15 hours a
day as an inmate of Prison No 10 at the Shanghai First Re-education
Through Labour Camp in Jiangsu. Some of the balls, he said, were
marked ``France 98 FIFA World Cup, Official Championship Ball''.
	   He believed the footballs were delivered to the Shanghai Ball
Manufacturing Co for finishing.
	   ``The Shanghai Ball Manufacturing Company and the Shanghai First
Labour Camp were liable for my suffering at the prison,'' Mr Bao
said.
	   ``I and the other prisoners who were once exploited by adidas
have the right to seek compensation,'' he said in a prepared
statement.
	   He also said adidas was among various sporting brands that used
a factory in Jiangsu.
	   Mr Bao said the production of adidas footballs ``brought
prisoners unbearable suffering''.
	   He said they were forced to work ``at least 15 hours every day''
for ``just a few yuan as living subsidies each month for toothpaste
and other necessities''.
	   And ``the food the prisoners ate was worse than what the prison
guards fed their dogs'', he said.

	   TOP experts on global law warn that a UN conference called to
define the terms, duties and obligations of a future International
Criminal Court (ICC) may be forced to make 'foul compromises'' by
major powers with their own agendas. Four permanent members of the
UN Security Council -China, France, Russia and the US -- have
voiced strong reservations on aspects of a future court's
operation. The fear is that combined, they will force a consensus
set at the lowest common denominator, at the June 15 to July 17
conference in Rome.
	   'We see the risk that this significant, indeed historic project
could be watered down to the lowest common denominator. The result
would be a very weak Court, without any authority of its own,''
says a German government position paper on the issue. Germany,
Britain and 12 other European Union member-states favour an
'effective, functioning, independent and thus credible'' ICC.
France wants to reserve the right for signatory countries to reject
the court's jurisdiction over cases involving their nationals.
	   Washington's line could be crucial, but while a possible
withdrawal of the US from the project could pose problems, they
need not be insurmountable ones, said Benjamin Ferencz, professor
of international law at Pace University in New York. 'It will be
better to have the US sign right from the beginning. But if the US
is out, don't let everything collapse,'' said Ferencz, a veteran
lawyer who prosecuted members of the Nazi German SS Einsatzgruppen'
-- mobile death squads who took the Holocaust to villages and towns
across occupied eastern Europe -- at the post World War II
Nuremberg Trials.
	   In this situation, he told an international conference in Bonn
recently, it would be better to go ahead and establish the court
with the 48 like-minded nations and muster later support among as
many countries as possible from among 100 which have yet to make up
their mind. Ferencz told the conference, organised by the
Bonn-based Peace and Development Foundation (SEF), that the US
stance on the Court was 'ridiculous''.
	   The US Senate objects on constitutional grounds. The right wing
chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, Jesse Helms,
Ferencz said, has vowed that any treaty to establish the ICC will
be 'dead on arrival'' in the Senate unless Washington is given veto
power over its functioning. Human Rights Watch representative in
Brussels, Lotte Leicht, told the conference that US objections ran
so deep that the Pentagon was organising its own campaign against a
broad mandate for the ICC.

	   THE Executive Council decided not to tinker with the existing
mechanism on civil service pay rises in order not to send out wrong
messages, Secretary for the Civil Service Lam Woon-kwong said
yesterday.
	   He said the Exco had studied various options before deciding to
accept the recommendations of 5.79 per cent for middle and
lower-salary bands and 6.03 per cent for the upper-salary band and
the directorate.
	   The acceptance of the Pay Trend Survey recommendations is to
avoid suppressing the desire to spend and giving employers the
impression that the government is taking the lead in cutting
salaries, he said, adding that the discussions this year were the
most difficult one in his three years as secretary for the civil
service.
	   ``In the past two occasions, the Exco only spent 15 minutes each
on the recommendations, but this year it used two hours,'' Mr Lam
said.
	   The government, when discussing the recommendations this time,
had to face the stark reality of the economic downturn. ``The
public mood (on the matter) is very bad.'' The Exco discussed
whether to follow parts of the recommendations and not the others.
	   Mr Lam said the Exco, however, decided to follow the
recommendations fully.
	   He said that in the past several years the government had also
followed completely the recommendations and there were no disputes.
	   ``If the government decides to tinker with the system, it will
cause a lot of problems,'' he said.
	   The survey was based on a study of 69 companies of different
sizes and different businesses.
	   He said the pay rise for civil servants each year followed the
pay rise in the private sector in the previous year.
	   ``The government is following the lead of the private sector,''
he said.
	   He said the government next year would follow the private sector
trend this year, which was expected to be bad.
	   However, he believed that there would not be a pay cut for civil
servants even if there might be a negative economic growth this
year. ``But the pay rise will likely be below the inflation rate.''
He said the lower pay rise for civil servants would not help the
economy much, though it might make ``the people feel better''.
	   Mr Lam said the Civil Service Bureau was open to new ideas on
pay structure.
	   He said he would not see major changes for the mechanism on pay
in the next few years, although individual departments were making
some minor but fruitful adjustments.

	   TO serve an individual or a group with obedience, sincerity and
faithfulness, is the duty of a servant. When a person serves the
government, he or she is a government servant and when serves a
private organization, is a non-government servant. A particular
person when engaged and employed in a domestic house with the
responsibilities of performing the household affairs, is called the
servant' in our society, male or female.Those days are almost gone
when the domestic servants were amiable, obedient and trustworthy.
We know lots of stories about the sacrifices and sincerity of a
servant. In the story of Khokababur Pratyabartan' (Return of the
master's son), written by Rabindranath Tagore, where we find how a
servant named Raicharan sacrifices his own child for the sake of
his master.
	   Because ``Raicharan was conscious of the fact that he himself
was at fault for the master's son being drowned in the river
Padma.'' He took the pain and agony himself instead of giving
sufferings to his master. Nowadays Raicharan's sacrifice instead of
being emulated, children are abducted and a heavy ransom is
demanded. Even in our childhood we have witnessed how we were taken
care of and our children were looked after by us. In the absence of
a master, the servant guided the whole family like a real
guardian.But what is wrong today? Servant means a person of
distrust, insincerity and hatred. At times they are real threat' to
us. Even when they are at fault, we are not in a position to take
them to task. I know a family where the lady of the house wanted
the accounts after the servant came back from the market. Proper
accounts were not given which excited the lady and she expressed
her anger.
	   Result was a vigorous outrage and finally it caused the lady's
death within a week and it was published in the paper also.Despite
everything we are very much dependent on the servants in all
household affairs as we can't perform our own duties ourselves.
There are families in Dhaka city where the servants are more in
number than the family members. When we go abroad and stay there,
we do our own job. Ofcourse the system and modern technology help
us there to take care of everything. Both the sexes work outside
and maintain the whole family in a very methodical way. Practically
our system here doesn't permit us to follow what we do
abroad.Domestic servants are also professional. They earn their
livelihood through this occupation. I feel we should take
initiative to form agencies, govt or non-govt, which should confirm
the employment of such professionals.
	   I know of such a private agency already existing and located in
Gulshan/ Baridhara where particulars of each and every individual
are recorded and verified by the police station of the area
concerned so that in case of any mishap, they could be traced
without having much trouble.But getting domestic professionals
through the agency mentioned is really expensive. Only the
foreigners and moneyed men of our society can afford this but for
the rest of the society it is a utopian scheme. So this is my
suggestion that there should be organisations like this all over
Bangladesh. I have seen similar organisations in India long time
back. This is one side of the coin, but what about the other?It is
happening very often that the servants are beaten, injured and
burnt to death by the members of the house which was really
unthinkable in our days. The maid servants are often molested and
violated by the male members of the family. Ours is a poor country,
they all come from a poverty-stricken family. Poverty doesn't mean
that they are to be treated as an object of tyranny.
	   Struggle for existence is not the loss of self-respect.
Sometimes it is also seen that the girl servants' become the victim
of sexual abuse and harassment when the female member has a hand in
it. This is a clear picture of abnormal behaviour of our vitiated
society.Relation between the master and the domestic help is
deteriorating very fast. Prevalence of devilish attitude is
endemic. One housewife was hacked to death in the city by the
paramour of her maid servant who was sacked by her and sent to the
village house few days back (The Independent, 30. 5.1998). They
were arrested and gave there confessional statement. So what is
happening today, is nothing but an act of mindless retaliation and
revenge. Eye for an eye, murder for a murder; for brutality there
are brutal activities. Now who is at fault - the master or the
servant?A social transformation is very much needed where social
structure should be reformed. Social values and moralities should
be given the highest' preference. ``The proper function of a
government is to make it easy for the people to do good and
difficult for them to do evil'' - Gladstone

	   CHIEF Judge Patrick Chan Siu-oi yesterday took the time to
explain to each of the defeated appeal-seekers their right to
further appeal _ and the risk as well.
	   On the first day of new measures to save court time from
persistent convicts, Mr Justice Chan heard from nine appellants and
rejected seven of them.
	   The judge reminded the disappointed of a further chance _ going
before three judges at the Court of Appeal.
	   ``However, if you do that and the three judges find you have no
chance but are only wasting the court's time, they may increase the
punishment,'' Mr Justice Chan told one of the appellants.
	   ``You have the right but there is also a risk.'' Any application
against a lone-judge decision must be lodged within 14 days.
	   Yesterday's solo-hearing by the Chief Judge was aimed at
speeding up the appeal process.

will not accept NATO actions on its territory without its consent. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia warned Thursday it would
not tolerate unauthorized NATO actions on its territory, as the
alliance stepped up military pressure on President Slobodan
Milosevic to stop using force in the separatist province of Kosovo.
	   The warning from Ivica Dacic, spokesman for Milosevic's ruling
Socialists, came as NATO defense ministers decided to mount
simulated air raids and bombing runs over neighboring Albania and
Macedonia to deter Yugoslav forces from further military action in
Serbia's secessionist Kosovo province.
	   ``We are a sovereign country and without our consent no actions
of any international alliance can be carried out on our territory _
especially since there is no reason for it,'' Dacic said, according
to the independent FoNet news agency in Belgrade.
	   Dacic said Yugoslavia does not threaten regional stability or
peace, and denied allegations of ethnic cleansing against ethnic
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   Yugoslav forces are defending ``territorial integrity ... from
terrorist actions,'' Dacic said.
	   In Kosovo, no fighting was reported by either side Thursday,
although skirmishes between heavily armed Serb forces and the
ethnic Albanian militants of the Kosovo Liberation Army have become
a daily occurrence.
	   More than 250 people have been killed since police began a
crackdown in March on militants in the province, where ethnic
Albanians have been ruled repressively since Serbia stripped Kosovo
of broad autonomy in 1989.

	   EVEN for veterans of motoring treasure hunts, another hunt can
just be as exasperating as the first as competing teams anxiously
peer through their car windows, trundle along busy, dusty roads and
argue over answers to the riddles.
	   Nevertheless, they always have fun as scores of journalists
found out recently as they wound their way from the Kuala Lumpur
Golf and Country Club to Club Med Cherating, 321km away, in a Press
treasure hunt organised in conjunction with the World Cup '98.
	   An air of festivity pervaded at the gaily-decorated KLGCC car
park, venue of the flag-off that early morning. Enjoying an
open-air breakfast, each team was given a set of tulips (route)
together with a set of 30 questions as well as riddles for three
treasures to be handed later at the finishing point.
	   Our team got an EON-sponsored, gleaming tomato-red Proton
Perdana Executive. I noticed that some of the participants couldn't
wait to get started as they feverishly went through the questions
while waiting for the group photographs and the flag-off.
	   The questions and riddles involved a lot of play of words and
general knowledge, especially of - what else - soccer.
	   Some of us were either still sleepy or just forgetful and wasted
precious time looking for the answer to the first question way
before a petrol station in Karak, as tipped earlier by Y.S. Khong,
who set the questions.
	   The first question went like this: Manchester United's main
sponsor can be found in a reliable establishment here. As long as
you've been following English soccer, even if not a fan of MU, you
would know it's ``Sharp at Letrik Sound'' (a shop selling household
appliances).
	   Some questions and riddles were considered gifts like ``Present
business inspired by Ron Howard?'' (the answer was Pusat
Cenderahati Happy Day Gifts), ``Old Manchester United player can
make you look good here'' (Best Creation) after the legendary
George Best, and ``Our very own ex-goalkeeper in the fabric
business here?'' (Arumugam Textiles), after the late Selangor
goalkeeper R. Arumugam.
	   However, there were clues that were either ``hidden'' or too
small (like the shoplot number K-9 for the riddle, ``Dog's
address'') to be noticed from the roadside. Some of us just gave up
on certain questions as they took too much time to solve with many
still to go. We were racing against time while battling through
heavy traffic at some points with irritated motorists honking
behind us.
	   Some of the teams arrived at the finishing point at Club Med
Cherating well after the given time. But after the tiring and
patience-testing hunt, weren't we all glad to see the rustic charm
of Club Med and its cheerful genteel organisers.
	   Answers to the questions and riddles were disclosed by Khong
before the winning teams were announced and prizes - Sharp TV sets,
Nokia handphones and Arena cordless phones - were given away.
Enthusiastic applause and playful booing followed some of the
answers given.
	   Question 14 went like this: A period and a change of case in the
right places and this garden would honour one of our famous
pioneers in football.
	   However, the answer Taman Zabidin was mind-boggling to some of
us. Even if you're an ardent fan of Selangor sweeper Zainal Abidin
Hassan, would you regard him (with due respect to him) as a pioneer
in Malaysian soccer?
	   Oh, well...
	   Like a handphone battery, said Khong, the hunt started with high
enthusiasm but dissipated half-way as shown by the deteriorating
performance in the answer sheets.
	   Prior to a sumptuous buffet dinner, we witnessed a colourful Gay
Paree- style launching of Dunhill's sponsorship of the live
telecast of the 64 World Cup matches from France over RTM and TV3.
	   We spent the rest of the evening watching the GOs perform,
chatting with friends around the pool, dozing off on the deck
chairs, walking along the beach, or dancing into the early hours at
the disco.
	   After breakfast the next day, most of the Pressmen were divided
into teams - named after Romania, Germany, Spain, Italy, England,
Brazil, Argentina, France and Holland - for the Dunhill Treasure
Hunt 7-A-Side Soccer Challenge.
	   Supporters and hecklers seemed to be having more fun than the
players as many of the latter struggled with fitness, stamina and
lack of experience.
	   The spectators seemed to agree that Malay Mail sports writer
Fariq Rahman was better off on the disco floor than the soccer
field. ``Hoi Fariq, you think this is the disco floor ah? Engkau
menari disko lagi elok (you are better off disco dancing).'' But
Fariq, from team ``Romania'', managed to score a goal during a
semi-final clash. He was elated as he ran towards me, shouting:
``Kak Yani. I've been planning this since morning, but it's only at
three that I managed to do it!'' Surprise! Surprise! In the final,
``Spain'', comprising mostly older, overworked journalists who were
slower on the ball, defeated ``Romania'' 1-0 - definitely no
reflection on what's going to happen in the World Cup.
	   Those not playing soccer or cheering on the players tried their
hand at face-painting, archery, wall-climbing, swimming in the
club's pools, playing other games like shoot-the-ball, or just
relaxing at the beach nearby.
	   While having lunch, I watched the GOs and some club guests doing
the sun dance around the pool, a daily activity at the club. In
that searing heat, I thought they were crazy.
	   I noticed that Robin, the Japanese-Belgian hunk, was bare-topped
all the time. ``I think he likes to show off his body,'' I said to
the men at my table. ``With a body like that, I would also want to
show off,'' said a pot- bellied journalist as he tucked into the
calorie-loaded dessert.
	   There were more activities after the soccer challenge in the
evening.
	   Malaysian Business' Abdul Razak Chik tested his guts and agility
by climbing, swinging and jumping around on a contraption called
circus school. He was so delighted to have done it this time, his
second attempt in four years, that he kept planting kisses on the
certificate he received.
	   The next day was free and easy for us. While some chose to stay
till the afternoon to enjoy the facilities, others started off on a
leisurely drive back to KL.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Security forces detained four people in Kyrgyzstan
who they suspect were involved in two recent deadly explosions in

	   A bomb on a bus and another in a house on May 30 and 31 killed
four people and wounded 11 in the Central Asian country, ITAR-Tass

Death toll rises in German high-speed train disaster
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CELLE, Germany (AP) _ Forensic doctors on Thursday raised the
death toll to 100 in Germany's worst postwar train disaster,
identifying several more victims in their search of human remains.
	   The high-speed train crash in northern Germany last Wednesday
left many bodies mutilated, making it difficult to determine the
exact number of dead and their identities. Police and investigators
have adjusted the death toll several times in recent days, from as
high as 102 to as low as 95.
	   Investigators were still trying to determine how a wheel on
Germany's premier rail line could have broken, causing the
InterCity Express to derail and smash into the support pillar of an
overpass at 200 kilometers (125 miles) an hour. The impact brought
200-300 tons of concrete down onto the jackknifed passenger wagons.
	   Rail officials reopened the Hamburg-Hanover line to train
traffic on Wednesday, but the crash has left train drivers and
passengers jittery.
	   On Thursday, a ICE driver heard unusual noises and made an
emergency stop less than one kilometer (a half-mile) from where the
train accident happened in Eschede, a village 20 kilometers (13
miles) from Celle. About 250 passengers transferred to a different
train.
	   Over the weekend, another ICE made an emergency stop when the
driver heard an unusual noise.
	   Deutsche Bahn has ordered all of the 59 first-generation ICE
trains, in service since 1991, to undergo ultrasound wheel checks.
A spokesman for the German railway, Hans-Juergen Frohns said
Thursday that 16 of the trains had been inspected and returned to
service.

Thriller writer Thomas Narcejac dead at 90
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Thomas Narcejac, a high school teacher who went on
to write more than 40 best-selling thrillers with Pierre Boileau,
was buried Thursday in a private ceremony in Nice.
	   Narcejac died earlier this week after a long illness at the age
of 89.
	   The two were France's most popular detective writers in the
post-war period, and influenced film directors such as Alfred
Hitchcock and Henri-Georges Clouzot.
	   Narcejac's ``La Mort est du voyage'' (Death's On The Trip) won
the prize for France's best adventure novel in 1948.
	   Born Pierre Ayraud in Rochefort-sur-Mer on July 3, 1908,
Narjecac taught philosophy and literature at a high school in
Nantes, and spent his spare time writing mysteries.
	   He published his first manuscript in 1946, almost 12 years after
it was written while he was serving in the French army.
``L'Assassin de Minuit'' (The Midnight Assassin) was an immediate
success and had his readers clamoring for more.
	   But Narcejac was hesitant, reluctant to follow in the footsteps
of Americans Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammet, then creating a
new genre of detective novel.
	   Narcejac went on to write ``Esthetique du Roman Policier,'' his
own treatise on the detective novel, which he saw as following the
style of Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie.
	   His meeting with Boileau came soon after, and the two went on to
publish 43 thrillers, 100 short stories and four plays. Narjecac
was known as the literary master, while Boileau crafted the plot.
	   Among their best-known works was ``Celle qui n'etait plus,''
(The One Who Passed Away), rejected by French editors but finally
published in 1954.
	   Hitchcock wanted to make it into a movie, but Clouzot beat him
to the rights and turned it into ``Les Diaboliques'' starring
Simone Signoret.
	   It was the subject of a recent Hollywood remake starring Sharon
Stone and Isabelle Adjani.
	   There were no details available concerning survivors.

Novelist Catherine Cookson dead at 91
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AUDREY WOODS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Dame Catherine Cookson, whose novels about working
class hardships in 19th century England made her one of Britain's
most popular writers, died Wednesday at 91.
	   Her agent Anthony Shiel said she died at her home in Jesmond
Dene, a suburb of Newcastle, but he did not immediately know the
cause of death. Mrs. Cookson suffered for many years from a rare
blood disease and required frequent hospitalization. She had a
heart attack in 1990.
	   The author of more than 80 books that sold more than 100 million
copies in 18 languages, she began life in poverty in the Tyneside
area of northeast England, worked as a laundress in a workhouse and
did not begin writing until she was 40.
	   Her strong plots and characters captured an audience
immediately. Her stories have been made into television films and a
play and are by far the best-read books in British libraries. The
Public Lending Right, which tracks public library use, said she was
the most-borrowed author in Britain in 1996-97; and of the 10 most
borrowed books, nine were hers.
	   Her recurrent themes of family devotion and the struggle to
escape from poverty are laced with romance, but Mrs. Cookson
resented being referred to as a romantic novelist.
	   ``I am not a romantic writer. ... Those sloppy, silly stories,''
she once said. ``A strong, storytelling novelist is what I am.''
	   Among the most popular of her books are her first, ``Kate
Hannigan,'' ``A Dinner of Herbs,'' the ``Mallen'' trilogy, and
``Bill Bailey.'' ``The Black Candle,'' ``The Black Velvet Gown''
and ``The Fifteen Streets,'' have been made into television films,
and the last was staged as a play in London in 1988.
	   ``Our Kate,'' an autobiography published in 1968, detailed her
beginnings as Kate McMullen, the illegitimate daughter of a young
working class woman who turned to drink.
	   She was born June 20, 1906 in Tyne Dock and grew up in nearby
East Jarrow, on the outskirts of Newcastle.
	   ``I went into the workhouse as a laundry checker when I was
18,'' Mrs. Cookson once said. ``My wage was 2 pounds (dlrs 3.20 at
current rates) a month plus four square meals a day and a free
uniform.''
	   After years of work in laundries she saved enough money to move
to Hastings, south of London, where she married teacher Tom Cookson
in 1940.
	   During the war they lived in St. Albans, 20 miles (30 kms) north
of London, in an apartment opposite the library. ``I took a book
every day,'' she said.
	   She taught herself to write, and put on no airs about it. ``I
have always looked upon writing as a trade,'' she once said. ``I
simply apprenticed myself to it.''
	   In 1985 she was made an Officer of the British Empire, or OBE,
and was made a dame _ the equivalent of a knight _ in 1993.
	   Much of her income went to charity, directly or through the
Catherine Cookson Charitable Trust.
	   She is survived by her husband. Funeral arrangements were not
announced.

	   DID you know that most of the carpets used in our hotels, in
many of the main mosques and even in palaces are manufactured by a
Malaysian company?
	   Believe it. They are products of Carpets International Malaysia
(CIM), the country's largest carpet designer, manufacturer and
distributor.
	   Over the years, CIM, which was established in 1965, has grown
locally and internationally. In Malaysia, it controls about 30 per
cent of the market. The company has developed a wide range of
carpets to meet the needs of an impressive variety of clients.
	   The list includes palaces, luxury hotels, exclusive clubs and
commercial buildings, motor manufacturers, corporations and
government agencies.
	   CIM also boasts pioneering techniques and has its own in-house
design studio and a dye house.
	   These features offer customers unrivalled flexibility in the
commission and execution of designs and colour versatility.
	   In terms of weaving techniques, CIM offers a choice of five
different manufacturing processes - hand tuft, Axminster (woven),
machine tuft, needle punch and auto.
	   In the case of Axminster carpets which are the most popular type
for hotels, clubs, palaces and commercial buildings, CIM's only
competitors are foreign manufacturers.
	   Manufacturing facilities are housed in CIM's factory in Jalan
Kuchai Lama, Kuala Lumpur. The carpets are marketed under brand
names such as Fina Flor, Prestige, Shangril, Super Weave, Soft
Touch and Mosque Carpets.
	   Consultants advise clients on the most suitable carpets for
their needs.
	   With its experienced sales personnel and creative design team,
CIM is also able to work closely with architects, designers and
consultants to get the work done.
	   It is no surprise that CIM has an enviable reputation as
Malaysia's most creative carpet manufacturer. From plain to floral,
geometric to abstract, in a myriad of colours, CIM has some of the
loveliest rugs around.
	   What makes these carpets special is that they are not only
beautiful and tasteful but are made to last and last. What's more,
we can be proud that they are made-in-Malaysia and definitely much
cheaper than imported rugs.
	   This weekly column is devoted to made-in-Malaysia products,
concepts and services.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The playing field is off limits at the World Cup
for all but a handful of people, even if you happen to be the Wee
Scot and Agent 007.
	   Jackie Stewart, the former Formula One champion and TV racing
commentator, and Sean Connery, still best known for his role as
James Bond, were barred from exchanging on-the-field greetings with
their home Scottish team before the tournament's first match, FIFA
officials said Thursday.
	   Stewart and Connery had made it to a tunnel leading from the
belly of Stade de France onto the field when they were stopped by
Keith Cooper, the communications director for the international
soccer federation.
	   ``They said they had planned to come on the pitch and say hello
to Craig (Brown, the Scottish coach),'' Cooper said. ``We said,
`No. Sorry.' ... They took it like gentlemen.''
	   ``If Sean Connery was still in James Bond mode, I might have had
a different matter on my hands,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ The first games of the World Cup brought the first
doping tests and, while the results aren't in yet, FIFA said it
would be watching closely for players who use drugs.
	   Two players from each team are selected at random during
halftime of each game and taken to doping control for urine samples
immediately after the match, FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said
Thursday.
	   Results usually take 2-3 days to be finalized. Cooper said FIFA
would only announce when players flunk a drug test, although he did
identify the first players tested as Colin Hendry and Scott Booth
of Scotland, Taffarel and Goncalves of Brazil, Abderrahim Ouakili
and Salaheddine Bassir of Morocco, and Stale Solbakken and Oyvind
Leonhardsen of Norway.
	   Any player failing a dope test could be thrown out of the
tournament, as was the case in 1994 when Argentina star Diego
Maradona was found with a mixture of stimulants in his system.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Reported remarks by a television talk-show
host have angered the German national team, which is looking at
possible legal steps against the entertainer.
	   ``We will look at it without emotion to decide whether anything
needs to be done,'' team spokesman Wolfgang Niersbach said
Thursday. ``Even satire should not insult players.''
	   The Harald Schmidt show on a German cable channel is an almost
exact copy of David Letterman's late night talk show in the United
States.
	   Schmidt reportedly used a Lothar Matthaeus ``diary'' to insult
Juergen Klinsmann, the team captain. Matthaeus once published a
real diary of a season in Bayern Munich in which he criticized his
then teammate Klinsmann. The two have a frosty relationship.
	   Schmidt's nightly shows during the World Cup feature a purported
Matthaeus diary _ invented by the show's writers.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Reggae Boyz are getting some pointers from an
intelligent computer.
	   Jamaica coach Rene Simoes told French Daily L'Equipe on Thursday
that a friend of his had developed an smart software package with
statistics.
	   All of Jamaica's games will analyzed. The computer shows
statistics, animations and diagrams.
	   ``You can even ask the computer questions,'' Simoes said.
	   Such as?
	   ``Machine, who generally passes the ball to Davor Suker, the
Croat striker? And it'll answer which players pass him the ball and
from which side,'' Simoes said.
	   Officials with the Argentinean team have also found some
computer assistance, according to L'Equipe. The delegation had
Internet access installed at their training center to keep tabs on
what is published in Argentinean papers.
	   ``This way we can check day after day what you're publishing in
Buenos Aires. We are sick of unfounded rumors,'' an official was
quoted as saying.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Oliver Bierhoff gave Germany the European
Championship title with a ``golden goal'' in 1996, but the striker
doesn't like the sudden-death rule.
	   ``I prefer normal extra time. With sudden death, the games end
abruptly and with less passion,'' Bierhoff said Thursday. ``They
should scrap this rule.''
	   Bierhoff, who led the Italian league with 27 goals this season,
scored the sudden-death goal in extra time that gave Germany a 2-1
victory over the Czech Republic at Wembley Stadium in England in
the final of the 1996 Europeans.
	   It remains the only sudden-death goal in major competition so
far.
	   In contrast, Bierhoff's colleague on Germany's frontline,
Juergen Klinsmann, likes the rule.
	   ``It makes for exciting games, there can't be much more exciting
stuff in soccer, especially if both teams are trying to win,'' he
said.

	   A TOP judge yesterday lashed out at dishonest brokers, saying
they must be held responsible for the recent collapses of
securities firms.
	   Chief High Court Judge Patrick Chan Siu-oi was sitting alone at
the Court of Appeal as jailed brokers sought a full hearing for
appeals against their sentence.
	   Veteran broker Wong Sui-wah, 46, could not hold back her tears.
``Don't you know why the two firms were closed and so many people
have taken to the street to protest?'' Mr Justice Chan asked the
sobbing woman. ``It is because of people like you who stole
clients' shares and sold them to cover their own losses. It is an
abyss. Once you lose, you can never recover and you will soon be
found out.
	   ``You just can't cover 10 bottles with five caps.'' Wong
embezzled more than $500,000 worth of shares from two clients'
accounts in 1996.
	   ``If everyone behaved like you, who would buy and sell shares
and where would the lifeblood of the Hong Kong economy lie?'' Mr
Justice Chan asked.
	   Wong, the head of Lamtex Securities' settlement department, was
jailed for two years and eight months in August.
	   The mother of two read from a statement. ``I once had a good
family but now my husband does not understand me and my children .
. . I do not know what I am going to do after jail.'' ``Did you
think of all these when you used others' shares?'' Mr Justice Chan
snapped.
	   She replied she had but could not fight the momentary greed.
	   She was given the go-ahead for a full appeal before three judges
at the Court of Appeal.

German minister warns motorists to avoid Brenner Pass
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ German Transport Minister Matthias
Wissmann warned motorists Thursday to avoid the Brenner Pass, the
focal point of an blockade announced by environmentalists
protesting damage to the delicate Alpine ecosystem.
	   The two-day protest is expected to tie up traffic from southern
Germany into Italy over the long weekend for the Corpus Christi
holiday on Thursday.
	   The action is widely supported by Austrian politicians, although
Austrian authorities have said that they would not tolerate any
action that halts traffic through the pass connecting Italy and
Austria.

Death toll in cyclone rises to 560 in India
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES the death toll to 560, ADDS quotes from a survivor and
a relief worker. No pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Rescue workers, their faces covered with
handkerchiefs, lit the pyre at a mass cremation Thursday for more
than 100 victims of a cyclone that killed at least 560 people and
devastated India's western coast.
	   Most of the deaths _ 551 _ were in Gujarat state, where the
cyclone first hit land Tuesday. Gujarat's Kutch district was the
worst hit, with 423 deaths. Most of the victims were poor salt
workers who did not heed government warnings to leave their homes
before the cyclone hit.
	   The cyclone, with winds up to 100 kph (65 mph) when it first
hit, had weakened by the time it moved north later Tuesday, but
still killed nine people in neighboring Rajasthan state.
	   As many as 30,000 homeless people have been shifted to relief
camps by soldiers assisting relief efforts. Nearly 6,000 huts were
ripped apart and 1,742 houses were damaged.
	   On Thursday, power and telecommunication links were partially
restored to 5,000 villages along the Arabian Sea. Worried relatives
were able to speak to their families over telephone in low-lying
areas flooded by a 12-foot (four-meter) tidal wave near Kandla
port, 530 kilometers (330 miles) northwest of Bombay.
	   ``My father said his Anjaar village was still under three feet
(a meter) of water,'' said Dashrath Desai after speaking to his
father near Kandla port by telephone. The bodies of some of the
victims were rotting on trees, roofs and mesh of electric wires.
	   Pravin Lehri, a top government official in Gandhinagar, 465
kilometers (290 miles) north of Bombay, said the mass cremation was
held Thursday because the bodies were deteriorating quickly.
	   ``We could not wait for relatives ... so we photographed the
bodies for identification later,'' he said, adding that most of the
victims were found scattered around salt pans.
	   The bodies of more than 300 salt workers were recovered after
they were swept into the Arabian Sea or drowned by the tidal wave
	   The workers earn their living by erecting sand walls to trap sea
water, and collecting salt for sale after the water evaporates.
	   Rescue workers warned of an epidemic if rotting corpses were not
removed quickly from remote villages. ``The biggest problem is the
human bodies lying around on the streets with animal carcasses.
Nobody is bothered about things like safe drinking water,'' said
Madhusudan Mistry, who works for a welfare group for villagers.
	   Soldiers distributed food for the second consecutive day in
relief camps set up for the homeless.
	   State officials blamed the meteorology department for the high
death toll. The inaccurate forecast was responsible for the deaths
in Kutch where more people could have been evacuated, said P.C.
Misra, a top state government official.

	   SHOPPING continues to be the favourite activity for Japanese
tourists visiting Hong Kong _ despite claims that prices were
similar to those in Japan.
	   About 600 Japanese youngsters arrived here yesterday morning for
a whirlwind visit _ a 14-hour stopover from a 10-day sea voyage.
	   It was the second visit for Yafuuchi Mai, a 22-year old office
administrator.
	   She found Hong Kong less crowded than her first visit during the
handover period.
	   ``The streets were full of people. Everyone was excited about
the event,'' she recalled.
	   Miss Mai was interviewed soon after her arrival yesterday and
she said she was looking forward to seeing more of the city.
	   She described Hong Kong as ``a dynamic city full of energy'' and
said this was what made it ``so interesting'', adding that she
would like to come here again.
	   Asked what she wanted to do most, Ms Mai answered without
hesitation: ``Shopping''. She said prices for similar products were
more or less the same in both Japan and Hong Kong.
	   ``But as a tourist shopping around here, things seem to be more
attractive and less expensive,'' she added. But Yokoi Tsuneyasu,
another Japanese travelling on the same cruise liner, the Tokai
Maru, who was visiting here for the first time, had a very poor
first impression.
	   ``Public toilets here are very dirty _ they are much cleaner in
Japan,'' said Mr Tsuneyasu.
	   Despite this, Mr Tsuneyasu still found Hong Kong interesting.
	   ``There is so much stuff here that it almost includes everything
in the world. This is really interesting,'' he said.
	   He regretted he could not stay for more sight-seeing and
shopping.
	   All 600 visitors who had arrived at 9am sailed off an hour
before midnight last night.

	   SOME travel agents in Hong Kong were still offering Philippine
Airlines tickets yesterday _ just hours after the company sacked
about 600 striking pilots and even though it had no firm flight
schedule beyond tomorrow.
	   The Philippines' national flag carrier declared an end to the
dispute over its retirement policy and said it would sharply reduce
its operations to match the 25 remaining pilots.
	   In a surprise move, the airline already said it would sell some
of its 54 aircraft, including several just purchased, and
concentrate on domestic routes to cope with the effects of the
five-day walkout.
	   It had already begun the process of hiring replacements, it
said.
	   One travel agent called in a random survey by the Hong Kong
Standard offered a $1,670 return flight to Manila on Saturday to a
reporter posing as a customer.
	   The agent at Century Travel even offered a ticket from Manila on
Monday, although Philippine Airlines has put a block on all
remaining tickets on scheduled flights beyond tomorrow.
	   ``We cannot guarantee a refund or a change to another flight if
the flight is cancelled _ it is not under our control,'' he said.
	   Another agent at Century Travel who offered a seat on tonight's
scheduled flight said if the flight was cancelled and the passenger
wanted a refund the agency would charge a $100 refund fee.
	   Alternatively the passenger would be transferred to another
airline and charged $50 by Philippine Airlines, the agent said.
	   However, Philippine Airlines said no charge would be made for
transfer of passengers.
	   Unitravel offered a seat on this evening's flight and said they
would know this morning whether the flight would be cancelled. A
refund with this agency would cost $200.
	   An agent at Travel Expert said a fee of $300 would be charged by
the agency if the passenger wanted a refund on a cancelled
Philippine Airlines flight. But she had been informed that changing
to an alternative flight would cost the price of a new ticket.
	   A PAL spokesman in Manila said yesterday: ``We cannot offer
regular flights. We can only mount two international flights from
Manila on a daily basis.'' The only scheduled PAL flight from
Manila to Hong Kong leaves Manila at 5.45pm today.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   The skies were partly cloudy on the north and east coasts of
Puerto Rico where there were scattered showers moving onshore.
Elsewhere, including the Virgin Islands, the skies were mostly
clear and free of any precipitation. The wind was from the
northeast at near 10 mph or calm. The temperatures ranged from 70
to 80 degrees.
	   An upper-level low pressure trough passed to the south of Puerto
Rico and the Virgin Islands Wednesday morning. This put the
northern Caribbean in a drier and more stable air mass. Moisture is
limited to the very lowest layers of the atmosphere. A short wave
low pressure trough will move rapidly southward from the coasts of
New Jersey and Delaware today and will reach Puerto Rico on Friday.
This short wave will cause an increase in showers and afternoon
thunderstorms on Friday.
	   The small craft advisory for the Caribbean outer waters was
discontinued. Small boat operators however should use caution today
especially in the off shore waters due to northeast to east winds
of 15 to 20 knots and seas around five feet. The winds and seas are
expected to decline significantly on Friday.

Laos central bank governor says national currency under attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Quotes cited as received from KPL news agency
 &UR; By GRANT PECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ One of Southeast Asia's least-traded
currencies, the Laotian kip, has come under attack by speculators,
the head of the central bank of Laos was quoted Thursday as saying.
	   The allegation by Cheuang Sombounekhanh, governor of the Bank of
the Lao People's Democratic Republic, echoes charges made last year
by officials in Malaysia and Thailand when their currencies plunged
in value and sent their economies into a tailspin.
	   But landlocked Laos, unlike Malaysia and Thailand, has
relatively little foreign trade or investment, and its currency is
for most practical purposes not convertible. Many major business
transactions are carried out in U.S. dollars or Thai baht.
	   The kip was quoted last week in Hong Kong as trading at 2,450 to
the U.S. dollar.
	   Recent sharp fluctuations in the value of the kip do ``not
comply with the theory of market economy,'' the Laotian state news
agency KPL quoted Cheuang saying. Laos, a single-party communist
state since 1975, has made moves toward a market economy in the
past few years.
	   ``In combination with the defamation by ill-willed elements, the
fluctuation has sent the value in kip drop and the prices of goods
at markets sky rocket,'' Cheuang was quoted as saying.
	   To fight the devaluation, the central bank would raise interest
rates for deposits from 19 to 22 percent while selling bonds to
mobilize funds, the report quoted him saying.
	   Cheuang said that beginning on May 18 this year, fluctuations in
the exchange rate sent the value of the kip down by 16-20 percent.
	   ``The main reason for the turbulence was... speculative attempts
by opportunists during the hard time of the economic and monetary
situation in many countries in Asia and the region,'' he was quoted
as saying.
	   Cheuang said that between January and April this year the kip
declined 55 percent in value.
	   Last month, the central bank announced that 2,000- and 5,000-kip
notes would be put into circulation in June. It explained that the
notes were issued to facilitate ``payment, storage and promotion of
the value of the local currency in compliance with economic
growth.''
	   Cheuang was quoted Thursday as saying that the government
``hurriedly took serious steps'' to cope with its currency crisis.
	   He said a plan to restore and promote the raising of poultry and
pigs was being implemented to provide substitutes for imports, and
that the Agriculture Promotion Bank was tasked to provide funds and
animal feed to farmers.

World Cup: French soccer team is ethnic melting pot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ This racially diverse port on the
Mediterranean is the perfect showcase for France's multi-ethnic
World Cup team. Half the 22 players have family roots outside
France proper.
	   French colonial history may be rocky, but one of the fruits is
the contemporary melting pot that draws on the soccer skills of
Frenchmen of various backgrounds to mount a serious challenge for
the sport's biggest prize.
	   France opens its World Cup campaign Friday against South Africa.
	   In contrast to racial frictions in French society at large, the
national soccer squad had a tradition of integration even before
the early 1980s when Michel Platini, France's greatest soccer star,
made his mark. Platini's heritage is Italian.
	   ``It's a pleasure to have them. I love them. I would miss
them,'' French coach Aime Jacquet said of the minorities on the
team.
	   Much will depend on Zinedine Zidane, son of an Algerian
immigrant and raised in Marseille's rough Castellane neighborhood.
	   Marcel Desailly, born 30 years ago in Ghana, and Lilian Thuram,
from the Antilles islands in the Caribbean, are stalwarts on
defense.
	   If ``Les Bleus'' are looking for a late goal, they'll probably
turn to David Trezeguet, the son of an Argentine soccer player. He
was born in France, but spent most of his life just outside Buenos
Aires before his return to star in soccer.
	   On the sidelines will sit a powerhouse of the midfield,
Christian Karembeu, born in New Caledonia and proud to be Kanak.
	   In the French team ``there is this very natural contact,
whatever the color, whatever his origin. There is always this
fabulous welcome,'' Jacquet said, in an interview with The
Associated Press.
	   It's a far cry from other soccer scenes in Europe, where some
black players can still be pelted with fruit or have to endure
jeers.
	   Racial tension can also wreck the cohesion of a team. The Dutch
squad went down quarreling badly along color lines two years ago at
the European Championships. ``Sometimes it's tough to understand
one another,'' said Dutch federation president Jeu Sprengers.
	   The French started integrating players from Polish origin,
immigrants drawn to the northern coal mines, into the team during
the 1950s.
	   ``In my playing days, when the Poles, the Russians arrived,
there was such a welcome, warm and spontaneous,'' said Jacquet, who
played with them a quarter century ago. In the early 1980s came
Platini and wave after wave from Francophone Africa and the French
overseas territories.
	   All the more surprising were Spanish media reports over the
winter claiming Karembeu only used the French jersey to highlight
the problems of his people in New Caledonia.
	   Karembeu denied it. ``I'm proud to wear the jersey. No one can
take it away from me. I've always tried to wear it with honor,'' he
said.
	   Youri Djorkaeff's father, whose parents were were Armenian, was
the French team captain a generation ago. Now his son has a key
role to play in France's World Cup challenge.
	   When French President Jacques Chirac visited the French training
camp last week, he invited the player along for an upcoming
presidential visit to the Caucasus nation.
	   ``My grandparents left the country by foot and now I'll discover
it by presidential plane,'' Djorkaeff was quoted by the L'Equipe
sports paper.
	   When Zidane was asked what other country he would love to play
for, he replied as a proud Frenchman. ``Not any other nation,'' he
said.

	   WHAT could have been a long session between newly elected
legislators and the chief executive turned out to be a briefer
affair than expected at Government House last night.
	   That was because it clashed with the World Cup kickoff.
	   Tung Chee-hwa's congratulatory speech to lawmakers was purposely
brief so that his guests would be able to leave smartly to watch
the World Cup opening ceremony and the first match, between cup
favourites Brazil and Scotland.
	   Mr Tung had invited the 60 newly elected legislators to a
banquet at Government House to congratulate them on their election
win, though fewer than 50 turned up. Bureau chiefs were also at the
bash.
	   ``He called us good friends in his speech,'' said independent
legislator Dr Raymond Ho Chung-tai.
	   Mr Tung showed his humorous side during the dinner, according to
the guests.
	   Andrew Wong Wang-fat said the chief executive quoted Winston
Churchill in describing politics as fighting a war.
	   ``Mr Tung said one would only experience death once in war but
many deaths in politics,'' Mr Wong reported.
	   ``Maybe he was referring to the legislators as `small tigers',''
quipped Chan Yuen-han of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment
of Hong Kong.

Is `La Douce France' turning mean?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By ELAINE GANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ First it was the Air France pilots, threatening to
take the World Cup hostage. Then the baggage handlers went on
strike. And train conductors, museum guards, and naval yard
employees.
	   Even lifeguards went on strike in May, closing Paris swimming
pools on three long, hot holiday weekends.
	   That is just the short list.
	   What is happening in this land? Is ``La Douce France,'' the
sweet France of quaint customs, tender beauty and joie de vivre,
turning mean?
	   The public is ``paying the vile price of pure and simple
blackmail,'' said an editorial in the weekly Le Point. Meanwhile,
it said, a powerless state looks on.
	   The 10-day pilots' strike that ended Wednesday cost the
state-run carrier more than a billion francs (dlrs 166 million),
inconvenienced tens of thousands of travelers and embarrassed
France just as it was preparing to host the World Cup.
	   Other recent walkouts, of varying length and proportion, have
been little more than a nuisance for most people. And none compares
to the late 1995 transport strikes, which spread throughout the
public sector and paralyzed France.
	   But together, they are bearing down on the machine of state.
They add up to a perception that France is losing its much touted
civility, and is fundamentally out of sync with modern times.
	   ``There is a very strong malaise in France that brings about
lots of discontent,'' said Guy Groux, a specialist on labor
conflicts at the National Center for Scientific Research.
	   Last year, 410,000 working days were lost to strikes, he said.
	   The number of strikes actually has dropped considerably over the
past decade, and doesn't equal those in Greece, Spain and Portugal.
	   But today's stoppages are ``much longer, more determined, more
combative,'' said Groux, and the affected sectors are most often
nerve centers _ transport, hospitals, electricity _ that are
state-owned.
	   The strike by Air France pilots, who were willing to disrupt the
biggest sporting event on Earth by grounding the official World Cup
carrier, is a case in point.
	   At the state-run railway, unions typically file more strike
notices than there are days in the year, Groux says.
	   The strike fever may be a reaction to impending change, such as
the upcoming single European currency, which means member countries
will have to cede some decisions to headquarters in Brussels.
	   Another impending change is the privatization of many state-run
concerns, a must if they are to be competitive.
	   The unions ``are doing battle to have as many guarantees as
possible before the changes are definitive,'' Groux says.
	   Unions sometimes use their strike power on mere nuisance-level
stoppages.
	   The Communist-backed General Labor Confederation called a strike
in May at several Paris train stations to protest a Left Bank
construction project.
	   ``Globalization so upsets the political and social foundations
that France must make detours and take its time to adapt,'' the Le
Monde newspaper wrote this week.
	   Even the private sector has not been spared.
	   Armored car drivers called a strike last week, and workers
locked up three officials of Well hosiery after a cost-cutting
package was announced.
	   And the unemployed have been striking, too. A group of them
occupied an annex of the Labor Ministry on Monday.
	   ``As happy as God in France,'' goes one saying. But has that
France disappeared? Or does the plethora of strikes merely affirm
the contentiousness on which France seems to thrive?
	   ``De Gaulle once said that it's difficult to govern a nation
with 360 cheeses,'' said former French football star Michel
Platini, who heads the World Cup Organizing Committee. ``But we
will persevere.''

	   MIDLAND Realty's provisions for bad and doubtful debts are
expected to be substantially lower this year compared with last
year, according to chairman Freddie Wong.
	   Midland made a huge provision of $120 million for bad and
doubtful debts in fiscal year 1997 in anticipation of deteriorating
economic conditions and plunging property prices.
	   After the group's annual general meeting, Mr Wong said that as
property prices fell steeply last year, a number of buyers chose to
forfeit the down payment and not to complete the purchase.
	   Financially hard-pressed, some of these customers also have
difficulties in paying commission.
	   He said since the firm has adjusted to conditions in the
property market this year, provisions for bad and doubtful debts
would be substantially lower.
	   He also said scaling down the company's branch network as part
of the cost-cutting measures was nearly completed.
	   Midland Realty non-executive director George Wong, who is also
the chairman of the Hong Kong Parkview Group, said the seven
measures introduced by the government to help boost the property
market were not expected to be effective.
	   He suggested that freezing the land auction program for three
months was the only way to drive the property market up.

Gadhafi survived assassination attack, travelers say

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was slightly
wounded in an assassination attempt last week that killed one of
his female bodyguards, Libyans arriving in Egypt said Thursday.
	   The June 1 attack took place on a coastal road in eastern Libya
when Gadhafi was en route to Egypt for an official visit, the
travelers said.
	   The account could not be independently confirmed and diplomats
in Tripoli, the Libyan capital, said they had not heard of the
incident. One European diplomat could only confirm that Gadhafi was
in eastern Libya last week.
	   Gadhafi had stopped on the road near Dirnah, 250 kilometers (160
miles) west of the Egyptian border, when suspected Muslim militants
opened fire at him and his group from surrounding mountains, said
the travelers, speaking on condition of anonymity by telephone from
the Egyptian border town of Salum.
	   Gadhafi was injured in the elbow, they said.
	   The Libyans, some of whom witnessed the attack, said Gadhafi's
top bodyguard, a woman known as Aisha, was shot dead when she
shielded the leader. Seven other guards were seriously wounded,
they said. It was not clear if any others died.
	   Dirnah has been a site of clashes between Gadhafi's forces and
Muslim militant insurgents. It lies in the mountainous al-Jabal
al-Akhdar region, whose caves offer numerous hideouts for militants
who are trying to depose Gadhafi.
	   Gadhafi was scheduled to visit Egypt for nine days beginning
June 2, but the trip was postponed to June 5. Even the second visit
was postponed and no explanation was given.
	   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said it was put off because
Gadhafi had tonsillitis.
	   The London-based Liberty for the Muslim World, a human rights
groups which monitors Libyan affairs, also reported that Gadhafi
had been attacked ``in the past few days.'' But it had no details.
	   The group said since the attack, at least 100 young men have
been arrested from the towns of Dirnah, Ras al-Helal and al-Qubbah.
	   The Libyan travelers said police have set up checkpoints and
were searching vehicles along the coast from Benghazi to the
Egyptian border.

Shell: Overcapacity could shut British refinery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Shell U.K. said Thursday a glut of oil refineries
in Europe will likely force it to close the Shell Haven Refinery
east of London.
	   Shell bosses will meet with the 290 workers at the plant in
Stanford-le-Hope to seek alternatives for staying in business. If
no solution is found, the refinery will close by next year.
	   European oil companies have struggled for some time with too
many refineries, costing a lot of money to operate. The excess
capacity has slashed profit margins and forced consolidations and
closures throughout the industry.
	   Shell Haven processes 39 million barrels of crude oil each year,
but Shell has problems selling the refined products in the British
market, where 10 refineries are making far more fuel than the
nation uses.
	   The supply exceeds demand in Britain by some 89 million barrels
yearly, and potential export markets are awash with fuel, too.
	   Within the European Union, oil companies are processing up to
740 million barrels too much crude every year _ equivalent to the
output of between 9 and 13 refineries, Shell said.
	   If Shell has to close the Haven plant, it has promised the
workers ``substantial severance terms'' or job offers elsewhere in
the company.
	   Shell would not disclose how much the shutdown would cost,
spokeswoman Sarah James said.
	   ``Over the last five years, all our staff at Shell Haven have
made extraordinary efforts to secure long-term viability, through
major steps forward in performance and many operational changes,''
said Graham Watt, Shell's director of manufacturing. ``It is a
matter of great regret that European trading circumstances have
shown no signs of improving, and that we now must pursue this
course of action.''
	   Shell U.K. is part of the Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos., the
Anglo-Dutch oil giant.

Hashish to be destroyed in Turkmenistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three tons of hashish seized by security forces in
Turkmenistan will be destroyed at a military site 70 kilometers (45
miles) outside the capital, a news agency reported Thursday.
	   The hashish, worth an estimated dlrs 6 million, originated in
Afghanistan, Interfax said. The drugs were intended for sale in
Turkmenistan, even though the Central Asian country has become a
key transit point for drugs destined for Russia and Europe.
	   Security forces said they seized more than 40 tons of drugs last
year, more than in all the other former Soviet republics in Central
Asia combined.

World Cup: Brazil still betting favorites
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Brazil remained favorites to win the World Cup
after the busiest day of soccer betting in Britain since Euro '96,
bookmakers Ladbrokes said Thursday.
	   Brazil, which beat Scotland 2-1 in the opening game of the
tournament Wednesday, was 3-1 favorite for the tournament.
	   Ladbrokes spokesman Sean Boyce said Wednesday was extremely
busy, with all manner of bets from 10 pence to thousands of pounds
placed throughout the day.
	   Boyce said pre-tournament favorites Brazil had firmed in the
betting, while Argentina was installed as the ``outstanding
gamble'' with odds halved to 6-1 during Wednesday's betting spree.
	   The bookmaker took a flood of bets on the Netherlands Wednesday,
even before news of Dennis Bergkamp's speedy recovery from injury
was announced.
	   English fans are gambling with their heads and not their hearts
and England is currently rated a 10-1 chance.
	   ``The expected patriotic punt (bet) is yet to emerge and
Ladbrokes have seen little faith in Glenn Hoddle's squad so far,''
Boyce said. ``I think that will change after the Tunisia game _ a
good result will see the flood gates open.''
	   Host nation France is equal second favorite with Argentina at
6-1, the Italians are at 7-1, while Iran and Japan are the extreme
outsiders at 500-1.
	   Brazil's win and the draw between Norway and Morocco had mixed
results for Scotland. The Scots went from 14-1 to 50-1 to win Group
A but shortened to 7-4 to qualify for the next round.

	   THE compensation method for collapsed C A Pacific Securities
will be used as a reference for future claims of clients of other
brokerages that fail, Securities and Futures Commission (SFC)
chairman Anthony Neoh said yesterday.
	   In the light of the CA Pacific liquidation, the government has
agreed to relax the current compensation rules and the upper limit
of compensation of the Compensation Fund, he said.
	   Under the current compensation rules, the maximum compensation
payable to claimants against any single registered brokerage was $8
million, which would be very limited in terms of the amount each
claimant could receive.
	   In view of this, the government agreed that the upper limit of
compensation should be set on a per claimant basis. In other words,
each qualified claimant may receive a certain sum of money as
compensation and would not be subject to the $8 million limit.
	   ``The SFC and the stock exchange will work closely with the
provisional liquidators to verify and assess the claims received.
The ceiling of compensation will be determined on completion of the
actual assessment. However, the amount will certainly be higher
than what would otherwise be available if the $8 million ceiling
per broker is maintained,'' Mr Neoh said.
	   Late yesterday afternoon, the SFC and the Stock Exchange of Hong
Kong announced a $355 million compensation package for C A Pacific
clients.
	   Mr Neoh said the exact compensation method for collapsed Forluxe
Securities and Clark Fung Securities clients has not yet been
decided, but references will be made to the method used for C A
Pacific.
	   ``And as to whether clients of the two securities will be
treated in the same way as C A Pacific clients, this is to be
determined,'' Mr Neoh said.

McDonald's fast food chain to open in Sri Lanka

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ U.S burger giant McDonald's will open
its first restaurants in Sri Lanka in September, an official said
Thursday.
	   Rusi Pestonjee, director of Abans Restaurant Systems Ltd, which
last year signed a 20-year franchise to manage and run McDonalds'
in Sri Lanka, said dlrs 3 million was invested in the first
restaurant, in the capital city of Colombo.
	   A second restaurant is planned, he said, adding that food will
be made extra spicy to suit the Sri Lankan palate.
	   McDonald's has begun training farmers who will supply
restaurants, although initially some ingredients will be imported.
	   The franchise will work with a mostly local staff of 70, half of
whom will be sent to the United States in July for training,
Pestonjee said.
	   Two other U.S. fast food chains, Kentucky Fried Chicken and
Pizza Hut, opened branches in Sri Lanka three years ago.
	   McDonald's has nearly 20,000 restaurants in more than 95
countries.

	   WHETHER it's tiredness or the stress of the new job, Masoumeh
Ebtekar has dark rings around her eyes. Her gaze is evasive, so
it's a pleasant surprise when all of a sudden her face breaks into
a radiant smile underneath her veil.
	   Since May last year, this 38-year-old immunologist has served as
Vice- President, the first woman to hold this job in the Islamic
Republic founded by Ayatollah Khomeini.
	   This formidable woman is now one of seven deputies to moderate
President Mohamad Khatami, elected by a landslide in the spring of
1997. But this is by no means Ebtekar's first important role.
	   In 1979, she was the spokesperson for students who held American
embassy workers hostage for 400 days during the revolution. She
then became editor of the woman's magazine Farzaneh.
	   In 1995, she was president of the Iranian delegation to the
Beijing conference on women's rights sponsored by the United
Nations.
	   Following are excerpts from the interview.
	   Q: Did you expect Khatami to offer you the job?
	   A: I would never have imagined it. It had never occurred to me
to take on such a responsibility. It was a total surprise, but I
did know it was an ideal moment for a woman to step into a
decision-making role on the Iranian political scene. Attitudes were
right. Since the Islamic Revolution, Iranian women have
demonstrated their ability, and today we're seeing well-educated
women take on very important positions.
	   Women have a better deal nowadays with regards to their health,
their education, family planning and participation in politics.
	   Q: Could you give some concrete examples of this positive trend
for women in Iran?
	   A: If we look at the data from the most recent census, we can
see that the rate of literacy among women has risen considerably
and now reaches about 80 per cent, whereas before the Islamic
Revolution it was around 56 per cent.
	   Women have made far quicker progress than men here. And if you
take the example of the Faculty of Medicine I attended, women make
up more than 47 per cent of students and 30 per cent of teaching
staff there.
	   Q: So the fact that there are only two women in Khatami's
Cabinet, you as Vice-President and Zahra Shojoi as advisor in
women's issues, puts the government way behind in terms of
opportunities given to women?
	   A: It's only the beginning. It's a first step, but a very
important one.
	   Shojoi has the opportunity to have a direct influence on all the
issues affecting women in society, and can check that the decisions
made in the Cabinet have positive effects on women's lives. It's
very important because at the top decision-making level, there were
no precedents of women having an influence. Now there are two of
us.
	   Q.: Why is it that Azam Taleghani failed in her bid for the
presidency last year?
	   A: There's no official policy line on what should be done when
and if a woman runs for the presidency. In general, the Council of
Guardians (the institution which determines state policy) has its
own criteria. However, some observers and Islamic academicians say
there is an ambiguity in the Constitution, in the use of one word
in particular, Rejal, that describes who can serve as President.
This word can mean ``personality'' but also ``man''. The issue
still isn't resolved.
	   Q: When President Khatami was elected in 1997, a surprise
victory over a conservative candidate, young people and women in
particular were celebrating in the streets. What do you think their
hopes and expectations were?
	   A: First of all, it was their natural feelings of hope and
enthusiasm.
	   Nineteen years after the revolution, Iranians had voted a figure
from the revolution into power - Khatami, who is aware of the needs
of our time and of changes in society. People expect solutions to
be found to the country's economic problems, the younger
generations need to be included too and they need to feel that
their voices are being heard.
	   Q: Do you approve of the fact that an Iranian woman has to ask
her husband's permission to leave the country?
	   A: In Islam, we consider marriage to be a contract between a man
and a woman, a very serious contract, which doesn't just determine
the future of that man and that woman, but also of other
individuals: their children.
	   According to this contract, the man is economically and legally
responsible for his family. The woman is free to pursue her own
economic activities if she wants. But she accepts other
responsibilities. She has to ask her husband's permission to leave
the country. It means that when one of the contracting parties
accepts being economically responsible, it's only right that he is
informed of what is going on in his family.
	   It's natural that, in accepting this contract, we accept the
limitation of our freedom. We're convinced that the family is
fundamentally for the intellectual, moral and spritual development
of our children and ourselves.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Mozamibican prosecutors have filed
additional criminal charges, including espionage, against a South
African foreign affairs official held since March on a gun running
charge.
	   Prosecutors have charged Robert McBride with espionage and
membership in a criminal organization, said Albano Silva, a lawyer
for McBride.
	   The new charges apparently came this week after the judge sent
the provisional charge sheet, which accused McBride of gun running,
back to the prosecutor with a request for more definitive charges.
	   The judge must now rule whether there is sufficient evidence for
trial.
	   Mozambican law provides for a maximum sentence of 20 years in
prison for espionage and 12 years for gun running.
	   The case is major news in South Africa, where the government has
remained mostly silent but has said that McBride was not on
official business in Mozambique at the time of his arrest.
	   Within two weeks of McBride's arrest in Mozambique, a
controversial report from South Africa's military alleged that he
and others were involved in planning a coup against the ruling
African National Congress government.
	   President Nelson Mandela's government denied the veracity of the
report that led to the resignation of Defense Force Commander
George Meiring.
	   McBride, a former guerrilla fighter, was convicted in the 1986
bombing of a Durban bar that killed three women. He was freed under
a 1992 amnesty negotiated by the ANC and the then-governing
National Party.
	   Mandela's ex-wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, is expected to
travel on Friday to Mozambique to intervene on McBride's behalf.

	   HONG KONG interbank rates (Hibor) rose sharply yesterday as the
Japanese currency went through the 141-yen mark.
	   The three-month Hibor rate soared to 9.57143 per cent yesterday
from 9.05804 per cent on Tuesday.
	   ``The market has become rather panicky as the yen fell below
141,'' said Toby Yuen, treasurer at Bank Brussels Lambert.
	   The one-month Hibor rate rose to 9.38839 per cent against
8.83482 per cent at Tuesday's fixing.
	   Andrew Fung, treasurer at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) sold US$170 million (HK$1.3
billion) in the interbank market last Friday as disclosed by its
equity settlement balance.
	   This led to a retreat in liquidity amounting to $1.3 billion
yesterday from the banking system, Mr Fung said.
	   The retreat in liquidity has exerted pressure on the interbank
rates prompting yesterday's rise, Mr Fung said.
	   There was speculation that the HKMA had intervened in the
interbank market yesterday in a bid to stabilise Hibor levels.
	   An HKMA spokesperson declined to comment.
	   But Mr Fung said there was no sign of intervention as it was a
natural response for HKMA to sell US dollars when the Hong Kong
dollar hit the 7.75 level.
	   The declining yen also contributed to the rise of interbank
rates, said Carlos Cheung, spot market head at Bank of East Asia.
	   ``The yen hit as low as 141.35, but it recovered some ground
later,'' Mr Cheung said.
	   Mr Fung said the impact of the weak yen on the interbank rates
was more psychological.
	   The rumour of negative economic growth for Japan this year and
the uncertain attitude of the Bank of Japan _ the central bank _
towards the withering yen had also driven up the rates, Mr Cheung
said. Concern over a yuan devaluation if the yen continued to fall
was another reason for the rate rise, he added.

	   WASHINGTON -- People and products crossing the border will face
tougher laws under several new agreements signed by U.S. and
Mexican officials Wednesday.
	   After the death of thousands of migrants along the border, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the new treaties will
create higher standards for safety along the 2,000-mile frontier.
	   Truck drivers traveling from the United States to Mexico also
will face new strictures for alcohol and drug testing, Albright
said. If ratified, additional agreements will create tougher laws
for fruits and vegetables transferred between the two countries.
Albright called the agreements a ``firm foundation for mutual
confidence.''
	   She added that other proposals to be signed this week will focus
on immunizations for immigrants and bilingual education.
	   However, Mexican Attorney General Jorge Madrazo warned that all
agreements signed this week will take months to ratify. He said
Operation Casablanca has greatly damaged U.S.-Mexico relations.
	   Mexican Foreign Secretary Rosario Green urged both governments
to respect each other's legal institutions and focus on the rights
of individual citizens. She said that to improve relations,
high-level diplomatic talks must continue.

	   THE ideal mosque is one that nestles in a spacious garden with
shady trees and shrubs of scented flowers, and a water fountain
resting on a large pool of water to cool the surrounding area.
	   The cluster of buildings in the annexe is made up of the Imam's
residence, the muezzin's and other staff members involved in
managing and maintaining the mosque. To facilitate the needs of the
neighbourhood, a madrasah and a community library will cater for
its education and knowledge, and the community hall for all other
activities.
	   The mosque, says Sheikh Abdul Aziz Kamel, an eminent architect
from Jeddah, plays an important role in instilling religious values
in children. Under its roof, children grow up to become normal
adults, far from being the extremists that the foreign Press
propagates.
	   The mosque, as was intended, is not only a place for prayers but
also for charity and good deeds. It is a fertile ground for healthy
intellectual and socio-cultural development of the community,
attracting the participation of able and willing volunteers,
especially the youth. It is the best conduit for exchanges where
everybody benefits - ``No man is superior unto another except in
piety and good deeds.'' - Quran.
	   It is with respect to the concept of unity that the traditional
Muslim towns were designed. All the architectural designs are based
on the concept harmonising man with the environment.
	   Artists and craftsmen as well as traders conform to the concept
of harmony. The artists and craftsmen help to create the
environment that comforts the soul whereas the traders will fill up
every little niche of space to serve the needs of the society. They
are an important element in the expression of an Islamic way of
life. A visitor can feel safe in this environment where people are
God-fearing and they are generous and honest.
	   Their idea of business is ``give a little more and take a little
less.
	   After all, it is not going to hurt me.''
	   Whatever they do it is only to seek Allah's pleasure. In this
atmosphere of busy human activities with its symphony of sights,
sound and colours - not to mention the rich fusion of smells from
attar to food and spices - one can't help but feel elated.
	   The traders selling attar will invariably be closest to the
mosque so that the whiff of its refreshing aroma mingling with the
scent from the flowers in the garden will give off an invigorating
and therapeutic effect on the people entering the mosque. This
calming effect helps remove the stresses of the day's activities.
	   Kamel peppered his talk with words like ``balance'' and
``harmony''.
	   He says that although he considers himself a designer of space,
he also takes into consideration man's relationship with his
neighbour and the environment. It must all be in harmony, for this
is what makes life fulfilling and satisfying.
	   Kamel, who is in his 40s, may appear stern at first glance, but
quickly puts people at ease with his disarming smile and gentle
voice. He is committed to the cause of uplifting the status of
Muslim artists and craftsmen, for he believes they have long been
neglected.
	   Kamel qualified as an architect and engineer from Riyadh
University after which he joined his family's bank where he
eventually headed the real estate and investment division. His
architectural training came in useful when he had to deal with
building projects. During his time with Dallal Barakah Bank, he
realised that there was not one single architect who could come up
with a truly Islamic design. This prompted Kamel to plunge into
full-time architecture.
	   Kamel is reputedly the only architect in the world whose company
has embarked on reviving and developing the traditional Muslim arts
and architecture by employing over 300 skilled Muslim artists and
craftsmen working hand in hand with over 40 full-time architects.
	   The company has reintroduced the most beautiful elements of the
finest Muslim traditions in buildings, in interior decorations and
in furniture.
	   Kamel travels widely and he is regularly invited to give talks
on Islamic architecture from universities and organisations all
over the world. Not long ago he took part in various seminars in
Kuala Lumpur after his lecture at Oxford University. He established
extensive connection with architects all over the world to
continually exchange information on Muslim arts and architecture.

	   THREE foreign diplomats gave a cautious thumbs-up to Hong Kong's
performance since the handover but highlighted the conditions that
had to be met for the territory to maintain its prosperity.
	   Speaking at the Far Eastern Economic Review conference, the US
Consul-General, Richard Boucher, said Hong Kong had ``handled the
crisis well'', but added ``there's always room for improvement''.
	   ``We have been troubled . . . by recent highly publicised court
cases which have created some uncertainty about whether the law is
being equally applied,'' he said.
	   He praised the efforts to stamp out piracy but said more must be
done. ``We are still looking for the days when it will actually be
difficult to walk down the street and find pirated goods,'' he
said.
	   All three speakers felt that the SAR's prosperity depended on
maintaining and developing its international status and
individuality. ``Hong Kong must retain its uniqueness as an
international city,'' said Kunihiko Makita, the Consul-General of
Japan. ``If Hong Kong becomes just another city in China, then with
improvements in other mainland cities, Hong Kong will lose her
advantage,'' he said.
	   The chief of the European Commission office in the territory,
Etienne Reuter, said: ``China has become a protagonist of
stability, advising and assisting countries in the region ... Japan
is perceived as having an economy that weakens and political
institutions that resist reform.''

 &UR; Far from home, Japanese fans yearn for missing tickets &QL; 
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (AP) _ Here in this languid city near
the Alps, there's trouble afoot. Trouble with a ``t,'' as in
tickets.
	   Japanese fans who traveled halfway around the world to cheer on
their team in its first World Cup appearance are finding out, just
days before the first match, that they may not have tickets to the
games.
	   While five Japanese travel agencies reportedly were deciding to
cancel World Cup tours because some 12,000 tickets had failed to
materialize, a group of 76 fans already here waited Thursday to
find out if even that much-smaller number could be met.
	   At last count, they had been shown just 40 tickets by
representatives of Nihon Kinki Travel Co., a well-known Japanese
agency, according to members of the tour group.
	   ``I'm trying to be optimistic,'' said Masami Tachi, a
34-year-old housewife from Tokyo. ``But if we don't get tickets
soon, we're going to take the tour coordinator hostage. We will not
kill him.''
	   Packages of travel, hotels and tickets generally sold for about
dlrs 1,800 each to Japanese fans.
	   Representatives of Nihon Kinki were said to be scouring the
French countryside for tickets to Japanese matches. Tachi said she
wasn't looking for a refund.
	   ``We came here to see the World Cup,'' she said. ``It's not good
enough to get the money back for the tickets.''
	   French organizers said Thursday they were prepared to sue anyone
involved in ticket scams and insisted that all tickets had been
distributed according to signed contracts.
	   Bruno Travade, a spokesman for the World Cup organizing
committee, said he could not explain the missing 12,000 Japanese
tickets, but that representatives of the only three licensed ticket
agencies for Asia _ JT Travel, Ken R Tours and Prime Sports
International _ picked up their tickets at the organizers' Paris
headquarters between April 27-29.
	   ``We have the receipts, signed by representatives of the tour
operators, that they collected the number and classification of
tickets they had contracted for,'' Travade said.
	   Worldwide, he said, 138,000 tickets had been distributed to 17
licensed agencies. Other brokers who peddled World Cup tickets face
legal action, the spokesman said.
	   ``We will sue anyone or any organization who undertakes to
damage our image or intentions,'' Travade said. ``And we encourage
individuals to sue the persons who cheated them.''
	   Tachi and her travelmates trekked to the Japanese training site
from Geneva, Switzerland, about 150 miles to the northeast, where
they are staying after a flight from Tokyo that first had to stop
in Helsinki, Finland.
	   ``We've gone through hell to get here,'' said Kazayuki Meda, who
quit his job at an automaker so he'd have time for World Cup
watching.
	   When the group got to the training site, however, they were
disappointed again. Practice was closed to the public.

	   While bullets flew in the mountains of Chiapas, only words flew
in the Senate chamber Wednesday during the weekly Permanent
Commission meeting.
	   Only Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) Deputy Gilberto
Lopez y Rivas mentioned the skirmishes between Army troops and
Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) supporters in Chiapas,
sparked by the Army's dismantling of a Zapatista community.
	   ``The federal and state governments displace the Chiapas
indigenous people from their communities; they massacre them; they
pursue them; they torture them, and they jail them,'' said Lopez y
Rivas.
	   The center-left deputy, a member of the congressional Chiapas
peace commission, also lamented the dissolution of the National
Mediation Commission (Conai) and the resignation of its president,
Bishop Samuel Ruiz, earlier this week.
	   ``With the disappearance of Conai, it becomes even more clear
that the government's goal is not to reestablish dialogue but to
wear down the EZLN through a counterinsurgency strategy,'' the
perredista said.
	   Although he did not go as far in his criticism of the government
National Action Party Senator Luis Felipe Bravo Mena concurred with
Lopez y Rivas that ``we have not been this far from peace in
Chiapas since the conflict began,'' on New Year's Day, 1994.

Singapore trains to run without drivers

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Automatic trains, controlled through a
computerized command center rather than by drivers, will be put
into use in Singapore when its new Mass Rapid Transit line is
completed, the Land Transport Authority said Thursday.
	   Computers will allow the underground trains to travel more
frequently, as often as every 90 seconds, the authority said.
	   The new 20-kilometer (12-mile) Northeast Line _ which passes
through Chinatown, along the Singapore River and past the prime
minister's residence _ is under construction and a final completion
date has not been announced.
	   The train carriages will be equipped with closed-circuit
televisions, so controllers can keep an eye on passengers and they,
in turn, can talk to transit supervisors if any problem develops.

	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ A man shot in the head in a
restaurant by a gang of masked men has died, the newspaper France
Antilles reported Thursday.
	   Philippe Blanc, 41, was in a restaurant in the southern town of
Ducos at 11:30 p.m. Tuesday when three armed men burst in and
demanded money. Blanc was shot in the head and later died from his
wounds, the newspaper reported.
	   Witnesses said the three men fled without taking a cash after
firing several shots.
	   The victim was married and the father of a 3-year-old boy.

Admiral Lopez of NATO's Southern Command to Retire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Admiral T. Joseph Lopez, commander of NATO's
Southern European command and U.S. Naval Forces Europe, is retiring
from the U.S. Navy.
	   Lopez is retiring to pursue a civilian career, said NATO
spokesman Major Nicolaos Halvatzis.
	   His retirement ends a 38-year naval career in which the West
Virginia native rose from enlisted sailor to one of the four
top-ranking officers in NATO's command structure.
	   A Vietnam veteran, Lopez took over NATO's southern European
command, based in Naples, Italy, and Naval Forces Europe a little
less than two years ago. He also headed the NATO-led peacekeeping
force in Bosnia from July 1996 until November 1996.
	   A tenure of two to three years as southern commander is
considered normal, Halvatzis said.
	   He said no date has been set for Lopez' retirement yet.

	   THE Securities and Futures Commission and the Stock Exchange of
Hong Kong should review their internal structures to reduce
overlapping in their supervision of listed companies and their
responsibilities for market development.
	   Victor Chu, a member of the SFC's takeover and merger panel and
chairman of First Eastern Investment Group, told a business seminar
yesterday that the SFC and the SEHK should take advantage of the
recent sluggish stock market to consider internal restructuring.
	   ``There are some areas which are being overseen by the two
regulators simultaneously,'' he said ``I think it is now necessary
to identify clearly their supervisory roles such as licence
registration and corporate governance, and enforcement which are
handled by them in different ways,'' he said.
	   Mr Chu said that this move would improve the regulatory system
and help reduce misunderstandings.
	   A banker at a European investment bank, who also attended the
seminar, said: ``We are not surprised by this suggestion because
this overlap in their responsibilities has been going on and needs
to be improved.'' Mr Chu said it would be more appropriate to leave
to the stock exchange the responsibility for market or product
development while the supervision of listed companies and brokers
should fall under the SFC's wings.
	   To ensure a fair hearing in committee meetings and avoid
potential conflict of interest, the head of the listing division at
the SEHK should not be responsible for the secretariat of the
listing committee, he said.
	   It would also be inappropriate for the head of enforcement at
the SFC to act in the secretariat of the takeover and merger panel,
he said.
	   Mr Chu suggested that regulators should study the practice in
North America in terms of supervision of listed companies to
enhance the future development of the Hong Kong stock market.
	   ``The SEHK should focus more on the macro risk control instead
of micro daily management such as checking English for the company
notice or announcement,'' he said.
	   He also said the mainland's A and B shares and Hong Kong's H
shares could be merged down the track.

	   THE muscles in your thighs, legs and feet act as pumps for your
veins and move blood upwards. Your veins have valves which cause
blood to flow towards your heart but not in the reverse direction.
	   Consequently, any pressure exerted by your surrounding muscles
causes blood to flow upwards. The frog posture helps improve muscle
efficiency and tone, ensuring that the pumping action of muscles is
at its optimum.
	   By improving the blood flow, we are able to release tension in
our muscles. It is worth the effort practising the frog posture
especially if you have to stand for long periods.
	   The frog posture is done in a sitting position. The knees are
placed wide apart and the tips of the big toes touch. The buttocks
are placed on the floor between the feet. The wider you spread your
thighs, the easier it will be to sit on the floor as in Figure 1.
Keep the back straight and breathe normally for two to three
minutes. If there is any discomfort in the legs or hips, come out
of the posture and repeat it after a short break.
	   The frog posture helps to elongate the thigh muscles and improve
the blood circulation to the stomach and this, in turn, helps
digestion.
	   Practice the frog posture if you suffer from leg cramps or any
problems related to poor blood circulation in the legs.

	   The Colima drug capos known as the ``Amphetamine Kings'' were
denied bail Wednesday by the 8th District Judge in Guadalajara,
Notimex reported.
	   Luis y Jose de Jesus Amezcua Contreras, who became one of
Mexico's most powerful drug cartels by running methamphetamine from
Colima to the United States, will remain in the Puente Grande
Federal Center of Social Readaptation.
	   Benjamin de Loza Cruz said that the Amezcuas request for bail
was denied because their crime was considered ``serious'' under
Mexican law.
	   The brothers are charged with tax evasion. On Tuesday, charges
of money laundering and criminal association against the Amezcuas
were dropped. Drug possession or trafficking charges were never
brought against the brother.
	   Everardo Rojas, the lawyer for the ``Amphetamine Kings,'' said
he had filed a request with the 2nd District Judge to issue an
injunction to prevent the Amezcuas extradition to the United
States.
	   The U.S. had been after the brothers for years, accusing them of
being the leading distributors of methamphetamine in the United
States.
	   Methamphetamine is the base for the drug ``speed.''
	   Both U.S. and Mexican anti-drug officials praised the arrests as
one of the highest-profile drug busts in Mexico this year.

	   IN a bid to stimulate the International Direct Dialing (IDD)
traffic volume, New T&AMP;T yesterday launched the IDD 007 Happy Hour
service offering low prices to residential customers calling seven
destinations from 6.30 pm to 9.30 pm.
	   New T&AMP;T director of marketing, Tony Cheung, said IDD traffic
volume recorded a 10 per cent drop for both residential and
corporate customers during the past three months compared with the
same period in 1997.
	   Monthly spending of residential customers on IDD, however,
remained at about $450, which is on the high side of the market, he
said.
	   New T&AMP;T hopes to boost IDD traffic with its promotional tariff
plans which would last until 31 July, Mr Cheung said.
	   All IDD 007 Value Class residential customers will benefit from
the lower rates, while those already on New T&AMP;T call plans _ such
as Cable Advantage, Personal Contacts, Most Called Country, and the

	   The Happy Hour IDD rates for these call plan customers are lower
than any offered by New T&AMP;T's major competitors, Mr Cheung said.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong police arrested 44 people early
Thursday morning suspected of illegally gambling on World Cup
soccer matches, a police statement said.
	   The statement said a 29-year-old man asked an undercover police
officer to bet on the World Cup opening game between Brazil and
Scotland in a bar Wednesday night.
	   The statement said police arrested 44 people when the man
settled the bet with the officer after the game ended, five of whom
were suspected to be bookmakers.
	   All were later released on bail of up to 10,000 Hong Kong
dollars (U.S dlrs 1,280), police said.
	   Bars in Hong Kong's red-light district of Wanchai playing live
broadcasts of World Cup matches will have their liquor licenses
revoked if gambling occurs, police warned on the late-night news
broadcast.
	   Undercover police will visit bars throughout the territory until
the World Cup ends, police added.
	   Gambling is banned in Hong Kong except on horse races and
lotteries controlled by the Jockey Club.

	   PROPERTY developer Great Eagle Holdings posted a 16.3 per cent
drop in net profits, which amounted to $616.4 million, for the six
months ending 31 March.
	   Turnover dropped 27.5 per cent to $1.4 billion from $1.9 billion
last year.
	   Interim earnings per share was $1.18 compared to last year's
$1.60.
	   The board declared an interim dividend of 15 cents per share
compared to last year's 21 cents.
	   Chairman Lo Ying-shek noted that the economy of Hong Kong had
continued to slow since the Asian currency turmoil made itself felt
in 1997.
	   And the property and stock markets had been under pressure as a
result of declining economic growth and severe tightening of bank
credit, he said.
	   Still, Mr Lo added, ``our grade A offices are still enjoying
high occupancy with rentals at healthy levels despite the current
unfavourable conditions.'' But in the year ahead, Mr Lo said,
competition would intensify with an increased supply from new
developments.
	   ``Our hotel business in Hong Kong has been suffering from the
severe decline in the tourist inflow since the second half of
1997,'' he said.
	   This had been caused mainly by the currency devaluation and poor
economic conditions of Southeast Asian countries, he said.
	   ``Our two hotels and service apartments have performed
disappointingly in the second half of 1997 and the first half of
1998.'' Mr Lo anticipated that the tourism industry would continue
to be affected adversely in the second half of 1998. But, he said,
Great Eagle believed the market had reached its low point and
expected to see ``gradual but slow recovery in the near future''.
	   Mr Lo said Great Eagle remained highly confident about the
long-term prospects of Hong Kong as the international financial
centre for China, and this boded well ``for the performance of the
prime office and hotel sectors in the long term''.
	   Great Eagle Holdings is involved in property development and
investment.

	   PROVISIONAL liquidators for Peregrine Derivatives Ltd (PDL) have
confirmed the cash balance of realised company assets for creditors
as of the end of May was $403 million, a figure twice as high as
previous estimates.
	   Speaking at a meeting of the company's creditors yesterday,
David Hague, a partner with provisional liquidator Price
Waterhouse, said the fact that Peregrine Investment Holdings was
made up of over 200 subsidiaries of which PDL was one, made the
task of liquidation extremely difficult.
	   ``Liquidating a company of this scale is unprecedented,'' he
said.
	   ``It is complex and very complicated, particularly so in the
unwinding of PDL's derivative transactions.'' He added that because
Peregrine operated across a number of international borders and due
to the absence of any cross-border liquidation laws, the process
would be made doubly difficult.
	   Stephen Caswell, also of Price Waterhouse, said PDL had $1.02
billion in assets and $2.54 billion in liabilities, a short fall of
$1.52 billion.
	   ``The biggest creditor is PDL's parent, Peregrine Holdings,'' he
said.

	   One of Mexico's greatest doctors of medicine, Dr. Salvador
Zubiran died of a heart attack Wednesday morning at his home. He
was 99.
	   The central auditorium of the National Institute For Nutrition,
founded by Zubiran in the 1940s, was adorned with white flowers in
honor of its founder. Considered one of Mexico's most famous
physicians, Zubiran headed the institute for 30 years. He also
founded the Mexican School of Medicine and was rector of the
National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).
	   Zubiran's coffin was placed at the center of the Institute's
atrium where specialists and physicians from all medical fields
were able to lay tributes to Zubiran.
	   In recognition of his work President Ernesto Zedillo (back from
the U.N. summit on drugs) and his wife, Nilda Patricia Velasco de
Zedillo initiated the funeral ceremony which was later elaborated
by UNAM Rector Francisco Barnes de Castro and Social Security
Institute General Director Genaro Borrego.
	   Zubiran leaves his wife, Maria Luisa Lopez Collada, who remained
predominately emotive and tearful throughout the ceremony but later
gave thanks for the homage paid to her husband. Zubiran's doctor
consoled his family by assuring them he died painlessly and above
all peacefully.
	   Zubiran will be cremated Thursday and his ashes will be placed
in a crypt at the ancient Santa Cruz Church in Mexico City's
Colonia Pedregal.
	   Zubiran is survived by his wife and five children: Salvador,
Martha, Yoland, Gloria and Graciela.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian recorded its first increase in
gross domestic product growth since 1989, a news agency reported
Thursday.
	   Presidential aide Anatoly Halchinsky said GDP grew by 0.1
percent in the first five months of 1998, the first increase since
1989, Interfax reported.
	   He cited figures provided by the State Statistics Committee.
	   Earlier figures have indicated a drop in GDP of 0.2 percent in
the first quarter of 1998 from the same period last year.
	   The Ukrainian economy has contracted every year since the former
Soviet republic gained independence in 1991, and it was not clear
whether the positive trend reported by Halchinsky would hold.
	   Government officials have forecast a GDP growth of at least 0.5
percent this year, but independent economists have expressed
doubts. GDP dropped by 3.2 percent last year and by 10.1 percent in
1996.

Pakistan offers nuclear testing moratorium, talks with India
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan announced a moratorium on
nuclear testing Thursday, and asked for fresh peace talks with its
rival India.
	   Relations between Pakistan and India have been tense since the
two countries conducted tit-for-tat nuclear tests last month.
	   ``The government of Pakistan has decided to announce a
unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing,'' said a statement issued
by Pakistan's foreign ministry Thursday.
	   In an interview Thursday with The Associated Press, Foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub said ``we wanted to clarify our position . . .
so there would be no confusion that we will unilaterally agree to a
moratorium on testing.''
	   Pakistan is suggesting a ``no-nuclear test'' pact with India as
the first ``confidence-building measure at the regional level.''
	   India already has agreed to a moratorium on further nuclear
tests.
	   Pakistan also said Thursday it was ready for new talks with
India about the disputed state of Kashmir, which has been the flash
point of two previous wars between Pakistan and India. The two
countries fought a third war in 1971 over Bangladesh or what was
then East Pakistan.
	   A united Kashmir was split between India and Pakistan after the
Asian subcontinent gained its independence from Britain in 1947.
	   ``Here there is an open conflict going on daily,'' Ayub said.
	   Ayub warned the international community that without a
settlement on Kashmir, there is a strong possibility of a fourth,
most probably nuclear, confrontation between India and Pakistan.
	   The U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan is to send a special envoy
to Pakistan and India to cool tempers and lay the groundwork for
his own visit to the region, said the state-run Associated Press of
Pakistan.
	   Ayub said that the United Nations as well as the G-8 nations,
who are to meet on Friday in London, have their work cut out for
them.
	   ``They have to assert themselves where they have been sleeping
in the past . . . they are like a person in a deep slumber who has
been rudely awakened,'' he said.
	   Pakistan is demanding that Kashmiris, on both the Indian and
Pakistani side of the disputed border, be allowed to vote in a
referendum on whether a united Kashmir should go to Pakistan or
India.
	   So far India has rejected a vote saying that its territory is
nonnegotiable.
	   Indian-controlled Kashmir is New Delhi's only Muslim dominated
state in a country heavily dominated by Hindus.
	   India has accused Pakistan of fomenting violence on its side of
the border, arming and training Muslim militants who have been
waging a bloody secessionist battle since 1989, demanding either
outright independence or union with Islamic Pakistan.
	   Islamabad says it gives only moral and political support to
Kashmiri militants.

	   THE government said yesterday it has set up a new port and
maritime board to help promote Hong Kong's shipping industry.
	   The Secretary for Economic Services Stephen Ip said the Hong
Kong Port and Maritime Board is an ``important initiative'' in the
government's efforts to promote shipping.
	   Mr Ip said the new board, which was set up on 1 June, would work
towards strengthening Hong Kong's position as an international
shipping hub, and to develop new shipping and related businesses in
the Special Administrative Region.
	   He added that the board would also look at ways and means of
creating more jobs in the shipping industry.
	   The board members were appointed by the Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa for two years.
	   Peter Thompson, a maritime lawyer and former chairman of the
Port Development Board, would be the chairman of the 21-member
board, which includes people well known in the Hong Kong port and
shipping community.
	   Mr Ip said the main function of the new board would be to
co-ordinate and bring together the resources of the government and
the maritime sector to promote shipping, support Hong Kong's
economic development and create new job opportunities.
	   In terms of tonnage, Hong Kong shipowners control around 6 per
cent of the merchant ships in the world.
	   The SAR ranks fifth after shipping giants, Greece, Japan, Norway
and the United States.
	   ``The main strength of Hong Kong as an international shipping
centre is that we are not only a ship-owning centre but we are also
a very important ship management centre,'' Mr Ip said.

After 145 years, girls at English private school to wear pants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHELTENHAM, England (AP) _ After 145 years of making girls wear
skirts to class, one of England's top private schools has decided
to let them wear pants.
	   Sixth-formers at Cheltenham Ladies' College _ the equivalent of
high school seniors _ will be allowed to swap their school uniform
skirts for a pair of regulation navy trousers, starting in
September.
	   The move came after college chiefs asked parents and students
their views on plans to redesign the school uniform, school
spokesman Kim Hill said Thursday.
	   ``The uniform had not changed a great deal since the war and I
think that was just because it never occurred to anybody before,''
she said. ``Tradition has a certain amount to do with it, but
everyone seems happy that the option to wear trousers should be
given to the girls.''
	   Students in the lower grades, however, still must wear their
traditional skirts and blouses.

Lonrho to sell Princess Hotels to Canadian Pacific
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The shrinking conglomerate Lonrho PLC said
Thursday it agreed to sell its Princess Hotels subsidiary to
Canadian Pacific Ltd. for dlrs 540 million as part of its strategy
to focus on mining.
	   Canadian Pacific Hotels and Resorts Inc., a unit of the Canadian
Pacific rail and shipping group, will assume dlrs 71 million in
debt as part of the deal. Lonrho will use dlrs 56 million of its
proceeds to pay back other parts of the hotel chain's debts.
	   Lonrho, a trading company with extensive interests in Africa,
spun off its non-mining assets in Africa last month into Lonrho
Africa, a separate company listed on the London Stock Exchange.
	   The deal to sell the Princess Hotels ``substantially completes
the process of focusing Lonrho on its high-quality mining
operations,'' said the company's chairman, Sir John Craven.

	   The National Council of the Maquiladora Export Industry (CNIME)
announced Wednesday a new campaign to combat what CNIME calls
misconceptions of maquiladoras. The campaign entitled the Pro Image
Crusade will incorporate the help of other organizations such as
the Environment and Commerce Secretariats to disseminate
information about a series of studies on the impact of
assembly-for-export plants along the Mexico-U.S. border known as
maquiladoras.
	   ``The truth is, the maquiladora industry has been around since
1966 and has offered a million competitive jobs in 4,000 industrial
plants on both sides of the Mexico-U.S. border,'' said Marco
Antonio Valenzuela, president of CNIME.
	   ``There are a lot of foreign interests out there backed by
political forces that continue to attack the maquiladora industry
on its supposed lack of competitiveness and human rights abuses,''
	   Valenzuela said. ``We have found that these accusations are mere
fabrications and straight-out lies.''
	   When asked to comment on who the foreign interests and political
forces are, Valenzuela declined to name names. ``I can't really say
at this time,'' Valenzuela said.
	   Other sources report that there have been significant labor
movement activities on behalf of the U.S.-based labor union AFL-CIO
in a variety of maquiladora border towns. Union organizers have
criticized the maquiladora industry on issues of minimum wage, sex
discrimination and health conditions.
	   Francisco Hernandez Juarez, president of the Mexican National
Workers Union (UNT) said, ``maquiladoras are Latin America's
lowest-paid sweatshops.''
	   The only worker advocates recognized in the maquiladoras are
government-backed union representatives, a trend that the UNT
helped break this year.
	   In defense, CNIME said that its workers receive excellent
training and manufacture products of the utmost quality at fair
international prices. Apart from labor issues, analysts also charge
the maquiladora industry with not contributing its fair share to
the balance of payments.
	   ``The problem is that there is a dramatic inequality in what we
import versus what is exported,'' said Value brokerage house
economi st Javier Reyes. ``Eighty-percent of Mexico's imported
goods are used for exportation. We're just not gaining the benefits
internally,'' Reyes said.
	   Alberto Gonzalez of Grupo Economistas Asociados also fears that
the maquiladoras have a tremendous social impact on Mexican
society.
	   ``Basically you're uprooting people from their original habitats
and forcing them to look for job opportunities and better wages in
the north of the country,'' Gonzalez said.
	   Gonzalez said the average manufacturing worker makes about 8,000
dollars per year, while a maquiladora employee makes around 10,000
dollars annually.
	   ``What we need to do is look toward opening up opportunities and
putting factories in other parts of the country,'' he said.

	   DATUK Bandar Tan Sri Kamaruzzaman Sharif has asked the Kuala
Lumpur Tourist Association to create a carnival atmospehere in the
city between Sept 11 and 21 to promote the 16th Commonwealth Games.
	   He said association (KLTA) members who were hoteliers could play
a leading role in this effort.
	   ``During the games, the city will have an influx of foreigners
and we would like everyone especially organisations such as the
KLTA, which has a lot of experience, to promote Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``Tourism is a money spinner and the KLTA should help turn Kuala
Lumpur into a major tourist destination and a shopping haven by
embarking on more aggresive campaigns,'' he said.
	   Kamaruzzaman, also the patron of the 35-year-old association,
praised KLTA member the Taxi, Hired Car and Limousing Operators
Association of West Pahang, Federal Territory and Selangor
(Perpekli) for distributing 200,000 pamphlets on the dos and don'ts
when using taxis.
	   Perpekli president Aslah Abdullah said public response has been
encouraging towards taxi use after the launching of the pamphlets
by Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Mustapa Mohamed in
March.
	   Kamaruzzaman had earlier received new KLTA executive committee
members led by its new chairman Jamaliah Aris who called on him at
his office in Jalan Raja Laut. They were elected during the KLTA
annual meeting on April 29.
	   Jamaliah said KLTA would be participating in several programmes
this year including the KLTA Vision Four Florathon '98 on June 28,
Floral Parade on July 5, and Florex '98 - Floriculture Exhibition
between July 9 and 12.
	   She said the KLTA Vision Four Florathon '98 would be flagged off
at the Dataran Merdeka at 7.30am and was open to the public.
	   ``It will involve a two-km walk along Dataran Merdeka and the
Lake Gardens in your best floral togs and merit is given to
flower-power and not speed.
	   ``Participants from all ages can expect to walk away with
fabulous prizes.
	   ``The theme is Games &AMP; Pastimes and participation fee for both
the national and international categories are: individual (adult) -
RM12; children below 12 - RM6; family (maximum of five) - RM50;
senior citizen - RM6; and company - RM100,'' she said.
	   Jamaliah said last year's event attracted 800 participants
including foreign tourists.
	   She said KLTA would also be participating in the Floral Parade
this year, to be held between 8am and 10am on July 5 at te Dataran
Merdeka.
	   She said KLTA would also be organising a four-day Florex '98 -
Floriculture Exhibition at the Amcorp Mall in Petaling Jaya from
July 9.
	   She said it was a significant and important flower exposition
which would be an excellent platform for exhibitors in the
floriculture and horticulture industries to promote their products
and services.
	   Visitors to the exhibition will be able to view flowers, greens,
landscaping services, floriculture equipment, floral accessories,
tissue cultures, green/glass houses, bonsai and publications.
	   For details on Florathon '98, call Kay or Roslin at 03-284 2788

<SLUG> Gucci earnings down amid takeover talk </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italy's chic leathergoods firm, Gucci, said
Thursday its net income in the first quarter of 1998 fell to dlrs
43.1 million from dlrs 48 million in the same period last year.
	   It said revenues fell to dlrs 250.7 million from dlrs 254.3
million.
	   The results come amid rumors that the Prada fashion house, which
announced last weekend it had acquired a 5 percent stake in Gucci,
might be planning a takeover.
	   In an interview with newspaper Il Messagero this week, Gucci
chief executive officer Domenico De Sole suggested that Prada
doesn't have the money for a takeover. Prada has yet to say what
its plans are.
	   Gucci said sales in the United States in the first quarter
inched down to dlrs 74.1 million from dlrs 75.6 million, while
sales in Europe rose to dlrs 68.2 million from dlrs 55.2 million.
	   Sales in Asia fell to dlrs 99.6 million from dlrs 118.8 million
while sales in the rest of the world rose to dlrs 8.8 million from
dlrs 4.7 million.

ETA's longest hostage was rescued four days before he planned to
</HEADLINE>
kill himself &QL; 
 &UR; By MAR ROMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A former prison officer who was held
hostage for 18 months by the Basque separatist group ETA, testified
Thursday that he was planning suicide when he was rescued.
	   In a written statement read during the second and last day of
the National Court trial for ETA's longest kidnapping, Jose Antonio
Ortega Lara said he had given up hope and decided to hang himself
or cut his wrists on July 5 last year.
	   But with four days to go before his personal deadline, the
39-year-old prison officer was rescued from the 3-meter by
2.5-meter (9-foot by 7-foot) windowless room where he had been
hidden throughout his captivity.
	   The ETA kidnapped Ortega Lara on January 7 1996, conditioning
his release on improved conditions for 450 jailed members of the
group. A year and a half later police tracked down his four captors
and discovered the hideout located in the northern city of
Mondragon.
	   On the opening day of the trial the four defendants admitted to
keeping Ortega Lara hostage but denied conspiring to murder him.
They could face up to 32 years in prison if convicted on both
counts.
	   Ortega Lara himself was excused from appearing in court after a
medical evaluation concluded this could further damage his already
delicate psychological condition.
	   In his statement, the ETA's longest ever hostage recounted that
the four accused had told him he had been targeted because he was a
prison officer and an activist within the governing Popular Party.
	   Since beginning its campaign for an independent Basque state in
1968, the ETA has kidnapped 71 people, most of them Basque
businessmen, to raise funds for its operations.
	   Ortega Lara also said his captors told him that the Popular
Party's leader, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, and Spanish King
Juan Carlos were the group's main targets.
	   The ETA has attempted to assassinate the King on several
occasions, and in 1995 then opposition leader Aznar emerged unhurt
from a car-bomb attack.
	   The group _ whose name is a Basque language acronym for Basque
Homeland and Freedom _ has killed nearly 800 people.
	   Also Thursday, the three-judge panel heard the testimonies of
the police officers who rescued Ortega Lara and the doctors who
examined him immediately afterwards.
	   One police agent described the frail and bewildered prison
official as a ``live corpse'' when they found him. The doctors said
he had not eaten properly for fear of being poisoned.
	   With the hearing over, a verdict is expected within a few
months.

	   BARISAN Nasional backbencher Hilmi Rashid (BN-Bertam) yesterday
criticised the local authority for approving the establishment of
an entertainment outlet between two secondary schools in Kepala
Batas.
	   Hilmi said he learnt that the authority had allowed the outlet a
permit to operate between Sekolah Menengah Datuk Abdul Kader and
Sekolah Menengah Datuk Ahmad Badawi.
	   ``I will go there (entertainment outlet) and find out which
officer approved and signed the licence.
	   ``The office should be more sensitive, especially when approving
such entertainment outlets in areas where schools are located,'' he
said when debating the Bill on Entertainment and Places of
Entertainment Enactment 1997.
	   Jasmin Mohamed (BN-Sungai Dua) said the authorities should stop
approving permits for such outlets in small towns and rural
districts.
	   ``I am sure tourists will not patronise outlets in such areas so
why allow them a permit in the first place?'' he said.

Bold Scottish supporters brighten up Paris
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Scottish supporters in town for the World Cup have
added a new dimension to French cultural life, showing incredulous
Parisians that Scotsmen really are naked under their kilts.
	   Members of the Tartan Army, in Paris to support their soccer
team, are not only drinking, singing and playing the bagpipe, but
many of them are also lifting their skirts and risk being charged
with indecent exposure.
	   ``We have been notified by police reports that some Scottish
supporters were, on Tuesday night, lifting their kilts and
revealing themselves naked,'' said the Paris prosecutors' office
Thursday. ``But since no complaints have been made nor fines given,
we are not planning on pursuing the matter.''
	   Therese, a Parisian legal secretary, who witnessed one of the
numerous incidents during the World Cup kick-off parade Tuesday,
said the revealing moment happened accidentally.
	   ``It wasn't vulgar or crude,'' she said, describing the moment
when the wind caught the Scotsmens' kilts while they were standing
above a subway air vent on the Champs Elysees.
	   The Scotsmen were taken by surprise, much to the amusement of
by-standers.
	   ``It all happened in a great friendly spirit,'' Therese added,
giggling. She did not want her last name used.
	   Some people, such as U.S. tourist Lori Anglin, were just pleased
to see that the legend was true.
	   Having spotted yet another of the Tartan Army's revealing
exercises on a bridge near the Eiffel Tower, Anglin said: ``It's
true what they've always said about Scots - they have nothing under
their kilt. Even on a blustery day they're truly the
brave-hearted.''

	   THE State Government may seek to list on the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange the company which will take over the operations of the
Penang Water Authority once it is corporatised.
	   Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu Koon (BN-Tanjung Bunga) said
there was a possibility that PWA's successor company would be
listed on the KLSE, subject to its performance and the country's
economic recovery.
	   ``The option to list, however, is not a priority since the
company should focus on ensuring quality water supply and providing
superior service to consumers,'' he said when replying to points
raised on the Penang Water Authority (Successor Company) Enactment
1998.
	   Koh said if the successor company was to be listed, the State
Government would be the majority shareholder.
	   He also said that issues such water rates would be determined by
the State Government and not the company.
	   He said although the PWA had chalked profits totalling RM208
million between 1993 and 1997, the authority had incurred capital
expenditures totalling RM291 million during the corresponding
period.
	   Seberang Jaya Assemblyman Datuk Abdul Latiff Mirasa said the
State Government should ensure the soon-to-be corporatised
authority did not increase water rates, but instead, take the lead
to reduce rates.
	   ``Water rates can be reduced through efficient management,'' he
added, saying that the welfare of the PWA employees should also be
a priority in the corporatisation exercise.
	   Meanwhile when debating the Water Supply Enactment 1998,
backbencher Syed Ameruddin Syed Ahmad (BN-Teluk Kumbar) asked whose
responsibility it was to ensure that water catchment areas were
protected.
	   Syed Ameruddin and sole Opposition member Chong Eng (DAP-Batu
Lanchang) said although there were already existing laws to protect
the State's water resources and supply, enforcement was lacking.
	   Bayan Lepas assemblyman Lim Chien Aun also proposed an ``amnesty
period''
	   for users of wells in the State once all water catchment areas
were gazetted.

World Cup: Danes confident of winning start against Saudi Arabia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Denmark may have lost all three of its
warmup matches, but its players expect three points Friday from
their first real World Cup outing, against Saudi Arabia.
	   ``We all feel 110 percent convinced that we will live up to the
playing style which we showed in the World Cup qualification
games,'' striker Brian Laudrup said. ``We must, and will, win
Friday's opening game against the Saudis.''
	   ``A win over Saudi Arabia will give a kick to our
self-confidence,'' Laudrup said. ``We need that after our poor
recent showings.''
	   Denmark lost World Cup warmup games 2-0 against Sweden and
Norway and 2-1 against Cameroon.
	   ``I don't expect a 'goal-rich' World Cup match in Lens,''
defender Jes Hoegh said. ``We'll get a narrow 1-0 win or maybe a
2-0. We are well-prepared. We're having a good time here.''
	   Denmark and Saudi Arabia both are making their second
appearances in the World Cup finals.
	   The countries reached the last 16 in their previous visits to
the finals, Denmark in 1986 and Saudi Arabia in 1994.
	   The teams have met once before, in 1995, and Denmark won 2-0.
	   Denmark hasn't announced its lineup, but Brondby's Ebbe Sand,
top scorer in the Danish league last season with 28 goals, looks
likely to partner star striker Laudrup.
	   Sand's only previous appearance for Denmark was in the recent
defeat by Norway.
	   Sand is similar in style to Preben Elkjaer-Larsen, the powerful
striker who scored 38 times in 69 matches for Denmark during the
1980s.
	   Saudi Arabia manager Carlos Alberto Parreira, leading his record
fourth different country at the World Cup, is expecting a tough
encounter.
	   ``The Danes play all of their (soccer) in Europe, so they have
the upper hand,'' Parreira said. ``Saudi Arabia plays in Asia so
they lack experience at the top level.''
	   Parriera, who coached Brazil to the world title four years ago,
said the Danes' biggest advantage is their physical presence,
adding that much of his team's training has centered on improving
its strength.

Carlos Moya latest upset victim at Gerry Weber Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALLE, Germany (AP) _ French Open Carlos Moya Thursday became
the latest upset victim at the Gerry Weber Open when the Spaniard
was ousted in straight sets by Germany's Hendrik Dreekmann.
	   Dreekman served 10 double faults, but attacked the net at every
chance to roll past the Spaniard 7-5, 6-3 and reach the
quarterfinals at the dlrs 875,000 tuneup for Wimbledon.
	   ``My serve wasn't exactly good, but I had a little luck today.
There were a few key points and I won them,'' said Dreekmann.
	   Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the defending champion, advanced
with a 6-4, 6-3 victory over Germany's David Prinosil, but had to
rally to avoid the upset trend. In the first two rounds, five seeds
have been ousted, including No. 1 Petr Korda.
	   Prinosil broke Kafelnikov's serve early in both sets, but let
4-1 and 3-0 leads slip away as his errors mounted. The second-seed
then swept to victory in just 54 minutes when the German crashed a
volley into the net.
	   Sweden's Magnus Norman also reached the quarterfinals by
struggling past Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands, 6-4, 5-7, 6-3.
	   Dreekmann, who has slumped from the world No. 36 to 101, needed
an hour, 27 minute to make Moya his second big-name victim at the
event. He also handed compatriot Boris Becker a first-round loss.
	   The 23-year-old drew cheers from the German crowd by slamming
some pinpoint returns and constantly gambling at the net against
Moya, struggling to adjust to grass after winning Roland Garros two
weeks ago.
	   ``Today it was nice to enjoy the full support of the
spectators,'' said Dreekmann. ``On Tuesday, they clearly wanted
Becker to win.''
	   Becker's popularity is so vital to the tournament that Karsten
Braasch Wednesday accused the referees of favoring the German star
in a doubles match.
	   Braasch and Jens Knippschild lost an all-German doubles match to
Becker and Prinosil after winning the first set.
	   Braasch objected to a call against his team that prevented a
break for a decisive 5-3 second-set lead.
	   ``That was an effrontery what happened on the court,'' Braasch
said. ``It can't be that things like that happen just to keep a
certain player in the tournament.''
	   Braasch apologized Thursday, while the ATP refused to comment on
that matter.

Police kill two dozen Maoists rebels in Nepal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Nepalese police have killed at least 24
Maoist rebels in an operation to flush them from jungle hide-outs
in the past 10 days, an official said Thursday.
	   One police constable also was killed in a gunbattle with the
rebels in western Nepal, which has been hit by the Maoist
insurgency for the past two years, a police officer said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The rebels want Nepal, a constitutional monarchy, to be
transformed into a republic.
	   Nearly 1,500 police officers are targeting the three hardest-hit
districts _ Rukum, Rolpa and Jajarkot. The area is located 320
kilometers (200 miles) west of Katmandu, the Nepalese capital.
	   The government didn't confirm the police crackdown. But
officials said nearly 150 people, including civilians and security
personnel, have been killed by the rebels in the past two years.

	   THE House yesterday passed the Entertainment and Places of
Entertainment Enactment 1997 which provides for the licensing and
regulation of entertainment and places of public entertainment in
the State.
	   With the implementation of the Bill, the Theatres and Places of
Public Amusement Enactment 1958 will cease to be in force.
	   In tabling the Bill, Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu Koon
(BN-Tanjung Bunga) said although the basic features of the existing
Enactment were retained in the Bill, it however sought to define in
greater detail the activities to be controlled.
	   ``It also seeks to provide for heavier penalties for offences
committed under the proposed Enactment.''
	   Koh said the existing enactment was enforced since December 1958
although ``the form of entertainment and entertainment places had
since changed and involve a much wider scope.'' Also, he said,
places of entertainment for the public had increased.
	   ``Which is why it is necessary to control and enforce such
activities.
	   Furthermore, entertainment outlets have been identified as one
of the sources of social ills,'' he said.
	   Koh said the new Bill would seek to confer upon authorised
officers powers of enforcement which, under the existing Enactment,
were only conferred on police officers.
	   It however contains provisions for the exemption of action
against entertainment held for religious, educational,
recreational, social, welfare, and charitable purposes.

Pro-Israeli militiaman killed, another wounded in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas shot an anti-tank missile
at a vehicle carrying members of an Israeli-allied militia
Thursday, killing one militiaman and wounding another, security
officials said.
	   The vehicle of the South Lebanon Army militia was hit by a
Sagger missile as it was traveling on a mountain road near the
Christian town of Jezzine, the Lebanese officials said.
	   One militiaman was killed instantly and another was moderately
wounded in the attack, the officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Jezzine, which is controlled by the militia, is 20 kilometers
(12.5 miles) north of Marjayoun, the main town in an
Israeli-occupied border enclave in south Lebanon.
	   Militia officials confirmed the two casualties, but declined to
give their names or ranks. The 2,500-strong militia is funded,
trained and equipped by Israel.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
	   The pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, had in the past
targeted Israeli troops and their allied militiamen with missiles
and roadside bombs as part of a war of attrition to oust them from
the occupied zone.
	   Israel has controlled the zone, about 10 percent of Lebanese
territory, since 1985 to guard its northern towns from cross-border
attacks.

Nigerian opposition, new military boss head toward clash

challenge. UPDATES with new quotes from opposition leader and
raises explanation of disenchantment with Abacha's democratic
reforms. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ His nascent leadership just days old,
Nigeria's new military leader faces his first challenge from a
vocal and ubiquitous opposition defiantly calling for a mass
demonstration and a nationwide strike Friday.
	   Critics were watching to see _ if the strike and protest take
place _ whether Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar would show uncommon
tolerance, or crush his opponents, in keeping with an all too
common precedent set by his heavy-handed predecessor, the late Gen.
Sani Abacha.
	   Local military chiefs in the commercial capital of Lagos have
already hinted they would use force if pro-democracy activists push
forward to rally the masses.
	   ``Such demonstrations are unnecessary at this point in time,''
said Lagos military administrator Col. Mohammed Marwa. ``This is a
time for prayers.''
	   The protest originally aimed to mark the annulment of June 12,
1993, presidential elections _ which had they gone forward would
have ended military rule. However, the demonstration call has taken
on added significance, coming just three days after Abubakar became
this West African nation's latest military ruler.
	   Marwa refused to grant demonstration permits Thursday and
ominously warned government opponents to ``avoid any situation that
would invite the use of force.''
	   Almost immediately, Abubakar angered opposition groups by
offering only a vague pledge to move forward with Abacha's flawed
democratic reform program.
	   Abacha promised to hand power over to civilians, but then
manipulated the process to become the only candidate for president.
His military regime vetted all political parties and reserved the
right to disqualify candidates in legislative and gubernatorial
polls.
	   Abubakar has said nothing that sets apart his pledge to continue
the government transition process from that of Abacha, who died of
a heart attack on Monday.
	   Moreover, Abubakar _ within hours of taking power _ appeared to
be moving swiftly to consolidate power and eliminate potential
rivals.
	   Two members of his inner circle were under house arrest in the
capital of Abuja, two sources told The Associated Press.
	   Government critics who want to push Abubakar and the army out of
power say they will challenge the new leader's mandate in the
courts and on the streets.
	   Gani Fawehinmi, a Lagos attorney and one of the country's
best-known opposition activists, said he would file a suit in the
Nigerian high court against Abubakar. Fawehinmi said there was
nothing in Nigerian law that says a chief of defense staff succeeds
the head of state in Africa's most populous nation.
	   Insisting Friday's planned protests will go forward, Fawehinmi
said opponents of military rule would defy the local authorities.
	   ``We do not need a permit to exercise our fundamental rights,''
he said in an interview Thursday. ``We have a right to demonstrate
peacefully. We have a right to express our own views.''
	   Fawehinmi has led the call for demonstrations in Lagos planned
for Friday. The day marks the fifth anniversary of annulled
presidential elections reportedly won by Moshood Abiola, a
billionaire businessman now in prison on treason charges.
	   The group also called on Nigerians to observe a nationwide
24-hour strike and urged them not to recognize Abubakar's
government.
	   It was not clear just how many people would heed the strike call
or join the protest rallies. Fear of Nigeria's brutal security
forces run deep, as does apathy in a population accustomed to being
ignored and trod upon.
	   Still, with Nigeria's economy in ruins despite its vast oil
reserves, there was much to protest.
	   Little in Nigeria functions these days, from the water supply to
the telephones. The only people who have a comfortable life are
those who can afford to buy generators, truck in their own water
and hire security guards to fend off rampant robbers.

	   KUALA Lumpur City Hall can divert the RM100 million allocated
annually for cleaning of clogged drains and polluted rivers to
development if the public is more civic-conscious and takes care of
waterways.
	   Datuk Bandar Tan Sri Kamaruzzaman Shariff said the public should
change its attitude and care for the city.
	   He said City Hall would launch its ``Care for your Rivers and
Drains''
	   campaign in August in conjunction with the 1998 Commonwealth
Games the following month.
	   Kamaruzzaman hoped the campaign would help instil a love for
rivers among the people.
	   He was speaking to reporters after receiving a cheque for
RM57,500 from Esso at the Kuala Lumpur Memorial Library.
	   Three libraries in Jalan Jelatek, Desa Tun Razak and Gombak will
receive RM52,500, with the balance going to City Hall to help
design and produce multimedia software on CD-ROM.
	   ``The authorities spend a lot of money cleaning drains and
rivers. We are doing our best to keep the city clean. But the
public will have to play its part as well.
	   ``The people will have to change their attitude and play their
part as responsible citizens.''
	   He added that it was vital for Kuala Lumpur to project a clean
image to visitors attending the Commonwealth Games.
	   Asked about recent flash floods at Jalan Silang, he said this
was due to a clogged drain.
	   Kamaruzzaman said it was not only the responsibility of City
Hall and Alam Flora to pick up rubbish.
	   ``The drains and rivers have become a rubbish dump for the
public. We have tried to do everything and spent a lot of money
annually but the public still insists on throwing rubbish into
drains.
	   ``There was an incident in Pantai Dalam where the contractor
dumped construction debris into the drain. When the authorities
cleaned the drain, they found a big container and rubbish from the
construction site.''
	   Kamaruzzaman added that anyone found polluting rivers and drains
would be prosecuted.
	   Meanwhile, he said the relocation of traders and hawkers from
the Chow Kit wet market to the temporary market in Jalan Ipoh was
still on.
	   He said the traders and hawkers will be relocated after the 1998
Commonwealth Games.
	   City Hall is still discussing the method of relocating the
traders.

	   THE State Government should ensure that water rates will not be
increased at least for the first three years following the
corporatisation of the Penang Water Authority.
	   Dr Teng Hock Nan (BN-Kebun Bunga) said even if the rates were to
be increased eventually, the PWA must ensure that it is increased
for the business sector and not for householders.
	   ``I asked for three years because the current economic situation
is expected to take three years to recover,'' he said.
	   Dr Teng was debating the Penang Water Authority (Successor
Company) Enactment 1998 and Water Supply Enactment 1998 Bills.
	   He urged the State Government to ensure the water supply was
clean and not contaminated.
	   Tan Cheng Liang (BN-Jawi) also urged the State Government to
ensure water rates were not raised after corporatisation as the PWA
had enough money.
	   She also called for a map to be made of all underground pipes.
	   ``By having such an underground pipe mapping, utility workers
carrying out diggings will be able to avoid damaging undergroud
pipes and disrupt the water supply,''.

	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas shot an anti-tank missile
at a vehicle carrying members of an Israeli-allied militia
Thursday, killing one militiaman and wounding another, security
officials said.
	   The vehicle of the South Lebanon Army militia was hit by a
Sagger missile as it was traveling on a mountain road near the
Christian town of Jezzine, the Lebanese officials said.
	   One militiaman was killed instantly and another was moderately
wounded in the attack, the officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Jezzine, which is controlled by the militia, is 20 kilometers
(12.5 miles) north of Marjayoun, the main town in an
Israeli-occupied border enclave in south Lebanon.
	   Militia officials confirmed the two casualties, but declined to
give their names or ranks. The 2,500-strong militia is funded,
trained and equipped by Israel.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
	   The pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, had in the past
targeted Israeli troops and their allied militiamen with missiles
and roadside bombs as part of a war of attrition to oust them from
the occupied zone.
	   Israel has controlled the zone, about 10 percent of Lebanese
territory, since 1985 to guard its northern towns from cross-border
attacks.

	   THE State Legislative Assembly yesterday passed two Bills
allowing for the corporatisation of the Penang Water Authority and
the creation of a successor company.
	   With the passing of the Water Supply Enactment 1998 and the
Penang Water Authority (Successor Company) Enactment 1998, a fully
State-owned company will take over the management and supply of
water in the State once the Bills are gazetted.
	   The Bills also call for the creation of a regulatory authority
and the post of Water Supply director, give power to the State to
declare any area as a water catchment area and increase penalties
for offences such as tampering with meters or diverting rivers.
	   The Bills were approved after a day of debate with every
assemblyman who urged against raising water rates following
corporatisation. They wanted an improvement in service and an
assurance there would be no abuse of power or high-handedness,
especially since penalties were high.
	   The Water Supply Enactment seeks to make provisions for the
supply of water in the State and the Penang Water Authority
(Successor Company) Enactment 1998 provides for the vesting of
property, rights and liabilities of the PWA in a company to be
formed.
	   In tabling the Bills, Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu Koon
(BN-Tanjung Bunga) said corporatisation would enhance the
efficiency of the water authority's operation in two aspects: ``The
first is its financial management and the other being its handling
of provisions relating to staff.''
	   He said the Water Supply Enactment 1998 conferred power on the
State to expressly declare any area to be a catchment area and the
types of activities which may be permitted in such areas. He said
the State Government did not now have ``express power'' to declare
any area a catchment area and therefore effectively act against
those damaging such areas.
	   ``The State authorities will also be empowered to make
regulations to prevent pollution, contamination or siltation of
catchment areas.''
	   Koh said the existing penalties for offences were unrealistic
and the Bill sought to increase them. For instance, anyone damaging
the water supply system or diverting rivers will be liable to a
fine not exceeding RM50,000 or a jail term of not more than two
years or both.
	   ``Water is an expensive commodity especially in Penang where the
source of supply is limited and needs to be protected from whatever
implications that can disrupts water supply.''

World Cup: A spectator in '94, Keller starts now
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos XLF102-104 &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France (AP) _ Kasey Keller says he has no
idea why he become a goalkeeper.
	   Really.
	   ``On many occasions, I've asked myself the same question,'' the
U.S. starter said Thursday, peering through his metal-frame
glasses. ``It's a stupid position. I don't know why anybody would.
I like being a goalkeeper in training, and I like being a
goalkeeper when the referee blows the whistle for the end of the
game.
	   ``It's not because you have to dive at people's feet and they
can kick you in the face. But the mistakes you make are so
apparent. You can be a virtual spectator for most of the game, and
then it's all you. You have to be pumped up for the entire 90
minutes without going through all the physical attributes.''
	   Four years ago, Keller was a spectator at the World Cup, sitting
in the stands at the Rose Bowl, dropped from the U.S. team without
so much as a tryout.
	   When the Americans open against Germany on Monday, he'll be the
most highly regarded player in the American lineup, a starter in
England's Premier League, one of the top goalkeepers in the world.
He comes in with four straight shutouts in warmup games.
	   So, excuse him if he looks back and feels vindicated.
	   ``Very much so,'' he said. ``I felt vindicated from the '96
Olympics, captaining the team.''
	   Keller, 28, was the backup to Tony Meola at the 1990 World Cup
after his last season at the University of Portland. He then went
to Europe, played for Millwall in England's top minor league from
1990-96 and spent the last two seasons as the starter for Leicester
City in the Premier League.
	   Given all his experience, Keller expected to get at least a look
from Bora Milutinovic, the U.S coach from 1991-95. But he played
just once under Milutinovic, a 1-0 loss to Scotland in 1992. Tony
Meola remained as the No. 1 keeper and Brad Friedel, the starter at
the '92 Olympics, became No. 2.
	   ``Every time I spoke to Bora, he was very polite,'' Keller said.
``He always said, `I know what you're doing in Europe. I need to
see the other guys play. You'll get your chance.' ''
	   Milutinovic never called.
	   ``That was hard to swallow,'' Keller said. ``The chance never
came.''
	   As soon as Steve Sampson replaced Milutinovic, he brought back
Keller, who responded with a 4-0 shutout of Mexico and a 3-0
victory over Argentina in the South American championship.
	   Ever since then, he and Friedel have done most of the
goalkeeping with Juergen Sommer as No. 3. Keller made five great
stops against Romario in February's 1-0 upset of Brazil, prompting
Sampson to proclaim him his No. 1 goalkeeper.
	   ``As far as his ability to block shots and to intercept crosses
and command the penalty area from a goalkeeper's standpoint, I
think he's one of the best in the world,'' Sampson said. ``And I
think he'll show that in the World Cup. He has tremendous composure
and confidence. His demeanor exudes confidence.''
	   Keller, who was born in Olympia, Wash., and grew up on an egg
farm in Lacey, became a goalkeeper when he was 13 or 14. Two years
earlier, he started wearing glasses.
	   These days, he uses contacts during the game to correct his
nearsightedness. His vision and his play was perfect in the victory
over Brazil on Feb. 10. He stopped Romario twice 1-on-1. Romario,
the 1994 World Cup MVP, was quoted as saying: ``That was the
greatest performance I've ever seen by a goalkeeper. It was an
honor to be on the field with him.''
	   ``Games like that Brazil game, they don't happen all the time,''
Keller said. ``Games where the goalkeeper makes the difference in
the result don't happen very often. Most of the time, you'll have a
goalkeeper who keeps the score to 2, 3-nil instead of 8-nil in a
game like that.''
	   Defenders feel confident with him behind them. They know he
covers for their mistakes most of the time.
	   ``He takes a goal as a personal insult,'' team captain Thomas
Dooley said.

	   TWENTY-EIGHT students from the Institute of Advertising
Communication Training completed their BA Communication degree
majoring in advertising at Charles Sturt University, Australia's
current University of the Year.
	   Under the twinning arrangement between CSU and IACT, diploma
holders from IACT have to complete one year at CSU to gain a
degree.
	   ``It is very hard to find a job in Malaysia,'' said Josephine
Wong, one successful student. ``Everyone advises us to study in
Australia for a year.
	   You return with a better chance to work with an international
company.''
	   According to CSU lecturer Brett Van Heekeren, the close industry
ties in Australia, established through work experience internships,
a guest speaker programme and relevant training, give students a
professional edge when they go home.
	   ``Here they work on real projects with real clients,'' he said.
``They're working with cutting-edge digital technology in radio,
television and print. So it's a total hands-on practical approach
to advertising.''
	   Van Heekeren knew one graduate who went straight into the post
of creative director, earning more than RM70,000 a year, another
who got a job in Saachi &AMP; Saachi, and one who became brand manager
for Polaroid.
	   Dr Peter Hodgson, CSU pro vice-chancellor, does not believe the
cultural advantages of studying in another country should be
confined to Malaysian students.
	   ``It's not a one-way street,'' he said. ``I also want more of
our Australian students to finish their degrees in Malaysia. We
have already had a number of Australian students spend a semester
or two at IACT, and the more who do that the better.''

Report: Companies raided for bid-rigging on dioxin gauging
</HEADLINE>
contracts &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Fair Trade Commission on Thursday raided
more than 20 companies suspected of rigging bids for contracts to
build new systems to measure dioxins, a news report said.
	   The companies, which include Mitsubishi Materials Corp. and
Toray Research Center Inc., were members of the Health Ministry's
Waste Research Foundation set up to improve technology to gauge
dioxin levels, Kyodo News reported.
	   The ministry asked local governments in 1990 to work with the
companies, and they are suspected of using their membership with
the foundation to fix prices and shut out competition, Kyodo said.
	   Dioxins are toxic chemical compounds produced when waste is
burned. Dioxin measurement in Japan costs three to five times more
in Japan than it does in the United States, Kyodo said.
	   Bid-rigging, known as ``dango,'' is reputedly rife in Japanese
industry. The United States has accused Japanese companies of using
the practice to block U.S. construction firms from competing in
Japan.

	   ADIGRAT, Ethiopia (AP) _ Eritrean aircraft on Thursday dropped
eight bombs on this northeastern Ethiopian border town, killing at
least one person, injuring three and setting grain warehouses
ablaze, witnesses said.
	   The first two bombs were dropped from a helicopter at 5:20 p.m.
(1420gmt) near an army base, but they apparently failed to hit
anything.
	   Jet fighters dropped four on the mountains surrounding the town,
and two on the combined industrial-residential area where the
warehouses are located in the town of some 40,000 inhabitants.
	   The attack occcured on the same day both Ethiopia and Eritrea
said fighting had broken out on the border near Eritrea's Red Sea
port of Assab.
	   Since May 6, the two countries in the Horn of Africa have been
fighting for control of territory along at least four different
points on their common border.
	   Adigrat is 125 kilometers (78 miles) south of the Eritrean
capital, Asmara and about 25 kilometers (15 miles) south of the
border.

Pro-Israeli militiaman killed, another wounded in south Lebanon

	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas shot an anti-tank missile
at a vehicle carrying members of an Israeli-allied militia
Thursday, killing one militiaman and wounding another, security
officials said.
	   The vehicle of the South Lebanon Army militia was hit by a
Sagger missile as it was traveling on a mountain road near the
Christian town of Jezzine, the Lebanese officials said.
	   One militiaman was killed instantly and another was moderately
wounded in the attack, the officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Jezzine, which is controlled by the militia, is 20 kilometers
(13 miles) north of Marjayoun, the main town in an Israeli-occupied
border enclave in south Lebanon.
	   Militia officials confirmed the two casualties, but declined to
give their names or ranks. The 2,500-strong militia is funded,
trained and equipped by Israel.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
	   The pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, has in the past
targeted Israeli troops and their allied militiamen with missiles
and roadside bombs as part of a war of attrition to oust them from
the occupied zone.
	   Israel has controlled the zone, about 10 percent of Lebanese
territory, since 1985 to guard its northern towns from cross-border
attacks.

Gucci earnings down amid takeover talk

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore slug

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italy's chic leathergoods firm, Gucci, said
Thursday its net income in the first quarter of 1998 fell to dlrs
43.1 million from dlrs 48 million in the same period last year.
	   It said revenues fell to dlrs 250.7 million from dlrs 254.3
million.
	   The results come amid rumors that the Prada fashion house, which
announced last weekend it had acquired a 5 percent stake in Gucci,
might be planning a takeover.
	   In an interview with newspaper Il Messagero this week, Gucci
chief executive officer Domenico De Sole suggested that Prada
doesn't have the money for a takeover. Prada has yet to say what
its plans are.
	   Gucci said sales in the United States in the first quarter
inched down to dlrs 74.1 million from dlrs 75.6 million, while
sales in Europe rose to dlrs 68.2 million from dlrs 55.2 million.
	   Sales in Asia fell to dlrs 99.6 million from dlrs 118.8 million
while sales in the rest of the world rose to dlrs 8.8 million from
dlrs 4.7 million.

	   THIRTEEN years after completion, the UMW Group decided that the
Shah Alam Municipal Council would be a better guardian of the clock
tower whih the group built in 1985.
	   At a special handover ceremony recently, UMW Group managing
director Wan Salleh Mohamad said the clock tower was built in
conjunction with Sultan of Selangor Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz
Shah's 25 years of successful administration.
	   ``Apart from commemorating the Sultan's 25 years in office ,the
tower is also a contribution from us to the people of Shah Alam,''
Wan Salleh said.
	   He said the clock tower had 25 steps signifying 25 years of the
Sultan's reign and the three main pillars holding the clock and the
State symbolises the three major races in Malaysia.
	   He added that it was decided that the clock tower should be
surrendered to the local council for better care and maintenance.
	   Asked why UMW Group did not continue to maintain the clock
tower, Wan Salleh said as a corporate member of the society, the
UMW Group wanted to remain in the background.
	   ``We don't even want people to know that it is from us because
it is not our intention to seek publicity through contributions.''
	   Present to receive the model clock tower from Wan Salleh was
MPSA president Mohammad Adzib Mohd Isa.
	   The clock tower is located at Section 15 roundabout and was
contructed at a cost of RM500,000. It sits on Government land.
	   The UMW Group is RM3 million company and is among the foremost
corporations listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange.
	   It has assets in excess of RM578 million and has a workforce of
more than 6,000.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ More than 3,000 people Thursday jammed
the harbor in the capital of Guinea-Bissau hoping to catch ships
out of the West African nation before government forces moved to
crush a rebellion led by renegade soldiers, according to news
reports.
	   Over 1,000 foreigners jostled with locals for a place on a
Portuguese merchant ship that was to evacuate people to Dakar in
neighboring Senegal, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported from
the small coastal country.
	   The ship, that docked in Bissau early Thursday, reportedly had
capacity for just 1,500 people.
	   A Chinese merchant ship evacuated 53 Russians and other
nationals from the former Soviet Union, including 29 embassy staff
and their families, the Interfax news agency reported, citing a
Russian Foreign Ministry official.
	   Seven planes, three from the U.S. and two each from France and
Portugal, were on standby in Dakar to take the evacuees, Lusa said.
	   Telephone contact with officials in Guinea-Bissau was not
immediately possible. Officials in Lisbon said they had no details
of how the evacuation was proceeding.
	   Senegal closed its southern border with Guinea-Bissau, Lusa
reported, though no reason was given for the move.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Control of the border
with Haiti has become one of the top priorities in the Dominican
Republic for U.S. officials, who say drug traffickers are crossing
the line too easily.
	   U.S. and Dominican anti-drug agencies estimate that between 10
percent and 15 percent of the cocaine that enters the United States
crosses the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, the
two nations that share the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.
	   Control of the border was on the agenda when U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Dominican President Leonel Fernandez met Wednesday in
Washington. The two countries agreed to joint anti-drug operations
on the border.
	   Clinton said the United States would contribute land, air and
sea forces to the effort, and Fernandez said the Dominican armed
forces would increase their presence on the border.
	   The Dominican press also reported that the United States agreed
to help the Dominican Republic with the costs of absorbing the
thousands of Dominicans who could be deported by the United States
under the new immigration laws.
	   ``We let President Clinton know that this is a very high number
(of repatriations) and that we are not prepared and we need
assistance in reintegrating them into Dominican society,''
Fernandez said after his meeting at the White House.

	   IN conjunction with the King's birthday celebration on June 6,
the Shangri-La Hotel Kuala Lumpur presented a whopping 250kg
birthday cake to the King at his palace recently.
	   The cake measured about two metres long, one-and-a-half-metre
wide and a metre high.
	   The hotel executive pastry chef and his seven-member team worked
day and night for a month, which resulted in a masterpiece of
intricate designs.
	   Seven pedestals of different heights, made from icing sugar were
placed on top of the cake, each holding a platform.
	   On the platform, sketch portraits spanning the various stages of
His Majesty's life were displayed.
	   The sketches varied from his childhood days to school days, his
career as a diplomat, his marriage, succession to the throne and
His Majesty's present portrait.
	   The cake was presented to the King by the hotel general manager
Mark J.
	   Heywood who was accompanied by the executive pastry chef Herve
Potus, executive chef Horst Fuetterer, sous chef Tan Kong Eng,
pastry chef Teh Chee Fook and chief artist Ramlan Rus Abu.
	   Meanwhile, the Renaissance and New World Hotel Kuala Lumpur
presented a cake measuring about two sq metres and weighed more
than 100 kg to the King.
	   The ``musical instruments'' decorations were made of sugar as
the base and coated with chocolate featuring a violin, trumpet,
saxaphone, drum and harp while the cake resembled a piano.
	   Hotel pastry chef Robert Polz said: ``We decided to present a
cake resembling musical instruments since the Agong loves classical
music and the arts.''
	   He said a team of three chefs took about two weeks to finish the
decorations alone.
	   The chefs who had been working to complete the decorations were
Polz, assistant pastry chef Patrick Song Eng Kiew and first commis
Nafisah Mohd Ali.
	   The Federal Hotels International group in Malaysia comprising
the Federal Hotel, The Crown Princess Kuala Lumpur, The Fairlane
Hotel, Hotel Capitol and Ferringhi Beach Hotel, Penang also
presented a birthday cake to the King.
	   Made in the shape of an antique chest with intricate chocolate
carvings, the cake weighed 50kg.
	   On the top drawer of the chest, the fillings comprised pralines
and mini truffles while the lower section was a sliding tray of
fruit cake covered with yellow icing.
	   On the exterior, the King's royal head dress made of solid
chocolate was majestically placed on a golden pillow.
	   The elaborate cake was designed by the pastry kicthen team, led
by the executive pastry chef Karamir Godrei of the Crown Princess
Kuala Lumpur.
	   The Sunway Lagoon Resort Hotel presented a rich chocolate cake
named A Vintage Rendition where three miniature vintage cars
resembling the ones owned by the King were created.
	   The vintage cars were a 1907 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost, a 1931
Rolls Royce P11 Continental Special Sports Saloon and a 1961 MGA.
	   These vintage cars were carved out of rich chocolate and covered
with marzipan.
	   Weighing 40kg, the creation was the brainchild of the hotel
general manager Georges Chauve.

Prisoner on jogging tour leaves his guards in the dust

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A Norwegian prisoner proved the value of
physical fitness when he ran away from his four prison guards
during a jog and escaped.
	   When the small entourage reached a recreation area outside the
prison in the northern town of Bodoe, the prisoner picked up the
pace, pulled ahead of his jailors and escaped, the Norwegian news
agency NTB reported on Thursday. The agency did not say when he
escaped.
	   The prisoner, identified only as a man in his late 20s, had been
jailed for petty crimes. He had been granted special privileges,
including excursions outside the prison, the report said.
	   The escapee can expect to have his privileges revoked, assuming,
of course, that police catch up to him.

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Police officers from 23 countries met
in Budapest to seek more efficient ways to combat illegal traffic
in art treasures, a police official said Thursday.
	   Held under the auspices of Interpol, the International Police
Organization, the three-day closed meeting allowed the officers to
make personal contact and to help their East European counterparts
catch up.
	   ``We have a five-member team working on illegal art traffic, and
the group was set up only this April, while France has over 30
policemen in the same detail and with many years of experience,''
Hungarian police Col. Tamas Simon said.
	   Illegal art traffic is a growth industry.
	   In 1990, the year after communism collapsed, there were 702
registered cases in Hungary, and the total value of the stolen
treasures was 71 million forints (dlrs 340,000 in present terms).
	   In 1993, there were 906 cases worth a total of 158 million
forints (dlrs 750,000) and in 1996, 1,025 cases involving 430
million forints (dlrs two million) worth of stolen treasures.
	   ``This is a special area of police work as stolen art may not
appear for 30 years on the market,'' said Jean Pierre Jouanny,
director of the French national bureau of Interpol.
	   Hungary is largely a transit country for stolen art, with the
line of traffic moving from east to west.
	   Work is underway in cataloging the country's art treasures,
establishing a data base and a network of contacts among art
dealers, auctioneers and museums.

	   JOHOR BARU, Wed. - Johor, which was once the favourite landing
point for Indonesian illegal immigrants, recorded no such landings
at all over the past month, Menteri Besar Datuk Abdul Ghani Othman
said today.
	   What is more surprising is that the trend now appears to have
reversed.
	   Hundreds of illegal immigrants have been nabbed by Johor police
over the past two months trying to leave the country ``illegally''
by sea.
	   ``There were zero landings of illegal immigrants over the past
month,''
	   Ghani told reporters after chairing the State Executive Council
meeting today.
	   ``Many illegal immigrants are in fact trying to find their way
back to Indonesia, probably because they feel it will be safer for
themselves and their families if they return.''
	   Ghani said such immigrants preferred to leave illegally because
they feared being separated from family members if caught by the
authorities and sent to detention centres.
	   State Traffic Police and Public Order division chief
Superintendent Ajis Salimin said political and economic problems in
Indonesia were probably the main reason for the drop in numbers.
	   ``In the past, the illegal immigrants had to borrow money, pawn
their jewellery and sell their lands and belongings to pay the
tekong fare to come across illegally,'' Ajis said.
	   ``Since times are hard, many are unable to find the money to pay
the tekong.
	   ``Also, tougher enforcement here and the reluctance of employers
to hire them, has made the situation here unattractive, and they
probably find that they are better off staying put in their own
country.''
	   Johor, with its long coastline and its proximity to Indonesia,
has traditionally been a landing point for illegal immigrants.
	   The number of illegal landings increased sharply after the the
regional currency problem last year.
	   The problem reached critical point early this year, when
thousands of illegal immigrants were caught trying to sneak into
the country.
	   About 4,000 illegals were arrested in Johor in the first three
months alone, as compared to 5,500 for the whole of last year.
	   The scenario has now changed. Ajis said about 70 illegal
immigrants had been nabbed trying to leave the country illegally in
June alone.
	   An estimated 200 illegals were similarly caught last month. Ajis
said most of them were taking their savings - accumulated from work
here - with them.
	   Ajis contended that the illegals probably chose not to go home
via legal channels, so as to avoid paying fines or dealing with the
immigration authorities.
	   Ghani meanwhile said the State authorities would closely monitor
the situation after Aug 15, when the permits of a large number of
immigrant workers would expire.

New bridge link to continent means end of ferry line

	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Danish motorists driving across their
island-studded country are ready for the fast lane.
	   On Sunday, they will have to give up coffee breaks on ferries
for the chance to reach their destination an hour earlier. A new
bridge opens across an 18-kilometer (11-mile) stretch of water
putting the ferries out of business.
	   The bridge, between the islands of Zealand, where Copenhagen is
situated, and Funen, linked to the Jutland peninsula and the
European continent, is the second-longest span bridge after the
Akashi Kaikyo Bridge in Japan.
	   ``Think about the change,'' said Uffe Paludan from the Institute
for Future Studies. ``One day there is a barrier across the country
and the next day it's almost been wiped off the map.''
	   Although Danes are sentimental about the black-and-white boats,
the ferries hindered spontaneous travel because tickets had to be
booked well in advance to ensure a place on the packed vessels.
	   The first railway ferry opened on the route in 1883. Fifty years
later, car ferries began plying the stretch, known as Storebaelt
(Danish for big strait).
	   Since modern terminals opened in the ports of Halsskov and
Knudshoved in 1957, 200 million people have used the boats on
Denmark's busiest ferry route. The ferries, with a maximum capacity
of 1,200 passengers and 300 cars, leave every 30 minutes in each
direction.
	   Last year, the Storebaelt link opened for trains which travel
through an eight-kilometer (five-mile) underwater tunnel to an
island, and then along a seven-kilometer (four-mile) bridge.
	   The train trip takes only 11 minutes. Ferry passengers spend 50
minutes aboard, in addition to time wasted when the boats load and
unload.
	   The toll on the four-lane highway bridge is 210 kroner (dlrs
30), while a one-way ferry crossing costs 335 kroner (dlrs 48).
	   In addition to easing travel, the new link will help businesses
and haulage companies.
	   ``Goods can be transported whenever they are needed because the
bridge will be open all year round, 24 hours a day,'' said Jens
Hennild of the Danish Federation of Industries. ``We don't need
stocks any longer. We can transport goods right away.''
	   Construction of the bridge, begun in 1988, took four years
longer than planned doubling its cost to 38 billion kroner (dlrs
5.3 billion).
	   The new bridge will be a major link in a road network which will
allow motorists to drive from the Arctic Circle to southern Spain
at the turn of the century, when a bridge-tunnel link between
Copenhagen and Malmoe, Sweden, is scheduled to be completed.

Police round up 21 people in mafia sweep

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A judge in Naples has issued 21 arrest warrants for
suspected members of the Neapolitan mafia and ordered property
worth dlrs 100 million seized, the ANSA news agency said Thursday.
	   The report said the suspects are believed to belong to a branch
of the Naples mafia, the Camorra, run by Mario Fabbrocino, who has
been jailed in Argentina since last year.
	   Some of the suspects named in the warrants were already in
custody, it said, while others were picked up by police in Italy,
Germany and Argentina. Among them were Fabbrocino's son Giovanni,
who was arrested after visiting his father in a Buenos Aires
prison.
	   ANSA said the investigation probed the Fabbrocino gang's
connections in Argentina, Venezuela, Germany, France, Spain and
Portugal.
	   The property seized was allegedly part of an international
money-laundering operation, it said. The Fabbrocino clan is also
said to be involved, among other things, in extortion and crooked
contracts.

Hells Angel acquitted of murdering rival in Nordic biker war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A 31-year-old member of the Hells Angels
motorcycle gang was acquitted Thursday of murdering a member of the
rival Bandidos gang last year during a biker war that left 12
people dead in the Nordic countries.
	   The Norwegian had been charged with first-degree murder in the
July 15, 1996 shooting of Jens Krogh Jensen, a Dane belonging to a
Swedish chapter of the Bandidos. Jensen was found shot to death
near Drammen, a town 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Oslo, hours
after police broke up a scuffle between Hells Angels and Bandidos
in the center of Oslo.
	   The district court in the town of Hokksund, about 40 kilometers
(25 miles) west of Oslo, ruled that there was insufficient evidence
to convict the Hells Angels, the Norwegian news agency NTB
reported. The Hells Angels' name was not released in keeping with
Norwegian practice.
	   Members of both gangs who were called as witnesses during the
trial, which began May 25, claimed to recall little about the
shooting.
	   ``The ruling is correct based on the evidence that was
presented,'' defense attorney Oeyvind Elseth was quoted as telling
NTB.
	   The shooting was widely seen as part of a more than three-year
Nordic bikers' gang war that ended about nine months ago. The local
chapters of the U.S.-based gangs had engaged in anti-tank-grenade
attacks, bombings and shootings that left 12 people dead and at
least 70 injured in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - There is a need to streamline management
policies and legislation for wildlife parks to ensure conservation
efforts are effective, Science, Technology and Environment Minister
Datuk Law Hieng Ding said today.
	   He has asked the Wildlife and National Parks Department to call
for a meeting with the State authorities on the matter. Most parks
come under State jurisdiction and each has differing policies and
legislation.
	   A streamlined and integrated management policy will go a long
way in conservation efforts because any activity in one State can
affect wildlife sanctuaries in another.
	   Law said in Peninsular Malaysia, the National parks were managed
by the Wildlife and National Parks Department whereas State parks
were under State jurisdiction.
	   For Sabah and Sarawak, all wildlife sanctuaries were managed by
the States.
	   ``There is room for improvement where management aspect is
concerned,''
	   Law said when commenting on an article about rhinoceros
conservation in yesterday's New Straits Times' Life &AMP; Times
section.
	   According to the article, the rhinoceros conservation programmes
is affected by lack of funds due to a budget cut arising from the
economic problem.
	   Department sources revealed that the Endau-Rompin rhinoceros
population population is down to fewer than five from 20 to 25 five
years ago.
	   Law has also been urging State Governments to set up more
wildlife sanctuaries, be it State or National park, as a long-term
wildlife protection measure.
	   ``I have also urged them to carry out more research on species
and carry out more educational programmes to create awareness,'' he
said.
	   On weather forecasts, Law said the dry spell that traditionally
begins in June to September had already arrived.
	   He said there had been no information on whether the La Nina
weather phenomenon would happen. However, the El Nino is showing
signs of tapering off.
	   ``Even the World Meteorological Services Department cannot give
any precise weather prediction.
	   ``If La Nina occurs, we will get rain which is good in a way.
There will be less open burning and no haze,'' he added.
	   Asked if the Government was prepared for any eventuality if La
Nina wreaks havoc, he said the National Security Division was on
standby.
	   On air quality, Law said the situation has been generally good.
The highest air pollutant index reading was Nilai with 100. Most
areas recorded good readings.
	   He said the latest report from the Singapore-based Asean
Specialised Meteorological Centre implied that the whole region was
generally free from haze.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ Reuniting art divided by communism, Berlin opens
its new museum for 13th-18th century European paintings this week,
a long-awaited restoration of the city's once-celebrated
collection.
	   ``With the reopening, the Berlin museum will once again reach
world recognition,'' museum director Jan Kelch said Thursday at a
press conference. After a weekend of celebrations, the museum opens
to the public on Sunday.
	   The Berlin Painting Gallery, located in the city's commercial
center, Potsdamer Platz, reestablishes the collection housed from
1830 until World War II in the Altes Museum. Its masterpieces
include works by Duerer, Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Botticelli and
Gainsborough.
	   During the war, the Nazis stored the paintings in salt mines or
air-raid shelters, where most of them survived undamaged. Under
communism, however, the collection was divided, just as the city
was.
	   Paintings hid from bombing raids in the city's eastern sectors
stayed in the Bode Museum in then-East Berlin, behind the Berlin
Wall. Paintings that wound up in West Berlin were displayed or
housed in the Dahlem Museum.
	   The Berlin Painting Gallery joins 1,250 paintings from former
East Berlin with 1,650 from the former West. It stands near the New
National Gallery, the city's contemporary art collection.

Carlos Moya latest upset victim at Gerry Weber Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS dropped word ``champion'' in 1st graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HALLE, Germany (AP) _ French Open champion Carlos Moya Thursday
became the latest upset victim at the Gerry Weber Open when the
Spaniard was ousted in straight sets by Germany's Hendrik
Dreekmann.
	   Dreekman served 10 double faults, but attacked the net at every
chance to roll past the Spaniard 7-5, 6-3 and reach the
quarterfinals of the dlrs 875,000 tuneup for Wimbledon.
	   ``My serve wasn't exactly good, but I had a little luck today.
There were a few key points and I won them,'' said Dreekmann.
	   Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the defending champion, advanced
with a 6-4, 6-3 victory over Germany's David Prinosil, rallying to
avoid the upset trend. In the first two rounds, five seeds have
been ousted, including No. 1 Petr Korda.
	   Prinosil broke Kafelnikov's serve early in both sets, but let
4-1 and 3-0 leads slip away as his errors mounted. The second-seed
then swept to victory in just 54 minutes when the German crashed a
volley into the net.
	   Sweden's Magnus Norman also reached the quarterfinals by
struggling past Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands, 6-4, 5-7, 6-3.
	   Dreekmann, who has slumped from the world No. 36 to 101, needed
an hour, 27 minute to make Moya his second big-name victim at the
event. He also handed compatriot Boris Becker a first-round loss.
	   The 23-year-old drew cheers from the German crowd by slamming
some pinpoint returns and constantly gambling at the net against
Moya, struggling to adjust to grass after winning Roland Garros two
weeks ago.
	   ``Today it was nice to enjoy the full support of the
spectators,'' said Dreekmann. ``On Tuesday, they clearly wanted
Becker to win.''
	   Becker's popularity is so vital to the tournament that Karsten
Braasch Wednesday accused the referees of favoring the German star
in a doubles match.
	   Braasch and Jens Knippschild lost an all-German doubles match to
Becker and Prinosil after winning the first set.
	   Braasch objected to a call against his team that prevented a
break for a decisive 5-3 second-set lead.
	   ``That was an effrontery what happened on the court,'' Braasch
said. ``It can't be that things like that happen just to keep a
certain player in the tournament.''
	   Braasch apologized Thursday, while the ATP refused to comment on
that matter.

	   KUCHING, Wed. - The State Government is looking for suitable
sites to build settlements for workers employed in the
manufacturing and construction sectors to overcome squatter
problems in towns.
	   Assistant Minister of Planning and Resources Management Awang
Tengah Ali Hasan said today that the Government had directed the
Land Custody and Development Authority to identify sites for the
purpose.
	   Speaking after handing over temporary occupation licences to 29
squatters from Attapah area, he said the settlements would have
basic amenities like electricity and water.
	   ``We have found that these workers, who are from the rural
areas, make up a sizeable number of squatters in towns like
Kuching, Sibu, Bintulu and Miri.
	   ``Hopefully, such a scheme will help the Government arrest the
squatter problem,'' he said, adding that the settlements would be
solely for workers who intended to stay temporarily in the urban
areas before returning to their villages.
	   The other measures which the Government had implemented were the
introduction of resettlement schemes for TOL holders, building more
low- and medium low-cost houses in the urban areas for the
squatters and lower- income groups, and strict monitoring and law
enforcement by the Land and Survey Department, he said.
	   Earlier, Awang Tengah warned TOL holders to build their houses
within two years on being given the lots by the Government.
	   He said the Land and Survey Department will withdraw TOL from
holders who failed to build their houses within the stipulated
period.
	   Those who received their TOLs today will be resettled at the the
Stampin resettlement scheme.

Regulators want to speed up Holocaust insurance claims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ U.S. insurance commissioners have met with their
European counterparts for the first time to discuss ways to quickly
resolve claims of Holocaust survivors and victims' heirs,
Washington State's commissioner said Thursday.
	   ``Everyone has the same goal _ to make sure survivors are
paid,'' Deborah Senn said. ``We want to move the process forward
quickly because the survivors are aging.''
	   The meeting Wednesday was attended by insurance officials from
Switzerland, France and Austria and commissioners from eight U.S.
states who are on a Holocaust task force set up by The National
Association of Insurance Commissioners.
	   A class-action lawsuit filed last year in New York accuses 16
European insurance companies of refusing to honor the policies of
Nazi victims. It seeks dlrs 1 billion from each company.
	   New York lawyer Edward Fagan, who filed the suit, contends more
than 10,000 people who purchased life, disability and property
policies in prewar and World War II Europe from companies based in
Austria, Germany, France, Italy and Switzerland were denied
legitimate claims.
	   The London meeting followed the signing of a memorandum of
understanding in April between U.S. states and European insurance
companies ``to begin the process of doing an accounting and sorting
out the claims of Holocaust survivors,'' Senn said.
	   By the end of May, 43 states and six European companies had
signed, she said.
	   Memorandum signers have agreed to set up an international
commission to investigate policies of Holocaust victims and a fund
to settle unpaid claims of Holocaust victims, and to meet with
European government and insurance officials to speed up payouts.
	   On Wednesday, American regulators met their European
counterparts for the first time ``to discuss the issue of how there
can be a process to get this resolved,'' Senn said.
	   It was not decided whether there would be more meetings, she
said.
	   The six insurance companies that have signed the memorandum of
understanding are among the 16 named in the class-action suit, or
their successor companies. They are Germany's Allianz AG and
Nordsetrn, Italy's Assicurazioni Generali, Switzerland's Zurich
Insurance and Winterthur, and France's AXA Group, Senn said.
	   Allianz, Assicurazioni Generali, Axa and Zurich hold the largest
number of survivors' claims, according to California Insurance
Commissioner Charles Quackenbush.

Hoards of cameras deter duchess from seeing Istanbul sights

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Weary of an army of cameras pestering
her in the sweltering heat, Fergie cut short her sightseeing tour
of Istanbul on Thursday.
	   Sarah Ferguson, the duchess of York, admired the 17th-century
Blue Mosque, but gave the Covered Bazaar and two famous Ottoman
palaces a miss.
	   In the morning, she visited a children's hospital, promising to
help raise drs 1 million. The duchess, who is the ex-wife of
Britain's Prince Andrew, was to attend a fundraiser for the
hospital later in the day.
	   Fergie was in Istanbul as the guest of the owner of Star TV, Cem
Uzan. Uzan's aides tried to persuade cameramen and photographers to
back off. When that failed, they said the duchess was cutting short
her sightseeing because of their constant pushing and shoving.

	   PETALING Jaya Selatan MP Donald Lim said Jalan Gasing residents
would meet Petaling Jaya Municipal Council officials today to
discuss their unhappiness over the widening of the road.
	   Residents are expected to hear answers to issues raised in a
memorandum sent to the MPPJ recently.
	   ``According to residents, they were not consulted before the
project began. Residents feel that after the road has been widened,
those living in adjacent houses will find it difficult to drive out
of their homes,'' he told the New Straits Times after visiting the
Seri Setia Old Folk's Home in Seri Setia.
	   ``I understand their anger as they were not consulted. According
to MPPJ, the road is too narrow and heavily used. Therefore, there
was a need to widen it.''
	   The council also planned to cover drains along the road to
prevent water from overflowing.
	   The project is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
	   Meanwhile, Lim said Section 5 residents were receiving water
from MPPJ as scheduled.
	   He said the situation has improved since residents protested
against poor water supply last month.
	   He said MPs, NGOs, residents and consumer associations would
meet Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar on June 25 to
discuss problems due to inadequate water supply.
	   ``It is a good thing that the State Government is having the
meeting. It will give an opportunity to NGOs and associations to
present their views.
	   ``The rationing programme is not working. It has never followed
the schedule.
	   ``At this meeting, we hope a new plan will be formulated.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - The High Court today ordered a company and
three others to stop manufacturing an anti-theft car gadget on
grounds that they were not its copyright owners.
	   Judge Datuk R.K. Nathan said the copyright in the form of all
information and trade secrets of the device belonged to Australian
companies, Electro Cad Australia Pty Ltd and Stopcard Pty Ltd
(Australia).
	   In making the order, he directed Mejati RCS Sdn Bhd, Lai Kar
Fatt, V- Kool (M) Sdn Bhd and Central Monitoring System Sdn Bhd to
stop manufacturing, distributing or selling their gadget under the
brand name ``Stopcar''.
	   He held that the gadget possessed features identical to that
manufactured by the Australians under the name ``Stopcard''.
	   The plaintiffs had claimed that the defendants were producing
the device based on information and trade secrets obtained from
them.
	   The device enables the owner of a car to stop the engine of his
car by just dialing a number in his telephone and another procedure
is needed to re-start the car.
	   The Australians said their device, Stopcard Auto Theft Device
(Stopcard) and the Malaysian-made ``Stopcar'' were identical as
both had the same functions and worked on the same system.
	   Nathan, in allowing a claim by Electro Cad, Stopcard and
Stopcard (M) Sdn Bhd, also stopped the defendants from passing off
``Stopcar'' as the product of the plaintiffs and from divulging or
using any information obtained from the plaintiffs.

Norway sends military transport plane to assist Kosovo refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway on Thursday announced that it was
sending a military transport aircraft to bring emergency medical
supplies needed by refugees fleeing the Kosovo province of Serbia.
	   Norway, a member of NATO, was sending the aircraft as the same
time as the alliance was considering possible military intervention
to stop Yugoslav forces from further military action in Serbia's
secessionist Kosovo province.
	   More than 250 people have been killed and thousands have fled
since police began a crackdown in March on militants in the
province, where ethnic Albanians have been ruled repressively since
Serbia stripped Kosovo of its broad autonomy in 1989. Serbia is
part of Yugoslavia.
	   The Norwegian defense ministry said its Hercules C-130 transport
plane and volunteer crew would transport medical supplies from the
Bosnian cities of Sarajevo and Banja Luka to the Albanian capital
of Tirana. A news release said they initially would be available
from Friday through June 17.

	   RELA has been urged to establish more units in new housing
estates to help improve security for residents.
	   Balakong State Assemblyman Hoh Hee Lee said the organisation
could complement efforts by police which was facing a shortage of
staff.
	   He said Rela members could help curb crime and other social
problems by getting more local residents to join the organisation.
	   He was speaking to 150 Rela members, include 10 women, who
participated in the annual Hulu Langat District Rela shooting
competition at the Kajang Shooting Club practice ground in Sungai
Jeluh, Kajang recently.
	   Hoh said the housing estates in his constituency like Taming
Jaya, Sungai Ramal Long House needed Rela units to help reduce
crime.
	   On efforts to improve the Rela image, he said it should organise
more publicity campaigns on its role in society.
	   He praised the district Rela for organising the function and
encouraging an interest in shooting.
	   ``This shooting ground is among the few public shooting centres
owned by a shooting club, therefore more people in the district can
come and learn about shooting.''
	   Hoh also agreed to help the district Rela equip the new Kajang
Rela activity centre in Sungai Chua which is still under
construction.
	   District Rela officer Suprat Karjani, in his welcome speech,
said the 2,000 Rela members in the district also organised
community projects.

World Cup: Italy-Chile tied 1-1 at halftime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Marcelo Salas tied the game three
minutes into first half injury time as Chile hit back to hold Italy
1-1 at half time of their World Cup game Thursday.
	   Christian Vieri fired the Italians ahead after 10 minutes off a
sideways pass by Roberto Baggio and the leveller came from a corner
in the 48th minute.
	   Fabien Estay swung in the flag kick, Ivan Zamorano powered in a
header, Pedro Reyes touched the ball on and Salas, who joins
Italy's Lazio next season, turned to fire the ball home.
	   Italy, playing in all-white, took the lead in the 10th minute
with a stunning counter-attack after Zamorano, who ironically plays
for Inter Milan, lost possession deep in the Italian half.
	   Vieri and Baggio were well advanced with only two Chilean
defenders between them and the goal and the 1994 World Cup star
collected a long through ball from Paolo Maldini.
	   Instead of heading for goal, Baggio unselfishly slipped the ball
sideways to the better positioned Vieri who slid it home from 15
yards (meters) with his left foot.
	   Lineups:
	   Italy _ Gianluca Pagliuca; Alessandro Nesta, Paolo Maldini,
Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Costacurta, Dino Baggio, Angelo Di
Livio, Demetrio Albertini, Roberto Di Matteo, Christian Vieri,
Roberto Baggio.
	   Chile _ Nelson Tapia; Ronald Fuentes, Pedro Reyes, Javier
Margas, Moises Villarroel, Francisco Rojas, Nelson Parraguez,
Clarence Acuna, Fabian Estay, Ivan Zamorano, Marcelo Salas.
	   Referee: Lucian Bouchardeau, Nigeria.

Iraq bans tourists from Kurdish north
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that Irbil, Dahouk and Sulaimaniya NOT under
government control &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The government has banned local and foreign
tourists from traveling to northern Iraq, saying American and
Israeli agents are roaming freely in the area, a Baghdad weekly
reported Thursday.
	   Al-Zawra said the government's Tourism Department issued orders
to travel agencies asking them not to organize trips to the
districts of Irbil, Dahouk and Sulaimaniya, which are not under
government control.
	   Northern Iraq is under the control of Kurdish rebels who are
helped by the United States and Britain. The two nations' air
forces enforce a no-fly zone over the area to keep away the Iraqi
military.
	   ``The extraordinary situation in our beloved north and the
presence of American and Zionist (Israeli) agents there makes the
region unstable from the security point of view,'' the weekly said,
quoting Tourism Department head Abdulkarim Maki.
	   It did not elaborate and Maki was not immediately available for
comment.
	   The ban on travel applies only to tourists. People who have
relatives or legitimate business in the area can still go. Most of
the tourists to northern Iraq are people from central and southern
Iraq, escaping the scorching summer heat or seeking winter snow
holidays.
	   Travel agents in Baghdad said thousands of Iraqis had signed up
for package tours this summer.
	   Foreign tourists rarely visit Iraq, and those who do hardly ever
go to Kurdish areas.
	   The decision to ban tourists is a surprise because state-owned
television and another station owned by President Saddam Hussein's
eldest son, Odai, recently began broadcasting commercials promoting
the region. It is not clear if the media campaign was coordinated
with the Kurdish rebels.

August start for new Swiss Guards commander
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss army colonel named as the new
commander of the pope's Swiss Guards said Thursday he will take up
the post in early August.
	   Pius Segmueller, 46, confirmed that he will move to Rome after
leaving his present job in July.
	   Pope John Paul II named Segmueller as commander last week, a
month after predecessor Alois Estermann was fatally shot along with
his wife, apparently by a disgruntled young guardsman.
	   Segmueller is currently with the Swiss army's Bern-based
Hospital Regiment 12. He said he would take a few days' vacation to
prepare for his new job.
	   The timing of his move means that former commander Roland Buchs,
who agreed to take charge while the Vatican found a replacement for
Estermann, will still be in charge when 40 new guardsmen are sworn
in on June 28.

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Eritrean aircaft bombed an
Ethiopian town, and ground fighting flared on two fronts Thursday,
as Rwandan and U.S. promoters of a peace plan returned to the
Ethiopian capital.
	   Eritrean helicopters and warplanes dropped at least eight bombs
on the northeastern border town of Adigrat on Thursday evening. To
of the bombs hit a combined industrial-residential area in the town
of 40,000, setting grain warehouses on fire.
	   Witneses said at least one person was killed and three injured.
Ethiopian government spokeswoman Salome Tadesse said in the capital
Addis Ababa that women and children had been killed, but said she
had no more details.
	   Adigrat about 20 kilometers (12 miles) southwest of Zala
Ambessa, the border town captured by Eritrean forces last week.
	   Ground clashes broke out Thursday in the region of Eritrea's
crucial Red Sea port of Assab _ an area that had not seen previous
fighting _ and in the Yirga triangle area where the conflict began
May 6.
	   Rwandan Vice President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame, whose
country along with the United States has authored a peace plan,
returned to Addis Ababa on Thursday. There was no indication
whether the presence of Kagame, Rwanda's de facto leader, indicated
an advance in the plan's prospects.
	   Ethiopia has already voiced support for the plan, which calls
for Eritrea to pull back troops to the positions they held before
fighting broke out. Eritrea has said the plan needs more work, but
has not specified its objections.
	   Regional military sources say the plan calls for Rwanda to
supply the peacekeepers to enforce demilitarization of disputed
border regions.
	   Kagame and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice
vigorously shuttled during May to promote the plan. The U.S.
Embassy said the team now in Addis Ababa does not include Rice but
declined to say who was on it.
	   Eritrean and Ethiopian troops fought along a road surrounded by
sand dunes at the border southwest of the Eritrean port of Assab.
That region is where landlocked Ethiopia's border comes closest to
the Red Sea, about 75 kilometers (45 miles) away.
	   As in the past, each side accused the other of provoking the
fight.
	   ``Ethiopia had been amassing troops in the area in preparation
for this attack,'' the Eritrean government said in a statemeent.
	   Fighting also was reported along the Badme-Shiraro front inside
the northwestern Yirga triangle region, a 400-square-kilometer
(160-square-mile) patch of disputed territory. Salome, the
Ethiopian spokeswoman, said the fighting was at the Erde Mattios
military post.
	   She said Eritrean forces were repulsed and suffered heavy losses
in both attacks. But such claims have been standard by both sides,
and no reliable casualty counts have come out.
	   Thursday was the first time fighting had flared in the Assab
area. Ethiopia has boycotted the port, 650 kilometers (400 miles)
to the northeast of the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa since
fighting broke out a month ago.
	   Until the current border dispute erupted into fighting, Ethiopia
exported most of its coffee _ its chief foreign-currency earner _
through Assab. It now uses the port of Djibouti south of Assab on
the Gulf of Aden.
	   The fighting comes amid growing international efforts to prevent
the clashes from escalating into a full-scale war.
	   Along with the presence of Kagame and the American team in the
Ethiopian capital, a delegation from the Organization of African
Unity is expected next week.
	   Eritrea, meanwhile, proposed that Egypt join the United States
and Rwanda in attempts at mediation.
	   Eritrean rebels fought Ethiopia for 30 years to gain
independence. They succeeded in 1993, two years after helping
Ethiopian rebels under Meles Zenawi _ who is now prime minister _
oust a 17-year military dictatorship.
	   The 53-nation OAU said its delegation will try to persuade both
parties to agree to a cease-fire and peace talks. Eritrean Foreign
Minister Haile Woldetensae welcomed the proposal and said his
country was willing to withdraw immediately from disputed
territory. There was no comment from his Ethiopian counterpart.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ His nascent leadership just days old,
Nigeria's new military ruler faces his first challenge Friday from
a vocal and ubiquitous opposition defiantly calling for a mass
demonstration and a nationwide strike.
	   Critics were watching to see _ if the strike and protest take
place _ whether Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar would show uncommon
tolerance, or crush his opponents, in keeping with an all too
common precedent set by his heavy-handed predecessor, the late Gen.
Sani Abacha.
	   Local military chiefs in the commercial capital of Lagos hinted
Thursday that they would use force if pro-democracy activists push
forward to rally the masses.
	   ``Such demonstrations are unnecessary at this point in time,''
said Lagos military administrator Col. Mohammed Marwa. ``This is a
time for prayers.''
	   The protest originally aimed to mark five years since the
annulment of June 12, 1993, presidential elections which would have
ended military rule. However, the demonstration call has taken on
added significance, coming just three days after Abubakar became
this West African nation's latest military ruler.
	   Marwa refused to grant demonstration permits Thursday and
ominously warned government opponents to ``avoid any situation that
would invite the use of force.''
	   Abubakar has deeply angered opposition groups by offering only a
vague pledge to move forward with Abacha's flawed democratic reform
program.
	   Abacha promised to hand power over to civilians, but then
manipulated the process to become the only candidate for president.
His military regime vetted all political parties and reserved the
right to disqualify candidates in legislative and gubernatorial
polls.
	   Abubakar has said nothing that distinguishes his pledge to
continue the government transition process from that of Abacha, who
died of a heart attack Monday.
	   Moreover, Abubakar _ within hours of taking power _ appeared to
be moving swiftly to consolidate power and eliminate potential
rivals. Two members of his inner circle were under house arrest in
the capital of Abuja, two sources told The Associated Press.
	   Government critics who want to push Abubakar and the army out of
power say they will challenge the new leader's mandate in the
courts and on the streets.
	   Gani Fawehinmi, a Lagos attorney and one of the country's
best-known opposition activists, said he would file a suit in the
Nigerian high court against Abubakar's appointment.
	   Yet there were doubts that an opposition weakened by a
systematic campaign of arrest, torture and imprisonment under
Abacha would be able to organize a sizeable protest _ and that
labor unions now under government control could pull off a
meaningful strike.
	   Fear of Nigeria's brutal security forces runs deep: Nearly every
prominent dissident is in jail or exile. So does apathy in a
population accustomed to being ignored and trod upon.
	   ``I've not heard of the rally,'' said Amafari Alfred-Belleh, a
cosmetics saleswoman. ``There's little or nothing the opposition
groups can do. They government has all the power, they have the
guns.''
	   ``They can round them all up if they want to,'' she said.
	   Authorities closed a number of technical colleges and a
university in Lagos in an apparent attempt to keep down the number
of students from demonstrating.
	   Insisting Friday's planned protests would go forward, Fawehinmi
said opponents of military rule would defy the local authorities.
	   ``We do not need a permit to exercise our fundamental rights,''
he said in an interview Thursday. ``We have a right to demonstrate
peacefully. We have a right to express our own views.''
	   With the economy of Africa's most populous nation in ruins
despite its vast oil reserves, there was much to protest.
	   Little in Nigeria functions these days, from the water supply to
the telephones. The only people who have a comfortable life are
those who can afford to buy generators, truck in their own water
and hire security guards to fend off rampant robbers.

NATO defense ministers OK exercises to warn Yugoslavia on Kosovo

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO will mount simulated air raids and
bombing runs over Albania and Macedonia in the next few days,
flexing its military muscle to warn Yugoslavia against attacking
ethnic Albanians in the separatist province of Kosovo.
	   Alliance defense ministers on Thursday authorized the air-power
exercise, which could launch NATO warplanes from French, British or
U.S. aircraft carriers in the Adriatic. Nearby air bases, such as
Aviano Air Base in Italy, could also be used in the effort.
	   ``The message is clear and unambiguous to Belgrade - think
again,'' said British Defense Secretary George Robertson. ``What we
are talking about here is diplomacy backed by the threat of
force.''
	   The NATO ministers expressed ``disgust and revulsion at the
increased levels of violence and repression'' ordered by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, Robertson said, adding, ``President
Milosevic must think again. He must change his tactics.''
	   ``At the end of the day ... there are options where the military
might of NATO may well be used against him,'' Robertson said,
adding the Yugoslav leader ``would be rash and foolish if he would
ignore the message coming from NATO.''
	   The exercise of allied military might recalls NATO's air strikes
over Bosnia several years ago _ its first military action ever _
which helped bring about the Dayton peace accords. Alliance
officials said they hoped the exercise would have the same effect,
without leading to actual strikes.
	   NATO has about 150 warplanes from 10 nations in the region in
support of the Bosnia operation, which could be put to use in the
exercise. The U.S. aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower has departed
Norfolk, Virginia, and could be in the Mediterranean within a week.
	   The NATO ministers issued a statement saying they intended to
seek Albania and Macedonia's approval ``to conduct an appropriate
air exercise in these two countries as quickly as possible, with
the aim of demonstrating NATO's ability to project power rapidly
into the region.''
	   A U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the exercise will be carried out in the next few days and
could include simulated rocket attacks by helicopters as well as
bombing raids by planes.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, in remarks to his 15
fellow NATO defense ministers meeting here, said such action, in
line with recommendations from NATO ambassadors, ``would serve as a
serious warning to Belgrade.''
	   The ministers also instructed NATO military planners to look
into direct military action in Kosovo, with ``particular
consideration to air strikes against selected targets and the
employment of air and-or ground forces if necessary to enforce a
settlement for Kosovo, as a last resort,'' Ruehe said.
	   According to the NATO statement, the exercise is designed to
convince Milosevic to order a cease-fire, withdraw Army forces and
halt the repression of the majority ethnic Albanians in the Serbian
province, and enter serious negotiations with separatists to end
the conflict.
	   ``We are focusing on the use of air power to achieve those
objectives,'' a NATO official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``We don't want to use force unless we absolutely have
to.''
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which has been battling Yugoslav
forces for independence, must also cease their armed struggle, NATO
said. The allies do not support their drive for independence.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen met privately with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana before he and NATO colleagues
agreed Thursday on steps to stop the fighting between the Serb-led
Yugoslav army and police against ethnic Albanians.
	   Speaking in Rome prior to flying to Brussels, Cohen said he
hoped the West would not have to resort to military action, but he
left the option open.
	   ``It is important to end this scandal of the bombing and
shelling of innocent people. We will work to achieve that at every
level _ diplomatic, economic and hopefully not military _ but we're
not ruling it out either,'' Cohen said at a news conference with
Italian Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta.
	   The NATO air action involving several nations will be conducted
under the command of Adm. Joseph Lopez, the Naples-based American
officer who heads NATO's Southern Command, a senior U.S. official
said. The exercises will involve land or sea-based aircraft flying
over Albania and Macedonia.
	   In Kosovo, more than 250 people have died in clashes between
government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of
the Albanian independence movement. Ethnic Albanians, who comprise
90 percent of the southern province's population, demand
independence from Serbia, dominant of Yugoslavia's two republics.

	   FUJITSU PC (Asia) Pte Ltd, a regional division of top Japanese
computer company Fujitsu Corporation, hopes to turn the Asian
economic problems to its advantage by grabbing market share from
less competitive personal computer manufacturers.
	   Along the lines of this renewed aggressiveness is its two-year
goal to become among the top five PC suppliers in Malaysia, a
market which contributes between 22 and 25 per cent to its sales in
the region.
	   Fujitsu Asia has set a modest target of 20,000 PCs for Malaysia
for the next nine months and intends to more-than-double its local
market share in two years.
	   Fujitsu Asia president and chief executive officer Masayuki
Tomimuro said this in Shah Alam yesterday after launching the new
range of Fujitsu Deskpower and Lifebook PC model series.
	   Formerly known as Fujitsu ICL Trading Asia Pte Ltd, the company
intends to leverage on the global business of its parent company
and to build up its brand in the region.
	   ``Our PC outlook in the region remains optimistic for our
growth. We too intend to take market share from the less
competitive in this business.
	   ``We feel that whilst we are aggressively positioning ourselves
during these difficult times, we will be well positioned to
increase market share and business growth,'' Tomimuro said.
	   Currently Asia PC sales represent less than five per cent of
Fujitsu Corporation's worldwide revenue which reached US$37 billion
(RM148 billion) last year, he said.
	   Fujitsu Corporation and other PC suppliers have been charting
negative Asia sales growth during the current economic problems but
are confident that sales in the region will pick up in two years,
he added.
	   When sales pick up in Malaysia, Fujitsu Corporation may consider
setting up full PC manufacturing facilities in the country to
complement its semiconductor and PC components manufacturing
facilities.
	   Fujitsu Asia (Malaysia Branch) managing director Yap Meow Siew
said the company hopes to increase its local market share to five
per cent in two years.

	   SUNGAI PETANI, Wed. - This year's joint military exercise
between Malaysian and Thai armed forces, codenamed Thamal, has been
cancelled due to the current economic downturn, Army Field
Commander Lt Jen Datuk Abdul Aziz Hassan said today.
	   The decision was agreed on at the 70th Regional Border
Committee, held at the Cinta Sayang Golf And Country Club today.
	   The meeting had also agreed to postpone indefinitely future
military exercises involving both countries.
	   ``We had to review our various tasks to save costs due to the
economic slowdown affecting both Malaysia and Thailand,'' said
Abdul Aziz.
	   Abdul Aziz, who headed the Malaysian delegation, was speaking at
a Press conference after the meeting.
	   The Thai delegation was led by the Royal Thai Army's Fourth Area
Commander Lt General Preecha Suwonasri.
	   The last Thamal exercise, involving the armies of both
countries, was held last year while the navies held two exercises
last year.
	   The Malaysian and Thai air forces were expected to participate
in this year's Thamal exercise.
	   Despite the cancellation of the exercises, Abdul Aziz said the
meeting generally agreed that the economic climate should not
affect the armed forces' efficiency, especially in addressing the
influx of illegal immigrants.
	   He said both Malaysia and Thailand acknowledged the need for
full co- operation to curb the transgression by illegals through
the countries' common border.
	   ``To date, both countries have co-operated very well to tackle
this problem,'' he said.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia warned Thursday it would
not tolerate any NATO actions on its territory, reacting to the
alliance's decision to deploy air power in an attempt to end
fighting in Serbia's secessionist Kosovo province.
	   The warning from Ivica Dacic, spokesman for the ruling
Socialists of President Slobodan Milosevic, came as NATO defense
ministers decided to stage simulated air raids and bombing runs
over neighboring Albania and Macedonia to halt further military
action by Yugoslav forces.
	   ``We are a sovereign country and without our consent, no actions
of any international alliance can be carried out on our territory _
especially since there is no reason for it,'' said Dacic, the
independent FoNet news agency reported.
	   In Kosovo, a prominent ethnic Albanian leader, Adem Demaci,
welcomed the NATO decision as ``the best and most economical way of
teaching the Serb regime a lesson.'' A direct air threat is much
more effective than ground troops on Kosovo's borders, he said.
	   After an apparent lull over the past 24 hours, both sides
reported fighting in Kosovo Thursday.
	   NATO and other western officials, are increasingly worried that
a lack of action in Yugoslavia _ consisting of Serbia and
Montenegro _ will send violence spiraling out of control in the
southern Balkans, dragging neighboring countries into the conflict
that has killed more than 250 people since March and forced tens of
thousands to flee their homes.
	   Yugoslavia does not threaten regional stability or peace, and
its forces are defending ``territorial integrity ... from terrorist
actions,'' Dacic said, reiterating that Yugoslavia will not give up
any territory.
	   The West, too, has denied the Kosovo Albanians' demand for
independence from Serbia. But NATO warned Milosevic should not
ignore its warnings of military strikes.
	   Dacic denied allegations of ethnic cleansing against Kosovo
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the province's population.
	   Serbian ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj said NATO threats of
action in Kosovo were ``programmed for psychological reasons,'' but
``a real danger should not be excluded,'' FoNet reported.
	   In the province, the Kosovo Information Center, close to the
ethnic Albanian leadership, claimed the Serb army was using heavy
artillery to shell villages near the border with Albanian in the
west of the province. The report could not be independently
confirmed.
	   Milosevic has ruled Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority with
repression, since stripping the province of broad autonomy in 1989.
Last March, Serbian forces launched a crackdown on militants of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, prompting daily skirmishes between the
government and the rebels.
	   Associated Press reporter Brian Murphy, in the border village of
Tropoja in Albania Thursday, saw a large convoy of mules loaded
with arms and other supplies, accompanied by some 100 armed
fighters, moving toward the mountains and the border with Kosovo.
	   Tony Lloyd, No. 2 in Britain's Foreign Office, met Albanian
leaders in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, and afterwards urged both
secessionists and Serbian authorities to compromise.
	   Lloyd blamed the government for most of the violence, but said
``our condemnation is equally about violence by the KLA in
Kosovo.''
	   Talks between the sides began last month under Western pressure,
but were suspended last week as the Albanians protested a Serbian
government offensive in western Kosovo.
	   Tanjug, the Yugoslav state news agency, said NATO should
pressure Kosovo's Albanian leaders to continue the talks, and
``take a serious look'' at Albania, which it called the source of
arms and training for the militants.
	   Russia, a traditional ally of fellow Orthodox Slavs in Serbia,
has invited Milosevic to visit Moscow next Monday and Tuesday,
Tanjug said without elaboration.
	   In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross launched
an appeal for 3.2 million Swiss francs (dlrs 2.2 million) to meet
refugees' food needs for four months, the group said in a
statement.

	   ZECON Engineering Berhad is expected to cushion the impact of
the present economic difficulties by depending on its ``wide base
and steady stream of customers''.
	   Executive chairman Zainal Abidin Ahmad said: ``The fact that we
are specialists and market leaders in the sub-sectors of foundation
and piling works, mechanical and electrical engineering as well as
in geo-technical works ensure that we have a wide base and steady
stream of customers.''
	   He added that it also helped that during the good years, Zecon
had restrained itself from diversifying aggressively.
	   ``We do not have the difficult task of down-sizing or
retrenching like other companies,'' he said after Zecon's annual
meeting in Kuching, Sarawak.
	   On the company's outlook for the current year, Zainal said Zecon
expected a slight dip in its profits in view of the current
economic situation but expressed optimism that the ``picture will
be much brighter by 1999''.
	   Zainal said the company had always been a prudent player and
this had been proven wise in this difficult times.
	   ``We have always kept a good eye on productivity and operational
efficiency and the figures (for 1997) show that we are on the right
track.''
	   Zecon managed to record positive growth for the year ended Dec
31, 1997 even though group turnover dipped slightly from RM103.49
million in 1996 to RM100.24 million last year.
	   Zecon, which is listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's
second board, recorded a group pre-tax profit of RM9.95 million
last year which was RM1.70 million or 16.8 per cent better than the
pre-tax profit recorded in 1996.
	   In future, Zecon plans to make inroads into property
development.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The World Court said Thursday it
has jurisdiction to deal with the protracted territorial dispute
between West African neighbors Nigeria and Cameroon.
	   By a vote of 14 to three, the court said it has the authority to
hear the conflict over land and maritime boundary between the two
nations.
	   At stake is the oil-rich Bakassi peninsula that once took the
two nations to the brink of war and triggered armed clashes in
recent years.
	   During earlier hearings, Nigeria had challenged the court's
jurisdiction and said the two sides should settle all boundary
disputes themselves.
	   But the court said in its decision, which took almost three
hours to read, the case submitted by Cameroon is admissible.
	   With the jurisdiction question out of the way, the court can
proceed to the actual merits of the case. No date was immediately
set for the next round of oral hearings.
	   A definitive ruling will take several more years.
	   Both nations claim the Bakassi peninsula, which juts into the
Gulf of Guinea where their borders meet.
	   The two nations almost went to war over Bakassi in 1981, and
ever since, there have been sporadic hostilities.
	   A series of clashes in 1996 led the court to call on both
parties to refrain from further military action.
	   The court, formally known as the International Court of Justice,
is the judicial arm of the United Nations.

Ambassadors take protest letter to Belarusian foreign ministers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Diplomats from 14 countries facing
eviction from their homes delivered a formal protest letter
Thursday to the Belarusian Foreign Ministry.
	   Belarus has told residents of a diplomatic compound they must
vacate their homes by June 17 so that urgent repairs can be made to
the sewage and water systems.
	   The ambassadors say that under international law, their
residences are considered sovereign territory and governments have
no right to enter without permission or insist that diplomats
leave.
	   Diplomats from 22 countries live in the compound in the pine
forests on the outskirts of Minsk. Ambassadors from Bulgaria and
some former Soviet republics have left, but the United States and
others want to stay during the repairs.

	   ALOR STAR, Wed. - Private colleges should offer students courses
and training in areas relevant to the country's needs at affordable
prices.
	   State Human Resources and Entrepreneur Development Committee
chairman Abdullah Hasnan Kamruddin said if fees were too high, many
local students would be deprived of the opportunity to pursue
tertiary education at these colleges.
	   He also urged private colleges to offer courses and training
that would help fulfil the country's human resources requirements.
	   ``At this time of economic difficulty, the colleges must offer
as much as they can at a cost affordable to the majority of
students,'' he said.
	   ``They should also ensure their graduates possess the knowledge
and ability to contribute to national development.''
	   He said this after witnessing the signing of a memorandum of
understanding between Institute Petua and Edith Cowan University of
Perth, and Jewels and Esk Valley College of Scotland yesterday to
establish a twinning programme between the institutions.
	   Institute Petua chairman Izhar Ismail signed on behalf of the
institute while ECU vice-chancellor Professor Millicent Poole and
the principal of Jewels and Esk Valley College John Lisgo signed
for their respective institutions.
	   Izhar said Institute Petua would initially offer a one-year
foundation course to students that would prepare them for a degree
at ECU.
	   He also said the institute would move to its new RM35 million
campus when it is ready in the middle of next year.

	   HALIM Securities Sdn Bhd's application to strike off a
winding-up petition by Multi Purpose Bank Bhd has been adjourned to
June 16.
	   In the petition filed on March 19, Multi Purpose is seeking to
wind up Halim Securities over its failure to pay loan facilities
amounting to RM15.9 million.
	   Halim Securities, which is already under trading restrictions,
was placed under the direct supervision of the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange from March 23 to prevent payment defaults and other
trading breaches by the stockbroker.
	   Multi Purpose also applied to strike off the validation order
obtained by Halim to pay its normal operating expenses including
salaries and Employees Provident Fund payments on April 29 from the
High Court.
	   Multi Purpose's application on this subject has been scheduled
to be heard today.
	   Following this, Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank sought an order
from the High Court on June 5 to validate the transfer of 40
million shares of Halim securities owned by Uniphoenix Corporation
to its nominee.
	   The Halim shares were pledged by Uniphoenix to Arab-Malaysian as
security for a syndicate loan of RM50 million. This matter is
scheduled to be heard on July 9.
	   Apart from that, Uniphoenix Corporation Bhd's application to
strike off the winding up petition by Multi Purpose Bank has been
postponed to June 22.

Israelis, Palestinians secretively discuss Geneva Convention

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian delegates Thursday ended a
secretive, groundbreaking meeting that could start a process for
dealing with Jewish settlements under international law.
	   The talks marked the first time Israel has attended negotiations
that implied any formal recognition that the Geneva Conventions on
the conduct of war have any application to territories it captured
in 1967.
	   The meeting fell far short of Arab and European demands that all
188 countries of the convention be convened to discuss enforcement
against settlement building.
	   Israel is especially eager to keep away the 15-nation European
Union, which it sees as pro-Palestinian.
	   Israel fears such an assembly could build pressure on Israel
over the settlements.
	   The Arab-European position has won overwhelming backing in the
U.N. General Assembly, with only the United States, Israel and
Micronesia voting against.
	   Israel, a signatory to the Geneva Convention, refuses to accept
its application to the territory it captured in the 1967 Mideast
war, which it maintains is Jewish land.
	   The Convention bans the usurpation of land by an occupying power
_ a provision the Palestinians and the European Union say would ban
settlement building.
	   Swiss sponsors of the talks told reporters after the three-day
session little more than that the two sides would meet again ``in
the near future.''
	   Switzerland, depository of the Geneva Conventions, proposed the
Israeli-Palestinian talks. The International Committee of the Red
Cross, charged with upholding the convention, also was represented.
	   The parties issued a joint statement but agreed not to divulge
the details of their discussions, Swiss delegation member Urs
Ziswiler said.
	   The meeting at a villa near Geneva was the first part of a
package proposed by the Swiss.
	   The second, an experts' meeting in ``early autumn'' of
signatories to the Fourth Geneva Convention, ``will be proposed in
the early days of July,'' said the statement.
	   The atmosphere at the meeting, which included a dinner attended
by Swiss President Flavio Cotti, was ``extremely cooperative and
professional,'' Ziswiler said.
	   Participants ``exchanged views on the feasibility of
establishing mechanisms and taking concrete measures to implement
the Fourth Geneva Convention,'' the 1949 update of the world's
ground rules for the conduct of war, the joint statement said.
	   ``Significant conceptual differences'' emerged on the
convention's implementation and its relation to the stalled Middle
East peace process, the statement said.
	   The two sides have failed to hold substantive peace talks since
Israeli settlement activity chilled discussions a year ago.
	   The statement said the Israelis and Palestinians agreed to
respect three principles for the discussions, it added:
	   _ to ``contribute to real improvements in the respect for
humanitarian law on the ground'';
	   _ to ``avoid any politicization of international humanitarian
law'';
	   _ and to ``support the peace process in the Middle East.''

World Cup: Danes confident of winning start against Saudi Arabia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS reference to Saudi's 6-0 loss to Norway &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Denmark may have lost all three of its
warmup matches, but its players expect three points Friday from
their first real World Cup outing, against Saudi Arabia.
	   ``We all feel 110 percent convinced that we will live up to the
playing style which we showed in the World Cup qualification
games,'' striker Brian Laudrup said. ``We must, and will, win
Friday's opening game against the Saudis.''
	   ``A win over Saudi Arabia will give a kick to our
self-confidence,'' Laudrup said. ``We need that after our poor
recent showings.''
	   Denmark lost World Cup warmup games 2-0 against Sweden and
Norway and 2-1 against Cameroon. Of course, Saudi Arabia hasn't
been stellar either, losing 6-0 to Norway in a warmup two weeks
ago.
	   ``I don't expect a `goal-rich' World Cup match in Lens,''
defender Jes Hoegh said. ``We'll get a narrow 1-0 win or maybe a
2-0. We are well-prepared. We're having a good time here.''
	   Denmark and Saudi Arabia both are making their second
appearances in the World Cup finals.
	   The countries reached the last 16 in their previous visits to
the finals, Denmark in 1986 and Saudi Arabia in 1994.
	   The teams have met once before, in 1995, and Denmark won 2-0.
	   Denmark hasn't announced its lineup, but Brondby's Ebbe Sand,
top scorer in the Danish league last season with 28 goals, looks
likely to partner star striker Laudrup.
	   Sand's only previous appearance for Denmark was in the recent
defeat by Norway.
	   Sand is similar in style to Preben Elkjaer-Larsen, the powerful
striker who scored 38 times in 69 matches for Denmark during the
1980s.
	   Saudi Arabia manager Carlos Alberto Parreira, leading his record
fourth different country at the World Cup, is expecting a tough
encounter.
	   ``The Danes play all of their (soccer) in Europe, so they have
the upper hand,'' Parreira said. ``Saudi Arabia plays in Asia so
they lack experience at the top level.''
	   Parriera, who coached Brazil to the world title four years ago,
said the Danes' biggest advantage is their physical presence,
adding that much of his team's training has centered on improving
its strength.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ More than 3,000 people jammed the harbor
in the capital of Guinea-Bissau on Thursday hoping to flee the West
African nation before government forces moved to crush a rebellion
led by renegade soldiers, according to news reports.
	   Over 1,000 foreigners jostled with locals for a place on a
Portuguese merchant ship that was to evacuate people to Dakar in
neighboring Senegal, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reporter.
	   A Chinese merchant ship evacuated 53 Russians and other
nationals from the former Soviet Union, including 29 embassy staff
and their families, the Interfax news agency reported, citing a
Russian Foreign Ministry official.
	   Telephone contact with officials in Guinea-Bissau was not
immediately possible. Officials in Lisbon said they had no details
of how the evacuation was proceeding.
	   Senegal closed its southern border with Guinea-Bissau, Lusa
reported, though no reason was given for the move.
	   A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bissau said there was
``significant fighting going on'' while the evacuation took place.

	   The Buenos Aires case is not over and investigations must be
continued, ``not just to placate the commission but to do
justice,'' said the head of Mexico City's human rights commission
on Wednesday.
	   Luis de la Barreda Solorzano said the case involving the Sept. 8
disappearance of six youths in the lower-class Buenos Aires
neighborhood is still open.
	   Judicial authorities must move quickly so all guilty parties are
prosecuted and held responsible, he said at a forum on ``Ethnicity,
Race, Gender and Human Rights.''
	   De la Barreda's comments come as authorities are making their
case against a top cop, whose office oversaw the since-disbanded
Zorro and Jaguar units - the specialized teams that were dismantled
after being blamed for the Buenos Aires killings.
	   Mauro Enrique Tello Quinones, then-director of special police
units and the number three man on the force at the time, was
detained this week at Mexico City's Eastern Penitentiary and
charged with ordering the disappearance of the bodies. His arrest
comes as advocates and mothers of the killed young men petition
authorities to arrest former Federal District Police Chief Enrique
Salgado Cordero and other top officials they say were involved in
the slayings.
	   Wednesday Tello Quinones denied having participated in the
Buenos Aires killings.
	   ``I did not order any execution, kidnapping, nor anything of
that style, because up until now I know nothing.
	   ``Of the supposed victims, I know nothing, nor of their
families,'' he said from behind bars.
	   The Buenos Aires killings seemed to be police revenge for a gun
battle that erupted between cops and some neighborhood criminals
following a police sweep. In the shoot-out, a civilian and a police
officer were killed. Shortly after, police were seen rustling six
young men into squad cars. Their bodies turned up days later with
bullet holes and signs of torture.
	   Tello Quinones did admit to a city judge this week that Salgado
Cordero did order him to participate in the police sweep, which he
conducted with Motorcycle Division patrolman Col. Jesus Alonso
Valdes and then-Jaguares head Moctezuma Ilhuicamina Zepeda.
	   While speaking to reporters at Mexico City's Eastern
Penitentiary where he is detained, the 52-year-old Tello Quinones
had to pause as mothers shouted behind him.
	   ``Look what they did to my child!'' yelled one woman, showing a
photograph of her son's remains.
	   ``You destroyed the life, and now you are saying that you are
not at fault. Also we want Felipe Bonilla Espinobarros and
Salgado,'' said the woman.
	   Tello Quinones was detained Monday night and handed over to
Federal District Judicial Police. An arrest warrant had been signed
on Friday.

Israeli jets raid south Lebanon after allied militiaman killed

responsibility for missile attack &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes struck suspected
guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon Thursday shortly after
guerrillas killed an Israeli-allied militiaman and wounded another,
security officials said.
	   Two Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface missiles at a valley
near the town of Joun, 15 kilometers (9 miles) north of the
Christian town of Jezzine, the scene of the guerrilla attack.
	   Black smoke billowed from the targeted area. There was no
immediate word on casualties from the attack.
	   Lebanese army anti-aircraft gunners opened fire on the raiding
jets, but missed, the Lebanese officials said, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   The attack came less than three hours after guerrillas shot an
anti-tank missile at a vehicle carrying members of an
Israeli-allied militia, killing one militiaman and wounding
another, security officials said.
	   The vehicle of the South Lebanon Army militia was hit by a
Sagger missile as it was traveling on a mountain road near Jezzine,
the Lebanese officials said.
	   One militiaman was killed instantly and another was moderately
wounded in the attack, the officials said.
	   Jezzine, which is controlled by the militia, is 20 kilometers
(12.5 miles) north of Marjayoun, the main town in an
Israeli-occupied border enclave in south Lebanon.
	   Militia officials confirmed the two casualties, but declined to
give their names or ranks. The 2,500-strong militia is funded,
trained and equipped by Israel.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group claimed
responsibility for the attack.
	   In a statement issued in Sidon, provincial capital of southern
Lebanon, the fundamentalist Shiite Muslim group said its guerrillas
ambushed a militia convoy, killing a militia official and wounding
three other fighters.
	   There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy in the
number of wounded militiamen.
	   Hezbollah, or Party of God, has in the past targeted Israeli
troops and their allied militiamen with missiles and roadside bombs
as part of a war of attrition to oust them from the occupied zone.
	   Israel has controlled the zone, about 10 percent of Lebanese
territory, since 1985 to guard its northern towns from cross-border
attacks.

Year of Tiger becomes Year of Recession for Asia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Graphic ASIA RECESSIONS &QL;

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Year of the Tiger, according
to Chinese superstition, can bring ferocious upheaval.
	   Six months into this tiger year, the once roaring Asian
economies have experienced plenty of that. Several have fallen
deeper into recession, a half dozen are slumping in that direction.
	   With Japan expected to announce Friday its first quarter of
negative growth in two decades, the deflation of Asia's economic
role model could push its proteges over the edge.
	   ``The announcement will have a negative impact,'' said Rajeev
Malik, regional economist at Jardine Fleming International
Securities in Singapore. ``I think the most immediate is likely to
be felt in the currency markets.''
	   Tokyo's announcement will come in the wake of Wednesday's
sell-off in Asian stock markets and currency markets, which plunged
after the U.S. dollar climbed to a seven-year high against the
bellwether yen.
	   Economic confidence in Asia generally suffers when the yen takes
a beating, even though regional currencies may not be directly
pegged to it.
	   The first of the Asian dominoes to fall, Thailand has been in
recession since last year, when its economy shrank by 0.4 percent,
compared to 5.5 percent growth in 1996.
	   Next was Indonesia, also in full-blown recession. Before the
deadly student riots last month that led to the fall of President
Suharto, analysts were already predicting an economic contraction
of 10 percent. Some are now forecasting negative growth of 25
percent this year.
	   Market analysts also put South Korea in recession. The Korean
economy is expected to shrink by more than 1 percent this year,
which would be the first contraction since 1980.
	   Hong Kong's economy eroded by 2 percent in the quarter ending in
March, the first negative growth in 13 years.
	   Malaysia and Singapore are both denying they're headed toward
recession, if you go by the standard definition of a recession: two
consecutive quarters of contracting growth.
	   Some economists say you can't always use this yardstick because
the growth rates in some countries, such as Malaysia, have been so
high.
	   ``When your economy slows down from 8 percent to 1 or 2 percent
that is, for all practical purposes, a recession,'' Malik said.
	   Malaysia's central bank announced last month that gross domestic
product shrank by 1.8 percent in the first quarter, the first
quarterly contraction since the mid-1980s.
	   Chia Yew Boon, research director at Singapore-based Santander
Investment Securities, said a policy split within government has
created uncertainty that is hurting Malaysia's chances of quick
recovery. Chia expects the economy to shrink by 3.8 percent this
year, compared with economic growth of 7.8 percent in 1997.
	   While Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has called loudly for
lower interest rates to help troubled businesses, the central bank
and Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who is also finance
minister, are adamant about keeping interest rates at current
levels.
	   Bruce Gale, regional manager of the Hong Kong-based Political &AMP;
Economic Risk Consultancy, said the expected announcement by
Tokyo's Economic Planning Agency on Friday could badly bruise
Singapore and Malaysia.
	   ``Malaysia's been very much looking to Japan to be a leader in
the region and to help Malaysia out with some of its short-term
financing,'' Gale said.
	   Mahathir returned last Friday from Tokyo and said he expected to
get dlrs 1-2 billion worth of loans in yen, a prospect made less
likely if Japan tightens its financial belt.
	   Singapore's growth for the first quarter of 1998 was 5.6
percent, but the figure is considered artificial because the first
quarter of 1997 was unusually depressed.
	   ``Singapore is highly vulnerable despite its good economic
management,'' said Gale. ``It's extremely vulnerable to a downturn
in trade, which is going to result from the negative growth in
Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand.''
	   The Philippines has escaped the worst of the Asian crisis.
Though economic growth slowed this first quarter to 2.5 percent
from 5.4 percent, no recession is expected.
	   Bitter enemies China and Taiwan have also stayed afloat amid the
sinking economies. Taiwan is predicting GDP growth of 6 percent
this year, down only 0.8 percent from last year.
	   China's Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng said Tuesday that
currency devaluations in Southeast Asian countries had weakened the
competitiveness of China's exports, but that China hoped to
maintain its 8-percent growth prediction for the year.
	   Economist Malik doesn't believe the smaller Asian economies can
do much to save themselves. He believes they need a comprehensive
debt-relief package similar to that in Latin America in the 1980s.
	   ``Debt forgiveness is what these countries need,'' he said.
``Short of insuring transparency and eliminating policy
contradictions, there is very little these countries can do on
their own.''

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Striking teachers clashed with police
outside schools around Greece on Thursday, leaving at least 13
people injured, media said.
	   The strikers were protesting new examinations introduced for
qualified teachers who wish to be appointed to state-run schools.
They say their university degrees should be the only qualification
necessary.
	   Under the previous system, teachers had to wait for years before
they received a state job.
	   They began a 48-hour strike to coincide with the start of
examinations on Friday, and have attempted to occupy schools where
they are set to take place in an effort to disrupt the tests.
	   Thirteen people, 10 of them police officers, were injured during
clashes outside numerous Athens schools, where riot squads used
tear gas to disperse protesters hurling stones, authorities said.
Ten demonstrators were arrested.
	   ``We condemn this small group of teachers who ... are acting in
a manner which is violent, lawless, ... against their colleagues
who have expressed an interest in participating in the examinations
in question,'' said government spokesman Dimitris Reppas.
	   ``I believe the majority of teachers have nothing to do with
such behavior and cannot support it,'' he added.
	   At least 10 cars were reportedly damaged during the clashes,
which spilled over into nearby streets, local media reported.
	   Clashes between teachers and riot police also occurred in the
northern port city of Salonica, as well as in the town of
Alexandroupolis, 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the Turkish border,
and in other Greek towns, media said.

	   K&AMP;N Kenanga Holdings Bhd has formalised its partnership with
Rothschild Asset Management International Holdings BV with the
setting up of a 60:40 joint venture foreign fund management
company.
	   Applications have been made to the Securities Commission for the
necessary approvals, after which the joint venture will offer fund
management services to institutional and retail clients in
Malaysia.
	   The joint venture - Kenanga Investment Management Sdn Bhd - will
also look into the setting up of a unit trust subsidiary, Kenanga
Unit Trust Bhd, to launch a unit trust scheme by the year-end to
invest in Malaysian equities.
	   This joint venture will also provide expertise to another
subsidiary of K&AMP;N Kenanga set up earlier this year, Kenanga Asset
Management Sdn Bhd, which manages about RM20 million in funds for
corporate and individual clients.
	   At a Press briefing in Kuala Lumpur yesterday, Rothschild Asset
Management (Singapore) Ltd managing director Jill Smith said the
venture will seek to leverage off existing Malaysian clients of
Rothschild.
	   ``We will seek to persuade our existing Malaysian clients to
place any additional funds via this new joint venture.''
	   K&AMP;N Kenanga executive director Abdul Aziz Hashim said the tie-up
will help broaden the expertise base for the company in fund
management services.
	   Currently, another foreign financial group Deutsche Morgan

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia warned Thursday it would
not tolerate any NATO actions on its territory, reacting to the
alliance's decision to deploy air power in an attempt to end
fighting in Serbia's secessionist Kosovo province.
	   The warning from Ivica Dacic, spokesman for the ruling
Socialists of President Slobodan Milosevic, came as NATO defense
ministers decided to stage simulated air raids and bombing runs
over neighboring Albania and Macedonia to halt further military
action by Yugoslav forces.
	   ``We are a sovereign country and without our consent, no actions
of any international alliance can be carried out on our territory _
especially since there is no reason for it,'' said Dacic, the
independent FoNet news agency reported.
	   In Kosovo, a prominent ethnic Albanian leader, Adem Demaci,
welcomed the NATO decision as ``the best and most economical way of
teaching the Serb regime a lesson.'' A direct air threat is much
more effective than ground troops on Kosovo's borders, he said.
	   After an apparent lull over the past 24 hours, both sides
reported fighting in Kosovo Thursday.
	   NATO and other western officials, are increasingly worried that
a lack of action in Yugoslavia _ consisting of Serbia and
Montenegro _ will send violence spiraling out of control in the
southern Balkans, dragging neighboring countries into the conflict
that has killed more than 250 people since March and forced tens of
thousands to flee their homes.
	   Yugoslavia does not threaten regional stability or peace, and
its forces are defending ``territorial integrity ... from terrorist
actions,'' Dacic said, reiterating that Yugoslavia will not give up
any territory.
	   The West, too, has denied the Kosovo Albanians' demand for
independence from Serbia. But NATO warned Milosevic should not
ignore its warnings of military strikes.
	   Dacic denied allegations of ethnic cleansing against Kosovo
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the province's population.
	   Serbian ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj said NATO threats of
action in Kosovo were ``programmed for psychological reasons,'' but
``a real danger should not be excluded,'' FoNet reported.
	   In the province, the Kosovo Information Center, close to the
ethnic Albanian leadership, claimed the Serb army was using heavy
artillery to shell villages near the border with Albanian in the
west of the province. The report could not be independently
confirmed.
	   Milosevic has ruled Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority with
repression, since stripping the province of broad autonomy in 1989.
Last March, Serbian forces launched a crackdown on militants of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, prompting daily skirmishes between the
government and the rebels.
	   Associated Press reporter Brian Murphy, in the border village of
Tropoja in Albania Thursday, saw a large convoy of mules loaded
with arms and other supplies, accompanied by some 100 armed
fighters, moving toward the mountains and the border with Kosovo.
	   Tony Lloyd, No. 2 in Britain's Foreign Office, met Albanian
leaders in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, and afterwards urged both
secessionists and Serbian authorities to compromise.
	   Lloyd blamed the government for most of the violence, but said
``our condemnation is equally about violence by the KLA in
Kosovo.''
	   Talks between the sides began last month under Western pressure,
but were suspended last week as the Albanians protested a Serbian
government offensive in western Kosovo.
	   Tanjug, the Yugoslav state news agency, said NATO should
pressure Kosovo's Albanian leaders to continue the talks, and
``take a serious look'' at Albania, which it called the source of
arms and training for the militants.
	   Russia, a traditional ally of fellow Orthodox Slavs in Serbia,
has invited Milosevic to visit Moscow next Monday and Tuesday,
Tanjug said without elaboration.
	   In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross launched
an appeal for 3.2 million Swiss francs (dlrs 2.2 million) to meet
refugees' food needs for four months, the group said in a
statement.

Canadian dollar sets new all-time trading low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ The Canadian dollar fell Thursday to an all-time
trading low of 60.03 U.S. cents.
	   The previous low, set Jan. 29, was 68.10 cents.
	   The Canadian currency has been weak for months because of the
negative impact of the Asian financial crisis on some Canadian
commodity exports. Canada's central bank has resisted raising
interest rates to protect the currency.
	   The weak dollar has been an annoyance for Canadians traveling to
the United States, but it has attracted U.S. bargain-hunters to
Canada and has helped some Canadian firms by making their exports
more affordable for U.S. buyers.

	   IPOH, Wed. - Two women, shocked with their excessively high
water bills, took their woes to the State MCA Complaints Bureau as
the last resort.
	   Housewife Foo Kwai Lan, 64, said she was upset after being
notified by the Perak Water Board recently that the water supply to
her house in Pasir Pinji would be disconnected if she did not pay
up her water bill amounting to RM1,613.
	   ``I was shocked when I received the bill for water used between
Dec 3, last year and Feb 5, this year when my previous bills
averaged only RM13 a month.'' She claimed that the Board had turned
a deaf ear to her complaints when she appealed to it to investigate
the matter several months ago.
	   She believes that the problem could have started after the
replacement of an old meter in her house in December.
	   A technician from the Board told her son Ng Kong Chye, that
there was a possibility of leakage in the underground pipe but he
did not carry out any check at her house.
	   Meanwhile, coffee shop operator Teh Lian Peng, 50, who runs a
shop in Jalan Yang Kalsom, said she had been paying her water bills
regularly but recently received a notice asking her to pay a total
of RM1,499.60.
	   She was puzzled as to why she had to pay the amount despite
having settled her bills regularly on time.
	   Following their complaints, the State MCA Complaints Bureau
vice- chairman and city councillor Gooi Seng Teik urged the board
to set up a special unit to investigate such complaints.

Truth probe reveals apartheid horror of science gone mad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: (AMs) RECASTS; ADDS quotes from Desmond Tutu, further
testimony, background &QL;

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Casting light into the murkiest
corners of the apartheid state and the human psyche, a panel
probing human rights abuses is revealing a world of science gone
mad.
	   Holding the first-ever hearings on the apartheid-era
government's secret biological and chemical weapons program, the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission has been listening this week to
scientists describe making poisoned chocolates, hatching plots to
give Nelson Mandela brain damage and trying to find a germ-warfare
agent that would kill only blacks.
	   Ethical standards were abandoned as researchers tried to develop
lethal, untraceable poisons and an anti-fertility drug aimed at the
country's black population.
	   The army scientists explained that they were virtually
brain-washed by government propaganda in the 1980s that South
Africa was on the brink of falling to communism and black rule.
They testified they were willing to stop at almost nothing to
defend white power.
	   ``That was the psychosis that prevailed,'' Daan Goosen, who
headed a covert biological research laboratory, recalled Thursday.
	   ``I was not thinking rationally at the time,'' Goosen continued.
``Today I know I was wrong. You can't do that to people, it is just
not justifiable.''
	   Retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu said this week's testimony was
the most shocking he has heard as chairman of the Truth Commission,
set up in 1995 to heal racial divisions.
	   ``Here are people of high intelligence, coldly and clinically in
white laboratory coats, working on things they know were meant to
be instruments of destroying people,'' Tutu told The Associated
Press.
	   One researcher, Andre Immelman, kept freeze-dried supplies of
deadly cholera and anthrax in a small refrigerator locked in his
office safe. The amounts were enough to cause major epidemics.
	   Scientists who had any doubts about their work faced possible
assassination if they broke ranks, claimed scientist Schalk van
Rensburg.
	   ``We had been told in no uncertain terms, if you let the side
down you are dead,'' van Rensburg said.
	   Unlike many policemen, soldiers and black liberation fighters
who have told the Truth Commission of their crimes, the men who
appearing this week were educated at top universities and dedicated
their lives to science.
	   Run through front companies, the biological and chemical weapons
program was controlled by Dr. Wouter Basson. He had not testified
yet because his lawyers fear he may prejudice his upcoming court
case on charges he had a sideline business going, making the drugs
mandrax and ectasy and selling them.
	   However, Goosen gave some insight into Basson's mindset. The
scientist recalled having tea and biscuits with Basson during a
break from their deadly research.
	   ``One day the black people people will take over this country.
When my daughter asks me `Daddy, what did you do to prevent this,'
my conscience will be clear,'' Basson said, according to the
testimony.
	   Van Rensburg described plans to poison Mandela, before he became
president, with thallium to damage his brain. There was no
suggestion the plan was ever carried out.
	   The African National Congress, which won the country's first
all-race elections in 1994 that marked the end of apartheid,
compares the former apartheid government's activities with Adolf
Hitler's Third Reich. The Nazi government used scientists to devise
ways of exterminating millions of Jews, Gypsies and others.
	   The Truth Commission can grant amnesty to those who fully
confess to politically motivated apartheid-era human rights abuses.

Prosecutors start legal action against Turkey's wandering deputy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ It may be the last time that Turkey's
itchy footed lawmaker changes parties. Then again, it may not.
	   Prosecutors on Thursday opened an investigation into deputy
Kubilay Uygun on charges of making a mockery of the Parliament by
switching parties six times in two years.
	   Uygun was elected in 1995 on the Democratic Left Party ticket. A
year later, he moved to former premier Tansu Ciller's center-right
True Path Party.
	   Four days later, he resigned and went back to the Democratic
Left, where he remained for 22 days before going back to True Path.
	   Just 13 days later, he joined the far-right Nationalist Movement
Party. Then, a month later, he hooked up with another center-right
party, the Democratic Turkey Party.
	   On Wednesday, he resigned from Democratic Turkey.
	   ``He is making fun of our Parliament and of the people who
elected him,'' said Cevat Balta, the lawyer who persuaded
prosecutors to open the investigation.
	   The law on contempt of Parliament provides for prison terms of
from six months to a year. But there's a catch: as a deputy, Uygun
enjoys immunity from prosecution.
	   Only parliament itself can lift his immunity.

	   WITH the deliberate intention of breaking away from the norm, a
group of former students of Convent Bukit Nenas decided to have
their get-together at the Lifestyle Karaoke Lounge of Holiday Villa
Subang Jaya recently.
	   The Class of '86 students let their hair down and had a whale of
a time at the function.
	   Organising committee chairman Syirin Zarina said it was the
second meeting since the last one held two years ago.
	   ``We have about 120 ex-students from the 1986 batch but we only
managed to get in touch with about 90.
	   ``We felt this number was good enough to call for a party,''
Syirin said.
	   She said the main aim of the get-together was to keep in touch
with each other and to build a business network.
	   ``Our Old Girls are holding high posts in the various business
fraternity and the meeting will offer an excellent opportunity to
meet and discuss possible avenues for business expansion,'' Syirin
said.

Strike set to cripple air traffic in Norway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Air traffic controllers and other key
personnel were set to strike on Friday in a conflict that would
ground most of Norway's air traffic and leave thousands of
passengers stranded or facing grueling bus rides to alternate
airports.
	   The Norwegian Academics Union planned to step up a two-week
strike by ordering air traffic controllers and other essential
aviation workers to walk off the job Friday in support of the
union's pay demands.
	   A strike by 231 air traffic controllers would stop virtually all
air traffic in southern Norway, and could force airlines to bus
international passengers hundreds of kilometers (miles) to airports
in neighboring Sweden.
	   ``Normally we have about 25,000 passengers on a weekend. We
expect about 20,000 of them to be affected one way or another by a
strike,'' said Audun Tjomsland, spokesman for the Norwegian airline
Braathens.
	   The union ordered a strike on May 28 after rejecting pay raises
of about six percent offered to its members employed in the public
sector. It has slowly stepped up the strike to its current level of
3,800 people.
	   The government on Wednesday ordered about 1,100 nurses organized
by the union to return to work, saying the strike threatened public
health. The union refused to respect the order until it is made law
by parliament, probably next week.
	   Those expected to strike Friday include technicians needed to
keep Norway's main air traffic control center operating. Equipment
failure there could ground virtually all traffic in the country,
the Civil Aviation Administration said in a statement.
	   However, the Norwegian news agency NTB predicted that a strike
crippling air traffic would be short-lived, since the government
was likely to order strikers back to work through binding
arbitration.
	   Norway depends heavily on air traffic, since the country is
about 1,700 kilometers (1,050 miles) long, much of it long fjords
and mountains.

Ten tons of trash removed from El Yunque rainforest reserve
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Some 200 volunteers collected more
than 10 tons of trash in a cleanup day at El Yunque rainforest
reserve Saturday, the U.S. Forest Service said.
	   In a press release issued Thursday, the Forest Service said the
garbage was collected by organizations and individuals, as well as
municipal personnel from the towns around El Yunque, officially
known as the Caribbean National Forest.
	   Most of the trash was collected along the rivers and roads in
the park.
	   ``We urge the citizens not to use these areas as dumps,'' the
Forest Service said in the statement. ``This can influence the
deterioration of our bodies of water and increase pollution.''
	   El Yunque is the only tropical rainforest in the U.S. National
Parks system and is visited by more than 30,000 people each year.

	   SAPURA Systems (M) Sdn Bhd (SSM), a member of the Sapura Group,
believes it can obtain more revenue contribution from the
information storage market for the coming year. SSM, which is the
local distributor of ATL's digital linear tape (DLT) libraries,
also expects to increase its market share by 100 per cent.
	   SSM's marketing manager Wan Ahmad Kamal said efforts would be
made to raise awareness among corporate users on the importance of
proper information storage within their organisations.
	   The company plans to conduct aggressive indirect marketing
activities through its 35 channel partners nationwide.
	   ``On top of that, we have also directly planned to market these
products by conducting roadshows and other joint events with ATL,''
Wan Ahmad said.
	   SSM, he added, will also leverage on its regional and
local-based advertisements in an effort to increase its revenue in
the information storage market.
	   Wan Ahmad was speaking to reporters at a Press conference held
in Kuala Lumpur last week in conjunction with the launch of ATL's
latest range of information storage products. The products are the
P1000, P3000, PowerStor L500 libraries and the PL50 Library Hub,
which are developed using the Prism architecture.
	   At the same event, ATL's regional general manager for
Asia-Pacific Graham Timm said Prism is a new library architecture
that seeks to shatter the constraints of the conventional approach
to storage performance, and thus redefines the library system
design. By incorporating a cost- effective, high-performance
peripheral component interconnect (PCI) expansion bus into
automated tape systems, the Prism architecture has reached a
pinnacle in open systems design.
	   ``By harnessing the power of high-speed PCI adapter cards, the
Prism libraries can be upgraded by adding library building blocks.
The upgrade enables network and fibre connectivity and provides
capability to embed servers and functionality such as tape
mirroring and auto tape copy,'' Timm said.
	   He added that libraries which utilise the Prism technology are
compatible with all Unix and Windows NT environments.
	   ``Its support of open system storage management provides a high
degree of flexibility and compatibility to the end users in
ensuring that their investments are protected.''
	   The P1000 provides the capability of supporting up to four DLT
4000 or DLT-7000 drives and 30 DLT cartridges for 72 gigabytes (GB)
per hour performance. It also allows cost-effective expansion by
adding only drives and cartridge slots, thus eliminating the need
to buy a new library.
	   Targeted at storage-intensive applications, the P3000 features
up to 16 DLT drives and 332 cartridges for 288GB per hour
performance. The high availability design features hot-swap DLT
drives, power supplies, fans and AC sources.
	   The PowerStor L500 meanwhile is targeted at small to
medium-sized industries (SMIs). It supports up to three DLT drives
and 14 DLT cartridges and delivers 54GB per hour back-up
performance.
	   The PL50 Library Hub presents a virtual library to three
heterogeneous back-up servers by allowing a user to assign a
cartridge slot and drive partitions. It is equipped with four small
computer systems interface (SCSI) ports, a monitor and advanced
library hub software, Timm said.

Truth probe reveals apartheid horror of science gone mad

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Casting light into the murkiest
corners of the apartheid state and the human psyche, a panel
probing human rights abuses is revealing a world of science gone
mad.
	   Holding the first-ever hearings on the apartheid-era
government's secret biological and chemical weapons program, the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission has been listening this week to
scientists describe making poisoned chocolates, hatching plots to
give Nelson Mandela brain damage and trying to find a germ-warfare
agent that would kill only blacks.
	   Ethical standards were abandoned as researchers tried to develop
lethal, untraceable poisons and an anti-fertility drug aimed at the
country's black population.
	   The army scientists explained that they were virtually
brain-washed by government propaganda in the 1980s that South
Africa was on the brink of falling to communism and black rule.
They testified they were willing to stop at almost nothing to
defend white power.
	   ``That was the psychosis that prevailed,'' Daan Goosen, who
headed a covert biological research laboratory, recalled Thursday.
	   ``I was not thinking rationally at the time,'' Goosen continued.
``Today I know I was wrong. You can't do that to people, it is just
not justifiable.''
	   Retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu said this week's testimony was
the most shocking he has heard as chairman of the Truth Commission,
set up in 1995 to heal racial divisions.
	   ``Here are people of high intelligence, coldly and clinically in
white laboratory coats, working on things they know were meant to
be instruments of destroying people,'' Tutu told The Associated
Press.
	   One researcher, Andre Immelman, kept freeze-dried supplies of
deadly cholera and anthrax in a small refrigerator locked in his
office safe. The amounts were enough to cause major epidemics.
	   The scientists said they supplied apartheid hit squads with
poisoned drinks and cigarettes. Any who had doubts about their work
faced possible assassination if they broke ranks, claimed scientist
Schalk van Rensburg.

Srebrenica women visit their family graves for the first time

<TEXT>
	   SREBRENICA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ For the first time since
the war ended in Bosnia, expelled Muslim women from Srebrenica
visited Thursday their family graves in this eastern Bosnian town.
	   Escorted by peacekeepers and cordoned-off by Bosnian Serb police
from jeering Serb bystanders on sidewalks, two busloads of women
headed straight for the grave site at Kazan cemetery in Srebrenica.
	   In one of the worst incidents of ethnic cleansing in the Bosnian
war, Bosnian Serb troops overran the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica
in eastern Bosnia in summer of 1996. Those who managed fled, but
thousands of Muslim men have been missing since and are believed to
have been massacred by the Serbs.
	   No incidents were reported on Thursday, even though a crowd of
some 150 Serbs, today's Srebrenica residents, raised the
nationalist Serb three-finger sign and a radio, blasting
traditional Serb songs, was turned on maximum volume as the Muslim
women passed by.
	   The women spent about two hours tending their family graves
under the protection of Larry Sampler, the international official
imposed as Srebrenica local authority by top international mediator
Carlos Westendorp.
	   Sampler was put in charge following an unsettled dispute on who
should rule the town between the Serb community living at present
in Srebrenica and its expelled Muslim population which won the
majority of seats in local elections.
	   Shortly afterward, the women returned to Tuzla in Muslim-Croat
federation territory.
	   Sampler told Associated Press Television the Srebrenica women's
visit to their hometown was ``an act of courage,'' affirming they
had organized the journey themselves. He also thanked the Bosnian
Serb police for help in keeping the situation under control.
	   Hesitant to speak to reporters, one Srebrenica woman gave only
her fist name, Fatima, saying it was a ``very difficult day for
me.''
	   ``I have lost everything but I understand some of the (Serb)
people here have lost everything, too,'' Fatima said.

Editor of biggest opposition paper resigns, joins state-owned
</HEADLINE>
weekly

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The editor of Egypt's biggest opposition
newspaper resigned Thursday after being rebuked by the party behind
the paper, journalists said.
	   The Wafd party had rebuked Gamal Badawi, editor-in-chief of
Al-Wafd, for accepting to be a government appointee to the Shura
Council, Egypt's upper chamber of parliament.
	   Journalists told The Associated Press that Badawi handed his
resignation to Fouad Sarag el-Dinne, the head of Al-Wafd's board of
directors, and was promptly named as an advisor to the government's
weekly newspaper, Akhbar Al-Youm.
	   The journalists, who declined to be identified, said Badawi had
refused to obey the party's order to turn down the nomination for
the Shura.
	   Wafd officials refused to comment.
	   On Sunday, the ruling National Democratic Party won 72 of the 88
seats up for election in the Shura Council's mid-term elections.
	   Egypt's 13 opposition parties, including the Wafd, boycotted the
polls, saying they did not trust them to be fair. The opposition
alleged widespread vote-rigging in the last legislative elections
in 1995.
	   President Hosni Mubarak appoints one-third of the Shura
Council's 264 members.

French court convicts rowdy Scottish soccer fan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French court Thursday convicted a Scottish soccer
fan accused of throwing a beer cans at a French policeman and
sentenced him to a two-month suspended sentence.
	   Christopher Kyles, 23, of Aberdeen, Scotland, apologized to the
court. Speaking through a translator, he admitted being drunk and
remembered none of his actions.
	   Kyles was accused of throwing a beer can at French police on the
Champs Elysees during festivities Tuesday night in Paris that
marked the opening of the World Cup.
	   Late-night clashes between drunken soccer fans, Parisian youths
and riot police left 34 policemen injured during the soccer party.
	   Following his arrest, police seized Kyles' ticket and put him in
jail, preventing Kyles from attending the Brazil-Scotland match on
Wednesday, which his country lost 2-1.
	   Scots have startled many Parisians with their hard drinking and
tendency to lift their kilts, often revealing naked bottoms.

<TEXT>
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Mozambican prosecutors have filed
additional criminal charges, including espionage, against a South
African foreign affairs official held since March on a gun running
charge.
	   Prosecutors have charged Robert McBride with espionage and
membership in a criminal organization, said Albano Silva, a lawyer
for McBride.
	   The new charges apparently came this week after the judge sent
the provisional charge sheet, which accused McBride of gun running,
back to the prosecutor with a request for more definitive charges.
	   The judge must now rule whether there is sufficient evidence for
trial.
	   Mozambican law provides for a maximum sentence of 20 years in
prison for espionage and 12 years for gun running.
	   The case is major news in South Africa, where the government has
remained mostly silent but has said McBride was not on official
business in Mozambique at the time of his arrest.
	   Within two weeks of McBride's arrest in Mozambique, a
controversial report from South Africa's military alleged that he
and others were involved in planning a coup against South Africa's
ruling African National Congress government.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela denied the veracity of
the report that led to the resignation of Defense Force Commander
Georg Meiring.
	   McBride, a former guerrilla fighter, was convicted in the 1986
bombing of a Durban bar that killed three women. He was freed under
a 1992 amnesty negotiated by the ANC and the then-governing
National Party.
	   Mandela's ex-wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, is expected to
travel on Friday to Mozambique to intervene on McBride's behalf.

U.N. refugee chief calls for end to Kosovo violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo, NATO-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United Nations refugee chief issued an appeal
Thursday to all sides immediately to put ``an end to the cycle of
violence'' in the explosive Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
	   Further displacement of refugees ``could destabilize the entire
region,'' U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata said in
a statement.
	   UNHCR estimates that some 12,000 refugees have already fled
across mountains from Kosovo into northern Albania to escape the
latest outbreak of fighting.
	   Altogether, ``around 65,000 people have been forced to flee
their homes in Kosovo'' since March, Ogata said.
	   Some 8,000 have fled to the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro and
others, estimated at 45,000, have fled to other parts of Kosovo.
	   ``Nobody wants another Bosnia,'' Ogata added. UNHCR is still
working to ``solve the situation'' of some 1.8 million people
displaced from the Bosnian and Croatian conflicts.
	   Ogata said she is ``worried about some 13,000 refugees, mainly
Serbs from Croatia, staying in Kosovo, some of whom have had to
flee once again.''
	   She appealed for international support of Albania's efforts to
deal with the influx of refugees.
	   Also Thursday, the international Red Cross launched an appeal
for 3.2 million Swiss francs (dlrs 2.2 million) in aid for the
refugees in northern Albania.
	   The sum is intended to meet their food needs for four months,
and to provide hygiene parcels, blankets and mattresses, baby food
and clothes, a statement said.

IMF said to demand Russian budget cuts, tax reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS thruout, UPDATES with markets closing down,
analyst quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund wants Russia to
adopt a strict austerity plan in exchange for billions of dollars
in new loans, a top Western banking official said Thursday.
	   It's not clear precisely what the IMF is offering, however, or
whether Russia is willing or able to agree to the deal.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was
familiar with a letter from the IMF to the Russian government
outlining its demands: that Russia slash its budget deficit, pass a
tax reform package, break up the Gazprom energy monopoly and be
more open about its statistics and fiscal activities.
	   The Russian government already claims to be pursuing several of
those goals, although it faces resistance in the
Communist-dominated lower house of parliament.
	   Since Russia's financial markets collapsed late last month,
there has been growing speculation that the country is seeking an
additional dlrs 5 billion to dlrs 10 billion in loans from the IMF
or the Group of Eight leading industrial countries.
	   The Russian stock market perked up last week on rumors of an
emergency bailout plan. It has since slumped again, and continued
to sink Thursday, in part on doubts that an IMF bailout is
imminent.
	   The government took two new steps Thursday to raise revenue,
ordering a 5 percent increase in import duties and authorizing
natural gas discounts of up to 30 percent to customers who pay in
cash.
	   The gas discount is aimed at improving the cash balance of
Gazprom, the nation's largest tax delinquent. Gazprom has said it
cannot pay taxes because its customers cannot pay their bills in
cash.
	   The New York Times reported Thursday that the demands presented
by the IMF included cutting the budget deficit nearly in half, from
the current goal of 4.5 percent of gross domestic product to 2.5
percent of GDP. The Western banking official here said he could
confirm the substance of the Times report.
	   He said it wasn't clear how much money the IMF might be willing
to loan Russia. ``No amounts are being talked about,'' he said.
	   The new government of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko has been
moving to cut spending in an effort to further reduce the deficit.
	   The government is also pushing a tax reform package that is
stuck in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament.
	   According to The Times, the IMF wants that measure passed before
the Duma recesses next month.
	   Charles Blitzer, a former head of the World Bank office in
Moscow who now follows Eastern European markets for a U.S.
investment bank in London, said he agreed with the IMF strategy,
but thought it might be pushing too hard.
	   ``It's high time that the Russians start to attack some of their
problems and to do it in a meaningful way,'' he said. But Blitzer
said there was a danger in the IMF making too many demands, or
demands that the Russians were likely to fail to carry out.
	   ``Because if they fail one more time, it may not be a financial
crisis but a financial meltdown,'' he said.

	   DETROIT (AP) _ As expected, Washington's Dale Hunter was an
irritant to the Detroit Red Wings in Game 1. Hunter, known for his
in-your-face style, gave a particularly nasty time to Red Wings
captain Steve Yzerman.
	   ``We didn't have any particular assignments, but I think Hunter
can get under anybody's skin,'' Capitals coach Ron Wilson said.
``In particular, I think he irritated Steve. But Dale is not going
to let this opportunity pass by. At 38-years old, I don't think he
expects to play the next four years in the Finals.''
	   Wilson said there was no way he couldn't use Hunter, anyway.
	   ``All I had to do was turn around and who is over my right
shoulder but Dale Hunter's dad,'' Wilson said. ``So, if I did not
put Dale in, I might have had a beer thrown on me.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; LINEUP CHANGE: &LR;  Washington left wing Todd Krygier, who has been
sidelined with a groin injury suffered in the Buffalo series, will
probably return to the lineup on Thursday night, coach Ron Wilson
said.
	   Krygier skated on Tuesday and Wednesday and he said he feels
good.
	   It will be a homecoming of sorts. Krygier's parents, Roman and
Charlene, live in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. He spent the early part
of his youth in Novi, Mich. before his parents moved to Buffalo.
	   ``We had season tickets to the Sabres, but I still like coming
back here because my parents live here,'' Krygier said. ``It's
good. All of our parents have sacrificed a lot and to let them have
a chance to see us play is great.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BELLOWS BIRTH: &LR;  Washington Capitals forward Brian Bellows took
a jet home to Minnesota after Game 1 to be with his wife, Tracy,
when she delivered a son. The 7 pound, 1/2 ounce (3.32 kilos) boy
was born Wednesday afternoon in Edina, Minnesota.
	   Bellows returned to Detroit Wednesday night.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; ZZZZ TIME: &LR;  Ron Wilson could not say enough good things about
rookie Richard Zednik, who scored the Caps lone goal in Game 1.
	   ``He is just a fun loving kid and he goes out there and he is
very relaxed,'' Wilson said. ``He is not intimidated by this
atmosphere at all. He is a new breed of European player, who comes
over as a youngster and plays junior hockey and isn't intimidated
by any stretch of the imagination with the surroundings.
	   Zednik's seven goals are tied for the team lead in the playoffs
with defenseman Sergei Gonchar.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; REPUTATION: &LR;  Joe Kocur, who made his NHL reputation mostly with
his fists, was out of hockey but living in Detroit when the Red
Wings signed him as a free agent a year ago. Detroit coach Scotty
Bowman admits he didn't know what he was getting.
	   ``I didn't know much about Joey,'' Bowman said. ``I never knew
what kind of player he was, just sort of the reputation that goes
around. He is really a smart player. He knows how to play hockey.
	   ``That sounds strange, but he has really got a big sense for the
game.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; STAY RELAXED: &LR;  Capitals goalie Olaf Kolzig looks like a poster
boy for cool. But looks can be deceiving. Kolzig says he has to
work hard to stay relaxed.
	   ``I'm always going to get nervous, but as long as I can vent,
I'll be fine,'' said Kolzig, who faced 31 shots in a 2-1 loss in
Game 1. ``My venting takes different forms. Sometimes it's yelling
an obscenity. Sometimes it's breaking a stick.
	   ``I don't take anything home with me. It all stays at the
rink.''

West counting on Russia to help ease crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The withdrawal of Serb forces, the return home of
displaced persons and a return to the negotiating table are
measures to be considered Friday by ministers of the Group of Eight
trying to end the conflict in Kosovo, according to the French
Foreign Ministry.
	   Russia plays a key role in the persuasion effort aimed at
convincing Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to turn around the
crisis in Yugoslavia's province, ministry spokesman Anne
Gazeau-Secret said Thursday.
	   ``We're counting on Russian authorities to use all their
influence to convince Mr. Milosevic to accept these measures and a
return to the negotiating table to discuss a substantial autonomy
status,'' Gazeau-Secret said at a daily briefing.
	   Milosevic will travel to Moscow on Monday to meet with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, the Russian presidential press service
said Thursday.
	   Foreign ministers of the Group of Eight, representing the
world's most industrialized nations that includes Russia, were
meeting Friday in London to consider a package of measures worked
out Wednesday in Paris by the so-called Contact Group.
	   Everyone agreed urgent measures are needed given ``the extreme
seriousness of the crisis,'' Gazeau-Secret said. ``The gamut of
options is being studied on the political as well as the military
side,'' she added.
	   NATO will mount simulated air raids and bombing runs over
Albania and Macedonia in the next few days, alliance defense
ministers decided Thursday.
	   Gazeau-Secret, speaking before the ministers' decision in
Brussels said that were force to be used, France would want the
decision to come from the U.N. Security Council.
	   Without providing specifics, she said the package of political
measures worked out by the Contact Group to go before ministers
Friday aims at a withdrawal of Serb forces, returning displaced
people to their homes and bringing Milosevic to the negotiating
table.
	   Should political persuasion fail, the military option would be
available.
	   ``There will be a very short delay to put these measures into
action,'' she added.
	   Kosovo Albanians are seeking independence from Serbia, part of
Yugoslavia which vows not to allow secession.

Graf wins second match of comeback
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Steffi Graf took just one hour to
beat Kristie Boogert in straight sets Thursday and advance to the
quarterfinals of the DFS Classic.
	   In her second match in four months, the former world No. 1
player dominated the Dutch qualifier 6-2, 6-4 on another
rain-affected day at Edgbaston.
	   The top-seeded Graf, wearing warmup pants on a cold and overcast
day, looked sharper than the previous day when she needed three
sets to beat Australia's Rennae Stubbs.
	   Graf took the first set in 28 minutes with breaks in the third
and seventh games and raced to a 3-0 lead in the second set.
Boogert won three straight games to even the set at 3-3 before Graf
regained command.
	   Graf is playing in only her third tournament since undergoing
knee surgery a year ago. She is preparing for Wimbledon, a
tournament she has won seven times.
	   Second-seeded Irina Spirlea had to wait four days to play her
first match of the tournament but took just 63 minutes to beat
Canada's Maureen Drake 6-4, 6-2 and advance to the third round.

Pagan groups to worship at Stonehenge for first time in 10 years

	   LONDON (AP) _ Stonehenge, the ancient ring of rocks on England's
Salisbury Plain, can once again shed light on the mysteries of the
summer solstice for druids and pagans given access to perform
age-old ceremonies at the site for the first time in 10 years.
	   The English Heritage, the nation's watchdog for historical
monuments, has decided to permit 100 pagan worshipers and members
of the public to watch the sunrise on June 21 from inside
Stonehenge, a spokeswoman for the government-funded body, who
requested anonymity, said Thursday.
	   The area usually is roped off to visitors, who must view the
ancient stone slabs from a distance.
	   The pagan worshipers and others were denied access to the area
during the summer solstice since nine hippies were injured and 70
people arrested following clashes with riot police in 1988. A group
of 4,000 hippies had tried to break police lines to join the
white-robed druids at the site.
	   ''We have been working for many years with interested parties to
look at ways in which we can provide access,'' the English Heritage
spokeswoman said.
	   Stonehenge is a double circle of large stones standing in the
Salisbury Plain about 80 miles (130 km) southwest of London.
Experts dispute its age and origin, but many say it was a center
for pre-Christian and astronomical worship built between 1500 and
2000 B.C.
	   This year, the Arch Druid of Britain, Rollo Maughfling, and a
select few from his order will again perform the traditional summer
solstice druid ceremony that celebrates the symbol of fertility _
the oak tree at the monument.
	   ''It's our most revered site, holiest of holy sites,'' he said.
''We are very pleased that English Heritage new management has
worked out a way that this will be possible now and in the future.
We believe these druid ceremonies are public.''

U.N. drug chief: New chapter opens in campaign against drugs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with UN urging governments to work soon as
possible on key points of UN anti-drug plan, NEW quotes. No pick

 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations urged member states
Thursday to begin work as soon as possible on key elements of a
U.N. plan for combating drugs, including cutting demand by 50
percent and significantly reducing supplies over the next 10 years.
	   The goals were contained in a 31-page plan, adopted Wednesday
night at the end of the U.N. drug summit. It called on governments
to work together to curb trafficking, reduce demand, improve
judicial cooperation, combat money-laundering and reduce the
cultivation of narcotic crops.
	   ``It's time for the member states who have supported our
initiative and have expressed the will to enter into this new phase
... to sit down and discuss how we're going to do this very
ambitious program,'' Sandro Tucci, spokesman for the U.N. Drug
Control Office, said Thursday.
	   Despite the approval, delegates from the 150 countries
represented at the conference were divided about how to wage the
campaign. Leaders of drug-producing countries in Latin America and
Asia said the United States and other consumer nations must reduce
demand.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, who addressed the conference
Monday, announced a dlrs 2 billion media campaign against drugs.
But he refused to endorse one of the pillars of the U.N. program:
financial incentives to persuade Third World farmers to quit
growing narcotic crops.
	   U.N. officials estimate the program will cost more than dlrs 250
million annually for 10 years.
	   Asked about prospects for American funding for the crop
substitution portion, Tucci noted that the U.N. plan includes a
pledge by the conference participants to provide ``the financial
resources necessary to implement the goals which we have
established.''
	   ``We will follow up this by sitting down with all the
governments who have endorsed this plan _ and certainly the United
States has been one of the strongest endorsers of this plan _ and
see how we go about raising the funds which are necessary,'' he
added.
	   After approval of the plan, the head of the U.N. drug office
Pino Arlacchi, said the United Nations was ``not starting a new
`war on drugs,''' a phrase that was ridiculed privately during the
conference by delegates from New Zealand, Latin America and Western
Europe.
	   A better analogy, Arlacchi said, was ``a doctor facing a deadly
disease. Drugs quite simply kill people. And it is our
responsibility to find the cure.''
	   The conference also undescored the broad differences among
nations on the best approach to curbing the worldwide drug
epidemic.
	   Singapore defended its policy of mandatory executions for drug
traffickers. The Netherlands and Switzerland argued their
approaches _ such as tolerating ``soft drugs'' and prescribing
heroin to addicts _ are the best way to curb drug-related crime.
	   ``I wish to repeat this loud and clear here: Switzerland is not
moving toward drug liberalization,'' Swiss Vice President Ruth
Dreifuss said.
	   Dreifuss said Switzerland's controversial program to prescribe
heroin to hardcore addicts had enabled authorities to ``reach
high-dependent drug addicts who had tried other forms of therapy
but without success.''
	   Some private drug research organizations said the United Nations
was focusing too much attention on law enforcement programs, such
as tracing and confiscating drug profits.
	   ``Like the drug war itself, the U.N. drug summit was a
failure,'' said Dr. Ethan Nadelmann, director of the Lindesmith
Center. ``Rather than producing the intended unity, the drug summit
exposed deep divisions ... between drug war zealots who advocate
spending on a failed policy and the reformers who want new
approaches.''

NATO plans to flaunt its power in the face of Milosevic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES throughout with fresh details. CHANGES byline &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO decided Thursday to flaunt its air
power in the face of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic with a
demonstration of allied military fireworks aimed at getting him to
back down in Kosovo.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and his 15 NATO colleagues
approved a package of measures they hoped would convinced Milosevic
to pull back his Serb-led army and police forces in the province
where they have been carrying out escalating attacks on the
ethnic-Albanian majority.
	   ``President Milosevic would be rash and foolish if he would
ignore the message coming from NATO,'' said British Defense
Secretary George Robertson. ``The message is clear and unambiguous
- Belgrade, think again.''
	   Under the measures, NATO will conduct simulated air attacks in
Albania and Macedonia, probably sometime next week, and study
options for further action ranging from accelerated planning for
military exercises in the region to direct air strikes inside
Yugoslavia and use of air mobile ground troops.
	   This is aimed at persuading Milosevic to do three things:
declare a cease-fire in the province; withdraw his forces and end
the repression of the ethnic Albanians; open serious negotiations
with the opposition.
	   ``We will be holding exercises in the region, including
immediately an air exercise which will demonstrate NATO's
capability to rapidly project power into the region,'' said NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said: ``We cannot afford
any longer to focus on hollow solutions of rather symbolic
character like border security missions in Albania or Macedonia.''
	   No one, however, was able to give any assurances that a mere
demonstration of NATO power would be sufficient to stop a Balkan
leader apparently bent on ruthlessly putting down a rebellion in
his own country.
	   ``I don't think anyone can predict what will impress or persuade
Mr. Milosevic,'' said Cohen, adding that a demonstration firepower
would have ``some educational value.''
	   ``We believe very strongly that it will send a signal that there
is not only solidarity of opinion but also the ability to rapidly
deploy forces that could engage in a significant activity in a
short period of time,'' he said.
	   A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the exercises will be carried out in the next few
days and could include simulated bombing raids by NATO planes and
rocket attacks by helicopters. Details were still being worked out.
	   ``This is the threat of force to back up diplomacy,'' said
Robertson. ``Just as it was in the (Persian) Gulf, so it is in
Kosovo.''
	   Added French Defense Minister Alain Richard: ``We can't let the
protagonists believe that we are prepared to stop at a certain
stage.''
	   The United States and its allies support autonomy for Kosovo but
oppose demands for independence. They face the dilemma of showing
force to the Serbs without showing favor to the rebel forces.
	   More than 250 people have died in clashes between government
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of the
Albanian independence movement. Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent
of the province's population.
	   The political objective of the military action, NATO said in its
declaration, is to ``support a political solution which brings an
end to the violence, provides an enhanced status for Kosovo,
preserves the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, and safeguards the human and civil rights of all the
inhabitants of Kosovo, whatever their ethnic origin.''

British privatizations will include air traffic control
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In a dramatic reversal of attitude, the Labor
government announced broad new privatization measures Thursday,
including the sell-off of Britain's air traffic control system.
	   Britain's Treasury chief, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon
Brown, left many of his Labor Party colleagues sitting in shocked
silence in the House of Commons when he unveiled plans to sell off
public properties and rein in spending.
	   Brown said he will sell the Commonwealth Development Corp., an
investment agency, and try to find private partners for the Royal
Mint, which makes British coins, and the Tote, which calculates
payoffs for racetrack wagers.
	   Labor's politicians had been sharply critical when previous
Conservative governments privatized the national airline, the
railroads, the gas company and other former state monopolies.
	   But a little more than a year after taking office, Labor is
practicing what it used to preach so loudly against.
	   Brown is selling off much of what remains, even including
highway service stations owned by the government. Brown urged local
governments to raise billions by selling off property, too.
	   Brown told lawmakers that the deals will enable the government
to spend billions on capital investment, as he also moved to bring
public spending under tighter control and to reform long-term
British budgetary planning.
	   Predictably, Brown was mocked by lawmaker Francis Maude, who
speaks for the opposition Conservatives on Treasury matters.
	   ``Today, it is goodbye `Iron Chancellor,''' Maude said, refering
to the nickname Brown earned last year when he moved boldly to
bring British finances under his control. ``May he rust in peace.''

President of Belarus to visit Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus
will visit Egypt on Monday and Tuesday, his office said.
	   Lukashenko is scheduled to meet with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and other senior officials.
	   ``Belarus sees cooperation with Egypt as especially important
because Egypt is a country which is energetically restructuring and
developing its economy,'' deputy prime minister Leonid Kozik said
Thursday.
	   Belarus has made fewer economic reforms than probably any other
former Soviet republic.
	   ``Taking into account that Egypt is one of the most influential
countries in North Africa and the Arab world, there is every reason
to believe that close economic relations with Egypt can help
Belarus develop relations with other countries in the region,''
Kozik said.

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan announced a moratorium on
nuclear testing Thursday, and asked for fresh peace talks with its
rival India.
	   Relations between Pakistan and India have been tense since the
two countries conducted tit-for-tat nuclear tests last month.
	   ``The government of Pakistan has decided to announce a
unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing,'' said a statement issued
by Pakistan's foreign ministry Thursday.
	   In an interview Thursday with The Associated Press, Foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub said ``we wanted to clarify our position . . .
so there would be no confusion that we will unilaterally agree to a
moratorium on testing.''
	   Pakistan is suggesting a ``no-nuclear test'' pact with India as
the first ``confidence-building measure at the regional level.''
	   India already has agreed to a moratorium on further nuclear
tests.
	   The U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan welcomed Pakistan's
unilateral moratorium, saying he would like to see both Pakistan
and India sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
	   ``This announcement is an important step in joining the
international norm of nuclear testing and nonproliferation,'' said
Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard.
	   Pakistan also said Thursday it was ready for new talks with
India about the disputed state of Kashmir, which has been the flash
point of two previous wars between Pakistan and India. The two
countries fought a third war in 1971 over Bangladesh or what was
then East Pakistan.
	   A united Kashmir was split between India and Pakistan after the
Asian subcontinent gained its independence from Britain in 1947.
	   ``Here there is an open conflict going on daily,'' Ayub said.
	   Ayub warned the international community that without a
settlement on Kashmir, there is a strong possibility of a fourth,
most probably nuclear, confrontation between India and Pakistan.
	   Last month's tests prompted immediate condemnation from numerous
nations. And on Saturday, the U.N. Security Council unanimously
passed a resolution urging India and Pakistan to halt their nuclear
weapons programs.
	   Led by the United States, several countries have imposed
economic sanctions against the two South Asian rivals that are
designed to discourage foreign investment and credit.
	   Annan is to send a special envoy to Pakistan and India to cool
tempers and lay the groundwork for his own visit to the region,
said the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan.

Butler urges cooperation, Baghdad paper calls for end to contact
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Butler's news conference &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons monitor Richard Butler
called Thursday for full Iraqi cooperation with his disarmament
inspectors while Baghdad's most influential newspaper demanded that
its government stops ``courting this mad dog.''
	   Butler arrived in Iraq Thursday accompanied by 18 senior U.N.
arms experts who are carrying satellite images, charts and material
evidence to back the U.N. position that Iraq is still hiding
information on illegal weapons.
	   ``What remains is relatively small and with Iraq's full
cooperation we can get this done in a very short time,'' he told
journalists at a news conference hours after his arrival.
	   Iraq has insisted that it has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction and has said that Butler's demands are politically
motivated.
	   The ``time has come to chop the tongue of this dog,'' said
Babil, a newspaper owned by President Saddam Hussein's son, Odai.
	   Iraq has to stop ``courting this mad dog,'' the paper added,
using an epithet the Iraqi press often applies to Butler.
	   Butler's commission is charged by the U.N. Security Council with
certifying that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass
destruction, a process necessary for the lifting of sweeping
sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
	   The dispute between Iraq and the commission has the potential to
provoke a crisis similar to that earlier this year when Iraq
refused to open its presidential sites to U.N. inspections. The
United States and Britain threatened to attack Iraq and war was
averted only when Iraq agreed to open the palaces as part of a deal
brokered by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Butler said he brought a list indicating what Iraq needs to do
to obtain a clean bill of health from the commission.
	   ``This list is it,'' he said. ``We have no second list in the
backroom.''
	   He added that his inspectors were ``near the end'' of verifying
Iraq's claim that it had destroyed all the warheads it filled with
chemical and biological agents.
	   Butler is scheduled to hold the first meeting of his five-day
visit with Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on Saturday.
	   Among the key points on Butler's list are:
	   _ Iraq must hand over information on long-range missiles that it
imported.
	   _ Iraq must prove it has scrapped all biological and chemical
warheads and missile fuel.
	   _ Iraq must provide documentation on domestic production of
long-range missiles.
	   _ Iraq must prove that it dismantled unaccounted for chemical
munitions including 155mm mustard gas shells and chemical and
biological bombs.
	   _ It must fully account for its past activities in producing the
chemical agent VX.

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The World Court said Thursday it
has authority to deal with the protracted territorial dispute
between West African neighbors Nigeria and Cameroon.
	   By a vote of 14 to three, the United Nations' highest judicial
arm said it has the jurisdiction to hear the conflict over land and
maritime boundary between the two nations.
	   At stake is the oil-rich Bakassi peninsula that once took the
two nations to the brink of war and triggered armed clashes in
recent years.
	   During earlier hearings, Nigeria introduced eight preliminary
objections and challenged the court's jurisdiction, saying the two
sides should settle all boundary disputes themselves.
	   But the court in its decision, which took almost three hours to
read, rejected seven of those objections and saved the eighth and
final objection for the next stage of the case.
	   By a vote of 14-3, the court also decided the case submitted by
Cameroon is admissible.
	   Cameroon's co-agent Professor Peter Ntamark was overjoyed.
	   ``This is what we have expected from this court. This is a very
honest and just court,'' he said.
	   Showing no outward signs of emotions, Nigeria's Attorney-General
Abdullahi Ibrahim said: ``Nigeria is a very loyal member of the
international community. The judgment has just been delivered and I
will find time to study it before any decision can be taken.''
	   With the jurisdiction question out of the way, the court can
proceed to the actual merits of the case. No date was immediately
set for the next round of oral hearings.
	   A definitive ruling will take several more years.
	   Both nations claim the Bakassi peninsula, which juts into the
Gulf of Guinea where their borders meet.
	   The two nations almost went to war over Bakassi in 1981, and
ever since, there have been sporadic hostilities. A series of
clashes in 1996 led the court to call on both parties to refrain
from further military action.
	   The court, formally known as the International Court of Justice,
has no enforcement powers and relies on nations to voluntarily
comply with its rulings.

	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	    &UR; ___
	   Verdens Gang, Oslo, Stockholm, on Serb attacks on ethnic
Albanians:
	   There is a well-oiled Serb war machine on the roll that is
leaving death and destruction among Kosovo Albanians. ... Once
again, there is a comprehensive ethnic cleansing under way in the
heart of Europe, and once again the outside world seems almost a
helpless bystander.
	   While Slobodan Milosevic's troops lay one village after another
in ruins, as many as 50,000 Kosovo Albanians are on the run. ...
This is a new Bosnia, despite all the vows that there would never
be another Bosnia in the Balkans.
	   ... Serious-looking foreign ministers and heads of states
express their grave concern about what is happening in Kosovo. But
words alone are little help against Slobodan Milosevic. He has long
since proved that with his rape of Bosnia. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Times, London, on EU ban on investment in Yugoslavia:
	   The European Union Monday announced a ban on investment in
Yugoslavia in response to the bloody crackdown by Serb forces on
the Albanian majority in Kosovo. America has indicated that it will
follow suit. But these pinpricks will do nothing to stop the
killings, ethnic cleansing and systematic destruction of Albanian
villages ordered by President Milosevic. It has all the familiar
hallmarks of the war in Bosnia. A Western military intervention
looks all but inevitable.
	   Milosevic, who posed as the guarantor of peace in Bosnia, has
been unmasked as a liar and a cheat, a man who feigned readiness to
talk with Kosovan Albanians while preparing a military strike.
	   The West has learnt from Bosnia. Past experience has shown that
only concerted action by Europe and America, working on an agreed
agenda with common assessments, will give the authority to NATO to
deal with the regional threat posed by an explosion in Kosovo. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   Neue Zuercher Zeitung, Zurich, Switzerland, on Nigeria:
	   In the four-and-a-half years that General Abacha headed the
provisional council holding the reins of power, Nigerian unity has
been preserved.
	   This must count as a success in a land in which, since
independence was gained in 1960, 10 coups have taken place. ...
	   In the multiracial potpourri of Nigeria, anarchy may not be a
reality, but it's still a permanent threat.
	   The attempts to contain secessionist and anarchic tendencies had
a price and to a certain extent a nasty side.
	   Abacha didn't want to leave anything to chance and controlled
the transition process to the last detail. ...
	   After Abacha's death, the fate of the transition process, the
promised transfer of power to an elected president is in limbo. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Straits Times, Singapore, on India and Pakistan:
	   For their own good, India and Pakistan should stop right away
any further development of their nuclear bombs and instead make the
search for peace, not weapons of mass destruction, their first
priority. There are no two ways about the nuclear arms race. Stop
it now, or be the poorer for it. ... It is time they heeded sound
advice, if there is to be peace in South Asia. ... The truth is
that neither side has gained from the escalation of terror. With
three wars and a tortured relationship, the nuclear arms race
between them can only lead to worse things, unless the suicidal
march to Armageddon is halted.
	    &UR; ___
	   La Stampa, Turin, Italy, on Eritrean-Ethiopian conflict:
	   What do Eritreans and Ethiopians really have in mind?
	   Will they continue to kill each other and to dissipate their
resources in the battles, desperately exiguous, or will they
finally find the way the reason, in this case a peace negotiation?
	   What is really striking in this conflict is the ...
aggressiveness shown by Eritrea, a small country with less than 4
million inhabitants, against one that has 50 million more. ...
	   But even more surprising is the fact that two pretty homogeneous
regimes (despite the antique tribal rivalries), born from the
common struggle against a communist dictatorship, show, to solve
their problems, such a clear attitude for the use of strength. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo, on Philippine's President-elect Joseph
Estrada:
	   The self-styled `friend of the poor' was supported by activists
from nongovernmental organizations as well as old leftists formerly
associated with the Philippines Communist Party. But his campaign
was reportedly bankrolled by capitalist cronies of the late
President Ferdinand Marcos. Rumors that Estrada will grant favors
to the plutocrats who helped him win the presidency have already
begun to fly.
	   His popular appeal notwithstanding, Estrada will not be able to
resolve the problem of poverty in the Philippines unless he
implements land reforms and redistributes land held by the largest
landowners. Estrada has committed himself to village development
projects to boost agricultural output but has not yet taken a clear
stand on land reform.
	   Whether Estrada will be able to carry out policies that benefit
the poor remains an open question. His first test will come after
the exhilaration of victory wears off and the public begins to take
a hard look at his policies.

	   The Sydney (Australia) Morning Herald, on soccer's World Cup:
	   When the reigning champions, Brazil, kick off the 1998 Football
World Cup tournament against Scotland at the Stade de France ...
the television audience is expected to be twice the size of that
for the Olympics. ...
	   A superficial audit would see football at its apogee as a world
sport and a worldwide industry. Sponsorship deals for the World Cup
tournament run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. On every
continent football is the main game, and a beautiful and passionate
spectacle. The globalization of markets has coincided with the
globalization of football. Fortunes are being made and lost by
clubs with their manipulation of the transfer fees of star players.
	   But beneath the glittering surface of world football there is
massive corruption. The all-powerful officials seem to have
contempt for the ordinary followers of the game. The resulting
alienation is represented by crowd thuggery that has no equivalent
in any other major sport. Supporters put their lives at risk when
they attend some matches. Games are being rigged. Gambling on
football is a money-laundering operation. The game, like rugby
league in Australia, is in danger of being lost in the excesses of
its corporatization. The new FIFA president, Sepp Blatter,
therefore, has one crucial task. He must return the sport to
football.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Jordan Times, Amman, Jordan, on Mideast peace talks:
	   The doom and gloom which have dominated the Palestinian-Israeli
peace talks until now have suddenly changed into a sense of
measured optimism, if we are to believe recent reports that Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has truly changed his attitude
and is now serious about accepting Washington's peace formula. The
concerned parties have experienced similar euphoria in the past,
only to have their hopes dashed at the last minute.
	   At this point, we are not prepared to believe anything until we
see real changes on the ground. A bona fide acceptance of the
Clinton administration's peace plan is one thing, a conditional
endorsement of it is something altogether different.
	   Still there are grounds for some optimism. President Clinton
never wavered on his peace initiative, which has drawn out after
painstaking assessments. Besides, the U.S. ideas are closer to the
Israeli stance than to the Palestinian position.
	   Even if this idea goes through, Israel would come out ahead
since the salient features of the new pact correspond more to
Israeli thinking than the PNA's. Nevertheless, there could be a new
momentum for peace generated by the implementation of the U.S.
principles which we hope could trigger additional steps on the long
and tortuous road to a comprehensive and just peace in the Middle
East.
	    &UR; ___
	   Der Standard, Vienna, Austria, on Slovakia's nuclear reactor:
	   When the announcement came that the Slovakian nuclear power
plant in Mochovce was active, Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima
acted surprised. ... What did he expect?
	   For Slovak Prime Minister Meciar to personally ask for
permission from Mr. Klima, if he flips the switch now? ... Our head
of government really believes that Austria has the power to forbid
the startup of power stations in neighbor states. ...
	   And it corresponds with an expected attitude of many Austrians,
who were ``informed'' by television, radio and tabloids in the past
weeks that Mochovce would be especially dangerous.
	   The truth is that the concerns of the nuclear power opponents
are not taken as seriously anywhere else as in Austria.
	   Mochovce radiates. That may not make the anxious Austrians
happy, but it is a reality we have to live with.
	    &UR; ___
	   Le Figaro, Paris, on France and World Cup:
	   France is giving an odd show. Due to the soccer event, the
entire world has its eyes fixed on the country. It sees it caught
in both a party and a strike. What's more, the (Air France) strike
is linked to the party. At the dawn of the third millennium, the
World Cup was meant to represent a culminating event. But it might
well become the first real difficulty for a government whose path
has until now been one of roses, thanks to a collapsed opposition.
	   Yesterday's party of the giants marks the introduction to the
World Cup, a World Cup which from now on and for several weeks will
occupy most of the world's headlines. It seems that, from the
Concorde's Obelisk to the Saint-Denis stadium, everything is
hanging off the round ball. Whether in the press or in the minds,
there is room for nothing else. The FIFA _ soccer's governing body
_ is everywhere, traffic is blocked, and ministers and their
opponents alike are proclaiming their love of soccer, a sport
embodied by the four cartoon-like giants who took over Paris.
	    &UR; ___
	   Albuquerque Journal, Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Terry Nichols'
sentencing in Oklahoma bombing:
	   Virginia Moser, who helped retrieve dead babies from the rubble
of the bombed Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City,
hears them crying in her nightmares. For many Americans, the
nightmare of the Oklahoma City bombing is of such enormity it will
not soon fade.
	   The sentencing of Terry Nichols, convicted of plotting the
bombing that ended 168 lives April 19, 1995, does offer a kind of
closure. Nichols, convicted of conspiracy and eight involuntary
manslaughter counts, was sentenced to life behind bars without
possibility of parole. His attorneys are appealing. His
co-conspirator, Timothy McVeigh, has already been sentenced to
death.
	   But in sequestering Nichols from society, U.S. District Judge
Richard Matsch delivered more than a sentence. He delivered a
message that no doubt means more to the rest of the nation than to
a defendant who displayed no emotion, but just sat and stared.
	   Matsch called Nichols an ``enemy of the Constitution.'' With
that statement, Matsch gave voice to the belief that Nichols and
McVeigh were not merely murderers _ as grossly horrific as their
crime was _ but traitors in every sense of the word. ...

World Cup: Baggio penalty earns 2-2 tie for Italy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Pres Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Roberto Baggio, whose last World Cup
penalty cleared the crossbar and handed the trophy to Brazil four
years ago, fired in a spot kick six minutes from the end to salvage
a 2-2 tie against Chile Thursday.
	   The veteran striker, recalled to the Italian lineup at age 31
after playing only one game in three years, coolly slotted the ball
past goalkeeper Nelson Tapia from the penalty spot after Ronald
Fuentes' right arm couldn't get out of the way of a Baggio cross.
	   Chile was leading 2-1 thanks to two stunning strikes by Marcelo
Salas, after Christian Vieri had given Italy a 10th minute lead off
a Baggio sideways pass.
	   Italy, playing in all-white, took the lead with a stunning
counter-attack after Ivan Zamorano, who ironically plays for Inter
Milan, lost possession deep in the Italian half.
	   Vieri and Baggio were well advanced with only two Chilean
defenders between them and the goal and the 1994 World Cup star
collected a long through ball from Paolo Maldini.
	   Instead of heading for goal, Baggio unselfishly slipped the ball
sideways to the better positioned Vieri who slid it home from 15
yards (meters) with his left foot.
	   The Italians continued to feed Vieri and Baggio from deep
positions but Chile, aiming to make the second round for only the
second time in seven attempts, came back into the game strongly and
levelled in the third minute of first half injury time.
	   Fabian Estay swung in a left-wing corner kick, Zamorano powered
in a header, Pedro Reyes touched the ball on and Salas turned to
fire the ball home with his left foot.
	   Four minutes into the second half, Salas struck again, climbing
to a right wing cross, beating Fabio Cannavaro in the air and
powering a header between goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca and the
post.
	   Italian coach Cesare Maldini sent on Luigi Di Biagio and Enrico
Chiesa for Roberto Di Matteo and Angelo Di Livio to change the
pattern. But the Italians still looked vulnerable on the
counter-attack and frequently were caught out by high crosses.
	   Maldini sent on Juventus striker Filippo Inzaghi for Vieri with
just under 20 minutes remaining and he almost tied the game in the
80th.
	   Baggio slipped another clever ball through the Chilean defense
but goalkeeper Tapia was fast off his line and blocked the
striker's first time, close range shot with his legs.
	   Lineups:
	   Italy _ Gianluca Pagliuca; Alessandro Nesta, Paolo Maldini,
Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Costacurta, Dino Baggio, Angelo Di
Livio (Enrico Chiesa, 61st), Demetrio Albertini, Roberto Di Matteo
(Luigi Di Biagio, 58th), Christian Vieri (Filippo Inzaghi, 71st),
Roberto Baggio.
	   Chile _ Nelson Tapia; Ronald Fuentes, Pedro Reyes, Javier Margas
(Miguel Ramirez, 64th), Moises Villarroel, Francisco Rojas, Nelson
Parraguez, Clarence Acuna (Fernando Cornejo, 82nd), Fabian Estay
(Jose Sierra, 81st), Ivan Zamorano, Marcelo Salas.

spasms, which make a defense of his U.S. Open title next week ``a
day-to-day thing,'' he said.
	   Els pulled out of the tournament at Westchester Country Club
after nine holes of the first round.
	   The 28-year-old South African said he first experienced
discomfort in his back three weeks ago, had spasms Wednesday night
and went to the fitness center this morning before his round.
	   ``I was still hurting on the first hole,'' Els said. ``I tried
to make it through but I just couldn't do it.''
	   Els made a birdie on the first hole he played but then made four
bogeys before pulling out of the event on the northern outskirts of
New York City.
	   The U.S. Open, which Els won in 1994 and last year, begins
Thursday at The Olympic Club in San Francisco. The cross-country
flight involved prompted a lot of players to skip tournaments the
last two weeks because of the travel strain.
	   Tiger Woods pulled out of the Kemper Open last week with a sore
back.
	   Els said he would either see the doctor in Columbus, Georgia,
who is treating Davis Love III for his back problem or return to
his home in Orlando, Florida, and seek treatment there.
	   ``Obviously, next week is a day-to-day thing at this point,''
Els said about the U.S. Open.
	   One of Els' main competitors next week at the Open, Lee Westwood
of England, says he is taking to heart _ and to stomach, hips and
rear end _ some advice from Gary Player.
	   Player told the 25-year-old Englishman that Westwood has a
chance to be a great player _ if he controls his weight.
	   ``Yeah, cheers, thanks very much,'' Westwood said Wednesday,
recalling his mixed emotions at hearing the comment. ``I know I'm
fat.''
	   Westwood, who is 6 feet (1.83 meters) tall and weighs 205 pounds
(93 kilos), said he has made a concerted effort to get in better
shape in the five weeks since. He has forced himself to make time
to exercise regularly and submitted to a ``light'' diet, which he
said means going light on fatty foods, biscuits, Coca-Cola and _
here he winced _ beer.
	   With only Jim Furyk and Mark Calcavecchia entered here from
among the Top 10 on the U.S. PGA tour's money leaders, a contingent
of foreign players led by Els, Westwood, Jesper Parnevik, Frank
Nobilo, Darren Clarke, Vijay Singh and Nick Faldo figures to
dominate the Buick Classic.
	   In all, 17 of the top 30 players internationally are in the
field. Many of them are using the tournament as a working stopover
on the way from Europe to California for the Open.
	   ``Basically, it is halfway between England and San Francisco,''
Westwood said.
	   Westwood won his first PGA event this year, in New Orleans in
April, and has won nine tournaments in all around the world. He
said his goal is to be ranked No. 1 in the world _ Els now holds
that distinction _ and may begin playing more in the United States
because good finishes on the PGA tour carry more weight in the
international rankings than similar finishes in Asia or Europe.
	   Westwood is currently ranked No. 13 in the world. He was
dismayed by not moving up after winning the English Open last
weekend in Ware, England, he said.

IMF said to demand Russian budget cuts, tax reform
</HEADLINE>

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund wants Russia to
adopt a strict austerity plan in exchange for billions of dollars
in new loans, a top Western banking official said Thursday.
	   It's not clear precisely what the IMF is offering, however, or
whether Russia is willing or able to agree to the deal.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was
familiar with a letter from the IMF to the Russian government
outlining its demands: that Russia slash its budget deficit, pass a
tax reform package, break up the Gazprom energy monopoly and be
more open about its statistics and fiscal activities.
	   The Russian government already claims to be pursuing several of
those goals, although it faces resistance in the
Communist-dominated lower house of parliament.
	   Since Russia's financial markets collapsed late last month,
there has been growing speculation that the country is seeking an
additional dlrs 5 billion to dlrs 10 billion in loans from the IMF
or the Group of Eight leading industrial countries.
	   The Russian stock market perked up last week on rumors of an
emergency bailout plan. It has since slumped again, and continued
to sink Thursday, in part on doubts that an IMF bailout is
imminent.
	   The government took one new step Thursday to raise revenue,
authorizing natural gas discounts of up to 30 percent to customers
who pay in cash.
	   The discount is aimed at improving the cash balance of Gazprom,
the nation's largest tax delinquent. Gazprom has said it cannot pay
taxes because its customers cannot pay their bills in cash.
	   The New York Times reported Thursday that the demands presented
by the IMF included cutting the budget deficit nearly in half, from
the current goal of 4.5 percent of gross domestic product to 2.5
percent of GDP. The Western banking official here said he could
confirm the substance of the Times report.
	   He said it wasn't clear how much money the IMF might be willing
to loan Russia. ``No amounts are being talked about,'' he said.
	   The new government of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko has been
moving to cut spending in an effort to further reduce the deficit.
	   The government is also pushing a tax reform package that is
stuck in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament.
	   According to The Times, the IMF wants that measure passed before
the Duma recesses next month.
	   Charles Blitzer, a former head of the World Bank office in
Moscow who now follows Eastern European markets for a U.S.
investment bank in London, said he agreed with the IMF strategy,
but thought it might be pushing too hard.
	   ``It's high time that the Russians start to attack some of their
problems and to do it in a meaningful way,'' he said. But Blitzer
said there was a danger in the IMF making too many demands, or
demands that the Russians were likely to fail to carry out.
	   ``Because if they fail one more time, it may not be a financial
crisis but a financial meltdown,'' he said.

NATO plans to flaunt its power to Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with fresh details. CHANGES byline,

 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO decided Thursday to use military
preparations, including simulated air strikes, to send a strong
message to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that he should
cease his crackdown on separatist Kosovo.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and his 15 NATO colleagues
approved a package of measures they hoped would convinced Milosevic
to pull back his Serb-led army and police forces in the province
where they have been carrying out escalating attacks on the
ethnic-Albanian majority.
	   ``President Milosevic would be rash and foolish if he would
ignore the message coming from NATO,'' said British Defense
Secretary George Robertson. ``The message is clear and unambiguous
_ Belgrade, think again.''
	   More than 250 people have died in clashes between government
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of the
Albanian independence movement. Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent
of the province's population.
	   Under the measures, NATO will conduct simulated air attacks in
Albania and Macedonia, probably sometime next week, and study
options for further action ranging from accelerated planning for
military exercises in the region to direct air strikes inside
Yugoslavia and the use of air mobile ground troops.
	   This is aimed at persuading Milosevic to declare a cease-fire in
the province, withdraw his forces and open serious negotiations
with the opposition.
	   ``We will be holding exercises in the region, including
immediately an air exercise which will demonstrate NATO's
capability to rapidly project power into the region,'' NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said: ``We cannot afford
any longer to focus on hollow solutions of rather symbolic
character like border security missions in Albania or Macedonia.''
	   No one, however, was able to give any assurances that a mere
demonstration of NATO power would be sufficient to stop a Balkan
leader apparently bent on ruthlessly putting down a rebellion in
his own country.
	   ``I don't think anyone can predict what will impress or persuade
Mr. Milosevic,'' said Cohen, adding that a demonstration firepower
would have ``some educational value.''
	   ``We believe very strongly that it will send a signal that there
is not only solidarity of opinion but also the ability to rapidly
deploy forces that could engage in a significant activity in a
short period of time,'' he said.
	   A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the exercises will be carried out in the next few
days and could include simulated bombing raids by NATO planes and
rocket attacks by helicopters. Details were still being worked out.
	   The United States and its allies support autonomy for Kosovo but
oppose demands for independence. They face the dilemma of showing
force to the Serbs without showing favor to the rebel forces.
	   The political objective of the military action, NATO said in its
declaration, is to ``support a political solution which brings an
end to the violence, provides an enhanced status for Kosovo,
preserves the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, and safeguards the human and civil rights of all the
inhabitants of Kosovo, whatever their ethnic origin.''

Government to reduce public expenditure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae Thursday
proposed tightening tax collection and reducing government spending
in his 9.8 billion Kenya pounds (dlrs 3.2 billion) 1998-99 budget
presented to parliament.
	   ``The budget ... reflects two principals that can be summarized
in a few words _ fiscal restraint and a balanced budget,'' Nyachae
said.
	   He insisted that raising taxes to increase revenue would be
counterproductive since Kenyans are already living in hard times
because of the country's poor economic performance.
	   Nyachae proposed that the number of school teachers be reduced
from 260,000 by about 66,000 over the next three years and that the
bloated civil service _ the size of which is not known _ be reduced
by 59,000 over the same period.
	   He said economic growth fell to 2.3 percent in 1997, down from
4.6 percent in 1996. The target had been 5.3 percent.
	   For the first time, the budgets of the three members of the East
Africa Cooperation _ Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania _ were read to
respective parliaments on the same day.
	   In neighboring Uganda, Finance Minister Gerard Ssendawula
presented his dlrs 1.3 billion budget to parliament and said the
government would increase defense spending from 132 billion
shillings (dlrs 132 million) to 163 billion shillings (dlrs 163
million) to deal with rebellions in the north and west.
	   He said security _ as well as education, roads and the
erradication of poverty _ were the priorities of President Yoweri
Museveni's government.
	   But donor nations are critical of the regular rise in Uganda's
defense spending.
	   Five legislators were expelled from the session, and another two
walked out as they attempted to disrupt the budget reading for the
second year in a row.
	   President Daniel Arap Moi, 74, sat quietly or dozed throughout
the two-hour presentation.
	   Nyachae, who is a member of parliament from Moi's ruling Kenya
African National Union party, blamed the government for the
persistent corruption he said was responsible for the poor economic
performance.
	   Opposition legislator Richard Leakey said the budget was
designed to cheat Kenyans.
	   ``It is strong on good ideas but weak on proposed approaches,''
he said. ``If the government is serious in dealing with the current
economic crisis, it will have to reduce its spending, but it does
not have the strength to do that.''
	   Chief opposition leader Mwai Kibaki, a former Moi finance
minister, called the budget ``very good,'' but said ``we must wait
for implementation.''
	   Nyachae proposed that each ministry have its own independent
financial controller.

World Cup: Baggio penalty earns 2-2 tie for Italy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDs Cesare Maldini quote, detail of Baggio in '94
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Roberto Baggio, whose last World Cup
penalty cleared the crossbar and handed the trophy to Brazil four
years ago, fired home a spot kick six minutes from the end to
salvage a 2-2 tie against Chile Thursday.
	   The veteran striker, recalled to the Italian lineup at age 31
after playing only one game in three years, coolly slotted the ball
past goalkeeper Nelson Tapia from the penalty spot after Ronald
Fuentes' right arm couldn't get out of the way of a Baggio cross.
	   Chile was leading 2-1 thanks to two stunning strikes by Marcelo
Salas, after Christian Vieri had given Italy a 10th minute lead off
a Baggio sideways pass.
	   Baggio's late spot kick brought back memories of World Cup '94.
The former Juventus and AC Milan star, now moving from Bologna to
Inter Milan, carried Italy game after game in the United States
with his goals, some of them late in the game or in overtime.
	   But he couldn't hit the target in the penalty shootout that
followed a scoreless final against Brazil in Pasadena. Baggio fired
over the top and Brazil won the title for a record fourth time.
	   ``What happened four years ago doesn't count right now,'' said
Italy's coach, Cesare Maldini. ``I was pleased with the team's
reaction and its thirst for a goal.''
	   Italy, playing in all-white, took the lead with a stunning
counter-attack after Ivan Zamorano, who ironically plays for Inter
Milan, lost possession deep in the Italian half.
	   Vieri and Baggio were well advanced with only two Chilean
defenders between them and the goal and the 1994 World Cup star
collected a long through ball from Paolo Maldini.
	   Instead of heading for goal, Baggio unselfishly slipped the ball
sideways to the better positioned Vieri who slid it home from 15
yards (meters) with his left foot.
	   Chile, aiming to make the second round for only the second time
in seven attempts, came back into the game strongly and levelled in
the third minute of first half injury time.
	   Fabian Estay swung in a left-wing corner kick, Zamorano powered
in a header, Pedro Reyes touched the ball on and Salas turned to
fire the ball home with his left foot.
	   Four minutes into the second half, Salas struck again, climbing
to a right wing cross, beating Fabio Cannavaro in the air and
powering a header between goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca and the
post.
	   Coach Maldini sent on Luigi Di Biagio and Enrico Chiesa for
Roberto Di Matteo and Angelo Di Livio to change the pattern. But
the Italians still looked vulnerable on the counter-attack and
frequently were caught out by high crosses.
	   Maldini sent on Juventus striker Filippo Inzaghi for Vieri with
just under 20 minutes remaining and he almost tied the game in the
80th.
	   Baggio slipped another clever ball through the Chilean defense
but goalkeeper Tapia was fast off his line and blocked the
striker's first time, close range shot with his legs.
	   Lineups:
	   Italy _ Gianluca Pagliuca; Alessandro Nesta, Paolo Maldini,
Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Costacurta, Dino Baggio, Angelo Di
Livio (Enrico Chiesa, 61st), Demetrio Albertini, Roberto Di Matteo
(Luigi Di Biagio, 58th), Christian Vieri (Filippo Inzaghi, 71st),
Roberto Baggio.
	   Chile _ Nelson Tapia; Ronald Fuentes, Pedro Reyes, Javier Margas
(Miguel Ramirez, 64th), Moises Villarroel, Francisco Rojas, Nelson
Parraguez, Clarence Acuna (Fernando Cornejo, 82nd), Fabian Estay
(Jose Sierra, 81st), Ivan Zamorano, Marcelo Salas.
	   Referee: Lucian Bouchardeau, Nigeria.

Georgia, Abkhazia blame each other for lack of settlement progress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Georgia and separatist Abkhazia accused one
another Thursday of using refugees as a bargaining chip to further
their political ambitions, and acknowledged that nine days of talks
have brought little progress.
	   Georgian and Abkhazian envoys have been meeting in Moscow to
arrange direct talks between their presidents and draft a series of
potential agreements. But negotiations quickly hit a snag, with the
two sides failing to find any common ground.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwest Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. The separatists drove out Georgian troops and
ethnic Georgian civilians in a 13-month war.
	   Violence has broken about sporadically since then, despite the
presence of Russian peacekeepers in the region. Dozens of people
were killed in fighting last month between Abkhazian separatists
and militia groups that support Georgia's central government.
	   On Thursday, unidentified attackers fired automatic rifles and
grenade throwers at a helicopter carrying the chief of Russian
peacekeepers in the region and other senior officials, the
ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies reported. No one was injured.
	   Georgia wants Abkhazia to allow an immediate, unconditional
return of 38,000 ethnic Georgian refugees who fled fighting in
Abkhazia last month.
	   Georgia claims that Abkhazia will allow the refugees to return
only is certain economic and political demands are met, which would
amount to a greater recognition of Abkhazia's independence.
	   ``Abkhazia wants to solve all the problems it has raised since
1992, while allowing only a limited return of refugees,'' Georgian
envoy Vazha Lordkipanidze told reporters.
	   No true, said Abkhazian envoy Anri Dzhergenia.
	   He insisted that Abkhazia's only condition is that it be allowed
time to build housing for returning refugees, and that the
Abkhazian government would still try to bring everybody back within
a year.
	   Hundreds of homes in a string of ethnic Georgian-inhabited
villages in Abkhazia were burned during the fighting in May.
	   ``We have no other conditions _ just that they return not to a
bare spot, to empty land,'' Dzhergenia said.
	   But ``the Georgian side has been saying: either all at once, or
not at all.''
	   Dzhergenia conceded that Abkhazia wants to screen returning
refugees to make sure they don't include either pro-Georgian
militants who took part in the latest clashes, or members of
Abkhazia's pro-Georgian government-in-exile.
	   The government-in-exile is a broad structure that includes a
Cabinet, parliament, prosecutor general and dozens of local
administration chiefs _ all of whom oppose Abkhazia's independence.
	   ``Ordinary people are suffering because of the ambitions of
those people who ... want to return like a government,'' Dzhergenia
said. ``That's why all that drag with the refugees is being drawn
out.''

Baggio thwarts Chile's upset bid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout with Italy-Chile, training camp news; CHANGES
byline &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Just as Chile appeared destined to pull the first
major upset of France '98, Roberto Baggio was given a chance at
redemption.
	   Baggio, who missed the penalty kick that ended the World Cup
four years ago, this time found the mark in the 84th minute to lift
Italy to a 2-2 draw with the South Americans on Thursday.
	   Baggio, who made all 11 penalty kicks he took in Italian league
play this year and would not have been in starting lineup were it
not for an injury to Alessandro Del Piero, took the penalty after
defender Ronald Fuentes was whistled for a hand ball in the box.
	   Still, the draw marked another slow start for Italy, which fell
1-0 to Ireland in its opener four years ago before rallying to
become the eventual runner-up to Brazil. Baggio took the final shot
in the penalty shootout against Brazil and missed high.
	   In a game played in intermittent downpours and sunshine in
Bordeaux, Marcelo Salas scored in first-half injury time and in the
49th minute for the Chileans, who have been made it past the first
round only once six previous World Cup appearances _ and that was
when they hosted the tournament in 1962.
	   Salas, who will join Italy's Lazio next season in a dlrs 20
million transfer, scored 11 goals in qualifying play _ two less
than the entire Italian team.
	   Christian Vieri gave Italy the early lead with a goal in the
10th minute.
	   Later Thursday, Cameroon and Austria played in another Group B
match in Toulouse. Three games are set for Friday: South
Arabia-Denmark in Lens, France-South Africa in Marseille and
Paraguay-Bulgaria in Montpellier.
	   Japan, in the World Cup for the first time, doesn't open play
until Sunday against Argentina, but that's too soon for many
Japanese fans who bought tickets that have failed to materialize.
	   While five Japanese travel agencies reportedly were deciding to
cancel World Cup tours because some 12,000 tickets haven't turned
up, a group of 76 fans already at the team's training camp at
Aix-en-Provence waited to find out if even that much-smaller number
could be met.
	   ``I'm trying to be optimistic,'' said Masami Tachi, a
34-year-old housewife from Tokyo. ``But if we don't get tickets
soon, we're going to take the tour coordinator hostage. We will not
kill him.''
	   At other training camps, injuries were the main concern.
	   Germany lost defensive midfielder Steffen Freund for at least 10
days with a pulled a muscle in his right calf. He'll likely miss
two games.
	   Forward Nwankwo Kanu practiced with Nigeria for the first time
since the Olympic champions arrived in France, although another
striker, Daniel Amokachi, sat out with a twisted right knee.
	   Meanwhile, the Netherlands became the last of the 32 teams to
arrive in France, taking up residence in Versailles ahead of
Saturday's match against rival Belgium.
	   Injured Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp went through a full _
though not very strenuous _ training session and emerged smiling
and unharmed.
	   ``It is going very well at the moment,'' said Bergkamp, who hurt
his hamstring six weeks ago. ``I do not feel any pain any more.''
	   Spying also became an issue Thursday, with Spanish coach Javier
Clemente venting anger after some photographers attempted to enter
a closed practice session.
	   And Croatia was upset when its own spies were sent away from an
open practice held by Jamaica, its first World Cup opponent.
Croatian soccer federation president Branko Miksa said tournament
rules say no one can be barred from an open practice, not even
officials from other teams.
	   ``We don't want to make a big noise about this, but we will send
a protest to FIFA and the organizing committee,'' he said.
	   And, in a court in Paris, a Scottish soccer fan was sentenced to
a two-month suspended sentence for throwing beer cans at a French
policeman after Tuesday night's pre-Cup parade.
	   Christopher Kyles, 23, of Aberdeen, apologized to the court,
admitted being drunk and said he remembered none of his actions.

Japan still hopes for extradition of Red Army members
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Japan is still hoping that five Japanese
Red Army members will be extradited after serving their prison
terms in Lebanon, Tokyo's ambassador said Thursday.
	   Speaking after talks with the director-general of the Lebanese
Foreign Ministry, Ambassador Matsuhiro Horiguchi told reporters
that the Red Army cadres would be deported when they finish their
three-year terms in 2000.
	   Asked how they could be sent to Japan in the absence of an
extradition treaty with Lebanon, Horiguchi said many things could
be arranged without such agreements.
	   Japan wants to put the five people on trial for extremist
violence. Formed in 1971, the Red Army was a shadowy ultra-leftist
group that carried out a number of attacks, including a raid on Tel
Aviv airport that left 24 people dead.
	   The five members were detained in Lebanon in February 1997 and
convicted in July of entering the country illegally. The court
ordered their expulsion at the end of their sentences.
	   Japan has already requested their early extradition, but Lebanon
has refused.
	   The five include Kozo Okamoto, 49, who took part in the 1972
attack on Tel Aviv airport. He served 12 years in an Israeli jail
and was freed in a 1985 prisoner exchange between Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
	   In its judgment of the five, the Lebanese court described the
Tel Aviv attack as ``heroic,'' reflecting public sympathy for the
Palestinian cause.
	   Okamoto and the other four _ Mariko Yamamoto, 56, the only
woman, Kazuo Tohira, 44, Masao Adachi, 57, and Haruwo Wako, 48 _
had lived for years in Lebanon, harbored by Palestinian guerrillas
and leftist groups.

German doctor convicted of murdering his two young children in

<TEXT>
	   PALMA DE MALLORCA, Spain (AP) _ A German doctor was convicted
Thursday of murdering his two young children while vacationing on
the Spanish resort island of Mallorca in September 1996.
	   Dr. Ruedeger Oyntzen admitted to injecting his 8-year-old
daughter and 6-year-old son with a lethal dose of tranquilizers
when he was arrested, just hours after the children's bodies were
found in their beds in a hotel.
	   The jury in the trial that began June 1 rejected the defense's
argument that the doctor suffered from a personality disorder that
diminished his responsibility for the deaths.
	   Oyntzen had taken his children for a two-week vacation to the
sunny Mediterranean island off the northeastern Spanish coast
shortly after losing a custody battle with his estranged wife in
the German courts.
	   After his arrest the 40-year-old radiologist from Breisach,
Germany, said the loss of custody had prompted him to kill his
children.
	   The prosecution seeks a 40-year jail term, while the defense is
hoping that Oyntzen's immediate confession will cut this by over
half, the national news agency EFE reported.
	   Defense lawyer Carlos Portalo said he and his client are waiting
for the presiding judge to hand down the sentence, at an as yet
unspecified date, before they decide whether to appeal.

Key defender Vidovic uncertain for Dutch clash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTHIEUX, France (AP) _ Belgian coach Georges Leekens left
veteran playmaker Enzo Scifo off the starting lineup for Saturday's
World Cup opener against the Netherlands and doubted whether
defender Gordan Vidovic would recover from injury in time.
	   Vidovic had been key in Belgium's successful preparation
campaign, but injured his hamstring early this week.
	   ``It doesn't look good,'' said Leekens, who might have to
rejuggle his entire defensive scheme.
	   Leekens built his midfield around Marc Wilmots of Germany's
Schalke 04 and left Scifo on the sidelines, sticking with his
pre-World Cup strategy. Wilmots has been the coming man on the
Belgian team and his forceful attacking style contrasts sharply
with Scifo's often hesitant play.
	   Scifo is seeking to play in his fourth World Cup, but a row with
the coach and a recent illness have held him back. Three weeks ago
an ear infection and high fever put his training schedule well
behind the rest of the team.
	   ``He's slowly coming back,'' said Leekens.
	   Leekens said a bitter three-month quarrel with Scifo going into
the finals did not affect his decision.
	   Instead, defensive midfielder Franky Van der Elst will see
action in his fourth successive World Cup. The FC Bruges player has
been a Belgian mainstay since 1986, when the Red Devils reached the
semifinals in Mexico.
	   Leekens has pushed his team firmly in the underdog role for the
match against the Netherlands and promised risky tactics to counter
the cocky, open play of the Dutch.
	   ``We'll be using 2-3-4 attackers, it's the only way against the
Dutch. We have to be willing to take risks,'' he said.
	   The strikeforce will be spearheaded by Fiorentina's Luis
Oliveira and PSV Eindhoven's Luc Nilis with Wilmots and Danny
Boffin also providing offensive thrust.
	   Belgium also was the underdog when the neighbors and age-old
rivals played at the 1994 World Cup, yet Belgium surprisingly
prevailed 1-0. During qualifyiing for the French finals, the Dutch
beat the Belgians twice, 3-0 and 3-1.
	   This time, Leekens is already looking past the Dutch game as if
he were already conceding defeat.
	   ``The second game, Mexico is the most important game, we do our
preparation for that game,'' he said.

Pakistan braces for tough reforms to counter economic fallout of

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan will survive the economic
fallout of its nuclear testing, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said
Thursday, as he promised to halve government expenses, redistribute
land from rich to poor people and help small businsses.
	   In a 60-minute televised address, Sharif promised an ``economic
revolution'' to counter economic sanctions triggered by the
international community's anger with Pakistan's nuclear tests.
	   The tests were conducted soon after India detonated five nuclear
devices. The two countries have fought three wars in 51 years.
	   Saying it was an ``honor'' to be counted among the world's
nuclear powers, Sharif said ``we (now) have to pay the price. Being
an atomic power is not something to take lightly . . . we have come
to this point after very difficult decisions.''
	   ``We have taken the first step . . . toward self-reliance and
prosperity,'' he said.
	   His first, and probably most difficult task, will be to
confiscate 1.25 million acres (half a million hectares) of land
from some of the country's largest and most powerful land owners.
	   When the British left the subcontinent in 1947, they gave huge
tracts of land to local leaders as payment for their loyalty. That
land will be taken away and given to the country's landless, said
Sharif.
	   ``All I ask of you is to work hard on the land and make it
prosperous,'' he said.
	   This move is expected to cause an uproar among the powerful
landowners in Pakistan, many of whom are members of Parliament.
	   Sharif, by contrast, comes from one of Pakistan's biggest
business families.
	   Among his reforms is a promised 50 percent cut in government
expenses. He said he will be moving out of the palatial prime
minister's residence and converting the 60-acre home into a state
guest house.
	   Earlier Sharif moved his staff out of a newly constructed
400-room prime minister's office building and put it up for sale.
	   Sharif also promised favorable loans to small businesses and
warned people with outstanding bank loans that they had four weeks
to pay their debts or ``we will make a horrible example of you.''
	   Pakistanis have some dlrs 2 billion in outstanding loans with
the country's banks.
	   Within hours of detonating its sixth nuclear device on May 30
Pakistan imposed a state of emergency in the country and froze
foreign currency accounts to prevent a panic exodus of foreign
capital.
	   Sharif said as a businessman he cringed at having to impose
economic restrictions, but a foreign exchange reserve of barely
dlrs 1.3 billion, left him with little choice.
	   Other economic measures he announced included: reducing the size
of Pakistani missions abroad, ending the purchase by government
officials of cars and furniture, no more government-paid travel or
medical treatment outside the country.
	   Pakistan would also halve its imports of staples such as edible
oil and tea.
	   Sharif said his budget, expected Friday, will include a general
sales tax .

	   RAYONG -- Doctors and nurses from a petrol refining company
provided medical checks on teachers and students at a nearby school
suffering from throat, skin and eye complaints as a result of toxic
gases being emitted by a gas company.
	   Two Mab Ta Put Pan Withaya School students were rushed to
hospital after exposure to perlite emissions from the Bangkok
Industrial Gases Co in Muang Rayong district. A school
administrator complained of the growing number of teachers at the
school seeking transfers on grounds of the hazards to their health.
	   Most of the student complaints involved rashes and sore eyes for
which they were given carlamine and bedrest in the school's first
aid room. Others were given a solution to wash their eyes. Still
others vomited and complained of shortness of breath and were
rushed to Ban Chang hospital. A number of teachers were suffering
from eye and throat pain, doctors said.
	   While treating the patients, doctors and nurses were able to
smell the gases intermittently.
	   Admitted to Bamrung-rat Hospital was eighth-grade student Apinya
Wongseesai, whose immune deficiency complaint was exacerbated after
exposure to the emissions. Seventh-grader Rewat Sookcharoen was
admitted to Ban Chang hospital after complaining of continuous
vomiting.
	   Mab Ta Put Pan Pithaya school director Winit Prathanrat said
Wednesday he received a new spate of applications for transfer, on
top of three already approved.
	   Meanwhile, Wachira Nimwatanakul, the provincial health and
environmental health officer, installed equipment at the school to
collect particles of less than 10 microns to determine if pollution
levels exceed acceptable levels. Bangkok Industrial Gases assistant
managing director Chalee Hancharoenpaitoon said Wednesday the
perlite was pulverised volcanic rock used in the industry as an
insulator to maintain freezing temperatures in gas containers. He
said it causes skin irritation but it is not flammable or
explosive.

Sampras beats Black as rain eases
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS; UPDATES with Sampras, Rafter quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Despite an easy two-set victory over Wayne Black
Thursday at Queen's Club, Pete Sampras' first warmup match for
Wimbledon was anything but easy.
	   The top-seeded American, playing his first match since losing in
the second round of the French Open, won 6-2, 6-3 on a windy, wet
day with chilly, autumn-like conditions making play treacherous.
	   Sampras wore cyling shorts beneath his regular shorts and
several times blew on his fingers to keep them warm. Black fell
twice on the slippery surface and twice appealed in vain for the
match to be halted.
	   Organizers, facing a huge backlog of matches after three days of
rain delays, pushed ahead with the program. But Sampras'
third-round match later against Mark Woodforde had to be put off.
	   ``It is slippery and you've got to be a little bit careful,''
Sampras said. ``It is dangerous. Your foot could get stuck or you
could slip, and it's very easy to twist an ankle out there.
	   ``But I just wanted to play. We've all just been sitting around
all week, and although it wasn't easy conditions it was nice to
finally get out there and play.''
	   Moving cautiously, Sampras broke at love to lead 3-1, and a
forehand winner left him serving for the first set at 5-1. Black
broke for 5-2 when Sampras committed his only double-fault of the
match, but Sampras took the set on his fourth set point in the next
game.
	   In the second set, Sampras broke to lead 3-1, but some fine
returns helped Black break back for 3-2. A backhand into the net
from Black gave Sampras a 5-3 lead, and he closed out the match
with a service winner.
	   U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter, continuing a match suspended
from Wednesday, lost 4-6, 7-5, 6-4 to fellow Australian Scott
Draper. Draper also beat Michael Chang at the same stage last year.
	   The third-seeded Rafter failed to match Draper's excellent
serving, good returns and crisp volleys.
	   ``I guess I'm just finding it hard mentally at the moment. It's
very difficult and very hard,'' Rafter said. ``I'm trying to get up
and everything, but I'm finding it very difficult out there at the
moment.
	   ``I lose my confidence very quickly, I'm someone who does that,
so at this stage I'm as flat as I've ever been in my career,'' he
added.
	   In other matches:
	   Britain's Tim Henman, seeded No. 7, beat Sargis Sargsian 6-3,
6-4; No. 10 Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia downed Peter Tramacchi of
Australia 6-4, 3-6, 6-1; Brett Steven of New Zealand, seeded No.
13, overwhelmed Arnaud Clement of France 6-2, 6-1 and No. 14 Byron
Black of Zimbabwe outlasted American Jan-Michael Gambill 5-7, 6-4,
6-4.

	   INDEPENDENT television station iTV and Thai Rath newspaper,
heavyweights in the broadcasting and print media respectively,
Wednesday exchanged more punches in a verbal battle to expose the
professional wrongs of one another.
	   Devoting a portion of its evening news programme to rebut a
latest accusation, iTV lashed out at Thai Rath for further attempts
to rally the public by distorted reports.
	   It pointed out that the station management had constructed 12
relay stations and three temporary relay facilities to enlarge its
broadcasting coverage, a reference to the newspaper's accusation
that the station was responsible for the failure to ensure the
relay of its broadcasts.
	   In Wednesday's edition, the daily argued that iTV had no
justification to ask for a delay in royalty fee payment. Although
the station reasoned that the bureaucratic wrangling had delayed
its development of broadcasting network, the concession contract
stipulated that it had to develop relay stations should the state
fail to help it operate on government land.
	   iTV countered that it had set up as many relay stations as
possible under government regulations while waiting for more than a
year for permission from the Public Relations Department to use its
facilities.
	   The independent television station and the mass-circulation
daily have been bickering over the government review of an iTV
petition to defer the Bt300 million instalment payment which is due
on July 3.
	   The daily charged that iTV was trying to escape the payment
while the station retorted that Thai Rath had resorted to
underhanded tactics of information manipulation to discredit it.
	   iTV Wednesday reiterated that it would honour its concession
contract to pay Bt25.2 billion over the 30-year period to the state
coffers and that the first instalment of Bt300 million would be
paid in accordance with conditions determined by the government.
	   Meanwhile, PM's Office Minister Supatra Masdit is planning to
push for a radio and television act through Parliament when it
reconvenes later this month.
	   She was speaking after a meeting Wednesday of a sub-committee on
frequencies in accordance with the Constitution's Article 40.
	   The meeting resolved that an independent body will be set up,
comprising the Council of National Radio and Television Affairs and
the Council of National Telecommunication Affairs.
	   A 13-member selection committee will select members of the two
councils next Wednesday when the committee will also discuss the
two councils' role and authority, Supatra said.
	   The Public Relations Department will organise a public hearing
on the bill in order to improve the draft before the legislation is
tabled before the Cabinet and Parliament.

EU, S. Africa report breakthrough in arduous trade talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union and South Africa
ended two days of talks Thursday reporting a breakthrough in talks
for a free trade agreement that have moved at a snail's pace since
1994.
	   They reported ``new momentum'' albeit too late to enable South
African President Nelson Mandela to sign an accord _ as had been
hoped _ when he meets EU leaders in Cardiff, Wales, next week.
	   Instead, officials expected an accord to be signed in a few
months.
	   In the 19th round of the talks here, South Africa added
industrial products to be covered by a trade accord along with a
faster timetable for cutting or eliminating tariffs on industrial
products.
	   EU negotiator Philip Lowe told reporters that raised coverage of
the free trade deal to 85 percent of trade in industrial goods.
``We have the impression we are entering in a decisive phase,'' he
added.
	   South African negotiator Elias Links said his side now awaits
``a positive reaction'' from the EU.
	   New talks will be held July 14-15 in Pretoria.
	   South Africa seeks a free trade deal to boost an economy
struggling to recover from decades of isolation during the
apartheid era.
	   The talks have been difficult.
	   At French urging, the Europeans have exempted ``sensitive''
farming products that account for 39 percent of South Africa's
agricultural exports to the EU.
	   Fishing and wine are so sensitive for Spain and other EU wine
producers that they have been turned into separate talks.
	   Trade-related issues _ intellectual property rights protection,
fairness in public procurement, maritime transport and trade
safeguard measures _ need more work, Lowe said.
	   On the financial side, he said the EU was pledging
``substantial'' aid to South Africa.
	   The EU wants to ensure a free trade deal does not lead Pretoria
to neglect its neighbors _ Swaziland, Namibia, Botswana and Lesotho
_ that depend heavily on trade with Pretoria.
	   Since 1994, then EU-South Africa talks have gone from one missed
deadline to the next. Next week, the EU leaders hold a regular
meeting in Cardiff, hosted by British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
	   Blair, whose country now holds the EU presidency, has invited
Mandela to Cardiff but that will now be a largely symbolic event as
there will be no trade accord to sign.
	   The EU is pursuing a free trade deal after South Africa objected
to be treated as one of 70 African, Caribbean and Pacific nations
with which the union has special trade links.
	   South Africa is no ordinary African country. Its exports to the
EU exceed dlrs 9 billion a year, almost half the dlrs 22.5 billion
of exports from the 70 ACP nations combined.

	   FINANCE Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda will Friday meet
economists from the country's top two universities to exchange
views on ways to heal the ailing economy.
	   Sources said the finance minister, who is scheduled to return
from the US on the same day, will meet economists from
Chulalongkorn and Thammasat universities at the Queen Sirikit
Convention Centre.
	   The move came after some 30 Thammasat academics suggested
solutions to the economic problems.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai Wednesday gave the green
light for Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi to set up an
economic situation room, dubbed ''war room'' by the press.
	   The establishment of such a room has been opposed by the Finance
Ministry which says certain state secrets may be leaked. However,
the prime minister said there were no secrets these days.
	   In another related development, a top economic adviser to the
prime minister warned Wednesday that the government would be in a
difficult situation if it failed to ease the liquidity crunch in a
few months.
	   Boonchu Rojanastien sounded the warning to stress the need to
use Baan Phitsanuloke as the economic situation room to coordinate
the attempts of all economic ministries to fight the crisis.
	   ''If the government fails to deliver a better performance, it
will be difficult for the administration to remain in office,''
Boonchu said when asked what would happen if the government failed
to resolve economic problems within a few months.
	   ''The government will have to work harder to achieve the goal,
that is, to ease the liquidity crunch.'' Boonchu has proposed using
Baan Phitsanuloke for holding meetings between economic ministers,
especially the finance minister and Supachai, the deputy prime
minister, to coordinate their attempts to tackle the crisis.
	   Supachai supports the idea while Tarrin has yet to comment on
the proposal. It was reported that deputy finance ministers were
opposed to the idea.
	   Boonchu said his idea would have to wait until all sides were
ready to talk about it.
	   Boonchu said the government was now ''on the right track'' for
solving the situation but could not achieve its goal yet due to
external obstacles.
	   ''And all sides need to cooperate to tackle the external
obstacles. There should be clear-cut measures, which should be
agreed upon by ministers concerned. Most of all, the prime minister
needs to know who is doing what so that he will understand the
whole process,'' Boonchu said.
	   Boonchu said his advisory team would try to collect opinions
from all the ministers concerned and present them to the prime
minister.
	   ''The prime minister really worries about the situation but he
is a gentleman so he rarely criticises anyone. As a result, he
needs someone to speak for him. Since I am senior and know the
process, I'll try to coordinate all sides concerned,'' Boonchu
said.

Controversial paternity test on Yves Montand negative
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERRE-ANTOINE SOUCHARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A controversial paternity test on the corpse of
legendary French singer Yves Montand has revealed that a young
woman who claimed he was her father is not his daughter, the
singer's adoptive daughter and judicial sources said Thursday.
	   Throughout his life, Montand had denied that Aurore Drossart,
24, was his daughter and refused to undergo DNA tests to lay the
matter to rest.
	   But after years of trying, Drossart and her mother, Anne, won a
court-ordered exhumation of Montand's corpse from Paris'
Pere-Lachaise cemetery. It was carried out in March.
	   The DNA tests, according to the judicial sources, who spoke on
condition they not be named, were negative.
	   Catherine Allegret, Montand's adopted daughter, said Thursday
evening that finally his family would be able to ``get out of the
nightmare.''
	   ``Montand will be able to rest in peace,'' she told France Info
radio.
	   Allegret is the daughter of Simone Signoret, Montand's companion
of 36 years who died in 1985. The couple had no children. Montand
had a child, Valentin, in 1988 with his companion, Carole Amiel.
	   ``Valentin will be able to grow up in peace,'' Allegret said.
She also said she had read the conclusions of the DNA tests and
they showed Montand was not Drossart's father.
	   ``I am shattered, because I think of the infamy of this
procedure ... the ignominy of this exhumation.'' Allegret said.
There is no reason to be triumphant, she added. ``Because it is so
sad and sordid.''
	   Montand's heirs were horrified by the exhumation six years after
his death.
	   Geneticists at the Institut Medicolegal in Paris compared DNA
from Montand's teeth to that of Drossart's.
	   Montand was beloved in France, where his melancholy love songs
and cabaret-style ditties won him a loyal following. He also
enjoyed a successful film career.
	   Montand died of a massive heart attack in 1991, at age 70, three
days before he was to testify in Drossart's paternity suit.

	   PRACHAKORN Thai dissidents petitioned the Election Commission
Wednesday to prevent their dismissal from the party's executive
board, which is set to expel them.
	   Prachakorn Thai MP Thanusak Lekuthai of Uttaradit said the
party's executive board meeting on Monday violated party
regulations, the political party law and the Constitution.
	   The party's Regulation 43 stipulates that punishing any party
member needs the consent of at least 20 party members. The meeting
on Monday, however, was based on only Sanit Srisamdaeng's proposal.
	   Monday's meeting also violated the party's Regulation 45 which
states that accused members must be given the chance to prove their
innocence.
	   Thanusak said he submitted a recording of the meeting to prove
that the party leader and executive board violated party
regulations and to show that the meeting did not comprise 40 to 50
members as claimed by some party members.
	   Thanusak ruled out seeking emergency protection from the Civil
Court, saying that would be unnecessary since he believed the
Election Commission would take the group's complaint into
consideration.
	   Wisuth Pothan, a member of the Election Commission, said the
commission would investigate whether Thanusak, who is merely a
party member, has the right to lodge a petition. The political
party law states that a party registrar or representative are
entitled to submit a petition.
	   The commission will also summon the concerned parties to testify
before making ruling.

	   THE United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will
be allowed to participate in the administration of all 12 border
camps for displaced Burmese as a ''co-partner'', a senior
government source said Wednesday.
	   However, because of the UNHCR's shortage of staff, it will adopt
a rotation monitoring team so they can effectively provide
assistance for the Burmese, the source said.
	   A proposal detailing the role of the UN agency in the camps has
been drafted by Thai authorities and the UNHCR and submitted to the
National Security Council for final endorsement.
	   The NSC is expected to approve the proposal soon, the source
said.
	   ''The UNHCR will work as a co-partner with Thai authorities from
the beginning, starting with deciding whether the Burmese should be
received into the camps, screening them to determine their status
and registering them,'' the source said.
	   ''Importantly, the UNHCR will cooperate with Thai authorities in
deciding whether to repatriate the Burmese. The agency and Thailand
will decide whether it is timely to send them back, but
repatriation will not be against the will of the Burmese. The joint
mission will also determine whether the areas where the Burmese
will be repatriated are safe,'' the source said.
	   Thailand changed its policy stance earlier this year when Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai publicly announced that he agreed in
principle to the UNHCR playing a greater role in the camps for
displaced Burmese.
	   Previously, the UN agency was refused any role in the camps. Due
to the international organisation's absence, Thai authorities have
often been criticised for their handling of the camps and for
forcibly repatriating the Burmese.
	   ''Thailand has to accept the UNHCR's role in the camps because
we need financial assistance as the country has suffered from the
economic crisis. We cannot handle it by ourselves,'' the source
said.
	   The proposal under consideration by the NSC does not include the
budget the UNHCR will provide for the camps' administration.
	   At present there are 12 Burmese camps situated in four provinces
-- Tak, Mae Hong Son, Kanchanaburi and Ratchaburi -- housing about
96,000 Burmese. The large number of displaced people has caused
problems for Thailand in terms of national security, public health
and social and economic issues.
	   ''In granting the UNHCR a role in the camps we have to recognise
that all the procedures will require more time as it is different
from in the past when Thailand could run everything in the camps
itself,'' the source said.
	   The source added that the UNHCR will not be authorised to
provide security for the camps or refugees, leaving those duties to
voluntary forces, border patrol police and soldiers.

Brazilians celebrate 2-1 victory over Scotland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilians reacted with criticism
as well as euphoria to their team's 2-1 victory over Scotland in
the opening game of the World Cup.
	   As they looked forward to Brazil's next game, against Morocco,
many fans noted that their team did not dominate Scotland as they
had expected.
	   The team's performance ``left much to be desired,'' O Estado de
Sao Paulo reported.
	   The game on Wednesday brought the country to a standstill.
Streets emptied, trading on the stock market halted and banks
closed. On Thursday, many Brazilians were second-guessing their
team's performance.
	   ``Collectively the team did not overpower Scotland, but it did
not disappoint either. For an opening game, it was reasonable,''
said soccer columnist Armando Nogueira.
	   Other critics were more skeptical.
	   ``The team showed its weaknesses in its defense, with dangerous
spaces on both sides that the Scots penetrated. Its midfield did
not protect the defense with the same efficiency of the 1994 World
Cup. Its attack was not capable of making key plays that explored
the potential of Ronaldo,'' columnist Luis Augusto Veloso wrote in
Jornal dos Sports. Ronaldo is Brazil's standout player.
	   ``The team started with a victory that showed its mistakes but
it also showed great potential,'' wrote Matinas Suzuki Jr., a
critic for Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper.
	   Players' relatives also chimed in.
	   ``I am hoping that the team will improve a little for its next
game,'' said Edelceu Verri, the father of team captain Dunga, as
quoted in the daily Jornal do Brasil.
	   Coach Mario Zagallo has not announced who will start in next
week's game against Morocco.

	   Government spokesman Akhapol Sorasuchart take note: the
government campaign to discourage people from buying and drinking
imported wine has apparently fallen on deaf ears -- if the surge in
sales of the produce can be of an indicator.
	   Visuth Pongviratchai, deputy managing director of Berli Jucker
Plc, proudly said that compared with last year the wine sales have
increased by 18 per cent over the first five months of this year.
	   ''The growth is beyond our expectations. Actually the sale
volume is about 45 per cent more than we initially expected,'' he
said.
	   Visuth says the company has set to earn Bt160 million from
selling the wine this year.
	   While many groups are campaigning for austerity and conservation
of energy by coaxing people to buy environmentally-friendly
products, well-known singer and songwriter Su Boonliang thinks
otherwise.
	   ''We should look from our inner self. I think we should start
with conserving our own feelings. If we could do that, we would not
long for something extravagant or unnecessary,'' he said.
	   Su said many groups who proclaimed themselves as
environmentalists often came to him to sell their products like pa
khao ma and cotton fabric. But he always refused to buy.
	   ''When I said no, they were mad at me. They said I wasn't a true
environmentalist. But I told them why I had to buy the products. I
already have what they were trying to sell to me. Why should I have
more?'' he said.
	   Parliament President and New Aspiration Party deputy leader Wan
Mohammad Noor Matha is regarded as a respected politician who
hardly relies on recrimination against his opponents.
	   In a recent campaign in the South, however, he unexpectedly lost
his control. His target is no one else but the Democrat Party --
the NAP's arch enemy.
	   Ironically, however, his harsh comments against the Democrats
over vote-buying also forced him to confess that the NAP also
resorted to such a dirty tactic.
	   ''I am not brazen enough to deny that there is no single NAP MP
who didn't buy votes. ... There are such cases in our party,
however, the Democrats blatantly said that they didn't do this even
though there is a tape-cassette to prove the incident,'' he said.
	   Kraisak Chonhavan, normally prefers to remain low-profile, but
each time he broke his silence, every one listened.
	   In his obituary to his father, the late former prime minister
Gen Chatichai Choonhavan, Kraisak caught the attention of readers
with shocking details about Chatichai's operation at Cromwell
Hospital in London.
	   ''It was commotion as I saw doctors and nurses scurrying inside
the room. Some of them managed to close a curtain. It prompted me
to think something might have gone wrong with my father.
	   ''Once I was allowed to enter the room, I saw a pool of blood
oozing from his neck [on which Chatichai earlier had a
tracheotomy]. At first, I didn't know what had happened. But
doctors told me later that there was a mistake during an operation
-- a needle used to puncture his liver mistakenly pierced his lung.
His vital organs subsequently stop functioning,'' he wrote.
	   Earlier Kraisak regretted that his father had not been
hospitalised in Thailand. He also said that he agreed with Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai, who asked him why Chatichai did not seek
medical treatment inside the country.

	   MULHOUSE, France (AP) _ A French pizzeria owner suspected of
killing a couple and stuffing them and their dog into a car trunk
confessed Thursday and was charged with murder.
	   Charles Cretello, 46, also known by his nickname Charlie, owned
the pizzeria where Angela and Alain Hay had lunch April 2, 1996
near the border between Switzerland and France, said police
commissioner Christian Aghroum.
	   Murder charges were brought against Cretello on Thursday in
Mulhouse, a city in Alsace not far from where the couple was
killed, after his confession.
	   Cretello had served 11 years of a 20-year sentence for
involuntary homicide. His son, Christophe, 27, was arrested
Thursday on grounds he allegedly helped his father kill the couple.
	   The Hays had moved to Mulhouse from Le Havre in Normandy in 1996
and set up a business importing luxury cars from Germany, and
apparently had made a good deal of money.
	   Their Mercedes was found in a canal in Alsace a month after
their death. The couple and their dog had been shot and shoved in
the trunk of the car.

EU, S. Africa report breakthrough in arduous trade talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union and South Africa
ended two days of talks Thursday reporting a breakthrough in talks
for a free trade agreement that have moved at a snail's pace since
1994.
	   They reported ``new momentum'' albeit too late to enable South
African President Nelson Mandela to sign an accord _ as had been
hoped _ when he meets EU leaders in Cardiff, Wales, next week.
	   Instead, officials expected an accord to be signed in a few
months.
	   In the 19th round of the talks here, South Africa added
industrial products to be covered by a trade accord along with a
faster timetable for cutting or eliminating tariffs on industrial
products.
	   EU negotiator Philip Lowe told reporters that raised coverage of
the free trade deal to 85 percent of trade in industrial goods.
``We have the impression we are entering in a decisive phase,'' he
added.
	   South African negotiator Elias Links said his side now awaits
``a positive reaction'' from the EU.
	   New talks will be held July 14-15 in Pretoria.
	   South Africa seeks a free trade deal to boost an economy
struggling to recover from decades of isolation during the
apartheid era.
	   The talks have been difficult.
	   At French urging, the Europeans have exempted ``sensitive''
farming products that account for 39 percent of South Africa's
agricultural exports to the EU.
	   Fishing and wine are so sensitive for Spain and other EU wine
producers that they have been turned into separate talks.
	   Trade-related issues _ intellectual property rights protection,
fairness in public procurement, maritime transport and trade
safeguard measures _ need more work, Lowe said.
	   On the financial side, he said the EU was pledging
``substantial'' aid to South Africa.
	   The EU wants to ensure a free trade deal does not lead Pretoria
to neglect its neighbors _ Swaziland, Namibia, Botswana and Lesotho
_ that depend heavily on trade with Pretoria.
	   Since 1994, then EU-South Africa talks have gone from one missed
deadline to the next. Next week, the EU leaders hold a regular
meeting in Cardiff, hosted by British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
	   Blair, whose country now holds the EU presidency, has invited
Mandela to Cardiff but that will now be a largely symbolic event as
there will be no trade accord to sign.
	   The EU is pursuing a free trade deal after South Africa objected
to be treated as one of 70 African, Caribbean and Pacific nations
with which the union has special trade links.
	   South Africa is no ordinary African country. Its exports to the
EU exceed dlrs 9 billion a year, almost half the dlrs 22.5 billion
of exports from the 70 ACP nations combined.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Striking teachers clashed with police
outside schools around Greece on Thursday, leaving at least 13
people injured, media said.
	   The strikers were protesting new examinations introduced for
qualified teachers who wish to be appointed to state-run schools.
They say their university degrees should be the only qualification
necessary.
	   Under the previous system, teachers had to wait for years before
they received a state job.
	   A firebomb exploded outside a bank on a central Athens street,
moments after a teachers' demonstration had passed by late
Thursday.
	   The small blast, caused by a propane gas canister, damaged the
Agricultural Bank's automatic teller machine but caused no
injuries, police said.
	   Teachers began a 48-hour strike to coincide with the start of
examinations on Friday, and have attempted to occupy schools where
they are set to take place in an effort to disrupt the tests.

	   DEMOCRAT secretary-general Sanan Kachornprasart gave a strong
hint Wednesday that the next election could take place before
year-end and asked his party's northern faction to get ready for a
tough fight with tycoon Thaksin Shinawatra's new party.
	   ''We have to be prepared, although the Election Commission will
not be ready for a new poll until after six months,'' Interior
Minister Sanan said.
	   He met northern MPs of the Democrat Party Wednesday to discuss
poll preparations and the emergence of Thaksin's party which is
expected to become a new political gravity attracting potential
defectors from other camps.
	   A source said Sanan also wanted to check whether any Democrat MP
from the North was toying with the idea of joining Thaksin, who has
shown serious intention to conquer the upper region by wooing
veteran Narong Wongwan, believed to still have a lot of political
influence there.
	   Narong, who led several parties and was once a premiership
candidate before a US visa controversy cut short his future, has
confirmed that Thaksin wanted him to become a top adviser of the
new party.
	   Sanan denied he was concerned that Thaksin's party would pose a
big threat in the North, but added that the Democrats were not
being complacent.
	   ''This is a routine meeting. We have to always prepare ourselves
for the next election. And when there's a new wave approaching the
arena, we will have to know how to handle it,'' he said.
	   Deputy Democrat leader Tirdpong Jayananda has been appointed to
be the party's flag bearer in the North, where the Democrats hope
to sweep at least 40 seats. The party currently has 21 seats in the
region.
	   ''We are ready for the battle,'' Sanan said.
	   Regarding candidates in the party list system, Sanan said the
list is now 80 per cent complete. ''When it is unveiled, there will
be oohs and aahs,'' he said.
	   Tirdpong admitted that the North would become one of the
fiercest battlegrounds because no party has been able to dominate
the region.
	   Democrat spokeswoman Ladawan Wongsriwong said the party was not
worried about Thaksin's popularity, saying the tycoon's political
clout was not quite established yet in the North. But she added
that Thaksin's financial power could turn things around.
	   Meanwhile, Social Action leader Montree Pongpanit Wednesday
denied news reports he planned to quit politics, and said he would
be ready to join the Cabinet if Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai wanted
to revamp his government. Montree currently does not hold a Cabinet
position.
	   Flanked at a news conference by key party members who also
reaffirmed their loyalty, Montree said he would run in the next
election under the SAP's banner.
	   ''I won't dissolve the party,'' he said. ''I will continue to
lead it and I'm ready to join the Cabinet if there's a reshuffle.''
He said the ''rumours'' about him quitting politics could have
stemmed from a meeting in which he asked senior SAP members who
would replace him should he leave the political scene.
	   ''It was a tongue-in-cheek comment,'' Montree claimed.
	   However, he said that senior party members, including Public
Health Minister Rakkiat Sukthana and Somsak Kiatsuranont, later
told him that they and many other SAP MPs would leave the party if
he (Montree) was no longer its leader.
	   At the press conference, Montree attacked Thaksin and said there
was no way SAP MPs would join the new party.
	   ''I am putting my head at stake, or I can bet with anything. My
MPs will never join such a polluted party. But if he really wants
my MPs, he can come to ask me nicely,'' said Montree.
	   Rakkiat said that as long as Montree remained SAP's leader,
''all SAP MPs, including myself, will never defect''.

	   A ROW over the appointment of a new abbot at Pantai Norasing
Temple in Samut Sakhon has given rise to doubts about the merits of
a convention in which a lay-cum-clerical congregation chooses
leaders of private Buddhist temples.
	   Monks at the temple have proposed dropping the selection
convention and adopting the one used by government temples to
appoint its leader and plans to propose the idea at a nationwide
conference of clerical leaders on Monday.
	   The Education Ministry has proposed a review of the existing
Buddhist clergy laws so that clerical leadership appointments are
free from clerical politics.
	   After the former abbot of the temple stepped down amid reports
of being illiterate and hence unsuitable for such a high post. A
convention was then held to chose a new abbot, with two main
candidates -- Phra Chansak Uttamo and Phra Preecha Dhammo, both 36
-- in the fray.
	   Chansak, six years junior to Preecha in the monkhood, is a
secular Buddhist scholar and holds a bachelor's degree before
joining the monkhood. Preecha, on the other hand, has been a monk
for the past 12 years.
	   Thirteen of the temple's 30 monks voted for Chansak while eight
favoured Preecha. Chansak was also said to be the preferred choice
of the temple's lay officials.
	   When the dice was cast, squabbling followed, complete with
bitter accusations of vote-buying against Chansak.
	   The squabbling turned so ugly that the provincial ecclesiastic
chief suggested that instead of their selection criteria the
provincial clergy method of choosing a new government temple leader
be adopted.
	   Phra Somsak Apha, a monk at Pantai Norasing temple, said
Wednesday that the clerical row was triggered by yearning for power
and wealth -- this despite Lord Buddha's teaching and Buddhist
clerical precepts forbidding such rows.
	   Another monk Phra Thaworn said that the majority of the clergy
and the lay temple officials had opted for Chansak because of his
merits while his defectors ''tried to discredit him''.
	   Now that the provincial clerical chief has officially declared
Chansak as the valid abbot of the temple any accusations against
him would come to nothing, he added.
	   Phra Srithirapong, the provincial clerical chief, said the
provincial clergy had deliberated on the issue for one month before
deciding in favour of Chansak.
	   He said he planned to suggest that private temples adopt the
government temple method when it comes to appointing a new clerical
leader.
	   In a government temple appointment, the provincial clergy alone
decides on who to appoint as the clerical leader without allowing
lay officials any say in the matter, Phra Srithirapong said. He
added that this method will work only if the provincial clergy has
integrity of character.
	   Deputy Education Minister Akhom Engchuan, meanwhile, said
Wednesday that he planned to propose a review of the current laws
on the appointment of Buddhist clerical leaders.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Dame Catherine Cookson, whose novels about working
class hardships in 19th century England made her one of Britain's
most popular writers, died Wednesday at 91.
	   Her agent Anthony Shiel said she died at her home in Jesmond
Dene, a suburb of Newcastle, but he did not immediately know the
cause of death. Mrs. Cookson suffered for many years from a rare
blood disease and required frequent hospitalization. She had a
heart attack in 1990.
	   The author of 100 books that sold more than 100 million copies
in 18 languages, she began life in poverty in the Tyneside area of
northeast England, worked as a laundress in a workhouse and did not
begin writing until she was 40.
	   Shiel said she had contiuned to write until a couple of months
ago and that her 100th book was to be published in the year 2000.
	   ``She kept her mind and mental strength until the end,'' he
said, and although she had a long-term illness, ``she was
reasonably well until a few weeks ago.''
	   Catherine Cookson's strong plots and characters captured an
audience immediately. Her stories have been made into television
films and a play and are by far the best-read books in British
libraries. The Public Lending Right, which tracks public library
use, said she was the most-borrowed author in Britain in 1996-97;
and of the 10 most borrowed books, nine were hers.
	   ``She was a wonderful writer of popular fiction,'' said fellow
best-selling author Barbara Taylor Bradford. ``A lot of people
didn't understand how difficult that is to do.
	   ``She had a great insight into people and what made them tick.
... ``I think she did what a novelist was supposed to do. She
entertained, she brought human emotion to the paper.''
	   Her recurrent themes of family devotion and the struggle to
escape from poverty are laced with romance, but Mrs. Cookson
resented being referred to as a romantic novelist.
	   ``I am not a romantic writer. ... Those sloppy, silly stories,''
she once said. ``A strong, storytelling novelist is what I am.''
	   Among the most popular of her books are her first, ``Kate
Hannigan,'' ``A Dinner of Herbs,'' the ``Mallen'' trilogy, and
``Bill Bailey.'' ``The Black Candle,'' ``The Black Velvet Gown''
and ``The Fifteen Streets,'' have been made into television films,
and the last was staged as a play in London in 1988.
	   ``Our Kate,'' an autobiography published in 1968, detailed her
beginnings as Kate McMullen, the illegitimate daughter of a young
working class woman who turned to drink.
	   She was born June 20, 1906 in Tyne Dock and grew up in nearby
East Jarrow, on the outskirts of Newcastle.
	   ``I went into the workhouse as a laundry checker when I was
18,'' Mrs. Cookson once said. ``My wage was 2 pounds (dlrs 3.20 at
current rates) a month plus four square meals a day and a free
uniform.''
	   After years of work in laundries she saved enough money to move
to Hastings, south of London, where she married teacher Tom Cookson
in 1940.
	   During the war they lived in St. Albans, 20 miles (30 kms) north
of London, in an apartment opposite the library. ``I took a book
every day,'' she said.
	   She taught herself to write, and put on no airs about it. ``I
have always looked upon writing as a trade,'' she once said. ``I
simply apprenticed myself to it.''
	   In 1985 she was made an Officer of the British Empire, or OBE,
and was made a dame _ the equivalent of a knight _ in 1993.
	   She is survived by her husband. Funeral arrangements were not
announced.
	   Much of her income went to charity, directly or through the
Catherine Cookson Charitable Trust, especially to universities and
to hospitals in northeast England.
	   ``The kind generosity of Catherine Cookson over the years
enabled a great deal of health care, development and research to be
brought about that would otherwise not have been possible,'' said
Len Fenwick, chief executive of Newcastle Hospitals Trust. ``The
work that she funded will continue to pay testament to her
generosity for years to come.''

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ About 100 frightened Ethiopians hovered
outside their embassy Thursday, pleading for travel documents to
escape hatred against them that has surged with Ethiopia-Eritrea
fighting.
	   ``I want to go home,'' one desperate young Ethiopian cried
through a locked, grillwork fence. ``I'm afraid.''
	   Eritrean aircraft bombed the northern Ethiopian town of Adigrat
on Thursday, killing at least one person and wounding three, while
ground troops clashed on two fronts.
	   With the clashes spreading, tensions were high among many of the
100,000 Ethiopians living in Eritrea, plus hundreds of migrant
workers attracted by construction and domestic work.
	   Most are from Ethiopia's northern province of Tigray, whose
people many Eritreans blame for the conflict. Many Tigrayans
complain they have been insulted by Eritreans, who call them
``Agame,'' the name of a region of Tigray that has come to mean
beggar or traitor.
	   Amanuel Madera Hagas, a construction worker, said he was fired
and kicked out of his home when the conflict broke out last month,
and is now hungry and sleeping on the streets.
	   ``I want to go home,'' he said. But he lost his travel pass, and
was among the crowd waiting for the overworked embassy to provide
replacement papers. Other Ethiopians say Eritrean soldiers have
torn up their identity papers.
	   The embassy, overworked and understaffed, has issued 500 pass
cards in a week. As in much of Africa, many Ethiopians do not have
passports and are allowed to travel with idenity cards or travel
passes.
	   Even those with the proper papers have been unable to leave.
Nine buses have been turned back at the Adiqual border post on the
way to Tigray, for security concerns, the government said.
	   Most Ethiopians in Eritrea apparently are staying, for the time
being.
	   ``I've lived here for a long time and have had no problems,''
said an Ethiopian accountant who has been in Eritrea for 58 of his
72 years. But he was uneasy and did not want to be named.
	   In Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian government has accused Eritrea of
expelling 3,000 Ethiopians, a charge denied in Asmara.
	   Ethiopian officials also informed the Eritrean Foreign Ministry
that 19 Ethiopians have been missing since hostilities began last
month, including the vice chairman of the Tigray Development
Association and the vice president and secretary of the Ethiopian
Community.
	   A driver for the now-closed Ethiopian Consulate in the port of
Massawa, was released Thursday from one week of arrest. Police
arrested the embassy's driver in Asmara Thursday morning.
	   Yemane Gebremeskel, presidential spokesman, countered that
Ethiopia has detained and interrogated at least 20 staff members of
the Eritrean Embassy in Addis Ababa since Sunday.
	   Neither government has any comment on the other's charges of
arrests.
	   Each has expelled the majority of the other's diplomats and
their families. Just two are allowed in each country.
	   Yemane said the government has broadcast messages on state-run
radio urging Eritreans to respect Ethiopians. ``We are categorical
about this, Ethopians will not be persecuted because they are
Ethopians,'' he said.
	   At least one Ethiopian was badly beaten June 5 after an
Ethiopian warplanes bombed the military-civilian airport.

	   THE Physical Education Department, which enforces disciplinary
regulations on students outside their schools, has set up six
hotline centres to receive complaints about minors involved in
soccer gambling.
	   PED director-general Thongkhoon Hongphan said the centres, each
of which has its own six-digit phone number, are located in major
areas throughout Bangkok and will operate between 8 am and 8 pm
until July 14, three days after the World Cup ends.
	   He added that all of the department's 57 inspectors, as well as
1,200 volunteers, will be sent onto city streets and to major youth
hangouts during the centres' operating hours to ensure constant
surveillance.
	   For anyone with concerns, the Wisutharom centre's number is
215-8221, the Ban Kluay centre, 391-7340; the Khlong Jan centre,
377-3508; the Don Muang centre, 566-4873; the Thon Burirom centre,
465-9286; and the Bang Khae centre, 809-2558.
	   Shrimp farms given reprieve PRIME Minister Chuan Leekpai has
refused to sign an order banning inland shrimp farming issued by
the Science Ministry, Deputy Science Minister Pornthep Tejapaibul
said Wednesday.
	   The premier said he wanted more information about inland shrimp
farming before signing the order, Pornthep said.
	   ''He said that there is nothing clear about the environmental
impact of the farming and the House committee on agriculture has
warned him about the economic impact if he signs the order,''
Pornthep said.
	   The National Environment Board decided to ban inland shrimp
farming in the central region on June 3, but the resolution will
not take effect until Chuan signs the order. Under Article 9 of the
Environmental Act of 1992, the premier has the authority to ban any
activities considered harmful to the environment and ecosystem.
	   Shrimp farming has gained rapid popularity in the central
region. Many paddy fields have been converted into shrimp farms,
which cause soil salinity and pollute canals with waste water.
	   Naked parade condemned OFFICIALS at the Thanyaburi
Rehabilitation Centre were wrong to force female vagrants to walk
naked from their living quarters to shower rooms, the House
committee on justice and human rights concluded Wednesday.
	   The panel also urged the Public Welfare Department, which
oversees the centre, to officially look into the incident and
punish officials responsible, Muk Sulaiman, a committee member,
said.
	   He said several residents petitioned the committee for a
transfer to new centres located in or nearby their home provinces,
and asked the department to also consider their requests.
	   The June 1 incident, in which naked female residents were seen
queuing outside shower rooms at the Pathum Thani centre, drew heavy
criticisms from the public and media.
	   Maths skills to be upgraded THE National Primary Education
Commission (NPEC) has set up a panel aimed at improving the
mathematic skills of students, Prayad Songkun, deputy
secretary-general of the commission, said Wednesday.
	   Prayad said the panel wants to put students' maths skills on a
par with those in developed countries.
	   The panel comprises educators from the NPEC, the Provincial
Primary Education Commission, the District Primary Education
Commission and assistant school heads and maths teachers.
	   The team will create teaching materials such as handbooks to
advise teachers on new teaching techniques and breakthroughs in
subjects such as ''maths through imagination''.
	   The team will also write maths tests and songs for teachers to
use in the classroom.
	   Jobless to repair footpaths A PROJECT to put the unemployed to
work repairing Bangkok's treacherous sidewalks will officially
commence soon after the recent approval of funding, a senior
Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) official said Wednesday.
	   Yothin Thongkham said Bt25 million would be distributed
throughout 50 city districts to implement the project. He said the
BMA also plans to include other works -- such as canal dredging and
roadside drain cleaning -- in similar projects.
	   However, he said the repair work failed in a pilot programme
carried out in eight districts because most workers were unskilled
and some neglected their work.
	   Yothin, director of the BMA's Department of Community
Development, said an unemployment centre has been set up to help
job seekers coordinate themselves.
	   He invited any jobless people with the same skills to make up a
10-member group and register with the centre at any district office
to become a legal entity and contest jobs to be opened under future
assistance programmes.

	   Yemane Gebremeskel, presidential spokesman, countered that
Ethiopia has detained and interrogated at least 20 staff members of
the Eritrean Embassy in Addis Ababa since Sunday.
	   Neither government has any comment on the other's charges of
arrests.
	   Each has expelled the majority of the other's diplomats and
their families. Just two are allowed in each country.
	   Yemane said the government has broadcast messages on state-run
radio urging Eritreans to respect Ethiopians. ``We are categorical
about this, Ethopians will not be persecuted because they are
Ethopians,'' he said.
	   At least one Ethiopian was badly beaten June 5 after an
Ethiopian warplanes bombed the military-civilian airport.

Three detained in killing of opposition editor

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three people, including a former employee of a
regional administration, have been detained in connection with the
slaying of an opposition editor earlier this week, a news agency
reported Thursday.
	   Larisa Yudina, editor of the Soviet Kalmykia Today newspaper and
regional co-chairman of the liberal opposition Yabloko party,
disappeared Sunday after leaving her home in Elista, capital of the
Kalmyk Republic in southern Russia.
	   The editor was found dead Monday, with multiple knife wounds and
a fractured skull, Russian media have reported.
	   Citing investigators in the case, the Interfax news agency said
that among the three suspects detained was a former employee in
Kalmyk President Kirsan Yulimzhinov's administration.
	   Investigators haven't ruled out that the killing resulted from
``hooliganism'' or a robbery attempt, Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported
Thursday. But the Yabloko party, headed by economist Grigory
Yavlinsky, and most Moscow newspapers have alleged that it was
politically motivated.
	   The Paris-based Reporters Without Borders organization sent a
letter to Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday urging him to
ensure Yudina's killers are punished.
	   The group said that nearly 30 reporters have been killed in
Russia since it gained independence in 1991, either because of
their views or while practicing their profession.
	   It said that Soviet Kalmykia Today has often been threatened
with closure by authorities and that Yudina has received threats
because of her articles about the wealth and personality of
Yulimzhinov.
	   ``Who killed the journalist isn't yet known,'' wrote the
Izvestiya daily in a commentary. ``But it doesn't take a composite
sketch to recognize in this political face the familiar traits of
the totalitarian regime, where both people and laws have no
rights.''

	   MULHOUSE, France (AP) _ A French pizzeria owner suspected of
killing a couple and stuffing them and their dog into a car trunk
confessed Thursday and was charged with murder.
	   Charles Cretello, 46, also known by his nickname Charlie, owned
the pizzeria where Angela and Alain Hay had lunch April 2, 1996
near the border between Switzerland and France, said police
commissioner Christian Aghroum.
	   Murder charges were brought against Cretello on Thursday in
Mulhouse, a city in Alsace not far from where the couple was
killed, after his confession.
	   Cretello had served 11 years of a 20-year sentence for
involuntary homicide. His son, Christophe, 27, was arrested
Thursday on grounds he allegedly helped his father kill the couple.
	   The Hays had moved to Mulhouse from Le Havre in Normandy in 1996
and set up a business importing luxury cars from Germany, and
apparently had made a good deal of money.
	   Their Mercedes was found in a canal in Alsace a month after
their death. The couple and their dog had been shot and shoved in
the trunk of the car.

World Cup: England, at last, is healthy; Hoddle likens Owen to
</HEADLINE>
Ronaldo &QL; 
 &UR; By MORLEY MYERS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ Manchester United defender Gary Neville
and Tottenham striker Les Ferdinand underwent a full training
session Thursday, leaving England's 22-strong World Cup squad at
full strength for the first time since manager Glenn Hoddle
announced his roster.
	   Neville injured his calf Tuesday during England's exhibition
match against French second division club Caen, while Ferdinand was
suffering from an Achilles tendon problem.
	   ``It's always nice to have a clean bill of health,'' Hoddle
said. ``You see and hear about a few problems here and there in the
other camps.
	   ``We have had our fair share of problems on the injury front
coming into big, vital games. I hope this is the reverse, a bit of
good fortune going into the most important games of our lives. That
would be a significant way for us to do well in this tournament.''
	   Hoddle has already decided on his lineup for England's opening
Group G match against Tunisia in Marseille on Monday.
	   ``I know what my 11 is _ as long as everyone is fit,'' he said.
	   Hoddle would not reveal his selection, but hinted 18-year-old
Michael Owen was a likely starter in preference to Teddy Sheringham
as partner to No. 1 striker Alan Shearer.
	   Hoddle said the Liverpool teenager had the talent and the
temperament to handle such a big match.
	   ``His temperament is smashing, way above his years. What he
still lacks is experience at this level, but young Michael is
learning quickly and is an exciting prospect,'' Hoddle said.
	   ``He is a talent who can start and cause people problems and
influence the game. We have to find out whether he can do it at
World Cup level.
	   ``He has a fresh, alive, youthful feel about him. He has genuine
pace with the ball and without the ball. He also has good movement,
way above his age for a striker. He can also come and run and turn
players just like Ronaldo.''
	   Owen felt flattered at being likened to the Brazilian star.
	   ``It is nice to be compared to him or any great player. I like
to run at players like Ronaldo does, but I have a lot to do before
I get to his standard,'' Owen said.
	   Owen, who celebrated his debut as England's youngest
international by scoring the winning goal in a 1-0 victory over
Morocco on April 22, was not nervous at the prospect of playing in
the World Cup.
	   ``You don't go in fearful of anyone,'' he said. ``You go in
knowing you can cause problems. You don't look at the players'
positive points, you look at their weaknesses and try to see where
you can hurt them most.''
	   Asked if he had any faults following the glowing tributes from
his manager, Owen replied: ``I hate to lose.''

World Cup: Baggio penalty earns 2-2 tie for Italy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more Maldini quotes, fans reaction to dubious
penalty, fixes referee's nationality &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Pres Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Roberto Baggio, whose last World Cup
penalty cleared the crossbar and handed the trophy to Brazil four
years ago, fired in a spot kick six minutes from the end to salvage
a 2-2 tie against Chile Thursday.
	   The veteran striker, recalled to the Italian lineup at age 31
after playing only one game in three years, coolly slotted the ball
past goalkeeper Nelson Tapia from the penalty spot after Ronald
Fuentes' right arm couldn't get out of the way of a Baggio cross.
	   The dubious penalty touched off irate boos and jeers from
thousands of Chilean fans who outnumbered Italian supporters both
in number and enthusiasm at Bordeaux' Lescure stadium.
	   Chile was leading 2-1 thanks to two stunning strikes by Marcelo
Salas, after Christian Vieri had given Italy a 10th minute lead off
a Baggio sideways pass.
	   Baggio's late spot kick brought back memories of World Cup '94.
The former Juventus and AC Milan star, now moving from Bologna to
Inter Milan, carried Italy game after game in the United States
with his goals, some of them late in the game or in overtime.
	   But he couldn't hit the target in the penalty shootout that
followed a scoreless final against Brazil in Pasadena. Baggio fired
over the top and Brazil won the title for a record fourth time.
	   ``What happened four years ago doesn't count right now,'' said
Italy's coach, Cesare Maldini. ``I was pleased with the team's
reaction and its thirst for a goal.''
	   Italy, playing in all-white, took the lead with a stunning
counter-attack after Ivan Zamorano, who ironically plays for Inter
Milan, lost possession deep in the Italian half.
	   Vieri and Baggio were well advanced with only two Chilean
defenders between them and the goal and the 1994 World Cup star
collected a long through ball from Paolo Maldini.
	   Instead of heading for goal, Baggio unselfishly slipped the ball
sideways to the better positioned Vieri who slid it home from 15
yards (meters) with his left foot.
	   Chile, aiming to make the second round for only the second time
in seven attempts, came back into the game strongly and levelled in
the third minute of first half injury time.
	   Fabian Estay swung in a left-wing corner kick, Zamorano powered
in a header, Pedro Reyes touched the ball on and Salas turned to
fire the ball home with his left foot.
	   Four minutes into the second half, Salas, who has signed a
contract to play for Lazio of Rome next season. struck again. He
climbed to a right wing cross, beat Fabio Cannavaro in the air and
powered a header between goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca and the post.
	   Maldini sent on Luigi Di Biagio and Enrico Chiesa for Roberto Di
Matteo and Angelo Di Livio to change the pattern. But the Italians
still looked vulnerable on the counter-attack and frequently were
caught out by high crosses.
	   Filippo Inzaghi went on for Vieri with just under 20 minutes
remaining and he almost tied the game in the 80th.
	   Baggio slipped another clever ball through the Chilean defense
but goalkeeper Tapia was fast off his line and blocked the
striker's first time, close range shot with his legs.
	   Coach Maldini said Italy deserved the draw thanks to the strong
fightback by his players in the last part of the match.
	   ``We certainly had some defensive lapses today and must improve
in view of the next match with Cameroon,'' he said.
	   ``I can't understand the three minutes of injury time given by
the referee, which allowed Chile to score the (first half)
equalizer. I expected a tough first match in the tournament and it
was really difficult for us.''
	   Lineups:
	   Italy _ Gianluca Pagliuca; Alessandro Nesta, Paolo Maldini,
Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Costacurta, Dino Baggio, Angelo Di
Livio (Enrico Chiesa, 61st), Demetrio Albertini, Roberto Di Matteo
(Luigi Di Biagio, 58th), Christian Vieri (Filippo Inzaghi, 71st),
Roberto Baggio.
	   Chile _ Nelson Tapia; Ronald Fuentes, Pedro Reyes, Javier Margas
(Miguel Ramirez, 64th), Moises Villarroel, Francisco Rojas, Nelson
Parraguez, Clarence Acuna (Fernando Cornejo, 82nd), Fabian Estay
(Jose Sierra, 81st), Ivan Zamorano, Marcelo Salas.
	   Referee: Lucian Bouchardeau, Niger.

Graf wins second match of comeback

 &UR; Eds: ADDS Steffi quotes in 8th graf, updates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Steffi Graf took just one hour to
beat Kristie Boogert in straight sets Thursday and advance to the
quarterfinals of the DFS Classic.
	   In her second match in four months, the former world No. 1
player dominated the Dutch qualifier 6-2, 6-4 on another
rain-slowed day at Edgbaston.
	   The top-seeded Graf, wearing warmup pants on a cold and overcast
day, looked sharper than the previous day when she needed three
sets to beat Australia's Rennae Stubbs.
	   Graf is playing in only her third tournament since undergoing
knee surgery a year ago. She is preparing for Wimbledon _ which
starts June 22 _ a tournament she has won seven times.
	   The winner of 21 Grand Slams got a chuckle when told British
bookmakers had made her 4-1 second favorite behind Martina Hingis
to win the Wimbledon crown.
	   ``We'll see,'' she said. ``I do feel confident going into the
tournament but now it's too far ahead to think about winning it.''
	   Graf said her game was more settled Thursday and she was
enjoying tennis playing tennis again after the surgery and nagging
injuries.
	   ``I am serving a bit better but I still have a lot of improving
to do in that department,'' she said.
	   Graf took the first set in 28 minutes with breaks in the third
and seventh games and raced to a 3-0 lead in the second set.
Boogert won three straight games to even the set at 3-3 before Graf
regained command.
	   Graf will meet eighth-seed Magui Serna in the quarterfinals, the
Spaniard advancing after a straight sets win over American Corina
Morariu.
	   Second-seeded Irina Spirlea had to wait four days to play her
first match of the tournament but took just 63 minutes to beat
Canada's Maureen Drake 6-4, 6-2 and advance to the third round.
	   In other third round play, 1997 champion Nathalie Tauziat, of
France, beat Italy's Rita Grande 6-3, 6-0.

Baggio thwarts Chile's upset bid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quote from Italy's coach, Baggio assist on first goal;
will be UPDATED with Cameroon-Austria &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Just as Chile appeared destined to pull the first
major upset of France '98, Roberto Baggio was given a chance at
redemption.
	   Baggio, who missed the penalty kick that ended the World Cup
four years ago, this time found the mark in the 84th minute to lift
Italy to a 2-2 draw with the South Americans on Thursday.
	   Baggio, who made all 11 penalty kicks he took in Italian league
play this year and would not have been in starting lineup were it
not for an injury to Alessandro Del Piero, took the penalty after
defender Ronald Fuentes was whistled for a hand ball in the box.
	   Baggio also assisted on Italy's first goal, scored by Christian
Vieri in the 10th minute.
	   Still, the draw marked another slow start for Italy, which fell
1-0 to Ireland in its opener four years ago before rallying to
become the eventual runner-up to Brazil. Baggio took the final shot
in the penalty shootout against Brazil and missed high.
	   ``What happened four years ago doesn't count right now,'' said
Italy's coach, Cesare Maldini. ``I was pleased with the team's
reaction and its thirst for a goal.''
	   In a game played in intermittent downpours and sunshine in
Bordeaux, Marcelo Salas scored in first-half injury time and in the
49th minute for the Chileans, who have been made it past the first
round only once six previous World Cup appearances _ and that was
when they hosted the tournament in 1962.
	   Salas, who will join Italy's Lazio next season in a dlrs 20
million transfer, scored 11 goals in qualifying play _ two less
than the entire Italian team.
	   Later Thursday, Cameroon and Austria played in another Group B
match in Toulouse. Three games are set for Friday: South
Arabia-Denmark in Lens, France-South Africa in Marseille and
Paraguay-Bulgaria in Montpellier.
	   Japan, in the World Cup for the first time, doesn't open play
until Sunday against Argentina, but that's too soon for many
Japanese fans who bought tickets that have failed to materialize.
	   While five Japanese travel agencies reportedly were deciding to
cancel World Cup tours because some 12,000 tickets haven't turned
up, a group of 76 fans already at the team's training camp at
Aix-en-Provence waited to find out if even that much-smaller number
could be met.
	   ``I'm trying to be optimistic,'' said Masami Tachi, a
34-year-old housewife from Tokyo. ``But if we don't get tickets
soon, we're going to take the tour coordinator hostage. We will not
kill him.''
	   At other training camps, injuries were the main concern.
	   Germany lost defensive midfielder Steffen Freund for at least 10
days with a pulled a muscle in his right calf. He'll likely miss
two games.
	   Forward Nwankwo Kanu practiced with Nigeria for the first time
since the Olympic champions arrived in France, although another
striker, Daniel Amokachi, sat out with a twisted right knee.
	   Meanwhile, the Netherlands became the last of the 32 teams to
arrive in France, taking up residence in Versailles ahead of
Saturday's match against rival Belgium.
	   Injured Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp went through a full _
though not very strenuous _ training session and emerged smiling
and unharmed.
	   ``It is going very well at the moment,'' said Bergkamp, who hurt
his hamstring six weeks ago. ``I do not feel any pain any more.''
	   Spying also became an issue Thursday, with Spanish coach Javier
Clemente venting anger after some photographers attempted to enter
a closed practice session.
	   And Croatia was upset when its own spies were sent away from an
open practice held by Jamaica, its first World Cup opponent.
Croatian soccer federation president Branko Miksa said tournament
rules say no one can be barred from an open practice, not even
officials from other teams.
	   ``We don't want to make a big noise about this, but we will send
a protest to FIFA and the organizing committee,'' he said.
	   And, in a court in Paris, a Scottish soccer fan was sentenced to
a two-month suspended sentence for throwing beer cans at a French
policeman after Tuesday night's pre-Cup parade.
	   Christopher Kyles, 23, of Aberdeen, apologized to the court,
admitted being drunk and said he remembered none of his actions.

	   Q: MY father, who is 84, has diabetes. His feet and legs (up to
the knees) swell. Sometimes, his body itches. The doctors say his
kidneys are not functioning well but the medication they have given
does not seem to help.
	   He is still able to walk but is unsteady.
	   A: THE swelling in your father's legs is probably due to kidney
malfunction. He can improve the circulation to his kidneys with
herbs such as hawthorn and ginkgo. Astragalus may also improve the
function of his kidneys.
	   The itchiness is due to the kidney's failure to properly excrete
uric acid which subsequently builds up in the blood and causes
itchiness.
	   Rhubarb root may help against the kidney failure he is
experiencing due to the diabetes. He should avoid dandelion leaves
and other diuretic herbs rich in postassium as it is likely that he
is not properly excreting this mineral.
	   Antioxidants such as grape seed extract and the nutritional
antioxidants vitamins E and C can also be of great benefit.
	   There have been numerous clinical trials confirming the
effectiveness of grape seed extract (containing compounds known as
OPCs) in improving the strength of the capillaries and therefore
the symptoms of oedema.
	   In an open clinical trial, 78 patients with serious circulatory
problems in the legs received 150mg of OPCs from grape seed per
day.
	   Favourable results were obtained. The strength of the
capillaries normalised in over 30 per cent and improved in a
further 44 per cent of the patients.

Prosecutor says corruption main threat to Russian security
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Corruption is one of the main threats to Russia's
national security, Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov said Thursday.
	   Skuratov told Russian independent television NTV that corruption
was ``rather widespread'' on all government levels, from local to
federal.
	   If law-enforcement agencies continue to ignore the problem, it
could threaten the country's existence, the chief prosecutor said.

	   MALAYSIAN rubber prices continued to weaken further with market
staying quiet on lack of interest from buyers.
	   At the close, July International RSS One dropped three sen to
275.0 sen per kg while SMR 20 shed 4.5 sen to 262.50 sen per kg.
	   Buyers were still not coming in at present, a dealer said.
	   He said prices were likely to fall further as the buyers still
taking a wait-and-see approach.
	   He said prices in the other markets in the region were also
weak.
	   The INRO daily market indicator prices for June 9 fell to 193.66
Malaysian/Singapore cents from 196.89 cents on June 8.

	   JAPANESE share prices closed 1.2 per cent lower yesterday on
steep falls in other Asian stock markets as well as worries about
the adverse impact of the yen's weakness on the region, brokers
said.
	   Sentiment was particularly dampened by further falls in Hong
Kong's Hang Seng index and Red chips, companies listed there by the
mainland interest, brokers said.
	   ``The Hang Seng index, and Red chips, were lower, and Asian
share prices in general were lower today,'' a dealer at Universal
Securities said, adding: ``This weighed on sentiment.''
	   A Kokusai Securities broker said: ``The fall of Hong Kong share
prices is part of the reason for the falls seen here in afternoon
trading.''
	   The key Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange lost 190.91 points to end the day at 15,339.26. The
index was down 107.79 points or 0.7 per cent in the morning
session.
	   The broader Topix index of all first-section issues fell 10.08
points to 1,198.60, with an estimated 340 million shares changing
hands on the major board against 314.9 million shares the previous
day.
	   Brokers said there were not enough buyers on the downside to
absorb the selling pressure.
	   ``Sizable buying from public funds was seen yesterday, but this
is not the case today,'' the Kokusai Securities broker said.
	   ``Share prices did not have a floor on the downside because of
the lack of public fund buying.''

Controversial paternity test on Yves Montand negative
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and ADDS background throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERRE-ANTOINE SOUCHARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The results of a DNA test on the corpse of
legendary French singer Yves Montand show that he did not father a
young woman who for years has claimed to be his love child,
judicial sources said Thursday.
	   ``Montand will be able to rest in peace,'' the singer's adoptive
daughter, Catherine Allegret, later told French radio. She said she
had read the results of the DNA tests which showed Montand was not
the father of Aurore Drossart.
	   Throughout his life, Montand had denied that Drossart, 24, was
his daughter and refused to undergo DNA tests while alive.
	   But after years of trying, Drossart and her mother, Anne, won a
court-ordered exhumation of Montand's corpse from Paris'
Pere-Lachaise cemetery. It was carried out in March. Drossart was
present.
	   Four years ago, a Paris court concluded that Montand was
Aurore's father, on the basis of physical resemblance as well as
the fact the Montand had refused twice to undergo blood tests to
verify the claim.
	   The DNA tests were negative, according to the judicial sources,
who spoke on condition they not be named.
	   Allegret, the adopted daughter, said that finally his family
would be able to ``get out of the nightmare.''
	   Allegret is the daughter of Simone Signoret, Montand's companion
of 36 years who died in 1985. The couple had no children. Montand
had a child, Valentin, in 1988 with his companion, Carole Amiel.
	   ``I am shattered, because I think of the infamy of this
procedure ... the ignominy of this exhumation.'' Allegret said.
There is no reason to be triumphant, she added, ``because it is so
sad and sordid.''
	   Montand's heirs were horrified by the exhumation so long after
his death in 1991.
	   Geneticists at the Institut Medicolegal in Paris compared DNA
from Montand's teeth to that of Drossart's.
	   Montand was beloved in France, where his melancholy love songs
and cabaret-style ditties won him a loyal following. He also was a
versatile screen actor, starring in movies such as Claude Berri's
``Jean de Florette'' and ``Z,'' by Costa Gavras.
	   ``Les Feuilles Mortes,'' translated into English as ``Autumn
Leaves,'' was one of his most famous love songs.
	   Montand died of a massive heart attack at age 70, three days
before he was to testify in Drossart's paternity suit.

Duchess of Kent is shocked by sad living conditions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ The Duchess of Kent expressed her shock
Thursday at the appalling living conditions at a Macedonia center
for physically and mentally disabled children.
	   The Dutchess concluded a three-day visit to Macedonia, where she
came as patron of the Eastern and Central European branch of an
overseas voluntary service organization _ the East European
Partnership.
	   The organization has assisted Macedonian authorities in
providing volunteers to help develop a curriculum for the
integration of children with mental or physical disabilities into
mainstream education.
	   The assistance also extends to small-sized enterprises in the
former Yugoslav republic through a branch called Macedonia Business
Resource Center.
	   ``I was sad and shocked by what I saw ... by the ways and
conditions of living,'' said the Duchess after visiting a
children's center in Demir Kapija, 128 kilometers (80 miles) south
of the capital Skopje.
	   She told reporters at a press conference in Skopje that even the
simplest things were needed, ``chairs, pictures on the walls, music
and toys for children to play with in the yard.''
	   She complimented the Demir Kapija center manager for his efforts
to bring about change and pledged support.
	   The focus of the Duchess's visit were children with special
needs. She also visited a number of institutions in Skopje and met
with some families caring for disabled children at home.
	   She also had courtesy meeting with Macedonian President Kiro
Gligorov and the ministers of education and social welfare.
	   ``This was an enormously warm experience. I have met our
volunteers here and I was impressed by what I saw and what they
have achieved,'' the Duchess said of her visits to schools,
institutions and family homes.

	   BLUE chips fell yesterday on profit-taking and rising interest
rates a day before Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's
testimony to Congress.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 19.68 points (0.22 per
cent) to 9,049.92, as some 564 million shares changed hands, with
1,284 gainers, 1,631 decliners and 570 issues unchanged.
	   On the bond market, where yield and price are inversely related,
there were liquidations ahead of Greenspan's testimony and on fears
that the Bank of Japan could intervene to help the yen, which was
at its lowest level against the dollar in seven years.
	   The average yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond rose
to 5.785 against 5.776 per cent late Monday.
	   Share prices were hurt by concerns about General Motors, as
3,400 workers were on the fifth day of a strike that has paralysed
five of the car maker's plants and slowed production at a sixth.
	   The share price slump will likely be brief and the Dow should
``convincingly'' pass 9,300 points by late 1998, said Goldman Sachs
analyst Abby Joseph Cohen.
	   ``That 9,300 is a number I expect that we will go convincingly
through before the end of 1998,'' said Cohen.
	   Pfizer soared four dollars to 112-7/16, after the Food and Drug
Administration did not revise its safety appraisal of the company's
anti- impotence drug Viagra despite 16 deaths of men who took the
medication.

	   HONG Kong share prices plunged 4.9 per cent yesterday to a more
than three-year low amid concerns over the weakness of the Japanese
yen and higher interbank interest rates, dealers said.
	   ``The falls were mainly due to the weakening of the Japanese yen
and the rising interbank rates,'' said Sean Li, associate director
at Amsteel Securities.
	   The key Hang Seng index fell past the psychological 8,000-point
level, losing 412.09 points to close at 7,979.37 on turnover valued
at 7.154 billion Hong Kong dollars (RM3.67 billion).
	   It was the Hang Seng's lowest level since Feb 7, 1995 when the
index stood at 8,004.01.
	   The index has fallen more than 52 per cent since hitting an
all-time record high of 16,673.27 on Aug 7, 1997.
	   The market opened weakly with the key barometer losing 355.29
points by the end of the morning session.
	   Dealers said investors went on selling spree because of
nervousness in the money markets as the yen, languishing at
seven-year lows, fell past the 141 to the US dollar level.
	   The weakness of the Japanese currency saw the benchmark
three-month Hong Kong interbank offered rate rising briefly to
around 11.0-11.5 per cent from 9.57143 per cent earlier.

	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Concerned that a possible public health
hazard was more important than proper Hindu funeral rites,
government rescue workers lit the funeral pyres Thursday of poor
salt workers, the victims of a cyclone that killed 655 people in
India's western coast.
	   After Hindus die, their oldest son is supposed to light the
pyre. But authorities decided not to wait for their kin to arrive
from distant northern and eastern states because of fears the
bloated corpses would deteriorate in the heat.
	   ``We photographed the bodies for identification later, '' said
Pravin Lehri, a top government official in Gandhinagar, the capital
of Gujarat state.
	   More than 400 of the 435 bodies recovered in Gujarat state's
Kutch district were of salt workers, who stayed in mud and tin roof
houses. Their families lived in native villages thousands of miles
(kilometers) away.
	   These workers built sand walls during high tide to trap sea
water and collected the salt that remained after the water
evaporated. They had no prior warning of Tuesday's cyclone that had
been expected to hit Porbander district, 165 kilometers (100 miles)
to the southwest.
	   The government blamed meteorologists for the deaths.
	   ``We were not aware of the intensity of the cyclone. The
warnings said the storm would not touch Kutch and it suddenly swung
there,'' said federal Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani after
visiting the worst hit areas.
	   More than 20,000 people were evacuated from coastal Gujarat
before the cyclone warning Tuesday. But the salt workers were left
to fend for themselves.
	   On Thursday, army helicopters airdropped food packages to
inaccessible villages where at least 30,000 people were living in
relief camps. They became homeless as nearly 6,000 huts and 1,742
houses were flattened by the cyclone.
	   But food and drinking water have not yet reached many villages
and aid workers warned of an epidemic if rotting corpses were not
disposed.
	   ``The biggest problem is that human bodies are lying around on
the streets with animal carcasses. Nobody is bothered about things
like safe drinking water,'' said Madhusudan Mistry, from Disha, a
welfare group for villagers.
	   Gujarat state was hardest hit with 646 casualties, said Lehri.
The cyclone first hit land with wind speeds of 100 kph (65 mph),
but weakened Wednesday when it moved north to Rajasthan state
killing nine people. It killed 12 people in neighboring Pakistan.
	   Many towns and villages went without power supply for the second
consecutive day, as electricity and telecommunication links could
only partially be restored to 5,000 coastal villages.
	   ``My father said his Anjaar village was still under three feet
(a meter) of water. Many bodies were rotting on trees, roofs or
enmeshed in electric wires,'' said Dashrath Desai, who was able to
call his father.
	   At least six entire coastal villages in the area were swept
away. Other deaths in Gujarat were caused by lightning, wall
collapses or drowning.
	   Two years ago, an even more devastating cyclone, with wind
speeds of more than 160 kph (100 mph), hit India's southeastern
Andhra Pradesh state killing more than 1,000 people.

	   IPOH, Wed. - The State Government is looking into the
possibility of reopening tin mines which have the necessary
infrastructure in place.
	   Menteri Besar Tan Sri Ramli Ngah Talib said in view of the
improved tin price which appeared to be maintaining its position,
such tin mines would prove to be viable and profitable.
	   Ramli said if operating costs of the mines could be reduced, the
viability of reactivating the mines would increase.
	   He added that new tin mines would not be considered and neither
would those which lacked proper infrastructure as these mines would
not be viable.
	   ``From being a major exporter of tin, Malaysia is now a net
importer to the tune of some RM80 million annually. The aim of
reopening the mines is to find ways to reduce the country's import
bill,'' he said after chairing the State Executive Council meeting
today.
	   Malaysia uses 7,000 tonnes of tin annually of which only 5,000
tonnes are mined locally.
	   Ramli said discussions would be held with the Land and Mines
Department to identify tin mines which can be reopened.
	   Perak currently has only 18 tin mines which are active in
comparison with 543 mines which were producing the ore in 1976.
	   Late last month, Kuala Lumpur Tin Market chairman Datuk Mohd
Ajib Anuar was reported to have said that the Malaysian Chamber of
Mines planned to submit a memorandum with appropriate
recommendations for the revival of the tin industry to the Primary
Industries Ministry as well as to the Selangor and Perak State
Governments.
	   This move was lauded by the All Malaya Chinese Mining
Association which said the reopening of tin mines would also
provide jobs especially for those who have been retrenched as a
result of the current economic problems.
	   For the first time since the late 1980's the Perak Government
collected RM253,799.89 in royalties from tin for the eight months
between October last year and April this year.
	   Royalties are only collected when the price of tin is above RM20
per kilo.

	   DESPITE the economic downwturn food and beverage manufacturer
Yeo Hiap Seng (Malaysia) Bhd managed to increase its share in the
non-carbonated soft drinks market to 60 per cent for the year ended
Dec 31, 1997.
	   Previously, the market share was 54 per cent.
	   The non-carbonated soft drink market in Malaysia consists of 149
million litres. It is 35 per cent of the total soft drink market of
437 million litres.
	   Yeo Hiap Seng financial director Chew Eng Chan yesterday said
this year the company intends to sustain its share in the
non-carbonated soft drink market.
	   ``For the first quarter of this year, we have performed
satisfactorily in terms of sales,'' he said.
	   The company also claims to be the country's leader in the
locally canned food market in terms of volume and range of
products.
	   Apart from manufacturing food and beverage under the brand name
Yeo's, Yeo Hiap Seng also distributes food and beverage items of
others.
	   Recently, the company was appointed as the sole distributor of
the Pagoda brand groundnuts.
	   Speaking at Yeo Hiap Seng's annual general meeting in Petaling
Jaya, chairman Datuk Borhan Kuntom said the company's operating
costs had increased between 50 and 70 per cent due to the weakening
ringgit.
	   ``We have to import some raw materials such as soft drink
concentrates and milk powder. Some of the raw material prices have
increased in tandem with the weakening ringgit.
	   ``In addition, it is difficult to source our raw materials such
as milk powder locally. At present, we import milk powder from
Australia and New Zealand.''
	   He added that the company would ``go all out'' to discover ways
to localise products through research and development.
	   On Yeo Hiap Seng's food and beverage products, he said the
company would increase the retail price for the products only if
other players increased the prices of their products.
	   ``To date, to maintain our competitiveness, we have absorbed
most of the increased production costs.
	   ``In future, any price increase for our products will depend on
the Food and Beverage Association. If the association members agree
to increase prices of products than we will also increase the
prices.''
	   Yeo Hiap Seng's group pre-tax profit declined 12.9 per cent to
RM30.15 million for the year ended Dec 31, 1997, from RM34.61
million previously.
	   Its turnover increased 4.5 per cent to RM493.25 million from
RM471.85 million in 1996.

Polgar leads 4-2 after third day of play against Karpov
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) - Hungary's Judit Polgar, the world's top
woman chess player, took a significant 4-2 lead Thursday, after the
third day of play against reigning world chess champion Anatoly
Karpov.
	   ``I'm very glad to be two `goals' ahead, to use soccer
terminology, given it's World Cup time,'' a tired, but smiling
Polgar, 21, told reporters.
	   Karpov, 47, who was already a grand master when Judit was not
even born, left the room immediately after the game, the second tie
of the day.
	   The first game ended in a stalemate after 75 moves, the last
move was made by Karpov.
	   The second ended after 49 moves and was also a tie. A win earns
one point, a tie a half point.
	   ``Karpov has found his pace,'' Polgar said, ``and played a
faster game today. On Friday, I will have to be careful not to get
over-confident.''
	   This was the third day of a four-day, eight-game speed match
competition in which players have 30 minutes each, and the first
time in chess history that the top male and female chess players
play against each other.

	   INTERNATIONAL Business Machines Corp is focusing its efforts on
empowering Asia-Pacific broadcasters with the infrastructure and
tools critical for exploiting the industry's transition from
analogue to digital technologies.
	   According to IBM's Global Telecommunications and Media
Industries vice president for broadcasting, cable and sports
William Moses, the media and entertainment industries are among the
most dynamic and technologically- driven markets, especially in
emerging economies such as Asia.
	   These, he said, provide IBM with extraordinary growth
opportunities.
	   It is estimated that US$1 trillion (about RM4 trillion) is spent
globally on telecommunications and media services and products.
	   ``Accelerating the trend towards digitisation is the emergence
of network computing and the explosion of the Internet that is
creating powerful shifts in technology selection and use,'' said
Moses.
	   He said in order to take advantage of the potential of network
computing, it is rapidly becoming apparent that companies,
especially larger enterprises, should form partnerships with
technology providers.
	   While the drive to digital is inevitable, IBM believes that the
migration will be evolutionary rather then revolutionary with
analogue and digital co-existing into the next millennium.
	   ``Broadcasters in Asia-Pacific need to prepare now by investing
in a digital infrastructure that opens a whole new world of
managing their valuable assets, from generating new programmes to
transporting content,''
	   Moses told a regional Press conference which was held in
Singapore last week in conjunction with Broadcast Asia '98
exhibition.
	   ``While IBM is not in the broadcasting business, we are a leader
in the technology that is driving that industry. Not only do we
understand the technology, we also have the global reach and
expertise.''
	   Moses said as a solutions provider, IBM has the capabilities to
provide these companies with solutions that incorporate
leading-edge technology to enable them to reduce costs, and extend
their brand and share in their go- to-market risk.
	   IBM provides industry-specific solutions and services to these
companies that will accelerate process transformation, achieve
effective cost reduction and establish new markets.
	   Among the solutions offered are news archive application, video
page editor, information navigation system, sports solutions,
digital library Avid connection, content distribution and spot
insertion solution and logicast intranet broadcasting.
	   Also in the offing is a digital and media asset management - the
acquisition, management, modification and distribution of content.
	   Media asset management includes the enabling of digital
infrastructure, the assets of underlying business processes that
manage rights, financial, royalties, location and availability of
assets. It also includes the ability to store, capture, create,
retrieve, process, manipulate, market and distribute content.

	   THE Government has set up a cross-agency body called the
National E- Commerce Committee (NEEC) to develop a framework which
will define the country's strategic positioning in the realm of
electronic commerce (e- commerce).
	   Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad is expected to
unveil the framework at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operations
summit, scheduled to be held in Kuala Lumpur in November this year.
	   The framework will include Malaysia's strategic positioning and
leadership with regards to cross-border e-commerce activities such
as between countries in the Asean region.
	   According to Multimedia Development Corporation's (MDC) senior
manager of borderless marketing Dr Han Chun Kwong, the framework
will also define the Government's role in supporting and providing
the jump-start processes and implementation of mechanisms for
e-commerce. ``It will also define the industry's role, and identify
industry segmentation, and product or market niches in
e-commerce,'' Han told Computimes on Monday.
	   The committee, which has started work, is chaired by Chief
Secretary to the Government Tan Sri Abdul Halim Ali, and operates
with two sub- committees. One of them is chaired by the Energy,
Telecommunications and Posts Ministry and handles the electronic
infrastructure for enabling e- commerce, while the other is headed
by the International Trade and Industry and looks into e-commerce
trade issues. MDC serves as the secretariat for the NEEC.
	   According to Han, the framework is expected to set performance
indicators, critical success factors and monitoring mechanisms for
e- commerce at the corporate, industry and macro-economic levels,
as well as mechanisms to track e-commerce transactions which take
place in the country, for macro-planning purposes.
	   In addition, the framework will cover issues crucial to develop
a conducive environment for e-commerce, he added.
	   The issues will form the country's guiding principles in the
areas of Customs, Internet taxes, payment systems, intellectual
property protection, privacy, security, telecommunications
infrastructure, content industry development, and technical
standards for inter-operability.
	   ``Also covered in the framework are related issues such as
policy implementation, review and feedback processes for the
implementation of e- commerce in the country,'' said Han.
	   He added that MDC is currently conducting a study through a fund
of RM1.5 million provided by the Economic Planning Unit of the
Prime Minister's Department.
	   The study covers issues such as the awareness of e-commerce, the
extent of its usage and the readiness of companies to go into
e-commerce in the country.
	   Findings of the study will provide crucial inputs in the
development of the e-commerce framework by the NEEC, Han said.
	   The committee's strategic goal ultimately is to ensure the
creation of a conducive environment for e-commerce to flourish in
the country. E- commerce is a key component of borderless
marketing, one of the seven flagship applications of the Multimedia
Super Corridor (MSC).
	   Among the specific e-commerce projects identified for the MSC
are electronic government, via the electronic procurement system,
the multi- purpose card, electronic catalogue,
entertainment-on-demand, as well as education-on-demand. In order
to jump-start the implementation of e- commerce, MDC will be
organising a series of promotions which include briefings to
industry assocations, key executives and top management on the
topic. To date, 31 MSC-status companies have identified e-commerce
as their core businesses.
	   Among them, 12 companies are in content development, six in
network distribution, five in software development, another five in
finance, two in smartcards, and another in virtual community.
	   It is estimated that within the first five years of operations,
these companies would need some 19,000 knowledge workers to carry
out their e- commerce activities. E-commerce operates across the
computer networks from the advertising process to ordering, payment
and customer support.

U.N. refugee chief calls for end to Kosovo violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United Nations refugee chief issued an appeal
Thursday to all sides immediately to put ``an end to the cycle of
violence'' in the explosive Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
	   Further displacement of refugees ``could destabilize the entire
region,'' U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata said in
a statement.
	   UNHCR estimates that some 12,000 refugees have already fled
across mountains from Kosovo into northern Albania to escape the
latest outbreak of fighting.
	   Altogether, ``around 65,000 people have been forced to flee
their homes in Kosovo'' since March, Ogata said.
	   Some 8,000 have fled to the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro and
others, estimated at 45,000, have fled to other parts of Kosovo.
	   ``Nobody wants another Bosnia,'' Ogata added. UNHCR is still
working to ``solve the situation'' of some 1.8 million people
displaced from the Bosnian and Croatian conflicts.
	   Ogata said she is ``worried about some 13,000 refugees, mainly
Serbs from Croatia, staying in Kosovo, some of whom have had to
flee once again.''
	   She appealed for international support of Albania's efforts to
deal with the influx of refugees.
	   Also Thursday, the international Red Cross launched an appeal
for 3.2 million Swiss francs (dlrs 2.2 million) in aid for the
refugees in northern Albania.
	   The sum is intended to meet their food needs for four months,
and to provide hygiene parcels, blankets and mattresses, baby food
and clothes, a statement said.

	   PETALING JAYA, Wed. - A woman told the Sessions Court today that
the security manager of her husband's company informed him that he
had lost the RM1 million that was meant to pay off trade debts.
	   Ng Yuet Ho, 45, said the security manager, Ali Akarbara
Mangudin, then said that he wanted to leave the company and be on
his own.
	   She said Ali also informed her husband, Tan Hoe Kock, that his
(Ali's) friend, Ah Seng, was the person who had paid the balance of
the RM1 million owed by one of Tan's subsidiary companies to two
fabric suppliers, Tat Fong Hup Kee and Hiap Joo Textiles.
	   She said Ali also told her husband that Ah Seng had taken
control of all the companies belonging to them (Ng and Tan).
	   ``He told my husband that he wanted another RM300,000 and if we
failed to give him the money within 60 days, his friends would
torture us.''
	   Ng was giving evidence at the trial of Ali, 49, who is charged
with cheating; and two company directors, Chuah Hock Siang, 50, and
Ho Tak Tzann, 37, charged with abetting Ali to cheat Tan and her of
RM10.4 million.
	   Ali is alleged to have cheated Tan and Ng of 100,000 PN
Consolidated shares worth RM100,000 and 270,000 Metroknit Sdn Bhd
shares worth RM270,000 by transferring the shares to Sidah Akbar
Sdn Bhd at PN Consolidated's office in Damansara Jaya at 8.30am on
Feb 17 last year.
	   Ali also faces a second charge of cheating Tan, then a director
of PN Consolidated, of RM1 million cash by deceiving him into
believing that the money would be used to settle a RM2 million debt
incurred by Weatherwell Corporation Sdn Bhd (a subsidiary of PN
Consolidated), but instead diverted the money to Sidah Akbar.
	   Hearing continues.

ETA's longest hostage was rescued four days before he planned to

kill himself &QL; 
 &UR; By MAR ROMAN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A former prison officer held hostage for 18
months by the Basque separatist group ETA, testified Thursday that
he was planning suicide when he was rescued.
	   In a written statement read during the second and last day of
the National Court trial for ETA's longest kidnapping, Jose Antonio
Ortega Lara said he had given up hope and decided to hang himself
or cut his wrists on July 5 last year.
	   But with four days to go before his personal deadline, the
39-year-old prison officer was rescued from the 3-meter by
2.5-meter (9-foot by 7-foot) windowless room where he had been
hidden throughout his captivity.
	   The ETA kidnapped Ortega Lara on January 7 1996, conditioning
his release on improved conditions for 450 jailed members of the
group. A year and a half later police tracked down his four captors
and discovered the hideout located in the northern city of
Mondragon.
	   On the opening day of the trial the four defendants admitted to
keeping Ortega Lara hostage but denied conspiring to murder him.
They could face up to 32 years in prison if convicted on both
counts.
	   Since beginning its campaign for an independent Basque state in
1968, the ETA has kidnapped 71 people, most of them Basque
businessmen, to raise funds for its operations.

	   A SURFBOARD hangs from the ceiling of my university office. No.
That was not intended to be a deep and philosophical metaphor for
something else - I actually have an eight-foot fibreglass surfboard
with three fins and a leash attachment suspended from my ceiling.
It is not immediately ``in the face'' of those with the temerity to
visit me in my lair, hanging as it does a bare foot below the
nondescript off-white panels and somewhat fading into the
background, being white itself. However, after taking a seat,
students with an inquisitive eye notice its elegant lines and
curvaceous form suspended, apparently from nothing at all.
	   You may ask, ``What is a surfboard doing hanging from nothing in
the roof of your office?'' That would be a refreshing surprise -
because students do not ask. They sit; they exclaim in amazement
upon first noticing it; but only one non-debater has ever made a
comment. She remarked, ``Oh. That's nice.'' and went on to discuss
her thesis.
	   The answer, however, is that I spent a lot of money to buy it;
it is one of the last in a series of boards by a retiring master of
the art. Leaving it at home, lying atop a wardrobe in its
protective cover, seemed a waste of something that gives me much
aesthetic pleasure. Hanging like a Board of Damocles over my head
(you are correct. It should have been ``sword'', but I was born
taking liberties with language!), it is in precisely the right
position for me to dwell upon its beauty when I lean back in my
chair, searching out that elusive idea or recoiling in horror from
my marking responsibilities.
	   However, I slide from the point (again). People often remark -
particularly those who fancy themselves psychologists or
counsellors - that Asians generally have problems with conflict;
they do everything they can to avoid drawing attention to things
hanging in odd places. The claim is this element of the Asian mind
comes from our traditional ways of relating to each other, our
marriage customs and eating too much steroid- injected meat and
hormone-stuffed chic-ken.
	   In debating terms, this is supposed to be a problem that
confronts coaches and trainers sooner rather than later; an
inability in our student debaters to become aggressive in their
speaking style when occasion demands. On the other hand, if we find
a certain streak of contrariness in someone and develop that skill
until it becomes useful - we are accused by our peers of producing
little monsters: People doomed to be social misfits, cynics and
unable to form lasting relationships (because they'll argue a
potential mate into the ground - or be unhappy with a spouse who
always agrees with them!).
	   I look at the situation differently. On one hand are the
increasingly harsh demands of a global communication system that
requires of the oppressed minority, the cultural clone and the
socially inept individual that they shout until they are heard or
fade into obscurity. On the other hand, we have individuals in our
schools who have not had their passions suppressed or denied, but
who have found neither the ``voice'' nor the ``format'' with which
to express that passion. Finally, on a third and Frankensteinian
hand, we have young people with the same concerns as their
counterparts in the rest of the world - but with a decided
advantage: A culture and tradition that gives them both a unique
perspectuve and a solid foundation upon which to base their
emerging worldview.
	   I dispute the assertion that successful debate trainers and
coaches encourage their debaters into patterns of speech and
behaviour that are unnatural and unbecoming to a Malaysian, for two
reasons. First, these are not unnatural; any psychologist will tell
you no human being can adopt behaviour patterns contrary to their
own instincts or beliefs and hope to maintain the camouflage with
any degree of sincerity for even the shortest time. Second, the
debater with a natural talent for passionate speaking and who has
been properly trained to use it, will resort to aggression only in
answer to aggression.
	   Yet an ability to speak passionately when required is only one
of the strategies a debater should be able to call upon. Speaking
order is the first thing a trainer should consider.
	   Personally, I have always believed third speakers are born and
not made.
	   For me, this is the one position that, once established, does
not change in the team set-up. The qualities of a good third
speaker are: An ability to observe and analyse the arguments of the
other team; an ability to rapidly grasp the relative merits of both
cases; an ability to attack the weaknesses in the case on the
opposite bench, while rebutting key issues by extending the
arguments already presented by your own.
	   These skils are markedly different from those of the first two
speakers, something which would normally preclude an easy exchange
of roles. By all means train your third speakers for other roles,
to facilitate in them an understanding of the demands made upon
speakers in those positions, but ``once a third speaker, always a
third speaker'', particularly when the competition itself draws
nigh.
	   On the other hand (hey, these hands are getting scattered about
as though a bunch of careless zombies were waving on the terraces
in Paris!), first and second speakers may often practise switching
roles, specificallty when the team position changes from
``affirming'' to ``negating''. Obviously, when a team is affirming,
the demands made upon the first speaker are different from those
made upon either the first negative or the seconds on either side.
Even if the style is a more interactive, ``parliamentary'' one, the
number and quality of attacks made upon speakers in the role of
Prime Minister is lower than those on successive speakers.
	   Consequently, you need an opening speaker who can give a nice,
clear, logical set-up to the debate. Someone who feels happiest
working with good notes and sounds perennially sincere functions
best in this role.
	   On the other hand (these zombies on the terraces will have to
start stamping their feet soon, because they can't have many hands
left!), the first negative speaker may often be called upon to
present a case and her own first speech in the length of time it
takes the PM to open the debate.
	   This, when the negative team assumed the definition would set up
the debate one way, but it is set up in a way that renders the
negative team's argument useless. In such cases, you need a speaker
who can respond quickly to new demands, give the second speaker
something he can prepare for, then launch into an impromptu speech.
	   We shall take a break from debating for a while and concentrate
next week on classroom decoration. It may, then, be a good idea to
hold off throwing away those old paint tins, in case they come in
handy.

 &UR; Ancient hominid brain may have been smaller than once believed &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Early human-like creatures who lived more than
2 million years ago had smaller brains than once believed, suggest
researchers, who used a modern medical tool to analyze fossilized
skulls.
	   Glenn C. Conroy of Washington University in St. Louis reported
that his analysis of the skulls from the early ancestors of modern
humans suggests that ``something is very wrong with previous
interpretations of early hominid brain capacity.''
	   Conroy is the lead author of a study appearing Friday in the
journal Science.
	   The finding ``is about to wreck havoc on our view of hominid
evolution,'' said Dean Falk, an anthropologist at State University
of New York, Albany. Conroy's work may force a reworking of
theories about the timing of brain development among the early
ancestors of modern human beings, Falk said.
	   ``The ramifications for hominid brain evolution may be
profound,'' Falk wrote in a commentary in Science.
	   Conroy is co-developer of a way to analyze fossilized skulls
using computed tomography, or CT, scans. The system lets
researchers see inside skull fossils and reconstruct the skull from
fragments, allowing a precise measure of brain size.
	   Using the technique, Conroy analyzed the skull of ``Mr. Ples'',
the name given for the fossil of an Australopithecus africanus, a
hominid that lived in what is now South Africa. A. africanus are
thought to be early ancestors of modern humans that lived in Africa
3.5 million to 2.5 million years ago.
	   Conroy found the skull had the brain capacity of about 515 cubic
centimeters.
	   Earlier estimates of the skull had put the brain size at about
600 cc, far larger than the mid-400 cc range thought to be typical
for A. africanus brains.
	   Falk said the brain size is larger than average for hominids
from that era, but far smaller than what experts had predicted for
the skull. Modern humans have a brain size of about 1,350 cc.
	   Conroy also analyzed another A. africanus skull and found it was
370 cc, not the 440 cc that had previously been assigned to the
fossil.
	   ``I was shocked,'' Conroy said in a statement. ``There was
supposed to be a quantitative leap in brain size that distinguished
early hominids from apes, yet 370 cc is the size of a chimpanzee
brain.''
	   Conroy said his findings suggest the brain sizes estimated for
other early hominid skulls may be wrong, that ``current views on
the tempo and mode of early hominid brain evolution may need
re-evaluation.''

	   EVEN for veterans of motoring treasure hunts, another hunt can
just be as exasperating as the first as competing teams anxiously
peer through their car windows, trundle along busy, dusty roads and
argue over answers to the riddles.
	   Nevertheless, they always have fun as scores of journalists
found out recently as they wound their way from the Kuala Lumpur
Golf and Country Club to Club Med Cherating, 321km away, in a Press
treasure hunt organised in conjunction with the World Cup '98.
	   An air of festivity pervaded at the gaily-decorated KLGCC car
park, venue of the flag-off that early morning. Enjoying an
open-air breakfast, each team was given a set of tulips (route)
together with a set of 30 questions as well as riddles for three
treasures to be handed later at the finishing point.
	   Our team got an EON-sponsored, gleaming tomato-red Proton
Perdana Executive. I noticed that some of the participants couldn't
wait to get started as they feverishly went through the questions
while waiting for the group photographs and the flag-off.
	   The questions and riddles involved a lot of play of words and
general knowledge, especially of - what else - soccer.
	   Some of us were either still sleepy or just forgetful and wasted
precious time looking for the answer to the first question way
before a petrol station in Karak, as tipped earlier by Y.S. Khong,
who set the questions.
	   The first question went like this: Manchester United's main
sponsor can be found in a reliable establishment here. As long as
you've been following English soccer, even if not a fan of MU, you
would know it's ``Sharp at Letrik Sound'' (a shop selling household
appliances).
	   Some questions and riddles were considered gifts like ``Present
business inspired by Ron Howard?'' (the answer was Pusat
Cenderahati Happy Day Gifts), ``Old Manchester United player can
make you look good here'' (Best Creation) after the legendary
George Best, and ``Our very own ex-goalkeeper in the fabric
business here?'' (Arumugam Textiles), after the late Selangor
goalkeeper R. Arumugam.
	   However, there were clues that were either ``hidden'' or too
small (like the shoplot number K-9 for the riddle, ``Dog's
address'') to be noticed from the roadside. Some of us just gave up
on certain questions as they took too much time to solve with many
still to go. We were racing against time while battling through
heavy traffic at some points with irritated motorists honking
behind us.
	   Some of the teams arrived at the finishing point at Club Med
Cherating well after the given time. But after the tiring and
patience-testing hunt, weren't we all glad to see the rustic charm
of Club Med and its cheerful genteel organisers.
	   Answers to the questions and riddles were disclosed by Khong
before the winning teams were announced and prizes - Sharp TV sets,
Nokia handphones and Arena cordless phones - were given away.
Enthusiastic applause and playful booing followed some of the
answers given.
	   Question 14 went like this: A period and a change of case in the
right places and this garden would honour one of our famous
pioneers in football.
	   However, the answer Taman Zabidin was mind-boggling to some of
us. Even if you're an ardent fan of Selangor sweeper Zainal Abidin
Hassan, would you regard him (with due respect to him) as a pioneer
in Malaysian soccer?
	   Oh, well...
	   Like a handphone battery, said Khong, the hunt started with high
enthusiasm but dissipated half-way as shown by the deteriorating
performance in the answer sheets.
	   Prior to a sumptuous buffet dinner, we witnessed a colourful Gay
Paree- style launching of Dunhill's sponsorship of the live
telecast of the 64 World Cup matches from France over RTM and TV3.
	   We spent the rest of the evening watching the GOs perform,
chatting with friends around the pool, dozing off on the deck
chairs, walking along the beach, or dancing into the early hours at
the disco.
	   After breakfast the next day, most of the Pressmen were divided
into teams - named after Romania, Germany, Spain, Italy, England,
Brazil, Argentina, France and Holland - for the Dunhill Treasure
Hunt 7-A-Side Soccer Challenge.
	   Supporters and hecklers seemed to be having more fun than the
players as many of the latter struggled with fitness, stamina and
lack of experience.
	   The spectators seemed to agree that Malay Mail sports writer
Fariq Rahman was better off on the disco floor than the soccer
field. ``Hoi Fariq, you think this is the disco floor ah? Engkau
menari disko lagi elok (you are better off disco dancing).'' But
Fariq, from team ``Romania'', managed to score a goal during a
semi-final clash. He was elated as he ran towards me, shouting:
``Kak Yani. I've been planning this since morning, but it's only at
three that I managed to do it!'' Surprise! Surprise! In the final,
``Spain'', comprising mostly older, overworked journalists who were
slower on the ball, defeated ``Romania'' 1-0 - definitely no
reflection on what's going to happen in the World Cup.
	   Those not playing soccer or cheering on the players tried their
hand at face-painting, archery, wall-climbing, swimming in the
club's pools, playing other games like shoot-the-ball, or just
relaxing at the beach nearby.
	   While having lunch, I watched the GOs and some club guests doing
the sun dance around the pool, a daily activity at the club. In
that searing heat, I thought they were crazy.
	   I noticed that Robin, the Japanese-Belgian hunk, was bare-topped
all the time. ``I think he likes to show off his body,'' I said to
the men at my table. ``With a body like that, I would also want to
show off,'' said a pot- bellied journalist as he tucked into the
calorie-loaded dessert.
	   There were more activities after the soccer challenge in the
evening.
	   Malaysian Business' Abdul Razak Chik tested his guts and agility
by climbing, swinging and jumping around on a contraption called
circus school. He was so delighted to have done it this time, his
second attempt in four years, that he kept planting kisses on the
certificate he received.
	   The next day was free and easy for us. While some chose to stay
till the afternoon to enjoy the facilities, others started off on a
leisurely drive back to KL.

New Swiss Guards commander to begin in August
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The new commander of the pope's Swiss
Guards said Thursday he will take up the post in early August.
	   Pius Segmueller, a 46-year-old Swiss army colonel, confirmed
that he will move to Rome after leaving his present job in July.
	   Pope John Paul II named Segmueller as commander last week, a
month after predecessor Alois Estermann was fatally shot along with
his wife, apparently by a disgruntled young guardsman.
	   Segmueller is currently with the Swiss army's Bern-based
Hospital Regiment 12. He said he would take a few days' vacation to
prepare for his new job.
	   The timing of his move means that former commander Roland Buchs,
who agreed to take charge while the Vatican found a replacement for
Estermann, will still be in charge when 40 new guardsmen are sworn
in on June 28.

	   DID you know that most of the carpets used in our hotels, in
many of the main mosques and even in palaces are manufactured by a
Malaysian company?
	   Believe it. They are products of Carpets International Malaysia
(CIM), the country's largest carpet designer, manufacturer and
distributor.
	   Over the years, CIM, which was established in 1965, has grown
locally and internationally. In Malaysia, it controls about 30 per
cent of the market. The company has developed a wide range of
carpets to meet the needs of an impressive variety of clients.
	   The list includes palaces, luxury hotels, exclusive clubs and
commercial buildings, motor manufacturers, corporations and
government agencies.
	   CIM also boasts pioneering techniques and has its own in-house
design studio and a dye house.
	   These features offer customers unrivalled flexibility in the
commission and execution of designs and colour versatility.
	   In terms of weaving techniques, CIM offers a choice of five
different manufacturing processes - hand tuft, Axminster (woven),
machine tuft, needle punch and auto.
	   In the case of Axminster carpets which are the most popular type
for hotels, clubs, palaces and commercial buildings, CIM's only
competitors are foreign manufacturers.
	   Manufacturing facilities are housed in CIM's factory in Jalan
Kuchai Lama, Kuala Lumpur. The carpets are marketed under brand

	   PRACHAKORN Thai dissidents petitioned the Election Commission
yesterday to prevent their dismissal from the party's executive
board, which is set to expel them.
	   Prachakorn Thai MP Thanusak Lekuthai of Uttaradit said the
party's executive board meeting on Monday violated party
regulations, the political party law and the Constitution.
	   The party's Regulation 43 stipulates that punishing any party
member needs the consent of at least 20 party members. The meeting
on Monday, however, was based on only Sanit Srisamdaeng's proposal.
	   Monday's meeting also violated the party's Regulation 45 which
states that accused members must be given the chance to prove their
innocence.
	   Thanusak said he submitted a recording of the meeting to prove
that the party leader and executive board violated party
regulations and to show that the meeting did not comprise 40 to 50
members as claimed by some party members.
	   Thanusak ruled out seeking emergency protection from the Civil
Court, saying that would be unnecessary since he believed the
Election Commission would take the group's complaint into
consideration.
	   Wisuth Pothan, a member of the Election Commission, said the
commission would investigate whether Thanusak, who is merely a
party member, has the right to lodge a petition. The political
party law states that a party registrar or representative are
entitled to submit a petition.
	   The commission will also summon the concerned parties to testify
before making ruling.

	   YES, it's true what the other bitches say about me. I do prefer
humans to my kind... even though the humans have treated me rather
shabbily.
	   You see, after giving my former owners six lovely puppies, they
decided to keep only my two boys and send the rest of us away. But
they were ``kind'' enough to pay for my spay, so what can I say...
hurray?
	   Anyway, I'm three years old and they do say I'm loving and
smart, and will make an excellent pet.
	   So call me at the SPCA, 03-4565312. Ask for Ginger. That's me.

	   Government spokesman Akhapol Sorasuchart take note: the
government campaign to discourage people from buying and drinking
imported wine has apparently fallen on deaf ears -- if the surge in
sales of the produce can be of an indicator.
	   Visuth Pongviratchai, deputy managing director of Berli Jucker
Plc, proudly said that compared with last year the wine sales have
increased by 18 per cent over the first five months of this year.
	   ''The growth is beyond our expectations. Actually the sale
volume is about 45 per cent more than we initially expected,'' he
said.
	   Visuth says the company has set to earn Bt160 million from
selling the wine this year.
	   While many groups are campaigning for austerity and conservation
of energy by coaxing people to buy environmentally-friendly
products, well-known singer and songwriter Su Boonliang thinks
otherwise.
	   ''We should look from our inner self. I think we should start
with conserving our own feelings. If we could do that, we would not
long for something extravagant or unnecessary,'' he said.
	   Su said many groups who proclaimed themselves as
environmentalists often came to him to sell their products like pa
khao ma and cotton fabric. But he always refused to buy.
	   ''When I said no, they were mad at me. They said I wasn't a true
environmentalist. But I told them why I had to buy the products. I
already have what they were trying to sell to me. Why should I have
more?'' he said.
	   Parliament President and New Aspiration Party deputy leader Wan
Mohammad Noor Matha is regarded as a respected politician who
hardly relies on recrimination against his opponents.
	   In a recent campaign in the South, however, he unexpectedly lost
his control. His target is no one else but the Democrat Party --
the NAP's arch enemy.
	   Ironically, however, his harsh comments against the Democrats
over vote-buying also forced him to confess that the NAP also
resorted to such a dirty tactic.
	   ''I am not brazen enough to deny that there is no single NAP MP
who didn't buy votes. ... There are such cases in our party,
however, the Democrats blatantly said that they didn't do this even
though there is a tape-cassette to prove the incident,'' he said.
	   Kraisak Chonhavan, normally prefers to remain low-profile, but
each time he broke his silence, every one listened.
	   In his obituary to his father, the late former prime minister
Gen Chatichai Choonhavan, Kraisak caught the attention of readers
with shocking details about Chatichai's operation at Cromwell
Hospital in London.
	   ''It was commotion as I saw doctors and nurses scurrying inside
the room. Some of them managed to close a curtain. It prompted me
to think something might have gone wrong with my father.
	   ''Once I was allowed to enter the room, I saw a pool of blood
oozing from his neck [on which Chatichai earlier had a
tracheotomy]. At first, I didn't know what had happened. But
doctors told me later that there was a mistake during an operation
-- a needle used to puncture his liver mistakenly pierced his lung.
His vital organs subsequently stop functioning,'' he wrote.
	   Earlier Kraisak regretted that his father had not been
hospitalised in Thailand. He also said that he agreed with Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai, who asked him why Chatichai did not seek
medical treatment inside the country.

	   WHETHER it's tiredness or the stress of the new job, Masoumeh
Ebtekar has dark rings around her eyes. Her gaze is evasive, so
it's a pleasant surprise when all of a sudden her face breaks into
a radiant smile underneath her veil.
	   Since May last year, this 38-year-old immunologist has served as
Vice- President, the first woman to hold this job in the Islamic
Republic founded by Ayatollah Khomeini.
	   This formidable woman is now one of seven deputies to moderate
President Mohamad Khatami, elected by a landslide in the spring of
1997. But this is by no means Ebtekar's first important role.
	   In 1979, she was the spokesperson for students who held American
embassy workers hostage for 400 days during the revolution. She
then became editor of the woman's magazine Farzaneh.
	   In 1995, she was president of the Iranian delegation to the
Beijing conference on women's rights sponsored by the United
Nations.
	   Following are excerpts from the interview.
	   Q: Did you expect Khatami to offer you the job?
	   A: I would never have imagined it. It had never occurred to me
to take on such a responsibility. It was a total surprise, but I
did know it was an ideal moment for a woman to step into a
decision-making role on the Iranian political scene. Attitudes were
right. Since the Islamic Revolution, Iranian women have
demonstrated their ability, and today we're seeing well-educated
women take on very important positions.
	   Women have a better deal nowadays with regards to their health,
their education, family planning and participation in politics.
	   Q: Could you give some concrete examples of this positive trend
for women in Iran?
	   A: If we look at the data from the most recent census, we can
see that the rate of literacy among women has risen considerably
and now reaches about 80 per cent, whereas before the Islamic
Revolution it was around 56 per cent.
	   Women have made far quicker progress than men here. And if you
take the example of the Faculty of Medicine I attended, women make
up more than 47 per cent of students and 30 per cent of teaching
staff there.
	   Q: So the fact that there are only two women in Khatami's
Cabinet, you as Vice-President and Zahra Shojoi as advisor in
women's issues, puts the government way behind in terms of
opportunities given to women?
	   A: It's only the beginning. It's a first step, but a very
important one.
	   Shojoi has the opportunity to have a direct influence on all the
issues affecting women in society, and can check that the decisions
made in the Cabinet have positive effects on women's lives. It's
very important because at the top decision-making level, there were
no precedents of women having an influence. Now there are two of
us.
	   Q.: Why is it that Azam Taleghani failed in her bid for the
presidency last year?
	   A: There's no official policy line on what should be done when
and if a woman runs for the presidency. In general, the Council of
Guardians (the institution which determines state policy) has its
own criteria. However, some observers and Islamic academicians say
there is an ambiguity in the Constitution, in the use of one word
in particular, Rejal, that describes who can serve as President.
This word can mean ``personality'' but also ``man''. The issue
still isn't resolved.
	   Q: When President Khatami was elected in 1997, a surprise
victory over a conservative candidate, young people and women in
particular were celebrating in the streets. What do you think their
hopes and expectations were?
	   A: First of all, it was their natural feelings of hope and
enthusiasm.
	   Nineteen years after the revolution, Iranians had voted a figure
from the revolution into power - Khatami, who is aware of the needs
of our time and of changes in society. People expect solutions to
be found to the country's economic problems, the younger
generations need to be included too and they need to feel that
their voices are being heard.
	   Q: Do you approve of the fact that an Iranian woman has to ask
her husband's permission to leave the country?
	   A: In Islam, we consider marriage to be a contract between a man
and a woman, a very serious contract, which doesn't just determine
the future of that man and that woman, but also of other
individuals: their children.
	   According to this contract, the man is economically and legally
responsible for his family. The woman is free to pursue her own
economic activities if she wants. But she accepts other
responsibilities. She has to ask her husband's permission to leave
the country. It means that when one of the contracting parties
accepts being economically responsible, it's only right that he is
informed of what is going on in his family.
	   It's natural that, in accepting this contract, we accept the
limitation of our freedom. We're convinced that the family is
fundamentally for the intellectual, moral and spritual development
of our children and ourselves.

	   THE New Aspiration Party yesterday retaliated against the
Democrats by having the secretary to the Parliament president send
a letter to a PM's deputy secretary-general over the protracted war
of words related to vote-buying allegations.
	   Burachanudin Useng, secretary to Parliament President Wan
Mohammad Noor Matha, sent a letter to PM's deputy secretary-general
Nipon Boonyapattharo in retaliation to Nipon's earlier letter to
the Parliament president.
	   In his letter, Burachanudin said he needed to take action
because Wan Noor, who is an NAP deputy leader, would not lower his
prestige to fight with a low-ranking official like Nipon.
	   Earlier, Nipon had sent a letter lambasting Wan Noor for having
criticised Prime Minister and Democrat leader Chuan Leekpai.
	   Burachanudin also attached a report from PollWatch, which showed
that the Democrat candidates were second among all parties against
whom complaints were launched in the July 2, 1995, elections.
	   The controversy stemmed from Chuan's comment last week that
though the NAP could go to campaign for political support in the
South, which is considered a Democrat stronghold, it should not
taint the region with vote-buying.
	   Wan Noor, who is the NAP's strongman in the South and controls
four other southern MPs, cried foul over Chuan's comment and
attacked the Democrats, saying the party, too, practised
vote-buying.
	   Nipon then sent an open letter to Wan Noor attacking the
Parliament president, saying Chuan was only making a general
comment.
	   Burachunin said in his letter that Wan Noor made his comments
during an internal party seminar, unlike Chuan who spoke to
reporters.
	   Burachunin said Nipon should ask Chuan why the prime minister
liked to satirise against other parties with his vote-buying
comments.
	   Meanwhile, Democrat secretary-general Sanan Kachornprasart said
Wan Noor should step down as Parliament president for having made
''groundless'' charges against the Democrats.

	   THE ideal mosque is one that nestles in a spacious garden with
shady trees and shrubs of scented flowers, and a water fountain
resting on a large pool of water to cool the surrounding area.
	   The cluster of buildings in the annexe is made up of the Imam's
residence, the muezzin's and other staff members involved in
managing and maintaining the mosque. To facilitate the needs of the
neighbourhood, a madrasah and a community library will cater for
its education and knowledge, and the community hall for all other
activities.
	   The mosque, says Sheikh Abdul Aziz Kamel, an eminent architect
from Jeddah, plays an important role in instilling religious values
in children. Under its roof, children grow up to become normal
adults, far from being the extremists that the foreign Press
propagates.
	   The mosque, as was intended, is not only a place for prayers but
also for charity and good deeds. It is a fertile ground for healthy
intellectual and socio-cultural development of the community,
attracting the participation of able and willing volunteers,
especially the youth. It is the best conduit for exchanges where
everybody benefits - ``No man is superior unto another except in
piety and good deeds.'' - Quran.
	   It is with respect to the concept of unity that the traditional
Muslim towns were designed. All the architectural designs are based
on the concept harmonising man with the environment.
	   Artists and craftsmen as well as traders conform to the concept
of harmony. The artists and craftsmen help to create the
environment that comforts the soul whereas the traders will fill up
every little niche of space to serve the needs of the society. They
are an important element in the expression of an Islamic way of
life. A visitor can feel safe in this environment where people are
God-fearing and they are generous and honest.
	   Their idea of business is ``give a little more and take a little
less.
	   After all, it is not going to hurt me.''
	   Whatever they do it is only to seek Allah's pleasure. In this
atmosphere of busy human activities with its symphony of sights,
sound and colours - not to mention the rich fusion of smells from
attar to food and spices - one can't help but feel elated.
	   The traders selling attar will invariably be closest to the
mosque so that the whiff of its refreshing aroma mingling with the
scent from the flowers in the garden will give off an invigorating
and therapeutic effect on the people entering the mosque. This
calming effect helps remove the stresses of the day's activities.
	   Kamel peppered his talk with words like ``balance'' and
``harmony''.
	   He says that although he considers himself a designer of space,
he also takes into consideration man's relationship with his
neighbour and the environment. It must all be in harmony, for this
is what makes life fulfilling and satisfying.
	   Kamel, who is in his 40s, may appear stern at first glance, but
quickly puts people at ease with his disarming smile and gentle
voice. He is committed to the cause of uplifting the status of
Muslim artists and craftsmen, for he believes they have long been
neglected.
	   Kamel qualified as an architect and engineer from Riyadh
University after which he joined his family's bank where he
eventually headed the real estate and investment division. His
architectural training came in useful when he had to deal with
building projects. During his time with Dallal Barakah Bank, he
realised that there was not one single architect who could come up
with a truly Islamic design. This prompted Kamel to plunge into
full-time architecture.
	   Kamel is reputedly the only architect in the world whose company
has embarked on reviving and developing the traditional Muslim arts
and architecture by employing over 300 skilled Muslim artists and
craftsmen working hand in hand with over 40 full-time architects.
	   The company has reintroduced the most beautiful elements of the
finest Muslim traditions in buildings, in interior decorations and
in furniture.
	   Kamel travels widely and he is regularly invited to give talks
on Islamic architecture from universities and organisations all
over the world. Not long ago he took part in various seminars in
Kuala Lumpur after his lecture at Oxford University. He established
extensive connection with architects all over the world to
continually exchange information on Muslim arts and architecture.

	   THE muscles in your thighs, legs and feet act as pumps for your
veins and move blood upwards. Your veins have valves which cause
blood to flow towards your heart but not in the reverse direction.
	   Consequently, any pressure exerted by your surrounding muscles
causes blood to flow upwards. The frog posture helps improve muscle
efficiency and tone, ensuring that the pumping action of muscles is
at its optimum.
	   By improving the blood flow, we are able to release tension in
our muscles. It is worth the effort practising the frog posture
especially if you have to stand for long periods.
	   The frog posture is done in a sitting position. The knees are
placed wide apart and the tips of the big toes touch. The buttocks
are placed on the floor between the feet. The wider you spread your
thighs, the easier it will be to sit on the floor as in Figure 1.
Keep the back straight and breathe normally for two to three
minutes. If there is any discomfort in the legs or hips, come out
of the posture and repeat it after a short break.
	   The frog posture helps to elongate the thigh muscles and improve
the blood circulation to the stomach and this, in turn, helps
digestion.
	   Practice the frog posture if you suffer from leg cramps or any
problems related to poor blood circulation in the legs.

	   RAYONG -- Doctors and nurses from a petrol refining company
provided medical checks on teachers and students at a nearby school
suffering from throat, skin and eye complaints as a result of toxic
gases being emitted by a gas company.
	   Two Mab Ta Put Pan Withaya School students were rushed to
hospital after exposure to perlite emissions from the Bangkok
Industrial Gases Co in Muang Rayong district. A school
administrator complained of the growing number of teachers at the
school seeking transfers on grounds of the hazards to their health.
	   Most of the student complaints involved rashes and sore eyes for
which they were given carlamine and bedrest in the school's first
aid room. Others were given a solution to wash their eyes. Still
others vomited and complained of shortness of breath and were
rushed to Ban Chang hospital. A number of teachers were suffering
from eye and throat pain, doctors said.
	   While treating the patients, doctors and nurses were able to
smell the gases intermittently.
	   Admitted to Bamrung-rat Hospital was eighth-grade student Apinya
Wongseesai, whose immune deficiency complaint was exacerbated after
exposure to the emissions. Seventh-grader Rewat Sookcharoen was
admitted to Ban Chang hospital after complaining of continuous
vomiting.
	   Mab Ta Put Pan Pithaya school director Winit Prathanrat said
yesterday he received a new spate of applications for transfer, on
top of three already approved.
	   Meanwhile, Wachira Nimwatanakul, the provincial health and
environmental health officer, installed equipment at the school to
collect particles of less than 10 microns to determine if pollution
levels exceed acceptable levels. Bangkok Industrial Gases assistant
managing director Chalee Hancharoenpaitoon said yesterday the
perlite was pulverised volcanic rock used in the industry as an
insulator to maintain freezing temperatures in gas containers. He
said it causes skin irritation but it is not flammable or
explosive.

Butler urges cooperation, Baghdad paper calls for end to contact
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Butler's news conference &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons monitor Richard Butler
called Thursday for full Iraqi cooperation with his disarmament
inspectors while Baghdad's most influential newspaper demanded that
its government stops ``courting this mad dog.''
	   Butler arrived in Iraq accompanied by 18 senior U.N. arms
experts who are carrying satellite images, charts and material
evidence to back the U.N. position that Iraq is still hiding
information on illegal weapons.
	   ``What remains is relatively small and with Iraq's full
cooperation we can get this done in a very short time,'' he told
journalists at a news conference hours after his arrival.
	   Iraq has insisted that it has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction and has said that Butler's demands are politically
motivated.
	   The ``time has come to chop the tongue of this dog,'' said
Babil, a newspaper owned by President Saddam Hussein's son, Odai.
	   Iraq has to stop ``courting this mad dog,'' the paper added,
using an epithet the Iraqi press often applies to Butler.
	   Butler's commission is charged by the U.N. Security Council with
certifying that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass
destruction, a process necessary for the lifting of sweeping
sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
	   The dispute between Iraq and the commission has the potential to
rekindle the crisis earlier this year when Iraq refused to open its
presidential sites to U.N. inspections. The United States and
Britain threatened to attack Iraq and war was averted only when
Iraq agreed to open the palaces as part of a deal brokered by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Butler said he brought a list indicating what Iraq needs to do
to obtain a clean bill of health from the commission.
	   ``This list is it,'' he said. ``We have no second list in the
backroom.''
	   He added that his inspectors were ``near the end'' of verifying
Iraq's claim that it had destroyed all the warheads it filled with
chemical and biological agents.
	   Butler is scheduled to hold the first meeting of his five-day
visit with Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on Saturday.
	   Among the key points on Butler's list are:
	   _ Iraq must hand over information on long-range missiles that it
imported.
	   _ Iraq must prove it has scrapped all biological and chemical
warheads and missile fuel.
	   _ Iraq must provide documentation on domestic production of
long-range missiles.
	   _ Iraq must prove that it dismantled unaccounted-for chemical
munitions, including 155mm mustard gas shells and chemical and
biological bombs.
	   _ It must fully account for its past activities in producing the
chemical agent VX.

Israelis, Palestinians secretively discuss Geneva Convention

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian delegates Thursday ended a
secretive, groundbreaking meeting that could start a process for
dealing with Jewish settlements under international law.
	   The talks marked the first time Israel has attended negotiations
that implied any formal recognition that the Geneva Conventions on
the conduct of war have any application to territories it captured
in 1967.
	   The meeting fell far short of Arab and European demands that all
188 countries of the convention be convened to discuss enforcement
against settlement building.
	   Israel fears such an assembly could build pressure on Israel
over the settlements.
	   Israel, a signatory to the Geneva Convention, refuses to accept
its application to the territory it captured in the 1967 Mideast
war, which it maintains is Jewish land.
	   The Convention bans the usurpation of land by an occupying power
_ a provision the Palestinians and the European Union say would ban
settlement building.
	   Swiss sponsors of the talks told reporters after the three-day
session little more than that the two sides would meet again ``in
the near future.''
	   The meeting at a villa near Geneva was the first part of a
package proposed by the Swiss.
	   The second, an experts' meeting in ``early autumn'' of
signatories to the Fourth Geneva Convention, ``will be proposed in
the early days of July,'' said the statement.
	   The two sides have failed to hold substantive peace talks since
Israeli settlement activity chilled discussions a year ago.

	   JUST two days after Monday's accident at a Tanayong project site
in inner Bangkok, a platform attached to a section of the Don Muang
Tollway project fell onto a crowded bus travelling inbound on
Phaholyothin Road yesterday evening.
	   Although the accident, which shattered the windscreen of the Lop
Buri-Bangkok bus, did not result in any casualties it caused
traffic to bank up for several kilometres during the evening rush
hour.
	   Highway police managed to arrange initial negotiations between
the bus driver and Italian-Thai Co, which is in charge of the
construction work, but the result of the talks was not immediately
known.
	   The driver, Sema Towijarn, said the one square metre platform
could have fallen in the middle of the bus had he been driving
faster.
	   Meanwhile, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA)
yesterday reiterated its stance barring Italian Thai Development
Plc from resuming work until it deposits Bt100 million as insurance
against further accidents.
	   The decision came after a five-tonne concrete block fell from a
crane on the Tananyong electric train project during rush hour on
Monday, injuring a worker and damaging two cars below.
	   Prasert yesterday called a meeting of public works authorities
from all infrastructure projects to map out measures to prevent
such accidents.
	   The BMA has ordered Italian Thai to remove all equipment
obstructing traffic, such as cranes, within this week unless it
signs an agreement to deposit Bt100 million that will not be
refunded if there is another accident.
	   ''We need to take this drastic action against the company to
prevent further accidents,'' Prasert said.
	   The city administration has yet to decide how serious accidents
will have to be for the deposit to be seized.
	   Italian Thai engineers will conclude their investigation into
why the line holding the concrete block snapped within two weeks.
	   The concrete block, which fell from an upper tier of the track
bed, landed on a lower tier and did not hit the road below, which
was heavily congested with traffic.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - Work on a new collective agreement between
estate workers and Malaysian Agricultural Producers Association
(Mapa) has begun after the old one expired last month, National
Union of Plantation Workers (NUPW) executive secretary A.
Navamukundan said today. He said the union had forwarded its
memorandum of claims on salary and other benefits to Mapa last
month and were waiting a reply.
	   ``As usual we are asking for better terms and conditions for
employment and living,'' he said. Each collective agreement is for
a period of three years.
	   Navamukundan was responding to a query about the status of a
group of plantation workers who staged a peaceful gathering outside
the gates of the Prime Minister's Department requesting a meeting
with Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad to discuss monthly wages in
place of their current daily wages.
	   A letter was handed to an officer from the Prime Minister's
office at the gates.
	   The group calling itself the Malaysian Support Committee for the
Plantation Community claimed that plantation workers were being
victimised by plantation managments through a low daily-wage
structure while other benefits like annual wage increment and bonus
were not forthcoming.
	   The group also claimed that Mapa and NUPW were unable to work
out a ``good'' wage structure despite having met many times.
	   Its spokesman A. Sivarajan said plantation workers get an
average of RM500 per month and were asking for a monthly minimum of
RM750, a RM50 annual increment, a minimum of one month's annual
bonus and retirement benefits.
	   Navamukundan said NUPW would strive to get the best terms and
conditions for the workers.
	   ``We cannot conclude a collective agreement through the Press or
in the streets.''
	   Navamukundan said there were three categories of plantation
workers who were daily-rated, piece-rated and monthly-rated.
	   On claims by the group that they had to pay for electricity and
water supplies, he said workers were charged for any amount used
above a free- quantum.

	   Facing so many domestic problems, China is unlikely to be the
next economic superpower anytime soon, writes Christopher Lingle.
	   As the impact of the global economy focuses minds towards East
Asia, one of the most widely repeated forecasts is that China's
economy will overtake the US's by 2020. With the endorsement of the
IMF and World Bank, this prediction meets with uncritical approval.
The Clinton administration's thinking on relations with the
People's Republic of China is probably influenced by this
projection.
	   However, the numbers provided by the Chinese authorities and
used by various international organisations may lead to misleading
conclusions. Upon closer reflection, it appears that China is
unlikely to become an economic superpower, at least not soon.
International investors looking to the promise of China's markets
would be well advised to reconsider a number of issues before
betting on the promise of prosperity in the Middle Kingdom. Those
hoping to exploit access to over 1 billion consumers might consider
what must take place before China reaches an adequate level of per
capita income to become a high absorption economy.
	   In the first instance, Chinese economic data are notoriously
unreliable. Honest mistakes should be factored into the mammoth
task of accumulating the raw statistics necessary to come up with
meaningful data. This act would be daunting even for more advanced
data collection systems. However, those who provide much of China's
data at the enterprise or provincial level are long accustomed to
satisfying the numbers fetish of communist bureaucrats.
Consequently, production figures continue to be routinely
exaggerated. The leadership admits this in the increasingly
frequent public admonitions that such actions are no longer
desirable. Alas, old habits seem to die young.
	   In all events, impressions can be misleading. Visitors and
analysts who look to the rapid growth in China's coastal provinces
tend to overlook the dramatic interregional differences in the
level of development. Most of the progress from modernisation of
China's economy is enjoyed by the 10-20 per cent that live in the
maritime regions. Inland, there is considerably less robust levels
of economic growth and large pockets of poor who were severely
punished by the bouts with high inflation in the early 1990s.
	   Much of China remains backward and overall progress continues to
be retarded due to the lack of a national economy. China's various
commercial centres are not interconnected due to underdeveloped
transportation and communications networks. Making matters worse,
internal markets remain segmented also due to interregional
rivalries whereby internal tariffs and ''border'' checks exist
between China's provinces.
	   In order to develop a national economy, China must undertake
massive expenditure on various infrastructure. Projects to build
power stations, bridges, road and railway systems, airports, as
well as educational and training facilities require many hundreds
of billions of dollars. Unfortunately, China's underdeveloped
capital markets will hinder financing of these projects. Even if
there were a clear vision for these projects, the enormity of the
capital commitments are beyond the capacity of domestic sources.
	   Despite having a high rate of domestic saving, these internal
resources are unlikely to be available for long-term investment
projects. Without assured accountability under a rule of law and
greater transparency, it is unlikely that external capital will be
forthcoming.
	   Therefore, a choice must be made between short-run growth or
more long-term investment in infrastructure. In the heady moments
of China's current growth spurt, the leadership will be tempted to
neglect these long-term investments.
	   Another problem is an increasingly large gulf between China's
haves and have-nots. The cause of the worsening distribution of
income cannot be blamed upon the heartlessness of markets. Instead
it is the obsession with control and hierarchy of the Communist
leadership, and the absence of truly free markets, which will
create a wider gulf between rich and poor Chinese citizens. These
problems are a symptom of the endemic corruption that arises from
the extensive presence of bureaucratic control of markets and
economic relations in China.
	   Due to these many pressures, China remains a unitary state in a
condition of arrested disintegration. The political glue that holds
China geographically intact arises from a variety of conditions.
	   First, there is the well-known willingness of the Chinese people
to endure great hardships as the cost of preserving political
order. Second, and of equal importance, the authorities in Beijing
must command both fear and respect from the citizenry. However,
there is a serious problem from the growing sense of resentment
over corruption and nepotism among high-ranking Communist Party
cadres that has added to the weakening of the respect for power at
the centre.
	   China's impressive economic performance brings mixed blessings
for its neighbours. While offering the possibility of being a
locomotive to drive regional growth by serving as a source of
inputs and by serving as a market for outputs, China's new found
strength poses a potential threat to its neighbours.
	   Following modernisation of its economy, China has plans to
modernise its military. This includes an extension of its navy's
reach beyond defence of near-offshore and coastal boundaries.
	   These developments complicate China's territorial claims that
put it on a potential collision course with its neighbours.
	   Facing so many diversions and difficulties, China is unlikely to
be the next economic superpower anytime soon. Until a multiplicity
of internally-generated contradictions are resolved, high-level
economic leadership will out of China's reach.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The government has banned local and foreign
tourists from traveling to northern Iraq, saying American and

	   The havoc wreaked by illicit drugs, unlike in the past, is no
longer confined to the Golden Triangle of Southeast Asia or the
Golden Crescent of Southwest Asia. Drug abuse and trafficking have
truly become a global problem, and as such any attempt to curb the
drug menace will, at the very least, require the highest
cooperation and policy coordination from virtually every country in
the world.
	   In an era where the world is encountering new production
technologies and a slew of designer drugs, this week's United
Nations General Assembly on the World Drug Problem is no doubt part
of an important global effort to combat drug abuse and illicit drug
production.
	   Thailand being a key frontline state in the war against drugs,
has given full support to the UN's global drug strategy adopted
Wednesday, which aims to reduce the number of drug addicts around
the world and to eradicate illegal drug production.
	   Thailand has long been considered a major supply route in
heroin. Not surprisingly, it was one of the major targets of
international anti-drug operations in the past. The situation has
changed somewhat. The production of drugs is now mostly located in
neighbouring countries, and Thailand in turn has become a major
transit hub in drug trafficking as well as an importing centre for
chemicals used in this illicit industry. Because of this, the war
against drugs must not only involve the cooperation of Thailand,
but also all exporting and importing countries.
	   It is also imperative that the drug control measures agreed at
the regional level be fully implemented. This includes the 1993
Memorandum of Understanding on Drug Control among Cambodia, China,
Laos, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam and UN International Drug Control
Department. The MOU is considered the major regional mechanism
aimed at reducing drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking.
Moreover, it offers a much-needed platform for countries in the
region to openly discuss their common drug problem.
	   Given the globalisation of the drug problem, it is about time
that the Narcotics Control Board, chaired by Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai, reinvented itself. To keep pace with international drug
trafficking, this national body must include representatives from
the Foreign Ministry on its the board. Since many aspects of the
drug problem are transnational in nature, these Foreign Ministry
members can help with cross-border negotiations that sometimes must
be done with great diplomacy and tact.
	   In addition, to counter the growing trend in drug consumption
and production, adequate financial assistance must be extended to
poor countries which have serious drug problems, especially those
known to be drug-producing countries. Crop substitution programmes
have proved to be one of the most effective ways to counter drug
production, but more aid is badly needed.
	   Without such additional assistance -- and because of the
on-going economic crisis -- the number of players in the drug
business will certainly balloon, especially those who seek a quick
fortune. The seizure of million of amphetamine tablets in Thailand
shows that we must not remain complacent.
	   Certainly, the adoption of the UN declaration on drugs will
herald a new phase of international drug control cooperation. But
without the highest level of political will and the unwavering
commitment of rich industrialised countries to combat poverty in
drug-producing countries, the war against drugs could be lost even
before it begins.

Controversial paternity test on Yves Montand negative
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from Montand's last companion in 10th
graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERRE-ANTOINE SOUCHARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The results of a DNA test on the corpse of
legendary French singer Yves Montand show he did not father a young
woman who for years claimed to be his love child, judicial sources
said Thursday.
	   ``Montand will be able to rest in peace,'' the singer's adoptive
daughter, Catherine Allegret, later told French radio. She said she
had read the results of the DNA tests which showed Montand was not
the father of Aurore Drossart.
	   Throughout his life, Montand had denied that Drossart, 24, was
his daughter and refused to undergo DNA tests while alive.
	   But after years of trying, Drossart and her mother, Anne, won a
court-ordered exhumation of Montand's corpse from Paris'
Pere-Lachaise cemetery. It was carried out in March. Drossart was
present.
	   Four years ago, a Paris court concluded that Montand was
Aurore's father, on the basis of physical resemblance as well as
the fact the Montand had refused twice to undergo blood tests to
verify the claim.
	   The DNA tests were negative, according to the judicial sources,
who spoke on condition they not be named.
	   Allegret, the adopted daughter, said that finally his family
would be able to ``get out of the nightmare'' that had overshadowed
their lives.
	   ``I am shattered, because I think of the infamy of this
procedure ... the ignominy of this exhumation.'' Allegret said.
There is no reason to be triumphant, she added, ``because it is so
sad and sordid.''
	   Allegret is the daughter of Simone Signoret, Montand's companion
of 36 years who died in 1985. The couple had no children. Montand
had a child, Valentin, in 1988 with his companion, Carole Amiel.
	   ``He always said while he was alive that he didn't have any
responsibility toward this young woman ... It's too bady he wasn't
believed,'' Amiel said on TF1 television.
	   Montand's heirs were horrified by the exhumation so long after
his death in 1991.
	   Geneticists at the Institut Medicolegal in Paris compared DNA
from Montand's teeth to that of Drossart's.
	   Montand was beloved in France, where his melancholy love songs
and cabaret-style ditties won him a loyal following. He also was a
versatile screen actor, starring in movies such as Claude Berri's
``Jean de Florette'' and ``Z,'' by Costa Gavras.
	   ``Les Feuilles Mortes,'' translated into English as ``Autumn
Leaves,'' was one of his most famous love songs.
	   Montand died of a massive heart attack at age 70, three days
before he was to testify in Drossart's paternity suit.

	   DATUK Bandar Tan Sri Kamaruzzaman Sharif has asked the Kuala
Lumpur Tourist Association to create a carnival atmospehere in the
city between Sept 11 and 21 to promote the 16th Commonwealth Games.
	   He said association (KLTA) members who were hoteliers could play
a leading role in this effort.
	   ``During the games, the city will have an influx of foreigners
and we would like everyone especially organisations such as the
KLTA, which has a lot of experience, to promote Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``Tourism is a money spinner and the KLTA should help turn Kuala
Lumpur into a major tourist destination and a shopping haven by
embarking on more aggresive campaigns,'' he said.
	   Kamaruzzaman, also the patron of the 35-year-old association,
praised KLTA member the Taxi, Hired Car and Limousing Operators
Association of West Pahang, Federal Territory and Selangor
(Perpekli) for distributing 200,000 pamphlets on the dos and don'ts
when using taxis.
	   Perpekli president Aslah Abdullah said public response has been
encouraging towards taxi use after the launching of the pamphlets
by Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Mustapa Mohamed in
March.
	   Kamaruzzaman had earlier received new KLTA executive committee
members led by its new chairman Jamaliah Aris who called on him at
his office in Jalan Raja Laut. They were elected during the KLTA
annual meeting on April 29.
	   Jamaliah said KLTA would be participating in several programmes
this year including the KLTA Vision Four Florathon '98 on June 28,
Floral Parade on July 5, and Florex '98 - Floriculture Exhibition
between July 9 and 12.
	   She said the KLTA Vision Four Florathon '98 would be flagged off
at the Dataran Merdeka at 7.30am and was open to the public.
	   ``It will involve a two-km walk along Dataran Merdeka and the
Lake Gardens in your best floral togs and merit is given to
flower-power and not speed.
	   ``Participants from all ages can expect to walk away with
fabulous prizes.
	   ``The theme is Games &AMP; Pastimes and participation fee for both
the national and international categories are: individual (adult) -
RM12; children below 12 - RM6; family (maximum of five) - RM50;
senior citizen - RM6; and company - RM100,'' she said.
	   Jamaliah said last year's event attracted 800 participants
including foreign tourists.
	   She said KLTA would also be participating in the Floral Parade
this year, to be held between 8am and 10am on July 5 at te Dataran
Merdeka.
	   She said KLTA would also be organising a four-day Florex '98 -
Floriculture Exhibition at the Amcorp Mall in Petaling Jaya from
July 9.
	   She said it was a significant and important flower exposition
which would be an excellent platform for exhibitors in the
floriculture and horticulture industries to promote their products
and services.
	   Visitors to the exhibition will be able to view flowers, greens,
landscaping services, floriculture equipment, floral accessories,
tissue cultures, green/glass houses, bonsai and publications.

	   BARISAN Nasional backbencher Hilmi Rashid (BN-Bertam) yesterday
criticised the local authority for approving the establishment of
an entertainment outlet between two secondary schools in Kepala
Batas.
	   Hilmi said he learnt that the authority had allowed the outlet a
permit to operate between Sekolah Menengah Datuk Abdul Kader and
Sekolah Menengah Datuk Ahmad Badawi.
	   ``I will go there (entertainment outlet) and find out which
officer approved and signed the licence.
	   ``The office should be more sensitive, especially when approving
such entertainment outlets in areas where schools are located,'' he
said when debating the Bill on Entertainment and Places of
Entertainment Enactment 1997.
	   Jasmin Mohamed (BN-Sungai Dua) said the authorities should stop
approving permits for such outlets in small towns and rural
districts.
	   ``I am sure tourists will not patronise outlets in such areas so
why allow them a permit in the first place?'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes struck suspected
guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon Thursday shortly after
guerrillas killed an Israeli-allied militiaman and wounded another,
security officials said.
	   Two Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface missiles at a valley
near the town of Joun, 15 kilometers (9 miles) north of the town of
Jezzine, the scene of the guerrilla attack.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the attack.
	   Lebanese army anti-aircraft gunners opened fire on the raiding
jets, but missed, the Lebanese officials said, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   The attack came less than three hours after guerrillas shot an
anti-tank missile at a vehicle carrying members of an
Israeli-allied militia, killing one militiaman and wounding
another, security officials said.
	   The vehicle was traveling near Jezzine, which is controlled by
the militia. Jezzine is 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) north of
Marjayoun, the main town in an Israeli-occupied border enclave in
south Lebanon.
	   Militia officials confirmed the two casualties, but declined to
give their names or ranks. The 2,500-strong militia is funded,
trained and equipped by Israel.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group claimed
responsibility for the attack.
	   In a statement issued in Sidon, provincial capital of southern
Lebanon, the fundamentalist Shiite Muslim group said its guerrillas
ambushed a militia convoy, killing a militia official and wounding
three other fighters.
	   There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy in the
number of wounded militiamen.
	   Hezbollah, or Party of God, has in the past targeted Israeli
troops and their allied militiamen with missiles and roadside bombs
as part of a war of attrition to oust them from the zone they have
occupied since 1985.

	   THE State Government may seek to list on the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange the company which will take over the operations of the
Penang Water Authority once it is corporatised.
	   Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu Koon (BN-Tanjung Bunga) said
there was a possibility that PWA's successor company would be
listed on the KLSE, subject to its performance and the country's
economic recovery.
	   ``The option to list, however, is not a priority since the
company should focus on ensuring quality water supply and providing
superior service to consumers,'' he said when replying to points
raised on the Penang Water Authority (Successor Company) Enactment
1998.
	   Koh said if the successor company was to be listed, the State
Government would be the majority shareholder.
	   He also said that issues such water rates would be determined by
the State Government and not the company.
	   He said although the PWA had chalked profits totalling RM208
million between 1993 and 1997, the authority had incurred capital
expenditures totalling RM291 million during the corresponding
period.
	   Seberang Jaya Assemblyman Datuk Abdul Latiff Mirasa said the
State Government should ensure the soon-to-be corporatised
authority did not increase water rates, but instead, take the lead
to reduce rates.
	   ``Water rates can be reduced through efficient management,'' he
added, saying that the welfare of the PWA employees should also be
a priority in the corporatisation exercise.
	   Meanwhile when debating the Water Supply Enactment 1998,
backbencher Syed Ameruddin Syed Ahmad (BN-Teluk Kumbar) asked whose
responsibility it was to ensure that water catchment areas were
protected.
	   Syed Ameruddin and sole Opposition member Chong Eng (DAP-Batu
Lanchang) said although there were already existing laws to protect
the State's water resources and supply, enforcement was lacking.
	   Bayan Lepas assemblyman Lim Chien Aun also proposed an ``amnesty
period'' for users of wells in the State once all water catchment
areas were gazetted.

	   Paris-based Touristcard Co has launched the cards in seven
cities in France and is in the process of placing the product in
other European tourist destinations including London, Rome and
Madrid.
	   Jean-Michael Perez, managing director of Michael Thomas
International, the licensee for Asia, is confident that between 3
million and 4 million cards will be distributed during the Amazing
Thailand 1998-1999 campaign.
	   He said the cards would be heavily promoted in all international
travel markets, and would be available mainly through travel agents
and airline offices in Europe, the United States and Japan. Outlets
that accept the card will be carefully screened to ensure high
service standards and to help increase tourism revenue for the
country.
	   Perez said three factors contributed to the selection of
Thailand for the first launch in Asia -- good tourism potential,
high-quality tourist attractions and the Amazing Thailand campaign.
	   ''The impressive market response indicates that Thailand stands
to benefit substantially from this product. Tourists will enjoy the
privileges offered to them while in Thailand,'' he said.
	   The company is targeting five locations -- Bangkok, Pattaya,
Chiang Mai, Koh Samui and Phuket.
	   The general manager of Touristcard Co, Xavier Levavasseur, said
the card has been successful in France because of its
benefit-sharing strategy. Cardholders stand to gain the most, he
said.
	   Cardholders are entitled to two-tier benefits -- special
discounts on tourism-related services, and points that can be
collected to earn extra gifts. ''It is a family card because as
many as six people can use the card at one time, and the right to
use the card is also transferable,'' he said.

	   THE House yesterday passed the Entertainment and Places of
Entertainment Enactment 1997 which provides for the licensing and
regulation of entertainment and places of public entertainment in
the State.
	   With the implementation of the Bill, the Theatres and Places of
Public Amusement Enactment 1958 will cease to be in force.
	   In tabling the Bill, Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu Koon
(BN-Tanjung Bunga) said although the basic features of the existing
Enactment were retained in the Bill, it however sought to define in
greater detail the activities to be controlled.
	   ``It also seeks to provide for heavier penalties for offences
committed under the proposed Enactment.''
	   Koh said the existing enactment was enforced since December 1958
although ``the form of entertainment and entertainment places had
since changed and involve a much wider scope.'' Also, he said,
places of entertainment for the public had increased.
	   ``Which is why it is necessary to control and enforce such
activities.
	   Furthermore, entertainment outlets have been identified as one
of the sources of social ills,'' he said.
	   Koh said the new Bill would seek to confer upon authorised
officers powers of enforcement which, under the existing Enactment,
were only conferred on police officers.
	   It however contains provisions for the exemption of action
against entertainment held for religious, educational,
recreational, social, welfare, and charitable purposes.

Catholic bishops warn of crisis spawned by corruption, greed,

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Roman Catholic bishops warned Thursday
of a growing political and economic crisis in Zimbabwe and called
for moral renewal and a fairer sharing of resources.
	   The eight clerics in the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops' Conference
said they were expressing concerns voiced to priests in daily
contact with parishioners across the country.
	   Nearly three fourths of the population of 12.5 million lived in
poverty while ``large amounts of public money are spent on apparent
luxuries'' by the nation's leaders,'' the bishops said in a
pastoral statement circulated Thursday.
	   The four-page statement was submitted to President Robert
Mugabe, himself a Catholic, and lawmakers at the 150-seat
Parliament in Harare.
	   ``Wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few and the poverty
that is there is growing and its effects are severe,'' the bishops
wrote. ``Inefficiency and corruption must be weeded out.''
	   Intimidation and threats to political opponents also blocked
political dialogue and much-needed constitutional reform, the
statement said.
	   Unrest over deteriorating economic conditions and government
corruption has posed the most serious threat to Mugabe, the only
black ruler of this former British colony since it gained
independence in 1980.
	   In January, troops backed by armored cars and helicopters
quelled riots over food-price increases of more than 25 percent.
	   At least five people died from gunshot wounds. It was the first
time the government had called out troops to crush civil unrest.
	   In November, the Zimbabwe dollar plunged by nearly 60 percent in
value against the U.S. currency. Inflation has exceeded 30 percent
and unemployment is estimated at around 50 percent of the work
force.

	   KUALA Lumpur City Hall can divert the RM100 million allocated
annually for cleaning of clogged drains and polluted rivers to
development if the public is more civic-conscious and takes care of
waterways.
	   Datuk Bandar Tan Sri Kamaruzzaman Shariff said the public should
change its attitude and care for the city.
	   He said City Hall would launch its ``Care for your Rivers and
Drains''
	   campaign in August in conjunction with the 1998 Commonwealth
Games the following month.
	   Kamaruzzaman hoped the campaign would help instil a love for
rivers among the people.
	   He was speaking to reporters after receiving a cheque for
RM57,500 from Esso at the Kuala Lumpur Memorial Library.
	   Three libraries in Jalan Jelatek, Desa Tun Razak and Gombak will
receive RM52,500, with the balance going to City Hall to help
design and produce multimedia software on CD-ROM.
	   ``The authorities spend a lot of money cleaning drains and
rivers. We are doing our best to keep the city clean. But the
public will have to play its part as well.
	   ``The people will have to change their attitude and play their
part as responsible citizens.''
	   He added that it was vital for Kuala Lumpur to project a clean
image to visitors attending the Commonwealth Games.
	   Asked about recent flash floods at Jalan Silang, he said this
was due to a clogged drain.
	   Kamaruzzaman said it was not only the responsibility of City
Hall and Alam Flora to pick up rubbish.
	   ``The drains and rivers have become a rubbish dump for the
public. We have tried to do everything and spent a lot of money
annually but the public still insists on throwing rubbish into
drains.
	   ``There was an incident in Pantai Dalam where the contractor
dumped construction debris into the drain. When the authorities
cleaned the drain, they found a big container and rubbish from the
construction site.''
	   Kamaruzzaman added that anyone found polluting rivers and drains
would be prosecuted.
	   Meanwhile, he said the relocation of traders and hawkers from
the Chow Kit wet market to the temporary market in Jalan Ipoh was
still on.
	   He said the traders and hawkers will be relocated after the 1998
Commonwealth Games.
	   City Hall is still discussing the method of relocating the
traders.

	   THE State Government should ensure that water rates will not be
increased at least for the first three years following the
corporatisation of the Penang Water Authority.
	   Dr Teng Hock Nan (BN-Kebun Bunga) said even if the rates were to
be increased eventually, the PWA must ensure that it is increased
for the business sector and not for householders.
	   ``I asked for three years because the current economic situation
is expected to take three years to recover,'' he said.
	   Dr Teng was debating the Penang Water Authority (Successor
Company) Enactment 1998 and Water Supply Enactment 1998 Bills.
	   He urged the State Government to ensure the water supply was
clean and not contaminated.
	   Tan Cheng Liang (BN-Jawi) also urged the State Government to
ensure water rates were not raised after corporatisation as the PWA
had enough money.
	   She also called for a map to be made of all underground pipes.
	   ``By having such an underground pipe mapping, utility workers
carrying out diggings will be able to avoid damaging undergroud
pipes and disrupt the water supply,''.

World Cup: Argentina not taking anything for granted against Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VICENTE LEONARDO PANETTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   L'ETRAT, France (AP) _ Powerhouse Argentina has endured enough
humiliations in its World Cup debuts to know it cannot take
anything for granted against Japan on Sunday.
	   Thus, head coach Daniel Passarella has been drilling his
starters in the style used by the Japanese defense, which includes
one sweeper, two stoppers and quick counterattacks.
	   ``Japan also changes defenders and sometimes plays with two
sweepers and only one stopper,'' said Passarella, who last week
traveled from this small French village to Switzerland to scout
Japan in a match it lost to Yugoslavia 1-0.
	   At first glance, Japan seems easy prey to the powerful
Argentines, the favorites in Group H, which also includes debutants
Jamaica and Croatia. But Argentina is keenly aware of the many
blows it has endured in first matches of its brilliant World Cup
history.
	   ``We have to be careful with Japan. We can't take them for
granted because they could surprise us,'' said Passarella, who as a
player suffered through one of those early losses against weaker
teams.
	   In 1982, with Passarella and Diego Maradona at the height of
their game, Argentina went to Spain having won the title four years
before in Buenos Aires, but lost 1-0 to Belgium in the opener.
	   In 1990, with Passarella already retired and the Maradona star
beginning to dim, Argentina once again showed up as world champion
in Italy, having won in Mexico. But lowly Cameroon shocked the
soccer world by defeating the Argentines 1-0 in the first match.
The team recovered and reached the final, where it lost 1-0 to West
Germany.
	   Four years later, however, in the United States, Argentina made
easy work of Greece and won 4-0, with three goals by rising star
Gabriel Batistuta and one by Maradona, who was kicked out a few
days later after failing a drug test.
	   Even though they are among the favorites to reach the final, the
Argentines are making sure they do not to underestimate Japan,
Jamaica and Croatia, all of them newcomers to World Cup play.
	   Batistuta, now in his second World Cup, says the Japanese are
``young and combative. Besides, one should never tally points until
they've been earned.''
	   Just as a reminder, the South Americans should bear in mind
Japan's 3-2 win over Argentina in the Tokyo Olympics in 1964.

	   THE Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand says it will
sell a further 4.1 per cent of its equity in Electricity Generating
Plc within 12 months after the first stake was sold to strategic
investors.
	   Deputy Egat governor Boonchoo Direksathapon said the state
agency agreed to relax conditions for selling an additional 4.1 per
cent in Egco either through a capital increase or a stake
reduction.
	   The timeframe of one year after Egat has sold a 14.9 per cent
stake in Egco is hoped to restore the confidence of foreign
investors, who would prefer to play a greater role in Egco with a
19 per cent stake. It is also expected to increase the share price.
	   Based on a recent Cabinet resolution, a strategic foreign
investor will be selected to purchase a 14.9 per cent stake in Egco
with an option for a further 4.1 per cent later.
	   The change in conditions followed a marketing trip to China,
Singapore, Malaysia, France and the United States between May 17
and June 2, which attracted interest from six bidders -- Hong
Kong's China Light and Power, Singapore Power, YTL of Malaysia,
Electricite de France and US companies Edison Mission and El Paso.
	   Egat is scheduled to select the winning bidder for the 79.5
million Egco shares next monthly after the bidders have submitted
their tenders on June 26. The final bidding package will be
proposed to investors tomorrow.
	   Boonchoo said if Egco does not increase its registered capital
within 12 months Egat will reduce its holding by 4.1 per cent. When
it tries to raise capital, if Egat is unable to pay for the
increase, it will allow the strategic partner to purchase the
unsubscribed portion.
	   Egat, which currently has a 40.7 per cent stake, expects the
price of the Egco shares to exceed the market price. Egco Wednesday
traded at Bt53, down Bt1.50.
	   Boonchoo said earlier that the estimated price of Egco shares is
Bt80 apiece, which would generate Bt6.36 billion based on the 79.5
million share option.
	   Egat will use proceeds from the sale for business expansion and
its employees fund. The remainder will be contributed to the poor
development fund and the Financial Institutions Development Fund.
	   Egco operates two combined-cycle power stations in Rayong and
Surat Thani provinces with a combined generating capacity of 2,000
megawatts.

	   THE State Legislative Assembly yesterday passed two Bills
allowing for the corporatisation of the Penang Water Authority and
the creation of a successor company.
	   With the passing of the Water Supply Enactment 1998 and the
Penang Water Authority (Successor Company) Enactment 1998, a fully
State-owned company will take over the management and supply of
water in the State once the Bills are gazetted.
	   The Bills also call for the creation of a regulatory authority
and the post of Water Supply director, give power to the State to
declare any area as a water catchment area and increase penalties
for offences such as tampering with meters or diverting rivers.
	   The Bills were approved after a day of debate with every
assemblyman who urged against raising water rates following
corporatisation. They wanted an improvement in service and an
assurance there would be no abuse of power or high-handedness,
especially since penalties were high.
	   The Water Supply Enactment seeks to make provisions for the
supply of water in the State and the Penang Water Authority
(Successor Company) Enactment 1998 provides for the vesting of
property, rights and liabilities of the PWA in a company to be
formed.
	   In tabling the Bills, Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu Koon
(BN-Tanjung Bunga) said corporatisation would enhance the
efficiency of the water authority's operation in two aspects: ``The
first is its financial management and the other being its handling
of provisions relating to staff.''
	   He said the Water Supply Enactment 1998 conferred power on the
State to expressly declare any area to be a catchment area and the
types of activities which may be permitted in such areas. He said
the State Government did not now have ``express power'' to declare
any area a catchment area and therefore effectively act against
those damaging such areas.
	   ``The State authorities will also be empowered to make
regulations to prevent pollution, contamination or siltation of
catchment areas.''
	   Koh said the existing penalties for offences were unrealistic
and the Bill sought to increase them. For instance, anyone damaging
the water supply system or diverting rivers will be liable to a
fine not exceeding RM50,000 or a jail term of not more than two
years or both.
	   ``Water is an expensive commodity especially in Penang where the
source of supply is limited and needs to be protected from whatever
implications that can disrupts water supply.''

	   ROBINSON Department Store Plc has temporarily suspended YEN 6.8
billion in interest payments on loans due in 2000 in order to
restructure its debt, the company told the Stock Exchange of
Thailand.
	   Robinson recently appointed US-based Bankers Trust Co to advise
it on the restructuring process.
	   The listed company, part of Central Retail Corp (CRC), said it
plans to resume payments after completing its financial
restructuring, which is expected to take six months.
	   Robinson said the temporary suspension of payments will not
affect any suppliers.
	   ''Many companies in the private sector engaged in offshore
borrowing are now being hit hard by the large increase in their
debt servicing requirements, and Robinson is no exception,'' said
chief operating officer Kanok Wongtrangan. He said many companies
are negotiating with their creditors as they struggle to adjust to
the new operating environment.
	   Kanok said that as a result of the baht devaluation, Robinson
has taken the pro-active step of commencing a financial
restructuring. The company is arranging to negotiate with its
creditors for a debt restructuring.
	   Robinson expects this year's sales to reach Bt7 billion, down 10
to 15 per cent from its previous sales target of Bt9 billion for
1998.
	   This excludes electrical appliances, sporting goods and
supermarket sales, which were spun off into separate operations
earlier this year.
	   Last year, it recorded sales of Bt17 billion, including the
spun-off units.
	   This year's sales at Power Buy, its electrical appliance unit,
are projected at Bt7 billion and Bt2 billion at its Super Sport
unit. Robinson is part of CRC, a joint venture with Central.
	   The department store experienced over a 40 per cent drop in
sales last year, mainly due to intense competition between
department and discount stores as well as a sharp fall in consumer
demand, an analyst at Cathay Capital Security said.
	   The analyst said huge foreign exchange losses have substantially
increased the company's interest burden and dragged shareholders'
funds into negative territory. Furthermore, Robinson has a vast
amount of unsecured debentures due to mature next year and in 2000,
which is has little chance of repaying given the current economic
situation.
	   The analyst said the baht devaluation last year created a huge
burden for Robinson, which has issued over US$250 million in
debentures and incurs Bt1 billion every year in interest payments.
	   ''Immense forex losses have eaten away at Robinson's
shareholders' funds and the company is in desperate need of new
capital to boost its liquidity and redeem its debentures, which are
due in 1999 and 2000,'' the analyst said, adding that although the
company expected the amount to be rolled over, the creditors are
unlikely to oblige.
	   ''From our preliminary calculations, Robinson needs to raise as
much as Bt5 billion in fresh capital before 2000. This, of course,
seems unlikely amid current market conditions. And with its parent
company, Central Group, suffering from its own liquidity problems,
Robinson needs new partners to bail the company out of its
crisis,'' said the analyst.
	   Suthichart Chirathivat, CRC chief executive officer, said in a
recent interview that Central has taken the right step in merging
with Robinson.
	   ''It is not an issue of mis-management at Robinson that has
caused the department store to shoulder huge debts,'' Suthichart
said. He added that Robinson has unfortunately been affected by
forex losses after the government chose to cut the baht loose in
July last year.
	   However, Robinson claimed the temporary halt to its debt
payments does not indicate that the department store is
experiencing operating problems.
	   Kanok said Robinson's sales for the first five months of the
year reached 98 per cent of its forecast figure.
	   He added that the company's operating profit for the first
quarter was 9.4 per cent higher than last year following the
implementation of new strategies to improve efficiency, especially
inventory and expense control measures.

	   THE Telephone Organisation of Thailand announced Wednesday it
posted a net profit of Bt9.9 billion for its first two fiscal
quarters ended in March -- 57.7 per cent above expectations.
	   However, TOT said some of the profit is unrealised. The agency
declined to provide details, but said some private companies have
yet to pay interconnection charges and leased-line fees.
	   TOT president Thongchai Yongcharoen said the agency realises the
firms are facing tight financial conditions and is willing to
negotiate with them.
	   ''We will be as flexible as possible,'' Thongchai said.
	   Operating and other expenses were lower than expected partly
because of the stronger baht in February and March, which reduced
currency exchange losses.
	   Since the early 1990's, when it started awarding concessions to
the private sector, TOT has earned about Bt22 billion in royalties.
	   Meanwhile, TOT reported that connected lines in the country
increased slightly to 4.93 million, or a rise of 0.97 per cent from
the first fiscal quarter ended December. The connected lines amount
to 68.14 per cent of the total 7.24 million lines installed.
	   The economic crisis has continued to affect the growth of
telephone registrations, not only on TOT's network but also those
of its two private telephone concessionaires.
	   TelecomAsia Corp installs and serves telephone lines in Bangkok
and nearby provinces, while Thai Telephone &AMP; Telecommunication does
the same for the rest of the country.
	   ''The January to March period saw the lowest bookings for new
telephone numbers in seven years,'' TOT said.
	   TA registered a total of 11,107 telephone numbers during the
period, but the number of telephone numbers provided by TOT has
fallen for two consecutive years. During the quarter, 7,566 TOT
numbers were cancelled.
	   TOT currently operates 51.05 per cent of all subscribed
telephone lines in the country.
	   ''TOT is paying more attention to existing subscribers. It's
difficult to attract customers now,'' the state agency said.
	   Cellular phone growth has also slowed. The three cellular phone
systems -- NMT470, NMT900 and GSM900 -- had 1.15 million registered
numbers, up 1.35 per cent, but lower growth than in the first
fiscal quarter which saw 2.7 per cent growth.
	   The NMT470 network saw the cancellation of 7,096 numbers at the
end of March. The NMT900 network lost 4,925 numbers while the
GSM900 network won 27,578 new numbers in the second fiscal quarter.
	   In fiscal 1997 ended September the state agency reported revenue
of Bt41.1 billion and a net profit of Bt22.5 billion. Its operating
profit amounted to Bt20 billion.

	   THAILAND is to host one of the biggest and most significant
international gems events this year -- the World Diamond Congress.
	   Held every two years, the Congress is organised in conjunction
with the World Federation of Diamond Bourses and the International
Diamond Manufacturers Association. This year the organisers will
also include the Bangkok Diamonds and Precious Stones Exchange and
the Thai Diamond Manufacturers Association.
	   ''Thailand has in recent years emerged as the regional centre
for diamond cutting and trading,'' says Department of Export
Promotion director Gen Sanit Vorapanya. ''At the same time our gems
and jewellery industry has grown into a major export sector.
	   ''This is a very opportune time for us to host this prestigious
event.'' To be held in Bangkok from July 26 to 29 at the Shangri-La
Hotel, the 28th World Diamond Congress will attract more than 300
industry professionals from the World Federation of Diamond Bourses
and the International Diamond Manufacturers Association, together
with representatives from major gems companies worldwide.
	   Although Thailand has a long tradition of gemstone mining, the
gems and jewellery industry has only developed over the past 30
years.
	   With strong government support, especially through the Ministry
of Commerce and the Board of Investment, Thailand has, however,
emerged as one of the world's leading exporters of gems and
jewellery.
	   The industry ranks as Thailand's sixth largest export earner,
and its 10 top overseas markets are the United States, Belgium,
Israel, Germany, Switzerland, France, the United Kingdom, Hong
Kong, Japan and Singapore. Together they account for about 90 per
cent of the Kingdom's total gems and jewellery exports.
	   An important development in the industry came in 1981 when the
Thai government abolished import and export duties on diamonds,
which has led to the Kingdom becoming a lapidary hub where
gemstones from around the world are shipped to be processed.
	   In fact, diamonds account for the largest value of imported gems
totalling 86 per cent of all the precious stones brought into the
country in 1987. The main countries of origin are the US, Israel,
Ghana and the Congo.
	   Both the Thai government and the private sector share the same
vision of Thailand increasingly developing into a leading world
centre for gems and jewellery production and trading.

	   THIRTEEN years after completion, the UMW Group decided that the
Shah Alam Municipal Council would be a better guardian of the clock
tower whih the group built in 1985.
	   At a special handover ceremony recently, UMW Group managing
director Wan Salleh Mohamad said the clock tower was built in
conjunction with Sultan of Selangor Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz
Shah's 25 years of successful administration.
	   ``Apart from commemorating the Sultan's 25 years in office ,the
tower is also a contribution from us to the people of Shah Alam,''
Wan Salleh said.
	   He said the clock tower had 25 steps signifying 25 years of the
Sultan's reign and the three main pillars holding the clock and the
State symbolises the three major races in Malaysia.
	   He added that it was decided that the clock tower should be
surrendered to the local council for better care and maintenance.
	   Asked why UMW Group did not continue to maintain the clock
tower, Wan Salleh said as a corporate member of the society, the
UMW Group wanted to remain in the background.
	   ``We don't even want people to know that it is from us because
it is not our intention to seek publicity through contributions.''
	   Present to receive the model clock tower from Wan Salleh was
MPSA president Mohammad Adzib Mohd Isa.
	   The clock tower is located at Section 15 roundabout and was
contructed at a cost of RM500,000. It sits on Government land.
	   The UMW Group is RM3 million company and is among the foremost
corporations listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange.
	   It has assets in excess of RM578 million and has a workforce of
more than 6,000.

	   HONG KONG -- The grip of high interest rates in Southeast Asia
is showing the failure of the International Monetary Fund
programmes and will lead several nations to permit higher
inflation, according to a Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co analyst who has
sharply reduced his 1998 expectations for regional currency
exchange rates.
	   ''The crisis economies need lower real interest rates. The lack
of a framework for monetary policy [adjustment under the IMF
programmes] means there is no credible means of reducing nominal
interest rates without exchange rates in these countries going
down.
	   For this reason, we consider it more likely that real rates will
be reduced by means of an acceleration of inflation. Monetisation
of a larger fiscal deficit will deliver the higher inflation, in
our view,'' said the report from Tim Condon, an economist for
Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong.
	   Morgan Stanley is the first international investment bank to
strongly question the validity of the IMF programmes. In Bangkok,
the president of a major commercial bank, who asked not to be
named, said such critical view is in the minority and given the
strong interests by foreign investors in Thai assets, most believe
in the IMF's recovery story for Thailand. ''Otherwise they wouldn't
be here in force to invest in Thai assets.'' The Thai IMF programme
carries for roadmap components -- restoring confidence of the
international financial community (completed), recapitalisation of
financial institutions (in progress) and restructuring loans of
domestic borrowers, external loan inflows from world institutions
such as World Bank and Asian Development Bank (almost completed)
and global bond issue by the Thai government.
	   ''The global bond issue will establish a benchmark for corporate
borrowers,'' said the banker.
	   He also said the government is keen to establish an arbitration
for the banks to help their clients restructure the debts, move
them out of the non-performing loan classification and provide new
loans through the bank recapitalisation.
	   ''The recovery story is credible ... Yes, I agree that time is
the main problem, however,'' said the banker.
	   Meanwhile, the Morgan Stanley report, published Wednesday,
offers a view that Southeast Asian currency exchange rates will
sharply fall until the year-end.
	   The firm's analysis emphasises the lack of money supply growth
around the region as shown by rises in the M1 and M2 multipliers.
Everyone is holding deposits, with consumers apparently fearing
deflation and investors sidelined, the report said.
	   Deflation has been seen in two of the past three months in South
Korea, while inflation has dropped to about zero in Thailand,
according to the report. ''A sharp drop in the velocity of money is
terribly destabilising to economic activity,'' the report said.
''The IMF programmes have caused the drop in velocity.
	   ''The IMF programs are failing, in our view, because they
underestimate the time it will take for foreign capital to flow
back into the crisis economies,'' according to the report.
''Meanwhile, the stabilisation of currencies in the IMF-supervised
countries has crushed economic activity.'' Indonesia ''has shown
the way'' by letting its inflation rates rise, even as credit
remains tight. It will probably become a high-inflation economy,
although not a hyper-inflationary environment, according to Morgan
Stanley.
	   ''Higher inflation -- not hyperinflation -- need not be
catastrophic. High inflation has been part of the re-capitalisation
process following financial crises in many emerging markets. Asia
has long been an inflation-resistant region, and we do not forecast
any country moving into destabilising high inflation,'' Condon's
report said.
	   The firm now sees next year's annual inflation rates at 25 per
cent for Indonesia, 9 per cent for Malaysia, 7 per cent for the
Philippines, 10 per cent for Thailand and 2 per cent for Singapore.
South Korea will record 10 per cent inflation in 1999, the firm's
report said.
	   The higher inflation rates will put downward pressure on nominal
exchange rates and make it more difficult for corporate borrowers
to repay their external debt, increasing the need for private
external debt restructuring.
	   The report forecast that many Asian currencies will continue
weakening through 1999. The rupiah and baht are seen stabilising at
end-1998 levels, but the won, ringgit and Singapore dollar are all
seen going lower. The Philippine peso could strengthen in 1999,
according to the report.
	   Morgan Stanley's bearishness on Asian currencies follows a
report from Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co earlier in the week that said
international fund managers are reluctant to invest in Asian
markets and have currency concerns.
	   ''Fund managers have turned sellers of almost all the markets of
Asia,'' said Merrill, citing the results of a survey it conducted.
''Only 15 per cent of [fund] managers based in the Pacific region
expect to see stronger [underlying economic] activity over the
coming year, down from 27 per cent last month.''

	   IN conjunction with the King's birthday celebration on June 6,
the Shangri-La Hotel Kuala Lumpur presented a whopping 250kg
birthday cake to the King at his palace recently.
	   The cake measured about two metres long, one-and-a-half-metre
wide and a metre high.
	   The hotel executive pastry chef and his seven-member team worked
day and night for a month, which resulted in a masterpiece of
intricate designs.
	   Seven pedestals of different heights, made from icing sugar were
placed on top of the cake, each holding a platform.
	   On the platform, sketch portraits spanning the various stages of
His Majesty's life were displayed.
	   The sketches varied from his childhood days to school days, his
career as a diplomat, his marriage, succession to the throne and
His Majesty's present portrait.
	   The cake was presented to the King by the hotel general manager
Mark J.
	   Heywood who was accompanied by the executive pastry chef Herve
Potus, executive chef Horst Fuetterer, sous chef Tan Kong Eng,
pastry chef Teh Chee Fook and chief artist Ramlan Rus Abu.
	   Meanwhile, the Renaissance and New World Hotel Kuala Lumpur
presented a cake measuring about two sq metres and weighed more
than 100 kg to the King.
	   The ``musical instruments'' decorations were made of sugar as
the base and coated with chocolate featuring a violin, trumpet,
saxaphone, drum and harp while the cake resembled a piano.
	   Hotel pastry chef Robert Polz said: ``We decided to present a
cake resembling musical instruments since the Agong loves classical
music and the arts.''
	   He said a team of three chefs took about two weeks to finish the
decorations alone.
	   The chefs who had been working to complete the decorations were
Polz, assistant pastry chef Patrick Song Eng Kiew and first commis
Nafisah Mohd Ali.
	   The Federal Hotels International group in Malaysia comprising
the Federal Hotel, The Crown Princess Kuala Lumpur, The Fairlane
Hotel, Hotel Capitol and Ferringhi Beach Hotel, Penang also
presented a birthday cake to the King.
	   Made in the shape of an antique chest with intricate chocolate
carvings, the cake weighed 50kg.
	   On the top drawer of the chest, the fillings comprised pralines
and mini truffles while the lower section was a sliding tray of
fruit cake covered with yellow icing.
	   On the exterior, the King's royal head dress made of solid
chocolate was majestically placed on a golden pillow.
	   The elaborate cake was designed by the pastry kicthen team, led
by the executive pastry chef Karamir Godrei of the Crown Princess
Kuala Lumpur.
	   The Sunway Lagoon Resort Hotel presented a rich chocolate cake
named A Vintage Rendition where three miniature vintage cars
resembling the ones owned by the King were created.
	   The vintage cars were a 1907 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost, a 1931
Rolls Royce P11 Continental Special Sports Saloon and a 1961 MGA.
	   These vintage cars were carved out of rich chocolate and covered
with marzipan.
	   Weighing 40kg, the creation was the brainchild of the hotel
general manager Georges Chauve.

	   JOHOR BARU, Wed. - Johor, which was once the favourite landing
point for Indonesian illegal immigrants, recorded no such landings
at all over the past month, Menteri Besar Datuk Abdul Ghani Othman
said today.
	   What is more surprising is that the trend now appears to have
reversed.
	   Hundreds of illegal immigrants have been nabbed by Johor police
over the past two months trying to leave the country ``illegally''
by sea.
	   ``There were zero landings of illegal immigrants over the past
month,''
	   Ghani told reporters after chairing the State Executive Council
meeting today.
	   ``Many illegal immigrants are in fact trying to find their way
back to Indonesia, probably because they feel it will be safer for
themselves and their families if they return.''
	   Ghani said such immigrants preferred to leave illegally because
they feared being separated from family members if caught by the
authorities and sent to detention centres.
	   State Traffic Police and Public Order division chief
Superintendent Ajis Salimin said political and economic problems in
Indonesia were probably the main reason for the drop in numbers.
	   ``In the past, the illegal immigrants had to borrow money, pawn
their jewellery and sell their lands and belongings to pay the
tekong fare to come across illegally,'' Ajis said.
	   ``Since times are hard, many are unable to find the money to pay
the tekong.
	   ``Also, tougher enforcement here and the reluctance of employers
to hire them, has made the situation here unattractive, and they
probably find that they are better off staying put in their own
country.''
	   Johor, with its long coastline and its proximity to Indonesia,
has traditionally been a landing point for illegal immigrants.
	   The number of illegal landings increased sharply after the the
regional currency problem last year.
	   The problem reached critical point early this year, when
thousands of illegal immigrants were caught trying to sneak into
the country.
	   About 4,000 illegals were arrested in Johor in the first three
months alone, as compared to 5,500 for the whole of last year.
	   The scenario has now changed. Ajis said about 70 illegal
immigrants had been nabbed trying to leave the country illegally in
June alone.
	   An estimated 200 illegals were similarly caught last month. Ajis
said most of them were taking their savings - accumulated from work
here - with them.
	   Ajis contended that the illegals probably chose not to go home
via legal channels, so as to avoid paying fines or dealing with the
immigration authorities.
	   Ghani meanwhile said the State authorities would closely monitor
the situation after Aug 15, when the permits of a large number of
immigrant workers would expire.

	   THAI Airways International is well-prepared for any problems
related to the so-called ''millennium bug'', the computer glitch
that will make many old generation computers and software worldwide
unworkable after Dec 31, 1999.
	   Aware of the issue since 1996, THAI has already sorted out half
of the potential complications and expects to have all the critical
areas under control by the end of this year, according to
Information Technology Services Group director Bu-nga Kornvinai.
	   The entire exercise is estimated to cost between Bt200 million
to Bt300 million and take up to 12,000 days. A total of about 137
software applications are involved throughout the airline, all of
which have to be identified, investigated, fixed and tested in a
careful, methodical manner that does not disrupt the day-to-day
work.
	   ''This has been a top priority project for the last many
months,'' said Kornvinai. ''We have to work with not only our
internal system department but also THAI overseas offices,
technology suppliers, as well as the Airports Authority of
Thailand, the Department of Aviation and Aerothai, to make sure we
are all doing the right thing.'' ''Everything has to be very
carefully coordinated, planned and implemented. We are ensuring
that everything we do is in line with the standard methodology and
compliance being practised by the International Civil Aviation
Organisation, International Air Transport Association, our Star
Alliance partners and airports worldwide.'' The main priority areas
are safety and maintenance of aircraft and spare parts, and the
computer reservation system which has to be error-free in order to
ensure that people, as of Jan 1, 1999, can reserve flights in the
year 2000.
	   ''The degree of computerisation in an airline is unimaginable,''
she said. ''Everything from crew management systems to flight
simulators and ticket issuance to planning of in-flight meals is
all computerised. Cargo and baggage movements would never work
without computers.'' In tacking the problem, THAI's 340-strong
information technology staff worked closely with a specially set-up
Corporate Y2K committee comprising of representatives from all the
airline's various departments.
	   The committee first conducted a company-wide survey to determine
the differences between various systems. Individual solutions then
had to be planned for each different piece of software which
includes not only external applications but also embedded
technology -- microchips that send instructions to whatever
equipment they are in, among others.
	   The fact that the global aviation industry is involved in
solving the problems has proved to be helpful.
	   Two weeks ago, Kornvinai attended a major aviation conference in
Dubai where a number of airlines outlined their plans and projects.
	   ''This is a common, shared issue,'' she said. ''THAI is also
represented on many of these global committees set up to tackle the
problems.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - There is a need to streamline management
policies and legislation for wildlife parks to ensure conservation
efforts are effective, Science, Technology and Environment Minister
Datuk Law Hieng Ding said today.
	   He has asked the Wildlife and National Parks Department to call
for a meeting with the State authorities on the matter. Most parks
come under State jurisdiction and each has differing policies and
legislation.
	   A streamlined and integrated management policy will go a long
way in conservation efforts because any activity in one State can
affect wildlife sanctuaries in another.
	   Law said in Peninsular Malaysia, the National parks were managed
by the Wildlife and National Parks Department whereas State parks
were under State jurisdiction.
	   For Sabah and Sarawak, all wildlife sanctuaries were managed by
the States.
	   ``There is room for improvement where management aspect is
concerned,''
	   Law said when commenting on an article about rhinoceros
conservation in yesterday's New Straits Times' Life &AMP; Times
section.
	   According to the article, the rhinoceros conservation programmes
is affected by lack of funds due to a budget cut arising from the
economic problem.
	   Department sources revealed that the Endau-Rompin rhinoceros
population population is down to fewer than five from 20 to 25 five
years ago.
	   Law has also been urging State Governments to set up more
wildlife sanctuaries, be it State or National park, as a long-term
wildlife protection measure.
	   ``I have also urged them to carry out more research on species
and carry out more educational programmes to create awareness,'' he
said.
	   On weather forecasts, Law said the dry spell that traditionally
begins in June to September had already arrived.
	   He said there had been no information on whether the La Nina
weather phenomenon would happen. However, the El Nino is showing
signs of tapering off.
	   ``Even the World Meteorological Services Department cannot give
any precise weather prediction.
	   ``If La Nina occurs, we will get rain which is good in a way.
There will be less open burning and no haze,'' he added.
	   Asked if the Government was prepared for any eventuality if La
Nina wreaks havoc, he said the National Security Division was on
standby.
	   On air quality, Law said the situation has been generally good.
The highest air pollutant index reading was Nilai with 100. Most
areas recorded good readings.
	   He said the latest report from the Singapore-based Asean
Specialised Meteorological Centre implied that the whole region was
generally free from haze.

<TEXT>
	   WILLEMSTAD, Curacao (AP) _ The new prime minister of the
Netherlands Antilles said larger countries should do more to patrol
Caribbean waters so her islands can spend scarce resources to
control crime on land.
	   In comments this week after being sworn into office, Prime
Minister Suzy Camelia-Romer said the five islands of the
Netherlands Antilles cannot afford the expense of an extensive
coast guard.
	   ``We are just five small islands with no more than 200,000
persons living on them,'' said Camelia-Romer. ``How can the United
States, Britain, France and Holland expect us to invest millions of
dollars in our Coast Guard while criminality on our islands is on
the rise?''
	   She said those major countries should bear more of the burden of
patrolling the waters around the Netherlands Antilles, which
consists of the islands of Curacao and Bonaire, just off the coast
of South America, and St. Maarten, St. Eustatious and Saba in the
eastern Caribbean.
	   The Netherlands Antillean Coast Guard was established in 1996
with the cooperation of Aruba and the Netherlands. The Caribbean
islands, including Aruba, contribute about 24 million guilders
(dlrs 14 million U.S.) a year and the Netherlands contributes about
half that amount.
	   ``We need the money for other important matters,'' said
Camelia-Romer. ``We need more patrol cars and teachers.''
	   She said the United States and the European countries have a
moral responsibility to help.
	   ``The islands are being used as a transshipment point for drugs
for Europe and the United States,'' she said. ``We are being
used.''

	   GOLDMAN Sachs &AMP; Co has a message for Asian companies hoping to
sell stocks over the next few months: It's going to be a cold
summer. ''It would be very risky to venture out in the next few
months,'' according to Steven Wisch, managing director of equity
capital markets at Goldman in Hong Kong.
	   ''The supply of equity (potentially on offer) is enormous, both
from governments and companies. The problem is the buyers.
	   ''It's just a very bad environment. In the past couple of weeks,
I think it has taken a dramatic turn for the worse,'' Wisch told a
small group of reporters Wednesday in Hong Kong.
	   He said that going forward, all but the top Asian companies will
find their share offerings shunned by the market unless the stock
carries a very low price. ''It's going to be very difficult for any
company to come to the equity markets through at least August,''
Wisch said.
	   Wisch made his comments over Asian companies' offerings after
the conclusion of a global sale of 32.5 million shares in
Thailand's PTT Exploration &AMP; Production Plc. Goldman was a co-lead
manager on the deal along with Credit Suisse First Boston Corp and
Lehman Brothers Inc. Wisch called PTTEP ''one of the best companies
in Asia'' and said it had ''a very successful offering amidst a
very turbulent market''. Wisch told The Nation that PTTEP, as a
world-class company, is only one of few companies which could
succeed in selling shares amid the turbulent market in Asia.
Setting the share price at Bt300 apiece to raise Bt9.75 billion,
PTTEP has received interest from numerous international investors,
especially in the United States and Europe.
	   Goldman Sachs is a PTTEP adviser and underwriter.
	   The equity was sold by the Petroleum Authority of Thailand, the
government agency that controls the oil and gas company. The
authority has a ''greenshoe'' option to sell about 4.9 million
additional shares at the same price and its stake would fall to 61
per cent from about 62 per cent now. The shares closed Wednesday on
the Stock Exchange of Thailand at Bt306.
	   Wisch defended the decision to go to the market and offer the
shares, despite his views about where Asian stock markets are
heading and the turbulence that was apparent during the PTTEP
offering. The pre-offering period began in late April, before
worries about the baht were revived and before the late May
downfall of President Suharto in Indonesia. ''This was clearly the
worst possible conditions you could possibly imagine for an equity
offering,'' he said. Yet with the outlook getting worse as the
offering plans went forward, ''it's probably not a bad thing to do
-- to sell if you expect the conditions to continue
deteriorating,'' Wisch added. Wisch said PTTEP was fully aware of
market conditions but needs the money for a US$1.8 billion
investment programme that it has planned. Most of all, the
authority shared Goldman's view that conditions would worsen in
coming months for equity issuers.
	   Wisch said there was widespread demand for the PTTEP stock from
around the world, but noted that the only foreign investors now
interested in Asian equities tend to be those kinds of funds that
''must'' be invested in the region, such as country-specific funds.
Investors buying PTTEP are in for the longer-term, said Wisch. They
were probably attracted to such things as its high capitalisation
on the stock market, plus the facts that its revenue is in dollars,
while its expenses are mostly in baht. He said they also liked the
fact that the company is valued at a level twice the average for
comparable companies around the world, around 9.2 times its
anticipated cash-flow in 2000, when Goldman calculates the past
years' investments will start providing dividends to the company.
Although the markets for equity will be very difficult over the
coming months, the Goldman official said he remains very optimistic
about the business. Goldman has around 10 investment bankers on its
regional equity capital markets team and ''we are in a hiring mode,
not a laying-off mode'', he said. ''There are tremendous needs for
cash and creativity,'' said Wisch. ''The need for investment
banking is probably greater than ever. Companies truly have
problems and they need advice.'' The Nation, Dow Jones

	   KUCHING, Wed. - The State Government is looking for suitable
sites to build settlements for workers employed in the
manufacturing and construction sectors to overcome squatter
problems in towns.
	   Assistant Minister of Planning and Resources Management Awang
Tengah Ali Hasan said today that the Government had directed the
Land Custody and Development Authority to identify sites for the
purpose.
	   Speaking after handing over temporary occupation licences to 29
squatters from Attapah area, he said the settlements would have
basic amenities like electricity and water.
	   ``We have found that these workers, who are from the rural
areas, make up a sizeable number of squatters in towns like
Kuching, Sibu, Bintulu and Miri.
	   ``Hopefully, such a scheme will help the Government arrest the
squatter problem,'' he said, adding that the settlements would be
solely for workers who intended to stay temporarily in the urban
areas before returning to their villages.
	   The other measures which the Government had implemented were the
introduction of resettlement schemes for TOL holders, building more
low- and medium low-cost houses in the urban areas for the
squatters and lower- income groups, and strict monitoring and law
enforcement by the Land and Survey Department, he said.
	   Earlier, Awang Tengah warned TOL holders to build their houses
within two years on being given the lots by the Government.
	   He said the Land and Survey Department will withdraw TOL from
holders who failed to build their houses within the stipulated
period.
	   Those who received their TOLs today will be resettled at the the
Stampin resettlement scheme.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Brutalized but determined to end decades
of oppression, Nigeria's opposition defiantly planned mass
demonstrations for Friday, handing the country's new military ruler
his first major challenge.
	   Critics at home and abroad were watching to see whether Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar would show uncommon tolerance _ or crush his
opponents in the tradition of his heavy-handed predecessor, the
late Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   Local military chiefs in the commercial capital of Lagos, where
the biggest of the protests was planned, hinted Thursday they would
use force if pro-democracy activists push forward to rally the
masses.
	   Lagos military administrator Col. Mohammed Marwa refused to
grant demonstration permits Thursday and ominously warned
government opponents to ``avoid any situation that would invite the
use of force.''
	   ``Such demonstrations are unnecessary at this point in time,''
he said. ``This is a time for prayers.''
	   The protests originally aimed to mark five years since the
annulment of June 12, 1993, presidential elections which would have
ended military rule. However, the demonstration call has taken on
added significance, coming just three days after Abubakar became
this West African nation's latest military ruler.
	   The opposition also urged a nationwide strike, but recent calls
for walkouts have mostly gone ignored and support for this one
seemed lukewarm at best.
	   Abubakar has deeply angered opposition groups by offering only a
vague pledge to move forward with Abacha's flawed democratic reform
program.
	   ``Abubakar is becoming the reincarnation of Abacha,'' said Gani
Fawehinmi, a Lagos attorney and one of the country's best-known
opposition activists.
	   Abacha promised to hand power over to civilians, but then
manipulated the process to become the only candidate for president.
His military regime vetted all political parties and reserved the
right to disqualify candidates in legislative and gubernatorial
polls.
	   Abubakar has said nothing that distinguishes his pledge to
continue the government transition process from that of Abacha, who
died of a heart attack Monday.
	   Moreover, Abubakar _ within hours of taking power _ appeared to
be moving swiftly to consolidate power and eliminate potential
rivals. Two members of his inner circle were under house arrest in
the capital of Abuja, two sources told The Associated Press.
	   Government critics who want to push Abubakar and the army out of
power say they will challenge the new leader's mandate in the
courts as well as on the streets by suing to overturn Abubakar's
appointment.
	   Yet there were doubts that an opposition weakened by a
systematic campaign of arrest, torture and imprisonment under
Abacha would be able to organize a sizeable protest. And the labor
unions that organized past strikes are now under government
control.
	   Fear of Nigeria's brutal security forces runs deep: Nearly every
prominent dissident is in jail or exile. So does apathy in a
population accustomed to being ignored and trod upon.
	   ``There's little or nothing the opposition groups can do. They
government has all the power, they have the guns,'' said Amafari
Alfred-Belleh, a cosmetics saleswoman.
	   ``They can round them all up if they want to,'' she said.
	   In an apparent attempt to keep down the number of students from
demonstrating, authorities Thursday closed some technical colleges
and a university in Lagos and all primary and secondary schools in
Lagos and Kwara states.
	   Insisting Friday's planned protests would go forward, Fawehinmi
said opponents of military rule would defy the local authorities.
	   ``We do not need a permit to exercise our fundamental rights,''
he said in an interview Thursday. ``We have a right to demonstrate
peacefully. We have a right to express our own views.''
	   With the economy of Africa's most populous nation in ruins
despite its vast oil reserves, there was much to protest.
	   Little in Nigeria functions these days, from the water supply to
the telephones. The only people who have a comfortable life are
those who can afford to buy generators, truck in their own water
and hire security guards to fend off rampant robbers.

	   THE Board of Investment Wednesday turned down applications for
promotional privileges for a Bt93 billion project by Bangkok
Expressway Plc (BECL) and a Bt3 billion water pipeline project by
East Water Resources Development and Management Plc.
	   PM's Office Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, who oversees the BoI,
said the board chaired by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai did not
grant investment privileges to BECL's project as it was not a new
scheme, just an extension of the second stage expressway project
from Asoke to Srinakharin Road.
	   BECL was awarded a 30-year concession contract to operate the
second stage expressway project by Expressway and Rapid Transit
Authority of Thailand (ETA) in December 1988. The project was later
integrated with the first-stage expressway. Besides the privileges,
BECL also asked the government to raise toll fees in September. In
the first quarter, the company recorded a Bt134 million loss,
having suffered from foreign exchange losses and a higher interest
burden.
	   Abhisit said the board rejected East Water's water pipeline
project as it is a state enterprise with the Provincial Waterworks
Authority as majority shareholder. Moreover, it is a monopoly
operator in the area.
	   Meanwhile, the BoI has extended privileges to three new
industries -- logistics, crops grown by hydroponics and
engines/auto parts repair.
	   BoI secretary general Staporn Kavitanon said logistics is an
efficient system to lower the cost of goods transportation. The
system is popular in the auto, retailing and courier sectors.
	   There is no constraint on foreign shareholding for logistics
companies providing an international service or located in the
industrial promotion Zone 3. The investors will receive maximum
privileges on imported machinery without any condition on location,
while corporate tax privileges will depend on the industrial
promotional zone.
	   The hydroponics system is an advanced plantation technology with
lower production cost and water usage. It will help farmers grow
agricultural products other than seasonal crops.
	   For the engines/auto parts repair business, the investor will
receive privileges on imported machinery without a plant location
requirement, but it must export all products.
	   Staporn said the board also granted privileges to the Bt2.5
billion Polyester products manufacturer of Indo Polyester
(THailand) Co Ltd which will hire 135 workers and is expected to
earn Bt1.13 billion in foreign exchange a year.

	   PETALING Jaya Selatan MP Donald Lim said Jalan Gasing residents
would meet Petaling Jaya Municipal Council officials today to
discuss their unhappiness over the widening of the road.
	   Residents are expected to hear answers to issues raised in a
memorandum sent to the MPPJ recently.
	   ``According to residents, they were not consulted before the
project began. Residents feel that after the road has been widened,
those living in adjacent houses will find it difficult to drive out
of their homes,'' he told the New Straits Times after visiting the
Seri Setia Old Folk's Home in Seri Setia.
	   ``I understand their anger as they were not consulted. According
to MPPJ, the road is too narrow and heavily used. Therefore, there
was a need to widen it.''
	   The council also planned to cover drains along the road to
prevent water from overflowing.
	   The project is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
	   Meanwhile, Lim said Section 5 residents were receiving water
from MPPJ as scheduled.
	   He said the situation has improved since residents protested
against poor water supply last month.
	   He said MPs, NGOs, residents and consumer associations would
meet Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar on June 25 to
discuss problems due to inadequate water supply.
	   ``It is a good thing that the State Government is having the
meeting. It will give an opportunity to NGOs and associations to
present their views.
	   ``The rationing programme is not working. It has never followed
the schedule.
	   ``At this meeting, we hope a new plan will be formulated.''

	   THE International Monetary Fund (IMF) is the main force blocking
the Bank of Thailand from boosting its money supply, a central bank
official said, adding that they fear a relaxed monetary policy
could affect the country's exchange rate and stability of prices.
	   ''Whenever we start reducing interest rates in the repurchase
market, IMF officials call us to say they do not agree with us,''
the source said.
	   The source noted that the IMF has prevented the central bank
from going ahead with an interest rate cut as long as currencies in
Indonesia, South Korea and Japan remain unstable.
	   According to the source, the BOT admitted that the IMF's
requirement over the high interest rate policy in defence of the
baht was too stringent. Although the central bank has been given a
right to renegotiate the terms and conditions of the loan, final
word will come from the IMF board.
	   However, the source said that the central bank has begun
injecting money into the system in order to increase the monetary
base as well as ease liquidity pressure.
	   But the BOT is still facing obstacles, given that the baht
continues to fall further against the US dollar. The Thai currency
Wednesday dropped slightly to Bt43.15 against the greenback,
compared with Bt42.90 at the close of trading on Tuesday.
	   The source said that the central bank plans to consider the
implications of injecting money into the system in late June or
early next month and see whether the market mechanism works out in
an orderly manner.
	   The BOT's tightening monetary policy so far has drawn widespread
criticism from economists, analysts and businessmen who have urged
the government to increase money supply into the system and ease
liquidity problems. The planned issue of Bt50 billion bonds would
also not ease liquidity because the bonds will refinance the
borrowings of the Financial Institutions Development Fund.
	   In doing so, they believe that the expected depreciation of the
baht would help boost exports, seen a the major engine driving the
country's economic growth.
	   The Thai Farmers Research Centre (TFRC) said in its latest
report that the central bank's high interest rate policy has failed
to yield satisfactory results and suggested that the government
move cautiously with the increase in money supply.
	   To bring the liquidity situation under control, the central bank
has various means to inject new money into the system. First, the
injection can be done through the repurchase market. Second, the
BOT is able to make swap contracts in the onshore market by selling
baht in favour of dollars, that means the baht supply in the system
will automatically rise.
	   Third, baht supply will escalate if the government agrees to
post a budget deficit and borrow loans from the central bank. As a
result, new money will be injected into the system when the
government moves ahead with the spending.
	   The main idea for injecting money is to broaden the monetary
base, comprising notes and coins as well as deposits of financial
institutions which are under the management of the central bank.
	   Although many economists and analysts have urged the government
to increase money supply as a way to tackle liquidity problems,
financial authorities have made it clear that they would not do so.
The weak baht and expected inflationary pressure are the two main
concerns for them.
	   The BOT fears that an injection of money will put the baht under
further pressure while financial institutions will fail to service
the real sector. The institutions are then expected to use the new
money to repay their foreign loans, leading to the baht to fall
further against the greenback.
	   The baht's decline is expected to result in more expensive
imported goods, food and consumer products, and inflationary
pressure will return.
	   Some economists said that the inflation rate is still
controllable, if the central bank moves cautiously to increase the
money supply. But the BOT is still adopting a conservative
management style. The inflation rate has averaged 10.5 per cent
this year, on the assumption that the dollar will stay at Bt41.50.
	   The source noted that recapitalisation and loan restructuring of
financial institutions need to be completed as soon as possible.
	   Loan restructuring will automatically help boost the money
supply as the lower number of non-performing loans would encourage
institutions to lend more to the real sector.

Thriller writer Thomas Narcejac dead at 89
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS age in overline. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Thomas Narcejac, a high school teacher who went on
to write more than 40 best-selling thrillers with Pierre Boileau,
was buried Thursday in a private ceremony in Nice.
	   Narcejac died earlier this week after a long illness at the age
of 89.
	   The two were France's most popular detective writers in the
post-war period, and influenced film directors such as Alfred
Hitchcock and Henri-Georges Clouzot.
	   Narcejac's ``La Mort est du voyage'' (Death's On The Trip) won
the prize for France's best adventure novel in 1948.
	   Born Pierre Ayraud in Rochefort-sur-Mer on July 3, 1908,
Narjecac taught philosophy and literature at a high school in
Nantes, and spent his spare time writing mysteries.
	   He published his first manuscript in 1946, almost 12 years after
it was written while he was serving in the French army.
``L'Assassin de Minuit'' (The Midnight Assassin) was an immediate
success and had his readers clamoring for more.
	   But Narcejac was hesitant, reluctant to follow in the footsteps
of Americans Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammet, then creating a
new genre of detective novel.
	   Narcejac went on to write ``Esthetique du Roman Policier,'' his
own treatise on the detective novel, which he saw as following the
style of Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie.
	   His meeting with Boileau came soon after, and the two went on to
publish 43 thrillers, 100 short stories and four plays. Narjecac
was known as the literary master, while Boileau crafted the plot.
	   Among their best-known works was ``Celle qui n'etait plus,''
(The One Who Passed Away), rejected by French editors but finally
published in 1954.
	   Hitchcock wanted to make it into a movie, but Clouzot beat him
to the rights and turned it into ``Les Diaboliques'' starring
Simone Signoret.
	   It was the subject of a recent Hollywood remake starring Sharon
Stone and Isabelle Adjani.
	   There were no details available concerning survivors.

Baggio's redemption thwarts Chile's upset bid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Baggio quote; will be UPDATED with Cameroon-Austria &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Just as Chile appeared destined to pull the first
major upset of France '98, Roberto Baggio was given a chance at
redemption.
	   Baggio, who missed the penalty kick that ended the World Cup
four years ago, this time found the mark in the 84th minute to lift
Italy to a 2-2 draw with the South Americans on Thursday.
	   Baggio, who made all 11 penalty kicks he took in Italian league
play this year and would not have been in starting lineup were it
not for an injury to Alessandro Del Piero, took the penalty after
defender Ronald Fuentes was whistled for a hand ball in the box.
	   ``Certainly I thought of four years ago,'' Baggio said. ``But
then I told myself I was going to put the ball into the net this
time. Luckily I did.''
	   Baggio also assisted on Italy's first goal, scored by Christian
Vieri in the 10th minute.
	   Still, the draw marked another slow start for Italy, which fell
1-0 to Ireland in its opener four years ago before rallying to
become the eventual runner-up to Brazil. Baggio took the final shot
in the penalty shootout against Brazil and missed high.
	   ``What happened four years ago doesn't count right now,'' said
Italy's coach, Cesare Maldini. ``I was pleased with the team's
reaction and its thirst for a goal.''
	   In a game played in intermittent downpours and sunshine in
Bordeaux, Marcelo Salas scored in first-half injury time and in the
49th minute for the Chileans, who have been made it past the first
round only once six previous World Cup appearances _ and that was
when they hosted the tournament in 1962.
	   Salas, who will join Italy's Lazio next season in a dlrs 20
million transfer, scored 11 goals in qualifying play _ two less
than the entire Italian team.
	   Later Thursday, Cameroon and Austria played in another Group B
match in Toulouse. Three games are set for Friday: South
Arabia-Denmark in Lens, France-South Africa in Marseille and
Paraguay-Bulgaria in Montpellier.
	   Japan, in the World Cup for the first time, doesn't open play
until Sunday against Argentina, but that's too soon for many
Japanese fans who bought tickets that have failed to materialize.
	   While five Japanese travel agencies reportedly were deciding to
cancel World Cup tours because some 12,000 tickets haven't turned
up, a group of 76 fans already at the team's training camp at
Aix-en-Provence waited to find out if even that much-smaller number
could be met.
	   ``I'm trying to be optimistic,'' said Masami Tachi, a
34-year-old housewife from Tokyo. ``But if we don't get tickets
soon, we're going to take the tour coordinator hostage. We will not
kill him.''
	   At other training camps, injuries were the main concern.
	   Germany lost defensive midfielder Steffen Freund for at least 10
days with a pulled a muscle in his right calf. He'll likely miss
two games.
	   Forward Nwankwo Kanu practiced with Nigeria for the first time
since the Olympic champions arrived in France, although another
striker, Daniel Amokachi, sat out with a twisted right knee.
	   Meanwhile, the Netherlands became the last of the 32 teams to
arrive in France, taking up residence in Versailles ahead of
Saturday's match against rival Belgium.
	   Injured Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp went through a full _
though not very strenuous _ training session and emerged smiling
and unharmed.
	   ``It is going very well at the moment,'' said Bergkamp, who hurt
his hamstring six weeks ago. ``I do not feel any pain any more.''
	   Spying also became an issue Thursday, with Spanish coach Javier
Clemente venting anger after some photographers attempted to enter
a closed practice session.
	   And Croatia was upset when its own spies were sent away from an
open practice held by Jamaica, its first World Cup opponent.
Croatian soccer federation president Branko Miksa said tournament
rules say no one can be barred from an open practice, not even
officials from other teams.
	   ``We don't want to make a big noise about this, but we will send
a protest to FIFA and the organizing committee,'' he said.
	   And, in a court in Paris, a Scottish soccer fan was sentenced to
a two-month suspended sentence for throwing beer cans at a French
policeman after Tuesday night's pre-Cup parade.
	   Christopher Kyles, 23, of Aberdeen, apologized to the court,
admitted being drunk and said he remembered none of his actions.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - The High Court today ordered a company and
three others to stop manufacturing an anti-theft car gadget on
grounds that they were not its copyright owners.
	   Judge Datuk R.K. Nathan said the copyright in the form of all
information and trade secrets of the device belonged to Australian
companies, Electro Cad Australia Pty Ltd and Stopcard Pty Ltd
(Australia).
	   In making the order, he directed Mejati RCS Sdn Bhd, Lai Kar
Fatt, V- Kool (M) Sdn Bhd and Central Monitoring System Sdn Bhd to
stop manufacturing, distributing or selling their gadget under the
brand name ``Stopcar''.
	   He held that the gadget possessed features identical to that
manufactured by the Australians under the name ``Stopcard''.
	   The plaintiffs had claimed that the defendants were producing
the device based on information and trade secrets obtained from
them.
	   The device enables the owner of a car to stop the engine of his
car by just dialing a number in his telephone and another procedure
is needed to re-start the car.
	   The Australians said their device, Stopcard Auto Theft Device
(Stopcard) and the Malaysian-made ``Stopcar'' were identical as
both had the same functions and worked on the same system.
	   Nathan, in allowing a claim by Electro Cad, Stopcard and
Stopcard (M) Sdn Bhd, also stopped the defendants from passing off
``Stopcar'' as the product of the plaintiffs and from divulging or
using any information obtained from the plaintiffs.

	   RELA has been urged to establish more units in new housing
estates to help improve security for residents.
	   Balakong State Assemblyman Hoh Hee Lee said the organisation
could complement efforts by police which was facing a shortage of
staff.
	   He said Rela members could help curb crime and other social
problems by getting more local residents to join the organisation.
	   He was speaking to 150 Rela members, include 10 women, who
participated in the annual Hulu Langat District Rela shooting
competition at the Kajang Shooting Club practice ground in Sungai
Jeluh, Kajang recently.
	   Hoh said the housing estates in his constituency like Taming
Jaya, Sungai Ramal Long House needed Rela units to help reduce
crime.
	   On efforts to improve the Rela image, he said it should organise
more publicity campaigns on its role in society.
	   He praised the district Rela for organising the function and
encouraging an interest in shooting.
	   ``This shooting ground is among the few public shooting centres
owned by a shooting club, therefore more people in the district can
come and learn about shooting.''
	   Hoh also agreed to help the district Rela equip the new Kajang
Rela activity centre in Sungai Chua which is still under
construction.
	   District Rela officer Suprat Karjani, in his welcome speech,
said the 2,000 Rela members in the district also organised
community projects.

	   THREE years ago, when ''indie'' and ''alternative'' were
buzzwords in the music industry, new independent record labels were
springing up nearly every month. This proliferation saw the
establishment of such entities as Bakery Music, Gecco Music, Arpho
Indie Records, Eminer, Stone and Oh My God, to name a few.
	   But the country's economic downturn has affected every business
and the music industry is no exception. Even big companies like
Grammy Entertainment and RS Promotion are now encountering
decreased sales.
	   The fallout was swift. Owners of small music companies simply
closed their doors and walked away; it was economically impossible
to continue. There was no money to promote artists, and there was a
dwindling public to either buy their songs or hear them being sung.
	   However, there are always those who refuse to give up, who seek
out ways and means to survive -- and this is all very admirable --
but how?
	   Well, unity helps, and from the economic wreckage there emerged
a group of remaining indie labels who soon realised that standing
together was infinitely better that standing alone.
	   As a result, a project called ''Kaja: House of Indies'' was
recently set up by Varavuthi Bulakul, managing director of Montra
Entertainment.
	   Varavuthi, better known as ''Pe'', said that this cooperative is
aiming to be a medium for both collecting information and managing
the many co-activities of the different labels.
	   The founding members are: Neo Music Network, Stone
Entertainment, Be OK, Ad' Lips, Rong Siang Lumyai, Philharmonic,
Oh! My God and Music Bug.
	   Interestingly, Kaja has also caught the attention of some of the
larger companies and now both Sony Music and Neo Music have joined
the project.
	   By coming together, the project will not only boost the labels'
bargaining power but will also help cut costs.
	   The group has its headquarters at the Kaja Pub and Restaurant,
which is located in the Manohra Hotel on Surawongse Road. Live
concerts and assorted goings-on are held there every Friday and
Saturday from 6 pm.
	   ''We didn't need a big budget to make this project come together
because everyone got involved,'' says Pe, who was happy to admit
that the inspiration for the House of Indie was born out of
necessity.
	   ''Recently, I started my own record company, Ad' Lips and I went
to visit the other indie labels for advice,'' he says. ''As a
result, I found they were all facing similar problems: the high
costs of promotional campaigns and organising concerts. That's when
I realised that it would be better to combine all the small groups
into bigger and stronger one.
	   ''As I have previous experience in management, I thought I would
devote my time to helping the smaller companies.'' So would
combining these smaller companies be a threat to the big boys?
	   ''No way,'' he insists, ''the House of Indies has absolutely no
intention in competing or fighting with Grammy or RS Promotion. We
simply want to survive.'' To increase their chances, the House of
Indies is opening its arms to any record company which would care
to join them.
	   ''There are no rules, and no money is required to join our
'house,' '' said Pe. ''If you are an independent recording company,
don't miss this the chance. This project is to preserve our
species,'' he emphasised.
	   These endangered species include such artists as Smith and
Shane, The Back Up, XL Step, Until, Big Ass, and La Oon.
	   Plans are still on the drawing board for future albums, but with
so many artists now involved, music lovers can look forward to an
array of styles.
	   Which is good news for the consumer.

	   WHAT do ducks have in common with rock? Not a lot, says newcomer
Niwat Yuenyong with a grin. Music Trains's Niwat is currently
making his mark on the music scene with two cuts -- ''Khang
Thanon'' and ''Saan Fun'' off his debut album with the unusual
title of Rock Ped Ped (Rock Duck Duck).
	   ''As this is my first outing, I wanted a name [for the album]
that would reflect my inexperience. A baby duck can't fly or swim,
so I thought it was an appropriate and amusing analogy,'' explains
Niwat, aka Suea Tia.
	   Touch Cyclone, Touch Na Takuathung's second outing not only
offers some of the best dance sounds around, but also some strong
lyrics on upbeat track ''Yaa Dee Tae Phood''.
	   Perhaps because of his own experiences -- he was charged with
possession of a small amount of marijuana last year -- Touch warns
of the dangers of believing everything you hear.
	   Says Touch: ''The lyrics are based on people who like to gossip,
the kind who repeat what they've been told and embellish the story
until it is blown out of all proportion. 'Yaa Dee..' is about a
girl who accuses her lover of flirting with other women. The poor
guy ends up being branded as someone not to be trusted. It would be
a better world if only people stopped to think for a moment before
speaking.'' There's nothing new about picking popular tracks from a
string of albums, bringing the artist back into the studio for a
re-recording session, and then releasing a compilation. It's a
tactic that's often used by the music industry as a quick-sell
filler for a demanding market. Why else would we have record store
shelves stacked with ''Best Of'' tapes and CDs? But sometimes it's
the singer who does the suggesting. Grammy Grand's Sakda Pathasima
is a case in point. He's been wanting to release a full-length
offering of his personal favourites for quite a while.
	   The result is For The Road? and Sakda says he more than
satisfied with the album.
	   ''Although many of the songs are the ones I like best, I think
they will also appeal to listeners. [Producer] Somchai Khamlertkul
helped me a lot in the selection process, choosing those he felt
would bring memories flooding back,'' says Sakda.
	   game One of Thailand's favourite comics, Thep Phoe-Ngam who has
just released a new album Nee Lae Phom under his ''vocalist''
pseudonym Thep Por Por, sets listeners a challenge. To enter Thep's
game, all you have to do is count up the number of times the word
phom pops up in the title track.
	   Answers should be send on a postcard to Thep Por Por, 151
Sukhumvit Soi 62/1, Bangchak, Phra Khanong, Bangkok 10250 before
June 30. The first 100 winners will receive a special prize.
	   concert round-up: - Music Train's Prakasit, Phisan, Vasu, Suthee
and Suea Tia are promoting their new compilation album Sieng Phriek
Haeng Cheewit 4 with a pub tour. You can catch the gang at Por
Koong Phao (Rattanathibet) tomorrow, at Por Koong Phao (Laksi) on
Saturday, or at Por Koong Phao (Phra Padaeng) on Sunday. -
Philharmonic joins up with Tero Records, Green Planet and Sony
Music for a campus tour featuring Ram-Jitti, Hyper and Yae and
Bomb. The bands will appear at King Mongkut Institute of
Technology, North Bangkok on June 19; at Thammasat University
Rangsit on June 21; at Rajabhat Institute of Dusit on June 24; and
at Kasetsart University on July 1.
	   - Mr Why? performs ''Thammai'' and Hyper covers their hit,
''Khwak Naam'' this Friday at Imagine (Siam Square). Show time is 5
pm.
	   - As part of the campaign against teen drug abuse and gambling,
RS Promotion is organising a free concert ''Palang See Khao (White
Power)'' on June 20 at MCC Hall, The Mall Bang Kapi. Taking to the
stage are Raptor, Mo Mae, Raffy-Nancy, Touch Na Takuathung, Sornram
Theppithak, and Edd-Mart. Show time is 1 pm and the complimentary
tickets are available from Star City (Seacon Square and Major
Cineplex Pinklao).
	   music video - Rong Bom Dontri's release ''Nam Jai Look Jang'' by
Billy Ogan. Location: An abandoned factory behind Charoenkrung
Pracharak Hospital. Comedian, Mom Jokmok, (who gets a mention in
the lyrics) is joined by 10 unknowns -- all of whom have been
laid-off over the last few months. The message is ''unity is
essential during the economic crisis''.
	   - ''Chai Loei (Oh Yes)'' on RS Promotion: Locations: A warehouse
in Bang Na done up to resemble a disco and the RS Studio. Joni and
Louis of Raptor try their best to catch the attention of two young
(and gorgeous) Thai-French actresses, Magarie and Jessica. The best
segment is where Joni leaps on to one of the tables and does a neat
dance routine.
	   new release: - Neo Dance, a greatest hits compilation from the
Neo Music Network stable offers The Backup's ''Pan Pueng'', Tic Tac
Toe's ''Say Good Bye'', Smith-Shane's ''Phroh Phook Phan'', Nong
Tom's ''Khor Thod Thee'', and First Formula's ''Mong Arai Kan
Khrab''.
	   - Riding high on the wave of his smash hit ''Rak Nong Phorn'',
look thung singer Sodsai Rungphoethong comes out with a brand new
album on the RS Promotion label. The new offering is called Khong
Faak Jaak Kor Thor Mor and features such music maestros as Kietti

	   FUJITSU PC (Asia) Pte Ltd, a regional division of top Japanese
computer company Fujitsu Corporation, hopes to turn the Asian
economic problems to its advantage by grabbing market share from
less competitive personal computer manufacturers.
	   Along the lines of this renewed aggressiveness is its two-year
goal to become among the top five PC suppliers in Malaysia, a
market which contributes between 22 and 25 per cent to its sales in
the region.
	   Fujitsu Asia has set a modest target of 20,000 PCs for Malaysia
for the next nine months and intends to more-than-double its local
market share in two years.
	   Fujitsu Asia president and chief executive officer Masayuki
Tomimuro said this in Shah Alam yesterday after launching the new
range of Fujitsu Deskpower and Lifebook PC model series.
	   Formerly known as Fujitsu ICL Trading Asia Pte Ltd, the company
intends to leverage on the global business of its parent company
and to build up its brand in the region.
	   ``Our PC outlook in the region remains optimistic for our
growth. We too intend to take market share from the less
competitive in this business.
	   ``We feel that whilst we are aggressively positioning ourselves
during these difficult times, we will be well positioned to
increase market share and business growth,'' Tomimuro said.
	   Currently Asia PC sales represent less than five per cent of
Fujitsu Corporation's worldwide revenue which reached US$37 billion
(RM148 billion) last year, he said.
	   Fujitsu Corporation and other PC suppliers have been charting
negative Asia sales growth during the current economic problems but
are confident that sales in the region will pick up in two years,
he added.
	   When sales pick up in Malaysia, Fujitsu Corporation may consider
setting up full PC manufacturing facilities in the country to
complement its semiconductor and PC components manufacturing
facilities.
	   Fujitsu Asia (Malaysia Branch) managing director Yap Meow Siew
said the company hopes to increase its local market share to five
per cent in two years.

	   SUNGAI PETANI, Wed. - This year's joint military exercise
between Malaysian and Thai armed forces, codenamed Thamal, has been
cancelled due to the current economic downturn, Army Field
Commander Lt Jen Datuk Abdul Aziz Hassan said today.
	   The decision was agreed on at the 70th Regional Border
Committee, held at the Cinta Sayang Golf And Country Club today.
	   The meeting had also agreed to postpone indefinitely future
military exercises involving both countries.
	   ``We had to review our various tasks to save costs due to the
economic slowdown affecting both Malaysia and Thailand,'' said
Abdul Aziz.
	   Abdul Aziz, who headed the Malaysian delegation, was speaking at
a Press conference after the meeting.
	   The Thai delegation was led by the Royal Thai Army's Fourth Area
Commander Lt General Preecha Suwonasri.
	   The last Thamal exercise, involving the armies of both
countries, was held last year while the navies held two exercises
last year.
	   The Malaysian and Thai air forces were expected to participate
in this year's Thamal exercise.
	   Despite the cancellation of the exercises, Abdul Aziz said the
meeting generally agreed that the economic climate should not
affect the armed forces' efficiency, especially in addressing the
influx of illegal immigrants.
	   He said both Malaysia and Thailand acknowledged the need for
full co- operation to curb the transgression by illegals through
the countries' common border.
	   ``To date, both countries have co-operated very well to tackle
this problem,'' he said.

	   THE United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will
be allowed to participate in the administration of all 12 border
camps for displaced Burmese as a ''co-partner'', a senior
government source said yesterday.
	   However, because of the UNHCR's shortage of staff, it will adopt
a rotation monitoring team so they can effectively provide
assistance for the Burmese, the source said.
	   A proposal detailing the role of the UN agency in the camps has
been drafted by Thai authorities and the UNHCR and submitted to the
National Security Council for final endorsement.
	   The NSC is expected to approve the proposal soon, the source
said.
	   ''The UNHCR will work as a co-partner with Thai authorities from
the beginning, starting with deciding whether the Burmese should be
received into the camps, screening them to determine their status
and registering them,'' the source said.
	   ''Importantly, the UNHCR will cooperate with Thai authorities in
deciding whether to repatriate the Burmese. The agency and Thailand
will decide whether it is timely to send them back, but
repatriation will not be against the will of the Burmese. The joint
mission will also determine whether the areas where the Burmese
will be repatriated are safe,'' the source said.
	   Thailand changed its policy stance earlier this year when Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai publicly announced that he agreed in
principle to the UNHCR playing a greater role in the camps for
displaced Burmese.
	   Previously, the UN agency was refused any role in the camps. Due
to the international organisation's absence, Thai authorities have
often been criticised for their handling of the camps and for
forcibly repatriating the Burmese.
	   ''Thailand has to accept the UNHCR's role in the camps because
we need financial assistance as the country has suffered from the
economic crisis. We cannot handle it by ourselves,'' the source
said.
	   The proposal under consideration by the NSC does not include the
budget the UNHCR will provide for the camps' administration.
	   At present there are 12 Burmese camps situated in four provinces
-- Tak, Mae Hong Son, Kanchanaburi and Ratchaburi -- housing about
96,000 Burmese. The large number of displaced people has caused
problems for Thailand in terms of national security, public health
and social and economic issues.
	   ''In granting the UNHCR a role in the camps we have to recognise
that all the procedures will require more time as it is different
from in the past when Thailand could run everything in the camps
itself,'' the source said.
	   The source added that the UNHCR will not be authorised to
provide security for the camps or refugees, leaving those duties to
voluntary forces, border patrol police and soldiers.

	   IPOH, Wed. - The State Umno has appointed Teluk Intan division
chief Che Onn Hamzah and Sungai Siput division head Datuk Mohd
Padil Harun to debate on the resolutions at the party general
assembly in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Its chief Tan Sri Ramli Ngah Talib said Che Onn would represent
the State Umno in debating the resolution on the economy while Mohd
Padil would speak during the debate on the presidential address.
	   This was decided at the committee meeting at his residence this
afternoon. The three-day assembly starts on June 19.
	   The Menteri Besar also said in view of the prolonged economic
problems, the committee felt it should explain the situation to the
grassroots.
	   This was necessary to prevent them from being influenced by
undesirable elements out to confuse the people.
	   The party Information Committee had been entrusted with the
responsibility of explaining the matter to the people.

	   ZECON Engineering Berhad is expected to cushion the impact of
the present economic difficulties by depending on its ``wide base
and steady stream of customers''.
	   Executive chairman Zainal Abidin Ahmad said: ``The fact that we
are specialists and market leaders in the sub-sectors of foundation
and piling works, mechanical and electrical engineering as well as
in geo-technical works ensure that we have a wide base and steady
stream of customers.''
	   He added that it also helped that during the good years, Zecon
had restrained itself from diversifying aggressively.
	   ``We do not have the difficult task of down-sizing or
retrenching like other companies,'' he said after Zecon's annual
meeting in Kuching, Sarawak.
	   On the company's outlook for the current year, Zainal said Zecon
expected a slight dip in its profits in view of the current
economic situation but expressed optimism that the ``picture will
be much brighter by 1999''.
	   Zainal said the company had always been a prudent player and
this had been proven wise in this difficult times.
	   ``We have always kept a good eye on productivity and operational
efficiency and the figures (for 1997) show that we are on the right
track.''
	   Zecon managed to record positive growth for the year ended Dec
31, 1997 even though group turnover dipped slightly from RM103.49
million in 1996 to RM100.24 million last year.
	   Zecon, which is listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's
second board, recorded a group pre-tax profit of RM9.95 million
last year which was RM1.70 million or 16.8 per cent better than the
pre-tax profit recorded in 1996.
	   In future, Zecon plans to make inroads into property
development.

Eritrea urges council action to stop Ethiopian attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Eritrea called Thursday for the Security
Council to do everything in its power to stop the border clashes
with Ethiopia.
	   In a letter to the council president, the Eritrean U.N.
ambassador, Haile Menkerios, accused Ethiopia of threatening to
strike boats in its ports and planes in its airspace.
	   ``This irresponsible act is not only intended to cut off
commercial air and sea traffic to Eritrea, but is also a direct
threat to the freedom and safety of international commercial
traffic,'' he wrote.
	   The two Horn of Africa nations, which less than a decade ago
were part of the same country, are battling over several stretches
of border land. The fighting that erupted May 6 prompted an array
of mediation attempts.
	   ``We call upon the council to condemn and do everything in its
power to stop it in time,'' the ambassador wrote.

	   ALOR STAR, Wed. - Private colleges should offer students courses
and training in areas relevant to the country's needs at affordable
prices.
	   State Human Resources and Entrepreneur Development Committee
chairman Abdullah Hasnan Kamruddin said if fees were too high, many
local students would be deprived of the opportunity to pursue
tertiary education at these colleges.
	   He also urged private colleges to offer courses and training
that would help fulfil the country's human resources requirements.
	   ``At this time of economic difficulty, the colleges must offer
as much as they can at a cost affordable to the majority of
students,'' he said.
	   ``They should also ensure their graduates possess the knowledge
and ability to contribute to national development.''
	   He said this after witnessing the signing of a memorandum of
understanding between Institute Petua and Edith Cowan University of
Perth, and Jewels and Esk Valley College of Scotland yesterday to
establish a twinning programme between the institutions.
	   Institute Petua chairman Izhar Ismail signed on behalf of the
institute while ECU vice-chancellor Professor Millicent Poole and
the principal of Jewels and Esk Valley College John Lisgo signed
for their respective institutions.
	   Izhar said Institute Petua would initially offer a one-year
foundation course to students that would prepare them for a degree
at ECU.
	   He also said the institute would move to its new RM35 million
campus when it is ready in the middle of next year.

	   SIAM Commercial Bank Wednesday said it is not a major creditor
of Somprasong Land Plc, which has unpaid bonds of US$80 million and
a clean loan worth Bt3.57 billion.
	   The bank said it lent less than Bt200 million, or around 2 per
cent of the debts, and the loan is secured.
	   Moreover, the bank said, it has set up SCB Resolution Corp Ltd
to rehabilitate property projects with an integrated management
system so that the property industry can survive in the long run.
This policy will also enable the property industry to improve the
national stability.
	   Debt restructuring bogged down THE executive vice president of
Siam Cement Plc and president of the Federation of Thai Industries,
Tawee Butsunthorn, said the central Bank of Thailand has not yet
completed the time-table for the corporate debt restructuring
process.
	   Moreover, it is unclear who will provide the asset appraisal.
Debtors fear that the appraisal value could be lower than the
market value, which would mean they must pay more money to their
creditors. They said the government should find a middleman who
will ensure fairness for the debtors.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said there should be
a variety of appraisers to ensure fair practice.
	   The Thai Bankers' Association held a meeting Wednesday to
discuss the restructuring measures.
	   Banpu secures funding for power generation project BANPU Plc is
expected to sign a US$300 million loan package with 10 financial
institutions within the next two weeks for financing its IPP power
plant project under a joint venture with Tri Energy Co Ltd.
	   Company president Chanin Vongkusolkit said that there will be an
additional condition in the loan agreement that the package must be
guaranteed by OPIC, a US loan guarantee institute and the Ministry
of International Trade and Industry (MITI) against political risks.
	   This condition could lead to a higher interest burden and a
lower-than-expected internal rate of return (IRR) of 20 per cent
rather than 22 per cent.
	   Tri Energy's major shareholders are Texaco, Mission Energy and
Banpu. The 700-megawatt IPP project in Ratchaburi province is
expected to be completed by the middle of 2000.
	   Mitsubishi's truck exports up Mitsubishi car distributor MMC
Sittipol Co Ltd announced that it had exported a total of 4,749
L200 Estrada trucks worth nearly Bt2 billion last month.
	   Executive vice president Vachara Phanchet said that Europe
remains the largest market importing 80 per cent of exports from
Thailand. Portugal, Spain, Germany, Israel and Cyprus are the
biggest importers.
	   The company began exporting the L200 Estrada in January this
year. It has exported a total of 19,438 units worth Bt8.7 billion
since then. In the first five months of this year, the export of
all kinds of Mitsubishi cars rose by 169 per cent compared with the
same period last year.
	   Bayer joins coating show BAYER will be one of the more than 140
international suppliers to the coating industry participating in
''Asia-Pacific Coating Show 1998'', scheduled for June 24 and 25 at
the Queen Sirikit National Convention Centre.
	   The exhibition, organised by DMG Business Media Ltd, England,
will be showcase the latest raw materials for chemical production
and equipment for the manufacturing paint, printing inks and
adhesives.
	   Bayer plans to display new developments of its core business
including organic and inorganic pigments, coatings and special raw
materials.
	   The organic pigments are important for colour selection. These
innovations can match shades for an excellent choice of colours on
various product lines. Inorganic pigments, including non-fading
pigments, will be presented as a key additive for automotive and
transportation, wood furniture, construction and corrosive
protection industries worldwide.
	   James Kassner from Bayer Corporation in Pittsburgh is scheduled
to deliver a lecture on ''Long-term Trends in High Performance
Pigments'' on June 22 as part of a technical conference organised
by the British-based Paint Research Association.
	   New Nokia base in China FINNISH telecom equipment maker Nokia
will establish a new manufacturing unit in Suzhou Industrial Park,
Jiangsu province, China, in order to produce GSM base stations and
cellular network transmission products. The new, purpose-built
facility, Nokia (Suzhou) Telecommunications Co Ltd, is a
wholly-owned manufacturing site for Nokia in China.
	   Nokia currently has six production sites in China, covering
telecommunication infrastructure and mobile products, as well as
after-sales services. The Suzhou factory will act as one of Nokia's
main manufacturing sites in Asia and will serve countries in the
region. The new factory will commence delivery in 1999 and in its
first phase will provide work for around 300 people by the end of
that year.
	   Nokia offers total GSM systems, with everything from digital
mobile phones to transmission and switching as well as extensive
services for building, efficiently operating and developing these
networks. Having supplied GSM technology to 70 operators in 36

	   HALIM Securities Sdn Bhd's application to strike off a
winding-up petition by Multi Purpose Bank Bhd has been adjourned to
June 16.
	   In the petition filed on March 19, Multi Purpose is seeking to
wind up Halim Securities over its failure to pay loan facilities
amounting to RM15.9 million.
	   Halim Securities, which is already under trading restrictions,
was placed under the direct supervision of the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange from March 23 to prevent payment defaults and other
trading breaches by the stockbroker.
	   Multi Purpose also applied to strike off the validation order
obtained by Halim to pay its normal operating expenses including
salaries and Employees Provident Fund payments on April 29 from the
High Court.
	   Multi Purpose's application on this subject has been scheduled
to be heard today.
	   Following this, Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank sought an order
from the High Court on June 5 to validate the transfer of 40
million shares of Halim securities owned by Uniphoenix Corporation
to its nominee.
	   The Halim shares were pledged by Uniphoenix to Arab-Malaysian as
security for a syndicate loan of RM50 million. This matter is
scheduled to be heard on July 9.
	   Apart from that, Uniphoenix Corporation Bhd's application to
strike off the winding up petition by Multi Purpose Bank has been
postponed to June 22.

	   THE retail price of petrol will Thursday increase by Bt0.30 a
litre because of the continued weakening of the baht, which has
dropped by three units to the dollar since late last week, Metta
Buntuengsuk, deputy secretary-general of the National Energy Policy
Office, said Wednesday.
	   The retail prices for petrol and diesel are estimated to
increase by Bt0.30 per litre as the baht has fallen to 42.5 to the
dollar during the last week.
	   Metta said oil companies, faced with strong competition, had
tried to retain their prices. Some even slashed them.
	   But the effect has been to hinder efforts by the retail petrol
companies to raise their prises, forcing them to shoulder higher
costs from the devaluing baht.
	   Even though approval has been given for a 30 satang rise, some
companies will be lifting their prices by 20 satang only.
	   Metta said the oil price in Singapore is being maintained at
US$19.10 per barrel for premium petrol, and at $17.85 per barrel
for regular petrol.
	   The diesel price is $15.6 per barrel while crude oil is charged
at $12-14 per barrel.
	   The price adjustment by oil firms in Thailand has not been
because of the increase in international prices but due to the
depreciation of the baht.
	   The profit margin of petrol traders in May was as high as Bt1.70
a litre but since the global oil prices were reduced by $2 to $3
per barrel, the price reduction by oil companies was a lot steeper
than a drop in oil prices in the global market. However, the margin
this month is around Bt1.10-1.20 a litre which is lower than the
average level.
	   Petrol prices in Bangkok and its outskirts has been set at
Bt12.51 for octane 95 petrol, Bt11.87 for octane 91 petrol and
Bt8.90 for diesel.

	   K&AMP;N Kenanga Holdings Bhd has formalised its partnership with
Rothschild Asset Management International Holdings BV with the
setting up of a 60:40 joint venture foreign fund management
company.
	   Applications have been made to the Securities Commission for the
necessary approvals, after which the joint venture will offer fund
management services to institutional and retail clients in
Malaysia.
	   The joint venture - Kenanga Investment Management Sdn Bhd - will
also look into the setting up of a unit trust subsidiary, Kenanga
Unit Trust Bhd, to launch a unit trust scheme by the year-end to
invest in Malaysian equities.
	   This joint venture will also provide expertise to another

World Cup: Star says this is the year South Korea makes the second
</HEADLINE>
round &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-QUENTIN, France (AP) _ After four fruitless attempts,
South Korea will finally advance past the first round of the World
Cup this time.
	   That's according to the team's experienced midfielder, Seo
Jung-won.
	   ``This is definitely the year South Korea will qualify for the
second round,'' declared Seo, the first Korean ever to sign with a
French club at the start of the year when he joined Strasburg for
dlrs 1.5 million.
	   ``I think the team has accumulated enough experience and has
progressed enough to win a game, and even advance.
	   ``It is true group E is very difficult but we are very
confident,'' said the 28-year old Seo, in one of the few instances
the South Korean players were allowed to speak with the foreign
press.
	   South Korea believes its best chances lie with a victory over
Mexico, which it will meet in its opening match on Saturday in
Lyon. Should it fail to win, South Korea would then have to post a
victory over a tough Belgian team or soccer-power Netherlands.
	   Even though two of its key players will miss the team's pivotal
first match due to injury, the rest of the squad appeared as
confident as Seo.
	   The team's star striker Hwang Sun-hong, sidelined with a knee
injury since last Thursday, and midfielder Choi Sung-yong who
twisted his ankle in Tuesday's training, were present on the field
but only performing light exercises.
	   ``It is regrettable two players won't be well enough to play,''
said Seo, who played for the team in the 1994 World Cup in the
United States. ``But I don't think it will affect the team in any
major way.''
	   In one of his infrequent interviews with the western press,
coach Cha Bum-kun said after Thursday's practice he was pleased
with his team's progress.
	   ``We are here to win, they are ready to win,'' said Cha, the
former international who led South Korea to the World Cup in Mexico
in 1986.
	   ``The team is at its highest level. Compared to 1994 we have a
lot more young players, who have more zeal even if they may be less
experienced.''
	   Though it is widely expected Netherlands and Belgium will be the
teams to advance out of group E, Cha isn't ready to write off his
team.
	   ``I agree Belgium and Holland may go up,'' said Cha. ``But I
also believe it is possible for South Korea and Mexico to
advance.''

Srebrenica women visit their family graves for the first time

<TEXT>
	   SREBRENICA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ For the first time since
the war ended in Bosnia, Muslim women expelled from Srebrenica
visited their family graves at the site of what is believed to be
the war's worst massacre.
	   Escorted by peacekeepers on Thursday and cordoned-off by Bosnian
Serb police from jeering Serb bystanders on sidewalks, two busloads
of women headed straight for the grave site at Kazan cemetery in
Srebrenica.
	   In 1996, in one of the worst incidents of ethnic cleansing in
the Bosnian war, Bosnian Serb troops overran the Muslim enclave in
eastern Bosnia in the summer of 1996.
	   Some managed to flee, but thousands of Muslim men and boys have
been missing since and are believed to have been massacred by the
Serbs.
	   A crowd of 150 Serbs raised the nationalist Serb three-finger
sign as the Muslim women passed by. One Serb turned a radio
blasting traditional Serb songs to maximum volume.
	   The women spent about two hours tending their family graves
under the protection of Larry Sampler, the international official
named to the top civilian post in Srebrenica by top international
mediator Carlos Westendorp.
	   Sampler was placed in charge following an unsettled dispute on
who should rule the town between the Serb community now living in
Srebrenica and its expelled Muslim population which won the
majority of seats in local elections.
	   Shortly afterward, the women returned to Tuzla in Muslim-Croat
federation territory.
	   Sampler told Associated Press Television the Srebrenica women's
visit to their hometown was ``an act of courage,'' saying they had
organized the journey themselves. He also thanked the Bosnian Serb
police for help in keeping the situation under control.
	   One woman who would only give her first name said it was a
``very difficult day for me.''
	   ``I have lost everything but I understand some of the (Serb)
people here have lost everything, too,'' Fatima said.

	   IPOH, Wed. - Two women, shocked with their excessively high
water bills, took their woes to the State MCA Complaints Bureau as
the last resort.
	   Housewife Foo Kwai Lan, 64, said she was upset after being
notified by the Perak Water Board recently that the water supply to
her house in Pasir Pinji would be disconnected if she did not pay
up her water bill amounting to RM1,613.
	   ``I was shocked when I received the bill for water used between
Dec 3, last year and Feb 5, this year when my previous bills
averaged only RM13 a month.'' She claimed that the Board had turned
a deaf ear to her complaints when she appealed to it to investigate
the matter several months ago.
	   She believes that the problem could have started after the
replacement of an old meter in her house in December.
	   A technician from the Board told her son Ng Kong Chye, that
there was a possibility of leakage in the underground pipe but he
did not carry out any check at her house.
	   Meanwhile, coffee shop operator Teh Lian Peng, 50, who runs a
shop in Jalan Yang Kalsom, said she had been paying her water bills
regularly but recently received a notice asking her to pay a total
of RM1,499.60.
	   She was puzzled as to why she had to pay the amount despite
having settled her bills regularly on time.
	   Following their complaints, the State MCA Complaints Bureau
vice- chairman and city councillor Gooi Seng Teik urged the board
to set up a special unit to investigate such complaints.

	   WITH the deliberate intention of breaking away from the norm, a
group of former students of Convent Bukit Nenas decided to have
their get-together at the Lifestyle Karaoke Lounge of Holiday Villa
Subang Jaya recently.
	   The Class of '86 students let their hair down and had a whale of
a time at the function.
	   Organising committee chairman Syirin Zarina said it was the
second meeting since the last one held two years ago.
	   ``We have about 120 ex-students from the 1986 batch but we only
managed to get in touch with about 90.
	   ``We felt this number was good enough to call for a party,''
Syirin said.
	   She said the main aim of the get-together was to keep in touch
with each other and to build a business network.
	   ``Our Old Girls are holding high posts in the various business
fraternity and the meeting will offer an excellent opportunity to
meet and discuss possible avenues for business expansion,'' Syirin
said.

	   THE Board of Investment Wednesday announced a plan to allow
foreigners to own up to 100 per cent of office building and
condominium projects whose construction is at least 70 per cent
completed, while pushing for a speedy executive decree to permit
foreign real estate developers operate in the Thai market.
	   BoI secretary-general Staporn Kavitanon said that 100 per cent
foreign ownership in office building and condominium projects,
which meet the qualifying standards, will help ease liquidity in
the real estate sector and the economy.
	   This plan, in which project construction has to be 70 per cent
complete within three months following the BoI announcement, was
approved by the BoI committee, chaired by the prime minister,
Wednesday.
	   Staporn said this measure will revitalise the real estate sector
and attract foreign funds into the country which is facing a huge
over-supply of office and condominium space, especially in the
Bangkok area, because of a sharp slowdown in demand following more
than a decade of over-investment.
	   As of the end of 1997, the BoI estimates that there was an
over-supply from both finished and unfinished projects worth Bt130
billion.
	   Although the condominium law currently permits foreigners to own
up to 40 per cent space, actual foreign ownership is now only 17
per cent of total space. BoI said some foreign investors wanted to
buy whole office buildings or condominiums but could not do so due
to the legal ownership limit.
	   Under the BoI plan, 100 per cent foreign ownership will
encourage foreigners to make their decision. This will especially
benefit projects where construction is at least 70 per cent
complete.
	   In addition, the BoI committee will propose to the Cabinet to
issue an executive decree to permit foreigners and foreign
companies to be real estate investors/developers for both land and
buildings if promoted by the BoI. The BoI expects foreign
investment to follow as a result.
	   Current law still bans foreigners from land ownership and
trading.
	   The BoI will also forward a proposal to the Cabinet to amend the
condominium law to allow 100 per cent foreign ownership.

	   SAPURA Systems (M) Sdn Bhd (SSM), a member of the Sapura Group,
believes it can obtain more revenue contribution from the
information storage market for the coming year. SSM, which is the
local distributor of ATL's digital linear tape (DLT) libraries,
also expects to increase its market share by 100 per cent.
	   SSM's marketing manager Wan Ahmad Kamal said efforts would be
made to raise awareness among corporate users on the importance of
proper information storage within their organisations.
	   The company plans to conduct aggressive indirect marketing
activities through its 35 channel partners nationwide.
	   ``On top of that, we have also directly planned to market these
products by conducting roadshows and other joint events with ATL,''
Wan Ahmad said.
	   SSM, he added, will also leverage on its regional and
local-based advertisements in an effort to increase its revenue in
the information storage market.
	   Wan Ahmad was speaking to reporters at a Press conference held
in Kuala Lumpur last week in conjunction with the launch of ATL's
latest range of information storage products. The products are the
P1000, P3000, PowerStor L500 libraries and the PL50 Library Hub,
which are developed using the Prism architecture.
	   At the same event, ATL's regional general manager for
Asia-Pacific Graham Timm said Prism is a new library architecture
that seeks to shatter the constraints of the conventional approach
to storage performance, and thus redefines the library system
design. By incorporating a cost- effective, high-performance
peripheral component interconnect (PCI) expansion bus into
automated tape systems, the Prism architecture has reached a
pinnacle in open systems design.
	   ``By harnessing the power of high-speed PCI adapter cards, the
Prism libraries can be upgraded by adding library building blocks.
The upgrade enables network and fibre connectivity and provides
capability to embed servers and functionality such as tape
mirroring and auto tape copy,'' Timm said.
	   He added that libraries which utilise the Prism technology are
compatible with all Unix and Windows NT environments.
	   ``Its support of open system storage management provides a high
degree of flexibility and compatibility to the end users in
ensuring that their investments are protected.''
	   The P1000 provides the capability of supporting up to four DLT
4000 or DLT-7000 drives and 30 DLT cartridges for 72 gigabytes (GB)
per hour performance. It also allows cost-effective expansion by
adding only drives and cartridge slots, thus eliminating the need
to buy a new library.
	   Targeted at storage-intensive applications, the P3000 features
up to 16 DLT drives and 332 cartridges for 288GB per hour
performance. The high availability design features hot-swap DLT
drives, power supplies, fans and AC sources.
	   The PowerStor L500 meanwhile is targeted at small to
medium-sized industries (SMIs). It supports up to three DLT drives
and 14 DLT cartridges and delivers 54GB per hour back-up
performance.
	   The PL50 Library Hub presents a virtual library to three
heterogeneous back-up servers by allowing a user to assign a
cartridge slot and drive partitions. It is equipped with four small
computer systems interface (SCSI) ports, a monitor and advanced
library hub software, Timm said.

Guyana says it will ignore pressure to stop hangings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ A London-based human rights group said
Thursday it plans to petition the Guyana government to commute the
death sentences of two prisoners who have been on death row for
more than 10 years.
	   The group, Interrights, said it would lobby President Janet
Jagan in the wake of a recommendation last month by the United
Nations Human Rights Committee that Abdool Yaseen and Noel Thomas
be set free.
	   The two were convicted more than a decade ago for killing
Yaseen's younger brother in a dispute over family assets.
Interrights contends the long time the two have spent on death row
constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and it also questioned
some aspects of their trial.
	   The government has said it will ignore the U.N. rights group's
recommendation and pressure from human rights groups and proceed
with the hangings in the next few weeks.
	   In a meeting of justice ministers from Caribbean countries last
week, several complained that human rights groups were ganging up
on them and pressuring them to halt executions.
	   Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago recently withdrew from
international accords which they said were being abused by
convicted killers to prevent executions. Those two countries, along
with Guyana and the Bahamas, have more than 130 prisoners on death
row.

Nobel laureate Cela's dislike of gay support of Lorca centennial
</HEADLINE>
sparks anger &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spanish literary giant Camilo Jose Cela's
distaste for gay interest in this year's centennial celebrations
for poet and playwright Federico Garcia Lorca were criticized by
politicians and gay activists Thursday.
	   The 81-year-old Nobel laureate said Wednesday that he hoped his
own 100th birthday would be ``free of the support of gay groups.''
He also dismissed homosexuality as ``not a problem that interests
me.''
	   The secretary-general of the main opposition Socialist Party,
Joaquin Almunia, said Cela's remarks were ``disgusting'' and showed
the novelist's ``inability to live in a plural society,'' the
national news agency EFE reported.
	   Lorca was 38 years old, and a major figure in the Spanish
literary vanguard, when he was killed in by Gen. Francisco Franco's
Nationalist troops during the opening days of the Spanish Civil War
in 1936.
	   Lorca was relegated to the cultural shadow's during Franco's
40-year regime that also outcried his homosexuality.
	   The head of the Spanish Gay and Lesbian Federation Pedro Zerolo
dismissed the Cela's remarks as the predictable ruminations of a
reactionary.
	   ``The Nobel Prize for Literature is awarded for literary talent
and not for personal qualities'' he said.
	   Responding to the criticism, Cela apologized for any offense his
remarks had caused but refused to soften them, ``There is no doubt
about what I said'' he told EFE.
	   The 1998 ``Lorca Year'' has prompted a new surge of interest in
Spain's most translated modern poet whose most famous works include
``Gypsy Ballads'' and ``Poet in New York''.

Israeli minister: Jew believed executed by Iranian government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is asking the Red Cross and other
international relief organizations to look into reports that a
member of Iran's Jewish community was executed by the Islamic
government, a senior official said Thursday.
	   Deputy Defense Minister Silvan Shalom said Israel had received
information indicating Ruhollah Kad-Kuhzadeh, 60, was killed
several days ago.
	   He made the announcement in parliament following unconfirmed
media reports that Kad-Kuhzadeh, an active member of Tehran's
Jewish community, was killed for helping Jews leave Iran. The
reports said he disappeared over a month ago, and his family was
informed by authorities last week of his execution.
	   ``The government of Israel is demanding clarification on this
issue, and the Foreign Ministry has been asked to contact the Red
Cross, the United Nations and other international organizations in
a search for information on the fate of Mr. Kad-Kuhzadeh and that
of other Jews held in Iranian custody,'' Shalom said.
	   No official comment from Iran was available.
	   Shalom said the information Israel had received was ``partial
and unconfirmed.'' If the report is confirmed, he said, ``The
Israeli government would view with tremendous gravity the execution
of a person based on their religion.''
	   Some 25,000 Jews live in Iran, which has no relations with the
Jewish state.
	   Human rights groups and Jews inside and outside Iran say Iranian
Jews aren't persecuted for their religion, although they are barred
from holding many government jobs and cannot have any contact with
Jews in Israel.

	   United Development Party (PPP) chairman Ismail Hasan Metareum
brushed aside demands yesterday for him to step down, saying he
would only leave the post at the end of his term.
	   Speaking to reporters an hour after his supporters regained
control over the party's headquarters from a dissenting group which
demanded his resignation, Ismail affirmed his commitment to stay on
as chairman until the end of his term which is signified by the
holding of a party congress.
	   ``I was elected as party chairman during PPP's 1994 congress and
will only return the mandate to party members in the next
congress,'' he said.
	   Ismail, who is better known as Buya, acknowledged that there
were demands to move up the congress, which is currently scheduled
for 1999.
	   ``The decision, whether or not to have the party congress ahead
of schedule, will be made in the upcoming leadership meeting slated
for June 26,'' he said.
	   ``Such an early party congress is needed to anticipate the
government's plans for the next general election,'' he added.
	   President B.J. Habibie said Saturday that the next general
election would be held as early as May next year.
	   Invade
	   Thousands of Ismail's supporters invaded the PPP headquarters on
Jl. Diponegoro, Central Jakarta, at 2 p.m. yesterday and took
control of the party's secretariat within a few minutes.
	   The party headquarters had been ``occupied'' by a group of 300
dissenting party members since Monday.
	   The group, calling itself the PPP Reform Committee, demanded
party leaders hold an extraordinary congress to elect a new
chairman to replace Ismail, no later than June 30. The congress is
currently scheduled for August 1999. The group also asked Ismail to
step down.
	   Ismail dismissed the allegations that the PPP executive board
had failed to satisfy the people's reform movement and maintained
support for then president Soeharto.
	   ``It's not true if people say that PPP had always wanted
Soeharto as president.''
	   ``The PPP faction at the House of Representatives, together with
other factions, formally asked Pak Harto to step down,'' he said.
	   The group had earlier accused Ismail of manipulating the party
into supporting the renomination of Soeharto for president in
March, while ignoring 20 out of 27 provincial councils, which were
against the decision.

Watch has said that Iranian Jewish leaders sometimes play down
instances of mistreatment.
	   Israel fears that Iran is close to developing missiles with
capabilities of striking at Israel and has warned Iran is advancing
its nuclear program.

	   More than 1,500 workers from the metal, electronics, machines
and tourist sectors staged a boisterous demonstration at the
Ministry of Manpower here yesterday, demanding the revocation of
the 1997 labor law and thorough reform of the state-owned insurance
company PT Jamsostek.
	   The workers held a free speech forum as they waved banners
reading: Hentikan Campur-Tangan Militer Dalam Kasus-kasus Pekerja
(Stop Military Interference in Labor Disputes), Cabut Undang-Undang
No. 25/1997 (Revoke Labor Law No. 25/1997) and Usut Korupsi di PT
Jamsostek (Investigate Rampant Corruption at PT Jamsostek).
	   Hikayat Atika Karwa, chairman of the electronic, metal and
machine sector's trade union, said the government should
demonstrate its commitment to total reform by acceding to the
workers' demands.
	   ``The government should pay serious attention to the fate of
hundreds of thousands of fired and laid-off workers. Workers will
also continue to stage protests unless the government improves
their social welfare,'' he said.
	   Atika Karwa said the government should set up an independent
team to handle the problem of laid-off workers.
	   ``The independent team should be able to provide legal
protection for laid-off workers and fight for their rights. It
should also provide training and financial facilities for them to
create jobs or move into other professions.''
	   Ali Samioen, chairman of the tourist sector's trade union, said
the government should review the new labor law and amend chapters
that ignored worker rights.
	   ``The new law must be reviewed if the government wants to see
workers respected. Workers can no longer become subject to
exploitation both by their employers and the government,'' he said.
	   Ali said the government should no longer involve the security
apparatus in labor disputes.
	   ``This is the reform era. Workers are free to unionize and to
air their aspirations. They should no longer be subject to
oppression and exploitation.''
	   He also urged the government to review the social security law,
issued in 1992, and put the state-owned insurance company PT
Jamsostek under the management of a tripartite board of directors.
	   ``Law No. 3/1992 must be reviewed and PT Jamsostek's management
must be reformed. The company's management must represent workers,
employers and the government because the funds managed by the
company come from workers, not from the government,'' he said.
	   He said the Attorney General's Office should also investigate
allegations of rampant corruption in the company, including the use
of Rp 7.1 billion to finance the making of the new labor law and
the construction of two high-rises in the city.
	   Director General of Industrial Relations and Labor Standards
Soufii Samsuddin received the workers' petitions and pledged to
discuss them with Minister of Manpower Fahmi Idris.
	   ``I promise to discuss these petitions with the minister,'' he
said.
	   The minister is currently abroad attending an International
Labor Organization meeting in Geneva.
	   Jamsostek
	   The president of PT Jamsostek, Ackmal Husen, told The Jakarta
Post here yesterday that the company had no objections to a review
of Law No. 3/1992 on the social security program.
	   The law provides a monopoly to PT Jamsostek to run the social
security program for workers. Companies employing at least 10
workers, or with an annual payroll of more than Rp 1 million, are
obliged to participate in the program.
	   Ackmal, who replaced Abdulla Nusi in the company's top position
two weeks ago, said Jamsostek was also ready to compete if the
government lifted its monopoly and allowed other private companies
to run social security programs for workers.
	   ``We do not see any problem if the government lifts the
monopoly. PT Jamsostek is ready to compete with other companies. A
healthy competition will force us to improve our services to
workers,'' he said.
	   Minister of Manpower Fahmi Idris recently indicated that the
monopoly might be abolished since the people have been demanding
complete transparency and openness in competition.
	   Asked to comment about the planned exodus of over 160,000
cigarette factory workers in Kudus, Central Java, from Jamsostek's
program, Ackmal pointed out that such a move ``would be criminal
because it is against the law (which requires workers to join PT
Jamsostek's program)''.
	   The workers announced Tuesday that they would quit Jamsostek's
social security program and set up their own insurance company.
	   Ackmal denied the allegation that Jamsostek misused Rp 7.1
billion to finance the making of the new labor law, saying ``the
money that was used to finance the law's development came from
government capital in the company, not from the funds collected
from workers.''
	   Then minister of manpower Abdul Latief admitted last year that
Jamsostek funds were used to finance the deliberation of the
controversial bill.
	   Ackmal still displayed optimism yesterday over the future of PT
Jamsostek, but asserted that the company would have to improve its
services and create a transparent management.
	   ``Professionalism and better service are two key principles the
company is determined to improve upon in the future,'' he said.

	   KUANTAN, Wed. - The ninth National Handicap Games scheduled for
August is in limbo as Sabah has backed out from hosting the event.
	   Expressing disappointment with the decision, National Paralympic
Council president Datuk Fauzi Abdul Rahman said today he had yet to
receive any offers from other States to take over as hosts.
	   The biennial meet was inaugurated in 1982 and it was decided at
the last games in Kuching in 1996 that Sabah would host this year's
event.
	   It is jointly organised by the council and National Unity and
Social Development Ministry to unearth talented disabled sportsmen
who could represent the country in the Paralympic Games.
	   ``However, Sabah has withdrawn at the eleventh hour and this has
left the council in a lurch,'' said Fauzi, who is the Deputy
Minister in the Prime Minister's Department.
	   He was speaking to reporters after opening an annexe of the
district day-care centre for disabled children.
	   The RM50,000 project is sponsored by Amoco Chemical (M) Sdn Bhd,
a US- based petrochemical company operating in Gebeng, near here.
	   The centre looks after 33 disabled children.
	   At today's ceremony, Fauzi received another contribution of
RM20,000 from Amoco managing director Jamie Bafkin on behalf of the
centre.
	   Fauzi said the council would try to get other State Governments
to organise the event. He will meet the Menteris Besar and Chief
Ministers to discuss the matter.

	   The provincial prosecutor's office officially removed cartoonist
Bambang Aditya Pradana, alias Yayak, from their wanted list
yesterday after the artist spent seven-years on the run for
allegedly drawing ``subversive'' pictures of former president
Soeharto.
	   Head of the provincial prosecutor's office Suparman said the
decision to exonerate Yayak was taken in response to a request
submitted to his office by the Yogyakarta Legal Aid Institute on
May 29.
	   ``We took the decision in light of calls to reform,'' Suparman
told reporters here.
	   In April 1991, Yayak was put on the wanted list for allegedly
tarnishing Soeharto's image by attempting to distribute 5,000
copies of his cartoons.
	   His artwork, entitled Tanah Untuk Rakyat (Land for the People),
which mostly depicted Soeharto using the military to abuse the
people, was considered ``subversive'' by officials.
	   Budi Santosa, the legal aid institute spokesman, said his client
was currently in Germany.
	   ``We'll tell Yayak the news so that he can return to
Indonesia,'' Budi said.

Foreigners flee Guinea-Bissau amid fighting in capital

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Lisbon news conference on evacuation, TV footage &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Fighting between renegade soldiers and
government troops raged in the capital of Guinea-Bissau on Thursday
while foreigners were evacuated by ship from the West African
nation.
	   A Portuguese merchant ship docked in Bissau left for Dakar in
neighboring Senegal at 6 p.m. (1800GMT) with between 1,500 and
2,000 foreigners on board, Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres said.
	   The evacuees were mostly Portuguese but also included 20 other
nationalities, Guterres told a news conference.
	   A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Bissau said the evacuation took
place amid ``significant fighting.''
	   ``The rebels are shelling downtown districts and the
government's troops are shelling them,'' Bryan Hunt said in a
telephone interview.
	   Footage broadcast by Portuguese state television RTP showed
dozens of local people, carrying children and luggage, bursting
through the port gates and pushing past troops in a scramble to get
onto the ship.
	   Several mortar shells apparently fired by the rebels landed in
the port area during the three-hour evacuation, RTP reported.
	   The city's airport has been closed since Sunday, when an unknown
number of rebels led by former armed forces chief Brig. Gen.
Ansumane Mane launched a coup attempt.
	   Following a burst of fighting, the rebels took refuge in a
military garrison in the suburb of Bra, where they remained
surrounded by government forces and troops sent by Senegal and the
Republic of Guinea. A radio report saying 30 people have been
killed could not be confirmed.
	   Guinea-Bissau Foreign Minister Fernando Delfim da Silva said the
government was ready to talk with the trapped rebels if they laid
down their weapons.
	   ``The government has been holding off while the evacuation takes
place,'' Delfim da Silva told the Associated Press by phone.
	   ``After that, there will have to be some sign from the rebels.
If there isn't, there'll be war,'' said Delfim da Silva, who was
stuck in Lisbon due to flight cancellations.
	   A Chinese merchant ship evacuated 53 Russians and others from
former Soviet republics, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Mane was fired as armed forces chief in January amid allegations
he was involved in smuggling arms to rebels in Senegal. He has
accused President Joao Bernardo Vieira of corruption and called on
him to step down so that early elections can be held.
	   Vieira himself came to power in a 1980 coup. He was elected in
the country's first democratic elections for president and
parliament four years ago.
	   Guinea-Bissau, a former Portuguese colony, has a population of
about 1 million.

	   KOTA BARU, Wed. - Kelantan can expect increased supply of
freshwater fish after the State Fisheries Department releases
several species of fish fry at three locations beginning this
month.
	   Its director Sani Mohd Isa said the department chose three
rivers in two districts for the project.
	   The rivers were Sungai Pasir Era and Sungai Lata Rek, both in
Kuala Krai and Sungai Kelantan in Kemubu, he said.
	   He added that the first release of fish fry would be in Sungai
Lata Rek at the end of the month.
	   He said the project, launched earlier this year, aimed to
replenish the population of freshwater fish in its natural habitat.
	   ``The department has an allocation of RM15,000 to buy fish fry
as well as freshwater prawns this year,'' he added.
	   He said the project would not only help supplement fishermen's
income but also boost local fish production.
	   He encouraged more people to rear freshwater fish as the returns
were good.

	   SAMARINDA, East Kalimantan: Several cities in the province could
be vulnerable to severe flooding during the coming rainy season
because of the poor condition of water catchments, particularly
those located along the Mahakam river, an official said yesterday.
	   ``Illegal logging and forest fires have severely damaged water
catchment areas in the Mahakam river basin,'' head of the
provincial Environmental Impact Management Agency, Awang Farouk,
said.
	   Fires in the early part of this year destroyed at least 543,000
hectares of forest, he said.
	   ``What is more tragic however is that most of the areas burned
were water catchment areas.
	   ``We predict that some cities in the province, including
Samarinda, will be heavily flooded when the rains come later this
year,'' he added.
	   Water quality in the Mahakam river is also deteriorating, he
said.
	   ``There are 25 companies engaged in coal mining, and plywood and
glue production along the course of the Mahakam. These companies
have caused pollution levels in the river to rise considerably,''
he said as quoted by Antara.

	   IPOH, Wed. - Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk
Seri Megat Junid Megat Ayob will meet rice millers and wholesalers
tomorrow to discuss the possibility of reducing the price of Super
grade rice.
	   ``The meeting will give us a clearer picture as why there was an
increase in the price of rice and will find ways of preventing any
further hike and at the same time try to bring down prices,'' he
said.
	   Speaking to reporters after attending the State Umno liaison
committee meeting at the Menteri Besar's residence here yesterday,
Megat Junid said he had met officials of Padiberas Nasional Bhd
(Bernas) yesterday following a recent complaint of the increase in
the price of Super grade rice. He said the feedback from Bernas was
necessary to prepare him for the meeting with the millers and
wholesalers.
	   According to him, Malaysia's total rice consumption annually was
about 1.8 million metric tonnes including 600,000 tonnes of
imported rice.
	   ``So I do not know why the price of local rice has also gone
up,'' he said.
	   The Minister also noted if the wholesalers and rice millers
refused to bring down the prices, the ministry would have to find a
solution.
	   ``We will also discuss the matter with the Ministry of
Agriculture,'' he added.
	   Bernas is selling a 10kg packet of Super grade rice with five
per cent broken content for RM14, while a packet with 10 per cent
broken content is being sold for RM13.80 and those with 15 per cent
broken content are sold for RM13.
	   ``I do not understand why the price has gone up to RM20 per
packet of 10 kg which gives the traders a big profit,'' he said.
	   ``If the profit margin is RM2 we can accept but not RM7 as in
certain cases.'' Yesterday Bernas refuted allegations that it was
the cause of the price increase and instead put the blame on the
wholesalers and retailers.
	   So far, only the Premium Grade rice is controlled which is fixed
at RM1.05 per kg.
	   However, he said since it was of low quality, there was no
demand for it.

	   DILI, East Timor: As many as 21 sympathizers of the separatist
Fretilin group living in the western part of East Timor have
surrendered to the Maubara district military command in Liquisa
district.
	   ``Eighteen of them surrendered last Thursday and the rest last
Sunday. They are now under the guidance of the district military
command,'' chief of the Wira Dharma regional military command, Lt.
Col. Supadi, told journalists here yesterday.
	   Supadi said they would not be brought to court since they
surrendered on their own free will.
	   They will be sent back to their families soon, he added.
	   The guidance program they are currently taking is aimed at
preventing them from being influenced by groups seeking to disrupt
stability and order in the province, Supadi said, as quoted by

	   For housewife Zainun Salleh, 42, (above) of Kampung Bukit
Tunggal, Kuala Terengganu, everytime it rains her kitchen will be
flooded sometimes up to more than one metre deep.
	   ``Other than being dirty and smelly, the rain water is also
posing a grave danger to our children who might drown if they are
not careful,'' she said.
	   She said this problem started almost a year ago when a few
housing developers decided to level the hills behind their house
causing erosion and the monsoon drains nearby to clog.
	   ``Besides erosion, we also get dirty water which flows from a
nearby medical centre right into our house,'' she added.
	   The couple had brought up the matter several times with the
local authorities and the developers but to no avail.

	   Indonesia will not object the decision by the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to arrange political asylum
for 22 Acehnese who are seeking refuge at the United States embassy
and UN compound in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``Indonesia in principle treats the 22 Acehnese people as
illegal workers and it depends on the Malaysian government and
UNHCR on how to treat them,'' Gaffar Fadyl, spokesman for the
Indonesian Foreign Affairs Ministry, said here yesterday.
	   Gaffar made the statement in reaction to the UNHCR's recent
decision to treat them as asylum seekers and to seek third
countries which were ready to give them asylum.
	   AP reported from Kuala Lumpur yesterday that the UN would
arrange political asylum for the 22 Indonesians who took refuge in
the United States embassy and UN compound here to escape
deportation.
	   ``We have interviewed all 22 of them, we have investigated, and
we have concluded that they are refugees and in need of
international protection,'' Hege Rudd of the UNHCR said.
	   The UNHCR had not decided where the refugees would be given
asylum, Rudd said, adding that they could be sent to different
countries.
	   ``The UNHCR is in close communication with the Malaysian
government to see what the next step will be for these refugees,''
she said.
	   The UN was asked to intervene after the Indonesians refused to
leave the U.S. embassy in downtown Kuala Lumpur, saying that they
would be tortured and possibly killed by the Indonesian military if
they were deported.
	   The refugees are all from Aceh, on the northern tip of Sumatra,
where an armed separatist movement has been active since the 1970s.
	   Fleeing a police crackdown on illegal migrants, 14 Indonesians
rammed a truck through the gates of the UNHCR compound on March 30.
	   Eleven days later, eight more Acehnese hoisted themselves over
the walls of the U.S. embassy and sought political asylum.
	   The UNHCR would try to resettle the 22 men by seeking legal
protection, and in certain cases, citizenship, from governments who
agreed to allow them in, the official said.
	   But the fate of two dozen other Indonesians who scrambled over
the walls of the Swiss, French and Brunei embassies on April 9
hangs in balance.
	   Unlike the U.S. and the UN, these embassies handed the illegal
immigrants over to Malaysian police, who took them to a detention
camp.
	   ``The UNHCR has not been able to see them,'' said Rudd.
	   Malaysia says the Acehnese are economic migrants, not political
refugees, and hence should be deported like all other foreigners
found working without valid permits.
	   Malaysia has already deported 30,000 Indonesians this year in an
attempt to secure jobs for its own people as its economy heads into
recession.
	   Prior to the Southeast Asian economic crisis, hundreds of
thousands of foreign workers were welcomed in Malaysia and provided
much of the work force in the booming property sector. Of the 8
million labor force in the property sector, 3 million were migrant
workers, half of them Indonesian.

	   PERAK attracted RM145 million worth of investments in various
sectors in the first two months of this year.
	   This is a marginal increase over the RM130.8 million the State
drew for the same period last year, said Menteri Besar Tan Sri
Ramli Ngah Talib after the State Executive Council meeting in Ipoh
yesterday.
	   He said although the increase was small, the Perak State
Government was glad that there was an increase in investment.
	   ``Any increase in investment, no matter how small, is good news
especially during the current economic situation the country is
facing,''
	   he added.
	   Meanwhile, Ramli said 16 companies, comprising Malaysian and
foreign establishments, were now in negotiations with the State
Government and other companies to set up ventures in Perak.
	   These companies are involved in various manufacturing
activities, including machinery, food, textiles, plastics and wood
products.
	   ``Most of these potential investments would be welcomed by the
State,''
	   said Ramli.

Opposition presidential candidate: 'I would not extradite Samper.'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAVIER BAENA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ In a televised presidential debate,
opposition candidate Andres Pastrana surprised Colombians by
declaring he would not extradite President Ernesto Samper if the
United States so requested.
	   Samper's hand-picked successor and once his fiercest defender,
Horacio Serpa, responded Wednesday night to the same hypothetical
question with the opposite answer: If the law required him to do
so, he would extradite the incumbent.
	   A day after losing to Samper four years ago, Pastrana disclosed
that his opponent's election campaign had accepted dlrs 6 million
from the Cali drug cartel.
	   A highly partisan Congress cleared Samper of drug corruption
charges and Serpa, as interior minister, vehemently defended his
former boss.
	   But during Wednesday's presidential debate, the last of two
before a June 21 runoff, Serpa said he would extradite Samper if
required by law ``regardless of my affections.''
	   ``I know that Samper is honorable, I have always been loyal to
him, but in the realm of hypothesis, a leader cannot make
exceptions in applying the law,'' the candidate of the governing
Liberal Party explained in a radio interview Thursday.
	   Pastrana, of the opposition Conservative Party, said he was
appalled at Serpa's statement and during the debate twice
repeated'' ``I would not extradite Samper.''
	   Samper does not face any criminal charges in the United States,
although the U.S. government stripped him of his tourist visa in
1996, convinced he solicited the drug contributions.
	   As president, Samper has refused U.S. requests to extradite four
convicted Cali drug traffickers.
	   A law enacted in December overturned a constitutional ban on
extradition, but the country's highest court is now considering the
legality of a clause that bars the extradition of Colombians for
crimes committed prior to its enactment.
	   During the debate, Serpa may have been trying to distance
himself from Samper. Pastrana has repeatedly attacked Serpa's
association with the scandal-tainted incumbent.
	   Pastrana's answer to the Samper extradition question, meanwhile,
was seen as an act of generosity. Pastrana has been accused of
being vengeful toward Samper and many Colombians considered him a
sore loser in 1994 for exposing the drug money in his opponent's
campaign.
	   A poll of 450 people showed Pastrana winning Wednesday night's
debate by 50 percent to 37 percent. The telephone survey in five
cities by the Invamer Gallup organization had a margin of error of
4.6 percentage points.
	   In the May 31 first round of presidential voting, Serpa won 34.6
percent of the vote against 34.3 percent for Pastrana.

Controversial paternity test on Yves Montand negative
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from Drossart's mother &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERRE-ANTOINE SOUCHARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The results of a DNA test on the corpse of
legendary French singer Yves Montand show he did not father a young
woman who for years claimed to be his love child, judicial sources
said Thursday.
	   ``Montand will be able to rest in peace,'' the singer's adoptive
daughter, Catherine Allegret, later told French radio. She said she
had read the results of the DNA tests which showed Montand was not
the father of Aurore Drossart.
	   Throughout his life, Montand had denied Drossart, 24, was his
daughter and refused to undergo DNA tests while alive.
	   But after years of trying, Drossart and her mother, Anne, won a
court-ordered exhumation of Montand's corpse from Paris'
Pere-Lachaise cemetery. It was carried out in March. Drossart was
present.
	   Four years ago, a Paris court concluded Montand was Aurore's
father, on the basis of physical resemblance as well as the fact
the Montand had refused twice to undergo blood tests to verify the
claim.
	   The DNA tests were negative, according to the judicial sources,
who spoke on condition they not be named.
	   Aurore's mother, Anne Fleurange, reiterated her ``absolute
certainty of the paternity of Yves Montand of her daughter'' in an
interview on France-2 radio. She also said she would not give up
her efforts to have Montand recognized as Aurore's father.
	   For Montand's family, the issue appeared closed.
	   Allegret, the adopted daughter, said finally his family would be
able to ``get out of the nightmare'' that had overshadowed their
lives.
	   ``I am shattered, because I think of the infamy of this
procedure ... the ignominy of this exhumation.'' Allegret said.
There is no reason to be triumphant, she added, ``because it is so
sad and sordid.''
	   Allegret is the daughter of Simone Signoret, Montand's companion
of 36 years who died in 1985. The couple had no children. Montand
had a child, Valentin, in 1988 with his companion, Carole Amiel.
	   ``He always said while he was alive that he didn't have any
responsibility toward this young woman ... It's too bad he wasn't
believed,'' Amiel said on TF1 television.
	   Montand's heirs were horrified by the exhumation so long after
his death in 1991.
	   Geneticists at the Institut Medicolegal in Paris compared DNA
from Montand's teeth to that of Drossart's.
	   Montand was beloved in France, where his melancholy love songs
and cabaret-style ditties won him a loyal following. He also was a
versatile screen actor, starring in movies such as Claude Berri's
``Jean de Florette'' and ``Z,'' by Costa Gavras.
	   ``Les Feuilles Mortes,'' translated into English as ``Autumn
Leaves,'' was one of his most famous love songs.
	   Montand died of a massive heart attack at age 70, three days
before he was to testify in Drossart's paternity suit.

	   SREBRENICA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ For the first time since
the war ended in Bosnia, Muslim women expelled from Srebrenica
visited their family graves at the site of what is believed to be
the war's worst massacre.
	   Escorted by peacekeepers on Thursday and cordoned-off by Bosnian
Serb police from jeering Serb bystanders on sidewalks, two busloads
of women headed straight for the grave site at Kazan cemetery in
Srebrenica.
	   In the summer of 1995, in one of the worst incidents of ethnic
cleansing in the Bosnian war, Bosnian Serb troops overran the
Muslim enclave in eastern Bosnia.

	   The rupiah broke the 13,000 barrier against the U.S. dollar in
thin morning trade yesterday but managed to recover slightly in the
afternoon to end the day at 12,900.
	   Currency dealers attributed the rupiah's slump to political
uncertainty at home and weak regional markets.
	   The sharp drop in the currency dragged down local stock prices
as investors became concerned that the rupiah's fall would further
dampen operations of publicly listed companies.
	   The market sentiment, hit by political uncertainty over the last
several weeks, was affected by fears over the Japanese yen's drop
against the U.S. dollar and a possible devaluation of the Chinese
yuan.
	   ``This negative sentiment hit both the rupiah and the stock
market,'' one analyst said.
	   Currency dealers said that the rupiah, which opened yesterday at
11,800 against the greenback, might further sink to 15,000 in the
days ahead should regional markets continue their downward trend on
top of political uncertainty at home.
	   The rupiah plunged to 14,500 against the dollar on Jan. 27 after
reaching a record low of 16,800 on Jan. 9.
	   ``Should there be any major social and political unrest in the
days ahead, the rupiah could touch uncharted territory,'' one
dealer said.
	   The country's social and political uncertainties have remained
unresolved, with more protests seen in several major cities here
demanding companies to raise wages and an end to rampant nepotism
and corruption.
	   Following a public protest against Maspion Group in Surabaya,
East Java, the previous day, more than 1,000 employees of the
state-owned airline PT Garuda Indonesia, including pilots in their
airline uniforms, staged a protest demanding a total management
overhaul and the eradication of corruption, nepotism and collusion
from the airline.
	   An economist with Danareksa Sekuritas, Raden Pardede, said
yesterday that similar protests would further hamper the country's
efforts to improve its economic situation.
	   ``If similar social unrest takes place, the country's political
situation will worsen,'' he said, adding that efforts to bring the
country out of its dire crisis would not bear any fruit.
	   He said the country's economy and financial markets would likely
weaken in the medium and long terms if there were no clear-cut
measures introduced by the government to address political
problems.
	   ``Political stability is the key factor in healing the country's
economy and financial markets. The longer the political
uncertainties remain unresolved, the longer it will take to improve
our economy,'' another analyst said.
	   Following the fall of the rupiah, stock prices on the Jakarta
Stock Exchange (JSX) closed 0.7 percent lower or 2.92 points to
408.08 yesterday on a total turnover of 250.72 million shares on
the regular market valued at Rp 235.59 billion (US$20.48 million).
	   Stockbrokers said that trading in the local bourse remained
lethargic for the whole trading day with most investors seen
placing large selling orders on most stocks.
	   ``I think investors are fully aware that the country's economy
will continue to deteriorate,'' a dealer with Bali Securities said
yesterday.
	   He attributed the mild decline in the main price to arbitrage
buying on cross-listed stocks like PT Telkom and Indosat to benefit
from the weakening rupiah.
	   The stock prices of the state telecommunications firm PT Telkom
and satellite operator Indosat account for about 30 percent of
market capitalization in the local exchange.

	   MOTOROLA Malaysia Sdn Bhd expects its annual purchases from its
string of local component suppliers to reach a total value of RM1
billion in the year 2000, compared to RM785 million last year.
	   The company said this in a statement issued yesterday to
announce its participation at the SMI Showcase 98 - Electrical &AMP;
Electronics and Telecommunications which will be held at the Putra
World Trade Centre from June 25 to 29.
	   To date, Motorola sources from more than 100 local suppliers,
various types of components ranging from semiconductor lead frames,
flexible circuit boards, LCD, precision tooling, engineering
plastic parts and packaging.
	   Also, it has another 500 local partners which supply and service
the company's daily factory maintenance, repairs and operational
requirements for each of its five manufacturing facilities in
Selangor, Penang and Seremban.
	   ``Local sourcing to Motorola means we will actively develop
local suppliers and provide overall support to them in technology,
management and training.
	   ``This investment helps them become our preferred suppliers
besides raising their technical level, allowing them to expand
their growth in other directions,'' vice-president and country
manager Ramli Abbas said.
	   The SMI Showcase 98, organised by the Small and Medium
Industries Development Corporation, will exhibit the goods and
services offered by the country's SMIs.
	   It also has another feature namely the ``Apec Cross Border
Linkages''
	   which provides opportunities to participating companies to match
their businesses with those of visiting companies from Apec
countries.
	   Motorola said eight local companies which it has helped to
develop into major OEM suppliers will also be exhibiting its wares
at the SMI Showcase 98.
	   These companies are BCM Electronics Corporation Sdn Bhd, PMM
Components Sdn Bhd, Precision Tool Tech Sdn Bhd, QDOS Flexcircuits
Sdn Bhd, Semiconductor Assembler and Manufacturer Sdn Bhd, Statsym
Sdn Bhd, The Sand Pipers Sdn Bhd, and Wong Engineering Corporation
Bhd.

	   The government is to abolish tuition fees for all state schools
in an attempt to ease the devastating impact of the monetary crisis
which has resulted in nearly one out of every three children
dropping out of school.
	   Minister of Education and Culture Juwono Sudarsono said the

afford it, children would be exempted from purchasing new school
uniforms.

to support their education,'' Juwono said after attending a monthly
cabinet meeting on social welfare and poverty alleviation programs.
	   It is not clear whether state senior vocational high schools are
include in the scheme.
	   After the three-hour meeting, Juwono briefed journalists
together with Minister of Cooperatives Adi Sasono and Minister of
Information Yunus Yosfiah.
	   Without providing details, Juwono revealed the daunting
statistic that 30 percent of school children across the country had
dropped out of school since the monetary crisis hit Indonesia last
July.
	   The country's per capita annual income has plunged from about
US$1,100 before the crisis in July to less than $300.
	   Minister of Manpower Fahmi Idris said last week that at least 15
million people would become unemployed this year.
	   According to Juwono the government will provide annual
scholarships worth Rp 120,000 (US$9) each for 4 percent of the
country's 29 million primary school pupils, and Rp 240,000 for 16.1
percent of the 9.6 million junior high school students.
	   The government will also allocate Rp 2 million annually as an
operational cost for each of the 69,300 primary schools, or 40
percent of the total government schools which are considered most
needy.
	   Another Rp 4 million will go to help each of the 30,391 junior
high schools, which make up 40 percent of all junior high schools
in the country.
	   However the government does not feel able to provide financial
assistance to the country's 5 million senior high school students
and the 185,000 university students.
	   ``We are still waiting for the agreement between the government
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as the government is very
dependent on the IMF,'' Juwono explained.
	   Juwono said the government program would be funded by the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in addition to its own
financial resources.
	   ``This is our fate now,'' Adi remarked about the dependence on
the international agencies.
	   When asked about the fate of private school students Juwono
acknowledged that his ministry could not do much.
	   He expressed hope that private schools would do their best to
help their students who are facing severe financial hardships.
	   ``I also hope that students are no longer forced to buy books,''
Juwono noted.
	   Juwono promised to give attention to teachers whose salaries
were often cut by their superiors without higher approvals.
	   ``I have heard this complaint since 1957, when I was still at
junior high school,'' he remarked.
	   Adi further highlighted the increasingly dire circumstances the
country was facing.
	   He noted a drastic increase in the number of people living below
the poverty line.
	   He said the number had swelled from 17 million to 25 million
within a year.
	   During yesterday's cabinet meeting President B.J. Habibie
ordered Minister of Health Anfasa Moeloek to speed up efforts to
import as many medicine raw materials as possible to force down the
prices of pharmaceuticals.
	   ``The quality of the medicines and their expiry dates should
also closely be monitored,'' Yunus quoted Habibie as saying.
	   Adi said that the government's efforts to accelerate the
distribution of commodities through small cooperatives had shown
encouraging progress, especially regarding cooking oil.
	   ``I received a report that the price has dropped from Rp 7,000
per liter to Rp 4,000,'' Adi said as he smilingly added ``I do hope
that this report is accurate''.
	   Adi, a former Soeharto critic, said the government had no choice
but to promote cooperatives and small businesses as more than 90
percent the country's 202 million population depended on this
sector.
	   ``Bank loans benefit less than one percent of the country's
population while 38.9 million small entrepreneurs are waiting in
vain,'' he noted.

	   Crippled by the economic crisis and pressured by its employees,
the financially distraught national flag carrier Garuda Indonesia
promised yesterday to sever links with companies linked to
Soeharto's family and cronies and return leased aircraft to ensure
its survival.
	   Speaking to more than 2,000 employees protesting outside Garuda
headquarters on Jl. Medan Merdeka Selatan and demanding total
reform of the company, Garuda president Soepandi said he was ready
to step down if necessary to facilitate reform.
	   ``Your demands are in line with our current policy; I'm ready to
be replaced, and I will soon be replaced,'' Soepandi told the
demonstrating employees.
	   The employees booed and demanded Soepandi -- a former adjutant
to former president Soeharto -- resign on charges of corruption,
collusion and nepotism.
	   Soepandi then rushed into the Garuda building and held a press
conference on the 21st floor to explain the company's short-term
plans to survive the crisis.
	   He said he would annul cooperation with private companies linked
to Soeharto's family, including cargo handler PT Angkasa Bina
Wisesa and PT Bimantara Graha Insurance Brokers and PT Ototrans.
	   Angkasa Bina Wisesa is allegedly controlled by Soeharto's sister
Martini Tubagus Sulaeman, and Bimantara Graha Insurance Brokers is
owned by the Bimantara Group, which is controlled by Soeharto's
second son Bambang Trihatmodjo.
	   According to Garuda employees' spokesman Captain Shadrach M.
Nababan, Garuda suffered losses of Rp 6 billion (US$500,000) a
month in its cooperation with Angkasa Bina Wisesa.
	   Bimantara Graha Insurance Brokers has allegedly monopolized the
insurance of Garuda's airplanes.
	   Soepandi added that Garuda would also meet the employees' demand
to return leased aircraft and only use planes it owned itself to
reduce mounting costs due to the weakening rupiah.
	   ``In our survival plan we are trying to return all the aircraft
that we have leased. It is still under negotiation, but we only
want to operate aircraft that we have already paid for,'' he said.
	   Garuda operations director Captain Dharmadi added that the
company would return six leased McDonnell Douglas MD-11s on June 15
as part of the restructuring of its fleet from its existing 57
aircraft to 45 by next year.
	   Under the plan, Garuda will also return six Airbus Industrie
A-330s, Dharmadi said.
	   Subakti, a Garuda pilot who joined yesterday's demonstration,
said the return of those planes would phase out all of Garuda's
most modern jets and precipitate a brain drain.
	   ``Frankly speaking, it would reduce further Garuda's
competitiveness in the international market. But I think it's
better to return all those leased planes because their lease prices
were all marked up,'' he said.
	   Nababan added that the company leased an Airbus at US$11,000 per
flying hour but the market price is only US$6,000 to US$8.000 an
hour.
	   Some of the demonstrating employees also questioned Garuda's
policy to hand over ground handling in Bali to PT Ototrans, a
company with allegedly strong link to Soeharto.
	   Companies linked to Soeharto's family and associates have come
under increasing scrutiny since he resigned on May 21 amid mounting
political and economic chaos.
	   The companies have been accused of trading on their ties to the
president to obtain favorable terms in business deals.
	   Nababan, Subakti and eight of their colleagues met yesterday
with State Minister of the Empowerment of State Enterprises Tanri
Abeng to present their demands.
	   ``Reforms must be conducted quickly at Garuda, starting with
changes in the top management,'' said Nababan, who has been a
Garuda pilot for 26 years.
	   Tanri said that the government would appoint a new president for
Garuda by Monday and said the most promising candidate thus far was
banker Robby Johan.
	   ``Robby meets all the criteria; he is professional; he has
integrity; he has experience in restructuring companies and he has
commitment and dedication,'' Tanri said.
	   When asked about Robby, Nababan said he and his friends could
see no problem with the government's choice as long as the
candidate was not picked based on collusion or nepotism and he had
good knowledge about the airline businesses.
	   Contracts
	   Tanri warned that state firms should not arbitrarily annul
contracts with third parties without consulting the government.
	   ``All contracts which need to be reviewed must be identified and
submitted to the government. We will form a team, a task force, to
analyze the contracts,'' Tanri said.
	   When asked about a move by state electricity firm PT Perusahaan
Listrik Negara (PLN) to annul a power-purchase contract with PT
Cikarang Listrindo, Tanri said: ``That's not correct.''
	   He said such an arbitrary act could give a negative image about
Indonesia.
	   PLN president Djiteng Marsudi said last week that it had
notified Cikarang Listrindo, an independent power producer owned by
Soeharto's cousin Sudwikatmono, that PLN would stop buying power
from it beginning June 15.
	   Djiteng said yesterday that if he did not take action to review
his company's contracts, which were forced on PLN in questionable
circumstances stinking of corruption, collusion and nepotism, it
would give a bad precedent to future business practices in the
country.
	   ``And this would worsen our image in international forums,''
Djiteng said.
	   About 200 demonstrators, including students, activists and
retired PLN workers, who billed themselves as a Committee for PLN
Reform, went to the Ministry of Mines and Energy and PLN
headquarters, to give support to Djiteng's move.

	   VARIOUS industries need to establish or fine-tune their codes of
practice with regard to occupational safety and health to ensure
that the workplace is safe and healthy.
	   While there are existing regulations such as the Occupational
Safety and Health Act, these rules are not meant to be specific as
it is better for industries to come up with their own and ensure
that members adhere to these rules.
	   ``The spirit is for them to come up with their own code or what
is practicable,'' said Department of Occupational Safety and Health
director- general Zakaria Nanyan.
	   These codes of practice are accepted as an industry standard and
could be used in court in any dispute.
	   Zakaria said this at a conference on Life, Health &AMP; Safety,
themed `Managing Life, Health &AMP; Safety Risks in the Changing
Environment', organised by The Malaysian Insurance Institute and
The National Institute of Occupational Safety &AMP; Health Malaysia.
	   With an code of practice accepted by its members, it was up to
the industry to discuss why accidents happened and implement new
programmes.
	   ``We should analyse the accidents, why it happened. Often the
worker is blamed but is the worker properly trained, and does the
workplace have a proper system. If there is no system, you cannot
blame the worker.''
	   In some industries such as chemical and petrochemical, an
established code of practice was found to have worked well.
	   ``We (DOSH) will prescribe the regulations as we go along but
the nitty gritty is up to the industries and the safety
committees,'' he said.
	   The current accident rate in Malaysia is three to four times
higher than that in developed countries at 12 accidents per 1,000
workers compared to developed nations where it is about four per
1,000.
	   Last year, the number of occupational accidents was reduced by
29.32 per cent to 95,098 from 134,546 in 1993.
	   The total cost of accidents and injuries is estimated at between
RM1.5 billion and RM2.3 billion last year, where indirect costs are
three to five times of the direct costs.
	   The Social Security Organisation's records showed that in 1997,
it paid out RM383 million in direct costs while in 1993 it was only
RM170 million.
	   Zakaria said the current doctrine on occupational safety and
health was the ``self-regulate'' approach. ``If an accident
happens, the company not only loses a trained worker, but you start
seeing the reject rates going up,'' he added.
	   As such, both parties need to work together to plan and
implement programmes such as training, hazard identification, risk
assessment and others that can make for a better workplace.

	   Mochtar Riady, a senior executive of a major business group,
said here yesterday that Bank Indonesia's policy of rescuing the
country's ailing banks may only worsen the state of the banking
sector.
	   Mochtar, founder and chairman of the Lippo Group which includes
one of the largest banks in the country, said the central bank's
program to strengthen domestic banks only catered to banks which
already had acute problems.
	   ``Ironically, banks with problems are taken care of and rescued
but those that are healthy and are not under IBRA (the Indonesian
Bank Restructuring Agency) are being neglected,'' he said at a
meeting with leading members of the Chamber of Commerce and
Industry (Kadin).
	   IBRA was set up by the government in January to restructure the
banking sector, and is currently overseeing 54 banks, including
seven that were suspended last April.
	   Mochtar said Bank Indonesia (BI) only acted as the lender of
last resort to help banks when the banks suffered problems in their
clearing operations.
	   Banks with positive accounts, however, were ignored and they
were even not allowed to cash in their deposits at the central bank
when they needed them, he said.
	   He cited the recently rocked Bank Central Asia (BCA),
Indonesia's largest private bank, as an example of a bank that
could have been saved had BI stepped in to help it earlier, he
said.
	   ``The central bank's policy did not help save BCA at a time when
the bank was vulnerable to rumors that were ``engineered'' to shake
it so that BCA had to restrict withdrawal amounts, he said.
	   ``Why did BCA not get rescued before the situation got so bad?''
he asked, adding: ``I'm sure that the BCA's turmoil was
engineered.''
	   But he said he did not know who could have been behind the
scenes, saying they must have been ``people who want to see the
economy collapse''.
	   Mochtar, a former president of BCA, said many of the people, who
formed long queues at BCA's Automatic Teller Machines in the
beginning only withdrew small amounts of money.
	   The appearance of a bank rush from these long lines triggered
panic among other customers who then began rushing to the bank, he
said.
	   The management of the country's largest bank was taken over by
IBRA last month, following massive withdrawals by customers which
continued for a week after former president Soeharto stepped down
on May 21.
	   The Salim Group owns 70 percent of the bank, while Soeharto's
children Sigit Hardjojudanto and Siti Hardijanti Rukmana own the
remaining 30 percent.
	   Mochtar also said the restructuring of the banking industry was
crucial to the survival of the private sector.
	   The current tight monetary policy had suffocated the country's
private sector and it would cause many companies to go bankrupt, he
said.
	   Also attending yesterday's meeting was economists Sjahrir, Sri
Mulyani and Pande Radja Silalahi, and the chairman PT Jamu Jago,
Jaya Suprana.

	   DESPITE the economic downturn, sales of Canon's flagship Bubble
Jet printers grew by over 40 per cent for the first quarter of this
year compared to the same period last year.
	   Canon Marketing (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd vice-chairman and joint
managing director Shuichi Tsukahara said the company expects sales
to hit 70,000 units for the first half of this year - a 50 per cent
growth over the first-half of last year.
	   Tsukahara attributed the phenomenal growth to the company's
trailblazing efforts to push sales through increased advertising
even as other companies cut down on such expenditure.
	   ``Canon spent up to RM2 million for the first half of this year
on advertisements alone for our Bubble Jet printers,'' he said.
	   He was speaking to reporters after the launch of four new lines
of products in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday.
	   The company expects to spend a total of RM4 million this year
for Bubble Jet printer advertisements alone.
	   It hopes to increase its market share in ink-jet printers by
three per cent to 58 per cent this year compared to its claimed 55
per cent last year.
	   Meanwhile, the launch of three models of laser printer marked
Canon's entry into the high-end printer market.
	   Canon expects sales of their laser printers to hit 1,000 units
per month for the next six months, capturing 30 per cent of the
market share.
	   Sales of their scanners and digital cameras are also expected to
corner more than 30 per cent of the market.

	   City Military Commander Maj. Gen. Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin called on
Jakartans yesterday to concentrate on their work rather than
joining political activities which could threaten public safety.
	   Addressing a group of farmers at a ceremony to mark the first
harvest of green beans planted jointly with military personnel,
Sjafrie warned about the maneuverings of certain political parties
that were trying hard to agitate people.
	   ``What's the use (of joining a rally) to support someone when at
the same time your stomach is empty?'' he said after symbolically
marking the harvesting of 10 metric tons of beans at Sindang Jaya
village in Pasar Kemis subdistrict here.
	   Sjafrie also appealed to political leaders and reform activists
to channel their aspirations accordingly through constitutional
means in order to prevent social disturbances.
	   He reiterated that the Armed Forces (ABRI) would not tolerate
any movement that could be considered unconstitutional and against
the people's will.
	   ``Let's start to listen to our own consciences.
	   ``If we consider (a movement) improper, just stop it. If it is
considered constructive, please use the right institutions. Don't
confuse the people,'' the two-star general said.
	   ``We all can take part in the reform movement but remember that
common people need food.''
	   For months, Greater Jakarta has witnessed rallies every day.
These have been staged by people from all walks of life -- from
students and workers to politicians and activists.
	   Soeharto's resignation has not seemed to dent the protesters'
ardor. They are now demanding a new president, the resignation of
legislators, councilors and officials and better salaries.
	   Some groups have even occupied buildings in an attempt to
realize their requests.
	   According to Sjafrie, most people in the capital and its
environs no longer like to see too many demonstrations on the
streets every day.
	   ``I think the people are not pleased with this,'' he told the
crowd at the harvest ceremony.
	   The beans harvested yesterday were planted in April on 10
hectares of idle land owned by the Argo Pantes textile group.
	   The project was managed jointly by ABRI, the local
administration and a private firm. The scheme involved 300 military
personnel and 47 local farmers.
	   The beans are to be sold to local cooperatives for between Rp
900 (7 U.S. cents) and Rp 1,000 per kilogram.
	   According to Sjafrie, the Rp 50 million that will be made from
the crops will be distributed to the farmers.
	   The military personnel worked for free, he said.
	   Trisakti trial
	   Meanwhile, City Military Police commander Col. Hendardji said
yesterday that 11 of the 18 officers charged with being involved in
the Trisakti shooting would not be tried by a military court in the
immediate future.
	   They will appear in court only after the weapons they used
during the incident have been submitted to the investigation team,
Hendardji said yesterday.
	   ``The weapons are important evidence in this case.
	   ``So far, we have not received any of them, although the court
submitted a request to the National Police chief,'' he said.
	   Hendardji however failed to name the officers concerned.
	   Two police officers, company commander First Lt. Agus Tri
Heryanto, 29 and platoon leader Second Lt. Pariyo appeared before a
military court in East Jakarta on Saturday and Tuesday
	   The officers, both from the city police mobile brigade, were
charged with undisciplined acts under Article 103 of the Military
Penal Code which carries a maximum sentence of two years and four
months in prison.
	   Four students were killed and many more injured when security
forces opened fire to disperse the student rally at Trisakti
University in Grogol, West Jakarta, on May 12.
	   A bullet with a diameter of 5.56 mm was removed from one of the
victims' bodies on Sunday.
	   A high-ranking military officer revealed yesterday that the
bullet could have originated from a Steyr AUG, an M-16 or an SS-1
rifle.
	   The officer, who asked for anonymity, said Steyrs are used only
by the police, M-16s by all ABRI units and SS-1s were ABRI's
standard shotgun.

	   IBM World Trade Corp has expanded its mainframe offerings with
the launch of the new System/390 Generation 5 (S/390 G5)
enterprise-class server, which is designed to be double the
performance of previous models.
	   The S/390 G5 performs at more than 900 million instructions per
second when configured with 10 microprocessors. Users needing
larger systems can deploy IBM's S/390 Parallel Sysplex clustering
technology. ``The S/390 continues to define the standard in
enterprise computing. It can handle unpredictable workloads and
bring customers the advantage of 30 years of technology leadership
integrated with advanced computing capabilities,''
	   said IBM Malaysia's country market manager for S/390, storage
and printers, Tang Hang Kwang.

	   A father and son were severely wounded in an armed robbery
yesterday at their residence on Jl. Damai Gg. Musyawarah No. 27 in
Pondok Labu, Cilandak, South Jakarta.
	   Five men brandishing sharp weapons reportedly attacked Achmad,
40, and his son Ari Kurniawan, 18, when they broke into the house
at 2 a.m.
	   The two victims are currently being treated at Cipto
Mangunkusumo General Hospital. Achmad was still listed in critical
condition as of 1 p.m. yesterday.
	   South Jakarta Police detective chief Maj. Rycko Amelza Daniel
told The Jakarta Post that the five unidentified men broke into the
house through the front door using a crowbar. They reportedly
rushed into Achmad's bedroom, asking for money.
	   ``The robbers got away with Rp 85,000 in cash, a 15-gram gold
necklace and car documents,'' he said.
	   Before they ran away, Achmad tried to stop them, and that was
when the men attacked him and his son, Rycko said.
	   Achmad suffered from a severe slash wound to the chest and Ari
sustained cuts to his head and stomach.
	   A witness, Achmad's youngest son Halim, reportedly told police
that he heard his father yell at the intruders: ``What are you
doing here?''
	   ``That's why we think that the alleged robbers must have been
known by the victims,'' Rycko said.
	   A group of youths at the housing complex reported to the police
that they saw the five men walk toward the house.
	   ``The five men were saying something about getting money back
from the victim,'' the youngsters were quoted by Rycko as saying.
	   There is a possibility that the case is not a pure robbery,
Rycko added. ``The case may have something to do with some unpaid
debts.''
	   ``Hopefully the case, which will be handled by officers of South
Jakarta Police Precinct and the Cilandak Police Subprecinct, can be
solved soon. We have men at the hospital to dig up more information
on the case.''
	   Separately, Pulogadung police captured a man yesterday suspected
of murdering a high school student a week ago at Pisangan Lama
under the elevated Cawang-Tanjung Priok toll road in East Jakarta.
	   The suspect, Yayah, 19, has reportedly admitted to having killed
Iskandar Habib, 16, a Panglima Jayakarta high school student, over
unpaid debts.
	   ``Iskandar's parents became suspicious when he didn't return
home and reported it to the police. The last time they saw Iskandar
was when he went out with Yayah to a place in Tanjung Priok, North
Jakarta,'' a police officer, who asked not to be named, said.
	   After thoroughly interrogating Yayah, he eventually admitted to
have killed Iskandar because he could not afford to return money he
had borrowed from the victim.
	   Lt. Col. Syahrir Kuba of the East Jakarta precinct said Yayah
admitted to killing Iskandar with the help of three of his friends.
	   ``We're currently looking for the other suspects. Hopefully we
can reveal more information soon.''

	   One of the owners of the Sheraton Media Hotel in Central
Jakarta, Surya Paloh, denied media reports that the hotel was
partly owned by former president Soeharto's family.
	   Paloh said yesterday that the reports were inaccurate and gave
the hotel a bad image.
	   ``They reports have not been thoroughly checked and are
bordering on being libelous,'' he said.
	   He stressed that the 18-story hotel belonged to PT Grahasahari
Suryajaya, which is 75 percent owned by PT Bakti Citra Daya and 25
percent by the city administration.

Foreigners flee Guinea-Bissau amid fighting in capital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Lisbon news conference on evacuation, TV footage &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Fighting between renegade soldiers and
government troops raged in the capital of Guinea-Bissau on Thursday
while foreigners were evacuated by ship from the West African
nation.
	   A Portuguese merchant ship docked in Bissau left for Dakar in
neighboring Senegal at 6 p.m. (1800GMT) with between 1,500 and
2,000 foreigners on board, Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres said.
	   The evacuees were mostly Portuguese but also included 20 other
nationalities, Guterres told a news conference.
	   Guinea-Bissau, a former Portuguese colony, has a population of
about 1 million.
	   A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Bissau said the evacuation took
place amid ``significant fighting.''
	   ``The rebels are shelling downtown districts and the
government's troops are shelling them,'' the spokesman, Bryan Hunt,
said in a telephone interview.
	   Footage broadcast by Portuguese state television RTP showed
dozens of people carrying children and luggage bursting through the
port gates and pushing past troops in a scramble to get onto the
ship.
	   Several mortar shells apparently fired by the rebels landed in
the port area during the three-hour evacuation, RTP reported.
	   The city's airport has been closed since Sunday, when an unknown
number of rebels led by former armed forces chief Brig. Gen.
Ansumane Mane launched a coup attempt.
	   Following a burst of fighting, the rebels took refuge in a
military garrison in the suburb of Bra, where they remained
surrounded by government forces and troops sent by Senegal and the
Republic of Guinea. A radio report saying 30 people have been
killed could not be immediately confirmed.
	   Guinea-Bissau Foreign Minister Fernando Delfim da Silva said the
government was ready to talk with the trapped rebels if they laid
down their weapons.
	   ``The government has been holding off while the evacuation takes
place,'' Delfim da Silva told the Associated Press by phone.
	   ``After that, there will have to be some sign from the rebels.
If there isn't, there'll be war,'' said Delfim da Silva, who was
stuck in Lisbon due to flight cancellations.
	   A Chinese merchant ship evacuated 53 Russians and others from
former Soviet republics, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Mane was fired as armed forces chief in January amid allegations
he was involved in smuggling arms to rebels in Senegal. He has
accused President Joao Bernardo Vieira of corruption and called on
him to step down so that early elections can be held.
	   Vieira himself came to power in a 1980 coup. He was elected in
the country's first democratic elections for president and
parliament four years ago.

	   FUJI Xerox Asia Pacific Pte Ltd has to date achieved RM80
million in sales, which is 40 per cent of its sales target of RM220
million for this year.
	   Last year, the company achieved a turnover of RM200 million, a
20 per cent increase from the previous year.
	   President Kazuo Terakura said the company projected an increase
of 10 per cent in sales this year as it expect sales of its newly
launched high- speed laser printer and digital copier to take off
in a big way.
	   The RM1.3 million US-made Xerox Docuprint 4635 laser printer
lays claim to being the fastest cut-sheet laser printer in
Malaysia, at a speed of up to 135 pages per minute.
	   The company expects 10 such systems to be sold by the end of
this year in spite of the downturn in economy.
	   This is because the printer will help cut costs by 10 to 15 per
cent, depending on a case to case basis, said Terakura after the
launch in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   Its target market includes financial institutions, insurance
companies and large manufacturing companies.
	   Fuji Xerox, a pioneer in copiers, has evolved into a total
document solutions provider and has already cornered 50 per cent of
the market share in Malaysia, according to Terakura.
	   ``With the introduction of our new models, we hope to increase
our market share by another 10 to 15 per cent.''
	   The global market opportunity for digital printing is expected
to reach US$150 billion by the turn of the 20th century, he added.
On how the Internet and electronic publishing will affect its
business which essentially deals with hard copies, product
marketing manager C.T.
	   Soo said the company is prepared to face the new era of
paperless communication.
	   ``We have already forged alliances with strategic partners, for
example, in the area of digital archiving. We will launch new
products when we think the market is ready for them.''
	   Fuji Xerox spends an average of US1.7 billion annually for its
research and development, located principally in California, the US
and Japan.

	   Rushdy Hasan Belbasy, an associate of a murdered Yemeni man,
denied yesterday that he was being sought by the police in
connection with the slaying.
	   ``I was summoned to the city police headquarters in my capacity
only as a witness in the case,'' Rushdy said in a statement faxed
to The Jakarta Post.
	   ``I am not running away and I have left my address with the
police.''
	   The body of the Yemeni, identified as Hasan Muhammad Yeslam, 26,
was discovered at Hotel Pitagiri in Palmerah, West Jakarta, Monday
morning.
	   The victim was found with a neck wound at about 6 a.m. in a room
by a hotel security guard.
	   City police spokesman Lt. Col. E. Aritonang said yesterday the
case was still under investigation.
	   ``Yes, it is all being examined thoroughly. We do not have any
suspects yet but wait for the examination results for more
information,'' he said.

	   A prosecutor asked Tangerang district court to sentence Sopan
Tarigan, 36, to 30 months in jail for attempting to smuggle 25,750
Ecstasy pills and a quantity of the drug in powdered form through
Soekarno-Hatta International Airport.
	   Prosecutor Sity Zahara said in her indictment that the defendant
was arrested by customs and excise officers on Aug. 31 last year
when he collected a black bag from the airport.
	   Officers found the pills and powder in the bag. Sopan claimed he
was asked by a man called Achmadi Surya to collect the bag and did
not know what it contained, she said. Achmadi is still at large.
	   ``Sopan said that he was paid Rp 40,000 to collect the bag and
was also promised a job,'' Sity said.
	   The defendant was charged under Article 62 of Law No.5/1997 on
psychotropic drugs. The article carries a maximum sentence of five
years in jail and a fine of Rp 100 million.
	   Judge Jesminar Idrus adjourned the trial until next week to hear
the defense lawyer's statement.

	   IPOH, Wed. - The High Court today ruled as inadmissible a
confession given to police by a lorry attendant who is facing a
charge of murdering a watchman.
	   Judge Datuk Kang Hwee Gee said the prosecution had failed to
establish why P. Manimaran wanted to confess to the police.
	   He also observed that Manimaran was handcuffed at the time the
confession was taken.
	   ``No person wants to incriminate himself and it appears the
confession was given under compulsion,'' he said.
	   He said there was suspicion based on the demeanour of Manimaran
who appeared to be under duress and oppression.
	   ``Based on these findings, the court rules that the confession
is inadmissible,'' he said.
	   A trial-within-a-trial was held to determine the admissibility
of the confession taken from Manimaran, 32, who is charged with the
murder of Mukang Singh, 70.
	   He is alleged to have committed the offence at Hong Soon Chan
Hup Kee godown at Jalan Tun Perak about 10.30pm on Sept 8, last
year.
	   V.T. Singam, appearing for Manimaran, said his client did not
give the confession on his free will as he was under severe
pressure and oppression.
	   Singam added Manimaran was not even asked whether he was giving
the statement voluntarily by recording officer Chief Inspector D.
	   Saralananthan.
	   Deputy Public Prosecutor Murtazadi Amran in his submission said
Manimaran did not complain when he offered the confession.
	   The trial will continue tomorrow.

Financier rules out more personal loans to Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Billionaire financier George Soros said
Thursday he has no plans to make any more loans to Russia to help
it ride out its economic problems.
	   ``I'm not planning any more loans. As I have said before, I
don't want to make a habit of it,'' Soros said at a press
conference after giving a lecture at the Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute.
	   Earlier this year, Soros disclosed that he personally guaranteed
a loan to the Russian government of several hundred million dollars
in June 1997 to help it meet a promised deadline on pension
arrears.
	   In December, the Russian government approached Soros for a
second loan, but the financier turned down the request.
	   On the world economy, Soros said recession and devaluation in
Japan, Indonesia and nearby countries will likely worsen before
they improve.
	   ``It is clear now that the financial crisis in Southeast Asia
will take longer to solve than believed only six months ago,'' he
said. ``I can see the prospect of worldwide overcapacity and
deflation.''
	   About the weak yen, Soros said, ``Everybody agrees that a
further decline in the yen would be detrimental for the world
economy, but the question is whether intervention can stop its
decline.''
	   South Korea and other countries battered economically in recent
months must restructure their economies, he said, and ``no real
recovery can begin'' until that happens.

	   ``Our sweat had not fully dried after almost 10 years of hard
work when our small drug store was looted and burned by rioters,''
Chinese-Indonesian Anton, not his real name, recalled grimly.
	   His shop, selling a variety of local and Chinese medicines and
herbs on Jl. Raya Ciledug in South Jakarta, was transformed into a
charred building in a matter of hours after mobs forcibly opened
its rolling doors, cleared the contents and set it on fire in the
afternoon of May 13.
	   ``The mobs even took away the bucket and spoons of my little
children,'' Anton told The Jakarta Post last weekend.
	   He said he and his wife built the business -- valued at some Rp
200 million (US$15,500) -- after many years on the bread line.
	   ``It's our only property. And now, it's gone just like that, in
front of my eyes,'' said Anton, a former salesman at Indofood
Sukses Makmur.
	   The only untouched property of the two-children family, who live
with relatives on a housing complex near their damaged shop, is a
Kijang minivan.
	   ``Just in case we're forced to leave this country, we'll sell
that car to obtain passports and visas for me and my family,''
Anton said.
	   His father and grandfather also experienced similarly tough
experiences.
	   ``The shop of my grandfather, who was selling daily goods in a
small village called Desa Bangun in North Sumatra was looted and
burned in an anti-Chinese riot in 1947,'' he said.
	   During another outbreak of racist unrest, in 1990, his father's
shop in the North Sumatra town of Pematang Siantar, which also sold
basic items, was set on fire.
	   Anton's wife, who accompanied him during the interview,
continuously massaged her sweating hands nervously.
	   Anton and his wife, who grew up in Pemanatang Siantar, have no
idea what to do now.
	   ``I spend most of the time at home now. To be honest, I'm still
in a deeply traumatic state.
	   ``Worst of all, most of the people on the streets outside there
still see us, people with the slanting eyes, as if we have
committed big sins against them, and for that they are ready to
kill us,'' he said.
	   ``Ugh... I find that our lives are absolutely worthless
nowadays,'' Anton said.
	   Hard days
	   Like most businessmen whose property was attacked during the May
13 -- May 15 riots, Anton's family is still suffering from the
great shock.
	   Their sleep is mostly colored by repeated nightmares: the fire
that gutted their shop, the cheerful mobs looting their merchandise
and the sea of people, screaming ``burn, burn, burn''.
	   ``Even the ticking of the clock on the wall has woken me
abruptly in the middle of the night and left me in fear,'' said
Anton's wife.
	   The housewife also finds it impossible to block out the screams
of the people trapped in the nearby four-story Ciledug Plaza
department store, which was also set on fire by the mobs that day.
	   ``Every few minutes, the helpless screams ring in my ears and I
can't stop them,'' she said.
	   A few minutes before the interview, a group of junior high
school students, resplendent in painted uniforms, faces and hair,
passed through the housing complex carrying stones, belts and
sticks in their hands.
	   The students, who had just celebrated their graduation day, were
apparently ready for a brawl.
	   While passing through the complex, they shouted anti-Chinese
remarks.
	   ``You Chinese people have done nothing for this country. Now
come out from your hiding places,'' screamed one of the students
under the watchful eyes of the local residents.
	   Earlier in the day, Anton's 10-year-old daughter, Sinta (not her
real name) hurriedly came back from school and asked her mother:
``Mother, are the people going to kill all Chinese-Indonesian
families like us?''
	   Anton's wife could only hug her eldest daughter without giving
any explanation.
	   The girl said she read a lot of graffiti painted on buildings on
the way to her school, almost all of which was anti-Chinese, such
as ``Kill the Chinese'' or ``Kick the Chinese out''.
	   ``How could you explain such things to a little girl like her?''
asked the mother.
	   ``God, I have no tears left,'' she whispered.
	   A day earlier, Anton cleaned up a painted ``BMC'' sign left by
an unidentified person on their house's front fence.
	   ``I don't know anything about the sign but my neighbors told me
to quickly remove it because the letters stand for Basmi Milik Cina
(Destroy Chinese Property),'' he said.
	   Similar signs can still be found on several houses and buildings
believed to be owned by Chinese-Indonesians in certain areas of the
city.
	   Since the riots erupted, Anton has displayed in front of his
house a Moslem prayer mat and banners written in Arabic. He
borrowed them from his neighbors.
	   ``We have no other option,'' he said.
	   He, however, hopes that the country will still be able to
protect the lives of the Chinese-Indonesians.
	   ``This is also our country. We were all born and grew up here,''
Anton said.
	   Data from the Coordinating Body for National Unity (Bakom PKB)
reveals that 1,286 Chinese-Indonesians have reported to the agency
as being victims of the recent riots.
	   Some of the helpless victims were raped and molested by the
mobs, chairwoman Roesita Noer told reporters yesterday.
	   ``Bakom PKB, therefore, urges ABRI (the Armed Forces) to give
security guarantees to the Chinese-Indonesians,'' she said.

	   SCS Computer System Sdn Bhd, a systems integration services
company, contributed 66,533 one sen coins (RM665.53) to the ``1 Sen
Fun'' campaign yesterday.
	   Executive chairman Tunku Shahabuddin Tunku Besar Burhanuddin

emptying the coins into the collection box at the SCS computer

	   Tunku Shahabuddin said it took 2 1/2 months to collect the coins
from the staff. The initiative to contribute towards the campaign
came from the company's ``Caring Committee'', which was formed last
year to help the needy.
	   ``Being a service-oriented company this is one of our ways of
extending our services beyond business to help society,'' he added.

	   The commemoration of Jakarta's 471st anniversary next month will
be a very modest occasion due to the limited availability of funds,
deputy governor for administrative affairs Abdul Kahfi said
yesterday.
	   ``This year's commemoration will be different from the one we
held last year. This one will really be far from luxurious. Even
the ceremonial parts will be held more as a formality,'' he told
The Jakarta Post.
	   Unlike previous commemorations, which were regularly held on
June 22, this year's celebration will be on July 4. Kahfi did not
explain the change of date.
	   He also declined to disclose other details of the ceremonies or
their estimated budget but reiterated that the celebration would be
held in a much more modest way.
	   The administration's plan to celebrate Jakarta's anniversary
modestly was hailed by city councilors.
	   The head of the United Development Party faction, Rusjdi Hamka,
said the administration must avoid big-budget activities.
	   ``Celebrating the anniversary with an extravagant party will be
of no benefit to anyone. I think, a grand dangdut music party, like
those held in Ancol over the past few years, is not necessary
now,'' he said.
	   Lukman F. Mokoginta, the head of the Indonesian Democratic Party
faction, also said there was no need to hold an extraordinary
plenary session of the City Council in conjunction with the
commemoration, as has been the case in the past.
	   ``That's a very high-cost function. I suggest the council and
the administration plan only one simple event, such as a tumpengan
(a ceremony in which yellow rice cone is served) perhaps. That's
cheaper,'' he said.
	   Lukman also suggested that all events linked to the
commemoration be centralized and directly handled only by the
administration, to save money.
	   ``I don't think the city's five mayoralties should plan their
own programs as well,'' he said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - Watch a movie and contribute to a
much-needed fund that will help save cancer patients.
	   The appeal comes from the National Cancer Council (Makna) which
is now organising a charity premiere, City of Angels, on June 14.
	   Reacting to the call, Crown Princess Inter-Continental Kuala
Lumpur will issue 200 Crown Princess privileged cards to those who
buy the RM150 tickets for the show.
	   The cards will enable them get 20 per cent discount at any of
the six restaurants at the hotel.
	   Its regional communication manager Audrey Lim presented a mock
card to Makna chief executive officer Datuk P. Venugopal at Balai
Berita today.
	   Also present was Makna project manager Farahida Mohd Farid.
	   ``Every year without fail, we try to reach out to the disabled,
orphaned and those in need of aid. I believe that we should give
them a hand whenever we can,'' she said.
	   Venugopal said any form of contribution would go a long way in
helping the council to provide a better health care system,
especially in the prevention and control of cancer.
	   ``Proceeds will go towards our efforts to help people get access
to information and treatment against cancer,'' he said.
	   Sales of tickets have brought in RM25,000 so far.
	   Featuring Academy Award winner Nicolas Cage and two-time Golden
Globe nominee Meg Ryan, the story is about the romance between a

	   Golkar must quickly transform itself or possibly face life in
political oblivion after the government introduces a new law on
political parties in the next few months.
	   Political analyst Ryaas Rasyid said the ruling political
organization should immediately transform its political foundation
from a coalition of social and business groups into a purely
political party.
	   ``Golkar, despite its claim to be a representation of various
social and business groups, has obviously acted as a political
party,'' Ryaas, the rector of the state-run Institute for Public
Administration (IIP), told The Jakarta Post.
	   ``And we will not recognize it as a representation of various
social and business groups anymore,'' he said.
	   Speaking as the coordinator of a seven-member team responsible
for preparing drafts for three political laws on political parties,
general elections and the structure and position of the House of
Representatives/People's Consultative Assembly, Ryaas suggested
that Golkar immediately change its structure into a formal
political party.
	   ``It shouldn't be a problem for Golkar as it needs to change its
name only since physically it is a political party already,'' he
said.
	   Internally, Golkar is facing a serious threat of disintegration,
especially after one of its traditional allies, the Musyawarah
Kekeluargaan Gotong Royong (MKGR), broke ranks from Golkar and
turned itself a separate political party late last month.
	   Golkar's business wing Kosgoro, though still loyal to Golkar, is
apparently taking a wait-and-see approach to the latest
developments in the political situation. However it has indicated a
desire to also go it alone as a political party.
	   In response to the snowballing reform movement, several
political parties have been established lately, among them the
Indonesian Women's Party (PP), the Indonesian Workers Party (PPI)
and the Chinese-Indonesians Reform Party (Parti).
	   For nearly three decades the government has kept a tight reign
on political activities and only recognizes Golkar, the United
Development Party and the Indonesian Democratic Party.
	   However the newly established cabinet under President B.J.
Habibie has opened the floodgates and is allowing the almost daily
birth of new political organizations as people begin to look ahead
to a free general election.
	   ``People are free to establish political parties of their own,''
Minister of Home Affairs Syarwan Hamid said yesterday. ``However,
their legality will still rest on the new law on political parties
which is now under preparation''.
	   Ryaas believes that after a process of ``natural screening'',
ideally there should be more than 10 political parties contending
the election.
	   District
	   However Ryaas pointed out that the new electoral system would
likely be a hybrid of the district system and the principles of the
proportional representation system which the country currently
applies.
	   ``We still have to think of the parties which will fail the
screening... We still have to accommodate those losing elements in
our political system,'' he added.
	   He said that the team drafting the new law would divide the
country's regions into 400 districts with each district equivalent
to 200,000 voters.
	   ``Therefore, we will have 400 legislators in the 500-seat House,
elected through the district election system, while the remaining
100 seats will be decided through a combined proportional-district
system,'' he said.
	   The team plans to complete its drafts for the three political
laws before August, to allow the government time to publicize the
drafts among the public in a bid to accommodate comments and
inputs.
	   ``However, we (team members) are confident that the three laws
will be submitted to the government before the end of July,'' Ryaas
told the Post.
	   ``We meet three days a week, from Friday to Sunday, to complete
the drafts,'' he said.
	   The team members, all with backgrounds in political sciences,
are Afan Gaffar of the Yogyakarta-based Gadjah Mada university,
Ramlan Surbakti of the Surabaya-based Airlangga University, Alfian
Malawange of the Ujungpandang-based Hasanuddin university in South
Sulawesi, Johermansyah Johan and Lutfi of IIP and Anas Urbaningrum,
chairman of the Indonesian Moslem Students Association and a
postgraduate student at the University of Indonesia.

World Cup: Baggio penalty earns 2-2 tie for Italy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recasts, UPDATES with, Baggio, Chile quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ This Roberto Baggio spot kick was spot
on.
	   The veteran striker, in just his fourth appearance for Italy
since his wayward shootout kick ended the 1994 World Cup, hit a
penalty with six minutes left Thursday to salvage a 2-2 draw with
Chile in the France '98 opener for both teams.
	   ``Certainly I thought of four years ago, but then I told myself
I was going to put the ball into the net this time,'' Baggio said.
``Luckily I did.''
	   With his first World Cup penalty since that dramatic miss in
Pasadena, he cooly slotted the ball between 'keeper Nelson Tapia
and the left post. It was controversially awarded when Ronald
Fuentes failed to get his right arm out of the way of a Baggio
cross.
	   Chile had led 2-1 thanks to two stunning strikes by Marcelo
Salas after Christian Vieri had given Italy a 10th-minute lead off
a Baggio assist.
	   The 31-year-old, in the starting lineup only because Alessandro
Del Piero was out injured, said he did not feel any fear as he
prepared to take the kick.
	   ``We risked to win in the final minutes, after risking to lose.
As expected the first World Cup match was difficult and we suffered
throughout against a team which played very well today,'' said
Baggio.
	   Fuentes disputed the penalty call.
	   ``I did not try to stop the ball with my hand. The ball came to
me,'' he said. ``I am very sad because of the effort my teammates
made. We deserved to win.''
	   The dubious penalty touched off irate boos and jeers from the
Chileans among the 31,800 at Bordeaux Lescure stadium.
	   ``The shot was not too strong, but it was well placed,'' said
Tapia, who appeared to get the tips of his fingers on Baggio's
penalty. ``If I commit 1/100th of a second earlier I stop that
shot.''
	   Italy, playing in all-white, took the early lead with a stunning
counter-attack after Ivan Zamorano, Baggio's teammate at Inter
Milan next season, lost possession deep in the Italian half.
	   Vieri and Baggio were well advanced with only two Chilean
defenders between them and the goal, and the 1994 World Cup star
collected a long through ball from Paolo Maldini.
	   Instead of heading for goal, Baggio turned playmaker,
unselfishly slipping the ball sideways to the better positioned
Vieri, who left-footed it home from 15 yards (meters).
	   Chile, aiming to make the second round for only the second time
in seven attempts, came back into the game strongly and tied the
score in the third minute of first half injury time.
	   Fabian Estay swung in a left-wing corner kick, Zamorano powered
in a header, Pedro Reyes touched the ball on and Salas turned to
fire the ball home with his left foot.
	   Four minutes into the second half, Salas struck again, climbing
to a right wing cross by Clarence Acuna, beating Fabio Cannavaro in
the air and powering in a header.
	   ``He's a very dangerous forward, difficult to mark,'' Alessandro
Nesta said of Salas, who joins the defender at Lazio of Rome in
September.
	   Zamorano, who combined with Salas in scoring Chile's 23 World
Cup qualifying goals, moved throughout the attack front and proved
almost unbeatable in aerial play.
	   ``It could have been better to start with a win,'' Paolo Maldini
said, ``but we had considered the possibility of a draw in one of
the three first-group matches. Now we will have to beat Cameroon''
next Wednesday.
	   Lineups:
	   Italy _ Gianluca Pagliuca; Alessandro Nesta, Paolo Maldini,
Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Costacurta, Dino Baggio, Angelo Di
Livio (Enrico Chiesa, 61st), Demetrio Albertini, Roberto Di Matteo
(Luigi Di Biagio, 58th), Christian Vieri (Filippo Inzaghi, 71st),

(Miguel Ramirez, 64th), Moises Villarroel, Francisco Rojas, Nelson
Parraguez, Clarence Acuna (Fernando Cornejo, 82nd), Fabian Estay

	   President B.J. Habibie signed release papers yesterday for 16
young activists, including 15 East Timorese prisoners and
detainees, Minister of Justice Muladi said.
	   The President, through decree No. 85 dated yesterday, granted
amnesty to eight political prisoners sentenced by the courts for
their involvement in antigovernment protests, and dropped charges
against eight East Timorese political detainees.
	   They are all expected to be released today.
	   Seven of the eight prisoners are Timorese. They are: Cancio
Antoni H.G., Bendito Amaral, Thomas Agusto Coreia, Hermenegildo
Dacosta, Jose Gomes, Luis Pereira and Antonio Gusmao Freitas.
	   They are serving prison terms in East Timor.
	   The eighth is Coky Aritonang.
	   ``Coky is now serving his sentence in Magelang prison and was
sentenced for insulting former president Soeharto,'' Muladi said
after meeting with Habibie at Bina Graha presidential office.
	   Meanwhile, the eight detainees whose charges were dropped are
Juvinal Dos Santos Monis, Fransisco de Deus, Domingos Da Silva,
Silverio Babtista Ximenes, Vicente Marques Da Crus, Bernadino
Simao, Paulo Silva Carvalho and Paulo Soares.
	   Just one week after replacing Soeharto in May, Habibie released
four political prisoners including labor activist Muchtar Pakpahan
and Soeharto's strong critic Sri Bintang Pamungkas.
	   He also freed Nuku Suleiman, chairman of human rights group
Pijar Foundation, and Andi Syahputra, an activist from the Alliance
of Independent Journalist (AJI).
	   Habibie also dropped charges against Karlina Leksono, Gadis
Arivia Effendi and Wilasih Noviana from the Voice of Concerned
Mothers. They were taken to court for staging a street rally
without police permission.
	   ``An interdepartment team is now conducting a comprehensive
study on all the other political detainees and prisoners,'' Muladi
said.
	   According to his records, there are at least 150 political
prisoners and detainees throughout the country.
	   As a follow-up to his pledge to improve the country's human
rights record, the President will ratify next week two United
Nations conventions on antitorture and on antirace discrimination.
	   ``I think this is very good for us in facing the future,'' said
the minister.
	   So far the government has been firmly against the release of
Timorese separatist leader Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao, whom
the government claims was sentenced on criminal charges, not
political ones.

	   An ethnic Chinese Moslem foundation, Haji Karim Oei, expressed
concern here yesterday over the recent establishment of a Chinese
political party, fearing that such an ethnic-based party would only
aggravate animosity toward those of Chinese descent.
	   In a statement read at a news conference by deputy chairman H.M.
Ali Karim, the foundation maintained that such political parties
were ``not in line with the spirit of 1928's Youth Pledge''.
	   Ali was referring to the historic youths oath of 1928 when
nationalist youths laid the foundation of nationhood by declaring
themselves to be of ``one motherland, one nation and one language:
Indonesia''.
	   ``The foundation followed with deep concern the establishment of
political organizations that are based on ethnicity and ancestry...
Such a political organization is established simply out of
emotion,'' Ali said.
	   Bambang Wiwoho, a nonethnic Chinese who is secretary-general of
the foundation, said he was disturbed about any possible
repercussions which the establishment of the party may cause.
	   ``It's not right to fight for our aspirations in an exclusive
manner,'' Bambang remarked.
	   Also attending the occasion was well-known soothsayer and
astrologer Putri Wong Kam Fu alias Leoni Fatima, who said: ``It
(the establishment of the party) was not the correct time to do
so''.
	   Wong, who is also a member of the foundation, did not say when
she believed the ``correct time'' would be, but was convinced that
the presence of an ethnic Chinese political party would bear
``harmful repercussions'' to most ethnic Chinese who know nothing
of politics.
	   The news conference was held yesterday in direct response to the
establishment of the Chinese-Indonesian Reform Party (Parti) on
June 5, the first ethnic-based political party to emerge in the
current atmosphere of openness sweeping the country.
	   ``We want to defend our rights and create true harmony among
Indonesian citizens,'' said one of Parti's founders, Ponijan --
director of the Widyatara language school -- during the launching
of the party.
	   Ponijan said the party would demand that the government start
treating citizens of Chinese descent fairly in political, economic,
social and legal matters.
	   ``The government has so far discriminated against us. It, for
instance, (uses a code to) differentiate us on our identity
cards,'' Ponijan asserted.
	   Yesterday, Wong charged that the party founders should have
consulted with leading ethnic Chinese figures before using the word
Tionghoa (Chinese) in the name of its party,
	   ``If anything goes wrong with such a party, won't it be all
Chinese who bear the brunt?'' Wong asked.
	   The ethnic Chinese minority has often become a target during
various upheavals in the country, largely because it dominates the
economy.
	   Last month, hundreds of Chinese shops were among those targeted
by looters and arsonists during the riots here which saw over 5,000
buildings damaged or burned.
	   But with the new government pledging democratic reform, a small
coalition of ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs said that now was the
time to take to the political stage.
	   Chinese-Indonesians make up only about 4 percent of the
country's 202 million population.

	   THE ThinkPad notebook computer from International Business
Machines Corp has been in the market for quite some time now. It's
common nowadays to see a business professional sitting down at a
corner in a hotel lobby, operating his notebook, oblivious to the
people around him.
	   The ThinkPad is an impressive portable tool. Over the years, IBM
has managed to incorporate innovative technologies into this sleek
machine, making it one of the better products in the market.
	   There are a few models available in the ThinkPad series. An
addition to the series is the ThinkPad 380XD which is actually not
an entirely new product. The significant feature that
differentiates ThinkPad 380XD from other previous models is its
all-in-one drive.
	   However, this is not something very new as several notebook
manufacturers have already introduced the feature.
	   There are many modular designed notebooks and sub-notebooks
which allow us to swap the drive component from compact disk (CD)
to floppy, or hook an additional drive for the subs. But in the
ThinkPad 380XD, everything is integrated, including the CD, floppy
and hard disk.
	   This means that you don't have to carry around your CD drive and
swap it with your floppy drive when the need arises. In other
words, you don't have to lug around extra weight, or worry about
leaving a drive behind.
	   The bundled drives include a four-gigabyte (GB) hard disk,
3.5-inch internal diskette drive and a 10-speed CD-ROM drive. The
three drives are stacked up on one another on the right side of the
notebook.
	   The ThinkPad 380XD is configured with a 233-megahertz (MHz)
Intel Pentium processor with MMX technology, 4GB of S.M.A.R.T. hard
drive and a standard 32-megabyte random access memory (RAM)
expandable to 96MB with 512KB Level 2 (L2) cache, which promises
satisfactory multimedia performance for its compact casing.
	   Its sight capability is projected through the 12.1-inch
thin-film transistor (TFT) screen that is able to support 16
million colours of 800 by 600 resolution. To ensure satisfactory
video presentations, the motion picture experts group (MPEG) 1
support is incorporated with peripheral component interconnect
(PCI) bus enhancement.
	   The ThinkPad 380XD is designed with Sound Blaster Pro support,
integrated stereo speakers located in front of the notebook and a
microphone. At the back of the notebook are two serial ports; one
is parallel and the other is universal serial bus (USB).
	   A PS/2 port is available together with an extension for the
optional Port Replicator to deliver impressive performance in the
office or on the road.
	   On the left-hand side, you will find the headphone and
microphone jacks, volume control, the personal computer memory card
international association (PCMCIA) slot and the battery.
	   Like most notebook designs, the light emitting diodes (LEDs) are
located on top of the keyboard for displaying the notebook status.
Its rather novel input device, the red accupoint, can be found
in-between the keys.
	   The brightness control for the screen is beside the screen
itself.
	   Other than the pre-loaded Windows 95 operating system, users
will be given Lotus SmartSuite application as a bonus offering.
	   For more information on IBM bundled software, a ThinkPad
Software Select is available on the notebook. This feature is,
however, shipped uninstalled on the new ThinkPad.
	   These applications which will assist users in administering and
managing their systems are listed on the left-hand frame of this
page.
	   The software included are IBM AntiVirus, IBM Client Services for
Netfinity, Intel LANDesk Client Manager and Tivoli TME10
Lightweight Client Framework.
	   The ThinkPad 380XD is powered by a lithium-ion battery which is
said to last about three-and-a-half to four-and-a-half hours.
	   This model also comes standard with a one-year international
limited warranty.

	   Minister of Food and Horticulture AM Saefuddin said yesterday
the country would import 1.3 million metric tons of sugar and 0.7
million tons of soybeans this year to make up for shortages on the
domestic market.
	   He said the domestic sugar output was estimated to fall 14.3
percent to 1.8 tons this year, much lower than demand expected to
reach about 3.1 tons.
	   ``The 1.3 ton sugar imports will include 0.4 tons for the
industrial sector and 0.9 tons for the public's consumption,''
Saefuddin said at a hearing with House of Representatives'
Commission III for agriculture, transmigration, forestry and food
affairs.
	   The country would import 0.7 million tons of soybeans this year
as domestic production would be about 1.47 million tons while
demand might reach 2.17 million tons.
	   The government will import 0.3 million tons of soybeans from the
United States this year, using the GSM-102 export credit guarantees
provided by the country, and another 110,000 tons from China, he
said.
	   Despite the imports, there would still be a deficit of about
290,000 tons. The government will maximize the country's soybean
production to fill the shortages, the minister said.
	   Saefuddin also said the country's crude palm oil (CPO) output
would reach 5.98 tons this year, as against the domestic CPO demand
of 2.93 tons which is equal to 2.35 tons of cooking oil.
	   The minister warned that the cooking oil supply to the domestic
market could still be disturbed because producers still preferred
to export their products due to higher prices on the international
market despite a 40 percent export tax.
	   CPO now sells for US$660 per ton free on board for exports,
compared with the domestic price of less than Rp 3,500 per ton.
	   He said the government ``will maintain the CPO export tax at
between 35 percent and 40 percent'' to stop the drives for export.
	   Saefuddin also said the country's rice output for this year was
expected to drop by 2.15 percent to 31.2 million tons. This would
force the country to conduct rice imports.
	   He did not specify the volume of the rice imports but the State
Logistics Agency (Bulog) earlier it would reach 3.1 million tons.
	   The El Nino weather pattern which battered the country from the
middle of last year until early this year has caused drought and
failed rice harvests in many parts of the country.
	   Saefuddin said there was no concern about the supply of
vegetables and fruits for the domestic market as the country's
trade balance showed an average annual surplus of 36,800 tons for
fruits and 82,700 tons for vegetables.
	   He noted that national fruit and vegetable consumption reached
only 24.6 kilograms per capita a year in 1996, lower than the
standard set by the Food Agricultural Organization, which is 60 kg
per capita a year for fruits and 65.75 kg per capita a year for
vegetables.

	   SOAP gaming has arrived. Arvin, an Italian company, has launched
a game which is available in instalments. The first two levels of
Save the Earth can be downloaded for free over the Internet.
Players who find themselves hooked are then asked to pay for each
new level, which arrives every month. The game itself is an action
adventure with an environmentally sound plot. Those interested can
look up an English language version available at
http://members.xoom.com/cavern/soft.htm.
	   Meanwhile, a new version of the addictive shooter Tempest is
ready to launch. Veteran coder Jeff Minter is planning to unveil
Tempest 3000 for the secret new format Project X this month.
Tempest has been knocking around for about 15 years and has turned
up on just about every format imaginable. The game involves moving
around a three-dimensional cage, while firing at a series of
attacking beasties. It can be best described as the Tetris of
shooters.

	   Minister of Mines and Energy Kuntoro Mangkusubroto said he would
abolish the monopoly given to PT EL Nusa for the maintenance of the
state oil and gas company Pertamina's refineries.
	   ``If necessary, (I will order) Pertamina to let go of the
company,'' Kuntoro said Tuesday at a hearing with the House of
Representatives Commission V for industry, mining, trade, manpower,
cooperatives and the environment.
	   Kuntoro said all future contracts with Pertamina would have to
be made through tenders in order to select bidders with the lowest
price offer.
	   El Nusa is 51.5 percent owned by Pertamina and 48.5 percent by
PT Tridaya Esta, which is controlled by ex-president Soeharto's son
Bambang Trihatmodjo and legislator Indra Bambang Utoyo.
	   Although El Nusa is engaged in oil and gas exploration and
production, telecommunications, oil refineries, oil product retail
and infrastructure development, the maintenance of the refineries
generate most of its revenues.
	   The company has enjoyed monopolies in other Pertamina operations
on top of its refinery monopoly.
	   Pertamina currently runs nine refineries located in Pangkalan
Brandan, North Sumatra; Dumai and Sungai Pakning, Riau; Musi, South
Sumatra; Balongan, West Java; Cilacap and Cepu, Central Java;
Balikpapan, East Kalimantan; and Kasim, Irian Jaya.
	   El Nusa president Aswad Dipo recently told The Jakarta Post the
company enjoyed Rp 170 billion in annual revenues from the
maintenance of the refineries.
	   The company is considered one of Pertamina's best-performing
subsidiaries and plans to go public this year.
	   El Nusa is also among seven companies which hold exclusive
trading rights for the high-octane Premix and Super TT gasolines
sold domestically.
	   The other traders are Gigantrax, Sinar Pedoman Abadi, Hiswana
Migas Cooperative, Bhakti Migas Utama, Humpuss Trading and Panutan
Selaras.
	   Humpuss Trading is controlled by Soeharto's son Hutomo Mandala
Putra, alias Tommy, while PT Panutan Selaras is a subsidiary of the
Panutan Group, chaired by Soeharto's eldest son Sigit Harjojudanto.

	   In places like urban Manila, a house blessing is but a simple
ceremony of short prayer and sprinkling of holy water around and
inside the house by a priest or a minister, after which coins are
thrown to imbibe good luck, prosperity, and happiness.
	   However, an Ifugao house blessing amidst the mountain slopes of
the Mountain Province is that simple. A special ritual ``hogop che
phaley'' (or ``hogop che bale'' in Kiangan) is performed by a
tribal priest called ``mumfoni'' (or ``mumbaki'' in Kiangan). As
part of the ritual, two pigs and four chicken are butchered for the
occasion, or there will be no peace, happiness, and prosperity for
the house's inhabitants.
	   Consequently, the National Museum, which recently acquired an
authentic Ifugao House, was not spared from the rigors of this
ritual. Although a ``paladja'' ritual had been initially conducted
during the dismantling of the house for its transfer to Manila, a
``hogop che phaley'' had to be performed after it was
reconstructed.
	   According to museum anthropologists, it was ``to imbibe good
vibrations in its new site.''
	   The ``hogop che phaley'' ritual was conducted lst May 20 by a
``mumfoni'' who traveled from the Mt. Province to Manila. He was
assisted by members of his ethnic community who butchered and
cooked the ceremonial animals and offered wine to the guests as
part of the ritual.
	   The newly acquired Ifugao house is a Mayaoyao type, and is made
of wood, rattan, cogon, and reeds. It is one of the main
attractions of the Museum of the Filipino People to be formally
opened by Pres. and Mrs. Fidel V.
	   Ramos today in time for the Centennial celebration of the
Philippine Independence.
	   The ceremonies, made possible through the generous assistance of
the Presidential Committee to Assist the National Museum (PCANM),
will be held at the quadrangle of the Old Finance Building where
the Ifugao House will be permanently installed. Other Ifugao
material culture, such as baskets, textile, and subsistence
paraphernalia, will also be displayed to complement the Ifugao
house.

	   WHEN the World Cup '98 tournament kicks off in Paris this week,
there will be as much pressure on the companies providing
technology support as there is on the football teams.
	   If the technology fails in any significant way, billions will be
on hand to watch - with many more looking at the World Cup Web
sites all over the Net to catch the latest challenge.
	   Web site experience with the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, US,
and the recent Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, has shown that it
can be dangerous to underestimate the demand for.
	   At World Cup '98, it is the turn of Hewlett-Packard, database
software company Sybase, consulting and services firm EDS and
France Telecom to take up the challenge. Organisers have designed
the official World Cup site (http://www.france98.com) to deal with
several million visits every day during the competition through
four mirror sites (Paris, Texas, Virginia and California).
	   These are exact copies of the main site designed to take the
traffic load from any single Web site location. There's a lot at
stake and the price for mistakes would be high.
	   ``This is truly mission-critical computing. There is no room for
error - all the systems have to be totally and uncompromisingly
available and 100 per cent operational,'' says HP's enterprise
computing marketing manager Lynn Anderson.

	   ADIGRAT, Ethiopia (AP) _ Eritrean aircraft on Thursday dropped
eight bombs on this northeastern Ethiopian border town, killing
four people, wounding more than 30 and leaving residents shocked
and defiant.
	   ``We are suffering and very angry,'' said Meheret Sisaha, as she
sat with her forehead bandaged on a mattress in the hallway of the
local hospital.
	   ``If I get well, I will go and join the army and I am going to
fight to the very end,'' she said, waving a fist in the air. She
said she was wounded when she ran outside to check on her
8-year-old son when she heard aircraft approaching; the boy was
later found unharmed.
	   All four of those killed were men who were among the crowd at
the grain warehouses of the local Disaster Prevention Stock and
Relief Society. Poor people come there daily to receive rations.
	   The casualty toll came from Emmanuel Gesese, a doctor at the
local hospital where the victims lay on cots with bloodstained
sheets in halls that echoed wih cries.
	   ``I am sad to get such a bombardment from the Eritrean
government. They are our brothers,'' Gesese said, adding ``we are
not going to be frightened. We are going to get stronger and
stronger.''
	   The first two bombs were dropped from a helicopter at 5:20 p.m.
(1420 GMT) near an army base, but they apparently failed to hit
anything.
	   Jet fighters dropped four more on the mountains surrounding the
town, and two on the combined industrial-residential area where the
warehouses are located in the town of about 40,000 inhabitants.
	   The bombs set the warehouses afire; they were still burning some
four hours after the attack. An estimated two tons of grain was
destroyed.
	   The attack occurred on the same day that both Ethiopia and
Eritrea said fighting had broken out on the border near Eritrea's
Red Sea port of Assab.
	   Since May 6, the two countries in the Horn of Africa have been
fighting for control of territory along at least four different
points on their common border.
	   Adigrat is 125 kilometers (78 miles) south of the Eritrean
capital, Asmara, and about 25 kilometers (15 miles) south of the
border.

	   THE biggest star at the recent Electronic Entertainment Expo
(E3) in Atlanta, US, was actress Gillian Anderson, the FBI agent
Scully in The X- Files. She was present to promote Fox
Interactive's spin-off game which also stars actor David Duchovny,
better known as agent Mulder.
	   Anderson confessed to a lapsed love of computer games. ``Years
ago, I played Tetris, Tortured Souls and Myst. Just a bit though. I
am terrified of delving into some other reality that I am not able
to come out of and forgetting I am a mother with responsibilities
in my life,'' she says. ``I have requested a lot of CD-ROMs -
educational, dictionaries and encylopaedia. They are there when I
have some time.''

	   IMF Asia Pacific director Hubert Neiss said yesterday he
expected the agency to disburse its second US$1 billion bailout
money to Indonesia next month.
	   ``It could be mid July, or early July. It depends on how quickly
we finish here,'' he told reporters upon arrival here yesterday
afternoon.
	   The IMF has committed to provide $10 billion as part of a $43
billion bailout fund for Indonesia. The agency has so far disbursed
$4 billion.
	   The second $1 billion disbursement was initially scheduled for
June 4, but was delayed due to the country's recent political
unrest.
	   Neiss arrived in Jakarta to lead the IMF technical team to
review the country's economic reform programs agreed upon with the
fund in April.
	   This is Neiss' second visit to Jakarta in 10 days.
	   His last visit, during which the IMF Asia director met a
veritable who's who of the Indonesian establishment including
government members, prominent opposition leaders, even trade
unionists, was designed to help the board of the IMF decide when it
could resume lending to the beleaguered country.
	   Chairman of the National Development Planning Board (Bappenas)
Budiono earlier said the IMF team would not focus on reviewing the
structural reform since most of the programs had been implemented.
	   He pointed out that tomorrow's discussion would center on
reviewing the country's macroeconomic targets, state budget and
social safety net program.
	   He was optimistic the IMF would make the second disbursement
because the country had met all the agency's criteria.
	   Indonesia's macroeconomic picture has dramatically changed since
the economic reform program was agreed upon earlier this year. The
current situation has deteriorated following the political turmoil.
	   Analysts said the economy would contract by more than 10 percent
this year with inflation surpassing 100 percent and unemployment to
reach 20 million.
	   They also the earlier year-end target of the rupiah exchange
rate of Rp 6,000 to the U.S. dollar was no longer realistic.
	   The rupiah yesterday closed at Rp 12,000 to the dollar, compared
to about Rp 8,000 when the reform program was agreed in April.

Ignacio, Jr. in a report to President Fidel V. Ramos said that six
government agencies have agreed to implement a short and long-term
strategies to address the problem.
	   More than 800,000 families have been affected by the drought and
food shortage in Mindanao particularly in Cotabato and Saranggani.
	   The National Food Authority (NFA), one of the agencies involved
in the food planning, will offer a rice loan package to be funded
through local government units' Internal Revenue Allotment or IRA.
	   Government is also eyeing a rice subsidy program wherein
beneficiaries may purchase two kilos of rice daily for low prices.
	   Aside from NFA, the other agencies involved in the Mindanao food
program are the Department of Social Welfare and Development,
Department of National Defense, Department of Interior and Local
Government, Department of Public Works and Highways, Department of
Labor and Employment, and the Department of Science and Technology.

	   The country's largest automaker, Astra International, reshuffled
its management yesterday and announced a temporary halt in
production due to lack of orders.
	   Somalia Wiria, a former top executive of Bank Negara Indonesia,
was named the company's chief commissioner, replacing former
minister of trade and industry Mohammad ``Bob'' Hasan.
	   Rini M. Soewandi, formerly finance director, was promoted to
president, replacing Theodore Permadi Rachmat.
	   Rachmat was named a member of the supervisory board.
	   Astra spokesman Aminuddin said yesterday that Hasan, a timber
baron and longtime ally of former president Soeharto, resigned from
the chief commissioner's post when he was appointed minister in
March.
	   President B.J. Habibie assigned Rahardi Ramelan to take over
Hasan's ministerial post last month after Soeharto resigned.
	   Hasan chaired the publicly listed Astra International last year
as the representative of Nusamba, which owns a 10 percent stake in
the company.
	   Diversified Nusamba is owned by foundations affiliated with
Soeharto.
	   Rachmat said yesterday he resigned to allow fresh input from
younger and more qualified people to lead the company.
	   ``After 14 years at the helm of Astra, it is now time for
younger people like Rini Soewandi who is more competent than I am
to lead Astra.
	   ``Besides, Astra is facing a difficult time in the years
ahead.''
	   Rini said yesterday that the company had halted its production
activities since early this month due to a decline in sales in the
automotive division.
	   ``It is really a difficult time for us and this is a challenging
job for us,' she said after the company's shareholders meeting.
	   Reports said previously that the company's automotive division,
which produces Toyota, Daihatsu, Isuze, BMW, Peugeot and Nissan
automobiles, sold only 15,134 vehicles in the first three months of
this year, down 63 percent from 41,602 in the same period of 1997.
	   Sales of motorcycles dropped 49.7 percent to 96,396 vehicles in
the first three months, from 191,626 in the same period last year.
	   Rini said the company would have to introduce cost-cutting
measures, halt production activities and seek new export
opportunities to offset the decline in domestic sales.
	   ``We will boost exports of engines, car components and the new
Kijang model to neighboring countries like Malaysia and the
Philippines.''
	   Rini said the company's total consolidated foreign debt was US$2
billion as of March this year, 70 percent of which was hedged.
	   The company was committed to servicing its interest payments,
she added.
	   Further losses
	   But if the rupiah remained weak against the U.S. dollar in the
months ahead, Rini warned the company might face further losses on
the unhedged portion of its dollar-denominated debts.
	   ``The first quarter loss was a translation loss of the rupiah's
weakness from the end of December to March. If at the end of June
the exchange rate is bad, then the translation loss will be
higher.''
	   Astra recorded a net loss of Rp 2.26 trillion in first quarter
of this year, reflecting the rupiah's depreciation from Rp 2,419
against the U.S. dollar in March 1997 to Rp 8,325 at the end of
March of this year.
	   Currently, the rupiah is hovering at about Rp 12,900.
	   Rini said the company was expected to post further losses this
year due to the deteriorating economic situation.
	   But she said that although Astra had a large foreign debt, it
would not join the newly established Indonesian Debt Restructuring
Agency (INDRA) to reschedule its debts because the company was
still engaged in serious discussions with foreign creditors to
reschedule its debts, mostly with Japanese banks.
	   ``Our creditors have understood our position. We have a very
long relationship with most of our creditors,'' she said.
	   The government set up INDRA last week after deciding upon a
framework to handle up to $60 billion of the country's mounting
private overseas debt.
	   Yesterday meeting also approved the retention of Abdul Rachman
Ramly, the former president of state oil and gas company Pertamina,
as vice chief commissioner, Anthony Salim, Usman Admadjaja,
Torstein Stephansen, Benjamin Arman Suriadjaya and Mikio Nomura as
commissioners. It appointed Benny Subianto as a new commissioner to
replace Prajogo Pangestu.
	   The meeting also approved Budi Setiadharma as the new vice
president and appointed Rudyanto Hardjanto, Himawan Surya, Michael
Dharmawan Ruslim, Danny Bonifasius Walla, Hagianto Kumala and Dorys
Setiawati Herlambang as directors.
	   Astra's share price shed Rp 50 to Rp 975 yesterday. Copyright

	   The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a permit
to Family First Inc., the direct marketing arm of Berkley
International Plans Inc., to sell P500 million worth of educational
plans in the Philippines.
	   The Family First Education Plan may be used for college,
vocational, masteral and doctoral courses. It allows planholders to
take spot cash or receive annual and semestral payments over a
four- or five-year course of study. Planholders also have the
option to leave their funds with the company to accumulate an
interest of 10% per annum until the last year of availment.
	   In addition to its permit, the SEC also certified Family First
as a general agent of Berkley International Plans Inc.
	   The Family First Education Plan is product of Berkley
International Plans Inc., a local subsidiary of Berkley
International LLC.
	   Berkley International LLC is a global insurance and financial
services company formed through a strategic joint venture of
US-based W.R. Berkley Corp. and Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance.
For its Philippine operations, the company entered into an alliance
with Equitable Banking Corp. to form Berkley International Plans
Inc.
	   Fil-Estate Opens First Sales Office in the US The Fil-Estate
Group recently opened its first real estate marketing office in the
US to tap the vast Filipino-American market.
	   Located at 21250 Hawthorne Boulevard, Suite 500 Torrance,
California 90503, the newly-inaugurated office which principally
caters to Filipino expatriates in the South Bay Area was
specifically chosen because of its proximity to Carson City.
	   The Torrance branch is just the first of several offices
Fil-Estate is planning to open in the US. Within two months,
another Fil-Estate office will open in the city of Glendale which
will cater to the San Fernando Valley Area. In addition, a third
office opens in Daly City, San Francisco within the next four
months.
	   Fil-Estate Land Inc. Vice-Chair Noel M. Carino spearheaded the
opening of the Torrance office, having gone there specifically for
that purpose. This move by Fil-Estate is a response to the present
economic climate the Philippines and the whole of Asia is currently
experiencing.
	   ''In 1984-85, when the Philippines was gripped by unstable and
somewhat chaotic political and economic conditions, Fil-Estate also
went overseas and established an office in Saudi Arabia to tap the
then overwhelming number of Filipino contract workers there, and it
was a big success,'' Carino recalled.
	   ''This year, we are repeating history by tapping our very own
kababayans in the US to encourage them to take a closer look at
their homeland once again, specifically at some of Fil-Estate's
projects that we believe they will find are very much at par or
probably even better than some of the communities they have there,
especially with the sizable discount we are offering exclusively
for Filipino expats,'' Carino adds.
	   To date, Carino reports that a lot of Filipinos in the US,
brokers especially, have already signified interest in joining the
company to help in the widespread campaign of Fil-Estate projects
among the Filipino communities.
	   Seminars on Fil-Estate and its projects have been scheduled on
June 19, 24, and 29.
	   MFI Scholars' Day Meralco Foundation Inc. (MFI) scholars for
schoolyear 1998-99 will be honored and presented to the
Foundation's Board of Trustees during the 16th Scholars' Day rites
to be held at the Meralco Theater on June 17 starting at 1:30 p.m.
	   A celebration of Holy Mass will precede the program proper.
	   More than 1,000 scholars are expected to join the affair. Mostly
are coming all the way from the provinces where MFI's
partner-institutions are based, among them: Balete Family Farm
School for Girls in Batangas; Jala-Jala Family School for Boys in
Rizal; Columbian Industrial Technological Center in Olongapo City;
Don Bosco Technical College in Mandaluyong City, and Meralco
Foundation Institute main campus in Ortigas, Pasig City.
	   Theme of this year's Scholars' Day is: ``Celebrating Freedom
Through Renewed Commitment to Excellence in Education.''
	   Students who excelled academically during the last schoolyear
will be awarded medals. Industrial partners who absorbed MFI
scholars for OJT (on-the-job training) and other forms of support
will be awarded plaques of appreciation.
	   MFI scholars are considered industrial technicians when they
graduate. With their specialized skills, they can understand better
the requirements of an engineering job. This enables them to render
proper technical judgment and work out effective systems that
complement the responsibilities of the engineer and laborer, making
them ideal supervisors in the future.
	   The three-year scholarship grant qualifies the students for free
tuition, free books, laboratory materials, calculator, uniform and
supplies.
	   Courses offered are electrical, electronics, instrumentation and
tool and dye technology. MFI scholars are 90% employed even before
they graduate.

	   THE ability to print on demand may give some books a new lease
of life.
	   Out-of-print books or specialised books are often ignored by
publishers because the cost of printing them far outweighs any
potential revenue. But through the Web, such books can be stored
digitally until a customer browses the site, selects a book, reads
it and places an order. The book is then printed and shipped.
``Books can be printed and inventoried in quantities of 50 to
several hundreds,'' says Scott Lubeck of Electric Press. ``For a
slightly higher unit price, a publisher may elect to print the
books on demand in quantities of one.
	   Technology such as Xerox's DocuColor printers also allows
customisation of books. This is particularly useful in the
education market, where students may need one chapter and not the
whole book.

Bangladesh's budget imposes no new taxes

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladesh's budget for 1998-99 on
Thursday spared people of fresh taxes but depended heavily on
foreign loans and grants.
	   The country's annual development plan of dlrs 2,960 million will
be financed up to 56 per cent by foreign assistance and 44 per cent
through its own resources, Finance Minister Shah Mohammad Kibria
told Parliament.
	   Defense spending goes up 13.38 percent from 1997-1998 with the
150,000-strong armed forces getting dlrs 600 million. Some dlrs 990
million goes to education.
	   The inflation rate jumped to 6.28 percent during 1997-98 as
against 2.51 percent in the previous year.
	   Kibria said the country's trade deficit came down by 24.9
percent to dlrs one billion during the first half of 1997-98.
Bangladesh's financial year starts on July one and ends on June 30.

	   A wedding date has been set for Yadi, 37, and his fiancee,
Yunyun. Yadi rushed to nearby jewelry stores to buy a pair of
24-karat gold rings. But he had difficulty finding them.
	   Only after days of exhaustive roaming around and explaining to a
jewelry store owner that he was about to wed and was desperate to
buy two gold wedding rings, did he find what he was looking for at
a remarkably high price -- Rp 45,000 per gram.
	   That was late last year, when the economic crisis had already
set in. Earlier last year gold sold for about Rp 23,000 a gram.
	   Months later, as the young married couple started looking for a
house to live in, they sold their wedding rings. ``We did it not
because we wanted to, but because someone came to us and offered us
a very good price for the rings. We were tempted. Besides, we
needed cash for a down payment on a house,'' Yunyun, who was five
months pregnant at the time, said.
	   The couple sold the gold rings for Rp 72,000 per gram.
	   Attracted by the high price, their mother-in-law, sisters and
aunts followed suit in selling their jewelry. They put together
necklaces, earring, bracelets. ``It all becomes more or less 100
grams. Now we don't have any gold accessories,'' said Sarah,
Yunyun's mother.
	   Sarah's family is not the only family to sell off their gold.
	   In their neighborhood, Cicalengka, on the eastern outskirts of
Bandung, all the gold has disappeared.
	   From time to time, gold becomes scarce and display cases in
jewelry stores are mostly void of gold accessories.
	   The gold is there, but because traders must comply with
standardized prices, they choose to hold onto their merchandise to
avoid losses caused by rising prices, which fluctuate in line with
the currency turmoil.
	   ``We are not allowed to sell our old stock at the latest price.
And if we sell it, we will not be able to get new stock because
prices have risen so much,'' a shop attendant at Kosambi business
center said.
	   So the only thing they can do is stop selling their gold, and
concentrate on buying secondhand jewelry.
	   Still, jewelry shop owners cannot just wait for sellers to come
to them because ``people think it's still safe to have precious
possessions in their house until someone knocks on their door and
offers a high price,'' said Au Tjung, a goldsmith.
	   So Tjung hires a number of people to go from door-to door-to buy
gold.
	   Normally, he offers a three-day contract to a gold buyer. The
contract value depends on how much gold the buyer is able to
secure. ``If someone says he can get one kilogram of 22-karat gold
within three days, we can give him something like Rp 45 million.''
	   But Tjung said the average value of contracts were between Rp 10
million and Rp 15 million ``because normally, one person is only
able to get 200 to 300 grams of gold in two or three days.''
	   Tjung's fellow goldsmiths work the same way. A gold shop owner
in Jamika, one of Bandung gold centers, said one jewelry store
could hire 10 to 13 men. ``There are at least 20 gold stores around
here, you can count yourself how many people are on contract,'' she
said.
	   A rough figure would be 2,500 jewelry stores in Bandung and its
outskirts.
	   A buyer's story
	   Because gold is getting scarce, buying gold door-to-door is
becoming an increasingly difficult job. Daud, a buyer on contract,
has a story to tell:
	   ``Once a friend of mine told me that somewhere in a far away
village, people kept high-quality gold. Some even had gold nuggets.
I rushed down to my financier and told him I could get a quarter
kilogram of gold within two days. I got a Rp 15 million contract.
	   ``I rented a car and crossed village by village, district by
district, down to Gunung Halu, a very remote place at the foot of a
mountain. It was twilight when I got there. How could I tell
whether people had gold that they were willing to sell?
	   ``I came by a small food stall, had some food and a cup of
coffee. While chewing my food, I fished for clues: 'Anyone around
here want to sell gold?' I asked the warung woman. 'Dunno, you want
to buy some?' she replied. 'Yeah,' I sighed.
	   ``After a pause, two old men came and ordered some tea. 'If
you're interested in selling any gold, this gentleman will buy,'
the women told the two men while pointing at me.
	   ``The men said they did not have gold, but they could help me
ask around whether people in the neighborhood would sell theirs. I
went from house to house with the two men. Deals were made. At
first, people, mostly women, seemed reluctant, but they soon
excitedly sold me their gold after I told them how much I was
offering.
	   ``That day, I got 200 grams of gold comprising necklaces, rings,
earrings and bracelets. I was astonished when several women offered
gold nuggets! Where did they get them? I was informed later that
they got them from Saudi Arabia. The women were former maids who
worked in the Mideast.
	   ``I couldn't buy the nuggets because I didn't have enough
cash.''
	   Later, other gold buyers traced Daud's tracks and three weeks
after Daud arrived there, all gold accessories disappeared from the
remote district. ``There's no gold there anymore,'' said Maman, a
gold buyer who traveled to the remote area last month.
	   On a good day, gold buyers only earn enough to make ends meet.
``Commonly, we pick up a Rp 1,500 to Rp 2,000 profit margin per
gram in buying and selling prices. If we can get 200 grams in our
contract terms, we earn Rp 300,000 to Rp 400,000. In times of
economic hardship like now, that's good money,'' gold buyer Maman
said.
	   But working as a gold buyer on contract is only moonlighting.
The buyers are originally clothes vendors in traditional markets,
ojek (motorcycle taxi) drivers or carpenters who live near jewelry
stores whose owners act as fund managers. So the financiers know
them well and vice versa, a relationship on which deals are based.
The gold buyers are armed with scales and testing stones.
	   Bad days
	   Days are not always bright for buyers, especially when gold
becomes scarce. ``The other day I had two days of hunting, combing
six housing complexes and narrow village tracks. And all for
nothing,'' Maman said, adding that he had to pay for his own car
rental and gasoline.
	   In jewelry stores, gold accessories are melted down into
nuggets. With documents that goldsmiths are authorized to issue,
the nuggets are sold overseas. It is the present slide in the
rupiah which gains them huge profits.
	   ``International gold prices actually remain stable. But since
our overseas buyers pay in dollars or other major currencies, we
gain enough profit because we change the currencies into rupiah,
with which we buy gold at home at lower prices,'' Tjung said.
	   When told that he was one of the few lucky ones to be blessed by
the economic crises, he just said: ``All we do is to try to survive
in business. We offer a living to our brothers by giving them
contracts to supply us with gold. Is there anything wrong with
that?''
	   No, not at all.

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Eritrean aircraft bombed an
Ethiopian town, and ground fighting flared on two fronts Thursday,
as Rwandan and U.S. officials returned to Ethiopia to promote a
peace plan.
	   Eritrean helicopters and warplanes dropped at least eight bombs
on the northeastern border town of Adigrat on Thursday evening. Two
of the bombs hit a combined industrial-residential area in the town
of 40,000, setting grain warehouses on fire.
	   Four people were killed and more than 30 wounded, said Emmanuel
Gesese, a doctor at the local hospital.
	   Adigrat is about 20 kilometers (12 miles) southwest of Zala
Ambessa, the border town captured by Eritrean forces last week.
	   Ground clashes broke out Thursday in the region of Eritrea's
crucial Red Sea port of Assab _ an area that had not seen previous
fighting _ and in the Yirga triangle area where the conflict began
May 6.
	   Eritrean rebels fought Ethiopia for 30 years to gain
independence. They succeeded in 1993, two years after helping
Ethiopian rebels under Meles Zenawi _ who is now prime minister _
oust a 17-year military dictatorship.
	   Rwandan Vice President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame, whose
country along with the United States has authored a peace plan,
returned to Addis Ababa on Thursday. There was no indication
whether the presence of Kagame, Rwanda's de facto leader, indicated
an advance in the plan's prospects.
	   Ethiopia has already voiced support for the plan, which calls
for Eritrea to pull back troops to the positions they held before
fighting broke out. Eritrea has said the plan needs more work, but
has not specified its objections.
	   Regional military sources say the plan calls for Rwanda to
supply peacekeepers to enforce demilitarization of the disputed
border regions.
	   Kagame and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice
vigorously shuttled during May to promote the plan. The U.S.
Embassy said the team in Addis Ababa does not include Rice but
declined to say who was on it.
	   Eritrean and Ethiopian troops fought Thursday along a road
surrounded by sand dunes at the border southwest of the Eritrean
port of Assab. That region is where landlocked Ethiopia's border
comes closest to the Red Sea, about 75 kilometers (45 miles) away.
	   As in the past, each side accused the other of provoking the
fight.
	   ``Ethiopia had been amassing troops in the area in preparation
for this attack,'' the Eritrean government said in a statement.
	   Fighting also was reported along the Badme-Shiraro front inside
the northwestern Yirga triangle region, a 400-square-kilometer
(160-square-mile) patch of disputed territory. Ethiopian government
spokeswoman Salome Tadesse said the fighting was at the Erde
Mattios military post.
	   She said Eritrean forces were repulsed and suffered heavy losses
in both attacks. But such claims have been standard by both sides,
and no reliable casualty counts have come out.
	   Thursday was the first time fighting had flared in the Assab
area. Ethiopia has boycotted the port, 650 kilometers (400 miles)
to the northeast of Addis Ababa since fighting broke out a month
ago.
	   Until the current border dispute erupted into fighting, Ethiopia
exported most of its coffee _ its chief foreign-currency earner _
through Assab. It now uses the port of Djibouti south of Assab on
the Gulf of Aden.

	   I would like to draw the attention of The Jakarta Post readers
to security arrangements in Gran Melia here in Jakarta.
	   On April 3, 1998, my mobile phone was stolen while I sat in the
lobby of that hotel reading a newspaper, so beware, do not relax at
Gran Melia Jakarta.
	   Once the theft came to my attention, no hotel security personnel
were available in the lobby to assist me and it took a considerable
time before the assistant manager came to see what had happened.
	   I was ushered into the security room, which was full of monitors
but devoid of security guards. The guard on duty had to be called
out of the changing room because he wanted to go home. What a
``five-star'' setup!
	   I dialed the number of my mobile phone and it rang. I then
suggested to security staff and the assistant manager that we try
this again to see if we could pinpoint the thief by the noise or if
he or she was tempted into answering it.
	   Nobody understood what I meant and all looked at me like I came
from another planet.
	   So, I duly filled out an accident report and left frustrated.
	   For the next three weeks I received no response from the hotel
management, so I phoned and spoke to the assistant manager again.
He apologized for not getting back to me because he had been on
vacation.
	   I lost my temper and demanded a written follow-up, which he
provided the same day. He told me he was sorry -- what more could
one expect.
	   It made me wonder what entitles an hotel to describe itself as a
five-star establishment and what its responsibilities regarding
hospitality, the promotion of tourism, and safety and security
actually are.
	   It seems that my complaints finally reached the general manager,
who then wrote me a letter.
	   Greetings from Gran Melia Jakarta, he said -- I thought he was
being sarcastic -- then, after offering his sincere apologies, said
the hotel was not responsible for this kind of accident.
	   I wonder how many other Gran Melia guests have had a similar
experience?

	   NETSCAPE Communications Corp has outlined a strategy to help
companies build, buy or outsource software and services over the
Internet. Netscape said the strategy is aimed at enabling the
company to compete successfully in what it called the new Net
Economy.
	   Fresh from having a good first financial quarter performance,
Netscape confidently announced that it has aligned its products,
services and people to assist companies in creating, managing and
leveraging technologies in new ways, regardless of physical
boundaries.
	   The company recorded a revenue of US$127 million (RM495 million)
for the period ended April 30.
	   Elaborating on the new strategy in San Francisco last week,
Netscape's president and chief executive officer Jim Barksdale said
companies could now create new customers while retaining the
current ones even more effectively.
	   He said by using Netscape's software and services, companies
could now act as enterprise service providers (ESPs) by delivering
core applications as online services to their constituents.
	   In announcing the Net Economy strategy, Netscape also revealed
that it intends to focus its core business on three primary areas.
	   The areas comprise helping businesses create a service-ready
infrastructure built on Netscape's Enterprise Server software,
enabling businesses to create electronic commerce solutions and
deploying them as services on the Internet using Netscape's current
CommerceXpert family of packaged Internet commerce applications,
and providing businesses with every access to the digital
marketplace via Netscape Netcenter, which the company claims to be
one of the most highly trafficked portal sites on the Internet.
	   ``We see a marvellous synergy between the two sides of our
business - our enterprise software solution and the Netscape
Netcenter portal site,'' said Barksdale.
	   The large installed base of Netscape's Navigator Web browser
creates a huge online network of individuals and businesses that
drives traffic to Netscape Netcenter.
	   At the same event, Netscape also released two new software to
help companies sell products and services on the Internet.
	   The software, Netscape SellerXpert 2.0 and MerchantXpert 2.0,
are now available in limited beta versions from Netscape. Both the
software are built on CommerceXpert.
	   According to Netscape, SellerXpert 2.0 is targeted at Global
2000 companies which want to do business with a broad range of
small, medium and large corporate customers.
	   On the other hand, MerchantXpress 2.0 is designed for companies
which want to sell directly to consumers through high volume retail
sites.
	   SellerXpert 2.0 and MerchantXpert 2.0 are expected to ship
commercially by the end of the year, to be deployed on the Sun
Solaris operating system.
	   SellerXpert 2.0 retails at US$195,000 for a two-processor system
while the MerchantXpert 2.0 starts at US$150,000 for a
two-processor system.

	   DBM Proposal: 7.2% Increase Over '98
	   The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has proposed a
moderate increase in the country's national budget to P579.8
billion for fiscal year 1999, up 7.2% from the previous year's
P540.8 billion.
	   Budget Secretary Emilia Boncodin, in a report made during a
recent cabinet meeting, said the proposed budget was made on the
basis of gross national product (GNP) growth of 5%-6%, and improved
gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 4.5%-5.6%.
	   Boncodin said inflation was projected to stay in single-digit
levels, hovering between 6%-7%.
	   The proposed budget is equivalent to 18% of GNP.
	   Fiscal planners see import growth of 10%, while basing their
calculations on a foreign exchange rate of P42-P44:$1.
	   ``The 1999 national budget will basically be a transition budget
and will serve as take-off point for the new administration,''
Boncodin, in an earlier statement, said.
	   ``This will support government's policy of adopting a
conservative economic and fiscal framework to provide the
appropriate resource base for the new administration to put in
place its development agenda,'' she added.
	   DBM Projects Shortfall -- BREAKER DBM, meanwhile, is projecting
a budget shortfall of P17 billion to P27 billion for 1999 as it
anticipates shortcoming in the projected collection of the
estimated P589.9 billion in revenue.
	   Data obtained from the office of DBM's Boncodin indicate that
estimated 1999 revenues may not be realized due to uncollected
taxes and the increase in the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) of
local government units (LGU).
	   According to the budget secretary, the 20% increase in the IRA
of LGUs eats up a large part of the budget.
	   If the P589.9 billion in revenues were actually realized,
government would be looking at a fiscal surplus of P21 billion, in
view of the projected P568.4 billion in disbursements.
	   Despite the P13.2-billion deficit in 1998 for the consolidated
public sector, DBM is still hoping to generate some P5.4 billion in
surplus next year.
	   GOCCs Realize Savings -- BREAKER Surprisingly, government-owned
and -controlled corporations (GOCC) have been able to generate some
P22.1 billion in savings from austerity measures observed by
government corporations.
	   Boncodin revealed that the savings were a result of GOCCs'
compliance with the 25% reserve imposition under Administrative
Order 372.
	   The National Power Corp. contributed the biggest share of P15.81
billion, followed by the National Housing Authority, which posted
savings of P1.61 billion.
	   Boncodin debunked reports that the 25% reserve measure had been
arbitrarily imposed on non-personal services expenditures of
corporate operating budgets of GOCCs.
	   ``GOCCs are given the flexibility to choose which items in their
budget may be identified as a specific source of savings, provided
that the 25% minimum requirement is fully complied with,'' Boncodin
said.
	   The secretary further said priority sectors in the 1999 budget
would include programs aimed at alleviating poverty; completion of
transportation facilities, telecommunication and agricultural
infrastructure; and intensification of programs that promote the
use of advanced technologies.
	   Despite earlier pronouncements that the country's fiscal
position was likely to post a deficit this year, DBM is still
targeting a P21.6 billion surplus in 1998 in order to reduce the
national government's outstanding debt and increase public savings.
	   Meanwhile, Boncodin also reported that as of end-May, DBM had
released some P235 billion, or 43% of the total national budget for
this year, for financing government operations from January to
June. Another P174.4 billion, representing 32% of the total budget,
will be released to cover operations during the second half of the
year.

	   Dear Mr. Speer,
	   We are grateful for your response to a telephone call from our
public relations manager, Hanum Yahya, on Friday May 1, 1998.
	   We regret that the loss of your mobile phone on April 3, 1998,
was not handled efficiently and the fax subsequently sent by our
assistant manager did not properly address your grievances. We
apologize for the disappointment this must have caused you.
	   We sincerely hope that you will accept this delayed response to
your complaint and subsequent fax of April 30, 1998.
	   As a result of your insinuations that our staff were involved in
the theft we conducted a thorough body and locker search on the
night of the theft, but did not find your mobile phone. If, as you
said in your fax, you still wish to report the incident to the
police we would suggest that you do so. We will be happy to
cooperate and, if the police find that Gran Melia Jakarta is
responsible for the loss, we will respond accordingly.
	   In the meantime, we thank you for your understanding and look
forward to being of service to you in the very near future and
helping to improve your impression of the Gran Melia Jakarta.

Francisco's second best known clothing exporter (after Levi

	   Shortly after the resignation of president Soeharto, the reform
movement pioneered by the students throughout Indonesia -- and
fully seconded by the press -- has also touched on the national
press law. The notorious, dreaded regulation No. 1/1984, issued by
former minister of information Harmoko and concerning cancellation
of licenses of press enterprises, has been revoked by the present
minister of information, Muhammad Yunus, in new regulation No.
1/1998.
	   The former press decree implemented Article 13, paragraph 5, of
Press Law No. 11/ 1966, stipulating that press enterprises should
possess licenses. The law has been successively revised with law
No.4/1967 and the law No. 21/ 1984.
	   Revocation of the law should lead to accountability before the
law. In other words, if news articles violate the law, that is, are
considered libelous, the editor or the reporter should stand trial.
	   In the meantime, questions remain as to whether everybody may
publish newspapers and magazines without licenses. Even in other
developing countries with more liberal environments, like Malaysia,
press enterprises must possess licenses which must be renewed every
year.
	   The information minister's regulation No. 01/1984 paragraph 33
deals with the mode of enterprise, while the second, consisting of
paragraph 33h, deals with the code of publication that is news
materials.
	   This paragraph stipulates that the license of press enterprises
can be canceled by the minister of information after the minister
consults the press council, and if it is in accordance with the
council's evaluation that the press enterprise concerned in the
implementation of its publication no longer reflects a healthy,
free and responsible press. What is meant by the phrase is nothing
more than what is called ``The Pancasila Press''.
	   The regulation is equal to press harnessing which is forbidden
by Article 4 of the press law. Dozens of newspapers and magazines
have become victims of the regulation. Among them was the
prestigious weekly magazine Tempo, which had its license canceled
by the minister of information in 1994.
	   Unfortunately, the Supreme Court affirmed the information
minister's decision in its verdict on the case in 1996. Tempo in
1994 reported the case of some 12 ships imported from Germany by
B.J. Habibie in his capacity as then minister of research and
technology. Tempo said several ships were damaged.
	   In this new era, the new government of Indonesia has
``reformed'' the national press system in such a way that the press
is expected to resume the freedom it had in 1945-1959. But other
questions remain, like to what extent the national press of
Indonesia has really regained its freedom.
	   The answer may be rather dismal because there is still the law
No. 1/ 1995 Article 117 paragraph 1 (a) concerning the authority of
a court to close down a limited company on the grounds of bringing
damage to the public interest, after receiving a request from the
attorney general. Most press enterprises of this country are
limited companies.
	   In order to prevent press firms from being closed by the court,
the limited company law should be revised accordingly, perhaps with
the clarification that it is not applicable to press enterprises.

	   The current strike called by 600 PAL pilots is a frightful
example of how the complexities of labor-management relations can
threaten the very existence of a giant corporation, and in this
particular case, the public interest as well.
	   Alpap, the pilots' union, is just one of several unions
representing PAL's 14,000 or so employees. At any one time,
therefore, PAL's management might have to negotiate different
collective bargaining agreements with conflicting interests and
demands.
	   Minority Calls the Shots Alpap is definitely a very powerful
union because planes simply cannot be flown without pilots. Thus,
600 of 14,000 employees can paralyze the corporation. That brings
up the question of whether the interests of 600 employees should
dictate the fate of the rest of PAL's 14,000 employees, and the
fortunes of the company's investors as well. No question about
pilots having rights. What must be sorted out is whose rights
should prevail given the financial condition of the airline and the
greater number of employees whose jobs are on the line as well even
if their interests are not involved.

	   The banking industry, which lies at the root of Indonesia's
economic crisis, and the central bank are now mired in a vicious
circle.
	   The government's blanket guarantee for foreign exchange and
rupiah depositor and creditor claims on locally incorporated banks
has been causing moral hazards not only throughout the industry but
also for the bank supervisory mechanism and depositors. The
guarantee, provided in late January to prevent banking panics and
runs, has overtaxed the role of the central bank, Bank Indonesia,
as the lender of last resort. It has unintentionally forced the
central bank to provide liquidity support not only to illiquid but
solvent banks, but also to outright insolvent ones.
	   We expected the central bank and the Indonesian Bank
Restructuring Agency (IBRA) to act quickly and firmly on insolvent
banks as soon its across-the-board guarantee was put in place
because the risk of massive panics would be minimized.
	   But it is now painfully apparent that it is the central bank
that is now in a panic, making huge liquidity injections into banks
without proper evaluations of their assets and operational
viability. The latest official reports show that as of June 5, Bank
Indonesia has pumped Rp 132 trillion (US$12 billion) in liquidity
credits into problem banks, up from Rp 101 trillion early last
month. The total does not include liquidity injections to illiquid
banks which are still sound enough to evade the IBRA hospital.
	   This anomaly is eroding market discipline among banks and
cutting into the profitability of the banking industry as insolvent
institutions are allowed to remain afloat to compete with solvent
ones.
	   Likewise, large depositors and creditors, who are supposed to
have more resources and are better informed of bank conditions,
also seem affected by the moral hazard. They have become lax in
enforcing market discipline on weaker banks because they feel
secure that the guarantee scheme will bail them out of any trouble.
	   Worse still, the establishment of IBRA in late January, when the
blanket guarantee was announced, has caused both a moral hazard at
the central bank and dualism in bank supervision. IBRA is in charge
of supervising and managing problem banks, while the central bank
is to handle what are classified as sound banks. But the intensity
and quality of the central bank's supervision of banks under its
purview seems to have declined since it can now simply dump problem
banks onto IBRA.
	   As the amount of bad credit steadily increases due to the
battered economy and punitive lending rates as high as 70 percent,
the quality of most bank assets has been deteriorating as well.
This has raised concerns that the central bank or IBRA might not be
able to recoup the huge liquidity credits already pumped into the
banking system.
	   Contrary to official optimism, most analysts do not expect, at
least until political uncertainty is removed, any significant
strengthening of the beleaguered rupiah. Without a stronger rupiah,
the high interest rates will most likely be maintained with
devastating effects on both businesses and banks.
	   Recapitalization seems now the most effective and quickest way
of restructuring the ailing banks. But not a single domestic
investor is capable or likely willing to invest in the crippled
banking industry since most large business groups, which are
themselves major shareholders in most banks, are being overburdened
with foreign debts. Foreign capital inflow or a return of
Indonesian capital, which fled overseas after the recent riots in
Jakarta and other areas, is not a prospect either.
	   The outlook is quite grim indeed. As the capital base of most
banks erodes and with a virtual stop in new lending, more banks
will eventually be forced to enter IBRA care, which is now tending
to more than 45 distressed banks.
	   Given the severe banking crisis and the blunt fact that its
resolution is crucial for the stabilization of the rupiah at a
reasonable level, it is high time for both the central bank and
IBRA to act firmly and quickly on insolvent banks. Allowing them to
stay afloat with additional liquidity credits not only makes it
more difficult to strengthen the whole banking industry but also
risks wasting a huge sum of public funds and further
hyperinflation.

	   Barangay Bel Air Village in Makati is a very popular place to
visit during the holiday season because the entire village turns
into a Christmas wonderland. However, this year, you need not wait
until December to visit Bel Air to view its beautiful decorations.
	   This time, the village and barangay are awash in patriotic
splendor to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the country's
independence.
	   Bel Air's very talented Decor Committee designed the Centennial
decorations by recycling the bamboo poles and Christmas tree used
last year. Now, the angel-filled Christmas tree has been
transformed into a red, white, and blue ``Centennial Cake,''
decorated with 100 candles and topped with the Centennial logo. At
the two main gates on Paseo de Roxas Ave. and Orbit St., visitors
are greeted with beautiful ``arkos'', Bel Air's interpretation of
the City of Makati's symbol of the celebration and expression of
hospitality.
	   In every corner and house within the barangay, various symbols
of our revolutionary past are also displayed.
	   Over at the village's covered court hang five paintings
depicting important historical events and personalities. These
include the first flag-raising in Kawit, Cavite; Jose Rizal and his
novels; the sewing of the Philippine flag; and Bonifacio and the
KKK.
	   Historical Filipino flags adorn the golden bamboo poles placed
on every street corner of the barangay including Salcedo Village,
along Gil Puyat Ave. (to Ayala) and Jupiter St.
	   To give everyone an opportunity to display their national pride,
the Barangay distributed Philippine flags to every house in the
village and to all commercial and residential buildings. Even the
stalls along Jupiter were given small flags.
	   Bel Air welcomes everyone during this special time in our
nation's history to absorb the glorious symbols and feel the
nationalistic pride that every Filipino should experience when
remembering the heroic deeds of our revolutionary forefathers.
	   The Bel Air Village Centennial Decor will be on display until
the Christmas season.

	   SEVERAL issues concerning the management of supply chains in
many manufacturing and distribution companies have been highlighted
in recent years. Concepts like business process re-engineering,
customer/supplier linking and quick response have been applied to
improve the overall effectiveness of these industries.
	   In all of these concepts, information technology (IT) has been
used as an important facilitator. Intentia International's director
of strategic application development Professor Stig-Arne Mattsson
believes that there are a number of reasons behind the increased
focus on supply chain management. One such reason is the trend
towards longer supply chains.
	   ``This is due to the fact that the number of independent
companies involved in the material flow from raw material to the
consuming-end customer has increased,'' he said at a manufacturing
seminar held in Petaling Jaya recently.
	   Mattsson said this extension has taken place both on the supply
and distribution side of the company that manufactures the end
product.
	   With the extension of this supply chain, the distance between
the manufacturer and the consuming-end customer has increased. This
is noted both geographically and from the operational point of
view, he added.
	   At the same time there is a strong trend towards more and more
customer- oriented products and production that emphasises close
relationships between suppliers and customers. Short lead times
have been emphasised and considered of vital importance to stay
competitive.
	   These current trends imply that a number of new approaches have
been developed and used, Mattsson said.
	   Most of these approaches are of a more extensive integration
between suppliers and customers. At the same time, they are based
on the use of advanced IT.
	   Mattsson said the implementation of electronic data interchange
(EDI) and computerised decision making as well as introduction of
customer/supplier linking by forward or backward integration are
examples of widely-used steps taken in the industry. ``EDI,
compared to other messaging technologies, is categorised by its use
of standardised message structures and contents. By using EDI, some
of the important supply chain issues can be taken care of,'' he
said.
	   ``For example, the lead time from sending to receiving
information can be decreased and the amount of manual
administrative work is reduced. It thus supports the reduction of
transaction costs.''
	   With EDI, he added, more computerised transaction processing and
decision making can be achieved. This is where the administrative
work involved in each transaction can be reduced even further.
Mattsson said another option is to develop more efficient
customer/supplier relationships.
	   ``This can be carried out by re-engineering the business
processes so that some of the activities involved can be
eliminated,'' Mattsson said.
	   One possible re-engineering approach is to let the supplier be
responsible for the customer's stock. This method is called forward
integration or vendor managed inventories.
	   Through access to the customer's inventory and demand data, the
supplier can control and replenish stock without any intermediate
activities from purchasing and order entry personnel.
	   Mattsson said the other option is backward integration. It means
basically to let personnel at the customer site enter customer
orders online directly into the suppliers manufacturing system
without involving supplier personnel.
	   ``In this case, some restrictions in what the customer can be
allowed to do might be necessary - for instance, in matters
concerning rescheduling, entering orders above capacity levels or
entering orders when available- to-promise for the ordered item,''
he said.

Historic collection of only public library on St. Thomas closes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JUDI SHIMEL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ It can't find a
qualified librarian, much of its collection of historic documents
remains in boxes and even some of the shelves have been stolen.
	   Facing those troubles, officials at the Enid Baa Library have
closed the Van Scholten Collection of archives to the public and do
not know when it will be open again. The library itself is
operating on a part-time schedule without a librarian.
	   Housed in a historic building in downtown Charlotte Amalie, Baa
Library is the only library serving St. Thomas' 50,000 people. It
also serves the public school system through a computerized
information system and assists hundreds of secondary and college
students.
	   The main problem is the inability of the library to attract a
qualified librarian. Starting pay is $20,208 at the library.
	   ``I guess the basis of the whole thing is we're having a problem
with staffing and funding at the library,'' said Elliott Whisonant,
a spokesman for the Department of Planning and Natural Resources.
``We don't have anyone who's an archivist or anyone with a masters'
in library science to administer as far as cataloging and assisting
the general public is concerned.''
	   For now, the library plans to remain open at least part-time
with the help of summer interns.
	   In addition to staffing problems, crime hit the library:
Shelving donated by the District Court and valued at dlrs 10,000
was stolen while being stored by the Department of Public Works.
	   At the library, which was closed in May for inventory, workers
had removed books from shelves to prepare for the arrival of the
new shelves. Then they simply had to put the books back, Whisonant
said.
	   The now-closed Van Scholten Collection contains an estimated
15,000 monographs, some dating back to the 17th century. Another
10,000 to 12,000 historic books and documents, acquired through a
marshal's sale in the late 1970s, are still in a storage area
waiting to be processed and put on public display.
	   There are two public libraries on St. Croix and one on St. John,
in addition to the Baa Library on St. Thomas.

	   Like their cousins at zoos across the country, animals at
Ragunan Zoo in South Jakarta are finding the economic crisis has
taken a big bite out of their food allotments.
	   The zoo's development and promotion manager, Nonot Marsono, told
The Jakarta Post Tuesday that carnivores such as tigers, leopards,
jaguars and eagles now had to go without food for up to four days a
week.
	   ``We are trying to change their eating patterns gradually. After
all, they don't eat every day when they are in their original
habitat, do they?''
	   But he emphasized the 4,448 representatives of 312 species at
the zoo are still in good condition despite the leaner diet.
	   ``We have also learned that the animals have recorded no
reduction in their weight.''
	   Since April, the zoo has cut the daily meat supply for
carnivores by 30 kilograms to 240 kilograms
	   Only infant and adult carnivores that are pregnant, suckling or
sick are excluded from the dietary restrictions, he said.
	   Before the crisis, the carnivores were not fed every Sunday to
keep them fit.
	   Nonot acknowledged that the number of visitors had sharply
declined in the past few months but gave no precise figures, saying
the management would only release the data in June.
	   Last year, the number of visitors reached 2.15 million of a
target of 3 million.
	   ``I understand that the monetary crisis has badly hit people
from all walks of life,'' he said.
	   The zoo's entrance fee is currently set at Rp 500 (4 U.S. cents)
for children and Rp 1,000 for adults.
	   To compound the effects of skyrocketing prices of food and the
decline of visitors, the zoo also suffered a significant drop in
financial support from the city administration, he said.
	   The zoo's annual budget allocated for the 1998/1999 fiscal year
has dropped 68 percent, to Rp 1.7 billion from the previous Rp 2.5
billion.
	   ``The money is used mostly for buying food for the animals and
their medicine,'' Nonot said.
	   Considered among Asia's best zoos in terms of its collection,
the 134-year-old Ragunan is home to several rare Indonesian
species, such as the Komodo dragon, Sumatran tiger and orangutan.
	   Situated on 135 acres, Ragunan also acts as a conservation site,
educational center and research facility.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - The controversy involving the three DAP
leaders following disciplinary action taken against them last week
appeared set to trigger a wider split within the party.
	   While Penang DAP grassroots leaders voted in favour of the
decision taken by the central executive commitee's against national
vice-chairman Liew Ah Kim, treasurer Fung Ket Wing and national
publicity secretary Wee Choo Keong, four State committees said they
felt the three should be allowed to present their case and be given
a fair hearing.
	   The four are Selangor, Sabah, Sarawak and Johor.
	   In Penang, the State branch leaders last night came out in
support of the CEC's decision to suspend Liew and Fung and remove
Wee.
	   A motion, drafted and tabled by secretary-general Lim Kit Siang,
was passed by 66 votes in favour and 11 votes against with six
abstentions after a three-hour briefing by three CEC leaders to the
party's State committee and branch committee members.
	   The CEC had on June 3 suspended Liew and treasurer Fung from
their party posts for criticising the party leadership and removed
Wee as national publicity secretary.
	   In another development, the trio's attempts to clear their name
proceeded with them lodging a complaint with the disciplinary
committee against Kit Siang for making ``baseless allegations''
against them (See Page 2).
	   The CEC had referred the three to the disciplinary committee
headed by vice-chairman Ahmad Nor for further action. Until the
committee meets, they will remain CEC members.
	   Commenting on the controversy, Kit Siang told newsmen last night
that the DAP was not split over the CEC action in Penang.
	   However, party sources said that although Kit Siang had managed
to muster sizeable support last night, it was clear that the DAP
was split over the issue.
	   ``Many national and State senior party leaders have either been
silent or do not support the CEC action against the trio,'' they
said.

	   Protesters called for the mayor's resignation here yesterday,
while a separate demonstration demanded a major company clarify the
status of its workers.
	   Over 900 employees of private retail company PT Multipolar
Perkasa demonstrated at the company's head office in Karawaci,
demanding the management clarify their employment status.
	   The protesters' spokesman, Koesnandar, said their status was
unclear since the company closed down its Wal-Mart outlets here and
at Mega Mal in Pluit, North Jakarta after the May riots.
	   The Wal-Mart at Lippo Supermal in Karawaci was badly damaged but
the outlet at Mega Mall Pluit was left unscathed by the mobs.
	   Koesnandar said the employees demanded the company provide
severance pay in accordance with government regulations if it
planned to permanently close the stores.
	   After meeting with the workers' representatives, the company
agreed to the demands.
	   ``Almost all of the employees' demands were granted. The
severance payment will be issued next Monday,'' the company's
finance director, Ketut B. Wijaya, said.
	   Separately, 200 residents held a demonstration demanding
Tangerang Mayor Djakaria Mahmud resign because of alleged corrupt,
collusive and nepotistic practices.
	   They accused Djakaria of giving several middle ranking positions
at the mayoralty to his relatives and friends.
	   Djakaria's brother Muhaemin was appointed head of the
mayoralty's parks and funeral office, while Suparman and Cholil,
old friends of the mayor, respectively became the assistant of the
mayoralty's administration department and the head of the
mayoralty's planning office, they said.
	   They claimed that some councilors, especially from the Golkar
faction, were the wives of mayoralty officials.
	   When asked to comment on the protesters' accusations, Djakaria
denied having a close relationship with Suparman and Cholil.
	   He also said his brother had already resigned from his post.
	   ``My job will be audited by the government at the end of my term
this month, at which time they will look into accusations of
corruption,'' he said.
	   ``Let's see later who's right and who's wrong,'' Djakaria said.

	   Banks' Profitability in '98 Q1 Down P51M to P11.69B
	   The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) yesterday announced that
banks' return on equity (ROE) during the first quarter fell by P51
million to P11.69 billion from the end-1997 level of P12.2 billion.
	   The over-all profit of commercial banks dropped by P59 million
to P12.39 billion from P12.98 billion last year.
	   BSP Director for Economic Research Diwa Gunigundo in an
interview explained the drop in banks' ROE was expected given the
ongoing economic turbulence.
	   Moreover, banks were said to have set aside large portion of
their earnings in compliance with the 20% to 60% hike in the
minimum capitalization requirement as well as the 2% general
loan-loss provisioning which the BSP accelerated to October 1999
from December of the same year. BSP set December 2000 as the
deadline for the capital hike.
	   Loan-loss provisions serve as safety nets for banks in cases of
loan defaults.
	   Gunigundo said commercial banks' provisioning totaled P1.37
trillion, from last year's P1.42 trillion.
	   In the last two years, loan-loss provisions have increased from
44.29% of the total non-performing loans (NPL) in 1996 to 47.17%
last year. NPL pertains to debts not serviced after three months.
	   However, Gunigundo emphasized the banking sector maintained its
robust health despite the downtrend as evidenced by the improvement
in the capital adequacy ratio of banks - from 16.02% in 1997 to
17.27% in the first three months of this year.
	   ``That was for all banks but for commercial banks, the capital
adequacy ratio increased to 17.10% from 15.87%. With these, we can
say that there is no danger in the system although the decrease in
profits was an initial effect of the directive (capital
increase),'' he said.
	   Gunigundo also disclosed that credit growth, though positive,
declined from 26.5% to 19.1%.
	   But the figure was higher than March's actual record of 16.2%
due to an improvement in the sectors of manufacturing, mining, and
utilities.
	   The BSP economist pointed out credit lines were very stringent
in view of the lingering effects of the financial crunch and that
borrowers were too anxious to indulge in loan-sprees. ``Interest
rates at that time were too high,'' he said.
	   Gunigundo admitted an increasing inflation could buoy up
interest rates to higher levels but emphasized it was unlikely that
the 91-day Treasury-bill rate would go beyond 20%.
	   Latest bellwether rate which has been the barometer of loan
pricing was at 13.9%. Commercial loans were charged between 15.4%
and 19.95%.
	   A ranking BSP official, in a separate interview, said exorbitant
interest rates were to blame for the rise in the NPL in the first
quarter.
	   end-February level of 6.7%.
	   ``Should inflation rate continue to increase, NPL's will still
not reach a double-digit figure because interest rates are
stabilizing which will allow easier payment of loans. Moreso,
banks' intermediation cost has been slashed significantly by the
central bank so mas mababa na ang (hence, the lower) interest
rates,'' he said.
	   ``But we have to consider that 11 years ago, past-due loans were
only at 13.51%. In 1988, they were estimated at 11.59% and 8.96% in
1989. Only this year we have higher NPLs because of the crisis,''
he said.
	   The official said the country was still better-off than Malaysia
and Indonesia whose delinquent debts hit the 40% to 50% zone. Some
bankers even speculated Indonesian NPLs were now at 80%.
	   BSP Governor Gabriel C. Singson predicted NPLs by yearend would
be at 8% of the entire loan portfolio.

	   Bogor Police have been urged to requestion three students from
Juanda University who were charged with beating a police officer to
death.
	   The demand was made on Tuesday by the three students and their
lawyers at a meeting with Bogor Regional Police chief Col. Abubakar
Nataprawira.
	   Daniel Panjaitan of the Jakarta Legal Aid Institute said on
behalf of the three students -- Tb. Ade Imanuddin, Syaifullah and
Emon Wahyudi -- that a new interrogation was needed to find fresh
evidence.
	   ``Our clients were under pressure when they were interrogated at
the police detention for nearly one month. It violates the Criminal
Code Procedures,'' Daniel told The Jakarta Post.
	   Moreover, the students were also tortured, he said. ``We will
report the torture to the Bogor Military Police.''
	   He admitted that the police had appointed two lawyers,
identified as Agus Mujiman and Andi M Yusuf of Mitra law office in
Bogor, to accompany the students, but the appointment was rejected
by the students.
	   ``We hope the police give our clients a chance to give their
honest explanations. The police will be happy if the death of
Dadang can be revealed fairly and honestly,'' he said.
	   According to Daniel, Abubakar will decide today whether to agree
to the students' request.
	   He said Abubakar also allowed the students to report to the
police once a week instead of twice a week as demanded during their
release.
	   The three students were released Friday in response to mounting
demand from the students' colleagues. Despite the release the
police said they would continue to charge the three with beating
Second. Lt. Dadang Rusmana to death and take the case to the court.
	   Police accused the three students of beating Dadang in a
demonstration in front of the university's mosque on May 9.
	   The case became controversial when forensic expert Yuli
Budiningsih of the Indonesian Red Cross Bogor Hospital publicly
revealed that Dadang's death was caused by a heart attack and not
by a beating.
	   Daniel said yesterday that Yuli would be questioned by Bogor
police today about her conclusions following the autopsy.
	   He said Yuli would be accompanied by the head of the forensic
department at the Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, Budi
Sampurna.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - About 3,000 graduate and non-graduate
teachers, many stuck in their grades for a number of years, have
been promoted under an exercise to reward long-serving teachers.
	   Announcing this today, Education Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak
said the promotions, backdated to last January, will cost the
Government RM18.9 million.
	   He said despite the tight budget, the exercise was being carried
out to reflect the Government's recognition of their service.
	   The teachers will receive their new salary next month but the
arrears will only be paid in stages when the economy recovers.
	   ``Under phase one, 1,956 graduate and 1,009 non-graduate
teachers will be promoted. Another 2,300 teachers are being
considered by the Education Service Promotion Board for promotion
under phase two, which will be carried out before the end of the
year,'' Najib said at a Press conference after chairing a
post-Cabinet meeting at the ministry.
	   The programme to reward long-serving teachers was approved by
the Cabinet in July last year, as many qualified teachers could not
be promoted due to limited vacancies.
	   Besides a salary increase and annual increments, the promoted
teachers will also receive additional benefits such as higher
housing allowances.
	   Graduate teachers at the top of their grade DG3 now receive
RM3,177 a month. Under the new grade DG2, they will be paid
RM3,222, with five annual increments before reaching the maximum
salary of RM3,952.
	   Non-graduate teachers who are promoted from DG6 to DG5 will now
get RM1,975 a month instead of RM1,930. They will reach the maximum
salary of RM2,170 in three years.
	   Najib said the promotions had to be divided into stages as the
ministry's original allocation of RM43 million for the purpose had
been slashed.
	   He said the time-based promotion was introduced in response to
the proposals contained in the Tan Sri Abdul Rahman Arshad
committee report on education service which were difficult to
implement due to the huge sums involved.

	   In an effort to fully maximize the use of its operational areas
and assist shipping lines, Asian Terminals Inc. (ATI), the sole
terminal operator of South Harbor, has cut down the volume of
overstaying containers by at least 61%-from 987 units in January to
280 in May.
	   ``ATI, with the support from the Bureau of Customs (BOC), has
effectively reduced the volume of overstaying containers by
intensifying and adopting a more aggressive approach,'' Atty.
Maximino Cruz, ATI's agency and customer relations consultant,
said.
	   Cruz disclosed that ATI closely coordinates and actively assists
the Bureau in disposing the goods by initiating moves that will
make it easier for BOC to auction them.
	   Aside from proposing innovative measures to speed up disposition
of cargoes, ATI regularly furnishes the BOC with a complete list if
overstaying containers. It also provides BOC with important
information which are available within the ATI system.
	   ``This will help facilities the publication of cargoes and
immediately sell them in auction,'' said. ``Most of the proceeds
from the auction sale of overstaying shipments go the government.''
	   Apart from assisting BOC, ATI also ensures that the port
equipment are readily available for container inspection and
stripping at all times, and coordinates with shipping lines to
dispose of cargoes considered condemned.
	   Not only has the volume of overstaying containers been
significantly reduced, Cruz said, but the moves done by ATI has
allowed the firms to maximize its use of available operation areas
by creating additional spaces and allowing faster turnaround of
cargoes.
	   For shipping lines, overstaying containers, or those which have
been staying in the port for at least 30 days, incur opportunity
cost as long as they are not emptied of their cargoes. This means
they could not be able to make use or reposition their containers.
	   Consequently, the occurrence of overstaying containers has also
deprived government of the revenues originally due it, since the
cargoes inside these containers have either deteriorated in
condition or have totally lost their economic value.

	   THE popularity of online gaming is really catching on. There has
been quite a good selection of flight simulations,
three-dimensional (3-D) shooters and real-time strategy games
lately, what with the number of people getting connected to the
Internet growing almost exponentially. And among the most notable
online games around is, of course, LucasArts' renowned X-Wing vs
TIE Fighter.
	   If one were to check out the number of sites on the Internet
dedicated to that one particular LucasArts title, one would
probably be astounded.
	   And the frequency of the sort of online gaming activities
indicated by most of those sites, especially the call for the
formation and pitting of new ``squadrons of flying access'', is
very telling on just how quickly gamers with access to the Internet
have caught the X vs T online craze.
	   Unfortunately, much of all this is relevant mostly for gamers in
the West who have access to Internet service providers (ISPs) that
provide support for 56K operations.
	   Ideally, that is the speed with which a gamer who wishes a
decent X vs T online gaming experience should be connected to the
Internet.
	   For most gamers in Malaysia, that is not possible as yet, since
the ISPs in Malaysia have yet to provide full support for 56K
operations, which means X vs T over the Internet should not really
be worth its bother.
	   A fellow gamer, Chan Chun Yew and I tried, being the optimists
that we were. We both had anticipated some kind of ``lag'' (delayed
reaction) but still thought that we could get some fun out of the
experience or, at the very least, thought it was worth the try just
to see how bad the lag could get. What he and I ended up with was
mixed feelings about X vs T online.
	   First we determined who would play host. Since my personal
computer (PC) was faster - mine being a P/Pro 200 and his being an
ageing P166 - I played host thinking that it would make a
difference - it did not. Next we determined what my Internet
protocol (IP) address had been - it changes from time to time so we
used ICQ, a mini-online chat and instant messenger program, to
determine it.
	   After that we both booted up X vs T. I clicked on ``Host a
Game'' and waited. What my friend had to do was to key in my IP
address under the ``Configuration'' panel for multi-player gaming
and then click on ``Join Game''. Next thing we knew we were both
connected and, surprisingly, without a hitch.
	   I suppose the guys and gals at LucasArts had ironed out all the
connection problems when they released a game patch that would
upgrade a gamer's X vs T from version 1.0 to 1.1 and both Chan and
I were running the latter version.
	   At the ``Host Screen'', I waited not more than a few seconds for
Chan's ``handle'' to appear under mine. It appeared as ``Ace 1st -
Dragonfire''. ``Not bad,'' I thought. ``Ace 1st class'' was also my
rating. I was all set to see who was the better fighter-jock, who
would get more kills or engage the more dangerous adversaries like
the TIE Advanced, the prickly Escort Shuttles or even the dreaded
X-Wing. I also thought that maybe I could even teach Chan a few
moves.
	   Boy! Were we disappointed. The first combat engagement I chose
was named ``Attack on Imperial Factory Dekker'' and we played the
side of the Rebels.
	   It was a relatively easy mission, especially if one has flown it
a few times and has chosen a superior fighter like the A-Wing
fighter interceptor or at the very least an X-Wing superiority
fighter.
	   I chose the former while Chan chose the latter. However, having
it played online and on the Internet, the mission turned out to be
a nightmare.
	   Immediately after launch, I noticed how poor the visual frame
rate had become. The lag was so bad that it was like watching
stills or a slide show. However, the simulated enemies were not
affected at all. Not only were they harder to hit, the way Chan and
I were being hit would have given others the impression that we
were really contented with being shot at.
	   I also noticed how poorly my CH F-16 Flight Stick was
performing. My A- Wing kept pulling to the right and was very
sluggish on left-banking turns. Moreover, the digital sound effects
just did not jive with the images that were literally flickering in
front of my eyes.
	   Only after having damage register on my ``heads down display
(HDD)'' did I actually hear the rasping digital sound effects of
enemy laser fire connecting with my A-Wing.
	   ``This is no fun,'' I thought and Chan seemed to agree. ``Whoa!
The lag is really bad, man ...'' was the in-flight message that I
received. I would have liked to have continued reading the banter a
bit more if not for that nasty TIE Advanced chewing up my A-Wing's
tail.
	   So I ejected and waited for Chan to realise that I was no longer
flying in the mission before he joined me at the ``Host Screen''.
	   At the right side of the screen scrolled the words, ``Yo!
Bloodfang. I did not know what was happening the moment the mission
started. I know there was going to be lag, but I did not think it
was this bad,''
	   complained Chan. I replied, ``Maybe if we tried 'direct modem
connection' the lag would disappear''. Chan agreed.
	   So we disconnected from each other and from the Internet, and
later reconnected via direct modem. However, to our disappointment,
there was no difference whatsoever. We even tried to turn down
every single fancy effect: from 3-D to garaud shading.
	   We even considered changing our screen resolution to 340 X 320
but what would have been the point to that? We would simply be
playing an inferior version of X vs T and cheating ourselves of all
the realism that came with the game.
	   From the experience, both of us concluded that it was either we
connected using 56K modems or we linked our PC via direct serial
connection. 56K modem connections meant that playing X vs T over
the Internet in Malaysia was out of the question for now and since
neither of us had a 56K modem handy we could not use the direct
modem connection mode. And since it was late and we both stayed
quite a distance from each other, direct serial connection was also
out of the question.
	   In any case, playing online should be fun-filled and relatively
hassle- free but, as it turned out, playing X vs T online was
really a daunting experience.
	   Maybe when 56K modem operations become a bit more common in
Malaysia will gamers here truly benefit from the online gaming
experience of X-Wing vs TIE Fighter.
	   Otherwise it is just a few enthusiastic buddies with 56K modems
or those determined enough to set up their PCs via direct serial
connection who would truly enjoy X vs T online.

	   The Commission on Elections (Comelec) was asked to proclaim the
Association of Philippine Electric Cooperatives (APEC) as a duly
elected party-list organization in the May 11 elections.
	   In a petition filed before the Comelec, APEC Secretary General
Wendell Ballesteros has also urged the poll body to ``immediately
proclaim APEC without any further delay in order to subserve the
interest of justice and the welfare of the electorate who voted for
the party-list representatives.''
	   APEC argued that the results in the special elections to be
conducted by the Comelec would not substantially alter or change
the canvas of votes for APEC.
	   The official Comelec canvass showed that APEC got 491,323 votes
or 5.5% of the total votes cast for the party-list of 8.92 million
votes.
	   Even if the uncanvassed votes of 300,000 in the special
elections will be cast in favor of the other party-list candidates
and not a single vote will be cast in favor of APEC, the same will
not materially or substantially alter or change the results of the
canvass of votes.
	   APEC got a total 491,323 votes equivalent to 5.5% which entitles
the petitioner to the maximum of three seats in the House of
Representatives under Republic Act 7941 and its implementing rules
and regulations promulgated by the Comelec.
	   Comelec has publicly canvassed simultaneously the results of the
elections for senators and party-list representatives and
subsequently proclaimed the 12 winning senators despite the
pre-proclamation protest filed by the 13th losing senatorial
candidates.
	   ``APEC is similarly situated if not the same as the 12 winning
senators and should therefore be proclaimed immediately by the
Comelec without any further delay in order to subserve the interest
of justice,'' Ballesteros pointed out.
	   He added that there were other party-list organizations which
have also garnered sufficient number of votes during the May 11
elections.

	   ADVANTAGE Systems Sdn Bhd recently introduced seven new high-end
line and dot-matrix printers under the Tally brand to the local
market.
	   The new line printers are the T6140, T6141 and T6180, while the
dot- matrix models comprise the T2040, T2055, T2070 and T2070-2T.
	   Advantage's product manager for Tally printers and Axis products
William Ng claimed the T6180 is currently the world's fastest line
printer.
	   ``The T6180 is fast because it can print two rows at one time at
a speed of 1,800 lines per minute based on the shutter
technology,'' Ng said.
	   The model is designed with fast reduced instruction set
computing (RISC) controller featuring Page Segmentation
Architecture (PSA) which is designed to intelligently arrange data
into pages prior to printing. It handles six-part forms and prints
a line up to 136 columns wide at 10 characters per inch (cpi).
	   Ng said the printer is also able to produce uniform and solid
dot creation with the injection-moulded impact element.
	   The auto-switching parallel and serial interfaces come standard
with FourPlex and LANPlex. It also supports personal computers
(PCs), IBM mid- range and mainframe systems, and network printing
formats.
	   Two other models - the T6140 and T6141 - are able to print 1,420
lines per minute with 250,000 pages per month workload. The
difference between the two is the quiet cabinet design on the T6141
which emits less noise.
	   The Tally line printers, including the T6180, are equipped with
various software applications including one for printing barcode.
	   ``The significant feature about the Tally printers is that they
have more printer drivers (including Windows driver) than any other
line printer in the market,'' Ng said.
	   ``And compared to the older version of Tally printers, the new
range prints graphics faster.''
	   He said the T6140, T6141 and T6180 are designed for fast and
heavy-duty printing. They are considered to be suitable for use in
the banking, securities, corporate, manufacturing and government
sectors.
	   As for the T2040, it is a high-end dot matrix printer able to
handle 480 characters per second (cps) with 24 needles. It is a
front-feed machine with paper handling, paper park, and view and
tear point-of-sale (POS) applications.
	   The T2040 is intended for printing invoices, picking lists and
labels as well as licences, tickets, registration forms and cards.
	   Another two models - the T2055 and T2070 - are considered to be
Tally's fastest serial impact printers with 24 needles and
136-column printing.
	   They offer 730cps and 1,050cps printing speed respectively with
1,750 and 2,250 pages per day workload.
	   Both models have push tractors for continuous paper stock and
single sheet insertion for cut forms.
	   The T2070-2T has a second tractor to facilitate quick and easy
changing between two continuous paper stocks. Its straight paper
path ensures that the heavy forms and multi-part stock are
processed reliably.
	   Incorporation of the Automatic Gap Adjustment feature ensures
optimum print quality and reliable feeding of paper, Ng said.
	   Parallel and Serial RS232 interfaces are standard. For network,
it provides optional IBM Coax and Twinax interface.
	   According to Ng, Advantage sold about 300 units of the Tally
line printers by the middle of last year.
	   ``Out of these, the return rate was only five to eight per cent,
which indicates how reliable the printers were,'' he said.
	   He added that Advantage would be working with systems
integrators and business partners to push the printers.
	   The company expects about 100 units of the new printers to be
sold by the end of this year, with half going to its existing
customers and demand for the remaining half to come from new users.
	   ``To achieve this target, we will be sending flyers to customers
to tell them about such printers, inviting them for demos at our
showroom and educating them on the printers that really fit their
requirements,'' Ng said.
	   The Tally printers are estimated to have between 20 to 25 per
cent of the local line printer market at present.
	   Retail price of the T6180 is about RM55,000 while the T6140 and
T6141 are priced at around RM35,000.

	   RATING Agency Malaysia Bhd (RAM) has reaffirmed the P2 rating
assigned to Kelang Port Management Sdn Bhd (KPM)'s Murabahah
underwritten notes issuance facility.
	   The rating agency said in a statement that despite the economic
slowdown which has negatively affected KPM's throughput and
revenue, the company's financial strength and strong balance sheet
will enable it to absorb the effects of the downturn without
adversely affecting its debt servicing ability.
	   RAM said the strength of KPM's shareholders - Kontena Nasional
Bhd (52.5 per cent), Malaysia International Shipping Corp (25 per
cent), Selangor State Government (12.5 per cent) and Lembaga
Urusuan Tabung Haji (10 per cent) - further enhances its risk
profile.

	   UNION Paper Holdings Bhd (UPHB) is undergoing a restructuring
exercise which will change its core activities, and has proposed a
series of acquisitions and disposals designed to rescue the company
with the injection of income generating assets and selling off its
loss-making business.
	   Since 1994, the UPHB group has been incurring losses from its
existing business of manufacturing and trading paper products. By
the end of its 1997 financial year, there was a RM709,526
deficiency in shareholders' funds.
	   It is currently going into the oil palm, cocoa, timber and civil
engineering business with proposed acquisitions in three companies
in these sectors, and disposing of its paper manufacturing
operations.
	   UPHB intends to acquire the entire equity interest in Tung Hup
Enterprise Sdn Bhd for RM305.42 million, to be satisfied by the
issue of 226.23 million new UPHB ordinary shares at an issue price
of RM1.35.
	   Tung Hup is involved in timber extraction and cultivation of oil
palm and cocoa.
	   It has also proposed the acquisition of the entire equity
interest in Tracpower Sdn Bhd for RM22.48 million, to be satisfied
by the issue of 16.65 million new UPHB shares at an issue price of
RM1.35.
	   Tracpower is involved in timber extraction and road and bridge
maintenance contracts.
	   Another proposed acquisition is the entire equity interest in
Syarikat Tung Hup Plantations Sdn Bhd (STHP) for RM5.91 million, to
be satisfied by the issue of 4.38 million new UPHB shares at an
issue price of RM1.35.
	   STHP is involved in the cultivation of cocoa and oil palm and
investment holding.
	   The final acquisition is a 25 per cent stake in Marceda Corp Sdn
Bhd for RM68,609, to be satisfied by the issue of 50,822 new UPHB
shares at an issue price of RM1.35.
	   Another part of the restructuring sees UPHB disposing for RM1,
debt- ridden Union Paper Industries Sdn Bhd (UPI) which
manufactures toilet paper, joss paper, wrapping paper and
cardboard.
	   It will be disposed of to Queeline, an existing substantial
shareholder of UPHB.
	   The individual vendors of Tung Hup have undertaken to deposit a
sum of up to a maximum of RM26.5 million to be used to repay and
discharge the debts owing by UPI.
	   There is also an offer for sale by Queeline and the vendors of
Tung Hup for ordinary shares of RM1 each in UPHB to the public
shareholders of UPHB and new investors at an offer price which
shall not be lower than the issue price of the UPHB shares.
	   This is to comply with the public shareholding spread
requirements of the Securities Commission and for Queeline to raise
funds, if necessary, to repay on behalf of UPI an inter-company
debt due to UPHB by UPI.
	   The amount owing to UPHB by UPI as at March 31 was RM6.55
million.
	   There is also a proposed employees' share option scheme (ESOS)
for eligible employees and executive directors of UPHB and its new
subsidiaries on completion of the proposed acquisitions and
disposals.
	   UPHB also proposes to increase its share capital to RM500
million to cater for an enlarged share capital following the
proposed acquisitions.
	   Following the ESOS and proposed acquisitions, the share capital
will be enlarged to RM291.15 million from the existing RM17.37
million.
	   The proposed acquisitions and disposals are expected to be
completed by end-January 1999. They are not expected to have any
effect on the earnings of the group for the financial year ending
August 31 1998.
	   However, it is expected to turn around the results of the group
and to contribute positively to earnings in future.
	   On completion of the proposed acquisitions, the parties involved
will collectively own, directly and indirectly, 86.19 per cent in
UPHB, and will be required to make a general offer to the rest of
the UPHB shareholders for the remaining shares they do not already
own for RM1.35 per share.

	   A firm bought some 25,000 tons US wheat for July shipment, an
industry source said yesterday.
	   ``The firm closed a deal for 25,000 tons of US wheat Saturday to
replenish its stocks,'' the source privy to the transaction said,
adding it was the first purchase the company undertook this year.
	   Most local flour millers had reduced their wheat orders since
the start of the year because of a slowdown in local flour
consumption arising from the weak peso.
	   The source said the Philippine flour mill plans to buy the same
quantity of wheat for August shipment if US prices fall from
current levels.

	   GENESIS Micro-Marketing System (GMM), a comprehensive marketing
solution targeted at financial institutions from Austria-based
software house Genesis Software and Consulting, is now available
locally.
	   Launched by local distributor Heb-Ron IT Training and Services
Sdn Bhd (HITTS), GMM is designed to assist financial institutions
in promoting their products in a marketing-driven environment.
	   HITTS' business development director Mathew Avadiar said
financial institutions could be more active in their marketing
activities with GMM.
	   ``The solution is controlled by an organisation's headquarters.
	   Information is created and channelled to respective branches and
from time to time and the data can be monitored from the
headquarters,'' Avadiar told Computimes.
	   ``This way more freedom is offered to the various branches to
market their products,'' he said.
	   GMM has seven core modules: customer information system (CIS),
product information system (PIS), rule system (Rules),
administration assistance, activity support, history database and
statistic module.
	   Avadiar said other modules could be included to support
individual customer requirements. These modules are data mining,
simulation analysis, incentive and promotion control and creating
links to loans systems, securities and insurance databases.
	   ``With the interface that is provided, the other modules will
have a connection to the bank's branch delivery system and the
self-service device system like the automated teller machine
(ATM),'' Avadiar said.
	   ``This includes other links to telephone banking, electronic
banking and Internet banking as well as branch banking.''
	   According to him, GMM can take around one to one-and-a half
years to implement.
	   ``Implemented in stages, the modules will have to be tested as
they are installed. The full-blown system however can take about
five years before it goes live,'' he said.
	   To implement such projects, HITTS is currently working with
computer vendors like IBM, Dell and Unisys, said Avadiar.
	   ``IBM provides its databases and Dell supplies the high-end
servers while Unisys furnishes the readers and the sorters.''
	   Being Genesis' local distributor, HITTS plans to market GMM
through awareness seminars and direct contacts with its customers.
	   Avadiar is confident that HITTS will be able to secure four
installations within the next 12 months. However, he declined to
reveal the potential customers.
	   He added that GMM is in sync with HITTS' business strategies.
	   ``Our focus lies in a very niche area which is the banking and
finance sector. We have taken the trouble to study all the needs
and concerns in this area in an effort to fill in the gaps with the
appropriate solutions.''
	   HITTS currently has eight employees, out of which seven are
technical staff. The team is responsible for customers in Malaysia
and Singapore.
	   A typical GMM solution can cost within the range of DM1 million
(RM2.2 million) to DM5 million.

	   PUBLIC Bank Bhd group's pre-tax profit for the first quarter
ended March 31 1998 nearly quadrupled to RM118.2 million from the
previous quarter, supporting the management's expectations of a
sound and stable year for the banking group.
	   President and chief executive officer Tan Sri Dr Teh Hong Piow
said the bank's pre-tax profit for the quarter increased 62.8 per
cent to RM94.9 million, while that of the group rose 370.3 per cent
to RM118.2 million.
	   The bank's net non-performing ratio stood at 1.07 per cent
compared with 1.06 per cent for December 31 1997. The banking
system average was 7 per cent as at March 31 1998.
	   ``The risk weighted capital ratio of the bank improved from
10.74 per cent for the 1997 financial year to 13.19 per cent as at
March 31 1998.
	   This is above the minimum international standard of 8 per
cent,'' he said in a statement issued after the group's annual
general meeting in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   During the first quarter of the year, shareholders' fund of the
bank grew by 18.4 per cent from RM2.208 billion to RM2.615 billion
and that of the group grew by 12.2 per cent from RM1.876 billion to
RM3.227 billion.
	   For the financial year ended December 31 1997, the group saw
pre-tax profit of RM634.7 million, with earnings per share at 16.6
sen against 24.7 sen in 1996. The group's total assets (excluding
contra items) increased to RM41.9 billion, or 15.9 per cent, from
1996.
	   Teh said the group will continue to manage its operations
prudently to meet the challenges of a difficult economic and
banking environment in 1998.
	   He said the group expects to remain sound and stable with its
proven track record in prudence and asset quality.
	   Teh said Public Bank will soon offer insurance products and
services to its customers under the concept of Bankassurance.
Initially, the bank will introduce two life insurance products to
be sold at selected branches.
	   ``The first product is a Critical Illness Plan to protect
customers against 36 critical illnesses and death and total
permanent disability due to natural or accidental course,'' he
said.
	   The second product is a convertible term plan covering deaths
and total and permanent disability.

	   As the deer pants for the water brooks, so my soul pants for
Thee, O God.- Psalm 42:1
	   Almost everyone goes through a period my friend Marilyn Nelson
describes as the dark hours of the soul. It's when the skies seem
to be brass, and you pray but there's no answer, you cry out,
``Why, God?'' and all you hear is your own echo. Naturally, no one
chooses to face such times, but nearly everyone will, at one time
or another.
	   Madam Guyon wrote many years ago, ``I have learned to love the
darkness of sorrow; there you see the brightness of His face.'' Who
can estimate the good that can come in walking through the dark
hours of the soul? When those hours come upon you, you sometimes
forget what the truth is and begin to wonder whether God has
singled you out for harsh treatment. Here are some guidelines that
may prove profitable in times like these: 1. Remember: God promised
to be with us in trials - not simply to exempt us from them. Micah
cried out: ``When I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto
me'' (7:8 KJV).
	   2. Realize that the sun is still shining - regardless how deep
the gloom is around you. Hold on to the certainty of some things
and take them by faith regardless of what your heart is saying.
	   3. Trust God to accomplish what He pleases, as you face those
unpleasant dark hours. Remember the words of Lottie Cowman from
``Streams in the Desert'': ``Many a rapturous minstrel among those
sons of light,/ will say of His sweetest music - I learned it in
the night/, And many a rolling anthem, that fills the Father's
home,/ Sobbed out its first rehearsal in the shaded of a darkened
room.''
	   Darkness will yield to light and questions to understanding.
``If you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding. . .
Then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the
knowledge of God. . . from His mouth come knowledge and
understanding'' (Prov. 2:3-6 NIV). When you face the dark hours,
you will feel alone; but when you emerge with understanding, you
will find He is sufficient.

	   IT is safe to say that many of us are getting used to the idea
of using an optical device like the compact disk (CD) to store and
retrieve data.
	   There are many different types of CDs that are in use today.
	   From the CD-digital audio (CD-DA) which stores high-quality
music to the video CD (VCD) which stores full-motion movies, the CD
has become an important part of our daily activities.
	   We listen to music with CD-DAs, watch movies with VCDs, play
games with CD-interactives, learn with CD-ROMs and we store data on
CD-Recordable (CD-R) disks.
	   Magneto-optical disk: One of the many different colour books
which are used to distinguish one CD format from another is the
Orange Book.
	   The Orange Book has its name by the colour of the folder in
which the specifications are stored.
	   The Orange Book is divided into three parts.
	   The Orange Book Part 1 is assigned to the magneto-optical disk
(MOD).
	   Although many of us do not regard the MOD as a CD family member,
it is part of the Orange Book.
	   The MOD is able to record information as well as erase
information on the disk.
	   Its storage capacity ranges from 128 megabytes (MB) to eight
gigabytes (GB) of data and its size ranges from a 3.5-inch disk to
a 12-inch disk (refer to Figure 1).
	   The MOD did not enjoy the success of the CD largely due to the
cost involved in buying the drive as well as the disk itself.
	   Unlike a CD-ROM which comes standard on most multimedia personal
computers (PCs), you would rarely find an MO drive installed in a
PC.
	   However, because of its read and write capabilities, the MOD
managed to carve out a niche for itself, especially in the
corporate environment.
	   CD-Recordable: The Orange Book Part II is assigned to the CD-R.
	   The CD-R is one of the more popular CDs aside from the audio CDs
and the CD-ROMs.
	   Unlike the rest of the CD members, the CD-R has the unique
capability of recording data.
	   As long as the data is in digital form, it can be written onto a
CD-R disk.
	   With 650MB of storage space, the CD-R is a complement to its
read-only counterpart, the CD-ROM (refer to Figure 2).
	   The CD-R is used for many purposes. Due to its rather low cost,
the CD-R can be used as a data distribution device for smaller
quantity distributions, say from one to 300 disks.
	   Many multimedia developers now use the CD-R as a means of
testing their applications or as a submission device to mass
duplication plants.
	   In the last few years, the CD-R had the monopoly of the CD
recording market as it was the only recordable CD. Today, this has
changed as a fairly new CD format has emerged.
	   Although the new format has no direct descendant of the original
CD, the CD-DA, it has managed to carve its signature onto CD
history. The new format is known as CD-ReWriteable (CD-RW).
	   CD-RW: The CD-RW is designated in Orange Book Part 3. Originally
known as the CD-Erasable (CD-E), the CD-RW has become the first and
only CD member that can both record and erase data on a single
disk.
	   Released in late 1996, the CD-RW is now gaining recognition in
the marketplace as an alternative storage device to the CD-R.
	   The CD-RW, as its name implies, allows users to record data onto
its disk.
	   Like the CD-R, any digital data can be recorded onto a CD-RW
disk.
	   The data later can be erased to give space for new information
(refer to Figure 3).
	   Unlike the other members of the CD family, the CD-RW uses a
technology known as phase-change technology.
	   Phase-change erases data by allowing the laser beam inside the
CD-RW drive to change the material on the CD-RW disk from amorphic
to crystalline.
	   However, unlike a hard disk or a floppy disk which allows users
to erase or delete files individually, the CD-RW erases all the
previously recorded data on the disk.
	   Essentially, it makes the entire disk empty again. Once the disk
is empty, the recording process can begin again.
	   However, recently, a popular CD-R and CD-RW from Adaptec called
the Direct CD, allows users to record data in packet form.
	   The later version of the Direct CD, known as Direct CD 2.0,
allows for the direct-overwrite feature.
	   The Direct CD software is usually bundled with CD-RW drives.

	   WELCOMING the proposal for the consolidation and merger of unit
trust management companies, the Securities Commission (SC) said any
such initiative should come from the industry.
	   It said any initiative towards this end should come from the
industry based on sound commercial considerations, and not by a
process to be managed or supervised by the SC.
	   The SC was responding to the recommendation by the Federation of
Malaysian Unit Trust Managers (FMUTM) for the consolidation of unit
trust management companies within the industry.
	   ``As announced by the FMUTM on Tuesday, the proposal for the
merger will be contained in a `blueprint' to be submitted to the SC
by the FMUTM soon for its consideration,'' the SC said.
	   However, while no merger process will be initiated by the SC, it
said its Guidelines on Unit Trust Funds require any reconstruction
or amalgamation involving a management company or any change in the
shareholding of a management company to be approved by the SC.
	   On Tuesday, FMUTM president Abdul Azim Mohd Zabidi said it was
finalising a blueprint for the merger of the 35 unit trust
companies in the country.
	   Abdul Azim added that the blueprint will be submitted to the SC
within a week or two. He noted that such an exercise would probably
reduce the number of unit trust companies to about six to eight.
	   However, he did not mention a definite target as to the eventual
number of unit trust companies that will exist after the
consolidation process.
	   In its statement, the SC also highlighted a few important
factors to be considered in any merger process.
	   ``Commercial considerations aside, there are legal and
accounting issues to look into, including the possible need for
unitholders' approval should there be a change in the management
company of the fund and/or the nature and characteristic of the
fund,'' said the SC.
	   It said these issues must be adequately addressed to ensure that
the interests of investors and the industry are maintained and
protected.

	   Big tax evaders with pending cases in court will not be covered
by the amnesty program proposed by President-elect Joseph Estrada.
	   This was emphasized yesterday by incoming Finance secretary
Edgardo Espiritu, in an interview in Malacanang.
	   ``If there are already cases filed in court you cannot subject
that anymore to an amnesty, we have to wait for the court to
decide,'' Espiritu said.
	   Espiritu also stressed that Estrada's proposed amnesty is still
being studied. ``The proposed amnesty is still something that we
will study as I said there is such a thing as an administrative
amnesty that will bring out the underground economy, for example,
and increasing tax base.''
	   The delays in the remittance of tax payments by large
corporations, Espiritu said, could never be justified since they
were required to pay income taxes on a quarterly basis.
	   Meanwhile, Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Commissioner
Liwayway Vinzon-Chato lamented that it would be unfair for big tax
delinquents like Lucio Tan to be covered by the proposed amnesty.
Tan, Chato said, has P29 billion in unsettled accounts.
	   The BIR chief explained that Tan's case should be decided by the
court.
	   Lucio Tan is owner of Fortune Tobacco Corp. and Asia Brewery
Inc. and a major stockholder of Philippine Airlines. Estrada hoped
the amnesty would offset the P8 billion budget deficit.-Marie A.

	   HERE are some of the most common questions on network
terminology.
	   Q: What is a firewall?
	   HERE are some of the most common questions on network
terminology.
	   Q: What is a firewall?
	   A: Electronic fences generated by a computer to protect you from
unauthorised actions from users.
	   Q: What is a local area network (LAN)?
	   A: A computer network where computers are linked by a cable.
LANs are often used by companies to allow members to share files
and applications.
	   LANs are usually machines within a small distance of each other,
as in the same building, due to the limits of being able to link by
coaxial cable.
	   Q: What wiring do LANs use?
	   A: Coaxial cable is a type of wiring which can be used to set up
local area networks on a single bus or line. Twisted pair-wiring is
a type of wiring which can be used to set up local area networks
using a hub. This is generally called a Star.
	   Q: What is an intranet?
	   A: A private network which uses Internet technology so that
people can exchange electronic mail (e-mail), store files and chat
with each other.
	   Q: What is an extranet?
	   A: Firewall-to-firewall connection between two or more intranets
allowing only authorised requests from certain addresses. In
effect, it is joined intranets.
	   Q: What is a protocol?
	   A: An agreed-upon format or set of rules for transmitting data
between two devices.
	   Q: What does Ethernet mean?
	   A: The Ethernet protocol developed by Xerox Corp in co-operation
with Digital Equipment Corp and Intel Corp in 1976 is the most
popular base for LANs.
	   Q: What is TCP/IP?
	   A: The transmission control protocol (TCP) on top of the
Internet protocol (IP) which allows the Internet to work. The
Internet protocol is a connectionless protocol which provides
packet (data) routing. TCP is connection-oriented and provides
reliable communication and multi-plexing.
	   Q: What is OSI ?
	   A: The Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) reference model is the
International Standards Organisation (ISO) structure for the
``ideal''
	   network architecture which allows computer systems made by
different vendors to communicate with each other.
	   This model outlines seven areas, or layers, for the network.
These layers, from highest to lowest, are: 7. Applications: Where
the user applications software lie. Such issues as file access and
transfer, virtual terminal emulation, inter-process communication
and the likes are handled here.
	   6. Presentation: Differences in data representation are dealt
with at this level. For example, Unix-style line endings (CR only)
might be converted to MS-DOS style (CRLF), or EBCIDIC to ASCII
character sets.
	   5. Session: Communications between applications across a network
is controlled at the session layer. Testing for out-of-sequence
packets and handling two-way communication are handled here.
	   4. Transport: Makes sure the lower three layers are doing their
job correctly. It also provides a transparent and logical data
stream between the end user and the network service used. This is
the lower layer that provides local user services.
	   3. Network: This layer makes certain that a packet sent from one
device to another actually gets there in a reasonable period of
time. Routing and flow control are performed here. This is the
lowest layer of the OSI model that can remain ignorant of the
physical network.
	   2. Data link: Deals with getting data packets on and off the
wire, error detection and correction and retransmission. This layer
is broken into two sub-layers; the Logical Link Control (LLC) on
the upper half, which does the error checking and the Medium Access
Control (MAC) on the lower half, which gets the data on and off the
wire.
	   1. Physical: The nuts and bolts layer. It defines the cable,
connector and signalling specifications.

	   HYGIENE used to be one of the subjects offered when I was in
school. The subject was not entirely interesting in the way it was
taught but it was still useful. Much of what I know about hygiene I
learnt from the teachers in school.
	   Today, you can learn hygiene in a different, more interesting
way. A Vim Hygiene Advisory Service (http://www.vim-advisory. com/)
was recently launched on the World Wide Web. The primary objectives
of the Web site are ``to help families protect themselves from
germs'' and provide the ``latest information about good and simple,
hygiene habits and how to stop the growth and spread of harmful
germs to ensure homes are hygienically clean''.
	   What do you think? Of course, the bigger objective of the site
is to promote Vim products for use all around the house.
	   Nevertheless, the service and information offered as part of
this promotion are a commendable effort by Unilever.
	   The advisors available on the site are experts in the field. I
was pleased to know that they also include a few of my previous
colleagues at the university along with experts from other local
universities, a research institute and a hospital. Find out who
they are by clicking on ``Your Personal Advisor''.
	   E-mail your concerns by filling in the electronic form provided
and you will receive a reply from the panel.
	   And you know what? If your letter is selected, you will receive
a hamper of Unilever products. How about that! I enjoyed the way
information was put together such as in the ``Home Sweet Home''
section. Here, you can learn about hygiene in the bedroom, kitchen,
living room, bathroom, dining room, porch, driveway, garden,
storeroom and backyard.
	   What's interesting is that each of these rooms or areas is
represented by an illustration which you can click on in order to
receive information about keeping that particular item or area
germ-free or how to manage the cleaning better. For example, click
on ``glassware'' in the kitchen and you will be informed that,
``When two glasses are stuck together, fill the top one with cold
water and dip the bottom one in hot water''.
	   Or when you click on ``stainless steel sink,'' you will learn,
among others, ``Don't let dishes soak in the sink as it is the
perfect condition for bacterial growth''. The information, as you
can see from the two responses above, is quite basic. However, it
may not be common knowledge for everyone. Thus, we can still learn
quite a bit and find the information useful.
	   ``Kiddo's World'' is another interesting section at the site.
Learn about infections among children which can be contracted
through family members, pets, insects and food. There are hygiene
tips for babies and toddlers.
	   Another great section for fathers and mothers who are
responsible for preparing food in the home is the ``Healthy
Eating'' section. Discover how food poisoning can occur in the
home. Learn about how to prepare, cook and store food at home.
There is plenty of information and useful tips in this section. I
found this section very enlightening.
	   Also, you should find out about how to keep pests out. Ants,
flies, rats and cockroaches are creatures that can affect your
health. Click on ``Keeping the Pests Out'' to understand how to
keep them out of your home.
	   A section titled, ``Hot Tips of the Month'' gives information on
hygiene during a water crisis.
	   There are tips on storing water, using water for consumption and
some other points of wisdom. Find out what they are! And if you are
keen to know more about hygiene, the ``What's Happening''
	   section has a list of feature articles published in one of the
local newspapers. If you missed the articles, you can request for
free copies of them. What a great service! In addition, there are
other things you can request for by filling up a questionnaire and
sending it back to them electronically. This is, incidentally, a
good way to collect information about consumers in exchange for a
service that will benefit them.
	   The questionnaire includes queries such as the product brands
that respondents are currently using, favourite TV channel,
favourite radio station, newspaper and magazine.
	   The approach of getting information from consumers is becoming
more and more common online.
	   However, the biggest regret I have about this site is that most
of the graphics, especially those of people, failed to reflect that
it is a local site. The graphics are more representative of Mat
Sallehs rather than Asians! What a pity.
	   Anyway, happy surfing!

	   Australia has expressed concern over reports that Manila plans
to raise tariffs on manufactured goods, particularly dairy products
and pharmaceuticals.
	   In a letter to the Philippine Tariff Commission, Australian
Ambassador to the Philippines Miles Kupa said his government was
worried over proposed changes in the Philippines' tariff structure
this year.
	   ``As you would appreciate, the recent financial instability and
the depreciation of the peso have increased costs significantly for
importers and companies reliant on imported inputs. In this
context, any move towards increasing tariffs might well undermine
business and investor confidence in the Philippines,'' Kupa said in
a letter to Tariff Commission Chair Emmanuel Velasco.
	   Sydney is particularly keen on tariffs on dairy products.
Australia is the Philippines' biggest supplier of dairy products.
	   ``We consider it important that these products remain accessible
to the broader population despite inflationary pressures,'' said
Kupa.
	   Government has set the tariff on concentrated milk at 3% until
2000.
	   After completing tariff changes covering 22 ``industry
winners,'' the Tariff Commission has started reviewing import
levies on various manufactured goods.
	   A government source said the commission had yet to receive a
petition to raise tariffs on dairy products.
	   Australia is also interested in plans to include pharmaceutical
products in the ``early voluntary sectoral liberalization'' of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   Kupa said Australia welcomed government's decision to reduce
duties on imported beef.

	   AJINOMOTO (Malaysia) Bhd is anticipating a slightly higher group
turnover of RM135 million for the current financial year, against a
turnover of RM124.50 million in the previous corresponding year.
	   The group also expects contributions from its export markets to
increase to 25 per cent of total sales turnover from the current 20
per cent.
	   Currently, Ajinomoto's core export markets are West Asia,
Singapore and Sri Lanka.
	   However, the group is also making inroads into the lucrative
Chinese market with its Tencho (a naturally derived food seasoning)
product.
	   Ajinomoto's managing director Yasushi Akasaka was speaking to
reporters after the company's annual general meeting in Kuala
Lumpur yesterday.
	   To cater for the expected increase in demand, the group has
allocated some RM8.69 million for the current year to increase its
production capacity by 15 per cent.
	   He said initially, Ajinomoto had allocated RM11.69 million for
its expenditure programme.
	   However, due to the weakening of the ringgit against the
greenback and the general slowdown in the economy, the group
decided to cut its capital expenditure plan by RM3 million.
	   The fall in the ringgit's value against the US dollar has also
affected the group's bottomline.
	   Its forecast pre-tax profit for the current year is expected to
be slightly lower than the RM7.94 million registered last year.
	   Yasushi said the expected fall in pre-tax profit is because the
cost of Ajinomoto's imported raw materials has spiralled up by 50
per cent.
	   He said the company currently sources up to 40 per cent of its
raw materials from overseas.
	   He also said that early this year, the company had to increase
the price of Ajinomoto by 2 to 3 per cent due to the high cost it
had to bear.
	   Asked if the group will further increase the price of their
products, Yasushi said that in the event the ringgit is at the
RM3.60 to RM3.80 (to the dollar), the group will be able to
maintain its current policies.
	   However, if the ringgit were to go above the RM4 level, the
possibility of a price increase cannot be discounted.
	   At the moment, the group is still keeping its options open and
has no new pricing policy in place.
	   Meanwhile, Yasushi said Ajinomoto will be introducing a new
seasoning under the Aji-Shio range, called Aji-Shio Premium
Flavoured Chilli, by the middle of this year.
	   He said the Aji-Shio Premium Flavoured Chilli comes in two sizes
- the 35g and 60g bottle. The small bottle will be priced at RM2 a
bottle, while the larger one will be priced at RM3 a bottle.

	   THERE is no getting away from the fact that in most chat groups
most netizens are Western and that the lingua franca tends to be
English. In this article, we will take a look at some popular
places where Malaysians and other Asians congregate.
	   Accessed by browsers: WBS Asia Room (http://www.wbs.net): WBS
chat supports coloured text, graphics and taglines. Registration is
a pest but membership is free. At certain times of the day, chat
here is very slow so be prepared to know which time of day is best
for you.
	   The Asia Room starts to be busy late afternoon. The people in
the Asia room are very nice and welcoming to newbies. The common
language tends to be English but a little Malay and Indonesian are
spoken occasionally.
	   Topics discussed here vary hugely.
	   The Malaysian Room is frequented mainly by students living
abroad. The inmates here are friendly but impatient with those
whose Malay is weak. If this is your problem, you will have a hard
time keeping up with some of the more rapid conversationalists.
Favourite topics here are food, studying and private family news.
	   The Chinese Room is visited by people from all over the world so
the preferred language tends to be English. The room is home to
American-born Chinese more than any other group but some Malaysians
are trickling in.
	   Anyone is welcome here and newbies are kindly received.
	   The Filipino Room is very busy in the afternoons and early
mornings. The main language here is Tagalog, although English is
also understood and accepted. Main topics here are local Philippine
issues, family news and entertainment news. Fun room to watch as
ThE tEXt is ALl hIgGleTY PigGLeTy.
	   Yahoo! Chat Asian-Americans (http://chat. yahoo.com/): Despite
the name of this room, it is busy day and night with a wide-ranging
loose-knit group. Here you will find students who are studying away
from home eager to chat in their native language, and foreign
students taking a degree in Asian studies as well as Asian
Americans who want to chat to people living in Asia. The language
here tends to be English with some Malay and Tagalog spoken
especially in the evenings.
	   Sarawak Talk (http:/www.malaysia.net/sarawalk/): Sarawak Talk is
extremely popular among Sarawakians, with posts flooding in around
4pm and after 10pm. This is not really chat, more a newsgroup.
However, people treat it as a chat room and at peak times posts fly
in at top speed. The biggest topic of conversation here is
political scandal. This is not a place for the sensitive or easily
embarrassed! Many posts on Sarawak talk are the virtual equivalent
of poison pen letters with the moderators quite content to leave
messages accusing private and public individuals (complete with
name, address and workplace) of horrendous crimes. If you are new,
it is advisable you do not copy the style of these messages in any
other newsgroup or chat room as you will be kicked off.
	   Accessed by Internet relay chat (IRC): For this, you need to
download a software program. If you don't have one I suggest you
try mIRC available for 30-day trial from Tucows at
http://tucows.cdc.com.
	   my/tucows/index.html.
	   The mIRC is a shareware IRC client for Windows. It is developed
and copyrighted by Khaled Mardam-Bey. Read the manual to find out
how the package works and don't forget to register it if you decide
to keep it! At the following channels you will find that the Malay
language is the lingua franca: Asiacafe - through DALnet; Bandar -
through Undernet; Gayasian - through Undernet; Kampung - through
Undernet; Kelate - through Undernet; RiNDu - through Undernet; and
Warisan - through Undernet.
	   Looking for Malaysian ICQ users: I prefer to search for people
using the White pages but it does take some time and effort. If you
are in a hurry and can't stand the wait, look at http://www.
geocities.com/CollegePark /Union/7246/ for a list of Malaysian ICQ
members.
	   Warning: This page has an embedded sound fileand so many
graphics that it takes ages to download.
	   Good luck and happy chatting! Any feedback? Contact Grover at
grover &LR; ace.cdc. abu.com.

	   K&AMP;N Kenanga Bhd's subsidiary, Kenanga Investment Management Sdn
Bhd (KIM), a joint venture foreign fund management company between
K&AMP;N Kenanga and Rothschild Asset Management International Holdings
B.V. (RAM BV), is expected to get approval for its unit trust fund
later this year.
	   KIM had already submitted an application to the Securities
Commission (SC) and expects to start operations immediately upon
receiving approval, said Ms Jill Smith, managing director of
Rothschild Asset Management (Singapore) Ltd.
	   However, the company does not want to put a specific figure on
the size of the fund, which will be a Malaysian equity fund with a
focus on companies with strong franchises and good leadership.
	   On whether it is a good time to release a unit trust, Smith said
that as the focus is on quality ``it should be able to stimulate
some interest''.
	   ``We feel we can be one of the top players in the (unit trust)
market in the long term,'' said Encik Johan Tazrin Hamid Ngo,
executive director of the joint venture company.
	   The joint venture also aims to transfer technology and train
local fund managers, he added.
	   Both were speaking to reporters after a media briefing to
announce the signing of the shareholders agreement to form the
joint venture company.
	   A memorandum of understanding was initially signed last October.
	   The company, which is subject to the approvals of the SC and the
Foreign Investment Committee, will be held 60 per cent by K&AMP;N
Kenanga and 40 per cent by RAM BV.
	   It will provide professional fund management services to
institutional, corporate and retail clients; manage local and
offshore funds for investment in Malaysian, regional and
international equities and fixed income securities.
	   The unit trust further hopes to channel new funds from existing
clients of K&AMP;N Kenanga Asset Management Sdn Bhd (KAM), said Smith.
	   KAM, which started operations in January, already has RM20
million under management locally with 72 per cent of funds invested
in equity stocks.

	   Regardless of how you might feel for the title, believe me: this
little 90-minute gem is one heck of a good play. It should have had
a longer run.
	   There is very little plot development in this play, but it does
have very strong characterizations, powerful individual
performances, and dynamic character interplays. The script is also
evocative and touching. It makes you laugh and weep, cringe and
cheer, all at the same time. The writer does know his characters
and the conflicting worlds and cultures from which they come.
Flipzoids poses a question, does not pretend to give an answer, but
does leave a sense of hope -- and yet, this hope can even be
ambiguous.
	   The fulcrum of the play is Aying, an old Filipina immigrant in
Southern California who spends her days by the beach reminiscing
about Pagudpod, the old town from where she came. Her only
daughter, Vangie, now a nurse in California, has become a stranger.
Bent on adapting to and becoming successful in her new country,
Vangie admittedly has forgotten the life she has left in the
Philippines. She has also become a stranger to her mother.
	   Eventually, she leaves the old woman in a nursing home; Aying
clams up and becomes a recluse until she dies.
	   Aying, however, makes the acquaintance of Redford, a Gen-X
Filipino who grew up in the US since he was seven years old.
Redford knows nothing of his parents' former home and culture, and
spends his time in the beaches' toilet stalls explaining his angst
and mixed upbringing to the unmindful occupants next door. Both
lost and looking for a home they could never find, Aying and
Redford stumblingly try to ``connect'' with each other.
	   Aying unsuccessfully tries to impart to Redford the stories
about Pagudpod as her last inheritance. Redford cannot make any
sense of these stories, but somehow persists in asking the old
woman to teach him some words from the old country. Aying asks for
Redford's help to understand her daughter, while he asks Aying to
help him understand his mixed culture. Both fail to help each
other.
	   In the end, when Aying dies, Redford remains at the beach,
attempting to piece together an identity he can live with. But even
this touching glimpse of hope is ambiguous. When Redford asks the
old woman how to say ``I love you'' in Filipino, Aying, as a joke,
tells him, ``Pangit ako.'' And ``Pangit ako'' is the pitiful mantra
that Redford recites unknowingly as the lights on stage dim.
	   A play with long dialogues and little action runs the risks of
boring its audience. But the lines in this play do touch its
audience. The absurdity in the linguistic confusions, the clash
brought about by the diverse generation gaps, the hurt and pain
caused by the inability of the characters to understand one
another---they're all real enough. And the author didn't have to
create long existential monologues to drive home his point. The
language was so natural it was believable, and in that simplicity
lay its profundity.
	   While the characters are familiar enough -- the immigrant
trying-hard Nurse, the old woman who cannot leave her ways, the
Gen-X hybrid -- they remain individuals. There are no black and
white caricatures in this play.
	   There are neither heroes nor villains. While Aying does draw the
audience sympathy, she does not become the savior and tower of
wisdom to the lost young man. She cannot help Redford because she,
too, does not understand her situation. Vangie's exasperation and
seeming indifference to her mother's plight comes not from a cruel
and selfish heart, but from a wounded one -- that of a daughter who
worked so hard to give her mother all that they had dreamt of when
they were in the Philippines, but now finds that her mother rejects
those dreams. Redford may seem lost, but this pathetic, yet funny
kid who talks to men in the toilets is not dumb or stupid -- he's
witty, intelligent, wise, and serious enough to undertake the quest
for his own identity.
	   For her portrayal of Aying, it's no wonder that Ching
Valdes-Aran won the 1997 Obie (Off-Broadway) Award. When he's
onstage, Ken Leung as Redford is totally in command. As the acting
narrator, he manages to hold the audience's attention and shift it
to his or any of the character's focus.
	   Mia Katigbak's Vangie creeps into the audience. At first the
most unsympathetic of the three characters, her motivations become
startlingly and painfully clear and realistic -- and the one scene
that finally explains the explosive rupture that destroyed all her
bridges with her mother is the play's most powerful one.
	   The New York-based Ma-Yi Theater Company's first presentation to
the Manila audience was a fantastic premiere. May it be a portent
of more wonderful theatrical pieces to come.

	   THE Government may be forced to reassess the target date for
broad deployment of the smart school implementation if the present
economic fluctuations continue. Deputy Education Minister Datuk
Khalid Yunus said while the project would undoubtedly still be
carried out, it would be done more conservatively and at a much
slower pace.
	   ``We may have to adjust certain things like the number of
equipment or computer laboratories allocated for each school to
suit the Government's allocation. When the economy gets back to
normal, things will be back at full speed,'' he added.
	   The broad deployment of the project, as spelt out in the
Malaysian Smart School Implementation Plan document dated July
1997, is year 2010.
	   According to Khalid, despite the uncertainties in the current
economy, preparations for the smart school flagship application
rollout are well underway. He said the Education Ministry is in the
midst of upgrading the 81 selected existing schools which have been
identified to become pilot smart schools. ``The upgrading project
should be completed by November.
	   Each of the schools has been allocated some RM94,000 for that
purpose.
	   These 81 schools along with the nine new purpose-built smart
schools should be ready for project deployment by Jan 1, 1999,'' he
told reporters in Petaling Jaya on Monday.
	   Of the 90 schools, five are primary schools and 85 are secondary
schools, all of which are slotted to be models and benchmarks for
the other schools in the country.
	   Khalid had earlier officiated the pre-launching ceremony of an
interactive multimedia CD-ROM series called Siri Sahabat Rimba.
	   A result of a smart partnership between Galeri Ilmu Sdn Bhd
(GISB), Felda Prodata Systems Sdn Bhd and Raihan Corporation, Siri
Sahabat Rimba comprises animated storybooks which come in two
versions - English and Bahasa Melayu.
	   GISB provided the story content and illustrations, Felda Prodata
the technical aspects while popular nasyid group Raihan provided
the voices for the narration.
	   Felda Prodata's executive director Azizan Abd Rahman said the
CD-ROMs, which took eight months to develop, are targeted at
children from pre- schoolers to 12-year-olds.
	   ``There are three CD-ROMs in the series, with two stories and
their related activities in each one. When a buyer purchases one of
the CD-ROMs, he will receive four accompanying storybooks - two in
English and two in Bahasa Melayu,'' said Azizan.
	   The stories are based on local folk tales with moral lessons.
The accompanying activities include games like crossword puzzles
and karaoke sing-along sessions.
	   GISB's group chief editor Abu Hassan Morad said the first CD-ROM
in the series comprising stories Jarum Nabi Sulaiman and Berpegang
Pada Janji will be made available nationwide next month.
	   This will be followed by the introduction of the other two
CD-ROMs which contain stories such as Filun Anak Gajah Yang Nakal
and Katak Bawah Tempurung, and Asal Usul Kasturi and Mengapa Itik
Terbang Rendah.
	   ``The targeted retail price is RM39.90 per CD-ROM. We hope by
the end of next year, we would have sold some 100,000 units,'' Abu
Hassan said, adding that the target was possible as they based the
projection on Raihan's popularity.
	   The tripartite alliance will approach the Education Ministry to
market the CD-ROMs in schools, especially smart schools, as
value-added teaching- cum-learning material.
	   ``We also plan to market the CD-ROMs through dealers
nationwide,'' he said. There are also plans to offer the CD-ROMs to
the international market.

	   THE Securities Commission (SC) has set the ball rolling for
greater foreign participation in the local stockbroking industry by
proposing that the ceiling for foreign ownership in broking firms
be raised to a maximum of 70 per cent from the present 49 per cent.
	   The key word relating to the proposal - announced by SC chairman
Datuk Dr Mohd Munir Majid on Monday - is ``limited''.
	   Thus, it may not be far wrong to assume that the offer, if
implemented, is open only to foreigners keen to take over any of
the ailing stockbroking companies.
	   Given the pace of events in the local stockbroking industry and
the continuous slide in the local bourse, foreigners may have quite
a stable to pick from.
	   The suggestion, if it comes to fruition, will basically enable
foreigners, who until now have played a backseat role in the local
stockbroking industry through joint ventures, to participate more
actively, thus generating a higher level of expertise and healthy
competitiveness.
	   But this begs the question: Why would foreign companies take up
the ailing brokerages if strong local companies, brokerages or
otherwise, are not too keen to do so?
	   Let's face it - the proposal to increase foreign ownership comes
only after the failure to entice local companies to take over
ailing broking firms which have been tottering due to scarce
capital and escalating cost of borrowings, strangling any hope of
recovery they may have in the near future.
	   Analysts have said that foreign companies will surely accept the
carrot offered to them if they look at the development of the local
bourse over the years, which has been most impressive.
	   The local stock exchange has more than doubled in size,
sophistication and technology since its inception in 1973.
	   From a market capitalisation of merely RM70 million in 1987, the
bourse had grown in leaps and bounds to chalk up a record market
capitalisation of RM786.92 billion at the end of 1996.
	   However, due to the economic problems which have hit the country
since last July, the KLSE's market capitalisation at the end of
1997 stood at RM367.61 billion. Still, this marks an impressive
growth performance.
	   The previous three boom-and-bust periods since the 1970s served
as a catalyst for change and improvement, and it will be no
different this time round for the stockbroking industry.
	   The Pan-Electric debacle and the crisis that ensued crippled
many well- established broking houses in November 1985 which led to
a wave of measures aimed at strengthening the infrastructure and
financial capability of the industry.
	   It leaves one with no doubt that after this present turmoil all
that's left of the broking industry in the country will be strong,
resilient entities set to ride high when things pick up - and this
should be enticing enough for any foreigner (or local) with
foresight to take advantage of now.
	   Local brokerages with adequate capital are grudgingly stepping
forward to take over or merge with entities in dire straits as,
unlike the foreigners, they already have a substantial piece of the
cake.
	   The Government has maintained the stand that there will not be a
significant relaxation in the country's policies in the financial
services sector for the time being.
	   Instead, there has been a strong call for the sector to
consolidate through mergers, in preparation for liberalisation.
	   Clearly, this strategy has not been fruitful in the stockbroking
industry, as there has been scarcely any attempts by stronger
companies to resuscitate brokerages that have buckled under
pressure.
	   Thus, as an alternative, the SC has proposed that foreigners be
allowed to control 70 per cent of a local brokerage.
	   What is more appealing is that the SC's proposal does not
require the foreigners to reduce their holdings after a certain
period of time, unlike what was recently implemented in the
telecommunications sector.
	   Encouraging greater foreign participation in the stockbroking
industry will be a fresh change and perhaps just what the industry
needs to move a step closer to being recognised as a world-class
exchange.
	   In addition, foreign participation in the stockbroking industry
will balance the scale of retail-institutional investors which at
the moment leans heavily towards the retail side.
	   While there already exists a pool of remisiers to cater to
retail needs, foreign-owned brokerages will be able to enhance and
draw the participation of institutional investors - a move the
Government has long awaited.
	   Yet, another remedy is the reimbursement scheme put forward by
the Securities Commission whereby strong local brokerages are
encouraged to come forth to reimburse clients of a stockbroking
firm which has had its licence revoked.
	   The sweetener is that the brokerage company will then be allowed
to set up a branch or branches depending on the amount committed.
	   But what is a fair price to set up another branch? Is the RM70
million forked out by Hwang-DBS in the case of Omega Securities
which enables it to set up one in Shah Alam a fair price?
	   In addition, such ``enticements'' are applicable only once a
licence has been revoked. Thus far, only the licence of Omega
Securities has been revoked. So when Munir called on other
brokerages to come forth and participate in the scheme, can we
assume that there will be more companies going under?
	   Munir was clearly disappointed that the strong large brokerages
approached by the SC to merge with or acquire any of the weak ones
has not shown much enthusiasm. He said several of them were merely
interested in merging with or taking over the stronger entities.
	   This brings to mind earlier arguments that instead of coming up
with cures that do not seem to suit the illness (only because there
seems to be no takers), perhaps the weak entities should be allowed
to die a natural death.
	   It may do a great deal of damage to sentiments for a while,
particularly at a time when most are treading on eggshells. But
wouldn't it do more harm than good to extend their lives ... or to
delay their fate?

	   The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yesterday urged the
Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) to defer the launching of the small
and medium scale enterprise (SME) board until the sponsorship and
listing cost issues are cleared.
	   Brokers and exchange department (BED) head Elizabeth Martin said
that a letter had been sent to PSE President Jose Luis Yulo Jr.
explaining that further studies were needed before the SMEs could
be listed and traded.
	   ``The sponsorship issue should first be cleared as sponsors
would be the ones to guarantee the viability of the companies to be
listed,'' Martin said.
	   She pointed out questions on qualifications and liability of the
sponsor should first be settled.
	   The local bourse has not given much information about the
supposed sponsors except to say that SMEs need them to qualify for
listing, and that corporate firms, universal banks or investment
houses could act as sponsors for at least two years on SMEs that
plan to list.
	   Martin also questioned the cost of listing as companies going
into an initial public offering (IPO) usually have to set aside 20%
of the proceeds from the offering to pay underwriters, legal
advisers, and public relation advisers among others.
	   Yulo had proposed to the PSE Board that the Exchange help SMEs
on the listing cost, admitting these companies will have to pay at
least 15 different entities before they can be listed.
	   Martin said she was only objecting the soft launch which the
local bourse will undertake next week for the SME board.
	   ``We are not opposing its creation, we only want it deferred,''
she said.
	   Martin said the BED and SEC's money market operation department
(MMOD) will study further the proposed SME board.
	   ``We will come out with a common stand on the issue,'' the BED
chief said.
	   The PSE is planning to start the SME board in the fourth quarter
of the year as its third board. SMEs to be listed must have a
market capitalization of P20 million to P90 million with top
priority given to export-oriented manufacturing firms.
	   A PSE study showed there are more than 7,500 registered SMEs
approximating 30% of the country's gross national product. SMEs
have a total capitalization of P93.60 billion. IPOs of these
companies are estimated to bring in a market capitalization of
P125.60 billion.
	   The PSE was supposed to create the SME board in partnership with
the Small Business Guarantee Financing Corp. until talks bogged
down late last year.

	   NEWBORN ... The Malacca Zoo in Ayer Keroh has a new ``star
attraction'' - a baby giraffe which was born early this month.
	   Zoo public relations officer Masri Arop said the baby giraffe,
weighing 25kg and standing 1.5 metres at birth, has been named
Ayah. Its parents are Anne and Masai.
	   There are three male and six female giraffes at the zoo.
	   Masri hoped companies would ``adopt'' the animals by taking care
of their upkeep. ``In spite of the economic slowdown, we hope
companies will continue sponsoring the animals.''

	   THE price of the Astro Direct-to-U or DtU system will be
increased to RM1,199 from the present RM999, effective July 1 this
year.
	   In announcing the price increase, Astro executive director Mr
C.Y. Chin attributed it to the 60 per cent fall in the ringgit
since late last year.
	   He added that despite savings from lower manufacturing costs,
DtU systems are becoming increasingly costly.
	   ``Since the launch of the service, Astro has been subsidising
the DtU systems to make them more affordable to Malaysians,'' Chin
told reporters at Astro's briefing for the media and dealers in
Petaling Jaya yesterday.
	   He said the company has spent RM100 million on hardware
subsidies so far. Even with the new price, Astro will continue to
subsidise each DtU system heavily.
	   Astro's programming costs, he said, have also been rising.
However, Astro's monthly subscription of RM80 or RM2.67 per day
will remain to ensure the service remains affordable to as many
Malaysians as possible.
	   Since its launch in October 1996, Astro has added a number of
new value- added services at no additional cost to subscribers,
Chin said, adding that the new services include the premium sports
service, Astro SuperSport.
	   Astro currently has 185,000 subscribers nationwide who enjoy
access to 22 television channels (excluding TV1 and TV2) and eight
radio services, all digital, he said.
	   At the function Chin also announced that Astro will be giving
away over RM1 million in prizes and rewards to consumers and
dealers who take part in two nationwide contests.

	   The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) said yesterday reserve
money in the first quarter exceeded expectations as it fell below
the ceiling set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by about
P20 billion.
	   Reserve money is a major component of base money, which refers
to the sum of total currency issues, reserve balances of banks and
reserve eligibles for government securities.
	   This indicator influences inflation.
	   In an interview, BSP Director for Economic Research Diwa
Gunigundo attributed the ``over-performance'' to ``appropriately
tight monetary policies'' of the central bank.
	   Gunigundo declined to speculate that there would be a change in
the country's inflation target this year with the IMF review
scheduled this August.
	   Under the memorandum of economic and financial program it signed
with the IMF, the Philippines is targeting a 7.5% to 8.5% inflation
rate for 1998.
	   The memorandum outlined conditions attached to a $1.4-billion
precautionary fund that the IMF is extending to the Philippines.
	   There were reports that with the inflation rate hitting
double-digit figures, the country might seek changes in the
program.
	   Last May, the inflation rate reached 10.3%.
	   Inflation is a process in which the average level of prices
increases at a substantial rate over a considerable period of time.
In short, more money is required each year to buy a given amount of
goods and services. One can measure the rate of inflation as either
the annual percentage rate of increase in the average price level
or decrease in the value of money.
	   ``I do not discount the possibility of fine-tuning the
program...but we have substantially secured monetary policies,''
said Gunigundo.
	   He added it was unlikely there would be changes in banks'
intermediation costs that could further push up inflation.
	   ``It is not yet advisable as of this time because lowering the
reserves increases liquidity in the system that causes higher
inflation... Of course, we can always mop it up but still this is
very expensive,'' he said.
	   The Monetary Board decided to cut the statutory reserve
requirement of banks to 8% from 10% and raise the interest-bearing
portion of this instrument from 25% to 40% to bring down banks'
intermediation costs.
	   The central bank said with the lower intermediation cost, banks
should be able to cut their spread over the benchmark 91-day
treasury bill (T-bill) from a range of 2% to 7% to between 1.5% and
6%.

	   APEX Equity Holdings Bhd, which has proposed to extend the
subscription period for its outstanding warrants, says the
extension is beneficial for the company as it will extend the life
of an existing fund-raising instrument in the market.
	   It said the warrants are regarded as a fund-raising instrument
which will provide the company with necessary infusion of cash for
working capital requirements.
	   Apex Equity has proposed that the subscription period of the
warrants be extended from June 27 1998 to June 27 1999.
	   The capital injection that will follow with the exercise of the
warrants represents a good avenue for the company to raise working
capital at a low cost, it said.
	   On the assumption that all outstanding warrants are exercised,
the company will receive RM126.275 million in subscription
proceeds.
	   It said the extension is necessary in view of the current
economic conditions, which give an uncertain and bearish outlook on
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's performance in general.
	   The Securities Commission has approved the proposal. The company
is now seeking approvals from its shareholders, it said in a
circular dated May 20.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - The lack of rain for the past two days has
again caused the combined production level of three Sungai Langat
water treatment plants to plunge to just above half their normal
capacities.
	   The Sungai Langat, Cheras and Ampang Intake water treatment
plants today managed a combined production level of only 54.2 per
cent, down from a high of 92.7 per cent on Friday.
	   ``The drop was caused by the lack of rain and we have to control
water releases from the dams to conserve water,'' said Selangor
Waterworks Department deputy director V.Subramaniam today.
	   In Seremban, Menteri Besar Tan Sri Mohamad Isa Abdul Samad said
the State Government would continue with the water rationing
exercise as there had been no improvement in the water level at the
Sungai Terip dam.
	   He said the State could only cancel the rationing exercise once
the water level increased above its normal level of 94 metres.
	   He said the present water level of 91 metres was still
insufficient for the State Water Supply Department to resume
24-hour water supply to consumers.
	   The department will undertake a pioneer tube well project at
Kampung Paroi in Pancor here tomorrow. It will be capable of
supplying between 1.125 and 1.8 million litres of water daily to
Taman Tasik Jaya and its neighbouring areas.
	   Mohamad Isa said the department was expected to dig four tube
wells to facilitate the additional water supply.
	   The department will also undertake a similar project in Tanah
Merah, Port Dickson soon.

	   ACF Holdings Bhd has proposed a revision of its profit guarantee
provided by its major shareholders Trillionvest Sdn Bhd, Amsteel
Corp Bhd and Lion Corp Bhd, following the proposed acquisition of a
33.6 per cent stake by Affin Holdings Bhd.
	   Affin announced its proposed acquisition in March and upon
completion, it will be required to make a mandatory general offer
for the remaining shares in ACF it does not already own, including
the equity interests of Amsteel (12.29 per cent) and Lion Corp
(16.57 per cent) in ACF.
	   Consequently, Affin will emerge as the controlling shareholder
of ACF and is expected to take over the management of ACF.
	   ACF is proposing a revision of the profit guarantee agreement
for the financial year ended December 31 1997, from RM63.31 million
to RM43.28 million, in view of certain principal assumptions used
in arriving at the profit guarantee being rendered inapplicable due
to the changes in the guidelines of Bank Negara Malaysia, and a
full discharge of the profit guarantee of RM46.96 million for
financial years 1998 and 1999.
	   The ACF group achieved an unaudited pre-tax profit of RM41
million for the year ended December 31 1997, against a profit
guarantee of RM63.31 million.
	   Of that difference, RM20.03 million is due to the effects of
Bank Negara's new guidelines on general provisions, which include
increasing general provisions by 0.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent and
reclassifying loans as non-performing when they are three months
overdue instead of six.
	   The rest of the shortfall in the profits of RM2.28 million was
attributed to the unexpected economic turmoil in the second half of
the year, which resulted in higher funding costs for the group, but
the guarantors said they will fulfil their obligations to
compensate the company for that amount.
	   The proposals will not have any effect on the earnings of the
company.

	   JOHOR Land Bhd (JLB) will endeavour to meet challenging times in
a proactive and responsible manner in view of lower group profits
and sales for the last financial year ending December 31 1998.
	   In his annual statement, JLB chairman Datuk Muhammad Ali Hashim
says the group will mainly rely on projects launched in 1996 and
1997 to bring in revenue from the 2,552 units of mixed property
under development - of which 50 per cent has been sold.
	   The remaining unsold portion, which are the low- to medium-cost
houses and flats, is expected to be more marketable over the next
few years.
	   In addition, JLB's ongoing projects located in strategic areas
are expected to contribute towards the group's earnings in the
coming years.
	   For the financial year ended December 31 1997, the group
recorded a pre- tax profit of RM26.09 million compared with RM36.09
million in 1996.
	   Turnover fell 20.6 per cent to RM111.34 million for the
financial year under review.
	   At company level, pre-tax profit was RM17.12 million, a drop of
41 per cent from the previous year. Turnover and after-tax profit
were RM86.71 million and RM10.77 million, respectively, for 1997.
	   The group intends to be prudent in its activities and will
further improve its operating efficiency and enhance cost measures.
	   JLB is confident that with a relatively low gearing, balanced
landbank in strategic locations and active involvement in the
manufacturing of essential building materials, it will maintain its
position as one of the leading property developers in the country
while maximising returns to shareholders.
	   A final dividend of 5 per cent gross has been recommended by the
board of directors.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - Human Resources Minister Datuk Lim Ah Lek
today turned the tables on the Malaysian Trades Union Congress
secretary-general G. Rajasekaran, answering all eight allegations
made by the unionist against him over ministry matters last week.
	   After providing reporters with detailed answers and providing
clarifications for two hours, Lim said Rajasekaran was ``doing
injustice to responsible unionists in the country''.
	   ``I am neither a liar nor a traitor to my country,'' Lim said
before chairing his ministry's post-Cabinet meeting.
	   At a Press conference last week, Rajasekaran said Lim was lying
when he accused the unionist of spreading lies about the country
while abroad.
	   ``After checking with my officers, we have found that all the
eight allegations made by Rajasekaran were unfounded.
	   ``I have nothing against him and the Government has nothing
against unionists who raise issues overseas. But what we cannot
tolerate is unionists spreading false news about the country
overseas,'' he said.
	   Replying to an issue raised by Rajasekaran last week that 69
former workers of Carnaud Metal Box Packaging Sdn Bhd did not get
higher retrenchment benefits despite taking the issue to Lim, the
Minister said: ``Rajasekaran had twisted the issue.
	   ``The workers did not come to see me to help them get higher
benefits, but they were baffled as to why their in-house union
secretary-general Jacob Engkatesoo was paid RM425,000 in ex-gratia
payment by the company in addition to the RM75,884.49 in
retrenchment benefits.''
	   Lim said he could not intervene as the workers and the
management had signed an agreement earlier.
	   ``How can I do that when the workers and the management had
agreed that each worker will be given one-month salary for every
year of service under the package. I will only be creating
industrial disharmony,'' he said.
	   Both Rajasekaran, who was also executive secretary of the union
and Engkatesoo were negotiating the voluntary retrenchment package
with the management then.
	   ``As top union officials, both had put aside the interests of
the affected workers. When I asked the company management to
explain why they paid the RM425,000, they could not give me an
answer.''
	   Lim said he then referred the workers' protests to the
Industrial Court and following this, they were given an additional
RM1.4 million in compensation.
	   ``The ministry intervened and got an additional RM1.4 million
for the workers. But why did the management pay Engkatesoo
RM425,000. Rajasekaran should have known about this as he was
negotiating with the management together with him,'' he said.
	   Among the other issues answered by Lim were: Rajasekaran had
claimed that the Minister had failed to intervene and direct Terry
Prai Sdn Bhd, a company in the Prai Free Trade Zone, to accord
recognition to the Penang Textile Workers Union. He said the
company only recognised an in-house union with the production
manager as president and personnel officer as the secretary.
	   Lim said there were no records at the Trades Union Department to
show that applications were submitted to form the Terry Prai Sdn
Bhd Workers Union.
	   This means that the issue of executives holding positions in the
in- house union does not arise.
	   Rajasekaran said the Kian Joo Can Factory had refused to
recognise the national union but instead recognised the in-house
union only months before it was registered.
	   Lim said checks by the Trades Union Department showed the
employees there were not interested to become union members.
	   He said however, an in-house union was established on Jan 5,
1985. The Trades Union Department approved the registration of the
in-house union on June 12, 1985 and the management recognised the
decision on June 18 the same year.
	   Lim said therefore claims by Rajasekaran that the in-house union
was recognised a few months before it was registered was unfounded.
	   On U Hoe Industries Snd Bhd's refusal to recognise Metal
Industry Employees Union but recognised an in-house union with whom
the company had signed a collective agreement, the in-house union
was actually a Sports Club where the company recruitment officer
was the club chairman.
	   Lim said the Trades Union Department had not received any
applications to register an in house union in the company.
	   What existed, he said, was the U Hoe Employee's Association
which was in no position to sign collective agreements.
	   Lim said as there was no in house union, the question of the
signing of collective agreement between the company in house union
and the management did not arise.
	   Again, Rajasekaran's claims were dismissed.

	   Scientific studies say that red wine prevents heart disease.
Recent findings reveal that drinking two to three glasses of it a
day may now reduce death rates from all causes by as much as 30%.
Andresons Group Inc., local distributors of E. and J. Gallo Wines
in the Philippines, discloses yet another scientific study on the
benefits of drinking red wine as part of its public affairs
program.
	   A French cardiologist who works with the prestigious INSERM
units at the University of Bordeaux, Serge Renaud, published the
latest finding on the health benefit of drinking red wine in the
Epidemiology journal. In the article, Dr. Renaud reported that
``wine protects not only against heart disease but also most
cancers.'' The report further states that a 30% reduction in death
rates from all causes is possible by drinking two to three glasses
of wine a day, including another 35% reduction from cardiovascular
disease and an 18%-24% reduction from having cancer.
	   Renaud's study of 34,000 middle-aged men living in eastern
France supports what is widely known as the ``French Paradox.'' The
French people, despite a regular diet of fat-saturated foods, still
live a lengthy life. This, according to many researchers, is
attributed to the French's propensity for drinking red wine.
	   In Renaud's study, a polyphenol compound found in grapes used in
wine-making is identified as the antioxidant responsible for
preventing cancer. ``Wine is a more diluted form of alcohol which
is important to the body. If taken moderately at mealtimes, the
body easily absorbs it,'' Renaud explains.
	   Renaud's latest scientific finding, which the Andresons Group
Inc. also published, further substantiates similar studies done on
the benefits of drinking red wine. One is the breakthrough
discovery of Dr. Terrence Leighton, Ph.D., from the University of
California, of the substance called quercetin, which is also proven
to be effective in the prevention of cancer.
	   According to Dr. Leighton's study, quercetin is normally bound
to sugar and it is neither mutagenic nor anti-carcinogenic. It
begins to act only as anti-carcinogenic when its bond to sugar is
broken, such as in the fermentation of grape juice to wine or
during the digestive process. In the digestive process, when
quercetin -- in rich red wine -- is consumed, bacteria in the colon
metabolizes the sugar, freeing the quercetin. The quercetin is now
free to repair DNA that has been damaged by carcinogens.
	   Quercetin's greatest value, however, lies in its ability to
block cancer's subsequent growth.
	   Previous to this is the research done by Dr. Morten Gronbaek on
red wine and heart disease. In his finding, Gronbaek revealed that
drinking three to five glasses of red wine daily can prevent the
risk of acquiring heart disease. According to Gronbaek, this is
made possible by the presence of natural substances called
flavonoids found in grapes that are abundantly present in red wine.
	   Dr. Gronbaek noted the increase in red wine consumption in
Denmark after the opening of the European market and the decline in
heart disease-related death in the last 15 years. He found that
there was a noted 30% decline in heart-related problems after
studying 13,285 men and women aged 30-79, for 12 years. Thus, the
correlation between the decline in heart disease and the increase
in red wine drinking was established.
	   With all the benefit of drinking red wine, the public must now
also be guided on how to choose the best wine. The best wines are
those which use only the grapes of the finest variety and undergo a
process that preserves its natural substances. E. and J. Gallo
ensures that natural important chemicals and substances are
preserved by directly crushing the grapes harvested from the
picking site and by employing the finest viticultural practices and
the latest technology in wine-making. E. and J. Gallo also ensures
the quality of their harvested grapes by providing the right amount
of moisture, temperature, and the best environment from which the
grapes will grow. Thus, natural chemicals and substances
responsible for preventing heart disease and possibly cancer are
preserved.
	   In the Philippines, latest statistics of the Department of
Health (DOH) show that heart disease and diseases of this nature
are the number one cause of death among Filipinos. Out of a
population of 100,000 at least 45,275 or 14.5% of total deaths have
resulted from heart-related diseases.
	   High risks in heart diseases are ascribed not only to fat-rich
diets, but also to industrialization and technological advancement
which adversely affect an individual's lifestyle.
	   The Europeans and Americans have long realized the benefits of
drinking red wine and have taken advantage of the many preventive
effects of the ``wonder liquor.'' Now, similar practice on the
health benefits of red wine have swept Asian countries like China
and Thailand. With Philippines on the threshold of tigerhood and
pitching its manpower in the global arena as one of its many
advantages, maybe a little practice of red wine drinking may just
help us get there? Cheers to long life then!

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - Four State DAP committees said today the
two suspended officials and another who was removed from his party
post should be allowed to present their case and given a fair
hearing.
	   Selangor DAP chairman Chua Kow Eng said the party leadership
should stop hurling accusations against the three - national
vice-chairman Liew Ah Kim, treasurer Fung Ket Wing and Wee Choo
Keong who was removed as publicity secretary.
	   Chua said the three should instead be given a ``fair hearing''
and allowed to defend themselves.
	   On June 3, the CEC decided on the action against the three for
criticising the party leadership.
	   DAP secretary-general Lim Kit Siang had said last week that
Liew, Fung and Wee had undermined party morale, created confusion
and caused disharmony as well as disunity.
	   ``In my personal view this matter is becoming very unpleasant.
Kit Siang and CEC are practically forcing us to listen to their
explanation,'' Chua said.
	   In Kota Kinabalu, Sabah DAP vice-chairman Oswald Mojingol said
Kit Siang should clarify what were the actual charges levelled at
the three as there were many conflicting reports.
	   Mojingol said one of the reasons given by Kit Siang was that the
three had undermined party morale, created confusion and caused
disharmony and disunity by criticising the party leadership.
	   He said it would be ``highly improper'' if the disciplinary
action was taken based on this as the DAP had always campaigned for
freedom of speech, transparency, fairness and equality.
	   However, he said he would support the CEC if the action was
taken against the three because of loss of confidence.
	   He said the CEC should seriously consider the trio's request for
an independent and impartial committee to investigate their case in
the interest of fairness, justice, equality, freedom and good
governance.
	   In Kuching, State DAP chairman Jason Wong Sing Nang said Liew,
Fung and Wee should be given a chance to present their case to the
members.
	   ``Although we respect the decision of the CEC which is always
based on a majority decision, I think it is only fair that the trio
be given a chance to explain themselves.
	   ``This is the best way to solve the present problems,'' said
Wong when contacted by telephone.
	   In Johor Baru, State DAP chairman S.K. Song said the committee
supported the call for an independent and impartial committee to
investigate the charges against the three and that the central
executive committee members should not be allowed in sit in the
committee.
	   He said principal officers from 74 branches and Johor committee
members would meet in Kluang to clear any issues related to the
suspension and removal of the three officials.
	   Song, who is also a CEC member, acknowledged that the three did
in fact pose a disciplinary problem to the committee (CEC) and
therefore, should be checked.
	   In Ipoh, State DAP chairman Ngeh Koo Ham said there was no
necessity for the three to state their case.
	   He said the matter was an internal affair of the party and must
be allowed to go through the ``normal process'' instead of blowing
it out of proportion.
	   ``I am not taking sides but the disciplinary committee which is
conducting an inquiry (into the matter) is the right body to make a
fair decision,'' he added.
	   In Seremban, State DAP chairman Wong Zee Nyok said members in
the State would adhere strictly to any CEC decision.
	   ``We have good faith in the CEC and are confident that any
decision made by it would be in the best interest of the party.''
	   He said that members in the State were confident that any action
by the CEC would be in accordance with the party's constitution.

	   METACORP Bhd expects to perform better for the financial year
ending December 31 1998 in anticipation of increased contribution
from its overseas investment and continuous cost improvements.
	   In his annual statement, Metacorp chairman Datuk Dr Mohamed
Ishak Mohamed Ariff says its property sector in London is
performing well for the residential and office phases.
	   The company's investments in Spitalfields Holdings Ltd and
Spitalfields Development Group are expected to significantly boost
the property division's performance for 1998.
	   Metacorp posted a group pre-tax of RM53.79 million for the
financial year ended December 31 1997, up 34 per cent from RM40.17
million previously.
	   Turnover rose 64 per cent to RM125.51 million from RM40.17
million in 1996, while profit after tax increased 22 per cent to
RM46.31 million for the year under review.
	   The improved performance was attributed mainly to higher sales
contribution from Phase 1 of Taman Tasik Utama in Ayer Keroh,
Malacca, an RM800 million development.
	   New phases of Taman Tasik Utama will be carefully planned with
market demand determining future launches, Mohamed Ishak says.
	   The group will also give priority to affordable homes and social
housing.
	   Meanwhile, the company's tolling operation performed better in
1997 compared to 1996. Metramac intends to further improve
profitability through better cost measures and higher efficiency.
	   The group intends to secure other infrastructural projects
within the Klang Valley for the current year.
	   A first and final dividend of 6.5 sen per share less tax has
been recommended.

	   WHAT will the new millennium hold for Asia and the developing
nations within it struggling to pick up the pieces of their
economy?
	   Will a borderless world benefit Asia and poorer countries, given
that muscle-flexing by the big boys is the order of the day in
times of currency and financial distress?
	   Not much and no. And the picture isn't pretty.
	   Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said this and much
more when he was in Tokyo for a four-day working visit last week
during which he addressed two major international gatherings - the
symposium on ``Revitalisation of the Japanese Economy and the
Future of Asia'' by the Institute for International Monetary
Affairs'' and the conference on ``The Future of Asia'' hosted by
Nihon Keizei Shimbun Inc (Nikkei).
	   So much had happened in so short a time in the region following
the collapse of the baht in July last year which led to the fall of
regional currencies.
	   For Malaysia, just two weeks before that, the bouquets were
still coming in.
	   Malaysia, according to International Monetary Fund managing
director Michel Camdessus was a good example of a country, ``where
the authorities are well aware of the challenges of managing the
pressures that result from high growth and of maintaining a sound
financial system amid substantial capital flows and a booming
property market''.
	   Malaysia was given a clean bill of health and the IMF praised
the country's economic fundamentals.
	   We were part of that ``East Asian Miracle'', a characterisation,
the Prime Minister hastened to add, ``invented by the
impressionable West''.
	   Malaysia, according to the annual World Competitiveness
Yearbook, issued by the prestigious International Institute for
Management Development was the second most competitive economy in
the world, after the United States.
	   Singapore was third and Luxembourg, fourth. We were to say the
least, in company of the best.
	   ``Many foreigners, including the most tough, hard-nosed
personalities and organisations, told us the most flattering
things, which strengthened us in our conviction that our
fundamentals were very strong indeed,'' said Dr Mahathir.
	   In fact, most of the other economies so severely hit since the
IMD issued its 1997 report also scored highly based on fundamental
factors.
	   The Asian crash of 1997 was unprecedented just as the economic
growth of these countries had been.
	   So, Dr Mahathir, surprised no one when in his style and element,
gave his views of the future of Asia in a globalised world that
only benefit the powerful and leave Asian nations struggling to
survive and compete with the big boys.
	   No time and place for rhetorics there as the Prime Minister made
his message clear and hard that as long as there is disparity in
the world's economic order, and as long as currency traders are
allowed to continue with their practice unabated and unchecked,
there is very little to hope for in Asia's future.
	   How could a region be made poor and helpless by powers and
forces beyond its control, leaving the countries within with little
choice but to be at the mercy of those who are in position to help?
	   So unrelenting and unwavering was he on the practices of these
forces (read: currency traders and new capitalists) that he said
the time had come for a global reform of the international
financial system for these volatile fluctuations in the currency
market to be, somehow, checked.
	   But, Dr Mahathir conceded that it would be difficult, given the
fact that these are new capitalists operating in rich and powerful
countries, who will have everything to lose with reform and
everything to gain without.
	   ``But, one day they will lose money and they will realise,'' he
told Malaysian journalists at the end of his visit last week.
	   After all didn't the world take 70 years to realise how bad
communism was?
	   Certainly it will be a long hard, and possibly lonely, road for
him in his war against currency traders to make the world realise
that these ``unabashed'' practices should cease and desist, that
they cannot regulate themselves, so their Governments must do so
and impose restrictions on their practices.
	   It is unacceptable that these traders can render a currency of a
country unstable by their play with the market. A prosperous
country, nay, a region, can be so easily made poor in so brief a
time.
	   When he blamed currency traders soon after the ringgit
depreciated at the start of the currency instability in the region,
many hesitated to subscribe to his view.
	   Some dismissed it as paranoia. Some said he was not being
realistic, that really, he was avoiding the reality that we simply
did not manage our economy well.
	   In time, many realised that he was not far from the truth.
Nevertheless, by any measure, calling for some kind of reform does
seem radical simply because it is not easy to do.
	   But the world has two options - decide to end these practices
that have proven to be destructive to entire region by massive
devaluation of currencies or leave them alone to rule the world.
	   As an example of violent currency fluctuation, Dr Mahathir cited
one currency - the rupiah - which at one time was devalued by more
than 600 per cent, then in a space of a few days recovered by 200
per cent. It is so easy to blame Governments for economic
mismanagement as it is to blame currency speculators for the
financial instability in the region.
	   How easy it is then to assume that currencies are intelligent
and can devalue themselves when the Governments which issue them
misbehave.
	   So, Asian nations must take stock of themselves and correct
weaknesses, work together to be strong because in a globalised
world, they will prosper for as long as they can resist forces that
could render nations helpless and needy.

	   YEO Hiap Seng (M) Bhd (YHS) plans to absorb any price increases
in its products brought about by the rising cost of imported raw
materials such as soyabean, lychee concentrate and milk powder.
	   ``The depreciation of the ringgit has left an impact on the
import price of raw materials and packaging,'' chairman Datuk
Borhan Kuntom said after the company's annual general meeting.
	   He said product cost has increased by 50 per cent, hence
increasing the price of their products in the local market.
	   According to YHS finance director Chew Eng Chai, the passing of
adjustments in prices will depend on both the type of product and
YHS' efficiency.
	   Meanwhile, YHS hopes to maintain its performance for the current
financial year.
	   ``We will try to maintain our present position in the market.
Despite the increase in turnover, our bottomline has not improved
enough,'' Borhan said.
	   For the financial year ended December 31 1997, the group
recorded a pre- tax profit of RM30.15 million on turnover of
RM493.25 million.
	   YHS is also taking steps to use more local content in their
products and expand its export market to China.
	   At present, YHS exports to Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and
Europe.
	   The exports contribute between 5 and 10 per cent to the
company's profits.
	   The company will also take measures to revamp its marketing
strategies and optimise employee skills, in addition to using new
technology and equipment to increase its turnover.
	   Last year, YHS recorded an increase of between 5 and 6 per cent
in the sales of its non-carbonated drinks.
	   It hopes to maintain this figure for the current financial year.
	   In 1997, the local market for non-carbonated and carbonated
drinks were 149 million litres and 288 million litres respectively.
	   YHS has a 60 per cent share of the non-carbonated drink market.

	   Reality Check
	   With only a few hours until the big celebration, there is little
time left to meditate on the significance of being 100 years old.
Had it been a person whose centennial we were about to celebrate,
the fragile frame would imply a countdown to terminal expiration.
And by the way some people are reacting to the festivity, one can
hardly tell the difference.
	   To muse is to think deep, so to be ``a-mused'' means not to
think at all.
	   Starting this very minute, congratulatory notes should pour in
from world leaders, blending with that one grandiose outburst from
atop four barges in the form of a salvo of fireworks. After
spending billions to recreate history, the question remains whether
the nation has grown an inch taller or not.
	   While amused by the extravagance of a single day, the writings
of not only a few cynics showed that they, too, are deep thinkers.
But some of them cannot reconcile the conveyance of sovereignty
with the commencement of nationhood. Another group views imperfect
sovereignty as constituting no sovereignty at all. Perhaps both
arguments have merits. Is there a convergence? Or do such musings
belong to another dimension and era?
	   The struggle against foreign dominion started long before
Lapu-Lapu became a fish. Centuries prior to that, external
aggressions could have come from across a river or ocean, or a
mountain. In all civilizations, life was a constant battle for
survival. In the old book, Abel did not do too well with Cain
around, Esau was no match for Jacob, while Isaac and Ishmael
inadvertently sponsored a seemingly everlasting holy war.
	   Our archipelago was not spared of its own holy war either.
Owners of a new religion could not subdue the populace completely,
leaving the matter for the people to resolve among themselves. Over
half a millenium, three waves of invasions cut a swath across the
islands, muddling the issue of exactly when the nation was actually
born. Perhaps it is to the credit of the Spaniards that the people
were united into one. But maybe the swords of the Japanese drew
them closer.It could also have been because of the Americans and
their legalistic commercialism that we really decided to go it
together, sort of. This very day after 50 odd years of political
adventurism, we stand at the portal of a new century, to face
self-determination within a new global environment sewn together by
fiber-optical strands.
	   There was a time when an egalitarian ideology held sway over a
large group of our people which thought it to be the final solution
to all problems.
	   Blood was shed to prove the argument, all aided by many years of
institutionalized megalomania. Even after the ideology had been
sent to the dustbin of history, remnants still hold out hope that
the machines that we have built to render their arguments
meaningless will implode. They forget that such event could lead to
the annihilation of mankind, leaving nothing to debate about. Hence
it is important for them to reintegrate into the mainstream by
subscribing to the old truth that a house divided cannot stand.
	   The problem of religion -- in our southern parts -- is more
intractable.
	   Faith is an issue that transcends political and economic
governance.
	   Recently, the shell of solidified enmity was cracked to allow
diagnosis or maybe healing to take place. Rallying behind the
centennial flag and a new leadership may perhaps expedite the
processes, and coagulate all elements into a reinvigorated entity
called the Filipino nation.
	   Do not worry, time has always been on our side.
	   But first, Filipinos must be willing to be united. Whether due
to philosophical differences or segmental interests, our people are
as divided as during the Spanish era.
	   Japanese spies spotted this weakness when preparing for their
eventual invasion. Using the same principle, the Americans dangled
gold and power in front of a few, without having to bother about
conquering. Dividing did the job all by itself.
	   On this meditative eve, it must be stated that unity is a
personal matter and not generic. It starts with the self, and not
the next person. Each person must stand alone before the altar of
nationhood to examine his past and identify his future as part of
the larger picture. Some say sacrifices are like cut stems of roses
who wither and die after a few hours of elegant display. They point
to selfish monopolies and licentious profiteers protected by
high-falluting legalism and political power. It is simple to say
that the blood of martyrs was not offered in vain, but the ensuing
chain of predatory leadership was difficult to swallow. So where
can the little people go? Are they modern-day sacrificial lambs?
Where are the judges? Where are retribution and redress? What
freedom are we talking about?
	   When the era of the biblical judges drew to a close, the people
cried for a leader and God gave them King Saul and then King David.
Several generations earlier, Joseph the Dreamer was tapped by God
to save His people from devastating poverty as the earth refused to
produce.
	   Has a dreaming Joseph emerged for us? The query is whether God
is with him or not. In Biblical times, judgment would come as
people rebelled against their leaders, or whenever leaders rebelled
against God. Priests were go-betweens between the people and God.
In the cacophony of modern beliefs and disbeliefs, one wonders if
Biblical principles are still important and applicable. Perhaps the
church could examine itself and pray harder. And the people must
ask themselves if they are willing to stand behind their leaders
and stop criticizing them. Do we have too many critics and lawyers?
Can we not be our brothers' keepers? Or forgive those in other
lands who violated us? Are mercy, love, and unity not the
precedents of peace and prosperity?
	   Are we hardened like the Egyptians were during the time of
Moses? Why already write history when it is still being created?
Why let seething anger devour us?
	   In the meantime, be reminded that without a yesterday there
cannot be a tomorrow. The colorful history of the Filipino people
gives full testimony of glory attained after harsh birth pains.
Filipinos have never transgressed on the territory of any other
people, not even on invaders pretending to be visitors. The century
of abuse is over and there is no use moping over it. The world is
no longer our enemy. So let the celebration begin! Happy
independence centennial to all and you!

	   MALAYSIA Building Society Bhd (MBSB) says it is poised to take
on challenges and business opportunities in the current economic
slowdown by giving priority to loan collection and supervision.
	   In his annual statement, chairman Tan Sri Dr Sallehuddin Mohamed
says MBSB's performance for 1998 will be influenced largely by
Malaysia's economic recovery and its corresponding effects on the
property market.
	   He says despite the mounting economic problems, demand for
conventional housing is expected to be favourable but with less
interest in other sub- sectors, especially with the surplus in the
high-end condominium, retail and office sectors.
	   MBSB is a subsidiary of the Employees Provident Fund Board,
which holds a 60.01 per cent stake.
	   Sallehuddin adds that although the Government has put in place
steps required for quick recovery, sentiment in the property sector
is expected to be subdued if the uncertainty with regards to the
regional economic scenario extends beyond 1998.
	   On the 35.93 per cent drop in pre-tax profit for the year ended
December 31 1997 to RM49.36 million from RM77.04 million the
previous year, he attributes it to the special provision of RM20
million for non-performing loans (NPLs).
	   He says the company's board adopted a change in the accounting
treatment relating to the classification of NPLs, whereby
recognition of interest as income is suspended when loans are in
arrears for three months or more.
	   MBSB recorded group pre-tax profit of RM45.68 million against
RM74.43 million in 1996.
	   The directors have declared a final dividend of 5 sen in
addition to the 9 sen interim dividend for the financial year.
	   During the year, it undertook an exercise to increase its share
capital from RM350 million to RM500 million by creating an
additional 150 million ordinary shares of RM1 each.
	   The enlarged paid-up capital now stands at RM337.86 million
compared with RM121.63 million in 1996.
	   Sallehuddin says the enlarged capital base will allow MBSB to
expand its operations and take advantage of business opprtunities.
	   He adds that MBSB mortgage loans receivable recorded a new high
of RM4.364 billion as at December 31 1997, up 44.32 per cent from
RM3.024 billion in 1996.
	   In addition to providing housing loans, it extends financing
packages comprising bridging, term, revolving, factoring and
end-finance facilities for the residential development of Taman
Bukit Gambier in Penang, Bandar Sepang Utama in Selangor, Bandar
Baru Lukut in Negri Sembilan and Taman Pulai Utama in Johor.
	   Sallehuddin also says that the EPF and MBSB have become partners
in a mixed property development project in Sungei Besi, Kuala
Lumpur, emphasising low, low-medium and medium-cost residential
units.

	   How to bring the Centennial of 1998 alive in your own home? The
Purefoods Consumer Services Group suggests a themed-at-home event
to make the Centennial more vivid and meaningful to your family.
	   What easier way to celebrate the Centennial than with a buffet
of traditional Filipino dishes, such as pochero, chicken galantina,
sinigang, pakbet, adobo, ginataang alimango, and tinola. These are
just some of the dishes our heroes loved, and you can discuss a bit
of the heroes' lives as you bring out the dishes. (Today, you can
create these menus without the fuss, with the advent of convenience
food. Chorizo Bilbao, ham, noodles, even meats such as beef tapa,
pork tocino, and longanisa - Purefoods now makes them fast and
fresh).
	   Culinary trivia to share: Jose Rizal loved sinigang mongo and
tinola.
	   Marcelo H. del Pilar fancied pochero with atcharang talong. Pio
del Pilar craved sinigang na bangus sa bayabas, and Gen. Emilio
Aguinaldo, asparagus soup. Try serving samples of these dishes -
you can either follow generations-old recipes or concoct updated
versions altogether. Here's a chicken with asparagus recipe you
might want to try, and thrill guests, especially kids, no end
knowing that they are actually eating the favorite veggie of the
valiant general: Rub whole fresh chicken with 1 1/2 tbsps salt. Put
a bundle of lemongrass (tanglad), sliced ginger, and two bayleaves
into the cavity of the chicken.
	   Steam for approximately 40 minutes. Add a bundle of fresh
asparagus to the broiling broth and cook for one to two minutes.
Serve with patis and lime juice on the side.
	   Another Centennial recipe you can serve is tamales, a classic
favorite for merienda (midday snack): Combine 2 cups of toasted
Purefoods Baron all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup peanut butter, 1/4 cup
brown sugar, 3 cups coconut milk, 1 tsp pepper, 1 tsp cayenne
pepper, 1 tsp paprika, and a dash of salt.
	   Simmer until thick. Transfer half of the mixture to another pan
and set aside. Add 2 tbsps atsuete oil to the remaining half to
make a yellow mixture. Continue cooking until the dough paste is
separated from the side of the pan. Cool. Arrange two strips of
banana leaves crosswise. Spoon 1 tbsp of the white mixture and top
with the yellow mixture. Arrange Purefoods Tender Juicy Hotdog
strips and salted egg slices on top. Form a square and wrap with
banana leaves. Wrap with aluminum foil and steam for 30 minutes.
Cool before unwrapping and serve.
	   Serve your dishes in traditional palayok with matching sandok as
serving spoon. Aside from the palayok, pepper the buffet table with
flaglets. Or, exercise your creative streak - arrange assorted
colored beans to form a flag and make your centerpiece decor on the
table. Set the table with banana leaf-lined plates and sinamay
tablecloth.
	   A program of piano, song, and poetry-reading are traditional
features of the Filipino party. Have your children memorize and
recite historical works such as Rizal's ``Ultimo Adios,'' Jacinto's
``Dekalogo'', or Bonifacio's ``Pag-ibig sa Sariling Bayan.'' This
sets the stage for your at-home celebration and makes history more
meaningful.
	   Suggest that the guests play sungka. (A banig-covered floor
would be perfect for the activity.) The kids can have fun playing
piko or tumbang preso outdoors.
	   Stage a silhouette (shadow) theater presentation just as Jose
Rizal used to do. Using a thin, white sheet as a screen, set up
lights behind the blanket so only shadows are seen from the other
side. You can either use puppets, paper cut-outs, or even act out
stories yourselves. This should be really fun for kids, and adults
will love the impromptu scripts.
	   Dress up in ``katipunero'' costumes, with just camisa chinos and
a pair of pants rolled up till mid-calf. Ladies, though, need not
wear a whole baro't saya ensemble - a simple tubao, worn in
different fashionable possibilities like a scarf, will make a great
period costume as well.
	   After everything's done and over with, send out a souvenir photo
of the good times at the party - in black and white or sepia print!
It may cost a little more than the usual photo developing charges,
but hey, the Centennial comes but once in a lifetime.
	   (For more information, write to PO Box 475 GPO 1502, San Juan,
Metro Manila. Or call the Purefoods Consumer Hotline at 914-1111.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yugoslav reaction to NATO decision, White House
comment. &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO decided Thursday to use military
preparations, including simulated air strikes, to send a strong
message to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that he should
cease his crackdown on separatist Kosovo.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and his 15 NATO colleagues
approved a package of measures they hoped would persuade Milosevic
to pull back his Serb-led army and police forces in the province,
where they have been carrying out escalating attacks on the
ethnic-Albanian majority.
	   ``President Milosevic would be rash and foolish if he would
ignore the message coming from NATO,'' said British Defense
Secretary George Robertson. ``The message is clear and unambiguous
_ Belgrade, think again.''
	   More than 250 people have died in clashes between government
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of the
Albanian independence movement. Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent
of the province's population.
	   Under the measures, NATO will conduct simulated air attacks in
Albania and Macedonia, probably sometime next week. Those nations
border Kosovo and support the NATO action, especially Albania,
which has seen at least 12,000 Kosovo refugees flood across its
border in the last two weeks.
	   NATO will also study options for further action _ ranging from
accelerated planning for military exercises in the region to direct
air strikes inside Yugoslavia to using air mobile ground troops.
	   This is aimed at persuading Milosevic to declare a cease-fire in
the province, withdraw his forces and open serious negotiations
with the opposition.
	   ``We will be holding exercises in the region, including
immediately an air exercise which will demonstrate NATO's
capability to rapidly project power into the region,'' NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said: ``We cannot afford
any longer to focus on hollow solutions of rather symbolic
character like border security missions in Albania or Macedonia.''
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said
Thursday's decision, along with a meeting of the American and
European foreign ministers on Friday in London, reflected the
growing international pressure on Milosevic.
	   ``That diplomatic pressure, now backed with this military
presence in the region, should send the signal to Milosevic that
it's time for him to cease and desist,'' McCurry said.
	   No one, however, was able to give any assurances that a mere
demonstration of NATO power would stop a Balkan leader apparently
bent on ruthlessly putting down a rebellion in his own country.
	   ``I don't think anyone can predict what will impress or persuade
Mr. Milosevic,'' said Cohen, adding that a demonstration of
firepower would have ``some educational value.''
	   ``We believe very strongly that it will send a signal that there
is not only solidarity of opinion but also the ability to rapidly
deploy forces that could engage in a significant activity in a
short period of time,'' he said.
	   In Belgrade, Yugoslavia warned it would not tolerate any NATO
actions on its territory.
	   ``We are a sovereign country and, without our consent, no
actions of any international alliance can be carried out on our
territory _ especially since there is no reason for it,'' Ivica
Dacic, spokesman for Milosevic's ruling Socialists, told the
independent FoNet news agency.
	   A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the exercises will be carried out in the next few
days and could include simulated bombing raids by NATO planes and
rocket attacks by helicopters. Details were still being worked out.
	   The United States and its allies support autonomy for Kosovo but
oppose demands for independence. They face the dilemma of showing
force to the Serbs without showing favor to the rebel forces.
	   The political objective of the military action, NATO said in its
declaration, is to ``support a political solution which brings an
end to the violence, provides an enhanced status for Kosovo,
preserves the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, and safeguards the human and civil rights of all the
inhabitants of Kosovo, whatever their ethnic origin.''

	   PETALING JAYA, Wed. - The three DAP officials who were suspended
and removed from their national posts lodged a complaint today with
the party's disciplinary committee against secretary-general Lim
Kit Siang for making baseless allegations against them.
	   The three - suspended national vice-chairman Liew Ah Kim and
treasurer Fung Ket Wing and sacked national publicity secretary Wee
Choo Keong - handed a letter to the committee urging it to
investigate Lim's conduct.
	   They said Lim's allegations that their statements had undermined
party morale, created confusion and caused disharmony as well as
disunity in the party were made without any investigation.
	   At a Press conference, Wee, speaking on behalf of the three,
said Lim was now going on a roadshow to garner support from members
over the central executive committee's June 3 decision to suspend
and remove them.
	   ``This is unfair as it could influence the hearing of our case
by the disciplinary committee.
	   If this is allowed to continue, the decision by the committee
will be a foregone conclusion and we will certainly be found guilty
as charged.''
	   On the hearing which has been set for June 17, Wee said they had
not been officially contacted by the committee, headed by
vice-chairman Ahmad Nor.
	   ``We only know about it from Press reports. Moreover, it is
difficult for us to prepare our case as the composition of the
committee is still being questioned.''
	   They reiterated that Teng Chang Kim and Ronnie Liu, who are CEC
members, should discharge themselves from the case as the two had
voted in favour in the CEC's decision to suspend two of them and
remove the other.
	   Wee said they were also asking for the three-member disciplinary
committee be be enlarged to five to ensure impartiality.
	   He said they had nothing personal against Lim and denied that
they were behind attempts to topple the party's leadership as
alleged by Lim.

	   MALAYSIA has called for the International Labour Organisation
(ILO) to get the the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to consider the social
consequences on workers arising from the remedies that the two
institutions prescribed on troubled countries.
	   ``Failure on the part of the ILO to respond meaningfully might
render the Organisation irrelevant in the eyes of the workers in
those countries and elsewhere,'' Deputy Human Resources Minister
Datuk Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir said at the 86th session of the
International Labour Conference in Geneva on Tuesday.
	   The text of his speech was released in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   Abdul Kadir called on the ILO to adopt a pro-active stance to
help the affected countries implement steps to overcome the
challenges currently facing them.
	   He said technical assistance on innovative employment-creation
measures might also be considered.
	   ``Most importantly, ILO should impress upon the main creatures
of Bretton Woods - the IMF and the World Bank, that whatever
remedies that they might prescribe on these countries, the social
consequences on workers should be judiciously taken into
consideration,'' he said.
	   Abdul Kadir said the 12th Asian Regional Meeeting held in
Bangkok last December 9 to 11 had called for a strong ILO response
to minimise the adverse effects of the financial crisis that
affecting the East Asian region.
	   ``The meeting emphasised that immediate steps to be taken,
including on training and redeployment of displaced workers, as
among the ways to manage the crisis,'' he said.
	   He said Malaysia lauds the ILO's efforts and contributions
towards improving the workers' welfare.
	   He said the initiative taken by the ILO director-general to
augment ILO's promotion of labour standards by means of a
Declaration, which places its focus on the core conventions, is a
positive move.
	   Abdul Kadir expressed the Malaysian view that general consensus
of all members is needed for such instrument to be effective.
	   ``The instrument should in no way impose new obligations nor
should it depart at all from the principle of voluntarism.
	   ``Importantly, it should explicitly reject any linkage to
international trade, neither should the follow-up mechanisms
formulated permit the imposition of punitive measures for
non-compliance,'' he said.
	   He said the mechanism should also fully consider the prevailing
national conditions as well as the laws and regulations in practice
vis-a-vis the Conventions.
	   Rigidity in the application of these Conventions would only
serve to deter members' further ratification, he said.
	   ``A Convention which is universal in nature should merely set
the minimum standards to be followed by members,'' he added.
	   On child labour, Abdul Kadir said a new instrument targeting the
intolerable forms of child labour will certainly generate greater
awareness of the matter among members.
	   ``Hovewer, we view that social labelling is not the answer.
	   ``Rather, the promotional efforts under the International
Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour should be allowed to
continue and speeded up its momentum,'' he added.,

	   Members of the Federation of Petroleum Dealers Association of
the Philippines (FPDAP) are seeking greater flexibility in
adjusting the level of pump prices to bring about genuine
competition in the retail market.
	   The announcement was made June 9 after the Energy Regulatory
Board (ERB) made public its decision to raise the prices of three
regulated oil products by an average of P0.20 per liter.
	   Sources said the price increase, which had earlier been
scheduled on or before June 15, could take effect today.
	   Sources from the ERB said the increase was due to a $0.49
increase in the May average Dubai crude cost of $12.69 per barrel
from the $12.20 in April.
	   Members of the FPDAP said pricing benefits, however competitive,
would only favor bulk consumers over small consumers. Oil companies
at present continue to dictate the selling price of petroleum
products to the public via the suggested maximum ceiling for retail
prices.
	   FPDAP claimed that despite the full implementation of the new
oil deregulation law, dealers are expected to stick to the oil
firms' suggested retail prices.
	   Under the new oil deregulation law, oil companies have been
given the freedom to set the wholesale posted prices (WPP) of
petroleum products using the change in the crude landed cost method
which includes the cost of imported crude oil, ocean freight,
insurance, ocean loss, customs duties, customs fees and wharfage
fees.
	   However, while the pump prices are determined by the WPP,
dealers feel that retail prices should no longer be limited to what
oil refiners dictate as the suggested maximum selling price.
	   Dealers cited an unsteady local currency as a justification of
their push for more control over price setting.
	   ``Even if the cost of maintaining the station goes up, as it
regularly does, they still have to stick to what they tell us...
we're just as affected as any regular consumer,'' one dealer said.
	   ``If the peso continues to depreciate, it will eventually affect
our profit margin. Even now, we're already working on a slim
margin,'' he added.
	   The peso went to a high of P37.607 in April before gradually
slipping and eventually settling at P39.47 against the dollar
Tuesday.
	   Dealers said the flexibility to determine prices at their own
levels would help reflect not only the real cost of gas station
operations but price adjustments to benefit their service area
customers.
	   ``Actual retail prices can, however, be adjusted by P0.02 to
P0.05, but the very small margin of the gasoline operator will have
to be sacrificed,'' the FPDAP said.
	   FPDAP also cited the situation in the provinces where motorists
still go for the cheapest product, unlike in Manila where price
becomes secondary to convenience, customer service, or quality,
especially with the unpredictable traffic situation in the
metropolis.
	   FPDAP stressed that this was unlike the competition in the
industrial, manufacturing and power supply sectors wherein the oil
firms, as well as the new players, offer them a wide variety of
pricing and non-pricing choices.
	   Thus, bulk fuel supply decisions stem from the best pricing
offer, payment terms and technical support.
	   ``Unfortunately, dealers at the retail level who service the
smaller users are expected to tow the line,'' one Shell dealer
said.
	   He added that non-compliance may be used as ground for possible
sanctions or worst, could spell the non-renewal of the business
contract which normally lasts for five years.
	   The FPDAP groups 3,100 dealers from the three major oil
companies, Petron Corp., Caltex Phils. Inc., and Pilipinas Shell
Petroleum Corp.

	   PETALING JAYA, Wed. - DAP deputy secretary-general Lim Guan Eng
was taken to the district police headquarters here tonight for
questioning for speaking at an illegal assembly.
	   The political secretary to DAP secretary-general Lim Kit Siang,
Hew Kuan Yow, Selangor DAP committee member Wong Kok Yew and party
member Lee Pin Soo were also picked up for allegedly obstructing
police from carrying out their duties.
	   Guan Eng, who is Kota Melaka MP, was picked up for questioning
after he spoke to about 1,000 party members at a solidarity dinner
at the Yat Yeh Hing restaurant in Jalan SS4D/2 about 10.30pm.
	   The police picked him up after repeatedly warning him and Kit
Siang not to speak since the gathering was held without a permit.
	   Police also moved in members of the Federal Reserve Unit's Light
Strike Force to disperse the crowd after they failed to heed the
police warning.
	   Present at the dinner were DAP national chairman Dr Chen Man Hin
and leaders Dr Tan Seng Giaw, Ahmad Nor, Dr Oon Hong Geok, Tan Kok
Wai, Teng Chang Khim, Ronnie Liu and Teresa Kok.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - Hardly two weeks after his acquittal in an
Australian court in Brisbane, former Selangor Menteri Besar Tan Sri
Muhammad Muhammad Taib was today charged with failing to fully
declare his assets to the Anti-Corruption Agency last year.
	   Muhammad, 52, claimed trial and was granted a personal bond of
RM10,000 pending hearing on Dec 7.
	   He appeared calm when the case was first mentioned in the
Sessions Court and said ``Tidak bersalah'' (Not guilty) when the
interpreter asked for his plea after reading the charge.
	   Following the prosecution's application, Sessions Court judge
Mohamad K.
	   Abdul Rahman transferred the case to the High Court and fixed it
for mention at 2.30pm before judge Datuk Chin Fook Yen. Legal
observers said this was probably done to reflect the seriousness of
the case.
	   When court was adjourned, Muhammad was taken to the Sessions
Court registry to execute the bond.
	   About a dozen Press photographers followed him to the registry
and waited outside for about 20 minutes before they realised
Muhammad had left by another exit with his counsel Muhammad Shafee
Abdullah.
	   Muhammad was acquitted by the Brisbane District Court on May 29
on charges of falsely declaring the money he took into Australia on
Dec 16, 1996 and failing to declare more than A$1.2 million (RM2.95
million) when he left the country on Dec 22. The money, which was
seized by the Australian police following his arrest, was released
the day after his acquittal.
	   In the High Court later today, Muhammad claimed trial again
after the charge was read.
	   The charge stated that he had not complied with a notice dated
April 10, 1997 requiring him to declare every tangible and
non-tangible assets belonging to him, his agent or trustee, his
wife, sons and daughters.
	   It further stated that Muhammad had only mentioned in his
declaration dated May 23, 1997 assets worth RM10,815,232.24 and
A$3.46 million at the time of acquiring it (by his own estimate,
the properties were worth RM30,831,306.15 and A$1 million
respectively at the time of the declaration).
	   Muhammad, who resigned as Menteri Besar in April last year, had
allegedly committed the offence at the ACA office in Persiaran Duta
on May 26 last year.
	   He is charged under section 25(2) of the Anti-Corruption Act,
1961 which carries a maximum fine of RM2,000 or a year's jail or
both.
	   Senior Deputy Public Prosecutors Datuk Abdul Gani Patail and
Azahar Muhammad prosecuted.
	   Judge Chin dismissed the defence application for a list of the
assets which Muhammad had allegedly failed to declare.
	   ``The defendant had done a positive act and he is not charged
for that act, but for a negative act of ommission,'' he said,
agreeing with Abdul Gani that naming the assets would amount to
disclosing the prosecution's evidence.
	   Chin said if the undeclared properties did not belong to
Muhammad, ``that will be the end of the matter and there is nothing
for him to rebut.''
	   The judge made the ruling after hearing submissions by Muhammad
Shafee who had argued that the charge lacked material particulars
as it did not contain the assets and properties which Muhammad had
allegedly failed to declare.
	   Abdul Gani said the charge clearly stated that Muhammad had
failed to comply with the conditions of the notice requiring him to
declare every asset.
	   ``The prosecution is saying that the defendant had not declared
all his properties,'' he said.
	   Muhammad was accompanied by his wife Puan Sri Asbi Rohani Hasnan
and his brothers Datuk Othman, Datuk Raduan, Hassan and Hasbullah

	   Sir:
	   I am glad that Atty. Raoul Dizon, columnist of The Business
Daily, wrote about Dr. Luciano Talens, the UP Los Banos-based
scientist given by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST)
a ``Balik-Scientist Award'' to develop our own FMD Vaccine. I have
been fortunate to have met this brilliant scientist myself.
	   Dr. Talens' case is revealing and instructive to all those who
ask the question: ``Why is it that despite our talents, we cannot
seem to succeed as we should?'' It involves the same old story of
some of our government officials again, not knowing how to act as a
team. If they do not fight, they withdraw their cooperation from
one another, frustrating the good begun by the other departments.
	   This is clear in the case of Dr. Talens. For example,
considering that the foot-and-mouth (FMD) vaccine being developed
-- or rather already developed by Dr. Talens under the DOST
Balik-Scientist Award, is good for our livestock industry -- why
did not the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI), whose mandate is to
improve precisely that industry, try their best to help Dr. Talens
achieve his objective, instead of ``throwing the book'' at him?
	   Let us not talk about the millions of pesos that the DOST has
already sunk in this project. Let us just talk of our countrymen
being able to develop our own vaccines which our swine and cattle
farmers all over the country can buy at low cost and use to
effectively treat and prevent the FMD Disease.
	   The president should order an immediate investigation of this
incident to see if there is more to the insistence of the BAI that
Dr. Talens and his government laboratory did not adhere to legal
requirements. Let us find out if there are officials in the BAI, or
the Department of Agriculture itself, who have allowed themselves
to be used as puppets by external interests, who do not want us to
produce products that compete with theirs. Because if there are,
that will be treason.
	   Dr. Luciano Talens is lucky to have a counsel like Atty. Dizon
who is not only competent, but one who has a sincere heart for the
country. But it is not enough for our scientists to have champions
like him. They must organize, not just to ensure that they get
their due share from their scientific researchers, but more so to
push for the punishment of government officials whose improper, or
worse, abuse of authority makes the failure of our development
efforts a certainty.
	   President-elect Joseph Estrada has made it known that the
promotion of science and technology and the protection of our
scientists is an important part of his 10-point program of
government. Thus, he should also be very interested in the case of
Dr. Luciano Talens. Thank you.
	   (Sgd.) A.V. VALERIO President, Kilusan-TUCP Vice President, TUCP

	   BANK Islam Malaysia Berhad (BIMB) will introduce online
real-time banking services at all its 80 branches nationwide
towards the end of next year once it completes the first phase of
its Management Information System (MIS) Upgrade Programme.
	   The online branch banking initiative is part of the bank's
efforts to focus on providing more efficient transactions as well
as premier Islamic financial products and services.
	   According to BIMB's managing director Datuk Ahmad Tajudin Abdul
Rahman, the MIS Upgrade Programme seeks to undertake the
development and implementation of the bank's Total Islamic Banking
Solution (TIBS), which is said to be the first of its kind in the
Asian region.
	   ``Through TIBS, we aim to provide quality service to customers,
which is critical to our long-term plan of becoming a forerunner in
the local banking industry,'' Ahmad Tajudin said.
	   He was speaking at a Press conference after representing BIMB in
a signing ceremony with SAP Data Processing (M) Sdn Bhd (SAP
Malaysia) in Kuala Lumpur on Monday for the acquisition of the SAP
R/3 client-server business application.
	   At the event, SAP Malaysia was represented by SAP's Southwest
Asia executive vice president John DuBois who currently heads the
Malaysian operations. The signing was witnessed by BIMB's retail
banking general manager Mustafa Hamat and SAP's South Asia regional
basis (technical) manager Hannes Mikudim.
	   The purchase of the SAP R/3 client-server business application
costs RM2 million, and was part of the initial allocation of RM100
million for the MIS Upgrade Programme. To date, about 60 per cent
of the budget has been utilised.
	   The R/3 application, when implemented, will standardise and
centralise all accounting and financial processes. It will form
part of the backbone to the TIBS front-end delivery system and
includes modules such as financial, management accounting,
consolidation, executive information system (EIS), procurement,
capital project system (CPS) and human resources (HR) in Malaysian
payroll system.
	   Under the agreement, SAP Malaysia will also provide the
necessary training for BIMB staff and support for the product.
	   ``By embarking on SAP R/3, BIMB will be re-engineering its
financial management systems, and this will significantly enhance
our operating efficiency,'' said Ahmad Tajudin.
	   BIMB's TIBS, which was initiated in October last year, comprises
solutions for retail banking, financial, treasury, trade finance,
remittance, human resources (HR), electronic banking and executive
information system.
	   The first phase of implementation began in April and includes
the installation of the financial, management accounting and EIS
modules. It is expected to go live in September.
	   This will be followed by the installation of the consolidation,
procurement, CPS and HR modules and is targeted to go live in
February next year. In future, BIMB also plans to market TIBS to
other financial institutions, both local and foreign.
	   BIMB currently has 79 branches already operational and it is
scheduled to open its 80th towards the end of this month.

World Cup: Polster's late goal give Austria draw with Cameroon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Anton Polster scored off a corner kick
in second-half injury time to give Austria a 1-1 draw with Cameroon
on Thursday night in the World Cup opener for both teams.
	   It was the 16th goal in World Cup qualifying and finals matches
for the 34-year-old captain, breaking the Austrian record held by
Hans Krankl.
	   On a corner kick from the right side, defender Anton Pfeffer
headed the ball to Polster, who took two steps and put his shot
into the roof of the net, skimming the bottom of the crossbar.
	   Cameroon had taken a 1-0 lead in the 77th minute when Pierre
Njanka, making only his third international appearance, evaded two
defenders in a spectacular 40-meter (yard) run.
	   Starting just beyond the midfield line, Njanka sidestepped
Wolfgang Feiersinger and then Peter Schoettel before blasting his
shot over diving goalkeeper Michael Konsel.
	   The victory created a four-way tie on points in World Cup Group
B. The other two teams in the group, Italy and Chile, drew 2-2
earlier in the day.
	   Njanka's goal livened up a game that had featured slips, slides,
pushes and great saves on the wet turf of the new Municipal
Stadium, which was subject to heavy rains just before kickoff.
	   Konsel made three outstanding stops, while Cameroon's Jacques
Sango'o had two tough saves as the match appeared headed for a
scoreless draw.
	   Twice, Konsel leapt to make fingertip saves, against Didier
Angibeau in the first half and against Pierre Wome in the second.
	   Austria didn't test Sango'o until the 71st minute, when he
knocked a shot from Polster to a defender, who cleared it to the
side. Sango'o also pushed away an attempt by Pfeifenberger in the
74th.

	   As a result of the extended regional currency crisis, foreign
investments in the country for the first five months of the year
slipped to P133.65 billion, down by 24.65% from P177.38 billion
over the same period last year.
	   Despite the slight drop, the Board of Investments (BOI) said
foreign equity rose 43.3% to P25.98 billion, up from P18 billion
last year. The leading country-investors were Hongkong, the US,
China, Japan, Virgin Islands, Canada, and Great Britain.
	   ``This is significant because other Asian countries have
experienced negative foreign interest in the wake of last year's
crisis,'' BOI managing head Melito Salazar said. ``What we are
seeing is temporary belt-tightening among local firms, but expanded
interest from foreign companies.''
	   He underscored the country's ``attractiveness as an investment
destination which is based on solid fundamentals and reforms.''
	   Of the total BOI-approved projects, 111 are new, including 13
regional headquarters and two projects without incentives. The
other seven are existing projects.
	   Based on the figures released by the BOI, the sectors that
attracted substantial investments were energy related projects
(P57.2 billion), construction/housing components (P46.9 billion),
public utilities (P15.5 billion), tourism-oriented services (P5
billion), and infrastructure/industrial services (P4.4 billion).
	   The BOI said these projects are expected to generate at least
16,000 jobs before the year ends.
	   On the regional level, the top grossers in terms of project cost
were Region 1 (P44.8 billion), Region 4 (P44.5 billion), Region 9
(P14.2 billion), Region 7 (P4.2 billion), NCR (P3.4 billion), and
Region 3 (P3.2 billion).
	   Last month, the BOI approved a total 20 projects with an
estimated investment requirement of P18.17 billion. These consisted
of 17 new and expansion projects and three regional headquarters.
	   Equity investments last month reached a total P5.43 billion.
	   Of the amount, P3.45 billion were commitments by foreign
nationals, most of which came from Canada and Europe. Compared with
the same month last year, equity commitments by foreign nationals
increased by 132%.
	   Top grossers for May were construction/housing components
(P15.96 billion), tourism-oriented service (P766 million), wood
products (P762.9 million), and the infrastructure/industrial
service sector (P513.6 million).
	   Region 4 led the way in terms of project cost by yielding P15.7
billion worth of investments. This was followed by Region 10
(P777.58 million) and CAR (P725.79 million).
	   The BOI said a total P3.45 billion foreign equity investments
were committed by 10 countries with Canada, Norway, and Germany
leading the pack.

	   MALAYSIA'S trade with Britain, which more than doubled last year
despite a tumultuous second half, is ``holding up well''.
	   British High Commissioner to Malaysia, Mr David Moss, who
admitted to have been impressed with the sheer size of the trade
between the two countries when he first came to Malaysia in 1994,
said there has also been no decline in the number of British
businessmen coming to Malaysia this year.
	   ``We had wondered whether all the news about the downturn in the
region would lead to a falling off in the flow but the numbers have
held up well,'' he said in an interview with Business Times to
coincide with Queen Elizabeth II's birthday.
	   Moss said since 1996, Britain has been sending a trade mission
each month to Malaysia.
	   ``We are keeping up the rhythm of one trade mission a month,''
he added.
	   Malaysia is Britain's 29th largest trading partner while Britain
is Malaysia's eighth largest partner. Last year, their bilateral
trade almost doubled to E5 billion (E1  &QC;  RM6.52) from E2.6 billion
in 1996.
	   In terms of investments, Moss said, the enquiries about Malaysia
from prospective British investors have kept coming to the high
commission. The Invest in Britain Bureau, the agency responsible
for the flow of foreign investments into Britain, is also getting
enquiries from Malaysian parties.
	   ``For British investors in Malaysia, they know that the downturn
is going to be temporary. They know that the economy is basically
sound and will come out of the downturn. They want to be here for
the long term. They will continue to look at the investment
possibilities,'' Moss said.
	   According to Malaysian Industrial Development Authority, there
were 23 applications from the British investors to start projects
in Malaysia, with investments of RM384 million last year. In 1996,
there had been the same number of applications from the UK, but
involving only RM86.76 million in investments.
	   Bank Negara Malaysia figures showed that Malaysia's investments
in the UK totalled RM561 million last year. ``In the recent two to
three years, there were more signs of Malaysian investments in
Britain. These were some high-profile investments,'' he said,
citing MUI's acquisition of Laura Ashley as a example.
	   Moss said he believes Malaysia should export its way to get out
of the difficulties. And as the European Union is one of the most
important markets, Britain is the the natural base for Malaysian
companies which want to operate there.
	   ``I think what we are finding, and I guess it is true for
Malaysian companies, is that we have got beyond the stage where you
cannot export by having a manufacturing operations 7,000 miles away
and sending people to Malaysia expecting to sell. You have to have
an operation in Malaysia.
	   ``You have to look now at joint ventures or other forms of
partnerships here. That is probably going to be true in reverse for
Malaysian companies. They are going to find that if they want to
export on any real scale to Europe, they have to set up operations
at the other end.
	   ``Investments are long-term business and it is not good to just
stop because of the economic downturn. You have to keep going,'' he
said.
	   On a broader perspective, Moss said, Britain, which has been a
``blue sea trader'' looking at horizons beyond Europe, has a big
role to play in East Asia.
	   He said the British presidency of the European Union came at a
good time, adding that ``Britain probably has a wider experience
with Asia than any other European country. We have enormous range
of connections in Asia.''
	   Besides the specific measures arising out of the Asia-Europe
Meeting in London recently, Moss said, the most important thing
that the EU can do now for East Asia, including Malaysia, is to
keep its markets open to all the exports from East Asia.
	   ``That the European leaders have pledged to do - to keep our
markets open - because you have heard from the Malaysian Government
that Malaysia does need to increase its exports but it cannot
increase its exports if the main markets are close.
	   ``We have pledged to keep our markets open and I think that is
the most important single step by far,'' he said.

	   TENAGA Nasional Bhd has described its plan to acquire a stake in
Malakoff through a share swap in TNB Janamanjung Sdn Bhd and Segari
Energy Ventures Sdn Bhd as a ``strategic move'' to maximise the
value of the utility's assets.
	   Tenaga executive chairman Datuk Dr Ahmad Tajuddin Ali said under
the present financial situation, the utility had to find an
alternative way to obtain good returns from its assets.
	   ``From the many proposals that we looked at, we believe that
this is the best option for us. We do not want to go to the
Government ...
	   ``Tenaga already has a huge capital expenditure and needs to
raise funds constantly. Continuous borrowings for this project
(Janamanjung) will be a strain on our gearing,'' Tajuddin told
Business Times in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Tenaga announced on Tuesday its intention to purchase at least
20 per cent in Malakoff after disposing of its stake in Janamanjung
and up to 20 per cent in Segari Energy Ventures Sdn Bhd.
	   Malakoff will issue new shares of RM1 each to Tenaga in the
exercise.
	   The number of shares to be issued will only be determined upon
finalisation of evaluations of Janamanjung and Segari and the
percentage of Segari to be acquired.
	   Tajuddin said Janamanjung, an important project in the
electricity industry, must be on stream by June 2001.
	   ``The memorandum of understanding signed by the two parties
includes several clauses such as the commencement date for
operations ... and that the shareholders are the last resort to
fund Janamanjung.
	   ``Our proposed partner, Malakoff, is aware of these conditions
and accept them,'' he said, adding that details of the agreement
will be finalised within two months.
	   The proposed share swap, Tajuddin said, is in accordance with
the restructuring of the industry to create generation companies of
about the same size to compete with each other.
	   Tenaga's intention is to move away from being involved in
generation plants but to hold equity in the power generation
companies.
	   Tenaga also holds equity in Northern Utility Resources Sdn Bhd,
Port Dickson Power Sdn Bhd, Teknologi Tenaga Perlis Consortium Sdn
Bhd and YTL Power Bhd.
	   With the move, Tenaga will be able to convert its future
earnings from Janamanjung to an immediate earnings through
Malakoff, Tajuddin said.
	   ``There is a significant value to Janamanjung now that the
project is in place, including the power purchase agreeement and
the engineering, procurement and construction contract.''
	   Tajuddin said Malakoff - with Tenaga, Malaysian Resources Corp
Bhd and National Power Plc as the majority shareholders - will be
in a better position to secure financing for the project.
	   ``The proposal is a strategic move for both parties. We are
looking at it as a long-term investment. Perhaps later, the company
will be used as a vehicle for overseas investment,'' he said.
	   Asked how Malakoff will finance the project, Tajuddin said:
``This is for Malakoff to decide.''
	   However, sources indicated that Janamanjung may see the
possibility of foreign participation in the project. The possible
candidate for the project is said to be National Power, which will
hold a minority stake.

	   SHARE prices across the region fell sharply yesterday in
reaction to continued worries over the weaknesses of most of the
region's currencies especially the yen and the renewed fears that
China will devalue the yuan.
	   Leading the fall was Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index which nosedived
4.9 per cent or 412.09 points to below the psychological level at
7,979.37 amid the yen concerns and higher interbank interest rates.
	   On the local bourse, the 100-stock Composite Index closed
broadly lower as regional currencies woes took centrestage,
dragging the index to close 15.78 points or 3.12 per cent down to
489.86.
	   Selling activities were rampant across the board due to the
declining ringgit against the US dollar, said analysts.
	   Heavyweight stocks such as Maybank, Tenaga, Telekom, Genting and
Sime Darby tumbled amid worries that a slide in stock markets
across Asia have deepened concerns over their slowing economies.
	   At the close, the broader Emas Index lost 3.26 points to 126.27
while the second board index was down by 1.3 points to 107.57.
	   Across the causeway, Singapore's benchmark index closed 4.5 per
cent lower on fresh currency weakness in the region and
increasingly gloomy corporate prospects. The Straits Times
Industrials Index ended 49.40 points lower to 1,067.81.
	   In Tokyo, the steep fall in all the Asian stock markets and its
battered currency led share prices to close 1.2 per cent lower. The
key Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues lost 190.91 points
to end the day at 15,339.26.
	   Share prices in Seoul tumbled 4.3 per cent when its composite
index closed 14.68 points down at 324.54.
	   Also down was the Taiwan weighted index when it closed 232.50
points or 3.12 per cent lower at 7,223.13, while Bangkok's Stock
Exchange index was down 3.4 per cent to slip below the
psychological 300-point level at 292.10 - its first in a decade.
	   Shares in Manila were also down by 6.62 points to 1,917.87 while
Indonesian stocks fell slightly with the Jakarta Stock Exchange
Composite Index closing 0.7 per cent lower to 408.080.
	   In Sydney, the Australian Stock Exchange's main indicator, the
All Ordinaries index fell 31 points or 1.2 per cent to 2,592.9.

	   DESPITE the economic problems, future prospects of the beer
market are still reasonably good, Carlsberg Malaysia managing
director Datuk Jorgen Bornhoft said recently.
	   Carlsberg, which Bornhoff said has 60 per cent of the market
share, attributes the strong performance to Malaysians who are
quality conscious.
	   ``I do not agree with the notion that more people are drinking
beer because of the economic downturn.
	   ``The Malaysian beer market has always been supported by people
who enjoy their drinks, especially those who drink moderately in
the company of friends.
	   ``As such the trend is continuing. Furthermore, there are those
who are switching from expensive hard liquor to beer during these
times,'' he said at a press conference after the launch of its new
beer, Carl's Reserve.
	   He added that Malaysians on average drink some six litres of
beer.
	   ``Danish people drink 10 times more whereas others in the region
drink about 40 to 50 litres per head.''
	   On the launching of Carl's Reserve, Bornhoff said the new beer
was initially introduced for a limited period as a festive beer for
Chinese New Year in January.
	   ``Carl's Reserve's overwhelming market response and subsequent
positive findings from consumer research led us to conclusively
decide to launch it as a permanent brand within the brewery's
portfolio of brands,'' said Bornhoft.
	   He expects the new beer, which is aimed at the upper segment, to
penetrate some 4 to 5 per cent of the beer market.
	   Carl's Reserve is crystal filtered, giving it a lively and
distinctive taste and with less bitterness when compared with other
regular beers.
	   Carl's Reserve will initially be available in small bottles
only.
	   However, there are plans to introduce cans in the near future.
	   The bottle shape will be such that it is easy to handle and fits
well into today's style of drinking direct from the bottle.
	   Research findings show that the total packaging is superior to
all other brands of beer in the Malaysian market.
	   The brand is positioned as a premium beer.
	   This also means that the brand will be distributed selectively,
available in outlets like hotels, clubs, pubs, restaurants and
major supermarkets.
	   ``We in Carlsberg Malaysia are very optimistic of the many
opportunities that exist now for entrenching Carl's Reserve solidly
in this market, even in these trying times.
	   ``We are going to invest substantially in long-term
brand-building programmes rather than short-term sales-driven
activities, which clearly demonstrates our faith in Malaysia as
well as our confidence in the future of Carl's Reserve,'' Bornhoft
said.
	   He added that Carl's Reserve will be priced around RM5 in the
retail market.

Arafat plans Cabinet reshuffle to avoid no-confidence motion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Faced with an ultimatum by
Palestinian lawmakers to make his government more effectual or
brave a no-confidence motion, Yasser Arafat decided Thursday to
give in and reshuffle his Cabinet, officials said.
	   Assad Abdel Rahman, a senior PLO official said all Palestinian
political groups, including the militant group Hamas would be
consulted regarding the changes.
	   After an evening Cabinet session in Gaza Thursday, Arafat met
with senior PLO officials including Rahman who later briefed
reporters of the Palestinian leader's decision.
	   ``The President has asked the Legislative Council in writing to
postpone its no-confidence session and give the PLO executive
committee one week to ten days in order to consult with all
political groups and come up with a slate for a new Cabinet,''
Rahman said. He added that the new ministerial slate would be
finalized at a June 19 meeting of the PLO executive committee and
``would be presented to the legislative council for a confidence
vote.''
	   On May 30, the 88-member Palestinian legislature gave Arafat two
weeks to respond to complaints about corruption and inaction or
face his first no-confidence motion.
	   Legislators had threatened last year to hold a no-confidence
vote, which would be a major embarrassment for Arafat if it
succeeded, but backed down after Arafat promised members of his
faction, Fatah, that he would sign legislation and carry out
reforms.
	   The Palestinian Legislative Council, as it is officially called,
has gone largely neglected by Arafat and the top Palestinian
leadership. Arafat routinely ignores measures the lawmakers enact.
	   Council members are demanding that Arafat start enforcing their
laws, replace some of his Cabinet ministers and submit the 1998
budget for council approval.
	   Palestinian lawmaker Ziad Abu Amr said he would accept Arafat's
request for a delay in the vote.
	   ``We can postpone the meeting and if nothing is done within ten
days we will call for another special session,'' he told The
Associated Press.
	   Rahman hinted that a new Cabinet may include more members from
the militant group Hamas which opposes peacemaking with Israel. The
current Cabinet already includes two ministers affiliated with
Hamas and while an added Hamas presence would likely complicate the
already tattered Mideast peace process, it would give Palestinians
a broader representation in the Cabinet. Hamas, which also carrys
out charity work, enjoys popular support in refugee camps and
university campuses.
	   ``Hamas is most welcome to join the PLO and Hamas is most
welcome to join the government,'' he said. Hamas however has
rejectd such overtures in the past.
	   An official statement from Thursday's meeting carried by the
Palestinian news agency Wafa did not mention Hamas and a senior
aide to Arafat, Nabil Abourdeneh, said Rahman's comments regarding
Hamas did not represent the position of the government.

World Cup: Polster's late goal give Austria draw with Cameroon

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Anton Polster scored off a corner kick
in second-half injury time to give Austria a 1-1 draw with Cameroon
on Thursday night in the World Cup opener for both teams.
	   It was the 16th goal in World Cup qualifying and finals matches
for the 34-year-old captain, breaking the Austrian record held by
Hans Krankl.
	   On a corner kick from the right side, defender Anton Pfeffer
headed the ball to Polster, who took two steps and put his shot
into the roof of the net, skimming the bottom of the crossbar.
	   Cameroon had taken a 1-0 lead in the 77th minute when Pierre
Njanka, making only his third international appearance, evaded two
defenders in a spectacular 40-meter (yard) run.
	   Starting just beyond the midfield line, Njanka sidestepped
Wolfgang Feiersinger and then Peter Schoettel before blasting his
shot over diving goalkeeper Michael Konsel.
	   The victory created a four-way tie on points in World Cup Group
B. The other two teams in the group, Italy and Chile, drew 2-2
earlier in the day.
	   Njanka's goal livened up a game that had featured slips, slides,
pushes and great saves on the wet turf of the new Municipal
Stadium, which was subject to heavy rains just before kickoff.
	   Konsel made three outstanding stops, while Cameroon's Jacques
Sango'o had two tough saves as the match appeared headed for a
scoreless draw.
	   Twice, Konsel leapt to make fingertip saves, against Didier
Angibeau in the first half and against Pierre Wome in the second.
	   Austria didn't test Sango'o until the 71st minute, when he
knocked a shot from Polster to a defender, who cleared it to the
side. Sango'o also pushed away an attempt by Heimo Pfeifenberger in
the 74th.
	   The game was marred by rough play, and the Austrians appeared
especially frustrated over several dubious tackles by the
Indomitable Lions. However, Paraguayan referee Epifanio Gonzalez
issued only two yellow cards, one to Pfeffer and the other to
Cameroon's Samuel Ipoua.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 
tournament &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LEON, Spain (AP) _ World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov of Russia
finished one point ahead of Bulgarian Grand Master Veselin Topalov
on Thursday after the fourth game in their experimental
computer-aided chess tournament.
	   Kasparov forced the young Bulgarian playing the white pieces to
a draw in the first match of the day _ the third of the six-game
tournament held in this northern Spanish city.
	   The Russian chess star made sure he won his own advantage with
the whites in the fourth game pushing Topalov into a frantic
defense he could not maintain.
	   With time running out, each player is allowed only 60 minutes
each, the last few moves required a rapidity that ruled out

	   Both players appeared more relaxed with the novelty of

the competition table.
	   On several occasions during the stalemate game Kasparov appeared
angered by the Chessmaster 5500 program, designed by the U.S.
company Mindscape, when it gave Topalov the advantage.
	   With Kasparov now on 2.5 points to Topalov's 1.5, the Russian
needs two draws or one victory from the final two games due Friday.

the loser dlrs 3,000 in the groundbreaking challenged dubbed
``chess of the future'' that seeks to eliminate human error while

	   Without computers, Topalov, 23, the world's No. 4, has defeated
Kasparov twice and lost six of the 15 games they have played. The
remainder were draws.
	   Over the last quarter of a century computers, despite being
barred from professional competitions, have come to dominate the
chess world.
	   Modern programs, many of them designed under Kasparov's
guidance, have proved themselves capable of beating most humans,
including Kasparov himself.

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ The Phoenix Coyotes, who promised a shakeup after
another first-round playoff elimination, traded center Craig Janney
to the Tampa Bay Lightning on Thursday.
	   In return, the Coyotes received left wing Louie Debrusk and a
fifth-round pick in this summer's draft.
	   Janney, an 11-year pro acquired from San Jose in March 1996, had
10 goals and 43 assists for Phoenix last season.
	   In 158 games over 2 1/2 seasons with the Coyotes, he scored 32
goals and had 94 assists.
	   Debrusk, signed by Tampa Bay as a free agent last August after
six seasons with Edmonton, had one goal, two assists and 166
penalty minutes last season.
	   In seven NHL seasons, he has 963 penalty minutes.

	   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France (AP) _ Four days before his team's
World Cup opener, U.S. coach Steve Sampson ripped into his German
counterpart for not respecting the Americans.
	   ``When Berti Vogts walks out 20 minutes before the end of the
Belgium match, that shows a lack of respect for the United States
team,'' Sampson said Thursday. ``In Europe, they have no respect
for the United States. Frankly, we haven't earned it.''
	   Sampson, who was referring to the Americans' 2-0 loss at
Brussels on Feb. 25, is openly using the respect issue to motivate
his players going into Monday's game in Paris.

Eritrea urges council action to stop Ethiopian attacks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment from British ambassador in new last graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Eritrea called Thursday on the Security
Council to do everything in its power to stop the border clashes
with Ethiopia.
	   In a letter to the council president, the Eritrean U.N.
ambassador, Haile Menkerios, accused Ethiopia of threatening to
strike boats in its ports and planes in its airspace.
	   ``This irresponsible act is not only intended to cut off
commercial air and sea traffic to Eritrea, but is also a direct
threat to the freedom and safety of international commercial
traffic,'' he wrote.
	   The two Horn of Africa nations, which less than a decade ago
were part of the same country, are battling over several stretches
of border land. The fighting that erupted May 6 prompted an array
of mediation attempts.
	   ``We call upon the council to condemn and do everything in its
power to stop it in time,'' the ambassador wrote.
	   Speaking on behalf of the European Union, Britain's U.N.
ambassador, John Weston, ``urged both parties to agree to a
cease-fire and to resume cooperation'' with mediators. Weston's
comments were contained in a letter Thursday to U.N. chief Kofi
Annan.

Rodman offers to pay for funeral of man dragged to death
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NANCY ARMOUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Dennis Rodman really isn't a bad guy. Honest.
	   To prove it, the National Basketball Association's bad boy has
offered to pay the funeral expenses of the black hitchhiker who was
chained to a pickup truck and dragged to death.
	   ``A lot of people don't give me credit for doing a lot of good
things around the country, so I have to do something like this so
people will recognize the good side of Dennis Rodman,'' he said
after the Chicago Bulls practiced Thursday.
	   Three white men, including two with tattoos indicating white
supremacist beliefs, have been charged in James Byrd Jr.'s death.
	   ``I'm from Texas,'' Rodman said. ``I think it was a damn shame
that the racism in this country had to go that low before someone
just freaks out and does something about it.''
	   Byrd's mangled torso was found Sunday on a bumpy, winding
country road about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from his Jasper home.
The 49-year-old's severed head, neck and right arm were about a
mile away. Investigators found a trail of blood along a 2-mile
(3.2-kilometer) stretch of road.
	   Rodman is known more for his outlandish behavior, ever-changing
hair color and multitude of tattoos than he is for his generosity.
The NBA fined him dlrs 10,000 on Monday after he blew off a
mandatory media session.
	   But Rodman said he decided to do something for Byrd's family as
soon as he heard about the gruesome death earlier this week. Rodman
went to high school in Dallas and was with the San Antonio Spurs
for two seasons.
	   ``It's not because he's black and I'm black and I'm trying to do
something for the black community,'' he said. ``It's more just the
fact that it's a brutal crime where someone shouldn't have been in
that situation. I'd do it for anybody else if it happened that
way.''
	   The Rev. Jesse Jackson announced Rodman's offer Wednesday. A
date for the funeral has not been announced, but Rodman said he
won't be there.
	   ``I think I did enough,'' he said. ``My heart goes out to the
family. It's a damn shame when something like this happens and
people don't really acknowledge it, they just blow it off.
	   ``Hopefully, people will look at me in a different light,
somewhat.''

Baggio gets redemption, Polster sets record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cameroon-Austria &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Roberto Baggio got redemption and Anton Polster set
a record as each player helped his team salvage a draw, but
Cameroon's Pierre Njanka had the most spectacular goal Thursday on
the second day of the World Cup.
	   Baggio, who missed the penalty kick that ended the World Cup
four years ago, this time found the mark in the 84th minute to lift
Italy to a 2-2 draw with Chile.
	   Polster, making his 91st international appearance, scored off a
corner kick in second-half injury time to give Austria a 1-1 draw
with Cameroon. It was the 16th goal in World Cup qualifying and
finals matches for the 34-year-old captain, breaking the Austrian
record held by Hans Krankl.
	   Polster's goal was dramatic because of its timing, but it paled
in electricity compared to the one netted by World Cup newcomer
Njanka, who evaded two defenders in a brilliant 40-meter (yard) run
to give Cameroon a 1-0 lead in the 77th minute.
	   Making only his third international appearance, Njanka started
just beyond the midfield line, sidestepped Wolfgang Feiersinger and
then Peter Schoettel before blasting his shot over diving
goalkeeper Michael Konsel on the wet turf in Toulouse.
	   Earlier, in Bordeaux, Baggio's penalty kick came just as Chile
appeared destined to pull the first major upset of France '98.
	   Baggio, who made all 11 penalty kicks he took in Italian league
play this year and would not have been in starting lineup were it
not for an injury to Alessandro Del Piero, took the penalty after
defender Ronald Fuentes was whistled for a hand ball in the box.
	   ``Certainly I thought of four years ago,'' Baggio said. ``But
then I told myself I was going to put the ball into the net this
time.''
	   ``Luckily I did,'' he added with a smile.
	   Baggio also assisted on Italy's first goal, scored by Christian
Vieri in the 10th minute.
	   Still, the draw marked another slow start for Italy, which fell
1-0 to Ireland in its opener four years ago before rallying to
become the eventual runner-up to Brazil. Baggio took the final shot
in the penalty shootout against Brazil and missed high.
	   ``What happened four years ago doesn't count right now,'' said
Italy's coach, Cesare Maldini. ``I was pleased with the team's
reaction and its thirst for a goal.''
	   In a game played in intermittent downpours and sunshine in
Bordeaux, Marcelo Salas scored in first-half injury time and in the
49th minute for the Chileans, who have been made it past the first
round only once six previous World Cup appearances _ and that was
when they hosted the tournament in 1962.
	   Salas, who will join Italy's Lazio next season in a dlrs 20
million transfer, scored 11 goals in qualifying play _ two less
than the entire Italian team.
	   Later Thursday, Cameroon and Austria played in another Group B
match in Toulouse. Three games are set for Friday: South
Arabia-Denmark in Lens, France-South Africa in Marseille and
Paraguay-Bulgaria in Montpellier.
	   Japan, in the World Cup for the first time, doesn't open play
until Sunday against Argentina, but that's too soon for many
Japanese fans who bought tickets that have failed to materialize.
	   While five Japanese travel agencies reportedly were deciding to
cancel World Cup tours because some 12,000 tickets haven't turned
up, a group of 76 fans already at the team's training camp at
Aix-en-Provence waited to find out if even that much-smaller number
could be met.
	   ``I'm trying to be optimistic,'' said Masami Tachi, a
34-year-old housewife from Tokyo. ``But if we don't get tickets
soon, we're going to take the tour coordinator hostage. We will not
kill him.''
	   At other training camps, injuries were the main concern.
	   Germany lost defensive midfielder Steffen Freund for at least 10
days with a pulled a muscle in his right calf. He'll likely miss
two games.
	   Forward Nwankwo Kanu practiced with Nigeria for the first time
since the Olympic champions arrived in France, although another
striker, Daniel Amokachi, sat out with a twisted right knee.
	   Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp, fighting a hamstring injury, went
through a full _ though not very strenuous _ training session and
emerged hopeful of playing Saturday against the Belgians.
	   Spying also became an issue Thursday, with Spanish coach Javier
Clemente venting anger after some photographers attempted to enter
a closed practice session.
	   And Croatia was upset when its own spies were sent away from an
open practice held by Jamaica, its first World Cup opponent.
Croatian soccer federation president Branko Miksa said tournament
rules say no one can be barred from an open practice, not even
officials from other teams.
	   ``We don't want to make a big noise about this, but we will send
a protest to FIFA and the organizing committee,'' he said.
	   And, in a court in Paris, a Scottish soccer fan was sentenced to
a two-month suspended sentence for throwing beer cans at a French
policeman after Tuesday night's pre-Cup parade.
	   Christopher Kyles, 23, of Aberdeen, apologized to the court,
admitted being drunk and said he remembered none of his actions.

	   LEON, Spain (AP) _ World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov of Russia
held a one point lead Thursday over the Bulgarian Grand Master
Veselin Topalov on the second day of their experimental
computer-aided chess tournament.
	   Two matches are played each day over the three-day competition
held in this northern Spanish city.
	   In the first game Thursday Kasparov forced the young Bulgarian
playing the white pieces to a draw.
	   Then the Russian made sure he won his own advantage with the
whites in the second game of the day pushing Topalov into a frantic
but in the end futile defense.
	   With time running out, each player is allowed only 60 minutes
each, the last few moves required a rapidity that ruled out
consultation with the computer.
	   Both players appeared more relaxed with the novelty of
constantly turning to their electronic playing partners for help at
the competition table.
	   On several occasions during the stalemate game Kasparov appeared
angered by the Chessmaster 5500 program, designed by the U.S.

	   With Kasparov now on 2.5 points to Topalov's 1.5, the Russian

Polgar leads 4-2 after third day of play against Karpov
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary's Judit Polgar, the world's top
woman chess player, took a 4-2 lead Thursday over world chess
champion Anatoly Karpov, guaranteeing her at least a tie in the
four-day competition.
	   ``I'm very glad to be two `goals' ahead, to use soccer
terminology, given it's World Cup time,'' a tired, but smiling
Polgar, 21, said after the third day of competition.
	   Karpov, 47, who was already a grand master before Polgar was
born, left the room immediately after the game.
	   Both matches Thursday ended in ties, the first after 75 moves
and the second after 49 moves. A win earns one point, a tie a half
point.
	   ``Karpov has found his pace and played a faster game today,''
Polgar said. ``On Friday, I will have to be careful not to get
over-confident.''
	   The four-day, eight-game speed match competition allots 30
minutes per game to each player. It is the first time in chess
history that the top male and female players have competed against
each other.

Australian test player to undergo additional drug testing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian rugby league international
Robbie O'Davis has reportedly recorded elevated levels of a
naturally occurring hormone and will undergo further drug testing.
	   The Sydney Morning Herald said Friday that Newcastle fullback
O'Davis has recorded an epitestosterone level greater than 6 to 1
and will have to undergo further tests to track his personal
testosterone level.
	   If scientists at the Australian Government Analytical Laboratory
in Sydney determine those tests reveal levels consistent with
steroid use, his test will be registered as positive, the newspaper
said.
	   That means the Australian international could face a two-year
ban under the National Rugby League's revamped penalty code.
	   When asked by the newspaper to comment on the allegation on
Thursday night, O'Davis replied: ``You're kidding, aren't you?
	   ``I don't know where you got the story from and please don't
bother me at home again.''
	   O'Davis has never tested positive and if he is found to have
used steroids it would make him the first player to test positive
to substances other than marijuana and pseudoephedrines since the
NRL reviewed its policy.
	   O'Davis, who was a late inclusion in the Queensland State of
Origin team for next Friday's series-deciding game, was tested a
month ago as part of a random check by the Australian Sports Drug
Agency.
	   He will be required to provide three more samples while
scientists assess his natural testosterone level. (djp)

Els withdraws from Buick Classic with back spasms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOEL STASHENKO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARRISON, New York (AP) _ Ernie Els withdrew from the Buick
Classic Thursday because of back spasms, and said it was unclear
whether he would be able to defend his U.S. Open championship
starting June 18 at The Olympic Club in San Francisco.
	   ``Obviously next week is a day-to-day thing at this point,'' he
said after pulling out on the ninth hole of the opening round of a
tournament he had won two straight times. ``I certainly hope I can
take care of this soon, though.''
	   Els joins a veritable Who's Who of PGA Tour golfers with back
problems, including Tiger Woods, Fred Couples and Davis Love III.
	   Els said his back has been sore for about three weeks, but that
the spasm which forced his withdrawal flared up Wednesday night.
	   Though he had trainers work on his back prior to playing
Thursday morning, Els said he was ``still hurting on the first
hole.''
	   ``I tried to make it through but I just couldn't do it,'' he
said.
	   Els birdied No. 10, the first hole he played Thursday, but
bogeyed Nos. 12, 15, 16 and 17 before calling a tournament official
over on the 18th fairway and withdrawing.
	   His playing partner, Love, said that when he saw Els getting
treatment prior to Thursday's round, he knew the South African was
in trouble.
	   ``When you see a guy on the table right before he's going to go
play, you know he's not doing good,'' Love said. ``He did not hit
the ball very good and he didn't make a putt. He didn't seem very
happy. But he didn't complain. Ernie's not the kind of guy who
says, `Oh, my back hurts.'''
	   Before Els left the course, Love gave him the name of Tom Boers,
a Columbus, Georgia, therapist who specializes in treating
professional golfers through the manipulation of their backs and
the development of an exercise regimen. Boers has also worked on
Couples, Phil Mickelson, Brad Faxon and Glen Day, among other tour
players.
	   In a statement released through the PGA Tour, Els said he might
visit Boers' Hugston Clinic or fly to his home in Orlando, Florida
and seek treatment there.
	   Els had been the back-to-back, wire-to-wire winner of the last
two Buick Classics and he said he was disappointed that he could
not play this week in a tournament where he has finished no worse
than fourth in four starts.
	   ``This tournament has meant a lot to me through the years,'' he
said. ``I am sorry I can't defend my title.''
	   Steve Lowery, who was at 5-under after Thursday's round, said
the thick rough at the Westchester County Club could have convinced
Els to quit.
	   ``I think he was probably a little afraid of playing out of the
rough here,'' Lowery said. ``You play here, hit it in the rough and
you might not be able to play next week.''
	   Tom Lehman, whom Els beat by two strokes at the 1997 U.S. Open,
said he hopes Els is healthy enough to defend his title next week.
	   ``Even with the slightest twinge I think he made a good decision
by withdrawing,'' Lehman said.

Polgar leads 4-2 after third day of play against Karpov

champions. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary's Judit Polgar, the world's top
woman chess player, took a 4-2 lead Thursday over world chess
champion Anatoly Karpov, guaranteeing her at least a tie in the
four-day competition.
	   ``I'm very glad to be two `goals' ahead, to use soccer
terminology, given it's World Cup time,'' a tired, but smiling
Polgar, 21, said after the third day of competition.
	   Karpov, 47, who was already a grand master before Polgar was
born, left the room immediately after the game.
	   Both matches Thursday ended in ties, the first after 75 moves
and the second after 49 moves. A win earns one point, a tie a half
point.
	   ``Karpov has found his pace and played a faster game today,''
Polgar said. ``On Friday, I will have to be careful not to get
over-confident.''
	   The four-day, eight-game speed match competition allots 30
minutes per game to each player. It is the first time in chess
history that the top male and female players have competed against
each other.
	   Karpov is the reigning champion of the World Chess Federation,
known by its French acronym FIDE, although fellow Russian Garry
Kasparov is considered the true world champion.

Kasparov edges ahead of Topalov in computer-assisted chess
</HEADLINE>
tournament &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LEON, Spain (AP) _ World chess champion Garry Kasparov of Russia
held a one point lead Thursday over the Bulgarian Grand Master
Veselin Topalov after the second day of their experimental
computer-aided chess tournament.
	   Kasparov forced the young Bulgarian playing the white pieces to
a draw in their first match Thursday. Then the Russian, playing the
whites, pushed Topalov into a frantic but in the end futile defense
to capture the second match.
	   Two matches are played each day during the three-day competition
in this northern Spanish city.
	   With time running out, each player is allowed only 60 minutes.
The last few moves required speed that ruled out consultation with
the computer.
	   Both players appeared more relaxed with the novelty of
constantly turning to their electronic playing partners for help at
the competition table.
	   On several occasions during the stalemate game, Kasparov
appeared angered by the Chessmaster 5500 program, designed by the
U.S. company Mindscape, when it gave Topalov the advantage.
	   With Kasparov now on 2.5 points to Topalov's 1.5, the Russian
needs two draws or one victory during the final two games Friday to
clinch the competition.
	   No title is at stake, but the winner will earn dlrs 6,600 and
the loser dlrs 3,000. The challenge, dubbed ``chess of the
future,'' seeks to eliminate human error while retaining human
imagination and creativity.
	   Without computers, Topalov, 23, the world's No. 4, has defeated
Kasparov twice and lost six of the 15 games they have played. The
remainder were draws.
	   Despite being barred from professional competitions, computers
have come to dominate the chess world over the last quarter
century.
	   Modern programs, many of them designed under Kasparov's
guidance, have become capable of beating most humans, including
Kasparov himself.
	   Kasparov is considered the world's top chess player, although
fellow Russian Anatoly Karpov is the reigning champion of the World
Chess Federation.

World Cup: Polster's late goal give Austria draw with Cameroon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS more detail, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Anton Polster scored off a corner kick
in second-half injury time to give Austria a 1-1 draw with Cameroon
on Thursday night in the World Cup opener for both teams.
	   It was the 16th goal in World Cup qualifying and finals matches
for the 34-year-old captain, breaking the Austrian record held by
Hans Krankl.
	   On a corner kick from the right side, defender Anton Pfeffer
headed the ball to Polster, who took two steps and put his shot
into the roof of the net, skimming the bottom of the crossbar.
	   ``That we managed to equalize things, that turned into a great
feeling,'' Austrian coach Herbert Prohaska said.
	   Cameroon had taken a 1-0 lead in the 77th minute when Pierre
Njanka, making only his third international appearance, evaded two
defenders in a spectacular 40-meter (yard) run.
	   Starting just beyond the midfield line, Njanka sidestepped
Wolfgang Feiersinger and then Peter Schoettel before blasting his
shot over diving goalkeeper Michael Konsel.
	   The victory created a four-way tie on points in World Cup Group
B. The other two teams in the group, Italy and Chile, drew 2-2
earlier in the day.
	   ``We're starting from scratch,'' Prohaska said. ``It was all
zero points before and it's all one point now.''
	   Njanka's goal was a one-man effort, characterizing much of
Cameroon's play. It also livened up a game that had featured slips,
slides, pushes and great saves on the wet turf of the new Municipal
Stadium, which was subject to heavy rains just before kickoff.
	   Though the Austrians had possession for much of the first half,
the African squad opened up in the second half, often threatening
but just as often losing out in front of the Austrian goal with
passes that went nowhere.
	   Cameroon coach Claude Leroy said that he was happy with his
team's effort, particularly in the second half.
	   ``Initially, we played the ball too deeply, and then I told the
players to get it up some,'' Leroy said.
	   Konsel made three outstanding stops, while Cameroon's Jacques
Sango'o had two tough saves as the match appeared headed for a
scoreless draw.
	   Twice, Konsel leapt to make fingertip saves, against Didier
Angibeau in the first half and against Pierre Wome in the second.
	   Austria didn't test Sango'o until the 71st minute, when he
knocked a shot from Polster to defender Rigobert Song, who cleared
it to the side. Sango'o also held onto an attempt by Heimo
Pfeifenberger in the 74th.
	   The game was marred by rough play, and the Austrians appeared
especially frustrated over several dubious tackles by the
Indomitable Lions. However, Paraguayan referee Epifanio Gonzalez
issued only two yellow cards, one to Pfeffer and the other to
Cameroon's Samuel Ipoua.

IMF said to demand Russian budget cuts, tax reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS paras 4-7, quotes from U.S. treasury official.
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund wants Russia to
adopt a strict austerity plan in exchange for billions of dollars
in new loans, a top Western banking official said Thursday.
	   It's not clear precisely what the IMF is offering, however, or
whether Russia is willing or able to agree to the deal.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was
familiar with a letter from the IMF to the Russian government
outlining its demands: that Russia slash its budget deficit, pass a
tax reform package, break up the Gazprom energy monopoly and be
more open about its statistics and fiscal activities.
	   In Washington, Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers
declined to say when Russia will get new IMF support, but he did
say the fund is ``in close touch, as they are very frequently,''
with Russian authorities.
	   He called attention to U.S. President Bill Clinton's statement
that he would support additional aid to Russia ``as it become
necessary and appropriate.''
	   The Russian government already claims to be pursuing several of
the reforms demanded by the IMF, although it faces resistance in
the Communist-dominated lower house of parliament.
	   Since Russia's financial markets collapsed late last month,
there has been growing speculation that the country is seeking an
additional dlrs 5 billion to dlrs 10 billion in loans from the IMF
or the Group of Eight leading industrial countries.
	   The Russian stock market perked up last week on rumors of an
emergency bailout plan. It has since slumped again, and continued
to sink Thursday, in part on doubts that an IMF bailout is
imminent.
	   The government took one new step Thursday to raise revenue,
authorizing natural gas discounts of up to 30 percent to customers
who pay in cash.
	   The discount is aimed at improving the cash balance of Gazprom,
the nation's largest tax delinquent. Gazprom has said it cannot pay
taxes because its customers cannot pay their bills in cash.
	   The New York Times reported Thursday that the demands presented
by the IMF included cutting the budget deficit nearly in half, from
the current goal of 4.5 percent of gross domestic product to 2.5
percent of GDP. The Western banking official here said he could
confirm the substance of the Times report.
	   He said it wasn't clear how much money the IMF might be willing
to loan Russia. ``No amounts are being talked about,'' he said.
	   The new government of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko has been
moving to cut spending in an effort to further reduce the deficit.
	   The government is also pushing a tax reform package that is
stuck in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament.
	   According to The Times, the IMF wants that measure passed before
the Duma recesses next month.
	   Charles Blitzer, a former head of the World Bank office in
Moscow who now follows Eastern European markets for a U.S.
investment bank in London, said he agreed with the IMF strategy,
but thought it might be pushing too hard.
	   ``It's high time that the Russians start to attack some of their
problems and to do it in a meaningful way,'' he said. But Blitzer
said there was a danger in the IMF making too many demands, or
demands that the Russians were likely to fail to carry out.
	   ``Because if they fail one more time, it may not be a financial
crisis but a financial meltdown,'' he said.

Jacobs likes taking the course as a winner, finally

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ For his first three years on the PGA
Senior Tour friends would tell John Jacobs he'd win eventually.
He'd agree, but in his heart he'd begun to wonder.
	   ``I knew I was going to make money, but sure, you begin to doubt
if you're going to win,'' said Jacobs, who got his first PGA tour
victory of any kind in 30 years as a professional last weekend in
the Nationwide Championship in Atlanta.
	   ``When you haven't won, it becomes a mental pressure. I know I'm
bouncing on my toes a little more this week. I feel like a monkey's
off my back,'' he said Thursday after a practice round for the
BellSouth Classic at the Springhouse Golf Club.
	   ``Before I wanted to make a good check and hope I could win. Now
I know I can win. It's a little different deal.''
	   Jacobs wasn't exactly hacking his way around the senior circuit.
He made dlrs 1.3 million the last two years, with three
second-place finishes, four thirds and 36 top 10s in 68
tournaments.
	   He said he and his golf game have matured in recent years.
	   ``Now I have a couple of glasses of wine, and when I was a kid
it was three bottles of wine and where do we go next,'' he said.
``When this game comes easy to you, like it did to me as a kid, it
won't reward you. I don't take anything for granted out here now.''
	   Jacobs said he was playing poorly earlier in the year _ although
he's ninth on the money list _ and ``hit more balls the last four
of five weeks than I've hit in my whole career.''
	   ``There's no such thing as no practice and win a lot of money,''
he said. ``I realize now you only get rewards for what you put into
this game.''
	   Among those in this weekend's field to whom rewards have been
coming in bunches are the tour's two hottest players, three-time
winners Hale Irwin and Gil Morgan, the defending BellSouth
champion.
	   But they are not the only problems.
	   ``There's probably 40 guys out here who, when they get in the
hunt, Hale Irwin and Gil Morgan aren't going to run them off,''
Jacobs said. ``But those two are playing well.''
	   Jacobs, Irwin and some of the other longer hitters could have an
advantage on the 6,783-yard (6,172-meter), par-72 Springhouse
course, still soggy from 7 inches of rain in the last week. Plus
the new zoysia fairways, when wet, provide less roll than the old
bermuda grass did.
	   ``Between the rain and the zoysia we're seeing a much different
course,'' said Irwin, who hasn't finished out of the top five in
nine tournaments this year. ``The length will change appreciably.''
	   Irwin and Morgan were second and third last week behind Jacobs,
and have seemed more or less glued to the top of the leader board
all season.
	   ``Overall my game is in pretty good shape,'' said Morgan, who
finished 14-under par last year to beat John Bland by two strokes
for his second straight victory.
	   ``It's probably not as good as it was at this time last year,
when I was on a pretty hot streak coming in here, but maybe the
good vibes from last year will carry me through.''
	   The three-day tournament begins Friday.

	   CHAVAJEVAL, Mexico (AP) _ Soldiers were gone from this Indian
village Thursday, but evidence of a clash between the army and
rebels was everywhere: smashed desks in the farm hall, blood
smeared on the health clinic's concrete floor, the town store's
interior ransacked.
	   Dozens of men in Zapatista rebel uniforms patrolled the town's
square, some with assault rifles.
	   Although the government has said its troops were fired upon as
they entered the village Wednesday, residents said that the army
rolled in shooting tear gas and mortars, and that only then
residents responded with gunfire.
	   Nine people were killed, including one policeman, and as many as
nine were injured. Fifty-two people were arrested before the troops
withdrew Wednesday afternoon. It was among the deadliest clashes
since the rebels' January 1994 uprising for Indian rights and
greater democracy.
	   Some villagers said the army chased residents into the lush
green hills surrounding the village. No women or children could be
seen in Chavajeval Thursday.
	   ``All the government gives us is gunshots,'' said a man dressed
in a Zapatista uniform and carrying a rifle, who gave his name as
Adolfo Lopez Mateos _ the name of a former Mexican president.
	   Neither he nor the other uniformed men would identify themselves
as Zapatistas _ or say who they were at all. ``There's no uniform
here,'' said Lopez Mateos, who like the others wore the Zapatistas'
typical dark brown shirt, charcoal gray pants and sturdy hiking
boots, a blue ski mask tucked into his belt.
	   Some of the men carried AK-47s, others smaller rifles. Some
carried mock weapons made of wood, of the type that Zapatistas use
to train recruits.
	   Wednesday's clash appears to have been the first direct
confrontation between government forces and Zapatista rebels in
years, and some analysts said it could signal a new willingness on
the part of the government to use force to crush rebel support.
	   ``Since public opinion is in favor of negotiating an end to the
Chiapas conflict, the government has decided to use force without
saying so,'' said Lorenzo Meyer, a prominent academic in Mexico
City. ``It's what you call in English a `trial balloon.' If the
Mexican people don't react strongly, the government will
continue.''
	   A leader of the Zapatistas' civilian wing, Javier Elorriaga, had
predicted such an attack days earlier, saying it would coincide
with the World Cup soccer tournament, which began Wednesday in
France.
	   ``With the World Cup, people forget what's happening in the
country,'' he told The Associated Press. ``Those are the moments in
which the government does its most shameless deeds.''
	   The signs of the clash were everywhere in Chavajeval, a remote
Tzotzil Indian hamlet 25 miles (40 kms) north of the city of San
Cristobal, on the side of a canyon covered in lush vegetation.
	   In the village's health clinic, three young men lounged on metal
cots without mattresses. On the floor beside them was a large
quantity of smeared dried blood. The men, who didn't give their
names, said they hadn't noticed it.
	   Many villagers said the soldiers had looted stores and houses
during their raids.
	   The door of the Sanchez family's store had been ripped off and
stood on its side, half blocking the entry. Inside, bags of corn
were scattered on the floor amid empty soda bottles, beans and
human excrement.
	   Domingo Sanchez, 18, leaned against the door. ``Who will pay for
this?'' he asked.
	   Up the hill, in the municipal seat of El Bosque, a banner hung
from the town hall: ``The residents of El Bosque thank you, Mr.
Governor, for your support in restoring the state of law.''
	   About a dozen state policemen carrying automatic rifles
patrolled the rooftop and around the doors of the building.

Blair tells Israeli peace groups Netanyahu must show courage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair wrote in a
letter to Israeli peace groups Thursday that it he hoped Israeli
premier Benjamin Netanyahu would show courage and vision in the
Middle East peace process.
	   Blair visited the region in April and facilitated separate talks
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright held in London in May
with Prime Minister Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
in an effort to help break a 15 month impasse in talks.
	   ``I have made clear that the United Kingdom and European Union
have an important contribution to make on the peace process, both
in complementing U.S. mediation efforts and in helping on the
economic side,'' Blair wrote to Peace Now and eight other pro-peace
groups in response to a letter they sent the premier asking for his
help in the stalled process. A copy of the letter was made
available to The Associated Press.
	   ``I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu, as I have done
subsequently, that he must implement the agreements he has made. I
hope that current American efforts to break the deadlock will
succeed. I have welcomed President Arafat's acceptance of the
American ideas. It is now up to Prime Minister Netanyahu to show he
has the courage and vision to respond positively on the outstanding
issues,'' Blair wrote.
	   A United States proposal calling for Israeli troop withdrawals
from the West Bank, Palestinian efforts to fight terrorism and a
halt in Jewish settlement construction has been accepted by the
Palestinians. Israel has not yet accepted the deal.

Thriller writer Hammond Innes dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Hammond Innes, author of 35 thrillers and
adventure novels, has died at age 83, his agent said Thursday.
	   The writer, whose most famous book was ``The Wreck of the Mary
Deare,'' died Wednesday at his home in Kersey, in southeast
England, said Ian Chapman, his agent, friend and former publisher.
	   Ralph Hammond Innes, born July 15, 1914, began his career as a
journalist on the Financial News, which later became the Financial
Times. He wrote his novels under the name Hammond Innes.
	   His writing career began in 1940 when he joined the army,
serving in the Royal Artillery until 1946, first as a gunner,
rising to the rank of major in the 8th Army.
	   Innes' first novel, ``Attack Alarm'' in 1940, was loosely based
on the Battle of Britain.
	   Among his early successes after the World War II, were the sea
story ``Maddon's Rock,'' and ``The Lonely Skier,'' a thriller
published in 1947 and filmed as ``Snowbound'' the following year.
	   Among many of his other novels to follow were ``The Land God
Gave to Cain'' in 1958, ``Harvest of Journeys'' in 1959, ``The
Doomed Oasis'' in 1960, ``Atlantic Fury'' in 1962, ``North Star''
in 1974 and ``The Black Tide'' in 1982. His final novel, ``Delta
Connection'' was published in 1996.
	   In 1959, his ``Wreck of the Mary Deare,'' about an insurance
fraud on the high seas, was made into a Hollywood film starring
Charlton Heston, Gary Cooper and Michael Redgrave.
	   Other films made from his books include, ``Hell Below Zero'' in
1954 and ``Campbell's Kingdom,'' in 1957.
	   Innes was an avid traveler and sailor. His own boat, the Mary
Deare, inspired his most famous book. He and his late wife,
Dorothy, sailed around the coasts of Britain and Europe.
	   ``He worked very hard and was very thorough,'' said Chapman.
``He traveled all over the world and never set a book in a country
without visiting the country first.''
	   Innes and his wife, who died in 1989, had no children.
	   No funeral plans were announced immediately.

Arafat plans Cabinet reshuffle to avoid no-confidence motion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Yasser Arafat announced Thursday
that he would reshuffle his Cabinet, giving in to parliamentary
demands to make his government more effective or face a
no-confidence motion, officials said.
	   All Palestinian political groups, including the militant group
Hamas, will be consulted regarding the changes, said Assad Abdel
Rahman, a senior PLO official.
	   After an evening Cabinet session in Gaza Thursday, Arafat met
with Rahman and other senior PLO officials.
	   Arafat has sent a letter asking the Palestinian Legislative
Council to postpone its no-confidence vote and give PLO leaders up
to ten days to present a new Cabinet, Rahman said.
	   He added that the new ministerial slate would be finalized at a
June 19 meeting of the PLO executive committee and ``would be
presented to the legislative council for a confidence vote.''
	   On May 30, the 88-member Palestinian legislature gave Arafat two
weeks to respond to complaints about corruption and inaction or
face his first no-confidence motion.
	   A no-confidence vote would not affect Arafat's position but
would embarrass the Palestinian leader and force him to make
changes in the Cabinet.
	   Legislators had threatened last year to hold a no-confidence
vote but backed down after Arafat promised to carry out reforms.
	   Arafat and the top Palestinian leadership have paid little
attention to the legislature and routinely ignore measures enacted
by the lawmakers.
	   Council members are demanding that Arafat start enforcing their
laws, replace some of his Cabinet ministers and submit the 1998
budget for council approval.
	   Palestinian lawmaker Ziad Abu Amr said he would accept Arafat's
request for a delay in the vote.
	   ``We can postpone the meeting and if nothing is done within ten
days we will call for another special session,'' he told The
Associated Press.
	   Rahman hinted that a new Cabinet may include more members from
Hamas, which opposes peacemaking with Israel.
	   The current Cabinet already includes two ministers affiliated
with Hamas. While an added Hamas presence would likely complicate
the troubled Mideast peace process, it would give Palestinians a
broader representation in the Cabinet. Hamas, which also carries
out charity work, enjoys popular support in refugee camps and
university campuses.
	   ``Hamas is most welcome to join the PLO and Hamas is most
welcome to join the government,'' he said. Hamas however has
rejected such overtures in the past.
	   A senior aide to Arafat, Nabil Abourdeneh, said Rahman's
comments regarding Hamas did not represent the position of the
government.

Judge orders barge company not to block competitor from landing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ After four days of
testimony, a judge ruled Thursday that Boyson Inc./Ocean Link barge
serivce had unfairly stopped an upstart competitor, Republic Barge
Service, from doing business.
	   Territorial Court Judge Soroya Diase issued an injunction
stopping Boyson from denying access to port facilities at Red Hook
on St. Thomas.
	   During the hearing, Boyson executives admitted setting up a
blockade of 40-foot tractor trailers at Red hook between April 28
and May 4. But operations manager James Boynes said it was done as
a protest against the Port Authority and not to stop Republic from
doing business.
	   In its dispute with the government, Boyson claimed the exclusive
right to use the ramps it had constructed at the barge landing.

Rains helping extinguish fires in southern Mexico
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHELLE RAY ORTIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Long-awaited rain showers have helped
extinguish dozens of fires in southern Mexico, but several blazes
continue to burn, including those in prized rain forest, an
environment official said Thursday.
	   Rains that began two weeks ago have been ``very erratic,'' Ramon
Aguirre, natural resources deputy in southern Chiapas state, said
by telephone from the state capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez.
	   The showers have lasted only a few hours a day _ not enough to
extinguish all the fires, he said.
	   A team of U.S. forest experts arrived in southern Mexico last
month to help Mexican firefighters gain control of the blazes,
which have endangered rare plant and animal species and spewed a
thick haze of smoke across Mexico and the United States.
	   Forty-one technical assistants from U.S. federal, state and
county agencies were helping the Mexicans set up and use
firefighting helicopters and radio equipment, said Frank Mosbacher,
a spokesman for the Washington Incident Information Center, a U.S.
government office that monitors and reports on fires.
	   The members of the U.S. team were ending their 21-day assignment
and will be replaced by a new set of about 29 experts starting
Tuesday, Mosbacher said.
	   Many of the fires were started by farmers who traditionally
clear land by burning fields. A severe drought, however, had dried
out the typically moist area, making conditions ripe for wildfires.
	   Though the rain is lessening the intensity of the fires and
making it harder for them to spread, ``if it dries out again these
fires can come back to life,'' Mosbacher said.
	   The smoke from the fires raised air pollution fears in Texas in
recent weeks, but researchers say it now poses little threat to the
United States.
	   The U.S. National Weather Service's forecast through Saturday
predicts smoke will continue to drift to the northwest, but says no
visible smoke should be noticed over Texas.
	   A health alert caused by the drifting smoke over Texas was
lifted May 28 when the smoke cleared after about three gloomy
weeks. At its worst, the haze covered much of the Gulf Coast and
Southeast and was apparent as far north as North Dakota.
	   In Mexico, the three regions still troubled by fires in Chiapas
were the Ocote reserve, an area near the municipality of Benito
Juarez, and an area called Pantano near the state's northern border
with Tabasco state, Aguirre said.
	   In the Pantano area, an underground peat fire was proving hard
to locate, Aguirre said.
	   In Oaxaca state, northwest of Chiapas, rain showers have helped
firefighters gain control of most of the fires burning in the rain
forest region of Chimalapas, the government news agency Notimex
cited environment officials as saying.
	   This year, 295 fires have burned in Oaxaca, according to the
report.

Pakistan welcomes U.N. envoy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan wants to send
a special envoy to South Asia to help India and Pakistan resume
their dialogue in the wake of last month's nuclear tests,
Pakistan's U.N. ambassador said Thursday.
	   The U.N. press office had no comment on the statement by the
Pakistani envoy, Ahmad Kamal. But a U.N. spokesman, Hiro Ueki,
noted that Annan had offered several times to help the two
countries resume a dialogue which broke down last year over
Kashmir.
	   ``The secretary-general has decided that he wants to initially
send a personal envoy,'' Kamal told reporters. ``We have welcomed
that immediately. We hope that envoy will come urgently'' perhaps
next week.
	   A spokesman for the Indian mission to the United Nations
declined comment, saying any such announcement should come from
Annan's staff. India has been unenthusiastic to offers of outside
mediation.
	   Kamal spoke to reporters after Pakistan's announcement of a
unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing _ a move that was greeted
by Annan as ``an important step in joining the international norm
of nuclear testing and nonproliferation.''
	   Kamal said Pakistan was taking the step to bring the two
countries ``back from the brink'' of an arms race threatened when
India first detonated a nuclear device last month. Pakistan
followed up with its own testing about two weeks later.
	   Annan met Thursday with ambassadors of the five permanent
Security Council members _ the United States, Russia, Britain,
France and China _ to consider possible steps which could be taken
diplomatically in the wake of the moratorium.
	   Diplomatic sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Annan believes that the permanent members _ who are also nuclear
powers _ should show willingness to fulfill their own promises,
made in 1995, to consider steps to dismantle their own nuclear
arsenals.

World Cup: Polster's late goal gives Austria draw with Cameroon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Optional lead: ADDS more detail, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Austrian coach Herbert Prohaska was
happy with a draw.
	   No wonder. For much of the second half it looked like his squad
_ considered by most to be the long-shot of its group _ was headed
for a loss in its first World Cup game.
	   Younger and faster Cameroon had taken a 1-0 lead in the 77th
minute when Pierre Njanka, making only his third international
appearance, evaded two defenders in a spectacular 40-meter (yard)
run.
	   But Anton Polster saved the day for Austria _ but just barely,
skimming the ball off the bottom of the crossbar after a corner
kick in the last minute of play.
	   ``That we managed to equalize things, that turned into a great
feeling,'' Prohaska said.
	   The victory created a four-way tie on points in World Cup Group
B. The other two teams in the group, Italy and Chile, drew 2-2
earlier in the day.
	   ``We're starting from scratch,'' Prohaska said. ``It was all
zero points before and it's all one point now.''
	   Polster's goal was the 16th goal in World Cup qualifying and
finals matches for the 34-year-old Austrian captain, breaking the
national record held by Hans Krankl.
	   While his goal was dramatic because of its timing, but it paled
in electricity compared to the one netted by World Cup newcomer
Njanka, who started just beyond the midfield line and sidestepped
Wolfgang Feiersinger and then Peter Schoettel before blasting his
shot over diving goalkeeper Michael Konsel.
	   While Austria was content with the draw, Cameroon coach Claude
Leroy was disappointed.
	   ``I cannot be happy after leading for much of the game,'' Leroy
said. ``But c'est la vie _ and that's soccer.''
	   He said his squad would have the day off Friday to spend with
wives and other relatives.
	   ``They've had too much soccer recently,'' he said. ``I don't
want to see them, and they don't want to see me.''
	   Njanka's goal was a one-man effort, characterizing much of
Cameroon's play. It also livened up a game that had featured slips,
slides, pushes and great saves on the wet turf of the new Municipal
Stadium, which was subject to heavy rains just before kickoff.
	   Though the Austrians had possession for much of the first half,
the African squad opened up in the second half, often threatening
but just as often losing out in front of the Austrian goal with
passes that went nowhere.
	   Konsel made three outstanding stops, while Cameroon's Jacques
Sango'o had two tough saves as the match appeared headed for a
scoreless draw.
	   Twice, Konsel leapt to make fingertip saves, against Didier
Angibeau in the first half and against Pierre Wome in the second.
	   Austria didn't test Sango'o until the 71st minute, when he
knocked a shot from Polster to defender Rigobert Song, who cleared
it to the side. Sango'o also held onto an attempt by Heimo
Pfeifenberger in the 74th.
	   The game was marred by rough play, and the Austrians appeared
especially frustrated over several dubious tackles by the
Indomitable Lions. However, Paraguayan referee Epifanio Gonzalez
issued only two yellow cards, one to Pfeffer and the other to
Cameroon's Samuel Ipoua.

Oscarmania runs rampant in El Paso for Saturday night fight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EL PASO, Texas (AP) _ Hundreds of young women shrieked his name
as he arrived at the airport. Hundreds more waited in the desert
heat outside a press conference just to get a glimpse of him.
	   Oscarmania is running rampant in this border city, where Oscar
De La Hoya's title defense against France's Patrick Charpentier is
the biggest thing to hit town since the Rolling Stones a few years
ago.
	   ``Now I know where to come and look for my wife,'' De La Hoya
said Thursday, drawing even more squeals from fans packed in to see
him at a final pre-fight press conference.
	   Some 50,000 people _ the biggest crowd to see a fight in the
United States since Muhammad Ali fought Leon Spinks in the
Superdome 20 years ago _ are expected in the Sun Bowl Saturday
night to watch De La Hoya defend his WBC welterweight title against
the No. 1 contender.
	   They'll be there to see the most popular active fighter today,
whose movie star looks and Mexican-American background draw female
fans who may have never seen a fight before.
	   ``I will never, ever, lose for you guys,'' De La Hoya said to
the teen-age girls screaming his name. ``I will do it for you
guys.''
	   A fight that would draw yawns and a few thousand high-rollers in
Las Vegas is a big hit on the road, where relatively cheap ticket
prices in a heavily Hispanic city guarantee a huge turnout.
	   More than 45,000 tickets were sold by Thursday, and the fight
has dominated media coverage since De La Hoya's arrival two days
earlier before a large crowd gathered at the airport.
	   ``I knew it wasn't going to be a big event if it was in Las
Vegas,'' De La Hoya said.
	   It's a mandatory title defense for De La Hoya, who is drawing
his inspiration not from his almost unknown opponent but from the
reception he figures to get when he enters the ring Saturday night.
	   ``Just by having the event here is what got me motivated,'' De
La Hoya said. ``All the people, all the fans, the arena being sold
out. It's going to be amazing.''
	   The fans are almost certain to leave happy Saturday night,
though they may not be in their seats long for the main event.
	   Charpentier, a straight-ahead grinder who has fought only once
outside of France, appears to be ready-made for the
counter-punching De La Hoya, who is making the fourth defense of
the 147-pound title he won from Pernell Whitaker 14 months ago.
	   ``Charpentier will come out at me and go for the knockout,'' De
La Hoya said. ``He's a short, stocky fighter. He can be dangerous
if I stay in front of him, so I have to pick and move.''
	   De La Hoya, coming off a year in which he fought five times and
made dlrs 33 million, hasn't fought since stopping Wilfredo Rivera
in the eighth round last December. He hurt his left wrist in
training, forcing the fight with Charpentier, which was originally
scheduled for Feb. 28, to be postponed twice.
	   Charpentier has a decent record (27-4-1, 23 knockouts) but has
never fought for a world title. In his only fight outside of
France, he fought to a technical draw Jan. 24, 1997, in Atlantic
City, N.J.
	   De La Hoya, on the other hand, is undefeated in 27 fights with
22 knockouts and has already won titles in four weight classes.
	   ``He's the greatest fighter in the world today,'' promoter Bob
Arum proclaimed.
	   Assuming De La Hoya gets by Charpentier, he is headed toward a
Sept. 18 rematch with Julio Cesar Chavez in Las Vegas. De La Hoya
stopped Chavez in the fourth round on a cut in their first fight
June 7, 1996.
	   Following that, De La Hoya would like to fight IBF welterweight
champion Felix Trinidad or WBA champion Ike Quartey in December.
	   ``I feel rested and re-energized,'' De La Hoya said. ``I'm going
to go out there and stay undefeated.''

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Control of the border
with Haiti has become one of the top priorities in the Dominican
Republic for U.S. officials, who say drug traffickers are crossing
the line too easily.
	   U.S. and Dominican drug agencies estimate that between 10
percent and 15 percent of the cocaine that enters the United States
passes over the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic,
the two nations that share the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.
	   Control of the border was on the agenda when President Clinton
and Dominican President Leonel Fernandez met Wednesday in
Washington. The two countries agreed to joint anti-drug operations
on the border.
	   Clinton said the United States would contribute land, air and
sea forces to the effort, and Fernandez said the Dominican armed
forces would increase their presence on the border.
	   The Dominican press said the United States also agreed to help
the Dominican Republic with the costs of absorbing the thousands of
Dominicans who could be deported by the United States under new
immigration laws.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A woman's mining claim to part of Lima's most
exclusive district has sparked fears among residents of mines amid
their mansions.
	   The news of Lucia Beatriz Velasquez's claim to 500 acres (200
hectares) of the posh district of La Molina stunned municipal
leaders, who have vowed to prevent any mines from being dug in
their neighborhood.
	   The upscale area includes the headquarters of Peru's largest
bank, a massive stadium being built for a popular soccer team, part
of a university and two pre-Incan ruins.
	   ``We will not accept a mine in the heart of La Molina,''
district Vice Mayor Carlos Villacorta said Thursday.
	   Peru's mines claims office awarded mineral rights to the area to
Velasquez in November 1997. But district officials did not become
aware of the claim until she complained to them about municipal
inspectors who had entered her property to check on the
installation of underground pipes.
	   Velasquez could not be reached for comment.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Former Nicaraguan president Daniel
Ortega once studied for the priesthood, his wife has revealed while
defending him from sexual abuse accusations.
	   The announcement by Rosario Murillo's announcement Wednesday
surprised many in Nicaragua, where Ortega had hoped to install a
Marxist-style government like that of Cuba or the former Soviet
Union.
	   Murillo's daughter by a previous marriage, 30-year-old
Zoilamerica Narvaez, has accused Ortega of sexually abusing her for
several years, starting when she was 11.
	   Ortega has not publicly responded to the allegations. Murillo
has denied them, saying her daughter is making the claims for
political reasons.
	   Ortega, leader of the leftist Sandinista National Liberation
Front that overthrew dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979, served as
president from 1979 to 1989.

	   OAXACA CITY, Mexico (AP) _ A Mexican judge has ruled there is
sufficient evidence to hold two men for trial in the rape and
murder of an American artist who was killed while vacationing on
the Pacific Coast, court officials said Thursday.
	   Judge Victoriano Barroso Rojasa ruled that Cirilo Artemio
Olivera Lopez, 35, and Rosendo Marquez Gutierrez, 31, likely were
responsible for the March 29 killing of Carol Jayne Schlosberg of
Chelsea, Vermont.
	   The order was handed down Wednesday and announced by court
officials on Thursday.
	   No trial date was announced.
	   According to court records, the two Oaxaca farm workers admitted
they were drunk and attacked Schlosberg as she walked on a beach
near Puerto Escondido, a popular surfing resort 280 miles (450 kms)
southwest of Mexico City. They admitted raping and sodomizing
Schlosberg, but court records gave no indication of whether they
admitted killing her.
	   The 40-year-old Schlosberg, a former art instructor at Yale
University, had been on vacation in Oaxaca state with her
boyfriend.

Baggio gets redemption, Polster sets record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes from Cameroon-Austria &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Roberto Baggio got redemption and Anton Polster set
a record as each player helped his team salvage a draw, but
Cameroon's Pierre Njanka had the most spectacular goal Thursday on
the second day of the World Cup.
	   Baggio, who missed the penalty kick that ended the World Cup
four years ago, this time found the mark in the 84th minute to lift
Italy to a 2-2 draw with Chile.
	   Polster, making his 91st international appearance, scored off a
corner kick in second-half injury time to give Austria a 1-1 draw
with Cameroon. It was the 16th goal in World Cup qualifying and
finals matches for the 34-year-old captain, breaking the Austrian
record held by Hans Krankl.
	   ``That we managed to equalize things, that turned into a great
feeling,'' Austrian coach Herbert Prohaska said.
	   Polster's goal was dramatic because of its timing, but it paled
in electricity compared to the one netted by World Cup newcomer
Njanka, who evaded two defenders in a brilliant 40-meter (yard) run
to give Cameroon a 1-0 lead in the 77th minute.
	   Making only his third international appearance, Njanka started
just beyond the midfield line, sidestepped Wolfgang Feiersinger and
then Peter Schoettel before blasting his shot over diving
goalkeeper Michael Konsel on the wet turf in Toulouse.
	   The two draws created a four-way tie on points in World Cup
Group B.
	   ``We're starting from scratch,'' Prohaska said. ``It was all
zero points before and it's all one point now.''
	   Earlier, in Bordeaux, Baggio's penalty kick came just as Chile
appeared destined to pull the first major upset of France '98.
	   Baggio, who made all 11 penalty kicks he took in Italian league
play this year and would not have been in starting lineup were it
not for an injury to Alessandro Del Piero, took the penalty after
defender Ronald Fuentes was whistled for a hand ball in the box.
	   ``Certainly I thought of four years ago,'' Baggio said. ``But
then I told myself I was going to put the ball into the net this
time.''
	   ``Luckily I did,'' he added with a smile.
	   Baggio also assisted on Italy's first goal, scored by Christian
Vieri in the 10th minute.
	   Still, the draw marked another slow start for Italy, which fell
1-0 to Ireland in its opener four years ago before rallying to
become the eventual runner-up to Brazil. Baggio took the final shot
in the penalty shootout against Brazil and missed high.
	   ``What happened four years ago doesn't count right now,'' said
Italy's coach, Cesare Maldini. ``I was pleased with the team's
reaction and its thirst for a goal.''
	   In a game played in intermittent downpours and sunshine in
Bordeaux, Marcelo Salas scored in first-half injury time and in the
49th minute for the Chileans, who have been made it past the first
round only once six previous World Cup appearances _ and that was
when they hosted the tournament in 1962.
	   Salas, who will join Italy's Lazio next season in a dlrs 20
million transfer, scored 11 goals in qualifying play _ two less
than the entire Italian team.
	   Later Thursday, Cameroon and Austria played in another Group B
match in Toulouse. Three games are set for Friday: South
Arabia-Denmark in Lens, France-South Africa in Marseille and
Paraguay-Bulgaria in Montpellier.
	   Japan, in the World Cup for the first time, doesn't open play
until Sunday against Argentina, but that's too soon for many
Japanese fans who bought tickets that have failed to materialize.
	   While five Japanese travel agencies reportedly were deciding to
cancel World Cup tours because some 12,000 tickets haven't turned
up, a group of 76 fans already at the team's training camp at
Aix-en-Provence waited to find out if even that much-smaller number
could be met.
	   ``I'm trying to be optimistic,'' said Masami Tachi, a
34-year-old housewife from Tokyo. ``But if we don't get tickets
soon, we're going to take the tour coordinator hostage. We will not
kill him.''
	   At other training camps, injuries were the main concern.
	   Germany lost defensive midfielder Steffen Freund for at least 10
days with a pulled a muscle in his right calf. He'll likely miss
two games.
	   Forward Nwankwo Kanu practiced with Nigeria for the first time
since the Olympic champions arrived in France, although another
striker, Daniel Amokachi, sat out with a twisted right knee.
	   Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp, fighting a hamstring injury, went
through a full _ though not very strenuous _ training session and
emerged hopeful of playing Saturday against the Belgians.
	   Spying also became an issue Thursday, with Spanish coach Javier
Clemente venting anger after some photographers attempted to enter
a closed practice session.
	   And Croatia was upset when its own spies were sent away from an
open practice held by Jamaica, its first World Cup opponent.
Croatian soccer federation president Branko Miksa said tournament
rules say no one can be barred from an open practice, not even
officials from other teams.
	   ``We don't want to make a big noise about this, but we will send
a protest to FIFA and the organizing committee,'' he said.
	   And, in a court in Paris, a Scottish soccer fan was sentenced to
a two-month suspended sentence for throwing beer cans at a French
policeman after Tuesday night's pre-Cup parade.
	   Christopher Kyles, 23, of Aberdeen, apologized to the court,
admitted being drunk and said he remembered none of his actions.

Five killed in chain-collision near Montreal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ A truck-car pileup killed five people and
injured at least three Thursday near Montreal.
	   Tractor-trailer trucks and cars were shoved into each other in a
chain reaction collision on Highway 40, one of the major arteries
leading off the island of Montreal.
	   The crash occurred when a tanker truck loaded with milk was
approaching a traffic jam and collided with another vehicle.
	   Two cars were caught in the truck's undercarriage and were
dragged into the ditch with it, exploding after they crashed off
the road, police said.
	   The accident forced the closure of parts of the highway, which
runs along the north shore of the St. Lawrence River.

Direct humanitarian flights resume between United States and Cuba
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Direct humanitarian aid from the United States
resumed for the first time in two years on Thursday when a
chartered plane arrived in Havana carrying about dlrs 800,000 worth
of medicines and medical supplies.
	   The DC-6 propeller plane, chartered by Catholic Relief Services,
touched down in the Cuban capital following a 1 1/2-hour flight
from the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.
	   ``Today we have a historic step, which is the resumption of
direct humanitarian flights,'' said Thomas Wenski, auxiliary bishop
of the Archdiocese of Miami. Wenski, who did not go on the flight,
spoke at a news conference in Florida before the takeoff.
	   Wenski said the direct flight and others like it in the future
would help the Roman Catholic Church cut the cost of shipping aid
to Cuba. In the past two years, aid has had to be shipped through
indirect flights or by land to Canada, and then by boat to Cuba.
That can cost four times what it costs to fly directly.
	   Direct charity flights to the communist nation were halted in
1996 after Cuban planes shot down two unarmed U.S. planes. Four
members of Brothers to the Rescue, a Cuban exile group based in
Miami, were killed.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton lifted the ban after Pope John Paul
II visited Cuba in January. During that visit, the pope asked that
the world open itself to Cuba and Cuba open itself to the world.
	   By sending an aid flight Thursday, Wenski said, ``we are
basically putting the human above political considerations.''
	   The cargo will be distributed by Caritas Cuba, the Catholic
Church's relief arm here.

British Columbia to charge tobacco companies a fee to sell
</HEADLINE>
cigarettes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) _ British Columbia escalated its
war against tobacco companies Thursday, becoming the first Canadian
province to propose a license fee for the right to sell cigarettes,
	   The move is expected to generate about dlrs 20 million (dlrs 14
million U.S.) to pay for anti-smoking programs.
	   The province's health minister, Penny Priddy, said she expects
the tobacco industry to fight the proposed legislation.
	   Canada's tobacco companies said they were studying the proposal,
but their initial response was to call it a disguised tax increase.
	   ``This is just another veiled tax on a consumer product,'' said
John McDonald, a spokesman for Rothmans, Benson and Hedges Inc.
	   Imperial Tobacco Ltd., Canada's largest tobacco company, said it
is studying the legality of the licensing fees and would take the
B.C. government to court if it concluded the fees were illegal.

Sutherland leads Els-less Buick Classic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOEL STASHENKO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARRISON, New York (AP) _ Kevin Sutherland shot an opening-round
64 Thursday to finish two strokes in front of a Buick Classic field
which lost two-time defending champion Ernie Els to a bad back.
	   A back spasm which Els said hit him Wednesday night forced his
withdrawal as he played his ninth hole of Thursday's round. The
South African called his status for next week's U.S. Open, in which
he is also defending champion, a ``day-to-day thing.''
	   Even if Els was healthy, he would have been hard-pressed to
match shots Thursday with Sutherland, especially during a
sensational back nine on the Westchester Country Club course when
Sutherland shot a 6-under 29. Sutherland chipped in twice from off
the green, for a birdie on No. 12 and an eagle at No. 18, and made
birdie putts on Nos. 10, 15 and 17.
	   Sutherland tied the record for lowest nine-hole score at
Westchester shared by Willie Wood (1990) and Kirk Triplett (1982).
	   Sutherland's 7-under score led Steve Lowery, Paul Goydos, Bob
Tway and J.P. Hayes by two shots. Tom Lehman and Mark Calcavecchia
were a stroke further back with 67s and Jeff Maggert, runnerup to
Els last year, was among those at 68.
	   Almost all the low scorers played in the morning. A swirling,
chilly wind pushed the scores of most afternoon starters above par.
	   An exception was Goydos, whose round was highlighted by a
eagle-2 on the par-4 seventh hole. His wedge shot nicked the flag,
landed about five feet (1.5 meters) past the pin and spun back into
the hole.
	   Sutherland credited his strong round to a simple adjustment _
stepping back from the ball a bit and flattening the arc of his
swing.
	   ``I needed to swing more around myself, to move away from the
ball,'' he said. ``I was really getting upright.''
	   Sutherland said he also likes playing on older courses like the
par-71, Westchester Country Club layout.
	   ``I'm not a huge fan of the modern courses where they kind of
take a bulldozer in and build something,'' he said. ``I don't mind
blind tee shots. I like the way this golf course kind of flows
through the trees. The greens are very subtle and they're tough to
putt.''
	   Lowery said a mental, not a physical, adjustment led to a
six-birdie, one-bogey round. Recent deaths in the family and the
birth of his son in January created distractions that harmed his
concentration and sense of purpose, according to Lowery.
	   ``I've been kind of lackadaisical,'' he said. ``I've been going
through the motions. ... I don't know why complacency comes.''
	   On Thursday, Lowery said he felt some of his old aggressiveness.
	   ``I took it to the golf course instead of letting the golf
course take it to me,'' he said.
	   Els' injury wasn't far from the minds of the leaders, especially
considering he was the wire-to-wire winner in the last two Buick
Classics. Most said they weren't conceding anything to Els, the No.
1-ranked player in the world, before he withdrew from the
tournament Thursday.
	   ``This wasn't the Ernie Els benefit by any means,'' Lehman said.
	   But eliminating a player of Els' stature from the picture does
simplify things, Lehman said.
	   ``With him out of the field, that's one great player with a
great track record that you don't have to worry about,'' Lehman
said. ``I don't mean to sound callous. But any time you have a guy
who's had as much success on this course and he's not playing, your
chances improve.''

History is against Jazz
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICK GANO &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ No team has ever rallied from 3-1 down in the
National Basketball Association Finals to win a championship. The
Utah Jazz still believe they can be the first.
	   But first they have to take care of Friday's Game 5. Find a way
to score and win at the United Center.
	   ``It's not a good position to be in but I don't feel it's
frustrating,'' John Stockton said. ``If we win, that's a different
situation. We'll be going home for two.
	   ``I'm not happy where we are, but with one win can we can change
the complexion and we can go back to our house and finish it off
ourselves.''
	   Strangely, Michael Jordan likened the Bulls' position to a meal.
	   ``I don't want to jump ahead of myself. Tonight was like an
appetizer, Friday could be the entree,'' Jordan said.
	   ``We can't fill ourselves up with just the appetizer. The job is
not done. We can taste it but we still have to finish the job.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; WHO'S THE MVP: Michael Jordan has been the MVP of the finals in
all five of his previous trips.
	   Scottie Pippen hasn't scored as many points but his defense has
been a key as the Bulls captured three of the first four games.
	   Bulls coach Phil Jackson admitted it would be a tough choice.
	   ``That's your call, not mine guys,'' Jackson told reporters.
``From my situation it would be difficult who would merit it. I
would say it's between Michael and Scottie and you got a real tough
choice.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; NUMBERS: Michael Jordan became the leader in field goal
attempts in NBA playoff history. Jordan attempted 27 shots and
moved past Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (4,422). Jordan has attempted 4,436
shots. ... The Bulls were 17-of-24 from the line in the fourth
quarter Wednesday to only 2-of-3 for the Jazz. ... Jordan has
scored at least 20 points in a finals-record 33 straight games.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BEST QUESTION: Dennis Rodman's defense on Karl Malone, his
rebounding and his clutch free throws were all part of the Chicago
Bulls' victory Wednesday night.
	   So what did a lot of people want to know?
	   Will Rodman show up for practice Thursday?
	   ``That's the dlrs 10,000 question right there,'' Bulls coach
Phil Jackson said. ``I expect Dennis to be here tomorrow with bells
on. We won't do much practicing.''
	   Rodman skipped a practice this week and ended up at a wrestling
show in Detroit.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DON''T WANNA GO: Leave it to Dennis Rodman to worry about his
social life should the NBA Finals return to Utah. The Jazz,
trailing 3-1, would have to win Friday night for that to happen.
	   ``I don't want to go back,'' Rodman said.
	   ``My life just goes to complete hell when I go to Utah. That
means I have to revert to going back to Las Vegas or going
somewhere to get some excitement, to keep my mind rolling.''
	   After the Bulls lost Game 1, Rodman hopped on a plane and went
to Las Vegas for an early morning of gambling. This week he skipped
practice and ended up in Detroit at a wrestling show.
	   The Worm does get around.
	   ``We need to concentrate and not fly there,'' Rodman said of
Utah. Last year, he was fined dlrs 50,000 for his derogatory
comments about Mormons during the NBA Finals.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; READY TO PARTY: The city of Chicago has already scheduled its
championship rally should the Bulls win a sixth title.
	   Win the next game and the Bulls would appear at downtown Grant
Park on Monday. If the Bulls clinch in Sunday's sixth game, the
rally would be Tuesday. If it goes seven and the Bulls win, the
rally is set for Friday, June 19.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; OPEN YOUR WALLET: Ticket brokers say prices for Wednesday
night's Game 4 ranged from dlrs 350 to dlrs 550 for cheap seats to
dlrs 9,000 for courtside. Pushing the prices up is the possibility
Michael Jordan is playing his final games in Chicago.
	   That's why seats are projected to cost even more for Friday's
Game 5.

Bulls prepare for what might be their final game together
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Nobody was certain of the answer Thursday as the
world pondered the question: Will this be the final game for the
dynasty known as the Chicago Bulls?
	   ``It's going to be hard not to think of it that way,'' Michael
Jordan said as the drama surrounding this strangest of sports
success stories moved toward what could be its most rousing
chapter.
	   Holding a 3-1 lead over the Utah Jazz in the National Basketball
Association Finals, the Bulls will have a chance Friday night to
win their sixth championship this decade, extending a run of
dominance not seen since the days of Bill Russell and the Boston
Celtics.
	   The Bulls yearned to finish the job on their own terms.
	   ``We'd love to get this thing done here, in Chicago, in front of
the fans,'' Jordan said. ``If this so happens to be the last dance,
why not do it in front of the fans.''
	   If the Bulls win, there's no telling how long it will take for
the breakup question to be answered.
	   Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Luc Longley and Steve
Kerr are among the team's free agents, and coach Phil Jackson does
not have a contract for next season, either.
	   Owner Jerry Reinsdorf and general manager Jerry Krause have been
silent on the issue during the finals.
	   ``I think (Jordan) will know sometime in August or September
when the thirst or the hunger to come back is not there or is
there,'' Jackson said. ``I'm the same as anybody else. It's going
to take me a while to step back and look at this and make a
decision one way or the other about what's going to happen.''
	   Jackson's mood of reflection and reminiscence was typical of the
emotional state of mind at the United Center. Jud Buechler had a
distant look in his eyes as he spoke about the luxury of playing
with Jordan, saying he'll be thinking about the end of a era when
he drives to work Friday night.
	   Bill Wennington used the sad analogy of the end of a family's
life together.
	   Ron Harper played his usual role of team jester, injecting a bit
of humor into the mix as he has done throughout this tumultuous
season.
	   Pippen, meanwhile, flip-flopped again on his plans, backing off
comments from earlier in the week.
	   ``I don't have any intention of coming back here next season _
even though I stated a couple days ago that I would look to come
back,'' Pippen said. ``I think this is the last run for this
ballclub.''
	   If so, it has been a run unmatched by any professional sports
franchise in decades. The Bulls' five championship seasons have
included victories over Magic Johnson's Lakers, Charles Barkley's
Suns, Clyde Drexler's Trail Blazers and Gary Payton's SuperSonics.
And now it's looking like a second straight victory over Karl
Malone and John Stockton's Utah Jazz.
	   The Bulls have shown themselves to be defensive geniuses in this
series, frustrating the best shooting team in the league. Chicago
has turned the Jazz into an inept shell of their former selves
while finding ways to win despite shooting around 40 percent.
	   ``If we had executed in Game 1, this would have been a sweep,''
Jordan said.
	   The Jazz, meanwhile, went about their business Thursday. After
all, they have their own problems.
	   The Jazz refused to complain about the officiating and vowed to
stick with their offensive schemes _ even if it leads to another
no-show fourth quarter for Malone.
	   Last year's MVP has failed to carry his team in this series,
leading many to dismiss him as a softie and a failure.
	   He said he would remind his younger teammates not to be
quitters, that gaining one more victory would send the series back
to the Jazz's comfort zone of Salt Lake City.
	   ``Don't be making summer plans. This thing ain't over yet,''
Malone said.
	   Utah faces a daunting task in trying to win the series. No team
has ever come back from a 3-1 deficit in the finals, and the Bulls
haven't lost three straight games with Jordan on the team since the
start of the 1990-91 season.

Zapatista uniforms fill southern Mexican village after army raid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from government negotiator. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN RICE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHAVAJEVAL, Mexico (AP) _ The police and soldiers were gone from
this Indian village on Thursday, and dozens men in Zapatista rebel
uniforms patrolled the town's square, some with assault rifles.
	   The evidence of a clash between the army and rebels Wednesday
was everywhere _ smashed desks in the farm hall, the ransacked
interior of the town store, an ample smearing of blood on the
concrete floor of the health clinic.
	   Although the government has said its troops were fired upon as
they entered the village, residents said Thursday that the army
rolled in shooting tear gas and mortars, and that only then
residents responded with gunfire.
	   Nine people were killed _ including one policeman _ up to nine
were injured and 52 were arrested before the troops withdrew
Wednesday afternoon. It was among the deadliest clashes since the
rebels' January 1994 uprising for Indian rights and greater
democracy.
	   Some villagers said the army chased residents into the lush
green hills surrounding the village. No women or children could be
seen here on Thursday.
	   ``All the government gives us is gunshots,'' said a man dressed
in a Zapatista uniform and carrying a rifle, who gave his name as
Adolfo Lopez Mateos _ the name of a former Mexican president.
	   He, like the other uniformed men, would not identify themselves
as Zapatistas _ or say who they were at all. ``There's no uniform
here,'' Lopez Mateos said, like the others wearing the rebels'
typical dark brown shirt, charcoal gray pants and sturdy hiking
boots, a blue ski mask tucked into his belt.
	   Some of the men carried AK-47s; others smaller rifles. Some
carried mock weapons made of wood, of the type that Zapatistas use
to train recruits.
	   Wednesday's clash, which killed nine people, appears to have
been the first direct confrontation between government forces and
Zapatista rebels in years, and some analysts said it could signal a
new willingness by the government to use force to crush rebel
support.
	   ``Since public opinion is in favor of negotiating an end to the
Chiapas conflict, the government has decided to use force without
saying so,'' said Lorenzo Meyer, a prominent academic in Mexico
City. ``It's what you call in English a `trial balloon.' If the
Mexican people don't react strongly, the government will
continue.''
	   Emilio Rabasa Gamboa, the government's chief negotiator,
stressed Thursday that the raid on Chavajeval in no way signifies a
breaking of the truce in Chiapas.
	   Rabasa, speaking after a meeting with Interior Secretary
Francisco Labastida Ochoa in Mexico City, said that rather than
begin dialogue with the government, the Zapatista rebels had chosen
to maintain a silence ``which I believe has a high cost.''

	   EAST LANSING, Michigan (AP) _ Donna Andrews, who has finished
second in the last three LPGA Tour events, birdied 10 of the first
13 holes Thursday before settling for an 8-under-par 64 and a
two-stroke lead in the first round of the dlrs 650,000 Oldsmobile
Classic.
	   Val Skinner and Australian Karrie Webb shots 66s and Dina
Ammaccapane, Dottie Pepper, Wendy Ward, Lisa Walters and Jenny
Lidback had 67s.
	   The Oldsmobile Classic's defending champion, Pat Hurst, was four
back at 68.
	   Andrews, 31, the LPGA money leader, birdied five straight holes
on the front nine of the Walnut Hills Country Club course.
	   ``I don't think I was alone the first 13 holes; someone upstairs
was playing those holes with me,'' Andrews said. ``I just got all
the good bounces today.''
	   Andrews said an improved putting stroke is responsible for her
success this season.
	   ``It seemed like every time I stood over the ball it went in,''
Andrews said. ``We were laughing out there because it seemed like I
couldn't miss. We probably were laughing and carrying on too much
because I lost focus.''
	   Her string of birdies was followed by consecutive bogeys on Nos.
14 and 15, both par-5s.
	   ``I had two par-5s coming up that I knew were birdie holes,''
Andrews said. ``I wasn't playing safe and I got a little too
aggressive. On both of my bogeys I had makeable putts for pars and
I just didn't do it.''
	   Andrews, who won the Longs Drugs Challenge in early April, has
won six times on the tour, including three times in 1994.
	   Webb, who played in the same group as Andrews, birdied five of
her first nine holes.
	   ``This is the best I have hit it in a while,'' the 23-year-old
Australian said. ``I have been hitting the greens, but not real
close. Today I finally played solid.''
	   Skinner opened her first round with birdies on six of the first
10 holes. She bogeyed the par-4 12th hole but made a putt for a
birdie on the final hole.

 &UR; CUBA: First direct aid from from U.S. to Cuba in two years takes
off &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Direct humanitarian aid from the United States
resumed for the first time in two years on Thursday when a
chartered plane arrived in Havana carrying about dlrs 800,000 worth
of medicines and medical supplies.
	   The DC-6 propeller plane, chartered by Catholic Relief Services,
touched down in the Cuban capital following a 1 1/2-hour flight
from the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.
	   Thomas Wenski, auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Miami,
said the direct flight and others like it in the future would help
the Roman Catholic Church cut the cost of shipping aid to Cuba.
	   Direct charity flights to the communist nation were halted in
1996 after Cuban planes shot down two unarmed U.S. planes. Four
members of Brothers to the Rescue, a Cuban exile group based in
Miami, were killed.
 &UR; NETHERLANDS ANTILLES: Small countries cannot afford Coast Guard
	   WILLEMSTAD, Curacao (AP) _ The new prime minister of the
Netherlands Antilles said larger countries should do more to patrol
Caribbean waters so her islands can spend scarce resources to
control crime on land.
	   In comments this week after being sworn into office, Prime
Minister Suzy Camelia-Romer said the five islands of the
Netherlands Antilles cannot afford the expense of an extensive
coast guard.
	   ``We are just five small islands with no more than 200,000
persons living on them,'' said Camelia-Romer. ``How can the United
States, Britain, France and Holland expect us to invest millions of
dollars in our Coast Guard while criminality on our islands is on
the rise?''
	   She said those major countries should bear more of the burden of
patrolling the waters around the Netherlands Antilles, which
consists of the islands of Curacao and Bonaire, just off the coast
of South America, and St. Maarten, St. Eustatious and Saba in the
eastern Caribbean.
 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Haitian border is discussed in White House
meeting
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Control of the border
with Haiti has become one of the top priorities in the Dominican
Republic for U.S. officials, who say drug traffickers are crossing
the line too easily.
	   U.S. and Dominican anti-drug agencies estimate that between 10
percent and 15 percent of the cocaine that enters the United States
crosses the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, the
two nations that share the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.
	   Control of the border was on the agenda when U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Dominican President Leonel Fernandez met Wednesday in
Washington. The two countries agreed to joint anti-drug operations
on the border.
	   Clinton said the United States would contribute land, air and
sea forces to the effort, and Fernandez said the Dominican armed
forces would increase their presence on the border.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Ten tons of trash removed from National Park
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Some 200 volunteers collected more
than 10 tons of trash in a cleanup day at El Yunque rainforest
reserve Saturday, the U.S. Forest Service said.
	   In a press release issued Thursday, the Forest Service said the
garbage was collected by organizations and individuals, as well as
municipal personnel from the towns around El Yunque, officially
known as the Caribbean National Forest.
	   Most of the trash was collected along the rivers and roads in
the park.
	   ``We urge the citizens not to use these areas as dumps,'' the
Forest Service said in the statement. ``This can influence the
deterioration of our bodies of water and increase pollution.''
	   El Yunque is the only tropical rainforest in the U.S. National
Parks system and is visited by more than 30,000 people each year.
 &UR; MARTINIQUE: Shooting victim dies
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ A man shot in the head in a
restaurant by a gang of masked men has died, the newspaper France
Antilles reported Thursday.
	   Philippe Blanc, 41, was in a restaurant in the southern town of
Ducos at 11:30 p.m. Tuesday when three armed men burst in and
demanded money. Blanc was shot in the head and later died from his
wounds, the newspaper reported.
	   Witnesses said the three men fled without taking a cash after
firing several shots.
	   The victim was married and the father of a 3-year-old boy.
 &UR; GUYANA: Rights group asks Guyana not to hang two convicts
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ A London-based human rights group said
Thursday it plans to petition the Guyana government to commute the
death sentences of two prisoners who have been on death row for
more than 10 years.
	   The group, Interrights, said it would lobby President Janet
Jagan in the wake of a recommendation last month by the United
Nations Human Rights Committee that Abdool Yaseen and Noel Thomas
be set free.
	   The two were convicted more than a decade ago for killing
Yaseen's younger brother in a dispute over family assets.
Interrights contends the long time the two have spent on death row
constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and it also questioned
some aspects of their trial.
	   The government has said it will ignore the U.N. rights group's
recommendation and pressure from human rights groups and proceed
with the hangings in the next few weeks.
	   In a meeting of justice ministers from Caribbean countries last
week, several complained that human rights groups were ganging up
on them and pressuring them to halt executions.
 &UR; VIRGIN ISLANDS: Public library archives closed
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ It can't find a
qualified librarian, much of its collection of historic documents
remains in boxes and even some of the shelves have been stolen.
	   Facing those troubles, officials at the Enid Baa Library have
closed the Van Scholten Collection of archives to the public and do
not know when it will be open again. The library itself is
operating on a part-time schedule without a librarian.
	   Housed in a historic building in downtown Charlotte Amalie, Baa
Library is the only library serving St. Thomas' 50,000 people. It
also serves the public school system through a computerized
information system and assists hundreds of secondary and college
students.
 &UR; CANADA: Company buys Barbados resort, other hotels
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Canadian Pacific Hotels said Thursday it will buy
seven resort hotels, with more than 3,000 rooms, in Arizona,
Bermuda, Mexico and Barbados.
	   CP Hotels, a unit of Canadian Pacific Ltd. of Montreal, will pay
dlrs 540 million for the Princess Hotels, owned by Lonrho PLC.
	   After the acquisition, Canadian Pacific Hotels will own 18
resort hotels with more than 8,000 rooms.
	   It is already the largest hotel operator in Canada with 21,000
rooms, under the brands Canadian Pacific Hotels and Delta Hotels.
	   The properties to be purchased include the Scottsdale Princess
in Scottsdale, Arizona; two hotels in Bermuda; two in Acapulco,
Mexico; and two in Barbados.

Wilson is California dreamin' in Stanley Cup finals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN RAPPOPORT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Hockey Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Ron Wilson has had to make some personal
sacrifices since taking over as coach of the Washington Capitals,
most notably living apart from his family in California.
	   Thursday was an important day in his life in more ways than one.
Not only was his team meeting Detroit in the second game of the
Stanley Cup finals, but he was missing his daughter's high school
graduation.
	   ``I spoke to her today,'' Wilson said of his daughter, Lauren.
	   ``I asked her if she wouldn't mind having ``Go, Caps, Go''
printed on her forehead when she walked up to the stage,'' he
quipped.
	   The graduation ceremony took place at a suburban high school
near Anaheim, where Wilson coached for four years before coming to
Washington this season.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; RISKY BUSINESS: &LR;  The Detroit Red Wings suffered an injury at
practice this week, although it won't affect their lineup.
Associate coach Barry Smith suffered a shoulder separation when he
stepped on a puck with his skate near the boards and fell.
	   After seeing team trainer John Wharton, Smith was apparently put
right.
	   ``He's 100 percent and ready to go,'' a Capitals spokesman said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; STAY AWAY FROM HIS DOOR: &LR;  The top prospects for the NHL draft
in Buffalo later this month attended a Stanley Cup luncheon
Thursday and got a veiled warning from Brian Burke, the league's
director of hockey operations.
	   ``Good luck in the future _ and make sure you don't make it to
my office.''
	   As one his duties, Burke is in charge of disciplining players.
	   Eight players showed for the luncheon, including projected No. 1
pick Vincent Lecavalier of the Rimouski Oceanic of the Quebec Major
Junior Hockey League.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DON'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU READ: &LR;  How does Scotty Bowman prepare
his team to play in the finals, considering all the favorable press
picking the Red Wings as overwhelming favorites?
	   ``We keep telling the players that the people who picked them
don't know what they're talking about,'' Bowman said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; LOCAL PRIDE: &LR;  If Detroit is ``Hockeytown,'' then what is
Washington? Capitals coach Ron Wilson was asked that at a news
conference Thursday and he sounded like a spokesman for the Chamber
of Commerce.
	   ``Washington is the best place to live in the East,'' said
Wilson, who spent the first four years of his NHL coaching career
at Anaheim. ``A recent poll said that. It might not be
`Hockeytown,' but there are so many things to do there.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; STILL RUSHIN': &LR;  What makes Viacheslav Fetisov one of the best
defensemen in hockey history?
	   ``He's good in a puck-control situation,'' Red Wings general
manager Ken Holland says. ``He makes a very good first pass. He's
also mentally tough and physically strong.''
	   Fetisov, the former star of the powerful Russian Red Army team,
is a rarity, playing professional hockey at the age of 40. He is
only the fifth 40-year-old player since the NHL's expansion era to
appear in a Stanley Cup final.
	   ``He's been there every night for us,'' Holland said. ``He is
very proud and a determined athlete who gets the most out of his
ability every night.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; TIMING IS EVERYTHING: &LR;  How important is it scoring the first
goal in the Stanley Cup playoffs? Very _ as far as the Detroit Red
Wings and Washington Capitals are concerned.
	   When the Red Wings beat the Capitals 2-1 in Game 1 of the finals
Tuesday night, it improved their record to 10-1 when scoring first.
The Capitals dropped to 3-5 when allowing the first goal.
	   Prior to Thursday night's Game 2, the Capitals were 9-1 when
scoring first.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; EXPERIENCING THE FINALS: &LR;  Experience means everything, as far
as officials in the Stanley Cup finals are concerned. The seven
officials on the ice for this year's finals have logged a combined
10,753 regular-season and playoff games.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; THAT'S EATING: &LR;  If nothing else, the Capitals will be eating
well during this year's finals. They have brought their own chef
along for the games in Detroit.
	   Chef Gennaro Ferrigno, executive chef for the That's Amore
restaurant chain of Washington, came along to provide special
cuisine for the Eastern Conference champions.
	   Ferrigno has been cooking for the team for most home games at
the MCI Center and also recently started to provide meal service
for the team's charter flights.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; THEY GOT 'EM COVERED: &LR;  Getting around these days? You can still
catch the Stanley Cup finals in many places of the world, no matter
how distant.
	   The NHL says the finals are being broadcast live to more than
170 countries, a record. That includes Asia and the Pacific Rim,
the Middle East, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Northern
Africa and Africa.

Government denies New Zealand heading for recession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, Australia (AP) _ Finance Minister Bill Birch said
Friday that the New Zealand economy was not sliding towards
recession, despite a report forecasting growth will continue to
slow.
	   The Pacific Economic Cooperation Council report on the Pacific
region says growth in New Zealand will slow from 4 percent in 1997
to between 1 percent and 2 percent in 1998.
	   While the easing will be offset by growing household spending,
leaving economic growth static at around 2.1 percent in 1998, the
slower growth will have a significant impact on exporters, the
report said.
	   The report's authors believe most economies in the region would
begin to pick up in late 1998, and New Zealand's growth is forecast
to improve to 2.9 percent in 1999.
	   The report caps off a week that has seen the New Zealand dollar
fall to a 12-year low of below U.S. 50 cents and U.S. dlrs 615
million (New Zealand dollars 1.23 billion) wiped off the value of
shares as the stock market slumped to its lowest point in more than
two years.
	   Birch said growth in the next 12 months would be flatter than
had been anticipated a year ago but added that the report mirrored
government's expectations, including forecasts for strong growth in
1999 and 2000.
	   ``The profile for the economy over the next two or three years
is not dissimilar to the official forecasts contained in the
budget,'' Birch said. Asked if the economy was sliding towards a
recession, Birch answered ``no.''

Philippines marks centennial of declaration of independence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with start of celebrations

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Church bells pealed and flags were
raised nationwide Friday as Filipinos celebrated the centennial of
their country's declaration of independence from Spain, the climax
of Asia's first revolution against Western colonial rule.
	   President Fidel Ramos hailed the Philippines' achievement of
relative peace and stability just 12 years after the ouster of the
late dictator Ferdinand Marcos and a decade after a series of coup
attempts.
	   ``Most important of all is that we reached our 100th year not in
a state of war, not in a state of massive insurgency, not with
coups happening all over the place,'' said Ramos, whose term ends
June 30.
	   More than 30 countries sent representatives to the main
celebrations at Manila's Rizal Park, named after national hero Jose
Rizal who was shot by the Spanish for advocating equality.
	   The festivities also included a parade depicting the country's
struggle against 333 years of Spanish colonialism and a massive
fireworks display Friday night over Manila Bay.
	   Leftist groups under the New Patriotic Alliance, however,
planned an ``alternative'' celebration with a protest parade to the
U.S. Embassy.
	   Leaders of the alliance said they are celebrating the demise of
Spain's colonial rule in 1898 but also highlighting the United
States' subsequent takeover of the Philippines, which they claim is
downplayed in the government-sponsored festivities.
	   The Philippine government, helped by private companies, spent at
least 3.5 billion pesos (dlrs 92 million) on the centennial
celebrations, which also feature a trade and historical exposition
at the Clark Special Economic Zone, a former U.S. air base in
northern Pampanga province.
	   A third of the money went to the renovation of 16 historic
shrines and the construction of historical markers and monuments
along the ``freedom trail,'' sites where Filipinos put up
resistance against Spain.
	   Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan was the first European to
land in the Philippines on a mission to search for spices for Spain
in 1521. The archipelago formally became a Spanish colony in 1565.
	   Sporadic local revolts challenged the Spanish colonial
administration. In 1892, Filipino nationalists established a secret
society called the Katipunan, which prepared for armed rebellion
against Spain.
	   The revolt erupted four years later and spread rapidly through
much of the country.
	   On June 12, 1898, revolutionary leader Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo
proclaimed independence from Spain in Kawit in Cavite province
south of Manila.
	   A month earlier the Spanish armada had been destroyed in Manila
Bay by U.S. naval forces under Commodore George Dewey, who was sent
to the Philippines following the outbreak of the Spanish-American
war a few months earlier.
	   Spain, still unwilling to hand over power to the Filipino
revolutionaries, ceded the country to the United States for dlrs 20
million in December 1898.
	   The following year, hostilities broke out between Filipino
revolutionaries and American forces sent to occupy the new U.S.
colony. The brief but brutal Philippine-American war is considered
by some historians as the ``first Vietnam'' of the United States.
	   The U.S. colonial administration was interrupted by Japanese
occupation during World War II.
	   The United States formally granted the Philippines independence
in 1946, but American influence remains strong.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO decided Thursday to use military
preparations, including simulated air strikes, to send a strong
message to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that he should
cease his crackdown on separatist Kosovo. U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen and his 15 NATO colleagues approved a package of
measures they hoped would persuade Milosevic to pull back his
Serb-led army and police forces in the province. Yugoslavia, which
said it opposed the NATO decisions, has been carrying out
escalating attacks on the ethnic-Albanian majority.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Answering a storm of criticism, President Bill
Clinton defended his coming trip to China as ``the best way to make
a difference'' for human rights, democracy and world peace. He
turned aside objections to his planned appearance at Tiananmen
Square. Clinton said his welcoming ceremony at the edge of the
infamous square in Beijing would not absolve the government of
responsibility for the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy
demonstrators. Sooner or later, China's leaders must recognize that
``what the government did was wrong,'' Clinton said in a speech
Thursday. Two weeks before arriving in China as the first U.S.
president since the bloodshed, Clinton said: ``I'm going because I
think it's the right thing to do for our country.''
(US-CLINTON-CHINA)
	   CHAVAJEVAL, Mexico (AP) _ Soldiers were gone from this Indian
village Thursday, but evidence of a clash between the army and
rebels was everywhere. Dozens of men in Zapatista rebel uniforms
patrolled the town's square, some with assault rifles. Although the
government has said its troops were fired upon as they entered the
village Wednesday, residents said that the army rolled in shooting
tear gas and mortars, and that only then residents responded with
gunfire. Nine people were killed in the clash, one of the deadliest
since the rebels' January 1994 uprising for Indian rights and
greater democracy. (MEXICO-CHIAPAS)
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Determined to end decades of oppression,
Nigeria's opposition defiantly planned mass demonstrations for
Friday, handing the country's new military ruler his first major
challenge. Critics at home and abroad were watching to see whether
Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar would show uncommon tolerance _ or crush
his opponents in the brutal tradition of predecessor, the late Gen.
Sani Abacha. Military officials indicated there Thursday would be
no change in their policies. Abubakar became the country's latest
military leader this week following Abacha's death from a heart
attack. (NIGERIA)
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Fighting between renegade soldiers and
government troops raged in the capital of Guinea-Bissau on Thursday
while foreigners were evacuated by ship from the West African
nation. A Portuguese merchant ship docked in Bissau left for Dakar
in neighboring Senegal with between 1,500 and 2,000 foreigners on
board, Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said. The
evacuees were mostly Portuguese but also included 20 other
nationalities, Guterres told a news conference. The city's airport
has been closed since Sunday, when an unknown number of rebels led
by former armed forces chief Brig. Gen. Ansumane Mane launched a
coup attempt. Guinea-Bissau, a former Portuguese colony, has a
population of about 1 million. (GUINEA-BISSAU)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow Jones industrial average plunged nearly
160 points Thursday as a soaring dollar compounded concerns about
weakening trade with Asia for U.S. companies. The Dow fell 159.93
to 8,811.77 and has now lost more than 250 points in the past three
sessions, essentially wiping out the rally of the three sessions
before that. Broader stock indicators also suffered heavy losses
despite another strong day in the bond market, where long-term
interest rates eased to an all-time low of 5.65 percent. The dollar
soared Thursday to its highest level against the yen in nearly
eight years after Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin appeared to rule
out a U.S. role in supporting the Japanese currency. Even before
Rubin's report to a Senate panel, many Asian markets had already
plunged after Wednesday's meeting of the Group of Seven
industrialized nations failed to produce any statement or plan of
support for the yen. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin expressed
heightened concerns about Japan's inability to fix its broken
economy in remarks that sent the Japanese currency skidding to the
lowest level in nearly eight years against the U.S. dollar. ``The
Japanese economy still fails to show signs of recovery and Japan's
economic difficulties and weak currency are having substantial
adverse impact on the East Asian countries,'' Rubin told a
congressional committee Thursday. He noted that the administration
had been pressing Japan for more than a year to take more forceful
actions to get the world's second largest economy growing again.
Rubin called intervention ``a temporary tool, not a fundamental
solution. (US-FOREIGN TRADE)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund wants Russia to
adopt a strict austerity plan in exchange for billions of dollars
in new loans, a top Western banking official said Thursday. It's
not clear precisely what the IMF is offering, however, or whether
Russia is willing or able to agree to the deal. The official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said the IMF demands included
slashing the budget deficit, passing a tax reform package, breaking
up the Gazprom energy monopoly and being more open about statistics
and fiscal activities. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Mitsubishi Motors has agreed to pay dlrs 34
million to settle charges that it ignored widespread sexual
harassment of female factory workers, a move the U.S government
said Thursday serves notice to corporate America that such
practices will not be tolerated. The U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission EEOC sued Mitsubishi's North American
division in April 1996, alleging that the automaker allowed women
at its Normal, Illinois, plant to be groped and subjected to lewd
jokes and behavior in a manner that was ``repeated, routine,
generalized, serious, pervasive and known to and supported by
management.'' (US-MITSUBISHI-HARASSMENT)
	   FLINT, Michigan (AP) _ Workers at a plant that makes parts for
most General Motors cars and trucks in North America prepared to go
on strike Thursday as the United Auto Workers increased its
pressure on the No. 1 automaker. A strike at the Delphi Flint East
complex could bring most of GM's North American production to a
standstill by the end of next week. By Thursday, a strike that
began June 5 at a Flint stamping plant already had led to layoffs
affecting more than 24,400 workers at eight assembly plants and 16
GM-owned parts plants from Mexico to Canada. (US-GM-STRIKE)

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Politicians and gay activists criticized
author Camilo Jose Cela Thursday after the Spanish literary giant
expressed distaste for gay and lesbian celebrations connected to
centennial celebrations for poet and playwright Federico Garcia
Lorca.
	   The 81-year-old Nobel laureate said Wednesday that he hoped his
own 100th birthday would be ``free of the support of gay groups.''
	   The leader of the main opposition Socialist Party, Joaquin
Almunia, said Cela's remarks were ``disgusting'' and showed the
novelist's ``inability to live in a plural society,'' the national
news agency EFE reported.
	   Lorca was 38 years old, and a major figure in the Spanish
literary vanguard, when he was killed by Gen. Francisco Franco's
Nationalist troops during the opening days of the Spanish Civil War
in 1936.
	   Lorca was relegated to the cultural shadows during Franco's
40-year regime because of his homosexuality.
	   The head of the Spanish Gay and Lesbian Federation Pedro Zerolo
dismissed the Cela's remarks as the predictable ruminations of a
reactionary.
	   ``The Nobel Prize for Literature is awarded for literary talent
and not for personal qualities'' he said.
	   Responding to the criticism, Cela apologized for any offense his
remarks had caused but refused to soften them, ``There is no doubt
about what I said'' he told EFE.
	   The 1998 ``Lorca Year'' has prompted a new surge of interest in
Spain's most translated modern poet, whose most famous works
include ``Gypsy Ballads'' and ``Poet in New York''.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Bob Hope and his wife Dolores have become
members of the papal knighthood.
	   ``You just name it, and they've always been willing to step
forward and share their gifts, their lives, with everyone,'' said
Cardinal Roger Mahony, who bestowed the honors Wednesday at St.
Charles Borromeo Church, just a few blocks from the couple's Toluca
Lake home.
	   During the private ceremony, the comedian was invested as knight
commander with the star designation and his wife, Dolores, as dame
with star in the Order of St. Gregory the Great.
	   Pope John Paul II bestows papal knighthoods on those of
unblemished character who have promoted the interests of humanity,
the Catholic Church and the Holy See, said the Rev. Gregory Coiro,
spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles.
	   ``I think it's a great honor,'' daughter Linda Hope said. ``I
think good deeds and good work transcend any particular religious
group.''
	   Hope, a non-Catholic, and his wife, who is Catholic, were to
have been invested in January along with news magnate Rupert
Murdoch, actor Ricardo Montalban and about 60 others. But the
couple was unable to attend.
	   Hope, 95, and his wife, 89, were blessed with many great talents
and have shared their many gifts with all those around them, Mahony
said.

	   CHELTENHAM, England (AP) _ After 145 years, one of England's top
private schools is making a radical change: older girls can now
wear pants to class.
	   Sixth-formers at Cheltenham Ladies' College _ who are about
17-years-old _ will be allowed to swap their required skirts for a
pair of regulation navy trousers, starting in September.
	   The move came after college chiefs asked parents and students
for their views on plans to redesign the school uniform, spokesman
Kim Hill said Thursday.
	   ``The uniform had not changed a great deal since the war and I
think that was just because it never occurred to anybody before,''
she said.
	   Students in the lower grades, however, still must wear their
traditional skirts and blouses.
	   ___
	   HONG KONG (AP)_ Chinese film star Gong Li received the ``Officer
des Arts et des Lettres'' _ France's highest award for the arts _
for her contribution to arts and culture to the French people.
	   ``This is such a great honor,'' Gong told The Associated Press
Television during the awards ceremony Wednesday at the French
Consulate in Hong Kong.
	   Other recipients of the award include Hollywood actors Michael
Douglas and Clint Eastwood.
	   The first Asian actress invited as judge during the Cannes film
festival, Gong Li began her career in director Zhang Yimou's first
film Red Sorghum while still attending the Central Drama Academy in
1985.
	   Her latest work is a film on Hong Kong's handover ``Chinese
Box'' directed by U.S. film maker Wayne Wang.
	   Gong lives in Hong Kong with her husband, a Singapore
businessman.

Crippled during Abacha years, Nigerian opposition keeps fighting

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Their strength ravaged by years of
government harassment, their leaders in prison or exile, Nigeria's
opposition movement is defiantly pressing ahead with plans for
pro-democracy protests Friday _ the first major test of the new
military regime of Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar.
	   The protest calls continued despite official insistence that any
gathering would be illegal _ and none-too-subtle threats of
violence.
	   ``The police are ready for anything that threatens the peace of
this country'' said Young Arebamen, a Lagos police spokesman. He
called the rallies unlawful and warned opposition leaders to call
them off.
	   Friday's protests were organized months ago to mark the
five-year anniversary of the annulment of the country's last
presidential elections on June 12, 1993, and to call for freedom
for Moshood Abiola, the imprisoned billionaire businessmen who is
believed to have won the vote.
	   But the demonstrations have taken on added significance, coming
just a few days after Abubakar was appointed leader of this
oil-rich but poverty-stricken West African country following the
heart attack death Monday of dictator Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   ``Certainly these demonstrations will go on,'' said Gani
Fawehinmi, a Lagos attorney leading calls for Nigerians to take to
the streets.
	   Fawehinmi expects few changes from the new leader. Abubakar has
already infuriated the opposition by offering only a vague pledge
to move forward with Abacha's flawed democratic reform program.
	   ``Abubakar is becoming the reincarnation of Abacha,'' he said.
	   While opposition groups called for protests and a nationwide
strike, they were focusing most of their efforts on a Lagos rally
scheduled for Friday afternoon despite the refusal of officials to
grant permission.
	   ``We do not need a permit to exercise our fundamental rights,''
said Fawehinmi. ``We have a right to demonstrate peacefully.''
	   What remained to be seen was just how much support the
opposition could rally.
	   Abacha's regime hobbled Nigeria's opposition movement with
brutal efficiency, arresting, imprisoning and torturing many
opposition leaders _ or driving them into exile.
	   These days, many demonstrations only attract a few hundred
protesters and strike calls are often completely ignored.
	   Trying to head off trouble ahead of Friday's rallies, the
government closed a Lagos technical college and a university and
shut down all primary and secondary schools in Lagos and Kwara
states, both important regions to the opposition movement.
	   Few people in Lagos said they planned to attend the Friday
protest.
	   ``I've not heard of the rally,'' said Amafari Alfred-Belleh, a
cosmetics saleswoman. ``There's little or nothing the opposition
groups can do. They government has all the power, they have the
guns.''
	   During Abacha's years of brutal and oppressive rule, corruption
tore away at Nigeria's economy and its infrastructure, leaving both
in shambles. Despite the country's vast oil reserves, motorists
line up and wait for hours at the few gas stations that haven't run
dry.
	   Abubakar has given no details on how the transition _ which
includes Aug. 1 presidential elections and an Oct. 1 return to
civilian rule _ would work.

	   DOLGENBRODT, Germany (AP) _ When a house for refugees in this
lakeside resort burned to the ground the day before 86 Africans
were to move in, authorities quickly caught and convicted a
teen-age neo-Nazi.
	   Then the arsonist started talking, and prosecutors uncovered a
conspiracy involving not only disaffected youths but otherwise
upstanding citizens who wanted to keep the asylum seekers out.
	   The case, combined with recent electoral successes for a
far-right party, raised new questions about the breadth of
anti-foreigner sentiment in Germany, especially in the formerly
closed and communist east.
	   Five men allegedly involved in the plot go on trial Friday in
Brandenburg state court in Frankfurt an der Oder, four charged with
complicity in the Nov. 1, 1992 crime and the fifth with being an
accessory.
	   While they and two others awaiting trial on perjury charges are
the only ones charged, prosecutor Petra Marx says she believes most
of Dolgenbrodt's 300 residents share the blame.
	   ``They might not have been actively involved,'' she said. ``But
the atmosphere in the village was not the best at that time,
everyone admits.
	   ``The moral guilt that many in the village carry, that's not
something we can go after with legal means, but has to be dealt
with in the political arena.''
	   Karl Pfannenschwarz, mayor since 1993, denies people in
Dolgenbrodt, just southeast of Berlin, are racist and says everyone
has condemned the burning of the house.
	   Then he tries to explain: The town were told initially that
Gypsies were moving into the building, which had been a summer
lodge for children in the communist times, and feared a crime wave.
	   ``People were afraid ... that their houses would be broken
into,'' Pfannenschwarz said in an interview in his red brick villa
on the lake shore.
	   Residents had protested, collected signatures and pulled
political stings in a vain attempt to stop the home from being
plunked into their sylvan idyll.
	   The night before the asylum-seekers were to move in, the house
burned to the ground.
	   Silvio Jaskowski, who was 18 at the time, was arrested in May
1993 and convicted in 1996 of setting the blaze. He was given two
years' probation.
	   Jaskowski told prosecutors the townspeople had paid him to
commit the crime, although residents denied that.
	   Last year, however, the alleged mastermind confessed.
	   Prosecutors say Thomas Oste, 41, who lived next door to the
planned refugee home with his wife and two young children, told
them he paid Jaskowski 2,000 marks (dlrs 1,100) to set the fire and
another 10,000 (5,700) later to keep quiet.
	   A friend of Jaskowski's from nearby Koenigs Wusterhausen, Renato
Paschke, 27, allegedly helped him set the fire.
	   Part of the money came from an electrician neighbor, Gerd
Graefen, who had land he wanted to sell and was afraid the refugees
would mean lower property values, prosecutors charge.
	   Hans-Juergen Schmidt, 49, allegedly supplied heating oil for the
Molotov cocktails; and his stepson, Marco Schmidt, 25, allegedly
drove Jaskowski to pick up his money.
	   All five _ on trial now _ had denied any involvement during
Jaskowski's original trial.
	   The 86 Africans who were to be housed in Dolgenbrodt were sent
elsewhere. The rubble was cleared out immediately and today, not a
trace of the building or the inferno can be seen on the wooded,
overgrown lot.
	   ``So their measures were successful, you have to say,'' Marx
said, wryly. ``No asylum-seekers ever came there.''

<TEXT>
	   YELLOWKNIFE, Northwest Territories (AP) _ It's intended to be a
cheerful, no-fault divorce: the upcoming division of Canada's vast
Northwest Territories into two separately governed pieces of
tundra, rocks and ice.
	   But across one of the world's least-populated regions _ 65,000
people in an area bigger than India _ anticipation of the breakup
is mixed with apprehension.
	   In the eastern half of the Territories, to be named Nunavut,
Inuits' pride at gaining self-governance is tempered by poverty,
unemployment, crime and substance abuse rates that far exceed the
national average.
	   The Inuits _ formerly known as Eskimos _ will make up 85 percent
of a population of 26,000.
	   The western half is groping for an identity: It doesn't even
have an official name to distinguish it from Nunavut, though
residents use the term ``Western Arctic'' while awaiting a final
decision.
	   And while the west faces less daunting economic problems than
the east, it faces a more complex political struggle: After the
split on April 1, 1999, its population will be divided almost 50-50
between aboriginals and whites, raising questions about how to
allocate political power.
	   ``It's not a source of friction, but it's a concern,'' said
Charles Dent, a white member of the territorial Cabinet in
Yellowknife. ``One way or another we'll have to find a way for all
of us to work together.''
	   Native leaders voice similar sentiments.
	   ``It's exciting, it's difficult,'' said Bill Erasmus, chief of
the region's biggest Indian tribe, the Dene. ``We need to have
patience and understanding of each other.''
	   A committee is drafting proposals for a new constitution that
eventually will be put in a plebiscite.
	   The basic choices are to form separate governments for
aboriginals and for the territory as a whole, or combine the two.
All the parties are reluctant to create any government body
specifically reserved for non-aboriginals.
	   The Western Arctic's Indians, plus the one Inuit community that
will remain after division, insist their self-government rights
cannot be diminished by any new constitution. They note that in the
Northwest Territories, unlike the rest of Canada, aboriginals have
rights to huge tracts of land instead of small reservations.
	   ``This is Dene country,'' Erasmus said. ``Some non-native people
bring baggage from the south, but they soon realize it's different
here. They can't do things they might do in the south, in terms of
neglecting us.''
	   Stephen Kakfwi, a former Dene chief who is now territorial
minister of economic development, recalled how some uneasy whites
formed a ``white brotherhood'' in the 1970s to counter what they
perceived as excessive native militancy.
	   ``We've come a long way since then,'' Kakfwi said. ``I see
aboriginal and non-aboriginal people really having made the
commitment to listen to each other.''
	   Though the Northwest Territories' breakup was endorsed by voters
in both halves, the logistics occasionally have been contentious.
	   For example, Nunavut leaders favor creating their own power
company, rather than sharing the one now serving the entire
territory. There also has been sparring over who gets the
territory's distinctive polar bear-shaped license plates.
	   Nunavut is claiming the plates because most of the territory's
real polar bears live in the east. Westerners aren't ready to give
up easily.
	   ``People here are very fond of those license plates,'' said
Cooper Langford, editor of a Yellowknife-based magazine called ``Up
Here.''
	   Within the Western Arctic, residents and politicians must decide
what name they want for their soon-to-be-shrunken territory. An
informal poll two years ago showed strong sentiment for keeping
Northwest Territories, while the joke name ``Bob'' was a distant
runner-up.
	   Many Indian leaders favor calling the region Denendeh _ ``our
land'' in the Dene language. Kakfwi, for one, scoffs at the idea of
retaining Northwest Territories as the name.
	   ``It's a colonial name,'' he said. ``We have to get a name that
identifies us as a people.''
	   A task force of Western Arctic legislators is deliberating
issues related to the breakup, ranging from whether to keep the
Northwest Territories flag, to how to celebrate the division next
April.
	   Langford said some westerners are unsure whether they should be
celebrating at all.
	   ``Nunavut is in the process of building something,'' he said.
``Here in the Western Arctic, it's more like a corporate
downsizing. ... There's a lot of uncertainty.''

In cloudy Holland, a bright future for solar power
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMERSFOORT, Netherlands (AP) _ It's another typically cloudy
Dutch day, but Rien van Stigt can still hear the soft hum of his
solar-powered boiler heating up water for dishes and the shower.
	   The overcast Netherlands seems an unlikely hot spot for solar
energy. Yet the sun's meager offerings are providing electricity
and hot water for homes in an expanding enclave of this central
city unofficially dubbed the ``solar suburb.''
	   With solar collectors and panels sprouting from rooftops and
roadsides across the Netherlands, some say solar power could one
day overshadow wind turbines, the modern cousins of the storied
Dutch windmills.
	   ``Holland is a very busy country with a lot of people and little
space,'' says Stefan Wink at Novem, a Dutch environmental agency.
``It's not easy to get space for wind turbines. With solar energy,
the advantage is that there are a lot of houses.''
	   That means a lot of rooftops for solar panels, which convert the
sun's rays to electricity, and solar collectors, which heat water
piped through them. Hundreds of houses already have them to
supplement electricity and natural gas.
	   And an estimated 26,000 Dutch homeowners like Van Stigt have had
their water-heating systems fitted with solar boilers. The highly
insulated boilers circulate solar-warmed water around an inner tank
to heat up tap water for the house; a natural gas burner kicks in
if there isn't enough sunlight.
	   ``It's running almost as soon as the sun goes up,'' says Van
Stigt, an environmental science teacher. ``It functions whenever
there is light _ cloudy or not.''
	   Of course, the sun alone can't run every hair dryer and stereo
system. But solar power will allow the Dutch to cut their use of
conventional energy and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, says Lex
Bosselaar, spokesman for Novem's solar thermal energy program.
	   ``You can feel every day when you're taking a shower that you're
doing something for the environment,'' he says.
	   Nearly 60 percent of the Netherlands' electricity is produced by
burning natural gas, followed by coal, 28 percent; nuclear, 5
percent; oil, 4.6 percent; burning waste products, 2.4 percent; and
wind, 0.5 percent.
	   Solar energy accounts for just .002 percent now, but is expected
to rise over the next decade. The Economic Affairs Ministry is
crusading to have 10 percent of the country's energy needs come
from sustainable resources by 2010.
	   Wind turbines are part of the plans. But because many Dutch
consider them eyesores and they take up so much space, some of the
streamlined mechanical giants have been banished to a less
conspicuous setting offshore in the country's inland sea.
	   Solar technology is getting a far warmer response.
	   The house Van Stigt rents in Nieuwland, an environmentally
friendly housing community in Amersfoort, 40 kilometers (25 miles)
east of Amsterdam, is crowned with 5 1/2 square meters (nearly 60
square feet) of solar collectors and panels that are barely visible
from the ground.
	   A few streets over, however, bright blue, shimmering solar
panels that construction workers are installing on steep roofs are
almost blinding.
	   Astrid de Ruiter, spokeswoman for Novem, says Van Stigt's house
was designed when architects were being conservative with solar
equipment. ``Now the architects are trying to use the panels to
make the homes look different and special,'' she says.
	   Construction on 500 dwellings with the highly visible panels
began in December, and the 28 million guilder (dlrs 14 million)
project is expected to be finished in the summer of 1999.
	   Once completed, Nieuwland will boast a total of 15,000 square
meters (162,000 square feet) of solar panels, generating
electricity and sending it to the main power grid for
redistribution to Nieuwland's homes.
	   The panels for the project were made by Shell Solar Energy, a
company owned by the Anglo-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch Shell.
	   ``The market is booming,'' says Goose Boxhoorn, president of
Shell Solar. ``It's still a rather small business, but the
potential market is huge.''
	   In spring and summer, when the sun shines the most, the local
energy supplier, REMU, pays homeowners 25 cents (US 12 cents) per
kilowatt hour for the solar energy their rooftop panels feed into
the grid. That helps offset solar homeowners' energy bills for fall
and winter, when Holland is extra-cloudy and they have to buy more
conventional power from REMU.
	   Cost-efficient solar boilers save the average homeowner 140
guilders (dlrs 70) a year on natural gas costs. But solar energy in
general is no bargain.
	   Few people can afford the 50,000 guilder (dlrs 25,000) price tag
on the finest solar technology now available: a system capable of
meeting 80 percent of a house's energy needs. So Boxhoorn counsels
compromise.
	   ``If we reduce the number of panels so they generate 10 percent
of the energy, the price is roughly 6,000 guilders (dlrs 3,000),''
he says. ``Such a price is affordable.''

One family's cold trek from attack to exile

<TEXT>
	   TROPOJA, Albania (AP) _ They didn't have time to change their
shoes.
	   The family was able to bundle their youngest, 2-year-old Anita,
in a sky blue snowsuit. The rest grabbed sweaters and heavy coats
before fleeing the attack in Smolica _ one of the latest villages
pounded in the offensive against ethnic Albanian separatists in
Kosovo.
	   But their boots and cold-weather shoes were upstairs in a room
blasted by a tank shell. So they began the 16-hour march through
the mountains with summer sneakers and sandals. Only Anita, carried
on her father's shoulders, had fur-lined galoshes.
	   Ten members of the Kourti family _ from Anita to her 77-year-old
great-grandmother Aida _ walked through the night. Each hour, the
altitude was higher and the temperature lower. Above 3,000 meters
(9,900 feet), cold mud caked their feet.
	   They built a fire to warm themselves before heading for the
Albanian border before dawn on Thursday. Then they ate the last of
their food: some bread, sausage and two boiled eggs sliced thin so
everyone could have some. They had packed three bags of clothes and
they fished out some dry socks.
	   ``We looked back once more at Kosovo and wondered, `Is this a
final goodbye?''' said Haxhi Kourti. ``We saw sheep in the
mountains and I thought, `Even the sheep are more lucky than us.
The mountain is their home. We have nowhere.'''
	   Thousands of others have made similar treks since the Serb
military began targeting villages in late May in its campaign
against the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Up to 12,000 people have crossed into Albania, the U.N. refugee
agency estimates. Some 8,000 have fled to the Yugoslav republic of
Montenegro. Altogether, around 65,000 have been displaced from
their homes in Kosovo since March.
	   Aid groups are desperately trying to work out strategies to deal
with a growing refugee crisis in one of the most impoverished and
inaccessible areas of the Balkans. There are fears of another major
wave of refugees if Serbs ignore Western warnings to halt the
offensive and turn their guns on Djakovica, a main western Kosovo
town with about 80,000 people.
	   ``This could get much worse before it gets better,'' said Laura
Boldrini, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees.
	   Because of poor roads to northeastern Albania, the U.N. agency
is considering organizing a special river ferry to bring supplies
closer to the refugees.
	   ``The logistics are really, really very difficult,'' said Ms.
Boldrini.
	   ``We are looking toward a potential humanitarian disaster if
this situation keeps on until winter sets in,'' said Daloni
Carlise, a coordinator with the International Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies. ``No one has any idea when, or if, these people
can return home.''
	   The Kourti family and about 30 others from Smolica walked
through an alpine meadow of white daisies toward the border village
of Tropoja, where they heard they have a distant cousin. A flatbed
truck sent to look for refugees took them the rest of the way.
	   They stopped to ask directions to the house.
	   Haxhi looked in the direction of shots fired in the distance. He
had about 300 German marks (about dlrs 200). He planned to leave
some with his family and use the rest to buy a gun.
	   ``Then I'm going back to fight the Serbs,'' he said. ``I will
not stay here.''
	   ``I'm coming with you,'' declared 20-year-old Bejrem, his eldest
son. ``We'll see,'' said his father. ``We'll see.''
	   They pounded at the metal gate at their cousin's home. Finally,
the cousin, a pistol wedged in his belt, pulled back the latch.
``How many?'' he asked.
	   ``We are 10,'' said Haxhi, and then he began to recount how they
were connected on their family tree. A deep sense of family
obligations binds the Albanians _ which has helped so far keep the
refugee crisis in check for the time being. The cousin could not
turn them away.
	   He ushered them into the back garden, shaded by a terrace of
grape vines. On a woodpile were more than 15 AK-47 rifles. ``Family
protection,'' said the cousin. Haxhi said he would ask if he could
bring one back to Albania to fight.
	   The cousin's dog, Gigi, carefully sniffed the new arrivals.
	   The Kourti family was led into a single bedroom, decorated with
vases of plastic flowers and a portrait of the cousin's
stern-looking grandfather. The room was all the cousin had left.
Already, about 25 other relatives from Kosovo were staying in his
two-story farmhouse.
	   Anita's grandmother rubbed her feet. Anita found a teddy bear
somewhere in the house. She hugged it and started to cry.

Demands grow for release of jailed rebel chief of East Timor
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ The forces of East Timor's rebel chief
have been pummeled while he sits in a jail cell hundreds of miles
away from his disputed homeland. Yet Xanana Gusmao remains a potent
symbol of protest against Indonesian authority.
	   Now, as Indonesia softens its stance on the territory it invaded
in 1975, the fate of Gusmao has emerged as key to any solution to
the bitter impasse that grips the former Portuguese colony.
	   Although the new, reform-minded government has released some
political prisoners, it appears reluctant to free Gusmao from a
high-security jail in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. The
Indonesian military views him as a criminal, not a political
detainee.
	   Yet the thousands of East Timorese who hail the 52-year-old
Xanana as a hero say their principal demands are freedom for the
longtime guerrilla and a vote on independence.
	   The bearded Xanana, who has a sharp sense of humor and a taste
for poetry-writing, was arrested in 1992 and is serving a 20-year
sentence for his role as leader of the rebel group known as
Fretilin.
	   Indonesia declared East Timor as its 27th province in 1976, and
forced separatist rebels to retreat to mountain hideouts. Yet
Xanana embodies resistance to Indonesia for many in a land where
resentment runs deep.
	   ``Xanana is our leader,'' said Fernao Gomes, a student
demonstrator at East Timor University in Dili, the capital of the
half-island territory.
	   A dozen political prisoners in East Timor, granted their freedom
in a decree signed by President B.J. Habibie, refused to leave jail
Thursday because they wanted a guarantee that Xanana would also be
released.
	   Even the appointed governor of the territory, considered by
critics to be a puppet of Indonesian policy, said Thursday that
Gusmao and other East Timorese jailed for opposing Indonesia _ by
peaceful as well as violent means _ should be set free.
	   ``The release of Xanana is important in terms of finding a
solution,'' Gov. Abilio Osorio Soares said Thursday in an interview
in his colonial-era office.
	   The reverence with which many people hold Gusmao was evident at
a pro-independence rally Wednesday. Several thousand emotional
demonstrators shouted ``Release Xanana'' and held aloft posters of
his image.
	   East Timorese activist and 1996 Nobel Peace Prize co-winner Jose
Ramos-Horta said the prize should have gone to Gusmao.
	   Gusmao has won international sympathy, too. South African
President Nelson Mandela, who was jailed during the apartheid era,
visited Gusmao during a state visit to Indonesia in July 1997 and
appealed for his release.
	   The call was ignored by then-President Suharto, who quit May 21
amid nationwide discontent after three decades of authoritarian
rule.
	   The reform agenda of Habibie has failed to impress Gusmao, who
said in an interview this week on Portuguese state radio that the
new president was a ``clown'' who had collaborated with Indonesia's
often violent handling of East Timor.
	   Gusmao was arrested in Dili, where he was hiding out after
spending years battling Indonesian troops from jungle camps. He
communicates from jail with his supporters through visiting
activists, letters and sometimes cellular telephones.

Conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea boon to Djibouti port
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VERONIQUE BAGARRY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DJIBOUTI (AP) _ A little over a year ago, the port of Djibouti
was in the doldrums and slashed its tariffs in a price war with the
Eritrean port of Assab in an attempt to attract business from
landlocked Ethiopia.
	   Today, all Ethiopian exports and imports pass through Djibouti
since a simmering border dispute between its two western neighbors
boiled over into open conflict a month ago.
	   After fighting broke out on its northern border with Eritrea,
Ethiopia ordered all traders to cease business with the Red Sea
ports of Assab and Massawa and to ship and receive goods via
Djibouti on the Gulf of Aden.
	   Djibouti _ a 23,200 square-kilometer (8,958-square-mile)
volcanic chunk in the crook of northeastern Africa where the Red
Sea meets the Gulf of Aden _ lives from port revenues.
	   Until 1993, Eritrea was part of Ethiopia. But even after
Eritrean independence, Ethiopia had special arrangements for the
use of the ports _ and it also owned most of the ships.
	   But late last year when Eritrea introduced its own currency, the
nakfa, and suggested that it be treated on par with the Ethiopian
birr it had been using, Ethiopia retorted that all trade would have
to be conducted in U.S. dollars.
	   Djibouti continued to accept birr in payment, and since last
November, Ethiopia began to move more and more of its business
towards the former French territory that a century ago served as
the entry point for contraband weapons the Ethiopians used to fight
off Italian invaders.
	   To handle the increased volume of merchandise, port authorities
have opened a new parking area for trucks carrying containers full
of coffee, Ethiopia's principal export and earner of hard currency.
	   Port chief Aden Ahmed Doualeh said two large warehouses have
been prepared to store the coffee, while a third will hold other
Ethiopian exports.
	   Aschenaki Gebrehiwot, general secretary of the Ethiopian Coffee
Exporters Association, said there is only one problem _ Ethiopia
does not have enough trucks to move the containers in and out of
the port fast enough.
	   Before the outbreak of hostilities, Ethiopian imports through
Djibouti, principally refined petroleum products, amounted to
300,000 tons over a two-month period. With exclusivity assured _ at
least in the short run _ Djibouti may handle as much as 2.5 million
tons of Ethiopian imports for the year.
	   As the French Defense Ministry moves to downsize, France's
military installation in Djibouti is growing smaller, from 3,200 to
2,700 troops this year. And as the French presence diminishes, so
does the livelihood of the majority of the 600,000 citizens of
Djibouti.
	   The jump in volume of Ethiopian imports and exports means more
jobs in the port, and the government is eager to employ soldiers
recently demobilized from an army that had ballooned to fight a
rebellion at the beginning of the decade.
	   Nearly all Ethiopian traffic to and from Djibouti moves by road.
	   There is a joint-owned Ethiopian-Djibouti railway built a
century ago by the French, but it needs a complete overhaul. The
consortium that operates the railway is looking for a private firm
to run it, and the European Union is financing a feasibility study.

Long associated with Mafia, Palermo enjoys cultural spring

<TEXT>
	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) _ In Palermo's most rundown quarters,
tourists who follow the scent of semolina and sesame _ sweet
leftovers from the city's rich Arabic heritage _ still risk meeting
muggers on mopeds.
	   But these days strollers also stand a good chance of
encountering smiling Palermitani who invite you to take a free tour
of monuments that were long closed to the public.
	   For decades, Palermo knew the shame of being synonymous with the
Mafia, danger and degradation. These days the city is busily
redefining itself.
	   In the impoverished Kalsa neighborhood, where once only the
naive or mob-protected ventured after dusk, couples come for
romantic evenings lingering as late as midnight on the grounds of a
roofless, Gothic basilica that now plays host to warm-weather
concerts.
	   People used to throw broken furniture into the belly of the
early 16th century church, Santa Maria dello Spasimo. Now
floodlights illuminate the towering, ivy-covered tree in the nave,
and some Palermitani who were among southern Italy's army of
unemployed earn modest, city-paid salaries giving tours.
	   In the shadow of a slum, with block after block of bleak,
concrete buildings, a complex of abandoned furniture factories and
citrus-fruit storehouses is being converted into a cultural mall.
	   ``Palermo's bad image was so strong, you can't eliminate it in
just a few years,'' said Francesco Carnevale, a university student.
``But certainly it's the right start.''
	   Carnevale had his books on banking techniques spread out on a
spacious table in a library _ once a vacant warehouse. There's not
enough money for the library to buy lending books yet, but the
place is packed with high school and college students.
	   ``I come here nearly every day because I concentrate better.
There's silence, tranquility,'' Carnevale said.
	   Only a few of the ``Cantieri Culturali'' (Cultural Work Spaces)
in the complex have been restored so far, like the cavernous room
where college drama students one afternoon debated which work of
Bertolt Brecht to perform, or the largely empty space dubbed ``the
bathtub'' where sculptors can exhibit their work.
	   Still it's already a haven for artists and others seeking quiet
gathering space in this noisy, bustling city of 700,000 people.
	   In a city where political squabbling and bureaucratic snafus
kept its showcase, art nouveau Massimo Theater dark for 23 years _
until it reopened in 1997 _ some planners, like culture
commissioner Francesco Giambrone, believe modest steps are better
than none.
	   ``We've passed from a phase of gaining back a sense of belonging
to the city to overcoming the shame of being a Palermitan,''
Giambrone said.
	   The remaking of Palermo's image began in the mid-1980s with the
anti-Mafia crusade of Mayor Leoluca Orlando.
	   But while some corners have been turned, reminders abound that
crime and violence are not far away.
	   Stylish restaurants, for example, have opened in response to
Palermo's thirst for some nightlife. But while the kitchen at the
Albertone offers new touches like ground sea urchins wrapped in
radicchio leaves, patrons must ring a bell for admittance.
	   In late March, some of the 6,000 part-time public employees
whose jobs range from street-cleaning to tour-giving went on a
rampage to protest the city government's failure to renew some
contracts. Protesters slashed tires on buses and set fire to piles
of garbage.
	   Not all stopped working when the contracts expired.
	   ``We want to show we want to work, so we're working without
pay,'' said Piera Badalamenti, one of the guides at the Spasimo
church. There, guides still give tours but have cut back on hours,
with the monument now closing at 8 p.m. instead of midnight.

As outside world closes in, can the French still be French?

<TEXT>
	   SAULIEU, France (AP) _ While their cows dozed, farmers huddled
around their TV sets for the May extravaganza: the last
``Seinfeld,'' in English, on a French satellite channel named
Jimmy.
	   It was a powerful sign of the times for a nation gnawed by
questions, in deepest Burgundy at the very heart and belly of
France, as much as in fancy Parisian parlors.
	   In a globalizing, Anglicizing, homogenizing world, with Europe
merging into a single economic and political conglomerate, and
American pop culture sweeping the Earth, can the French still be
French?
	   After two millennia of conquering kingdoms, inspiring revolution
and civilizing a benighted world, what awaits the nation of 60
million in the third?
	   And where do liberty, fraternity and equality fit in with urban
violence, disaffected youth, joblessness, homelessness, collapsing
authority, political scandal, police brutality, racism and
xenophobia?
	   Billions will watch World Cup soccer in France this month, amid
trappings of Gallic grandeur. But the cameras won't get to Paulette
Millot's place, where a greater game is being played out in the
smoky gloom.
	   Within the half-empty little bistro at Alligny, a rural village
near the languishing old culinary paradise of Saulieu, the past
seems to be losing in overtime to the future.
	   ``La crise,'' as the French call it, is specific and personal in
gathering spots like Paulette's, dotted all across rural areas
where France's roots are deepest.
	   Men in filthy wool caps grumble that the European Union might
ban their raw milk cheese. Women in muddy boots fear their sons
becoming hooked on Paris and leaving the farm. They still talk in
long-gone ``old francs,'' with two extra zeros. They're suspicious
of this new European currency called the euro.
	   ``Yes, life as we knew it is ending,'' laments Mrs. Millot, who
once had to serve invading German troops and now is happy to see
the odd German tourist stray off the autoroute and into Alligny.
	   Her grandmother opened the bistro back when Alligny was a rich
farming community, with shops and a comfortable hotel. In its
heyday, it offered three meals a day instead of just drinks.
	   For three generations, the one-room pub bound together a
community where vintners fretted over rain, grandmothers bragged
about their boeuf bourguignon and the priest lingered over cognac.
	   Now Mrs. Millot is 77, bent and so nearly blind that she sneaks
a finger into the glass so she pours the right amount. Regulars sit
by the potbellied stove on chairs antique dealers would kill to
own.
	   ``When I go, Alligny is finished,'' she said, probably not
exaggerating. The only shop in town is a bread dispensary, not even
a real bakery, with a few shelves of groceries.
	   In the cities, many see ``la crise'' as a global issue. Victor
Hugo, after all, once mused, ``France, France, without you the
world would be alone.''
	   Clearly, the world is not alone yet. French restaurants, fashion
houses, factories, universities and galleries continue to thrive.
France is, by far, the world's most visited country.
	   But substantial change is afoot, and debate bordering on
national psychosis rages over how France can keep up with modern
times while maintaining its character.
	   Suddenly, a sharp dose of what the French have always scorned in
America is upon them, shattering treasured myths about what makes
them different.
	   Papers tell of serial killers, satanic sects _ even shortened
lunch breaks. Frenchmen, fairly or not, see the rise of urban
violence and occasional gunplay as being as American as McDonalds
or ``Seinfeld.''
	   Police shun the toughest suburbs of Paris, Lyon and Marseille,
where graffiti runs to obscene English, and conversation is often
in Arabic, Vietnamese or any of several African tongues.
	   Unemployment is 12 percent. Aimless kids tear up schools and
torch cars. Farmers dump cauliflower on railway tracks to protest
falling subsidies.
	   Farmers' children are moving to Paris, if not London, leaving
vast pockets of rural desert. Supermarkets and shopping malls are
hammering the small merchants. Bakers who used to pride themselves
on their croissants and baguette now buy them frozen from
franchises.
	   The old politics are in turmoil. Jean-Marie Le Pen's National
Front, called Nazi and fascist by its foes, has split the right.
The Communists are partners of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's
Socialist Party.
	   To prepare for European monetary union, the state wants to shed
its bulky share of the economy, revive debt-ridden state industries
and cut back on various forms of welfare.
	   But these measures have triggered crippling strikes in recent
years. The latest, by airline pilots, disrupted the country just as
32 national soccer teams were gathering in France for the World
Cup, the last global sports event of the millennium.

SAULIEU: the millennium.

	   Yet for all this disquiet, a broad sampling of opinion from one
end of France to the other suggests that optimists hold the
majority.
	   ``Our foundations will remain,'' declared Paule Blondelet, a
lifelong friend of Mrs. Millot's, who worked for Francois
Mitterrand when he was mayor of nearby Chateau-Chinon, long before
he became president.
	   ``The more that France modernizes, the more we hold onto our
values,'' she said. ``We are going back to our basic resources, to
our families and traditions, as a counterweight.''
	   As evidence, she points to holiday gatherings, when
great-grandchildren hover at her elbow as she roasts a haunch of
lamb. Or the loyalty of friends.
	   But like most other French optimists, she also admits to deep
fears. Some worry about restive youth and the effect of 4 million
immigrants on the social fabric. And Mrs. Blondelet is frightened
about where such worries will lead.
	   ``I'm terrified of the National Front,'' she said. ``Voters are
fooled, just like Hitler duped the Germans in the 1930s, with talk
of national pride, security, old values, a car in every garage.''
	   The Front, a France-first party which blames society's worst
ills on North African immigrants and globalization, scares many
people. Leader Le Pen's polished veneer often fails to mask a bully
beneath. He has been convicted of roughing up and insulting a woman
Socialist candidate and banned from political office for three
years. He once belittled the Holocaust as a detail of history.
	   President Jacques Chirac calls the Front ``racist and
xenophobic,'' but it scores near 15 percent in national voting and
higher in many local elections. Four of 22 regions are run by
center-right governors who got their jobs only because of National
Front support.
	   In Vitrolles, a National Front-controlled city near Marseille, a
special black-shirted police force enforces the law aggressively.
Liberal newspapers and books are purged from the municipal library.
	   Plenty of people oppose the National Front. The two center-right
parties each expelled regional governors who accepted Front
support. But for many, the Front is only a symptom of a bigger
problem.
	   Sophie Body-Gendrot, a sociologist with a team of researchers
taking France's pulse, believes her country's troubles are far
worse than most people think, endangering the very foundations of
traditional society.
	   ``It's easy to single out suburban kids, or National Front
voters, but it's much more widespread than that,'' she says, citing
data she gathered for a report to Prime Minister Jospin.
	   She finds that urban violence is linked to rural revolt; that
generic fear more than racism feeds the National Front; that
squeezed by poverty, disgusted by politics as usual, people are
simply turning off.
	   ``Whole segments of society are rejecting authority, not paying
rent, refusing the old norms of civility,'' Body-Gendrot said.
``It's getting worse, and I don't see solutions.''
	   ``We need much more dialogue,'' she concluded, ``but the French
don't know how to engage in dialogue.''
	   Disturbing news of the present is mixed with the appearance of
ghosts from the past.
	   In April, a court in Bordeaux sentenced Maurice Papon, a former
government minister, to 10 years in prison for sending 1,500 Jews
to German death camps while serving as a regional police chief in
the Vichy government of World War II.
	   Testimony opened old wounds, recounting collaboration,
capitulation, cowardice. While some applauded the sentence, others
wondered why Papon went unpunished for 50 years.
	   During the trial, newspapers brought back a more recent ghost.
They revealed that Papon had ordered Paris police to shoot Algerian
anti-war demonstrators on sight when he was police chief in the
1960s. Dozens of bodies were dumped secretly into the Seine River.
	   Germany ranks high among French insecurities. In a little over a
century, three invasions have blitzed across the Rhine. The last
bitter occupation ended well within living memory.
	   And now many see the European Union being structured with a
decidedly Teutonic accent.
	   When EU members sought a president of the new European Central
Bank, all but France agreed on a Dutchman who was strongly backed
by Germany. Chirac held out for a Frenchman, forcing a compromise.
	   Reaction across Europe excoriated Chirac for acting selfishly
and undermining the euro, the new currency. But many French people
approved of their president resisting what they perceived as German
hegemony.
	   If these various existentialist conflicts take many forms, the
unifying metaphor is food. The centerpiece of France's art de vivre
has always been a meal made from the freshest ingredients, lovingly
prepared, savored course by course.
	   Now people have less time to shop, cook and eat, to talk across
the table about grand ideas; that is, to be French.
	   But again, in any random sampling, the optimists still prevail.
	   ``The McDonalds phenomenon is a matter of circumstance, and it
changes nothing,'' pronounces Bernard Loiseau of the Cote d'Or
restaurant in Saulieu, who is held in godlike reverence among
serious eaters.
	   ``OK, so people are often in a hurry and only have time to wolf
down a sandwich,'' he says. ``But the idea of dressing up, going
out, celebrating a birthday or a marriage _ that is sacred.''
	   Open borders mean new challenges for France, Loiseau says,
certainly no death knell.
	   ``I'm all for enlarging Europe, but does that mean I'll be
speaking German?'' he declaimed, arms flapping for emphasis.
``Never. We are French. French. That will not change.''

SAULIEU: not change.''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Just north on Highway 6, Jean-Claude Nuti brims with confidence
for a fresh new France planted firmly in old ground.
	   Thanks to electronics, Nuti can run his market research company
from his old Burgundy farm, e-mailing complex graphics to New York
or brainstorming by cell phone atop his tractor.
	   His high-tech office is lined with antique leather-bound books,
and dank stone stairs lead down to heartwarming racks of supine
dusty bottles. His Paris apartment is filled with Asian artifacts.
	   Nuti's wife, Helene, a filmmaker and publicist, studies all
morning with a computer consultant, who then joins the family for a
long, sumptuous lunch, where the topic is Moliere's plays, not
Microsoft.
	   ``There is no contradiction between being part of the 21st
century and being French,'' he said, ``Some things will never
change.''
	   The Nutis' 23-year-old son, Lorenzo, modems off a dozen letters
a day to friends around the world. His sister, Liberte, is
returning to London after working at the Museum of Modern Art in
New York. Her fluent Chinese is getting rusty, but she prefers the
art world.
	   Every Christmas, and often in between, the family gathers around
the stone kitchen fireplace with Helene's mother and old friends.
	   ``Sure, things'll be a little different by the time I have my
own kids, and they're growing up,'' Lorenzo put it, ``but not
really. We will still respect the sort of life we grew up with.''
	   At tables like the Nutis', outsiders learn what makes Frenchness
so indelible.
	   Financial scandals that sully top government officials and
business leaders prompt bitter jokes and a shrug that says, so what
else is new?
	   In some ways, future change in France could reinforce the past.
	   A decade ago, Le Pen appropriated the national flag and Joan of
Arc as emblems of his France-first party. Now his left-wing
opponents are doing something similar.
	   Near the Bastille recently, leftist marchers chanted slogans and
waved the Tricolor in a display of patriotism that might have
brought amused derision from the same crowd only a few years ago.
	   France's problems, whether real or hypothetical, add up to ``la
crise'' whose solution the French can only guess at.
	   Jean-Guy Marenco, an independent builder and car fanatic in the
Var, seems to typify a majority. He works hard for small successes,
and his family lives comfortably enough. The euro doesn't scare
him.
	   ``Most people don't give a damn whether it's left or right, just
so long as it's honest,'' he says. ``If we can just get some
leaders who think of France ahead of themselves, we'll be fine.''
	   His remark might have been made around Paulette Millot's stove,
or in any neighborhood of Paris.
	   With a chuckle, Marenco concluded: ``That stuff about equality,
fraternity, liberty. We laugh about it, but down deep, we believe
in it. That's who the French are, and we expect to stay like
that.''

Another Baggio penalty drama; Brazil is only team to win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Four years after his last World Cup penalty cost
Italy the title, Roberto Baggio stepped up to the spot again.
	   In a shootout in Pasadena in 1994, Baggio fired over the bar,
Italy lost the final and Brazil won a record fourth world
championship.
	   This time Italy faced the dismay of losing its first game of
World Cup '98.
	   Only six minutes remained and Baggio, who had played only once
on the national team in the last three years, ran forward again.
This time he slotted the ball into the corner of the net to salvage
Italian pride in a 2-2 tie with Chile.
	   ``Certainly I thought of four years ago, but then I told myself
I was going to put the ball into the net this time,'' Baggio said
after the game in Bordeaux. ``Luckily I did.''
	   Baggio's penalty ordeal gave day two of the 4 1/2 week World Cup
has the championship's first big moment of drama. It even eclipsed
Tommy Boyd's own goal to give Brazil a 2-1 victory over Scotland on
day one.
	   The 2-2 tie in Bordeaux made it 11 goals in the first three
World Cup games after Brazil's victory over Scotland and the
Norway-Morocco 2-2 draw on the opening day.
	   It became 13 in four when Cameroon and Austria tied 1-1 in
Toulouse in another Group B game.
	   Pierre Njanko, making only his third appearance for the team,
went on a 40-yard run through the Austrian defense and fired the
Africans ahead 13 minutes from the end and Anton Polster became
Austria's top World Cup scorer with 16 goals with an injury time
leveller.
	   After four games, Brazil was the only team to win a game and
Scotland the only team to lose. Italy, Chile, Cameroon and Austria
are tied on one point in their group.
	   Day three saw three matches, host France against South Africa
and Denmark against Saudi Arabia in Group C and Paraguay against
Bulgaria in Group D.
	   Despite fears that FIFA's directive to punish tackles from
behind with expulsions would lead to a wave of red cards, there
were none in the opening four games.
	   There were five yellows in the Italy-Chile game but they didn't
detract from the drama.
	   After Marcelo had struck twice for Chile either side of half
time to overturn a 10th minute strike by Christian Vieri, Italy
looked sunk.
	   ``We risked to win in the final minutes, after risking to
lose,'' Baggio said. ``As expected the first World Cup match was
difficult and we suffered throughout against a team which played
very well today.''
	   Baggio even set up the penalty, his chip inside catching Chilean
defender Ronald Fuentes on the arm.
	   ``I did not try to stop the ball with my hand'' said a dismayed
Fuentes. ``The ball came to me. I am very sad because of the effort
my teammates made. We deserved to win.''
	   Off the field, a group of Japanese fans are furious that tickets
to their nation's first ever World Cup games have failed to
materialize.
	   Five Japanese travel agencies reportedly have decided to cancel
World Cup tours because some 12,000 tickets haven't turned up. A
group of 76 fans already at the team's training camp at
Aix-en-Provence wait to find out if even that much-smaller number
could be met.
	   ``I'm trying to be optimistic,'' said Masami Tachi, a
34-year-old housewife from Tokyo. ``But if we don't get tickets
soon, we're going to take the tour coordinator hostage. We will not
kill him.''

U.S. dollar jumps against yen, Tokyo stocks fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar jumped against the yen early
Friday, pushed higher after comments on the Japanese currency's
weakness by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. Tokyo stock
prices continued to decline.
	   The dollar bought 144.54 yen in early trading, up 2.86 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
143.79 yen overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
shed 54.80 points, or 0.36 percent, to 14,959.24 points at the
start of Friday's trading. On Thursday, the average closed down
325.22 points, or 2.12 percent.
	   Rubin, testifying before the Senate Finance Committee on
Thursday, reiterated that Japan must revive its ailing economy,
warning that ``Japan's economic difficulties and weak currency are
having substantial adverse impact on the East Asian countries.''
	   Rubin also said it will be up to Japan to stop the yen's slide.
	   Traders interpreted his remarks as a sign there would be no
coordinated intervention by the major industrialized nations to
prop up the yen.
	   But Japanese finance minister Hikaru Matsunaga said Friday that
Japan was ready to take decisive action against an excessive
weakening of the yen.
	   He said Japan's partners from the Group of Seven nations were
also ready to cooperate on such action.
	   ``The G-7 said at their April Washington meeting that they are
ready to communicate and cooperate if there is a sharp change in
foreign exchange,'' he told a regular press conference.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange was down 5.03 points, or 0.43
percent, to 1,178.78 points. The TOPIX closed down 19.79 points, or
1.65 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.275 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.245 percent, driving its price down to 111.46 yen from 111.68
yen.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar surged against the yen early
Friday, pushed higher after comments on the Japanese currency's
weakness by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. Tokyo stock
prices continued to slide.
	   The dollar bought 144.54 yen in early trading, up 2.86 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
143.79 yen overnight.
	   At one point, the dollar moved as high as 144.75 yen in Tokyo,
matching its most recent previous high on August 30, 1990.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
shed 107.00 points, or 0.71 percent, moving to 14,907.04 points in
the first 30 minutes of trading. On Thursday, the average closed
down 325.22 points, or 2.12 percent.
	   The Nikkei index last traded below 15,000 points on Jan. 14.
	   Rubin, testifying before the Senate Finance Committee on
Thursday, reiterated that Japan must revive its ailing economy,
warning that ``Japan's economic difficulties and weak currency are
having substantial adverse impact on the East Asian countries.''
	   Rubin also said it will be up to Japan to halt the yen's slide.

	   ``The G-7 said at their April Washington meeting that they are
ready to communicate and cooperate if there is a sharp change in
foreign exchange,'' he told a regular press conference.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said Friday morning he does not
think the dollar at 144 yen reflects Japanese economic
fundamentals.
	   ``The fact that a situation like this continues shows that the
U.S. isn't interested in talking about current account balance
issues,'' Hashimoto told reporters.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange was down 6.56 points, or 0.56
percent, to 1,172.25 points. The TOPIX closed down 19.79 points, or
1.65 percent, the day before.
	   Market sentiment was weak because of the yen's sharp fall and
its negative impact on other Asian economies, traders said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.275 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.245 percent, driving its price down to 111.46 yen from 111.68
yen.

World Cup: German-American aims to humble his old friends
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France (AP) _ For his first 31 years,
Thomas Dooley was as German as sauerkraut. Now he's captain of the
U.S. soccer team. That could be grounds for mixed emotions Monday,
ja?
	   No way, Uncle Sam.
	   ``I want to beat Germany,'' he said, ``because if we beat
Germany, we are in the second round.''
	   It's not revenge in Monday's World Cup match in Paris, not a
desire to pound the guys who passed him over for the German
national team. But perhaps there's a little bit of
``schadenfreude'' _ a German word that means getting satisfaction
from another's misery.
	   ``Most people think in Germany that America is not that good in
soccer,'' he said.
	   Dooley, however, has earned praise. He was a winner before he
came to America, playing for Kaiserslautern's Bundesliga champion
in 1991, its German Cup winner in 1990 and Schalke 04's UEFA Cup
champ in 1996.
	   The oldest player on the team at 37, Dooley had never visited
the United States until early 1992, when he went to America to pick
up his passport.
	   Before that he had not realized he was eligible to become a U.S.
citizen, as the son of an American. His father was in the U.S.
Army, married a German, then disappeared.
	   During the late 1980s and early '90s, Dooley had come close to
making the German national team three times. But in each instance,
he got hurt.
	   ``I was so sad,'' Dooley said. ``My wife asked why I was so
upset. I told her that the biggest dream that I have is to play in
the World Cup.''
	   Then she said, ``Maybe you shouldn't play for Germany?''
	   ``What should I do, play for Italy or Spain? I can only play for
Germany,'' Dooley remembered saying.
	   Six months later, a U.S. Soccer Federation scout met him and
asked why his name didn't sound German. Dooley explained his past
and soon he was on his way to the United States.
	   When Dooley joined the national team, he spoke little English
and had to rely on bilingual teammates. Now, he's fluent.
	   He's also become a leader. In 1993, when the Americans played
Germany for the first time ever, he scored in a 4-3 loss.
	   ``Playing against the country where I've lived 32 years and
having friends in Germany who were watching back home on television
paying attention to my performance was a funny feeling,'' he said
then.
	   He's spent the last 1 1-2 seasons with the MLS' Columbus Crew
and plans to stay in the United States when his soccer career is
over, preferably near a beach where the weather's warm.
	   U.S. coach Steve Sampson is looking to Dooley to keep the
Americans organized against the world's most physical team.
	   Because of Dooley's ability to react to the flow of play,
Sampson said, ``It's almost like having an assistant coach on the
field.''

World Cup: Good times now, better times ahead for Women's World
</HEADLINE>
Cup &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ It's 2071, and fans are pouring into the latest
version of the Rose Bowl, filling every seat and cheering their
heads off for the 21st Women's World Cup.
	   And somewhere, hair gray but still perky, organizer Marla
Messing is saying, ``I told you so.''
	   As president of the organizing committee for next year's third
edition of the Women's World Cup in the United States, Messing
knows she is into something good _ a growing phase of the world's
biggest sport, in one of the few countries in the world where stars
of the women's national soccer team probably are more recognized
than the men's.
	   With ticket sales already soaring and international interest
building, Messing knows that things will only get better _ for
women's soccer and women's sports in general.
	   ``The tournament doesn't have the history of the men's World
Cup,'' Messing said. ``But when it returns to the United States in
70 or 80 years, there will be no trouble getting 70,000 or 80,000
people in the stadiums.''
	   Starting June 19, 1999, Messing and her organizing cohorts will
head down that road with some pretty impressive numbers themselves.
	   In a preliminary sale to officials, players, coaches and others
in the soccer community a year before kickoff, the tournament sold
115,000 tickets, more than the total for the last Women's World Cup
in Sweden in 1995.
	   With sellouts expected in big stadiums for all the games
featuring the U.S. Olympic champions, as well as the quarterfinals,
semifinals and championship game in the Rose Bowl July 10,
organizers expect between 500,000 and 700,000 tickets to be sold,
with a worldwide TV audience of 1 billion.
	   Placed beside the 3.5 million tickets sold for the men's World
Cup in 1994, that figure looks small. But Alan Rothenberg, the
president of U.S. Soccer and chief organizer of the 1994 Cup, noted
that all games except the semifinals will be played as part of
double-headers, and the field of 16 teams is half the size of the
men's. Overseas teams also are expected to attract smaller groups
of traveling fans, he said.
	   Women's soccer has exploded in the decade since FIFA, the
sport's international federation, decided to stage an experimental
tournament. It's become especially big in the United States, where
women and girls make up 40 percent of the 18.2 million people who
play the game.
	   U.S. women won the first World Cup in 1991 and the first women's
Olympic soccer gold medal in 1996. That tournament attracted
records crowd and, along with the success of other women's teams,
set the stage for next year _ and years to come.
	   ``We did this because it was the right thing to do for our
players. We had an obligation to them,'' said Hank Steinbrecher,
U.S. Soccer executive director. ``And we did it because we had an
obligation to women of our country, to help the country deal with
gender-equity issues.''
	   That message, hopefully, will be carried to other countries,
organizers said.
	   ``We see it as opening the door, not just for women's football
but for women's sports in general,'' Messing said. ``People will
see and want to participate in their own countries.''

World Cup: Japan plans to take it easy ahead of Argentina game
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Japanese coach Takeshi Okada is so
happy with his team World Cup buildup he's giving the players an
easy time in the last few days.
	   The squad leaves this resort that is their training camp Friday
for Toulouse, where their game against Argentina is set for Sunday.
	   ``It's better to keep things down and move up the energy level
for the game,'' Okada said. ``I feel I can face the game knowing
that I've done all that I thought needed to be done.''
	   Japan's last few practices have been closed to the public and
reporters, carried out in a field surrounded by high walls.
	   Thursday's closed practice was devoted to working together
against heavy pressure form the opposing team, said Okada, 41.
	   ``I'm impressed with my players,'' he said.
	   Team captain Masami Ihara said his right knee injury that had
kept him out of a couple of warmup matches had healed almost
completely.
	   ``I'm well,'' he said. Like the rest of his team, he felt
completely relaxed, the 30-year-old defender said.
	   ``I don't feel any different. Maybe it won't hit until I stand
on the field,'' Ihara said. ``There's no point in panicking if
we've come this far.''
	   Okada said he was definitely not losing any sleep over his
Argentine foes.
	   ``There hasn't been a single night I haven't slept well,'' he
said. ``This is so big, the only way to think is, well, what the
heck.''
	   He was, however, thinking about his pep talk for the players.
	   ``After all, it's our first game in our first World Cup,'' Okada
said. ``I realize I have to come up with something impressive.''

<TEXT>
	   CHAVAJEVAL, Mexico (AP) _ The police and soldiers were gone from
this Indian village, and dozens men in Zapatista rebel uniforms
patrolled the town's square, some with assault rifles.
	   The evidence of a clash between the army and rebels Wednesday
was everywhere _ smashed desks in the farm hall, the ransacked
interior of the town store, an ample smearing of blood on the
concrete floor of the health clinic.
	   Although the government has said its troops were fired upon as
they entered the village, residents said Thursday that the army
rolled in shooting tear gas and mortars, and that residents
responded with gunfire only then.
	   Nine people were killed _ including one policeman _ and up to
nine were injured before the troops withdrew Wednesday afternoon.
Four of the seven wounded policemen were in serious condition
Thursday, said Omar Gonzalez, director of the September 14th
Hospital in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the state capital.
	   It was among the deadliest clashes since the rebels' January
1994 uprising for Indian rights and greater democracy.
	   Some villagers said the army chased residents into the lush
green hills surrounding the village. No women or children could be
seen here on Thursday.
	   ``All the government gives us is gunshots,'' said a man dressed
in a Zapatista uniform and carrying a rifle, who gave his name as
Adolfo Lopez Mateos _ the name of a former Mexican president.
	   He, like the other uniformed men, would not identify themselves
as Zapatistas _ or say who they were at all. ``There's no uniform
here,'' Lopez Mateos said, like the others wearing the rebels'
typical dark brown shirt, charcoal gray pants and sturdy hiking
boots, a blue ski mask tucked into his belt.
	   Some of the men carried AK-47s; others smaller rifles. Some
carried mock weapons made of wood, of the type that Zapatistas use
to train recruits.
	   Wednesday's clash appears to have been the first direct
confrontation between government forces and Zapatista rebels in
years, and some analysts said it could signal a new willingness on
the part of the government to use force to crush rebel support.
	   ``Since public opinion is in favor of negotiating an end to the
Chiapas conflict, the government has decided to use force without
saying so,'' said Lorenzo Meyer, a prominent academic in Mexico
City. ``If the Mexican people don't react strongly, the government
will continue.''
	   Emilio Rabasa Gamboa, the government's chief negotiator,
stressed Thursday that the raid on Chavajeval in no way signifies a
breaking of the truce in Chiapas.
	   Rabasa, speaking after a meeting with Interior Secretary
Francisco Labastida Ochoa in Mexico City, said that rather than
begin dialogue with the government, the Zapatista rebels had chosen
to maintain a silence ``which I believe has a high cost.''
	   A leader of the Zapatistas' civilian wing, Javier Elorriaga, had
predicted such an attack days earlier, saying it would coincide
with the soccer World Cup, which began Wednesday.
	   ``With the World Cup, people forget what's happening in the
country,'' he told The Associated Press. ``Those are the moments in
which the government does its most shameless deeds.''
	   The signs of the clash were everywhere in Chavajeval, a remote
Tzotzil Indian hamlet 25 miles (40 kms) north of the city of San
Cristobal, on the side of a canyon covered in lush vegetation.
	   In the village's health clinic, three young men lounged on metal
cots without mattresses. On the floor beside them was a large
quantity of smeared dried blood.
	   Many villagers said the soldiers had looted stores and houses
during their raids.
	   The door of the Sanchez family's store had been ripped off and
stood on its side, half blocking the entry. Inside, bags of corn
were scattered on the floor amid empty soda bottles, beans and
human excrement.
	   Domingo Sanchez, 18, leaned against the door. ``Who will pay for
this?'' he asked.
	   Up the hill, in the municipal seat of El Bosque, a banner hung
from the town hall: ``The residents of El Bosque thank you Mr.
Governor for your support in restoring the state of law.''
	   About a dozen state policemen carrying automatic rifles
patrolled the rooftop and around the doors of the building.
	   Overall, 56 people were arrested Wednesday on charges including
homicide, causing injuries, robbery and usurping government
authority. Most had their preliminary court appearances Thursday
and pleaded innocent.

	   PARIS (AP) _ A year before the first kickoff, the Women's World
Cup in the United States is proving to be a success at the gate.
	   Organizers said Thursday that a preliminary sale to officials,
players, coaches and other soccer-community members had reached
115,000 tickets, more than the total sale for the last women's
tournament in Sweden in 1995.

of capacity for the tournament, which is scheduled for eight U.S.

	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Takeshi Okada is asked often
whether he will still be Japan's coach when the next World Cup
rolls around, when his nation co-hosts with South Korea the
tournament's debut in Asia.
	   ``This is not the kind of job that's good for your health to
keep for too long,'' Okada, 41, said earlier this week. ``And all
that will depend on the results of this World Cup.''
	   ``My contract is only until the end of July, so I will think
about it after that,'' he said.
	   Okada rose to head coach when his predecessor, Shu Kamo, was
dismissed in October 1997.
	   Already a national hero, Okada has led his team to a dramatic
turnaround that brought Japan to its first ever World Cup berth.
Under his leadership, Japan had three wins, two draws and no losses
during qualifiers. If the team keeps it up, Japanese soccer fans
are likely to demand Okada back at the next World Cup, whether he
likes it or not.

	   NICE, France (AP) _ Matthias Sammer, the injured German sweeper,
will not be coming to France for the World Cup after all, even as a
spectator, at least not during the first round.
	   Sammer, who is recovering from his fifth surgery on his left
knee, had to be dropped from Germany's roster. But coach Berti
Vogts told Sammer he could come and stay with the team during the
World Cup.
	   Instead, Sammer decided to stay home and work on his fitness
program, team spokesman Wolfgang Niersbach said Thursday. Sammer
may come and for a game or two in the later stages, Niersbach said.

	   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France (AP) _ Families of the U.S. team
members will arrive in the country this weekend, joining players
Saturday night and Sunday as the team moves its training camp to
Paris.
	   Unlike other coaches, coach Steve Sampson has no concerns about
players spending time with thier wives.
	   ``When I give them time off with their families,'' he said,
``that's time off to do what they want with their families and
wives. That's their private business.''
	   Meanwhile, a visitor of a different kind visited the Americans
on Thursday.
	   A representative of the German team Borussia Moenchengladbach
dropped by to scout the players. Mike Becker, the agent for many
U.S. team members, is already in camp and hopes to work out new
deals with foreign clubs during the tournament.
	   If Eric Wynalda plays well, he hopes to switch to an English or
Spanish team after the Major League Soccer season. Also, defender
Eddie Pope has sparked the interest of several European teams.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Now that his absence from the current World
Cup is a reality, former U.S. team captain John Harkes has set his
sights on the 2002 World Cup.
	   ``I just turned 31. There's nothing wrong with me shooting for
2002. Why not?,'' said Harkes, who pointed out that the man who
replaced him as captain, Thomas Dooley, is 37.
	   It was just two months ago that U.S. coach Steve Sampson
unceremoniously dumped Harkes after the two clashed over issues
both on the field and off. Harkes, a veteran of the 1990 and 1994
World Cups, had been on the U.S. team for 11 years.
	   ``It's a bitter pill to swallow,'' Harkes said.
	   While his former teammates make their final preparations for
Monday's opener against Germany in Paris, Harkes was making a
promotional appearance at a French restaurant in Washington.
	   ``It's very difficult, because basically I should be out there
preparing right now for the game against Germany,'' Harkes said.
	   Harkes signed autographs and watched the Cameroon-Austria game
on television with fans in the Les Halles restaurant's newly
christened World Cup viewing lounge.
	   Harkes plays for the two-time Major League Soccer champion D.C
United, has his fans.
	   Harkes said he is still rooting for his former teammates, but
there is clearly no love lost between Sampson and Harkes.
	   ``That was Steve's decision, although a very bad one. I think it
could have been handled a lot better anyway, more professionally,''
Harkes said.

Council concerned about reported demarcation line comments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council expressed concern
Thursday over reported remarks by Iraq's vice president that a
post-Gulf War demarcation of the border with Kuwait had no legal
standing.
	   Ambassador Antonio Monteiro of Portugal, the current council
president, said the 15-member council was ``strongly concerned''
about statements ``calling into question Security Council
resolution 833'' which demarcated the border.
	   Iraqi vice president, Taha Yassin Ramadan, was reported to have
told a group of Arab journalists last week in the Moroccan capital
Rabat that a U.N. resolution ``that demarcated the border between
Iraq and Kuwait does not have any legal value.'' He said the United
Nations has no mandate to fix borders of its member states.
	   The remarks were published last Thursday by Abu Dhabi's
Al-Ittihad newspaper.

Security Council concerned about settlement in east Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council said Thursday it was
concerned about a decision by Israel to approve new construction
for homes in disputed east Jerusalem and renewed calls for an end
to the tensions.
	   The Israeli interior ministry on Tuesday approved plans by a
yeshiva to build 58 Jewish homes on land that had originally been
set aside for an Arab girls' school.
	   ``The Security Council expressed concern about events reported
and renews its support for the efforts to bring the two parties to
resume the peace process,'' council president Antonio Monteiro of
Portugal said in a statement.
	   The 15-member council issued the statement after considering a
letter from the Palestinian U.N. representative, Nasser al-Kidwa,
seeking council action.
	   In the letter, al-Kidwa called the decision by the Israeli
interior ministry ``yet another example of the pursuit by the
government of Israel of an intensified expansionist policy for the
colonization and judaization of Arab Jerusalem.''

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council strongly condemned
the coup attempt in Guinea-Bissau and called Thursday for the quick
restoration of order to prevent further bloodshed.
	   ``The Security Council stresses that within a democracy,
disputes should only be settled in compliance with democratic
principles and calls for the early restoration of normal and
constitutional dialogue within the country,'' the council
president, Antonio Monteiro of Portugal, said in a statement.
	   The statement came as fighting raged in the capital of the
former Portuguese colony between renegade soldiers and government
troops. Rebels led by former armed forces chief Brig. Gen. Ansumane
Mane launched a coup attempt on Sunday.
	   ``The Security Council strongly condemns the attempted military
coup by some elements of the armed forces against the duly elected
democratic institutions and representatives of Guinea-Bissau,''
Monteiro said.
	   He added that the 15-member council commended efforts by the
government ``to avoid any further loss of civilian lives and to
assure the protection of foreign citizens'' and international aid
workers.

Philippine kidnappers free foreign exchange trader after 226 days
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ILIGAN, Philippines (AP) _ Kidnappers freed a businessman from
226 days of captivity Friday after his family was able to raise the
money for his ransom, the army said.
	   Police said foreign exchange dealer Richard Rivera was kidnapped
Oct. 29 in Iligan city in the southern Philippines by suspected
former Muslim rebels who turned to banditry to raise funds.
	   Rivera said he was transferred from place to place during the
first few weeks of his kidnapping but then kept in one place for
the remaining time. He said he was blindfolded and his hands were
tied throughout his captivity.
	   The kidnappers initially demanded 2 million pesos (dlrs 50,000)
in ransom. A military officer, who asked not to be named, said the
ransom amount was lowered to 1.3 million pesos (dlrs 32,500), but
it took Rivera's family several months to raise the money.
	   He was freed on the outskirts of Marawi city in Lanao del Sur
province, the military said.
	   Kidnappings for ransom, often of wealthy traders, are rampant
nationwide. Muslim guerrillas and criminals with links to police
and military officials are blamed for most of the kidnappings.

Year of Tiger becomes Year of Recession for Asia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to show in 3rd graf that this is first year
sted first quarter of negative growth for Japan.
 &UR; AP Graphic ASIA RECESSIONS &QL; 
 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Year of the Tiger, according
to Chinese superstition, can bring ferocious upheaval.
	   Six months into this tiger year, the once roaring Asian
economies have experienced plenty of that. Several have fallen
deeper into recession, a half dozen are slumping in that direction.
	   With Japan expected to announce its first year of negative
growth in two decades Friday, the deflation of Asia's economic role
model could push its proteges over the edge.
	   ``The announcement will have a negative impact,'' said Rajeev
Malik, regional economist at Jardine Fleming International
Securities in Singapore. ``I think the most immediate is likely to
be felt in the currency markets.''
	   Tokyo's announcement will come in the wake of Wednesday's
sell-off in Asian stock markets and currency markets, which plunged
after the U.S. dollar climbed to a seven-year high against the
bellwether yen.
	   Economic confidence in Asia generally suffers when the yen takes
a beating, even though regional currencies may not be directly
pegged to it.
	   The first of the Asian dominoes to fall, Thailand has been in
recession since last year, when its economy shrank by 0.4 percent,
compared to 5.5 percent growth in 1996.
	   Next was Indonesia, also in full-blown recession. Before the
deadly student riots last month that led to the fall of President
Suharto, analysts were already predicting an economic contraction
of 10 percent. Some are now forecasting negative growth of 25
percent this year.
	   Market analysts also put South Korea in recession. The Korean
economy is expected to shrink by more than 1 percent this year,
which would be the first contraction since 1980.
	   Hong Kong's economy eroded by 2 percent in the quarter ending in
March, the first negative growth in 13 years.
	   Malaysia and Singapore are both denying they're headed toward
recession, if you go by the standard definition of a recession: two
consecutive quarters of contracting growth.
	   Some economists say you can't always use this yardstick because
the growth rates in some countries, such as Malaysia, have been so
high.
	   ``When your economy slows down from 8 percent to 1 or 2 percent
that is, for all practical purposes, a recession,'' Malik said.
	   Malaysia's central bank announced last month that gross domestic
product shrank by 1.8 percent in the first quarter, the first
quarterly contraction since the mid-1980s.
	   Chia Yew Boon, research director at Singapore-based Santander
Investment Securities, said a policy split within government has
created uncertainty that is hurting Malaysia's chances of quick
recovery. Chia expects the economy to shrink by 3.8 percent this
year, compared with economic growth of 7.8 percent in 1997.
	   While Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has called loudly for
lower interest rates to help troubled businesses, the central bank
and Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who is also finance
minister, are adamant about keeping interest rates at current
levels.
	   Bruce Gale, regional manager of the Hong Kong-based Political &AMP;
Economic Risk Consultancy, said the expected announcement by
Tokyo's Economic Planning Agency on Friday could badly bruise
Singapore and Malaysia.
	   ``Malaysia's been very much looking to Japan to be a leader in
the region and to help Malaysia out with some of its short-term
financing,'' Gale said.
	   Mahathir returned last Friday from Tokyo and said he expected to
get dlrs 1-2 billion worth of loans in yen, a prospect made less
likely if Japan tightens its financial belt.
	   Singapore's growth for the first quarter of 1998 was 5.6
percent, but the figure is considered artificial because the first
quarter of 1997 was unusually depressed.
	   ``Singapore is highly vulnerable despite its good economic
management,'' said Gale. ``It's extremely vulnerable to a downturn
in trade, which is going to result from the negative growth in
Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand.''
	   The Philippines has escaped the worst of the Asian crisis.
Though economic growth slowed this first quarter to 2.5 percent
from 5.4 percent, no recession is expected.
	   Bitter enemies China and Taiwan have also stayed afloat amid the
sinking economies. Taiwan is predicting GDP growth of 6 percent
this year, down only 0.8 percent from last year.
	   China's Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng said Tuesday that
currency devaluations in Southeast Asian countries had weakened the
competitiveness of China's exports, but that China hoped to
maintain its 8-percent growth prediction for the year.
	   Economist Malik doesn't believe the smaller Asian economies can
do much to save themselves. He believes they need a comprehensive
debt-relief package similar to that in Latin America in the 1980s.
	   ``Debt forgiveness is what these countries need,'' he said.
``Short of insuring transparency and eliminating policy
contradictions, there is very little these countries can do on
their own.''

Report: Police say opposition gatherings are seditious
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian police have said that
public gatherings by opposition groups are not permitted because
they would discuss seditious issues and question the nation's
judiciary, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   A meeting of the main opposition group, the Democratic Action
Party, was disbanded by police Wednesday night because some
speakers had ridiculed the judiciary, Police Spokesman Ghazali Amin
was quoted as saying by Friday's Star newspaper.
	   ``The police view cases under the Sedition Act very seriously as
the existence of this act is to prevent any hostility and disorder
in a multi-racial society like Malaysia,'' he said.
	   ``The issues raised also discredited the integrity of the
judiciary. The issues have a seditions tendency and can be
classified under Section 3(1)(c) of the Sedition Act 1948,'' said
another police official, Yaacob M. Amin.
	   Despite the police ban, Malaysia's main opposition party has
vowed to press ahead with meetings.
	   Four party leaders, including deputy secretary general Lim Guan
Eng, were briefly arrested at Wednesday's dinner meeting.
	   The gathering was organized to generate sympathy for Lim, who
recently received two concurrent 18-month jail sentences for
sedition and violating a publishing act. He is appealing against
the convictions.
	   It was the fourth time in two weeks that police have broken up
opposition gatherings, prompting accusations of a clampdown on free
speech.
	   But authorities have denied there was a blanket ban saying these
meeting were not permitted because they could have jeopardized
public peace and security.

East Timorese protesters invade Indonesian Foreign Ministry

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 100 East Timorese protesters
invaded Indonesia's Foreign Ministry on Friday, demanding
independence and the release of an imprisoned rebel leader.
	   Witnesses said they arrived in buses chanting slogans and waving
banners. They then entered its main building unchallenged and sat
in the lobby.
	   Several senior officials were expected to meet the group.
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas was not in the country.
	   About 20 police were at the scene but took no action.
	   The demonstration is the latest in a series of rallies and
marches in the capital.
	   Former President Suharto resigned last month after a wave of
protests and riots. Protests have flared again since his successor
B.J. Habibie promised sweeping reforms, but at a moderate pace.
	   Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
annexed it a year later as its 27th province.
	   Since then separatists have staged a guerrilla war against
Indonesian troops who have been accused of human rights abuses.
	   The spotlight went back on the future of the disputed territory
when Suharto quit. The former autocrat, who ruled Indonesia for 32
years and who ordered the 1975 invasion, had refused to make
concessions toward East Timor despite calls from the international
community.
	   Earlier this week new head of state Habibie said East Timor must
remain an integral part of Indonesia. However, he was willing to
grant special status to the half-island territory in exchange for
peace.
	   Habibie also announced that the government would release 15 East
Timorese political prisoners.
	   However, he said that jailed guerrilla commander Xanana Gusmao
must remain behind bars.
	   Separatists regard Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year sentence in
Jakarta's Cipinang Prison, as a freedom fighter. However, Indonesia
has branded him a violent criminal.
	   On Wednesday several thousand East Timorese staged a rally
rejecting Habibie's peace offering and demanded that a referendum
be held on the question of independence.

Twelve East Timorese political prisoners leave jail

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Shouting pro-independence slogans and
clutching their belongings in plastic bags, a dozen pardoned
political prisoners walked out of a jail Friday in the
Indonesian-controlled territory of East Timor.
	   ``Viva East Timor,'' they chanted, vowing to continue their
quest for a country independent from Indonesia, which invaded the
former Portuguese colony in 1975 and annexed it a year later.
	   In Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, about 100 East Timorese
protesters demanding a vote on self-determination, arrived in buses
at the foreign ministry, chanting and waving banners.
	   President B.J. Habibie, who is pursuing an agenda of democratic
reform, signed a decree for the release of the prisoners earlier
this week. Many are students who were arrested last year for
demonstrating against Indonesian authority.
	   ``This freedom (is) good for our struggle. It's a victory for
us,'' said Tomas Augusto Correia, a 33-year-old municipal worker
who was among the detainees.
	   On Thursday, the prisoners refused to leave Becora prison on the
outskirts of Dili, the capital of East Timor, saying they also
wanted freedom for Xanana Gusmao, the jailed separatist rebel
chief.
	   But they agreed to leave after regaling wardens with a litany of
complaints, ranging from the poor quality of prison food to
military repression. Most were serving one- or two-year sentences,
and some were due to leave jail in coming days.
	   In a brief ceremony in a cramped prison office, the warden shook
hands with one of the prisoners and handed him his release form to
a smattering of applause.
	   In silence, the inmates then unveiled a banner with slogans
denouncing the presence of the Indonesian military in East Timor
and demanding the release of Gusmao.
	   Arrested in 1992, Gusmao is serving a 20-year sentence in
Cipinang jail in Jakarta, 2,240 kilometers (1,400 miles) west of
East Timor.
	   The government has yet to give a clear signal on how it plans to
handle the charismatic Gusmao. He is beloved by thousands of East
Timorese who see him as a symbol of resistance, but the Indonesian
military has said he is a criminal, not a political prisoner.
	   The Indonesian military has been accused of widespread abuses in
East Timor, bringing international condemnation. At the same time,
the government has pumped resources into the development of the
poor and rugged half-island territory of 800,000 people.
	   A justice ministry told the newly released prisoners that the
government was committed to releasing more political detainees but
warned them that as free men, they were not above the law.
	   Filing through the prison door, the prisoners said they planned
to resume their political activities.
	   ``We want total independence,'' 20-year-old Bendito Amoral said
before catching a bus.

Expos end Yankees' winning streak; Mets down Marlins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be updated with late games &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ The New York Yankees' nine-game winning streak
ended Thursday night when the Montreal Expos took advantage of an
apparent injury to pitcher Andy Pettitte and rallied for seven runs
in the seventh inning for a 7-5 victory.
	   Vladimir Guerrero began the Expos' outburst with a double and
capped it with a three-run double. Montreal came back against five
pitchers, making the Yankees the last team in the majors to lose an
interleague game this season.
	   Pettitte took a 5-0 lead into the seventh. But Guerrero led off
with a double and scored when Rondell White followed with a double,
with second baseman Chuck Knoblauch mishandling the relay for an
error.
	   Yankees manager Joe Torre immediately came to the mound and,
after a brief discussion with Pettitte, took out the left-hander.
Reliever Mike Stanton was given as much time as he needed to warm
up.
	   There was no immediate word on the nature of Pettitte's
problem.
 &UR; Mets 5, Marlins 3 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Bobby Jones won his fifth straight decision, Mike
Piazza homered and Edgardo Alfonzo drove in the go-ahead run as the
New York Mets beat the Florida Marlins.
	   Jones (6-3) allowed three runs and seven hits in seven innings,
and John Franco pitched the ninth for his 14th save.
	   Alfonzo's RBI single in the seventh broke a 3-3 tie, and Brian
McRae added a solo homer in the ninth as the the Mets won for the
16th time in 22 games.
	   Piazza, who played five games with the Marlins before being
traded to the Mets on May 22, tied the game 3-3 with a solo homer
in the fifth. It was Piazza's third homer for the Mets and 12th of
the season.

U.S. dollar surges against yen, Tokyo stocks fall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with late-morning trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar surged to a nearly eight-year high
against the yen Friday morning as traders bet that major central
banks won't intervene to support the yen. Tokyo stock prices
continued to slide.
	   The dollar bought 144.21 yen in early trading, up 2.53 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
143.79 yen overnight.
	   At one point, the dollar moved as high as 144.75 yen in Tokyo,
matching its most recent previous high on August 30, 1990.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
shed 148.06 points, or 0.99 percent, to 14,865.98 points at the
close of the morning session. On Thursday, the average closed down
325.22 points, or 2.12 percent.
	   The Nikkei index last traded below 15,000 points on Jan. 14.
	   Traders interpreted comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin overnight in Washington as meaning that a coordinated effort
by central banks to boost the falling yen was unlikely.
	   Rubin, testifying before the Senate Finance Committee on
Thursday, reiterated that Japan must revive its ailing economy,
warning that ``Japan's economic difficulties and weak currency are
having substantial adverse impact on the East Asian countries.''
	   Rubin also said it will be up to Japan to halt the yen's slide.
	   In Tokyo, Japanese finance minister Hikaru Matsunaga said Friday
that Japan was ready to take decisive action against an excessive
weakening of the yen.
	   He said Japan's partners from the Group of Seven nations were
also ready to cooperate on such action.
	   ``The G-7 said at their April Washington meeting that they are
ready to communicate and cooperate if there is a sharp change in
foreign exchange,'' he told a regular press conference.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said Friday morning he does not
think the dollar at 144 yen reflects Japanese economic
fundamentals.
	   ``The fact that a situation like this continues shows that the
U.S. isn't interested in talking about current account balance
issues,'' Hashimoto told reporters.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange fell 10.45 points, or 0.89 percent,
to 1,1768.36 points. The TOPIX closed down 19.79 points, or 1.65
percent, the day before.
	   Market sentiment was weak because of the yen's sharp fall and
its negative impact on other Asian economies, traders said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.260 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.245 percent, driving its price down to 111.57 yen from 111.68
yen.

Arrojo's family defects from Cuba to join him
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIMMY GOLEN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ It was an hour after his last outing when Rolando
Arrojo got the call he hadn't permitted himself to hope for: His
family was free, escaping Cuba to join him in the United States.
	   Arrojo's mother spent 12 hours floating in the Caribbean along
with his brother, his sister-in-law and their two kids, ages 8 and
13. He had not seen them since he defected in 1996, and he had no
reason to believe that he ever would.
	   ``It was a surprise,'' Arrojo, speaking through an interpreter,
said Thursday. ``In Cuba, when you're going to do this, you don't
tell anyone because it's very dangerous. In Cuba, nobody talks
about it. They're afraid if they say that over the phone, somebody
will listen.''
	   After receiving the news on Saturday night, Arrojo got
permission to leave the team. Too excited to think straight, he
drove, rather than flew, to Miami, where his relatives were being
held at the Krome Detention Center.
	   He was able to spend only an hour with them, so he has few
details about their journey. ``He only knows they had a tough time,
like everyone who comes from Cuba,'' interpreter Carlos Ledezma,
the team's equipment manager, reported.
	   Sitting in a room at the Devil Rays' team hotel with music
wafting in from the piano bar in the lobby, Arrojo was clearly
relieved to be delivered from this worry. After all, it was his
defection in 1996 that cost his brother his job as a baseball
coach, along with other retaliation that his mother was too
protective to tell him about.
	   ``His mother is very supportive of him. She didn't want any
worries,'' Ledezma said. ``When he called to Cuba, she always
brought the positive, that everything was fine.
	   But, he said, ``They treat them like garbage. So it was not good
treatment.''
	   Arrojo, who defected from the Cuban national team on a
pre-Olympic tour, rejoined the Devil Rays in Boston on Thursday. He
is scheduled to start against the Red Sox on Friday.
	   ``He will be more relaxed because he doesn't have any more
worries,'' Ledezma translated. ``But always the game is No. 1 with
him. He doesn't have any distractions.''
	   Arrojo has been the expansion Devil Rays' best pitcher this
season, with an 8-3 record with a 3.50 ERA in 13 starts. He is
among the early candidates for AL Rookie of the Year honors.

Colombia's head coach says his team lacks a champion's mindset
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAIRO ANCHIQUE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOUR-DU-PIN, France (AP) - They've got talent, they've got
style. All that's keeping Colombia from a world title is a
champion's mindset.
	   ``I wonder if the team will be 100 percent mentally. One day
we're up, then we're down,'' says head coach Hernan Dario Gomez of
the talented but inconsistent Colombians.
	   ``If this team had the Argentines' mentality, it would be world
champion,'' says Gomez. Argentina, also playing in France '98, has
two world titles.
	   Colombia has been troubled by recent losses in the run-up to the
World Cup, as well as by death threats against Gomez and at least
one team member.
	   The Colombians make their Cup debut against Romania Monday in
Lyon in Group G, which includes England and Tunisia.
	   Still fresh on the minds of the Colombians is their inaugural
game defeat to the Romanians in USA '94. And while some players say
revenge is the main objective, others urge caution.
	   ``If we focus on taking revenge next Monday, we'll lose,'' said
veteran midfielder Freddy Rincon. ``This is a new chance, a
different tournament.''
	   But, Adolfo Valencia, a veteran of the team that lost in the
United States, sees things differently. ``There is an unpaid
debt,'' says the flashy forward of Italy's Parma.
	   Gomez, meanwhile, says the team needs to concentrate on the task
at hand: keep it simple, advance to the second round.
	   ``They're a very quick and practical team,'' Gomez said of
Romania. ``They get ready quickly and constantly attack from
outside the area.''
	   ``We have to make sure we don't play their running game. We'll
play our slow game, we'll try to control the ball, and if we're
able to finetune our shooting, we'll be evenly matched.''
	   Gomez has promised a ``big surprise'' in the lineup for the
first match and it could well be having Jorge Bermudez playing
sweeper.
	   ``Jorge has improved his game. He's a leader with experience and
he's strong,'' Gomez said. ``We're watching him closely.''
	   Bermudez, who plays for Boca Juniors of Argentina, has been
replaced as a starter by Everth Palacios, of Atletico Medellin of
the Colombian league.
	   But there have been other interesting changes in the practice
lineups and it's not clear if Bermudez is the big surprise promised
by Gomez.
	   In today's morning session, forward Valencia, of Italy's Parma,
reeplaced striker Faustino Asprilla in the ``A'' team, with the
latter moving to the ``B'' squad. Valencia, of Independiente of
Argentina, briefly took over Victor Hugo Arisistabal's starting
spot in Wednesday practice.

South Korea's richest man to visit North Korea with 500 cows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's richest man plans to
herd 500 cows into hunger-stricken North Korea next week in a
gesture of generosity aimed at improving relations between these
two bitter rivals.
	   Chung Ju-yung, owner of the giant Hyundai group, is to drive the
cattle through Panmunjom, the tiny truce village in the center of
the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone that separates the two
Koreas, a South Korean official said.
	   The South Korean government said that both it and North Korea
have approved Chung's visit, which begins Thursday.
	   Barring last-minute hitches, the cows will be given to North
Korea to help ease a food shortage in the reclusive communist
state. Chung will then spend eight days looking into business
opportunities in the North.
	   It will be Chung's second visit to North Korea, where he was
born 82 years ago. He visited his hometown in 1989 and agreed to
several joint venture business projects, including a ship repair
yard.
	   Unification Ministry officials said Chung will cross the border
along with eight family members. The cows will be transported on 50
Hyundai trucks.
	   The cows are part of a gift Chung has promised to give North
Korea in return for his visit. He gave the North 10,000 tons of
corn in May and is committed to ship an additional 500 cows and
40,000 tons of corn later this year.
	   Chung will be the first South Korean civilian to visit North
Korea via Panmunjom, where the truce was signed that ended the
1950-53 Korean War.
	   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945. Their border is the most heavily
fortified in the world, with nearly 2 million troops deployed on
both sides.
	   Seoul government officials said they authorized Chung's visit
under President Kim Dae-jung's ``sunshine policy,'' which calls for
engaging North Korea rather than isolating it.
	   The Seoul government is prodding the United States to follow
suit in easing economic sanctions and allowing free trade and
investment in North Korea.

Most suspects released in clash that killed 11 in Mexican
</HEADLINE>
schoolhouse &QL; 
 &UR; With Mexico-Chiapas &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ Mexican prosecutors are filing charges
against only two of the 27 people arrested after a clash that
killed 11 members of a guerrilla group in the southwestern state of
Guerrero.
	   The other 25 people were released Thursday afternoon.
	   The attorney general's office said Wednesday that the leftist
Popular Revolutionary Army, known by its Spanish initials as the
EPR, was holding a recruitment meeting Sunday at a schoolhouse in
the hamlet of El Charco, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) west of
Acapulco, when they surprised by army troops.
	   All 11 people killed were active members of the EPR, but others
inside the building apparently did not belong to the group, it
said.
	   Charges were filed against two people who authorities said
admitted to being EPR members. Ericka Zamora Pardo, 21, and Efren
Gomez Chavez, 25, were charged with rebellion, arms violations and
organized crime.
	   The battle was one of two major clashes this week involving
guerrilla groups in Mexico. On Wednesday, fighting between
Zapatista rebels and police and soldiers in the southern state of
Chiapas killed nine people, including a police officer.
