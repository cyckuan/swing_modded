<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial on Arts Festival (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial says that continuous development of arts and
literature will enable the Chinese people to join the mankind's
march towards a better civilization.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the Party's 15th national congress, Jiang
Zemin said that "constructing socialism with Chinese
characteristics requires that we pay special attention to
improving the nation's ideological and moral quality, as well as
the scientific and cultural quality. We must provide strong
spiritual motivation and intellectual support for our country's
economic development and overall social development. We must
educate generations of citizens with ideals, morality, culture and
discipline suited to the modernization of socialism.
</P>
<P>
"This will be a protracted and heavy task," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Working steadily towards this goal is the noble duty of all
literary and art workers, says the editorial.
</P>
<P>
"We must uphold the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, and
implement the Party's literary and art policies. We must mix with
the masses in order to learn their historic creation and spiritual
progress in order to ensure our work benefits the grand cause of
constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics."
</P>
<P>
Literary and art prosperity and development cannot be achieved
without reforming operational mechanisms. We will uphold the fine
tradition of our national culture, absorb the positive aspects of
foreign cultures, and try to produce even more creative and
artistic works, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The China Arts Festival is regarded as an opportunity to
accelerate the development of the country's literary and art
cause.

<HEADLINE> Russia Unveils Stealth Fighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Major newspapers here today
unveiled Russia's own version of stealth fighter plane and claimed
it to be superior over its top U.S. counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The radar-evading craft, known as the S-37 Berkut, or Golden
Eagle, is 22.6 meters long, with the span of its wings, which are
pointed backwards, measuring 16.7 meters.
</P>
<P>
Powered by two engines and with take-off weight of 24 metric
tons, it can fly at a maximum speed of over 2,200 kilometers per
hour with excellent maneuverability.
</P>
<P>
The new fighter, developed by the Sukhoi design and production
complex, reportedly carried out a series of successful test
flights near Moscow last month.
</P>
<P>
Kommersant and Nezavisimaya, two Russian dailies, said the S-37
is more agile than the F-22 Raptor, an experimental U.S. stealth
fighter, in a dogfight.
</P>
<P>
However, while the F-22, unveiled in September, is expected to
enter the U.S. Air Force early next century, the fate of the S-37
is yet to be decided.

<HEADLINE> ARATS Issues Letter to Taiwan Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) today sent a dispatch to the
Taiwan Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) concerning a recent
incident involving mainland fishermen and Taiwan armed police.
</P>
<P>
The letter noted that the cause of the incident concerning the
fishing boat Fujian-4418 centered on the fact that Taiwan armed
police unjustifiably seized and fired on mainland fishermen, who
were in turn forced to defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
Zhuang Zhenyue, a Taiwan armed policeman taken into custody by
the fishermen, has basically recovered thanks to medical care of
the relevant Fujian departments, and has made two telephone calls
to his family.
</P>
<P>
As part of an effort to avoid complications concerning the
incident and safeguard good relations across the Taiwan straits,
the departments concerned in Fujian Province have decided that
Zhuang should compensate for the Fujian fishermen's medical
expenses and economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Details related to compensation will be finalized by personnel
from the Fujian and Taiwan Red Cross organizations or other
non-governmental bodies. And the Fujian Red Cross Society will
arrange for Zhuang's return to Taiwan at the earliest possible
date.

<HEADLINE> NATO to Help Secure Bosnian Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization today confirmed that the NATO-led Stabilization Force
(SFOR) will provide the general security framework for the coming
Bosnian parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after the North Atlantic Council, the
executive body of the 16-nation alliance, consulted with the 20
non-NATO SFOR contributing countries on the issue.
</P>
<P>
A modest and temporary reinforcement of the stabilization force
was authorized in support of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe that is organizing and supervising the
Bosnian elections.
</P>
<P>
The security framework, similar to the one provided by the SFOR
during the September 13-14 Bosnian municipal elections, will be
conducted on a smaller scale via appropriate logistical and
communication support in that there will be fewer polling
stations.
</P>
<P>
In early September, the SFOR was reinforced with six more
battalions to a total of 40,000 troops and 12 more F-16 fighter
jets. Some of the troops were equipped with policing tools such as
batons, shields, tear gases and non-lethal grenades.
</P>
<P>
But a NATO spokesman said that this time the reinforcement
would be much smaller.

BONN, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in the western area of
Germany fell in October to an annualized rate of 1.7 percent from
1.8 percent in September, showed preliminary figures released

</P>
<P>
The conclusion was based on cost-of-living calculations in four

According to the statistics office, October prices were up 0.1
percent from August, when they rose sharply.

The mark's climbing strength against the U.S. dollar was the

<HEADLINE> Kohl Pledges Continued EU Support for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 24 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told
visiting Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat that Germany and the
European Union would continue their efforts to back Middle East
peace.
</P>
<P>
A statement by German government spokesman Herbert Schmuelling
said Kohl made the pledge during his talks with Arafat, and added
that Middle East peace could only be achieved "in a spirit of
mutual trust."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "both (leaders) expressed rising alarm over the
present situation regarding implementation of the Oslo peace
accord," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
But the statement mentioned no fresh German or EU initiatives
or any further German economic aid Palestinians hoped for.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources have said that Arafat's two-day visit was
aimed at gaining more aid and a tougher German stance regarding
the current Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had talks with Kohl after a breakfast meeting with
German parliamentary leader Rita Suessmuth.
</P>
<P>
Implying criticism of Israel's blocking aid for the
Palestinians, Suessmuth in a statement noted that it was vital for
international aid to reach the recipients in an "unbureaucratic
manner without hindrance."
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Bonn after a brief stopover in Paris Thursday
where he urged EU help to push forward his negotiations with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The key point was to talk Israel into implementing treaties
already signed, he told the press after talking with French
President Jacques Chirac. He noted that the recent U.S. mediated
contacts with Israel turned out to be "disappointing."
</P>
<P>
"We are counting on France and Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Bonn, Arafat will also meet with Economics
Minister Guenter Rexrodt, Finance Minister Theo Waigel and Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel.

EDINBURGH, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The 31st Commonwealth Heads
of Government Meeting (CHOGM) opened in Edinburgh this afternoon
with government leaders or their representatives from the
54-nation bloc expected to discuss trade cooperation and other
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, British Prime Minister Tony

new Labor government "would make a sustainable effort to give new
life to the Commonwealth."

<P>
Blair, who is also chairman of the four-day CHOGM, expressed
his conviction that the Edinburgh summit "will agree an economic

objectives."
</P>
<P>
"We should challenge the rest of the world to meet the dual
objectives of democratic and economic freedom together," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair also stressed that the Commonwealth "is needed more today
than at any time in its history" in a common effort to resolve the
problems of climate change, inequality, North-South differences
and debt burden.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister also voiced his hope that the
Commonwealth could work together over the next few days to "review
the ties of friendship and understanding that binds us" in a
common bid to build a Commonwealth for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the particular theme of "Trade, Investment and
Development: The Road to Commonwealth Prosperity," the
Commonwealth leaders will also discuss Nigeria's suspended
membership, the future role of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action
Group and the criteria for Commonwealth membership, according to

<HEADLINE> Israel, Lebanese Resistance Fight in Cyberspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Islamic Resistance's
war with Israel has spread from south Lebanon to Cyberspace while
its web site has come under fire from Israelis, a newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Naami, publicity director of the Islamic Resistance
Support Association, said that "They (Israelis) try to send a
virus to the page, a form of electronic detonation.
</P>
<P>
"They send a message millions of times which could take up all
our capacity," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star quoted Naami as saying that even e-mail
communication from Israel is full of curses and slanders instead
of peace calls.
</P>
<P>
"They are always cursing, very nasty," said Naami,"They
say:'We will kill you all, and your wives and children'."
</P>
<P>
He said that "There is no dialog. There isn't a struggle over
a piece of land, it is a clash of civilizations between Arab
civilization and Israeli civilization."
</P>
<P>
Licensed by the government, the web site has so far received
its 20,000th visitor since it was established in February
1996. Most inquiries come from Europe, America and Japan,
especially from expatriate Arab communities.
</P>
<P>
The web site offers statistics and a detailed day-to-day
chronicle of both Israeli attacks and operations carried out
by the resistance.
</P>
<P>
South Lebanon has been the last battle front between Israelis
and Arabs. Israel established a 1,100-square-kilometer security
zone there in 1985 to prevent cross-border attacks, while Islamic
guerrillas have been fighting to oust Israelis out of the area.

<HEADLINE> West African Health Organization to Be Formed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- West African countries will have
a sub-regional health organization, the West African Health
Organization (WAHO), by next year, said Nigerian Health Minister
Ihechukwu Madubuike.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Health Minister Ihechukwu Madubuike said on Thursday
in Abuja that WAHO will emerge from the merger of two existing
organizations, the West African Health Community and its
French-speaking counterpart, the Organisation de Co-ordination
pour la luttle Coutre less Grandes Endemies (OCCGE), Nigeria's
Daily Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The merger was decided in 1984 but have not be effected.
Madubuike blamed the delay on the linguistic and cultural
differences being exploited by colonial influences on the English
and French-speaking halves of the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The minsiter said WAHO would function as a specialized agency
of the top sub-regional body, the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) that will be devoted to the development
of the health sector in West Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to Madubuike, WAHO will be targeted for the highest
possible standards of health care delivery through harmonization
of policies, pooling of resources and co-operation among the
member states as a collective strategy to combat health problems
of the sub-region.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Why Does Nigeria Restate Pan-African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- As moves to obtain a seat in the
to-be-expanded United Nations Security Council already began
quietly, Nigeria has seized all chances to emphasize its leading
role in African and world affairs.
</P>
<P>
A senior foreign ministry official recently reiterated that
Nigeria had not changed from its Pan-African foreign policy to a
focus on the west African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Since Nigeria has been chairman of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) in the past two years, it has to pay
greater attention to the sub-region, said Jibrin Chinade,
Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
"With our head of state as chairman of ECOWAS in the past two
years, we have had a huge agenda of searching for permanent peace
in Liberia and now in Sierra Leone," he added.
</P>
<P>
It is noted that the official might want to remind the world
of the fact that Nigeria's concentration in Liberia, its sharing
of major human, financial and materials resources needed for the
peace process, has helped end the country's seven-year civil war
and establish a new elected government.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has also offered the bulk of the peacekeeping force now
operating at its own cost in Sierra Leone. And Nigerians are
proud of their contribution in peacekeeping missions worldwide.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinade, who is also Director-General of the
Foreign Ministry, Nigeria will continue to contribute to the
consolidation of the democratic process in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government also encourages the private sector's
involvement in the economic revival of that country.
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian private airline, Kabo, is now assisting the
Liberian authorities in establishing a national airline.
</P>
<P>
But all this can not be misunderstood as Nigeria's focus being
placed on the sub-region only, said Chinade who
also mentioned the country's recent diplomatic initiatives in the
East.
</P>
<P>
For some years, Nigeria has been suffering sanctions imposed
by the United States and some European countries for its poor
human rights situation. The Commonwealth has suspended the
country's membership for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
This has forced the country to expand its links with eastern
Europe and Asia for opportunities in foreign investment and
trade.
</P>
<P>
"These regions have the capital, they have the know-how and
indeed they have the market," Chinade said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the new direction of Nigeria's
foreign relations is hinged on the principle of economic
diplomacy that has been in effect for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The new direction, he stated, had already started to bear
fruit, with the Chinese getting involved in the rehabilitation of
the country's railway system, as well as going into joint
ventures in mining.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was also reaching out to Singapore, Indonesia and Hong
Kong to attract investment to the export processing zone in
Calabar, southeastern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"We are emphasizing our relations with these new regions of
the world for our mutual benefits," said Chinade, who might be
referring to calls from some opponents of the policy arguing
that Nigeria could not gain from the East what it loses in the
West.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Nigeria's relations with Western countries,
Chinade said the country was engaging them in dialogue as a way
of explaining its position on the issues of democracy and human
rights.
</P>
<P>
"We want as much democracy as they want. We want as much human
rights as they want. But they also have to understand our
peculiar situation, a temporary one for that matter," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM Arrives in Lebanon on Tough Mideast Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov arrived here this morning on a week-long Middle
East tour which aimed at strengthening Moscow's role in reviving
the stalemated Arab-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
Primakov held talks with his Lebanese counterpart Farez Boueiz
after his arrival. He will meet Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
later today.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Beirut Airport this morning, Primakov told
reporters that Lebanon is a very important country in the Middle
East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The peace process is undergoing difficulties, so it is
impossible to expect quick results from it, he added.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that he made the trip in line with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's drive for Russia, a co-sponsor of the
Mideast peace process along with the United States, to play an
influential role in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
His Mideast tour, which will also take him to Syria, Israel,
Ramallah on the West Bank, Jordan and Egypt, came after U.S. envoy
Dennis Ross' shuttle diplomacy to help revive the stalled peace
process.

<HEADLINE> EAC Sets to Revive Court of Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Francis Muthaura,
Executive Secretary of the East African Cooperation (EAC), has
said that arrangements were underway to revive the Court of
Appeal of East Africa.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of a two-day meeting of the EAC
Judicial Education Committee in Tanzania's northern city Arusha
Thursday, he pointed out that legal and judicial cooperation
among the EAC members, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, was vital in
the systematic pursuit of the development programs in the region.
</P>
<P>
Arrangements were also made to revive East African Law Reports
as well as the cross-border legal practice, he said.
</P>
<P>
Muthaura said judicial cooperation should be seen in the
broad context of supporting regional integration and development,
good governance, rule of law and social justice.
</P>
<P>
Regional cooperation required the development of pertinent
legislation and harmonization of some of the existing municipal
laws, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The executive secretary challenged the participants to propose
ways and means of cooperation among EAC countries in judicial
training programs and the related exchange of training materials
and resource persons.
</P>
<P>
"There was need to prepare syllabi and programs for education for
new judges and members of the lower bench and for continuing legal
education," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Judicial Education Committee is met for the second time
under the auspices of the EAC. The first was held here last
September.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Demonstrators Ask Netanyahu to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Israelis held
demonstration in front of the official residence of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu here today to show their indignation over his
remarks against the Left wing politicians.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, most of whom came from Tel Aviv by a convoy of
buses in the morning, asked Netanyahu to resign.
</P>
<P>
During his birthday party here Tuesday, Netanyahu told
Kabbalist Rabbi Yitzhak Kadouri that the Left wing has "forgotten
its Judaism."
</P>
<P>
The remark made in private was caught by Israel Radio
reporter's microphone, and broadcasted as a lead item on local TV
and radio stations Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
"The Left has forgotten what it is to be Jews," Netanyahu was
heard saying. "They think they'll place the defense of the land in
the hands of the Arabs, that the Arabs will look after us. Have
you heard such a thing."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's remarks caused a public uproar again in
Israel. Labor Party leader Ehud Barak said Tuesday that "it is
embarrassing to see the Prime Minister whispering sedition into
the ear of such an important Rabbi."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli opposition parties are considering a non-confidence
motion in parliament against the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who has been urged by some influential Rabbis to
apologize for his statement, asked the Left Wednesday to stop
seeking confrontation and quarrels.
</P>
<P>
He said that his statement has been taken out of context. He
also attacked the opposition leaders for distorting his words and
inciting against him and the government.

<HEADLINE> Russian Minister Carries Fresh Ideas on Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, who begins a Mideast tour today, carries with him new
ideas on reactivating the Mideast peace process, Russia's
Ambassador to Egypt Vladimir Gudev said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who arrived in Beirut earlier today and will visit
Syria, Jordan, Israel, Palestinian self-rule areas and Egypt, will
make his new ideas public during the tour, Gudev told the Middle
East News Agency in an interview today.
</P>
<P>
But the ambassador did not elaborate on the ideas, but saying
Primakov's visit will focus on reviving the Syrian and Lebanese
peace tracks in the process.
</P>
<P>
His visit comes at a "very delicate" time, which prompted
Russia to undertake fresh efforts to guarantee the resumption of
negotiations among the various parties of the Middle East
conflict, he added.
</P>
<P>
Given Primakov's expertise in the Middle East affairs, he
carries new ideas and evaluations based on Russia's experience in
the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the United States are the two co-sponsors of the
peace process that started in 1991, but Moscow's role has largely
eroded due to its domestic problems.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's visit came a month after U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright failed to realize any breakthrough in the
deadlocked peace talks between the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. Mideast role, Gudev said that Washington and Moscow
were partners in the peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
But he added that Moscow is seeking a more effective and
positive role in the Middle East and that its efforts do not weigh
any less than Washington's.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a matter of competition, but we want our efforts to
complement each other towards an effective joint action," he added.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the visit also stems from the talks
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Russian President Boris
Yeltsin held in Moscow in September that scrutinized the current
Mideast situation.
</P>
<P>
Gudev denied that Russia's interest in the Middle East is
shrinking, saying that his country's foreign policy recently gave
priority to China, Japan and India, but not at the price of the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Primakov is scheduled to arrive here on October 28 at the end
of his six-leg Mideast tour.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM to focus on New Ideas in Mideast Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov today described his ongoing Middle East tour as
a trip trying to focus on some new ideas to revive the deadlocked
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference after meeting with his
Lebanese counterpart Fares Boueiz, Primakov gave no details about
what he called the new ideas, saying only that the situation in
the region was very difficult.
</P>
<P>
He denied that Russia will join in the five-nation Lebanese
cease-fire committee consisting of representatives from
Lebanon, Syria, Israel, the United States and France, especially
in such a difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
Primacov arrived here this morning in the first leg of his
week-long Mideast tour which will also take him to Syria, Israel,
Palestinian self-rule areas, Jordan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Boueiz said that Lebanon welcomes Russia to play
any role in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the issue of appointment of a Russian peace
envoy similar to U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross and European
Union's special envoy Miguel Moratinos will be decided by Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Possevalyuk is the most
likely candidate for the Russian peace envoy in view of his
extensive visits and experience in the Middle East affairs,
according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Russia, as co-sponsor of the Mideast peace process with the
United States, is considering to come back to the region and
reassert Moscow's presence and role in the Mideast peace-making, a
process that has been largely dominated by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who will stay in Lebanon for 24 hours, is expected
to meet Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri and House Speaker Nabih Berri.

<P>
HARARE, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Chiefs of Defense Staff of
member states of the OAU Central Organ met here today to discuss
the organ's peace support operations, about training, planning,
command and control procedures, logistics and funding guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting will also resolve the question of how to
enhance the cooperation among the Organization of African Unity
(OAU), the U.N. and sub-regional groupings in the field of peace
missions.
</P>
<P>
The session has been preceded by a four-day meeting of
military experts groups. The experts made recommendations for the
establishment of a contingency force that would react to
peace-keeping needs.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the meeting, OAU Chairman and Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe said in a speech read on his behalf by
Defense Minister Moven Mahachi that the United Nations had
sometimes totally ignored the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said these developments had sent a clear message to
Africa that the OAU has to play a central role in resolving
African obligations of the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Any peace-keeping undertaking at continental or regional
level, he said, should get its mandate and financial assistance
from the U.N.
</P>
<P>
He said proposals by the U.S., Britain and France for an
African force should be scrutinized by Africa to find out whether
the continent needed that force or not.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address, OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed
Salim, making renewed calls for Africa to take responsibility of
its troubles, said sub-regional organizations had to cooperate to
enhance preparedness and overcome resource constraints.
</P>
<P>
''All these experiences lead me to believe that OAU member
states can no longer afford to stand aloof and expect the
international community to care more for our problems than we do,
or indeed to find solutions to those problems which, in many
instances, have been of our own making,'' said Salim.
</P>
<P>
Salim said, ''we should be ready for cooperation whenever and
wherever appropriate, but we should make it abundantly clear that
any such cooperation must be situated within the context of
Africa's own priorities.''
</P>
<P>
He added, ''I wish to commend the experts who have been
meeting in Harare over the last four days. I am quite cognizant
of the fact that the extent to which their recommendations could
and will be implemented in the future, depends on a number of
factors.''
</P>
<P>
The recommendations will be considered at the ministerial
meeting of the central organ which is scheduled to take place in
Addis Ababa in November 1997. The matter should again come under
consideration by the OAU council of ministers' meeting scheduled
for the same venue in February 1998.

<HEADLINE> 2,000 Cases of Drug-Resistant TB in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- About 2,000 South
Africans last year developed multi-drug resistant tuberculosis
(MDR TB), an almost incurable strain of the disease, the Health
Department has said.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimated that at least another 2,000 chronic cases of
the disease had not yet been reported, the department said in a
statement, quoted by the South African Press Association today.
</P>
<P>
"It is evident that MDR TB is increasing at a very alarming
rate," Communicable Disease Control Director Neil Cameron said.
</P>
<P>
Resistant strains of TB develop when patients do not complete
their TB treatment.
</P>
<P>
Treatment of MDR is very difficult and expensive and the
outcome is poor. Only about one third of MDR cases reported in
South Africa are cured.
</P>
<P>
It costs the Health Department about 20,000 Rand (4,300 U.S.
Dollars) to treat one MDR patient, compared to 200 Rand (43
dollars) for regular TB treatment over six months.
</P>
<P>
"A recent survey conducted by the Medical Research Council in
Western Cape, Gauteng and Mpumalanga (provinces) showed that
there is a one percent MDR incidence in new TB cases," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
International health experts Wednesday warned against the
worldwide spread of MDR TB.
</P>
<P>
"The world again faces the specter of incurable TB," one
expert said.
</P>
<P>
They told a news conference in Washington, the United States,
that they have pinpointed MDR TB "hot zones" across the globe.
</P>
<P>
The "hot zones" include India, Russia, Latvia, Estonia, the
Dominican Republic, Argentina and Cote d'Ivoire, a study release
by the experts said.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by an international network of 22 top
laboratories and with a survey of 50,000 TB cases in 35
countries.
</P>
<P>
In each of the hot zones, the disease was often resistant to
the commonly prescribed drugs -- isoniazid and rifampicin.
</P>
<P>
This made TB an incurable disease for anyone who does not have
access to the most sophisticated and expensive health care.
</P>
<P>
In industrialized countries, MDR TB could raise treatment
costs a hundredfold, up to 210,000 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The study found that most MDR TB could be prevented by
addressing bad treatment of the disease.
</P>
<P>
South African Health Department is aiming to prevent the
spread of MDR through its "Directly Observed Treatment
Short-course (DOTS)," under which TB patients are watched by
health workers as they swallow their medication every day.
</P>
<P>
Patients are monitored until there is recorded proof that they
are cured. "The dots strategy stops MDR TB at its source," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
MDR TB clinics have been set up in most provinces of South
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Israel Strives for Netanyahu-Clinton Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel has been making
intense efforts to arrange a summit between Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and U. S. President Bill Clinton during
Netanyahu's visit to Washington next month, a senior Israeli
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Cabinet Secretary Denny Naveh told Israel Radio that
Clinton should not avoid meeting with Netanyahu, since efforts
are being made by the Netanyahu-led government, which he said
Washington is fully aware, to advance the peace process between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is expected to travel to the U.S. to address the
General Assembly of the Jewish Federations of the U.S. and Canada
in Indianapolis on November 16. But his political adviser David
Bar-Illan indicated that to meet with Clinton is Netanyahu's real
priority.
</P>
<P>
The White House, however, has said that Clinton has prior
arrangements during Netanyahu's visit and it might be impossible
to fit Netanyahu into the president's schedule.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reportedly would not want to travel to the U.S. if
he is unable to see Clinton there, as this may be construed by
his opponents as evidence that he is out of favor in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials discussed early this week the possible need
to put off Netanyahu's departure for the U.S. until the summit is
fixed.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the possibility that Netanyahu does not
attend the conference of the Jewish federations, but makes a
televised speech to it, and the summit may be delayed until late
November.
</P>
<P>
Since Netanyahu came to power in June last year, his hardline
policies have taken the Middle East peace process into constant
crises, which the U.S. administration has expressed
disappointment and dissatisfaction.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Calls for World Coop in National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- President Frederick Chiluba
today urged the international community to participate in the
construction of Zambia's economy so as to develop it into a
"prosperous" nation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the State House to mark Zambia's 33rd anniversary
of independence, Chiluba said the Zambians want to create
opportunities and have a chance to develop their country so that
it stands as an "independent, sovereign and equal partner" of the
global community.
</P>
<P>
He said the transmission of Zambia into a prosperous nation
cannot be realized without cooperation of other countries and
international institutions and the full support of the Zambian
people.
</P>
<P>
However, the president emphasized that Zambia prefers
investment, local and foreign, to charity while calling on
investors to pour money into Zambia's agro-business.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, who won its independence from Britain on October 24 in
1964, has great potentials to be tapped in agriculture with vast
cultivatable land and water resources.
</P>
<P>
But the agriculture in the country is only a subsistence
industry and far from development due to the lack of necessary
technology and the low level of productivity.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Chiluba also mapped out a bright future for
his country, saying, "we want to create Zambia into a nation of
free men and women, a land of freedom, a land of liberty, a land
of human rights and a land with expanding economic
opportunities."
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 people including senior government officials and
diplomatic missions attended the National Day celebrations which
were boycotted by two main opposition parties -- the United
National Independence party led by former President Kenneth
Kaunda and the Zambia Democratic Congress.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Oil Tanker Bolts for Mediterranean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- In what has been described as
the first incident of piracy in the history of the Suez Canal, a
Turkish oil tanker today escaped from the waterway into the
Mediterranean with nine Egyptians on board.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish vessel had been held at the Suez port for five
days on court orders pending honoring 375,000 dollars in
financial dues to the ship owners' representative at the port,
according to the Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The tanker, coming in from Singapore carrying 44,000 tons of
crude oil, was detained on its way to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The tanker's captain had requested permission to cross along
to Port Said where he promised to wait till the problem was
settled with the company owning the ship in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But as the tanker arrived in Port Said, the captain turned a
deaf ear to instructions by the Egyptian guide on board and the
security police, speeding up his ship at full gear out to sea.
</P>
<P>
The navy promptly dispatched two naval boats, but failed to
bring back the errant vessel, which managed to sail across
territorial waters into Mediterranean international waters.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Ministry has been notified of the incident to
make contacts with the Turkish government and seek to return the
nine Egyptians abducted.
</P>
<P>
The 195-kilometer Suez Canal, which stretches from Port Tawfiq
to Port Said from south to north, is the longest canal in the
world without locks and also the only canal directly linking the
Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
It was opened for international navigation on November 17,
1879 and Egypt nationalized it on July 26, 1956. Among Egypt's
four largest foreign currency earners, it garnered 1.88 billion
U.S. dollars in 1996, down from 2.1 billion dollars in 1995 due
to a continued decline of ships using the waterway.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Approves 55 Job-creating Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Export Processing
Zone Authority (EPZA) has approved 55 job-creating projects worth
some 90 million U.S. Dollars in a bid to develop export-oriented
and technology-driven economy, EPZA said today.
</P>
<P>
EPZA was established in August last year to promote
value-added exports with a view to improving the country's
balance of payments position.
</P>
<P>
To qualify for EPZ status, a company should export at least 80
percent of its annual sales as well as satisfying a number of
other criteria such as employment creation.
</P>
<P>
EPZA said the projects, covering a wide cross-section of the
agro-based economy and with an employment creation capacity of
more than 11,000 workers over the next three years, capped a
difficult year in which the authority has had to grapple with red
tape.
</P>
<P>
Timber processing had the largest number of approvals, with
projects worth more than 25 million US Dollars going through
while food processing and manufacturing closely followed with
investments of 20 million Dollars and 21 million Dollars
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Other approved projects are in chemicals, floriculture,
footwear, furniture, manufacturing and services.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Issue on US Top Agenda: Coordinator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States has made it
clear that to work out a just and lasting solution to the
protracted Cyprus problem is one of the top objectives of its
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Thomas Miller, U.S. State Department Special
Coordinator for Cyprus, at a meeting of U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Committee Thursday, Cyprus News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
He told the committee that the U.S. fully supports the peace
process sponsored by the United Nations to find a solution "within
the parameters of a bizonal, bicommunal federation" in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Miller pointed out that the search for a settlement "is a
process in which slow and steady progress may be the key to a
breakthrough."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said that he could see new opportunities
moving closer toward ending the intercommunal strife in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"One important factor in the Cyprus equation is the
application by Cyprus to join the European Union," he said.
</P>
<P>
He described this as a "positive development" providing
important, positive incentives for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
Miller said that the U.S. also supports a closer relationship
between the EU and Turkey, which, too, he believed can have a
positive impact on the overall atmosphere for the settlement
process.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that the path to a settlement is fraught with
difficulty, Miller expressed the U.S. administration's
determination to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. will work closely with all parties, including
the U.N., the EU, involved in the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Miller visited Cyprus last month, bringing Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
together to discuss security issues. But the meeting ended with no
results.
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean island was divided into a Greek Cypriot south
and a Turkish Cypriot north in 1974 when Turkey landed its troops
and took over the northern third following a failed coup by Greek
Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus", recognized only by Ankara.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Happy with Conakry Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra
Leone known as the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC)
today said it is happy with the agreement on the resolution of
the current crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the junta and west African foreign
ministers signed an accord Thursday in Conakry, capital of
Guinea, under which the junta is to step down in six months
times.
</P>
<P>
It also requires the return of ex-rebel leader Foday Sankoh
from detention in Nigeria to play an active role in the peace
process, and the establishment of a broad-based government by
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah ousted by the junta on May 25 this
year.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement," said junta spokesman Aliu Kamara in the
capital Freetown today, "actually represents the thought, the
feelings and everything that AFRC stands for."
</P>
<P>
"So we are really very happy and the entire society jubilant,"
Kamara said, quoted by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the peace talk was celebrated by prolonged
shootings from light arms and an outburst of civilian
demonstrations from various parts of Freetown Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
When the news reached the capital, crowds chanting "war is
over, we now have peace", came from spontaneous demonstrations
with people holding makeshift placards, some of which read,
"Sierra Leone has been saved from doom," "No more Alfa jets" and
"Kabbah has made Sierra Leone peaceful again."
</P>
<P>
From state house, guards were seen leaving their security
posts and shaking hands with passers-by while the former rebel
Revolutionary United Front combatants stopped their trucks to hug
anyone in sight.
</P>
<P>
Both the AFRC soldiers and west African peace-keepers, who
were fighting hours ago, stopped hostilities and were no longer
enemies.
</P>
<P>
All this shows the happiness of the society, according to the
spokesman, who said the junta would definitely follow the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
He also allayed the fears that the army would possibly take
advantage of the six-month transition period to do much looting
and stealing of diamonds, saying that it was only the imagination
of some people.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman promised that the junta would return power to
Kabbah six months later in accordance with the agreement, but
claimed that nobody in Sierra Leone wanted him.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the junta's disgust at the west African
peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG, which during its operations
to enforce sanctions against the junta had repeated clashes with
AFRC soldiers.
</P>
<P>
According to the document signed in Conakry, ECOMOG and United
Nations observers will work together to monitor the
implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The UN can come in but the ECOMOG forces can leave. We don't
want the ECOMOG forces. They are destroying our country," said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"They have destroyed our entire system by making people leave
our communities, how can they come in to do the monitoring job
effectively?" he asked, adding that a neutral force is needed for
this mission.
</P>
<P>
At press time, there is no news about how ECOMOG is to carry
out the monitoring job in Sierra Leone, especially when the junta
refused to say whether or not it would cooperate with the
sub-regional force.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Signs Oil Deal with US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. company Nuevo Energy Inc.
signed on Thursday a 10-million-U.S. Dollars oil exploration
project in Ghana which gives it off-shore petroleum rights
covering more than 2.7 million acres.
</P>
<P>
The exploration will be carried out in the central basin area,
south of the capital Accra, the News Agency of Nigeria reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is Nuevo's second in Ghana, under which the U.S.
company will solely sponsor the project with the state-owned
Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) having an initial
carried interest of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
In case of discovery, GNPC can increase its participation to
25 percent, according to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Nuevo President Doug Foshee said that the prospects found
during the reprocessing of data on the cape three points project
in the western region encouraged them to sign the new agreement.
</P>
<P>
"This new acreage contains the same type and size of
structures which produce prolifically elsewhere in west Africa,
providing us with world-class exploration opportunities including
deep water potential," the president was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last March, Nuevo signed a similar agreement for access to 1.7
million acres which involved reprocessing, shooting additional
seismic and drilling an exploration well.
</P>
<P>
Foshee said since the agreement, Nuevo has reprocessed about
4,000 km of seismic data and will be shooting an additional 1,800
km in November. The first well is scheduled to be drilled as from
June next year.

<HEADLINE> Faction Conflict Kills 11 in Somali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Ismail Jumale Human Rights
Center in Somali said it has recorded 11 deaths and eight wounded
for clan-based retaliation activities in both north and south of
the capital Mogadishu since yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The local human rights organization condemned a serious of
renewed killings among the opposing sides in Mogadishu in the
past two days, said a statement issued by the organization here
today.
</P>
<P>
The deceased include the Huriwa District police station
commander, Lieutenant Abdi Hashi Elmi.
</P>
<P>
The human rights center said that a number of innocent people
are also missing after they have been kidnaped by militiamen for
similar reasons and their fate remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
The center has blamed the political leaders for failing to
contain this renewed hostility among the people of Mogadishu at a
time when the security situation and intermingling among the
societies was improving with the help of the local social groups
and traditional elders.
</P>
<P>
This renewed hostility which also affected the public
transport in the Somali capital crossing the green lines is
taking place at a time when a large conference attended by more
than 500 clan elites, Moslem scholars, politicians and other
intellectuals is taking place for the second day today in South
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to the technical committee of the conference, this
three-day meeting sponsored by the Ayr sub-clan of Habar Gidir is
aimed at solving the political differences among the Habr Gidir
Communities, the other Hawiye clans and all Somalis in general as
well.
</P>
<P>
The conference was not participated by the supporters of Osman
Hassan Ali Atto whose absence was justified as that they could
not attend for technical reasons.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the organizers of the conference have
forwarded the agendas and proposals which included the
pacification of the capital, a peaceful solution be found for the
crises in the regions of Bay and Bakol and the improvement of
relations with the neighboring countries, especially Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
A 15-member committee was also established for studying the
implementation modalities of the agreed points.
</P>
<P>
According to chief Ahmed Rage, Mogadishu's first Mayor and the
leader of the conference hosting sub-clan, the final goal of the
meeting is the reconnaissance of a common view by the Habar Gidir
clans men in regard to a national reconciliation conference, the
pacification of the Somali clans from the grass roots level and
the formation of a common administration for the capital
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from the other sub-clans of Habar Gidir including
Mohamed Hashi Dhuhulow who spoke at the opening ceremony said the
imposition of the Sharia laws in Somalia would minimize the rate
of crimes, leading to a harmony life among the Habar Gidir and
other Somalis so as to rescue the nation from this chaotic
situation.
</P>
<P>
Both the conference and killings are taking place at a time
when leaders of all three main factions of Mogadishu are not at
home. Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Hussein Mohamed Aidid are believed to
be in Cairo at present for a special meeting sponsored by the
Egyptian government.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- South African Breweries
(SAB) will invest 40 million U. S. Dollars in a new brewery in
Ethiopia, the company announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The company, which is the biggest brewery in Africa, will

<P>
NICOSIA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides today pledged his support to the United Nations and
thanked the world organization for its untiring efforts to find
a just and lasting settlement in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
In a message to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the
occasion of the 52nd anniversary of the U.N., Clerides assured
Annan of his "constant support and earnest dedication to the
efforts for the fulfillment of the U.N. principles, ideals and
objectives."
</P>
<P>
"We wish to reassure you of our full support to your efforts
and those of the international community and of our commitment
to continue working with you, in a constructive spirit with a
view to achieving a just solution to our problem, based on the
relevant resolutions of the U.N. and the principles enshrined in
the Charter," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
Such a solution will also reinforce the peace-making role of
the United Nations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island following
a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been trying for
decades to reunite the divided island as a bizonal, bicommunal
federation through peace talks, but so far no tangible results
have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Clerides expressed the hope that as the U.N. enters in a new
year, "we will witness further substantial progress toward the
prevalence of justice, peace and stability on the basis of the
universal principles, freedoms and ideals to which we are all
committed."

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and visiting Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas signed a
state border treaty and an agreement on division of the exclusive
economic zone and the continental shelf of the Baltic Sea today in
the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, after signing the
Russian-Lithuanian documents, Yeltsin said that "now there are two
independent law-governed states, neighbors" which have signed the
two documents.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president said there are almost no problems in
Russian-Lithuanian relations when a broad range of questions were
discussed.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also handed over to Brazauskas a statement on security
guarantees for the Baltic republics and confidence-building
between them and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"To develop this initiative we propose that such guarantees be
given in the form of a unilateral obligation of the Russian
Federation consolidated, possibly, in the framework of
international law by means of concluding an agreement on
goodneighborliness and mutual insurance of security between Russia
and separate Baltic countries or between Russia and the three
Baltic countries," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Russia agrees that guarantees of the security of Baltic
countries should become multilateral through their joining, for
instance, by the United States, Germany, France and some other
Western countries, the document said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow does not rule out the idea of creating a regional
expanse of stability and security with the inclusion of North
European countries.
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian president, for his part, expressed thanks for
Russian support for the Lithuanian independence and security
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas arrived in Moscow Thursday for an official visit. He
also met today with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and
Speaker of the State Duma Gennady Seleznyov.

<HEADLINE> UK Chancellor to Make Statement on EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Gordon Brown, the Chancellor, is
to make a commons statement on Britain's attitude to the Single
Currency Monday, the Treasury announced here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury said the Chancellor was "acting decisively to stop
speculation by making a statement at the earliest possible
opportunity."
</P>
<P>
The statement is expected to include a suggestion that entry
should be based on whether certain economic tests are met.
</P>
<P>
These might include meeting the convergence criteria, but would
also make reference to the degree of convergence of the business
cycle in Britain with that in the rest of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Speculation has increased in recent weeks about Britain's
intentions on EMU. The impact on financial markets has been
profound.
</P>
<P>
For instance, an article in the Financial Times on September 26
said, "The government is on the point of adopting a much more
positive approach to EMU, with a statement shortly that sterling
is likely to join at an early opportunity after the 1999 launch."
</P>
<P>
The market reaction was immediate and strong. Sterling dropped
four pfennigs to 2.83 German marks. The equity market jumped 161
points and the spread between the UK and German 10-year bonds fell
below 1 percent for the first time since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Tory have accused the Labor government of creating
confusion on EMU by giving conflicting briefings to newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Members of parliament will return to the Commons next Monday
after a three-month recess.

LONDON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all made healthy recovery from Thursday's heavy losses early
today, but the rally was fragile and most of them ended a volatile
week in the negative ground.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index on the London market had initially powered
above the key 5,000-point level as Hong Kong recovered but it
later fell back well below that mark and ended down 21.3 points at
4,970.2, falling 300.9 points from last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the early rally of the market ran out of
steam later today as many investors were still nervous and drew
only little comfort from Hong Kong's stronger performance and
remained wary about its volatility.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the DAX-30 index of floor trading, which ends
before Wall Street opens, closed up 73.61 points at 4,050.87 as
the market showed strong gains as it tracked Hong Kong's 5
percent recovery, still a fall of 10.63 points from last week.
</P>
<P>
But in later trading the computerized IBIS index fell with
investors unwilling to hold long positions going into the weekend
and the index ended at 3,981.44, only 5.06 points up.
</P>
<P>
The Paris CAC-40 index fell by 7.84 points by the close to
stand at 2,8849.03, 108.99 points lower on the week. Share prices
retreated as European markets tracked a reversal by New York
stocks.

<HEADLINE> NATO to Help Secure Bosnian Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization today confirmed that the NATO-led Stabilization Force
(SFOR) will provide the general security framework for the coming
Bosnian parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after the North Atlantic Council, the
executive body of the 16-nation alliance, consulted with the 20
non-NATO SFOR contributing countries on the issue.
</P>
<P>
A modest and temporary reinforcement of the stabilization force
was authorized in support of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe that is organizing and supervising the
Bosnian elections.
</P>
<P>
The security framework, similar to the one provided by the SFOR
during the September 13-14 Bosnian municipal elections, will be
conducted on a smaller scale via appropriate logistical and
communication support in that there will be fewer polling
stations.
</P>
<P>
In early September, the SFOR was reinforced with six more
battalions to a total of 40,000 troops and 12 more F-16 fighter
jets. Some of the troops were equipped with policing tools such as
batons, shields, tear gases and non-lethal grenades.
</P>
<P>
But a NATO spokesman said that this time the reinforcement
would be much smaller.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Pledges Continued EU Support for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 24 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told
visiting Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat that Germany and the
European Union would continue their efforts to back Middle East
peace.
</P>
<P>
A statement by German government spokesman Herbert Schmuelling
said Kohl made the pledge during his talks with Arafat, and added
that Middle East peace could only be achieved "in a spirit of
mutual trust."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "both (leaders) expressed rising alarm over the
present situation regarding implementation of the Oslo peace
accord," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
But the statement mentioned no fresh German or EU initiatives
or any further German economic aid Palestinians hoped for.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources have said that Arafat's two-day visit was
aimed at gaining more aid and a tougher German stance regarding
the current Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had talks with Kohl after a breakfast meeting with
German parliamentary leader Rita Suessmuth.
</P>
<P>
Implying criticism of Israel's blocking aid for the
Palestinians, Suessmuth in a statement noted that it was vital for
international aid to reach the recipients in an "unbureaucratic
manner without hindrance."
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Bonn after a brief stopover in Paris Thursday
where he urged EU help to push forward his negotiations with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The key point was to talk Israel into implementing treaties
already signed, he told the press after talking with French
President Jacques Chirac. He noted that the recent U.S. mediated
contacts with Israel turned out to be "disappointing."
</P>
<P>
"We are counting on France and Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Bonn, Arafat will also meet with Economics
Minister Guenter Rexrodt, Finance Minister Theo Waigel and Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel.

the truth of the air crash of Tupolev plane in Mbuzini, South
Africa 11 years ago which killed former Mozambican president
Samora Machel.

Mocumbi said that the South African government of President
Nelson Mandela has discussed the matter with Mozambique, noting
that Mandela's government is taking an attitude different from
that of the apartheid regime which had never worked together with
Mozambique to solve this problem.
</P>
<P>
Re-investigation into the air crash will be supervised by the

ATHENS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis today called for cool-headedness and prudence in face of
tension between Greece and Turkey, the semi-official Athens News
Agency (ANA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Greece had no reason to lose its direction and participate in
the tension and entanglement which Turkey was seeking, said
Simitis while addressing a cabinet meeting today.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey was trying to use the tension as "a
pressure lever" in order to pursue its targets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos today
accused Turkey of fabricating "a non-existent incident" in an
effort to cover up its sole responsibility for the tension in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos today said that any
country which intentionally created a serious incident in the
Aegean would be opening "the door to the lunatic asylum."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that Greece's position remained the same and
could not be different.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Greek-Turkish relations have witnessed an
increased tension following the breakdown of the New York meeting
between the two countries' foreign ministers, military exercises
by Greece and Cyprus, the harassment of a plane carrying
Tsohatzopoulos to and from Cyprus by Turkish warplanes last week
and the collision of Greek and Turkish navy vessels in the Aegean.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Further international
cooperation and coordination should be strengthed in combating
organized transnational crime, Chinese delegate Diao Mingshen
stressed here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 52nd session of the General Assembly, Diao said
organized transnational crime had seriously jeopardized the peace
and tranquility of the people of various countries and constituted
a grave threat to political stability and social and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Diao said the Political Declaration and Global Action Plan
formulated at the Naples Ministerial Conference had given much
impetus to the international community's joint efforts at
controlling and preventing organized transnational crimes.
</P>
<P>
The delegate said the Chinese government wished to further
strengthen its cooperation with other countries and international
organizations to combat transnational crime, and the Chinese
government proposed the following measures:
</P>
<P>
-- To elaborate as soon as possible a Convention Against
Organized Transnational Crimes. The convention should give full
consideration to the economic, political and culture backgrounds
of different countries to maximize the number of countries likely
to accept and accede to the proposed convention;
</P>
<P>
-- To give further play to the role of the UN in combating
organized transnational crime by providing up-to-date information
and professional advice to member states to enhance their efforts
at controlling and combating organized transnational crime;
</P>
<P>
-- To increase technical assistance in the field to developing
countries. The United Nations should allocate more resources for
technical assistance in this field to those countries that needed
it most;
</P>
<P>
-- To further strengthen the exchanges and cooperation between
countries in the area of extradition and other matters relating to
criminal justice. This should be done in accordance with the
principles of equality and mutual benefit and relevant norms of
international law.

<HEADLINE> Non-Surgery Skin Cancer Treatment Offers Success: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A skin cancer treatment called
electrochemotherapy can offer a 98 percent success, according to
scientists at the University of South Florida of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The method, combining chemotherapy with electric pulses, is
applicable to patients with common form of skin cancer, said the
Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology carrying the study
in its latest issue published today.
</P>
<P>
After receiving injection of bleomycin, an anti-cancer
chemotherapy drug, the patient will have his or her cancerous
tissues hit by pulses of electricity through needle electrodes.
</P>
<P>
Electricity then opens skin pores for the drug to target cancer
cells more effectively leading to their destruction.
</P>
<P>
The study shows that it is an advantageous treatment for
patients who are unable to receive surgery for health reasons, who
have inoperable tumors or who hate disfigurement as a result of
surgery, because it leaves fewer scars, the journal said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the tumors in the study required only one treatment and
none of the patients has a recurrence of their cancer in 18 months
after treatment, it added.

floods and to inspect the damage caused by the rains," Moi said
as he visited a home for disabled people in Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to various organizations and donors to
supplement the government's contribution towards the
rehabilitation of areas ravaged by floods.
</P>
<P>
A committee, to be headed by Minister in the Office of the
President John Koech, will be set up to assist flood victims and
rebuild the damaged infrastructure, said Moi.
</P>
<P>
The government is also considering writing off loans amounting
to six million Shillings (100,000 Dollars) owed to Agricultural

<P>
Fierce rains, which the meteorological department said to be
the highest recorded there in recent years, have since Sunday
killed 25 people, displaced hundreds, turned crop lands into
swamps and flooded many homes, shops, bridges and road services.
</P>
<P>
Power supply was intermittent in many parts of the coast.
</P>
<P>
Coast Province Commissioner Tim Sirma said southern Kwale
district was the worst affected, with over 140 houses destroyed
and 16 bridges washed away.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan meteorological officials warned Tuesday that more and
heavier rains are expected in two weeks due to the effects of
high sea surface temperatures (simply known as El Nino) which
cause changes in the rain pattern worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The rains would climax next month and would decline by early
next year. However, the eastern African country will also see a
shortage of rain next year also due to the El Nino, the officials
predict.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM to Attend Southeastern European </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz will attend the Southeastern European Summit to be held in
the Greek island of Crete on November 2-4, the Anatolia News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, Yilmaz will hold bilateral contacts with
leaders of the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to meet with his Greek counterpart
Constantinos Simitis to discuss the current tensions between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Greece and Turkey have been worsening
since the Cypriot government announced that it would not give up
the controversial plan to buy S-300 missiles from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Athens and Ankara accused each other of increasing tensions
on the divided Mediterranean island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Turkish Foreign Ministry protested against the
alleged harassment of a Turkish submarine by a Greek minesweeper
in the Aegean. But Greece denied the charges later.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Athens Wednesday, Greek
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that Greece does not
pin high hopes on the success of the Simitis-Yilmaz meeting
during the Crete summit.
</P>
<P>
Observers here, however, believe that the Turkish-Greek
contacts in Crete will help relax tensions between them.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have been at odds over a number of issues,
including the mineral resources under the Aegean, airspace
division as well as the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Both of them station troops in Cyprus, which has been divided
into the Greek Cypriot community in the south and Turkish
Cypriot community in the north since 1974.

NEW YORK, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia has appealed to the
United States for permanent Most Favored Nation status and free

ADDIS ABABA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Central Organ of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Mechanism for Conflict
Prevention#,Management and Resolution today urged the Anjouanese

risks, for peace, security and stability in the Comoros as well
as for the long-term interest of the Anjouanese and the Comorian
people in general if their decision to hold the referendum was
implemented".

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG to Consider Ways for Peace in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force (ECOMOG) whose bombing raids while enforcing embargo on the
military junta in Sierra Leone has helped draw the junta to the
negotiation table is to consider new deployment for final peace
in the country.
</P>
<P>
"In the next 48 hours, we are supposed to be meeting to iron
out modalities on how we are going to deploy to effectively
enforce the embargo in a very peaceful manner and without any
confrontation," said ECOMOG Force Commander Major-General Victor
Malu today.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG has been mandated to enforce the United Nations and
west African sanctions and embargo on the junta. The force has
clashed with the junta's troops during the mission.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement reached on Thursday between the
junta and west African foreign ministers, ECOMOG will, along with
UN observers, monitor the quit of the junta in six months' time.
</P>
<P>
To carry out the mission, ECOMOG will also be deployed to
start disarmament of combatants in Sierra Leone on December 1
this year as stipulated in the peace plan, Malu said at the
ECOMOG headquarters in Monrovia, capital of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The combatants, according to observers here, might refer to
the fighters of the former rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
which fought successive governments of the country since 1991.
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 of its fighters left the bushes for the capital
Freetown at the invitation of the junta shortly after it
overthrew the legitimate government in the May 25 coup. They have
since become allies with the junta's forces, fighting side by
side against ECOMOG troops.
</P>
<P>
To restore peace to Sierra Leone, the agreement demands
combatants be disarmed, demobilized and reintegrated. And it is
part of ECOMOG's responsibility to be involved in this job,
according to Malu.
</P>
<P>
However, the junta is unwilling to cooperate with ECOMOG in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Aliu Kamara, the spokesman of the junta, said earlier today,
they welcome UN observers to come to monitor the implementation
of the agreement but not ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
"The UN can come in but the ECOMOG forces can leave. We don't
want the ECOMOG forces. They are destroying our country," said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
But Malu rejected it, saying that "we are not prepared to go
into Sierra Leone to contend military operation and destroy that
country."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed he would travel to Sierra Leone to discuss
modalities for the disarmament and related matters and try to
build confidence among the members of the junta.
</P>
<P>
Malu also expressed belief that if the junta cooperates with
the international community well, the sanction on it is expected
to be lifted soon.
</P>
<P>
As for the release of RUF leader Foday Sankoh from detention
in Nigeria as required under the agreement, Malu said he would
return to Sierra Leone at the same time with ousted President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.

<HEADLINE> Russia-Chechnya Commission Hold Fifth Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The fifth meeting of the joint
commission on a Moscow-Grozny treaty was held in Moscow today,
according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Among the subjects for discussion are problems concerning
political settlement and violations of human rights in Chechnya,
primarily kidnappings, which have become more frequent in the
republic, as well as economic cooperation between ministries and
agencies of the two countries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It was a detailed but difficult discussion on fulfillment of
previous agreements at the meeting, Russian Security Council
Secretary Ivan Rybkin was cited as saying.
</P>
<P>
The signed customs agreement is not fulfilled, including its
part concerning the status of the Grozny Severny airport.
</P>
<P>
He informed the Chechen side of Duma hearings on problems of
the Chechen Republic and said the hearings were constructive.
</P>
<P>
They thus involve parliament members in the negotiations, said
Rybkin. The Duma approved of economic interaction between Russian
and Chechen ministries. The 1998 federal budget provides for
allocation of 1.8 trillion roubles for needs of the Chechen
Republic, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Baku-Grozny-Novorossiisk oil pipeline, Chechen member of
the joint commission Khozh-Akhmed Yarikhanov said that the Chechen
section is fully prepared for operation.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Baku will start filling the pipeline
with oil Saturday, and the filling will take seven-eight days. The
pipeline already contains 15,000 tons of Chechen oil.
</P>
<P>
The commission will continue working Saturday morning and
discuss the search for persons in captivity in Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> GS President Says UN Capable of Internal Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations was
capable of internal change and would play a very important role in
the coming century, Hennadiy Udovenko, president of the General
Assembly of the United Nations, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion of the United Nations Day, October 24,
Udovenko said it was a well-recognized fact that with the end of
the cold war on the one hand, and the advent of globalization on
the other, the United Nations found itself dealing with an
entirely new array of crises, conflicts and problems.
</P>
<P>
The president said that its tasks multipied, just as its
resources dwindled, and it was asked to do more, but to do it with
less. As calls for change grew louder, some critics began to
question the organization's ability to be an effective mechanism
for the challenges of a new era.
</P>
<P>
The president said that at the United Nations, hardly anybody
had ever doubted that the organization was strong enough and
flexible enough to step into the next century.
</P>
<P>
He said the UN reform engine was running smoothly and getting
ready to switch into high gear. The General Assembly was in the
process of considering a package of the secretary-general's
measures and proposals on renewing the organization.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko said that in and of itself, the consideration,
conducted in a transparent and businesslike manner with the
involvement of all interested member states, underscored the
democratic nature of the United Nations as a whole and the General
Assembly in particular as its main deliberative and legislative
body.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that in the meantime, a number of
important steps had already been taken to rationalize and
streamline United Nations operations and to promote a new
institutional culture.
</P>
<P>
He noted all of this served to show the United Nations was not
only a mere survivor, but a flexible and dynamic organism.
Allowing nations to cope with global problems through collective
deliberation and joint actions, it was an indispensable instrument
to take with the world into the next millennium. There was no
doubt that the United Nations would play a very important role in
the coming century.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. congressional leaders
today decided to block the government from developing national
tests for reading and math by including the measure in a 1998
spending bill for the Education.
</P>
<P>
They called for the Education Department to cancel its contract
to develop the voluntary tests in fourth-grade reading and
eighth-grade mathematics.
</P>
<P>
The department wants to start the tests in the Spring of 1999.
The tests that the administration has proposed would be an
individualized version of the National Assessment of Educational
Progress, a federally sponsored test that measures trends in
achievement but does not give individual scores.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who tried to nationalize the measure of tests to
upgrade the standards of education, said today he would veto the
spending bill if it includes the ban.
</P>
<P>
"If there's any attempt in Congress to kill this effort at
national standards and voluntary testing, I will have to veto it,"
Clinton said in a speech at the White House to educators.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that congressional Republicans want the government
to "do next to nothing in education."
</P>
<P>
The Republicans hold the tests are unnecessary, the money could
be better spent and testing should be controlled by local school
officials.

<P>
ANKARA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish warplanes have
bombed the camps of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in
northern Iraq, according to a statement issued by the Foreign
Ministry today.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the warplanes hit the PKK targets in
the areas of Snath, Avagoze, Elcan and Haftanin in northern Iraq
on Thursday and today. But it did not give the casualties.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has frequently launched cross-border attacks into
northern Iraq since 1995 in an attempt to wipe out the PKK
militants taking shelters there, who are termed as threats to its
border security.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, about 15,000 Turkish troops entered the area
and killed more than 800 PKK rebels. Pulling back most of the
troops this month, Turkey still stationed unspecific number of
troops there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local newspaper Hurriyet reported that the air raids
were also directed against the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, a
major faction in northern Iraq, which allegedly maintains a
relaxed relation with the PKK.
</P>
<P>
However, the Turkish Foreign Ministry statement denied the
report, saying that the bombings are against the PKK rebels.

</P>
<P>
"We do regret the decision by France, Russia, China, Egypt
and Kenya to abstain on this resolution," State Department
spokesman Lee McClenny said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, sponsored by the United States and Britain, was
intended to impose new sanctions on Iraq by banning its officials
travelling abroad if Iraq fails to cooperate with U.N.
inspectors responsible to verify whether Iraq is in compliance
with orders to destroy mass destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
France and Russia did not support the resolution, arguing
that Iraq's recent behavior did not warrant punishment. They
also objected to the drafting of a list of Iraqis who would be
affected by the ban.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was passed on Thursday but at the cost of
considerable damage to the United States, who was desperately
trying to hold an image of international solidarity against
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, analysts said here.
</P>
<P>
McClenny said Saddam should understand the message of the
resolution: the Security Council supported the mandate of the arms
inspection commission.
</P>
<P>
"He should see clearly that if he continues to challenge that
mandate, the Council intends to take further action," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cook: Commonwealth to Consider Tough Measures on Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EDINBURGH, October 24 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said here today that the on-going Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meeting (CHOGM) would consider tough measures against
Nigeria including oil sanctions and even expulsion.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Commonwealth membership was suspended two years ago
at the Auckland Commonwealth summit because of the alleged
wide-spread human rights violations in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the Commonwealth reaction to the Nigerian issue,
Cook told reporters that the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group
(CMAG) would present a report to the CHOGM meeting Saturday,
putting forward tough measures and robust action.
</P>
<P>
"If these additional measures fail to produce the result by
next October, the Ministerail Group should again look at some other
additional measures," Cook said, adding "expulsion is one of the
options and another would be an oil ban."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the reports that Nigeria might pull out of the
bloc, Cook said: "That is a matter for the Nigerian government. If
the government of Nigeria comes itself to the conclusions that it
could not meet the principles, then it is for itself to decide
whether or not it wishes to remain in the Commonwealth."

<HEADLINE> GCC Rejects EP's Interference In Internal Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) today denounced a critical statement by the European
Parliament (EP) on the United Arag Emirates' judicatory, demanding
it not to interfere in GCC internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
GCC Justice Ministers said in a joint statement issued after
their one-day gathering in Doha today that the Gulf alliance
considered the EP statement as a "blatant interference" in GCC
states' judicial affairs and procedures.
</P>
<P>
They demanded the EP and other international organizations to
respect the basic foundation of the GCC judicature and keep
themselves away from poking their noses into GCC members'
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The GCC justice ministers denounce what the EP issued on
criticizing the UAE's judgment (system) ... and the ministers
considered that as a blatant interference in GCC's judicial
affairs," the ministers said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The foundation of laws and the legislative elements (in GCC
states) are from the Islamism which is the (Arab) nation's
religion. The laws protect the stability of the society and
the life safety of the people," they stated in the statement
obtained here.
</P>
<P>
"The GCC ministers demand the EP and other international
organizations who made similar criticism against Bahrain and
other Gulf states to respect the basic foundation of the GCC
judicature and keep themselves away from meddling in GCC's
internal affairs," they added.
</P>
<P>
The GCC's counterattack against the EP came nearly one
month after the EP criticized the UAE, Bahrain and some of
other GCC countries' judicial defects in dealing with criminals,
saying such defects caused the violation of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The EP said in its statement against the UAE issued in
the late of September that the Gulf country failed to give
two murderers rights to defense before executing them.
</P>
<P>
The UAE debated that the execution of the two man, identified
as an Iranian and a UAE national who committed a series of
murders, kidnaping, armed robbery and larceny was made within the
framework of the UAE laws and it called the EP to "view what is
going on in the UAE with a right eye."
</P>
<P>
The EP also blasted Bahrain, another GCC state on September
18, claiming that Manama's hash punishment against political
opposition groups violated human rights.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain said that the EP's criticism was based on false
claims made by a political opposition group that works to
distort Bahrain's reputation and the EP did not differentiate
between political opposition and terrorist groups.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Petr Korda and Richard Krajicek
entered the final of the Stuttgart Open after beating their
respective rivals in semi-finals on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Korda played a steady game to beat third-seeded Patrick Rafter
of Australia 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) in 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The defeat cost Rafter's chance of moving up to world number
two. The U.S. Open titlist could replace Michael Chang for the
number two position in ATP Tour rankings if he could win the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Korda had beaten Rafter twice in their previous three
encounters although the Australian had won the last match in the
semi-finals of the Grand Slam Cup in Munich last month.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion, beat Jonas Bjorkman 6-4,
3-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
The 16th-seeded Krajicek dropped his serve only once against
the 13th-seeded Bjorkman.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek then allowed no more lapses and broke Bjorkman for a
3-1 lead in the third set and held on to win the match.

<P>
BAGHDAD, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's National Assembly began
this morning discussing Iraqi-U.N. relations after the Security
Council passed a resolution threatening further sanctions in case
Baghdad does not cooperate with the U.N. special committee.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency said the members of the assembly's Arab,
international, legal, administration, oil and energy committees
held a joint meeting to study the topics arising from the
U.S. Security Council resolution 1134 "seriously and
comprehensively."
</P>
<P>
Speaker Saadoun Hammadi said Iraq, the people and government,
had hoped a U.N. Security Council resolution that does justice to
the Iraqi people and lift, or at least relax, the six-year-old
sanctions against it.
</P>
<P>
He lashed out at the U.S. government for continuing to infringe
upon the Iraqi security and safety and the life of the Iraqi
people through its aggressive policies and flagrant interference
in the activities of the U.N. Security Council and special
committee.
</P>
<P>
He asked the committee members of the National Assembly to make
detailed study and recommendations on the subject pending the
convention of a general session of the assembly later this evening.

<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein Friday presided over a joint
meeting of the Revolutionary Command Council and the Country
Leadership of the ruling Baath Party.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Security Forces Detain 1,000 in Colombo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan security forces
detained around 1,000 citizens in a track-down operation conducted
in the capital city of Colombo in early hours today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte in a statement
issued this evening said the operation was aimed at curbing the
threat posed to the capital, particular to the Tamil community, by
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
Police began to detain suspects after they cordoned the city.
By 8:00 am local time when the operation was concluded, a total of
around 1,000 people were under police custody.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said an unknown number of people were released
after being questioned. Others are kept in detention centers.
</P>
<P>
Ratwatte emphasized that at a time when the new constitution
reform package has been placed before the Parliament, the
government is very keen to flush out any LTTE rebels and prevent
any harm caused to the Tamil community.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Justice Minister G.L.Peiris on Friday submitted the
government's draft constitutional reform to the Parliament for
discussion.
</P>
<P>
The package contains proposals for establishment of a Union of
Regions with more autonomy given to local authorities in view of
ending the country's ethnic conflict between the majority Sinhala
and minority Tamil.
</P>
<P>
Ratwatte said: "The government wishes to reiterate that it
takes full responsibility for the security of all citizens and the
Tamil community in particular."
</P>
<P>
He added that precautions have been taken to avoid undue
inconvenience or any form of harassment to the detainees.
</P>
<P>
Security has been tightened up in Colombo following a powerful
bomb blast conspired by the LTTE rebels in the downtown area of
the capital on October 15.
</P>
<P>
A total of 18 people, including five Tigers shot dead by the
security forces, were killed and more than 100 were injured in the
incident. The explosion also caused great damage to many of the
landmark buildings in the business area.

<P>
CHENGDU, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, a high-ranking
official of the Communist Party of China (CPC), today urged
artists and cultural specialists to work diligently in the spirit
of the 15th National Congress of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Li, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the CPC Central Committee, chairman of the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
and honorary chairman of the Fifth China Arts Festival which
opened tonight in Chengdu, said the major task of artistic and
cultural work is to meet the growing cultural needs of the people.
</P>
<P>
Keeping to the orientation of serving the people and socialism,
he recalled, the cultural workers have produced a large number of
outstanding works through hard and diligent work and scored
gratifying achievements in recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "our work still falls short when compared to
the prosperity of material production and the demands of the broad
masses during this great age."
</P>
<P>
The goal for developing the arts is to serve the people who
are, in fact, the motive force behind the the development of art
itself, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he called on artists and cultural specialists to
emancipate their minds, dedicate themselves to their causes and
produce more and better artistic and cultural works.
</P>
<P>
The festival, the last of its kind the Chinese Government will
sponsor this century, will focus on patriotism, unity and
prosperity, as well as the amelioration of cultural and artistic
works, the demonstration of national culture and the
revitalization of national spirit, as well as celebrations of the
15th CPC National Congress and greeting the new century.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Security Belt in Northern Iraq Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Syrian newspapers today
condemned Turkey's carving of a security belt in northern Iraq,
its stationing of troops there and U.S. and Israeli military
equipment assistance to it.
</P>
<P>
The local daily "Teshrin" said Turkey established what it calls
"a security belt" inside the Iraqi territory with the help of
expertise of Israel, which had carved out its own security zone in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish move aims to bring pressure on Syria, Iraq and Iran
as well as the other Arab states in a bid to threaten the Arab
national security and impose a de facto control over Arab
resources, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
The design also aims to partition Iraq and block its national
unity; it will bring Israel directly on the northern Iraqi
territory under the guise of providing expertise to the Turkish
authorities. Turkey and Israel have agreed to strengthen military
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The so-called security belt is a clear proof of the
Israeli-Turkish alliance financed by the U.S.," said the official
Syrian paper "Al-Thawrah."
</P>
<P>
This aggressive design targets the Arabs and aims to divide
their national unity and territorial integrity, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It also aims to manipulate the economic resources of the Arabs
and marginalize their role in deciding the future of the region.
</P>
<P>
In alliance with Israel, Turkey will be acting on behalf of the
Jewish state to escalate tension in the region and easing
international pressure on Israel as a result of the anti-peace
policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, it added.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish-Israeli alliance indicates that the Turkish
military pushed Turkey to an anti-Arab and anti-Muslim position
and made the worst choice for the country, for Turkey's real
interest lies in the good-neighborly relations with Arab and the
regional countries," the paper concluded.

</P>
<P>
He said Lebanon would never give any guarantee to protect
security of Israel even if the regime implemented the U.N.
Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>

between Turkey and Israel, saying that Lebanon is against any
kind of cooperation between an Islamic State and Israel. He
also condemned Turkey's military action in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Greeting the Lebanese official at the airport, Iranian first
Vice President Hassan Habibi said Iran was keen on further
development of ties with Lebanon.

decisive role in promoting ties between the two countries,
especially in economic field.
</P>

Habibi also reiterated Iran's support for Lebanon, saying
that the Islamic Republic of Iran is for preservation of the
territorial integrity of countries, especially the friendly nations
and if Lebanon sought assistance from Iran, Iran would spare
no effort to help.

SHANGHAI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Economists from seven major

recent designation of Chongqing as a municipality have created
better conditions for economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Economists from the Wuhan branch of the People's Bank of China
said that the irrational approval of industrial projects in the
river valley have wasted the region's natural resources. They

<HEADLINE> HK Tourist Arrivals Slump in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals in Hong Kong
totaled just over 732,000 in September, erasing 22.4 percent over
the same month last year, the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA)
revealed today.
</P>
<P>
Combining the first nine months of this year together, visitor
figures totaled 7.9 million, down 6.5 percent over the same period
of 1996.
</P>
<P>
But the HKTA pointed out, though the latest arrivals figures
are still a cause for concern, some major markets are beginning to
show signs of recovery from the recent downturn.
</P>
<P>
In September, the Americas as a region showed an increase of
2.4 percent, with substantial rises from Canada, up 12.8 percent
and South and Central America, up 68.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since the handover, Hong Kong's
second-largest market, China's interior areas, recorded an
increase of 0.5 percent, the HKMA said.
</P>
<P>
However, Hong Kong's top and third-largest markets, Japan and
Taiwan, remained in their post-return slump, plunging by 61.7
percent and 18.5 percent respectively in September. This was due
mainly to the weakened economic situation in both markets, as well
as diminished interest in Hong Kong, which continues to affect
travel plans, said the HKMA.

<HEADLINE> US Sanctions on Iran Has no Effect: Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said here today that the U.S. sanctions on Iran would
have no effect and the United States could not impose its
own laws on other countries.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the remark at a press conference here as a
response to the U.S. threat to impose sanctions on countries
which would have cooperation with Iran in oil industry.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States imposed sanctions on Iran since
the beginning of the Islamic Revolution of Iran in 1979, however
relations between Iran and other countries have been improving.
</P>
<P>
This fact indicates that when the United States tries to
impose its own laws on others, the world would isolate itself,
Kharrazi said, adding that it is the United States which should
change its policy.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran and the French oil company Total have signed
oil cooperation document and it would also signed agreements with
other countries on oil cooperation in the future.
</P>
<P>
On relations between Iran and the United States, Kharrazi
said that Washington has not changed its policy towards Iran,
but some changes can been seen in the American society about
Iran, "so we are waiting to see if these changes would have
some effect on the U.S. policy toward Iran".
</P>
<P>
While denying any missile cooperation with China and Russia,
Kharrazi said that Iran has its own missile programs, and
Washington can not block Tehran from developing its own missiles.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the English daily "Tehran Times" today also issued
an editorial saying that the United States has been trying to use
sanctions as a foreign policy weapon but the policy has always
backfired on the United States due to changes in the contour of
international relations.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that it is time for the U.S. congress to
compensate past mistakes, adding that the D'Amato and Helms-Burton
laws passed by the congress have played havoc with U.S. prestige
and economy internationally.
</P>
<P>
Under the D'Amato Law signed by president Bill Clinton in 1996,
the U.S. would impose sanctions on foreign companies investing
more than 40 million U.S. dollars in Iran or Libya. The
investment cap in Iran reduced earlier this year to 20 million
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Sassou Sworn in as Congolese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Ex-military strong-man Denis
Sassou Nguesso, the winner of Congo Brazzaville's civil war in
the past four months, installed himself today as president after
his return to the capital, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
At the age of 54, Sassou took the oath of office in the
People's Palace parliament building in the Congolese capital
Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
Greeted by about 1,500 followers, Sassou said that national
forums would be organized shortly in Brazzaville to decide on the
length of the transition and on a date for national elections in
Congo, an oil-producing former colony of France.
</P>
<P>
He slammed ousted President Pascal Lissouba, who fled to
Burkina Faso for refuge after his defeat in mid-October in their
bloody power struggle which had claimed the death tolls of
thousands of civilians in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sassou said Lissouba would be pursued for crimes of genocide.
</P>
<P>
"A democracy of intimidation replaced a pluralist democracy
and a state of barbarism replaced a state of law," he charged,
referring to Lissouba's tenure after his 1992 victory in the
country's first multi-party presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Sassou, defeated in the first round of that poll, pledged
today to respect fundamental human rights and public liberties.
He said he would announce a national unity government within
days.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges EU to Exert "Constructive Pressure" on Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat today called on the European Union (EU) to exert
"constructive pressure" on Israel so as to break the deadlock in
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting here with German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel, Arafat said the failure of the Israeli government to
fulfill its commitments under peace agreements was the only reason
for the current deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is a strategic option not only for the Palestinian
people, but also for the Israeli people. It is a necessity for
the Arab world and the Middle East region. We must protect the
peace with all the possibilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that 70 percent of Israel's economy was linked to
Europe, Arafat called on the EU to use its economic clout to bring
pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We are calling for constructive pressure on Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the EU would put forward a new Middle
East peace initiative, which he said had won support from the
United States and has struck good resonance in the Arab world.
But he declined to reveal any details about the initiative.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference after the talks, Kinkel
pledged a bigger European role in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He also demanded an moratorium on Israel's construction of
Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, which he said was
"contrary to international law."
</P>
<P>
"Together with our European partners we are considering ways to
become politically more active in the Middle East," Kinkel said,
adding that this issue would be a central topic at a meeting of
the EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the new EU initiative mentioned by Arafat, Kinkel
said the EU was still in talks with the U.S. about the plan at the
moment and therefore he could not disclose anything concrete.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who ended his two-day visit to Germany today, also met
with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Opposition to Turkey's Actions in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi today reiterated Iran's opposition to Turkey's
cross-border military actions in northern Iraq, urging Ankara to
respect Iraq's sovereignty and integrity.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here Saturday morning, Kharrazi
said that Iran would not accept the decision of the Turkish
government to set up a "security strip" in northern Iraq, adding
that the Turkish decision would only damage the security and
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, around 15,000 Turkish troops, backed by air
cover and artillery fire, launched a cross-border incursion in
northern Iraq in a bid to attack the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) in the area.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has frequently launched cross-border operations aimed at
wiping out the PKK militants in northern Iraq over which Baghdad
had lost control since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 13-year separatist war for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has allegedly established a buffer zone in northern Iraq
in a new bid to seal its borders from hit-and-run attacks by
Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that Israel set up a security zone in south
Lebanon, but it did not serve to bring peace in the region, in
stead, it has created tensions.
</P>
<P>
The Israel's self-declared security zone in south Lebanon was
carved out in 1985 to protect its northern towns from guerrilla
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that the countries in the region had expressed
their concern over Turkish military actions in northern Iraq,
stressing that all Iraq's neighbors should respect Iraq's
sovereignty and integrity.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he would send his deputy to Turkey in the near
future to inform Turkey of Iran's stance on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi also criticized Turkey for signing military
cooperation agreements with Israel, saying that the cooperation
would not serve the Turkey's interests.
</P>
<P>
The military training agreements signed by Turkey and Israel in
early 1996 generated fear in the Middle East countries that Turkey
was aligning itself with Israel against Syria and other Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran would discuss the issue of northern Iraq with
Syria in order to establish stability in the region, but he denied
that Iran and Syria would take common action against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
On relations between Iran and Arab countries, Kharrazi said
that Iran had good relations with Arab countries, and he would
visit some Arab countries in near future to strengthen Iran's
relations with them, especially the Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
About the coming summit of the Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC) to be held here in December, Kharrazi said that
heads of states or representatives from 55 Muslim countries would
attend the summit to discuss issues in the Islamic world,
particularly in the Middle East.

BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said he will visit the United States with a friendly attitude and
with the hope for increasing friendship between the two peoples,
and expanding and strengthening common ground between the two
countries and their friendly relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang met with and answered questions from bureau chiefs of
U.S. media agencies on the eve of his state visit to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
There is no need for reticence concerning some differences
existing between the countries, said Jiang, adding that common
ground can be sought and differences preserved through dialog.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that my forthcoming visit will fulfill the goal of
increasing understanding, expanding common understanding,
developing cooperation and jointly building up the future," said
the president.
</P>
<P>
He described the U.S. as the world's most developed capitalist
country and China a major developing power. "The three joint
communiques between the two countries are the basis for
Sino-U.S. relations." said Jiang, adding that "we should properly
and earnestly implement the communiques. We still have a great
deal of work to do in this regard."
</P>
<P>
"We sincerly hope to further promote Sino-U.S. relations on
this basis," according to the Chinese president.
</P>
<P>
Jiang addressed bilateral trade by pointing to the fact that
trade ties between the two countries have enjoyed rapid progress
over recent years. He said that exports and imports between the
two nations weigh very heavily on China's external trade.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that Chinese economic and trade
cooperation delegations are currently visiting the U.S., and noted
that various factors account for the Sino-U.S. trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S. side to open more high-tech fields to China
so as to facilitate promoting the properly settlement of related
problems.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the issue concerning Hong Kong Stock Market, Jiang
said that market fluctuations are quite natural and are a common
phenomenon in markets throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Chinese economy, including the Hong Kong
economy, is stable. Jiang expressed full confidence in the fact
that no rational investor will harbor doubts about the Chinese
economy simply because of temporary fluctuations in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
Senior Chinese officials, including Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen, Zeng Qinghong, Liu Huaqiu, Teng Wensheng and

two nations weigh very heavily on China's external trade.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that Chinese economic and trade
cooperation delegations are currently visiting the U.S., and noted
that various factors account for the Sino-U.S. trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S. side to open more high-tech fields to China
so as to facilitate promoting the properly settlement of related
problems.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the issue concerning Hong Kong Stock Market, Jiang
said that market fluctuations are quite natural and are a common
phenomenon in markets throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Chinese economy, including the Hong Kong
economy, is stable. Jiang expressed full confidence in the fact
that no rational investor will harbor doubts about the Chinese
economy simply because of temporary fluctuations in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
Senior Chinese officials, including Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen, Zeng Qinghong, Liu Huaqiu, Teng Wensheng and
Li Zhaoxing, attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Yellow River Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAOLANGDI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Yellow River, China's
second longest river, is not only revered as the cradle of Chinese
civilization, but is also known as the scourge of the nation due
to frequent disasters.
</P>
<P>
Recorded history of over 2,500 years shows that the river has
flooded in more than 540 years, with its banks breached on 1,500
different occasions. The course of the river has changed 26 times.
</P>
<P>
Disasters have affected an area covering 250,000 sq.km. from
Tianjin in the north to the Yangtze River in the south.
</P>
<P>
The latest flood occured in 1938 when the Kuomintang Government
led by Chiang Kai-shek bombed the banks of the river at Zhengzhou
to repel invading Japanese forces. Some 800,000 people died in
ensuing floods.
</P>
<P>
China has strengthened dams and dikes, built reservoirs in the
upper and middle reaches of the river and constructed containment
areas in lower reaches since the founding of New China in 1949. No
breaches in the river banks have been recorded for more than half
a century.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, silting continues to pose a serious problem, with
sedimentation raising the river bed in the lower reaches by some
10 centimeters per year. Therefore the river is also known as the
"Hanging River."
</P>
<P>
Flood control facilities along the river currently have the
capacity to deal with a 60-year flood.
</P>
<P>
The lower reaches of the river feature a dense population and
are home to over ten major cities, including Zhengzhou, Kaifeng
and Jinan. The area is also the convergence of China's major
railways. The Zhongyuan and Shengli oil fields, as well as the
Yanji and Huaibei coal mines, and vast areas of farmland also
highlight the need for major efforts to combat natural disasters
in the area.

<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Senate Republicans have started moving quickly to confirm a
backlog of nominations for sub-Cabinet officers, ambassadors and
judges after being pummeled for weeks by the White House over the
slow pace in approving nominees.
</P>
<P>
-- The Senate again failed to end an impasse over campaign
finance legislation that is blocking several other bills. Senate
Democrats continued to filibuster a six-year 145 billion-dollar
highway spending bill, underscoring their demand to schedule a
debate and votes on a campaign finance bill for early next year.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A proposal to create a modified form of national education
standards appeared to be moving House and Senate leaders closer to
settling their sharp differences over the issue Friday. The
dispute has been holding up passage of the largest domestic
spending bill for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
-- A Democratic-led effort to force House action on campaign
finance legislation go off to a quick start Friday but is still
well short of the finish line.

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijan Resumes Oil Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijan resumed its oil
exports today after a suspension of 32 years, with crude oil
beginning to flow across the Russian border to reach the world
market.
</P>
<P>
The northern pipeline, which was opened at 13:10 Moscow time,
links Baku and Novorossisk via Grozny and Tikhoretsk, said an
Interfax news service report from Baku, Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony to mark the beginning of Azerbaijani oil exports via
the northern route was held near the village of Shirvanovka, the
end point of the Azerbaijani section of the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
President of the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijani Republic
(SOCAR) Natik Aliyev described the event as a special occasion.
</P>
<P>
"Today," Aliyev told the ceremony, "Azerbaijan resumes the
export of oil to Western markets after a break of 65 years, and
resumes it in the most profitable and reliable way: by pipeline."
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijani oil had previously been exported to the world
market along the Baku-Batumi pipeline, which was shut down in 1932.
</P>
<P>
The Baku-Novorossisk pipeline is 1,411 kilometers long, and its
Azerbaijani section, including a new line from a coastal terminal
in Sangachaly near Baku to Sumgait, is 260 kilometers long.
</P>
<P>
The date for beginning the oil transportation was reportedly
delayed for more than once over repairs on the 153-kilometer
Chechen section, which was completed only recently.
</P>
<P>
The first 40,000 metric tons of Azerbaijani export oil, to be
shipped overseas at the rate of 2,500 ton a day, were bought by
Russia's Lukoil company at 130 U.S. dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
Lukoil company purchased the oil under an international bidding
procedure. According to the Interfax report, the SOCAR plans
export 120,000 tons of crude oil before the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Slams Libya for Weapon Supply to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Somali faction led by
Ali Mahdi Mohamed today condemned Tripoli for supplying weapons
and ammunition to his rival in south Mogadishu Hussein Mohamed
Aidid, who has just returned from a week-long visit to Libya.
</P>
<P>
According to a press statement signed by Hussein Hagi Bod,
deputy chairman for Ali Mahdi's faction, it has been confirmed
that a large consignment of both heavy and small arms were
delivered to Hussein Aidid's faction by Libya.
</P>
<P>
The statement accused the Libyan government of violating the
weapon embargo imposed by the United Nations on Somalia in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The document signed by Bod blamed Libya for continuously
threatening the security of the Somali people by financing and
rearming Hussein Aidid's faction to instigate violence.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi and Hussein Aidid are two warlords out of the three
main rival factions in war-torn Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the National Salvation Council recently
established in Ethiopia, Bod called on the Libyan government to
refrain from the destructive initiatives it has so far been
leading toward Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid refuses to attend the national reconciliation
conference proposed by the 26 parties of the council recently.
</P>
<P>
Libya, one of the countries chosen by the Arab League for
finding solution for Somalia, should not at least work vice
versa, said Bod, who appealed to the international community to
observe and strengthen the weapon embargo on Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The condemnation and appeal by Ali Mahdi's faction are
prompted by strong rumors indicating that Hussein Aidid's faction
received, only two days ago, consignment of weapons and
ammunition including three Russian-made mine sweepers.
</P>
<P>
The arms allegedly included a number of double barrel
anti-aircraft heavy machine guns preferred by the militiamen for
the use against the infantry gunmen and civilians here in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Militia confidential sources said, the mine sweepers and the
anti-aircraft guns arrived at Ballidogle Airport, 90 km south of
the capital Mogadishu, on a cargo plane which brought them from
Odweyne town of the break-away Republic of Somaliland controlled
by Aidid's deputy, Abdurahman Ahmed Ali Tuur.
</P>
<P>
Other unconfirmed reports said the weapons were brought by
Somali merchants from the former Soviet Republic of Ukraine for
sale here in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
However, Hussein Aidid's faction denied importing any weapons
from any foreign country. Libya enjoys a close relationship with
Hussein Mohamed Aidid's self-styled government and maintains an
"embassy" in south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Libya are the only foreign countries that recognize
Hussein Aidid and have diplomatic missions in Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Mutual Respect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- China and the U.S. should
respect each other's concepts of values despite differences in
economic development and historical and cultural traditions,
according to Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks during a meeting with bureau chiefs from
U.S. press agencies on the eve of his departure for a state visit
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people have always respected the over 200-year
history of the United States," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He cited the importance for the two countries to learn from
each other, and stressed that "China has consistently opened its
door to the world, including the U.S., since implementation of the
reform and opening policies" almost two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
China can learn from the advanced science, technology and
management experiences of the US, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's history stretches over several thousand
years, and noted that many Americans have exhibited great interest
in the country's history and culture.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also pointed to new inventions and progress in China's
scientific and technological sector.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president pointed out that China has actively
promoted political and economic restructuring since the Third
Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party. The restructuring in the two respects is mutually
accommodating and promoting, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The recent 15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist
Party further clarified that China will continue to promote
political restructuring, expand socialist democracy, improve the
socialist legal system, rule the country in line with law, and
construct a socialist country ruled by law." said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that countries differ from each other in terms of
specific situations and conditions. "It is undemocratic to demand
that all countries follow a uniform political pattern," according
to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He cited the old Chinese saying -- "Seeing is believing," and
expressed hope that friendly contacts will ensure that people in
China and the U.S.can deepen mutual undersanding.

<P>
NANJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A small farm in east China's
Jiangsu Province has become a supplier of rice to American beer
giant -- Budweiser's solely-owned venture in China.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Budweiser ordered 500 tons of rice from the Sanhe
Farm to replace much expensive rice imported from the US for its
venture in central China's Hubei Province. The purchase is
expected to rise this year over last year.
</P>
<P>
"They (Budweiser) like the rice of our farm because they found
its quality better than that of the rice grown in the US,", a
source from the farm was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Located in the less-developed Xuyi County, the farm has made
great efforts to introduce large-scale mechanized farming in
recent years, enabling the degree of its farm mechanization to
reach over 92 percent.

<P>
DALIAN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Dalian Rolling Stock Plant,
China's leading locomotive exporter, recently sold six
1,476-kilowatt locomotives to Nigeria, bringing its overseas sales
of high-power locomotives to 24 sets.
</P>
<P>
These locomotives, which were sold to Nigeria, Iran, Tanzania,
and Zambia in five batches, earned the plant more than 32 million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
To date, the plant, which accounts for half of the country's
locomotive output, has received foreign orders on over 80
locomotives, of which 32 have been delivered.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Dongfeng-4B diesel locomotive was designated by
the state as an import substitute, thus putting an end to China's
reliance on foreign locomotives.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the plant has produced more than 2,200
locomotives, saving the state over one billion US dollars from
imports.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Work is proceeding smoothly and
quietly at Xiaolangdi multi-purpose water conservation project
just before the scheduled river damming.
</P>
<P>
Some 40,000 people living in the dam areas to be submerged have
moved to newly built resettlement villages.
</P>
<P>
A 100-meter-high dam has blocked more than half of the main
course of the Yellow River, the second longest river in China,
which is to be dammed completely on Oct. 28. Trucks automatically
file to the riverside to dump stones into the water.
</P>
<P>
Progress reports are announced daily on a blackboard hung in
the entrance hall of the Yellow River Water and Hydro Power
Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
All necessary preparations are proceeding smoothly and targets
set for all sectors have been fulfilled on schedule, said Wang
Xianru, deputy general manager of the Xiaolangdi Engineering
Consulting Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
More than 110 journalists from 30 countries and regions are
expected to come to Luoyang, the site of the Xiaolangdi project to
cover the event. The largest crew of journalists will be from the
China Central Television Station.
</P>
<P>
Yellow River, known to the world as the cradle of the Chinese
nation, has been the source of heavy flooding in the past five
decades, claiming 800,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Damming Nears for Xiaolangdi Water Control Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAOLANGDI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking water
conservation official has predicted that the river damming will be
successful for the Xiaolangdi water control project.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jirao, Chinese vice-minister of Water Resources said that
the most difficult work will be over when the river is blocked on
Sunday. His remarks came during an inspection today at the work
site here.
</P>
<P>
A command office was set up today for Sunday's damming,
scheduled for 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the Yellow River's flow recorded today is
much lower than the standard required for the damming, making
Sunday's work much easier.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaolangdi project, which cost 40 billion yuan (4.8 billion
U.S. dollars) to build, is China's second largest water control
and hydro-power undertaking and the largest on the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The project is partly funded by World Bank loans of more than
1.1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
After the river is blocked, construction will begin on the
154-meter-high, 1,317-meter-long dam. The first generating unit is
expected to begin producing electricity in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Reporters from more than 30 countries and regions have gathered
here to observe the damming.
</P>
<P>
Longkou, site of the project, has taken on a festive look with
colorful electric lights and red lanterns hung on the streets and
buildings.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Supervisors Win Respect of Foreign Contractors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAOLANGDI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A contingent of 400 Chinese
engineering supervisors has played an important role in the
construction of Xiaolangdi multi-purpose dam project on the Yellow
River.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolangdi is the first project in China to be performed under
the provisions of Fidic, an internationally acknowledged
contract. Chinese supervisors strictly followed the CCC principles
-- Contract, Cooperation and Carefulness -- in winning universal
praise from overseas partners.
</P>
<P>
Wu Xi, a supervisor in charge of the dam project, is a
representative. He has been working conscientiously since he came
to Xiaolangdi three years ago.
</P>
<P>
He deems that a supervisor shoulders the responsibility of
performing contracts fairly, controlling the rate of work progress
and supervising the project's quality.
</P>
<P>
Wu is fully efficient, said a colleague. No matter how many
contracts he receives a day, he finished all of them the same day.
</P>
<P>
In handling disputes between contractors and project owners, Wu
can stick to his principles while consulting with both side in a
realistic and friendly manner, which he uses to get agreement by
all sides, said Massimo Malvagna, a manager from the Impregelo
Company of Italy.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolangdi, the second largest water conservation project in
China, was built with loans of over 1.1 billion U.S. dollars from
the World Bank. Hydraulic engineering teams have come from all
over the world to work on the project.

<HEADLINE> African Center for Civil Society Launched in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The African Center for
Civil Society (ACCS) was officially launched at the U.N.
conference center here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The center was established by the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA) in a bid to fulfill the goals set by
the African Charter for population participation.
</P>
<P>
Dawit Yohannes, speaker of the House of People's
Representatives of Ethiopia, said at Friday's ceremony that the
initiative was of great significance as the "potential for the
emergence of vibrant civil society in Africa is buttressed by
national constitutions and conventions which accorded to it legal
recognition and protection."
</P>
<P>
"The creation of ACCS is the correct step for the aims and
objectives of putting mass participation in decision making
across the continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
K.Y. Amoako, Executive Secretary of the ECA, said on the
occasion that states become more effective when they are
attentive and listen to "business and citizens and work in
partnership toward a special goal."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the center will deepen the
commitment made by the United Nations, particularly through the
U.N. system-wide special initiative on Africa, to bolster civil
society on the continent for peace and development.
</P>
<P>
"With goodwill and help from all concerned, millions of
Africans and their organizations will benefit from the work of
ACCS," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The center, conceived some 11 years ago, was shaped by the
"enabling environment conference" held by the Aga Khan Foundation
in Nairobi and subsequent gatherings on civil society and good
governance.
</P>
<P>
The principal objectives of ACCS are to enhance cooperation
between African governments and civil society, strengthen the
capacity of civil society organizations, and enhance their
technical capacity in conflict prevention and resolution.

<P>
LAGOS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- About 70 percent of Nigerians
are poor, with 48 to 50 percent of them belonging to "moderate
poor" and 20 percent "core poor", a recent survey by the
country's Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) showed.
</P>
<P>
This indicated an increase of the "core poor" from 16 percent
to 20 percent in the last five years as against a reduction in
the number of the rich during the same period, said FOS
Director-General Oladejo Ajayi.
</P>
<P>
But he gave neither the percentage of the country's rich
people nor details of the time and method the survey was carried
out, according to the official newspaper New Nigerian today.
</P>
<P>
FOS is a government agency in charge of collecting, processing
and disseminating statistical data.
</P>
<P>
At a workshop earlier this week in Uyo, capital of south
Nigeria's Akwa Ibom state, the FOS chief also urged Nigerians to
desist from giving false information on statistics.

<P>
XIAOLANGDI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The damming of the Yellow
River, the largest water control project on China's second longest
waterway, is ready to go Sunday as scheduled, a high-ranking water
conservation official said today. All technical requirements have
been met, said Zhang Jirao, Chinese vice-minister of Water
Resources.
</P>
<P>
Zhang told reporters here today that all seven indices for the
engineering quality of the dam were deemed "fine" in expert
examinations, which is quite rare for previous large water control
projects.
</P>
<P>
Another good sign is the fact that 40 percent of the
engineering has been completed prior to the damming, while the
usual rate is 10-to-15 percent; and the complicated technical
problems have nearly all been resolved.
</P>
<P>
The river damming will be undertaken by foreign contractors,
showing that China has found a way of international engineering
management acceptable to foreign contractors as well as satisfying
China's conditions, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Police Make Biggest Seizure of Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Police in northern Thailand
made the country's biggest ever seizure of narcotics earlier this
week when they discovered more than 1 million amphetamine tablets
and 40 kilograms of heroin hidden in a van.
</P>
<P>
Acting on a tip-off, police set up a checkpoint on a main road
in Chiang Rai, Thailand's northernmost province, and intercepted
the van carrying the drugs.
When police flagged a black van heading for the checkpoint to
stop, the van turned back and sped up, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
After 10 minutes' chase, police stopped the van and searched
it, finding 1.01 million amphetamine tablets and 57 bars of
first-grade heroin weighing 40 kilograms hidden in a secret
compartment of the van.
</P>
<P>
The drugs can be sold at a total of 150 million baht (3.85
million U.S. dollars) in the street, the Bangkok Post today quoted
police as saying.
</P>
<P>
The driver, Kittisak Wongchan, 33, was arrested. He told police
that he had been hired to transport the drugs from Mae Sai, a
border town in Chiang Rai, to a dealer in Thailand's capital
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Rai is part of the infamous opium-producing "golden
triangle" and police believe that a drug-running gang is operating
in Mae Sai on the Thai-Myanmar border.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Thai police found 598,000 amphetamine
tablets in a BMW car in the northern province of Phayao. The
driver told a similar story about being hired to deliver the
drugs.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Army Extends Amnesty for Deserters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Army has decided
that an amnesty for army deserters, which was effective from
October 10 to midnight Friday, will be extended to midnight
October 31, a military spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
By midnight Friday, more than 1,500 deserters had reportedly
returned for duty, Military Spokesman Ink Dewage said.
</P>
<P>
He added that on the last day of the amnesty, a total of 824
deserters returned.
</P>
<P>
The army decided to extend the amnesty at the request of many
parents and relatives of deserters, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Unless the deserters report back by October 31, they will be
arrested by the military police and civil police and be tried by
the Court Of Martial, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that people who harbor or provide employment to
deserters would be severely dealt with once found guilty of doing
so.

will not be punished and will resume their previously held ranks
and pay effective from the day of their return.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Xiaolangdi Water Control Project Sets Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAOLANGDI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Xiaolangdi Water Control
Project, one of the most challenging in the world, has set world
and national records in project design and construction.
</P>
<P>
The project has been challenging because of its complex
geological structure, large scale, and engineering difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The intake tower, 275 meters long and 113 meters high with 16
tunnels buried under the left bank of the river, is the largest
and most complex of its kind in the world, said Lin Xiushan,
president of the Survey, Planning, Design and Research Institute
of the Yellow River Conservation Commission under the Ministry of
Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
Work on the intake tower has been completed and the water
diversion project has put into operation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The project has the largest rock-fill dam in China with a height
of 1,317 meters; the deepest concrete cutoff wall, which is
inserted 70 meters into the river bed; and the largest underground
power house, which is 250 meters long and 61 meters high (equal to
a 25-storey building).
</P>
<P>
Technical problems have been resolved in such areas as silting
at the mouth of the water diversion tunnel, stability of the
intake tower, prevention of dam leakage and the abrasion caused by
the high-speed flow of sand-bearing water in the bottom outlet,
Lin said.

<HEADLINE> WFP Task Force to Tackle El Nino Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
has established a task force to address the ecological threat
posed by the weather changes affecting most parts of the African
continent, the Kenya Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the phenomenon commonly known as El Nino
could cause a disaster in Southern Africa where drought is
imminent.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency said in a press statement that there were
fears of diminished rainfall in Southern Africa and especially in
the dozen of Southern Africa Development Community (SADC)
countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that we are facing an ecological disaster that
could affect millions of people. Already there are signs of
drought of varying intensity in central America, China and Papua
New Guinea," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon has also been explained as the cause of the
torrential rains in the coastal region of Kenya where more than
20 lives have already been lost and a lot of property damaged.
</P>
<P>
The region has received 750 mm of rainfall within seven days
this month, while its usual October average is 97 mm, the paper
noted.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorological Department of Kenya has predicted that the
coastal area of this east African country would receive heavier
rains in the next two weeks and a similar rainfall trend was
expected in Western and Nyanza provinces in west Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi Friday declared Coast
Province a disaster zone following the week-long torrential rains
which have wreaked havoc in the region.
</P>
<P>
The WFP called on donor nations to demonstrate the same
generosity they displayed five years ago when they helped avert a
major humanitarian disaster in Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the WFP has already approved a
regional emergency operation covering all SADC countries at a
cost of 316 million U.S. Dollars to provide 712,000 tons of aid
food.

<HEADLINE> Water Supply Threatened by Misuse in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Misuse of Kenya's water
resources has posed a threat to the supply in the next century,
the Kenya National Academy of Sciences says.
</P>
<P>
Water consumption, both in agriculture and industry, would
have greatly outstripped supply by the next century in this
eastern African country, Jackton Ojwang', treasurer of the
academy, was quoted as saying by a local report issued today.
</P>
<P>
Water is scarce, yet a rise in demand is imminent in the 21st
century, indicating the pending conflict between availability of
water and its distribution when it comes to permit allocation,
warned Albert Mumma, an environmental lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 percent of the current water abstractions had no
permits in the country and inspectors rarely monitored those that
have, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Bribes and low penalties also encouraged policy breakers, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
A possible solution was to streamline administrative and other
relevant machineries for prevention and pollution control, said
Maurice Ndege, director of Africa Water Network.
</P>
<P>
There should be incentives and tax exemption for those who
treat their waste to required standards before discharging it,
said the scientist, who called for introduction of legal regimes
for organizational distribution of water.
</P>
<P>
Economic water usage is vital for 21st century's Kenya, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Average water consumption in Kenya was 132 liters per person
per day while agriculture consumed 69 percent of the country's
water.
</P>
<P>
The state possesses 20 million cubic kilometers of fresh
water.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAOLANGDI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Xiaolangdi water control
project has attracted overseas investors to provide funding.
</P>
<P>
The dam project, the largest on the Yellow River, will receive
1.16 billion U.S. dollars in loans from the World Bank. Bids were
received from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Seven-hundred people from more than 50 countries and regions
are working at the Xiaolangdi construction site.
</P>
<P>
"We need not only foreign funds, but also advanced technology
and equipment for the Xiaolangdi project," said Wang Xianru,
assistant general manager of the Yellow River Water and Hydropower
Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
China is keeping with the accepted practice of other countries
in constructing the project. At Xiaolangdi, both engineers and
workers are proceeding under contracts instead of administrative
orders, he said. John Anderson, a Canadian consultant, said this
has been influenced by global trends.
</P>
<P>
China, a country with a foreign exchange reserve of 120 billion
U.S. dollars, is negotiating with the World Bank on the use of
loans for building other projects in China. In the field of
conservation, 90 percent of water resources in the country remain
untapped.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government encourages overseas companies to invest
in infrastructures, basic industries and key projects, deemed by
experts, as trades which generate slow economic returns but have
less risk and more stable profit.
</P>
<P>
British contractor Barry Crouchman said China is one of the
largest markets and fastest-growing economies in the world. He
said that his company wanted to enhance its prestige in China by
involving in Xiaolangdi project.
</P>
<P>
The Song International Trading Company Ltd., winner of a bid
for the Xiaolangdi project, has signed a contract with the Chinese
for the Three Gorges dam project.
</P>
<P>
According to a World Bank report, China has attracted an
estimated 204 billion U.S. dollars of foreign funds through
August, ranking second in the world. It will continue to be an
area receiving priority for global investment, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian miners assured of continued employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambia consolidated Copper
Mines (ZCCM) privatization chairman Francis Kaunda has reaffirmed
that the more than 10,000 ZCCM employees will not lose their jobs
after the mines are privatized.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted him as saying on Friday that
this was contained in negotiations with potential buyers as one
of the cardinal conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said 90 percent of the discussions on the sale of Nchanga,
Mufulira and Knana have been concluded.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues that have not been resolved is the
retrenchment aspect, which his team has put its foot down and is
not going to back-pedal on, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it has been made clear to all interested parties that
no workers shall be retrenched after the sale of the mines.
</P>
<P>
"We have been very clear on this matter. We are not going to
sell ZCCM and leave the workers in the cold. The deal is that
every body should be taken on and we shall not shift from that
position in our negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the sale of ZCCM was an intricate matter which
should be done with caution as the repercussion of being careless
will be gross.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda also revealed that the amount of money that has been
raised from the already sold mines is far in excess of what has
been put up in the original bids.
</P>
<P>
He refuted allegations that the mines have been sold at
unrealistically low prices.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said the privatization of the mines, which earns the
country 80 percent of its foreign exchanges, is on schedule and
negotiations are going ahead despite a few contentious issues.

Impragilo Company of Italy, said, "We are fully prepared for the
success of the damming"
</P>
<P>
Xiaolangdi has prepared 400,000 cubic meters of stones, which
will be dumped into the mouth of the dam at a speed of 2,800 cubic
meters per hour between Oct. 26 and 28, he said.

<HEADLINE> OAU Calls for Military Coop in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) wants to encourage cooperation between defense forces
on the continent in order to ensure peace and security are
preserved, OAU chief Salim Ahmed Salim said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing SADC peace-keeping course here Friday, Salim said
Africa is keen to pursue this initiative so that major
catastrophes can be avoided.
</P>
<P>
The future of conflict prevention, management and resolution
in Africa depends on the establishment of a viable indigenous
capacity for peace operations and the standardization of African
peace-keeping training, to help countries act together during
times of crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Forty-five participants drawn from southern Africa were given
their certificates Friday after successfully completing the third
regional peace-keeping course, which ran concurrently with the
meeting of chiefs of defense staff in Harare.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general said, although OAU member states had on
some occasions been reluctant to involve themselves in
peace-support operations, the continental body and some
sub-regional organizations had mounted historic peace operations.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, the issue of African countries preparing and
training their civilians, civil police and military personnel
become of vital importance to the success of any African
undertaking in the area of peace support operations. We need to
embark on joint initiatives that will enhance the level of
preparedness for peace missions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Salim commended Zimbabwe for taking the initiative, saying
"The shining examples should provide inspiration to succeeding
generations of Africans in our march toward consolidating the
efforts aimed at conflict prevention, management and resolution
in Africa."

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange (KLSE) ended sharply lower on persistent foreign selling
this week.
</P>
<P>
The 100-quality stocks Composite Index (CI) declined 102.41
points to 692.39, a four-year low since it last recorded 692.57 on
April 27, 1993, at the close of the week's trading as a result of
the lower local currency exchange rate and regional concerns.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit touched a low of 3.430 to the U.S. dollar, but
managed to recover to 3.3620/70 during the week from 3.2200/00

<P>
The benchmark even hit an intraday low of 682.86 on Friday, the
last trading day of the week. However, the level was not the
lowest for this year, as the CI touched an intraday low of 675.15
on September 4 because of speculative attack on the local currency

</P>
<P>
On the KLSE, the mainboard volume totaled 1.021 billion shares
worth 1.021 billion ringgit (about 309.3939 million U.S. dollars)

</P>
<P>
The second board turnover was 139.332 million shares worth
1.041 billion ringgit (about 315.4545 million dollars) from
225.909 million shares valued at 1.940 billion ringgit (about
587.8787 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The off-market deals fell to 106.392 million shares worth
934.352 million ringgit (about 283.1369 million dollars) against
116.369 million shares valued at 1.102 billion ringgit (about
333.9393 million dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
There were no listings or suspension of any counters this week.
</P>
<P>
The 10 most active counters included Sime Darby, down 1.38
ringgit at 4.92 ringgit; Innovest, up 5 sen to 8.3 ringgit; MRCB,

crude palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week all
higher.

<P>
However, October South closed the week higher by 60 ringgit
(about 18.18 U.S. dollars) to 1,660 ringgit (about 503.03 dollars)

On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM), tin price closed the
week higher by 15 sen to 17.96 ringgit (about 5.44 dollars) per kg
against last week's close at 17.81 ringgit (about 5.39 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Trading was choppy on the KLTM this week, but active with the
accumulated turnover surging to 449 tons against 358 tons last
week.
</P>
<P>
On the Malaysian rubber market, November RSS One closed the
week 10.5 sen higher at 289.5 sen (about 87 cents) per kg and SMR
20 surged by 9 sen to 287 sen (about 86 cents) per kg.

market indicator price for October 23 was at 211.74
Malaysian/Singapore cents per kg against 205.09 cents on October
16.

<HEADLINE> Decrees to Reform Thai Finance Sector Takes Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Six long-awaited decrees for
reforming Thailand's financial sector took effect today after
having been approved by the cabinet and the king last week.
</P>
<P>
Two of the decrees will establish the Financial Restructuring
Authority (FRA) and the Asset Management Corporation (AMC).
</P>
<P>
The two agencies will oversee and manage the bad debts held by
the 58 finance companies suspended by the government in June and
August for their huge amounts of bad debts.
</P>
<P>
Under the decrees on FRA and AMC, suspended firms unable to
boost capital or merge with other firms would be liquidated and
their assets transferred to the AMC.
</P>
<P>
The AMC would sell the assets to other financial institutions
or investors, at a deep discount in order to expedite the reform
process and minimize the overall cost to the government.
</P>
<P>
A selloff could be pushing market prices down for land and
property developments, which represent most of the assets held by
the suspended firms.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors also expressed interest in purchasing assets
from the AMC, rather than investing capital to rehabilitate the
suspended firms.
</P>
<P>
The other four decrees have amended acts regulating the Bank of
Thailand, commercial banking, finance, securities and credit
financier business.
</P>
<P>
The changes contained in the amendments include regulations in
line with the government's pledge to guarantee deposits and
creditors, and allow tax deductions for provisioning against loan
losses.
</P>
<P>
Operators of finance companies have pinned much hope on these
royal decrees and wished that the enforcement will ensure fair
treatment of both operating and suspended finance firms.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Develop Ties With Russia: Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian legislature adopted
today a declaration on developing relations with Russia on the
basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria will develop relations with Russia in a spirit of
friendship, mutual interest and equality, said the "Declaration on
Developing Equal and Mutually Advantageous Relations between
Bulgaria and the Russian Federation".
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's trade and economic relations with Russia should be
based on cooperation and transparency, without political
preconditions and without intermediaries, in full respect of the
Bulgarian interest, said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
The document added Bulgaria attaches special importance to its
relations with Russia in the energy sector and infrastructure
projects and will develop them by showing respect for the two
countries' sovereign rights.
</P>
<P>
President Petar Stoyanov, who is scheduled to visit Moscow in
December, said at the parliament that the clearer the two
countries' relations, the more certain they can be of success.

<P>

expectations of the majority of Bulgarians.

<HEADLINE> Commerce Chambers Call for Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Associated Chambers of
Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) has called for
introducing a second package of economic reforms to halt decline
in industrial growth and revive business confidence.
</P>
<P>
In a background paper on "Reinventing Industrial Surge,"
Assocham expressed concern that the slowdown in industry has
spread to almost all sectors and business confidence has touched
an all-time low despite some recent government policy initiatives,
Assocham sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Estimates of industrial production index indicate a growth rate
of 6.4 percent in the April-July period of fiscal 1997-98 as
against 10.5 percent a year earlier. There is a decline in the
growth rate of basic, capital, intermediate and consumer goods as
well as consumer durable and non-durable goods, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the key areas which need urgent attention are the
fiscal deficit, governmental finances, social sector,
infrastructure development, foreign trade and industrial policies.
A properly-laid time schedule for completing the reform process in
any given sector is needed to avoid further slippage on the reform
front.
</P>
<P>
One important area of concern is the inadequacy of India's
infrastructure, the paper said. While domestic resource
mobilization and capital inflows can accelerate economic growth,
infrastructure bottlenecks could threaten the sustainability of
such growth, the Assocham sources said.
</P>
<P>
India started its economic reforms in 1991-92 when the Congress
government headed by P. V. Narasimha Rao was in power.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- An Atlas 2A rocket sent into
space a communications satellite for the U.S. Department of
Defense Friday evening from Florida.
</P>
<P>
The rocket lifted off its Cape Canaveral launch pad at 8:46
p.m. (0046 GMT) and released the Defense Satellite Communications
System (DSCS) satellite, a crucial link in the U.S. military's
world-wide communications network, into an egg-shaped temporary
orbit about 27 minutes after launch.
</P>
<P>
The 6,000-pound (2,721 kg) spacecraft was to later fire an
on-board rocket motor to raise it into a circular 22,300 mile
(6,800 km) high orbit.
</P>
<P>
It was launched by the Lockhead Martin Corporation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Air Force officials refused to disclose the final location
of the satellite, which will replace an older model, constructed
nearly 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
But a U.S. Army Space Command said it was the most important
satellite in the Pentagon's communications world.
</P>
<P>
The DSCS satellites provided secure, jam-proof communication
links for the U.S. armed forces during the Gulf War. Since then
the use of the system has tripled and is currently in use by U.S.
troops in Bosnia, the official said.

saying.

These three weapons systems form part of the Defense Research

he said.

The Army is also increasing the number of Milan anti-tank
missiles as a replacement for the jeep-mounted 106 mm recoil-less

Los Angeles, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Possible vandalism that
might have caused a predawn power outage Thursday in much of San
Francisco is now under the investigation of the FBI's
counter-terrorism task force, local news reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&AMP;E), while not ruling out
equipment problem, called in police and the FBI to look into
possible sabotage in a key transmission substation at Mission
Street, where five transformers stopped working at 6:15 a.m..
</P>
<P>
The three-and-half-hour outage cut electricity to 126,000
customers in much of the northern half of the city.
</P>
<P>
All over town, when people were getting up and preparing to go
to work or school, streetlights went out, traffic signals failed
and Municipal Railway lines stopped working. Until full power
restored later, the routine of life was touched by chaos, anxiety
and frustration.
</P>
<P>
Tests after the outage showed that no mechanical problems have
been found, officials said. This bolstered the possibility of
vandalism.
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman George Grotz said that it did not appear to be an
accident, adding that investigators were looking at the building's
logs to see who entered recently.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economy to Grow 5 Percent in 1997-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economic growth in
fiscal 1997-98 (from April 1, 1997 to March 31, 1998) is estimated
to be at least 5 percent, 2.8 percent lower than the previous year
because of the current monetary crisis, an observer said.
</P>
<P>
"But with a population growth of 1.6 percent, the 5-percent
economic growth could still contribute to the improvement of the
people's welfare," Chairman of the Indonesian Economic Scholars
Association Marzuki Usman said here Friday at the 22nd Conference
of the Federation of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) Economic Association.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's economic growth in 1998-99 is also estimated at 5
percent, sources at the meeting today quoted Marzuki as saying.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy has been affected by the monetary crisis
which has hit hard most Southeast Asian currencies since early
July this year. The value of the rupiah, Indonesia's currency, has
dropped by about 50 percent against the U.S. dollar in the last 10
months.
</P>
<P>
The sectors suffering the biggest drops in growth following the
crisis are finance, transportation and telecommunication services,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sectors which are affected most by the current tight
monetary policy and the monetary crisis are construction and
building services.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki said that after these years, Indonesia's economic
growth is expected to bounce back to the 7-percent level. The
"test" on the economy will continue in the next two years, after
which the country should have learned how to deal with it, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that human resources will play a very important
role in the globalization era.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The conference was participated by some 200 representatives
from Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and
the host country, Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Italy Plans to Cut More Than 28,000 Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government is going to
cut 28,000 troops and shut down several command and training
centers by the year of 2000, according to a decree approved
Thursday by the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
This effort is aimed at putting into effect a new defense model
in which the army, navy and air force will be leaner, more
flexible, able to coordinate better with each other and integrate
themselves more closely with those of Italy's allies.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree, the army will lose some 20,000 men and women,
while the air force 7,500 and the navy 920. The armed forces'
seven regional command centers will be cut to three, covering
Italy's north, center and south.
</P>
<P>
Among the four command centers to be closed are the navy's
command office in Naples, 2nd Air Command and the
Telecommunication and Flight Assistance Inspectorate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three autonomous centers will be set up in 1998 in
Rome, Sicily and Sardinia and a new naval college will be set up
in Venice.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Asks Transparency in UN Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Parliament President
Ricardo Alarcon asked for transparency in the United Nations (UN)
Security Council here today.
</P>
<P>
Closing a seminar on the world organization which started
Tuesday, Alarcon said, the UN Security Council needs transparency
in its actions so as to comply with the UN charter.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Third World countries to revindicate the
democratization of the UN "as a necessary step to democratize
international relations."
</P>
<P>
Alarcon stated that the Security Council is not the general
staff of the big powers to dictate rules to other countries and
pinpointed the unilateral character of the United States foreign
policy which also appears inside the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the risks and challenges the world organization
must face, he said, the future of mankind is on the table as a
consequence of the present economic and commercial relations that
generate poverty and cause the depredation of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Permanent secretary of the Latin American Economic System
(Sela) Carlos Moneta, representatives of UNICEF, the FAO, and
other UN agencies took part in the seminar.

WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- About 80 percent of the

Friday aimed at forcing action on bills to overhaul campaign
finance rules.

lawmakers. However, the House Republican leaders opposed the
effort.
</P>
<P>
The petition will last through the two-year session of the 105th

to reach 218 this year.
</P>
<P>
Though their leaders supported it, more than a dozen of the 206
House Democrats were expected not to sign because they had pledged

ROME, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro today expressed opposition to "new privileges" in the
reform of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the
occasion of the U.N. Day, Scalfaro urged the world body to
consider an Italian proposal against the U.S. "quick fix" whereby
Germany, Japan and three Third World nations would get permanent
seats in the council.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that no reform can be "just and effective" unless
it rests on full equality between the member states, fair
geographical representation, and the full involvement of the
member states in the organization's "life and responsibilities".
</P>
<P>
Under the Italian proposal, the Security Council would be
enlarged with rotating members to make it more representative.
There would be no new permanent seats beyond the the United

<P>
MANAGUA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nicaraguan government will
exempt foreign investors from taxation in the country's power
industry, the Nicaraguan Energy Institute (INE) said today.
</P>
<P>
INE Minister Octavio Salinas said Nicaragua needs foreign
capital to meet the increasing demand of the future energy because
the country has neither state or private sector the capability to
invest in the power generation sector.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that if the country had to finance the
generation projects, it would have to raise the tariffs to a high
level.
</P>
<P>
He said priority would be given to energy generating plants, an
area in which some foreign investors have shown interest in
installing thermal and geothermal plants.
</P>
<P>
"We also want to attract people interest in generating energy
on the basis of agriculture waste products or energy forests, to
diminish the use of plants that use fuels," added Salinas.
</P>
<P>
The INE director said that United States, Europe, and South
America showed their interest in investing in the Nicaraguan
electricity sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, Oct 24 (Xinhua) -- The contribution of Panamanian
women to the country's economy reached 38 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The fact reflects their big participation in the Panamanian
economy, said the National Women Council (CNM) here today.
</P>
<P>
Technical CNM Secretary Urania Ungo highlighted the role women
have played in the country's socio-economic development before the
challenges presented by the globalization and the opening of the
Panamanian economy.
</P>
<P>
"A transformation and a massification of education is being
produced and women are adapting to the new production processes,
but there are obstacles related to the social structures that
prevent their full integration into the economy," said Ungo.
</P>
<P>
She said that to achieve a sustained development it is
necessasry to take into account women's participation, which now
suffers a salary inequality, where for every dollar earned by a
man, a woman obtains only 43 to 85 cents, according to the
productive activity.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need to make rights be respected and that the
international standards adopted by the International Labor
Organization (ILO) be followed by private enterprises and the
state," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ungo announced that in this aspect the Panamanian government is
trying, throug the CNM, to create consciousness of this inequality
so Agreements 100 and 111 related to the exercise of equality and
against discrimination are complied with. enditem

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Interviewed by U.S. Reporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to sign the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
after careful study, Chinese President Jiang Zemin announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
"Today I've authorized China's permanent representative to the
United Nations, Ambassador Qin Huasun, to sign on behalf of the
Chinese government the covenant at U.N. headquarters, as this move
demonstrates once again the government's staunch determination to
promote human rights' conditions in China and the world as a
whole," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
These remarks came before Jiang answered questions by a group
of Beijing-based U.S. reporters this morning, one day before he
leaves for a state visit to the U.S., the first by a Chinese head
of state in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Of his forthcoming visit, Jiang said, "I hope and believe that
my U.S. tour will produce important results through joint efforts
by both sides."
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Jiang said, he has met with President Clinton four
times and, during their first meeting in Seattle, he suggested
both sides should regard and handle Sino-U.S. relations from a
strategic and long-term perspective.
</P>
<P>
Ever since, bilateral relations have in general been moving
forward and, at present, this relationship has blossomed into an
opportunity for further improvement and development, he said,
adding that both nations share extensive common interests.
</P>
<P>
At the historic moment when a new century is drawing near, he
said, whether or not a healthy and stable Sino-U.S. relationship
can be brought into the 21st century concerns world peace,
stability and prosperity in the next century. Both nations share
in the important responsibility, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang disclosed that he will, together with President Bill
Clinton and other US leaders, discuss Sino-U.S. relations, promote
mutually beneficial cooperation in both bilateral and
international spheres, and move bilateral relations into a new
stage of development in line with the three joint communiques the
two nations have signed.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, he will also exchange views on his trip
with U.S. leaders on issues of common concern and on important
global and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Apart from talks and meetings in Washington, D.C., he will also
visit other U.S. cities to meet with a variety of people and get
in touch with the general public in an effort to "deepen mutual
understanding, enchance friendship and expand mutually beneficial
co-operation."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Greece, Turkey to Act in Restraint in Aegean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
on Friday urged both Greek and Turkish governments to act in a
"restrained and responsible manner" following an incident of
collision in the Aegean Sea on Wednesday between a Greek warship
and a Turkish submarine.
</P>
<P>
The incident, along with others, points up to the urgency and
importance of an initiative NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
raised to develop procedures to reduce tension and miscommunication
between Greek and Turkish forces, State Department spokesman Lee
McClenny said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly encourage Athens and Ankara to engage with the
secretary general to bring this initiative to fruition," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"These events also point to the value of direct communication
between Greece and Turkey to reduce misunderstandings and head
off problems before they arise," he added.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Becomes "Gene Bank" for Flora and Fauna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of a large
number of nature reserves has transformed Southwest China's Tibet
Autonomous Region into a natural "gene bank" and haven for wild
animals and plants.
</P>
<P>
Tibet, a region known as the "Roof of the World", is home to
nearly 6,900 types of wild plants, or the vast majority of major
species in the Northern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
The 125 rare animal species under state-level protection
account for a third of the total number of species in the region.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has established 13 nature reserves at or above the
regional level since 1985, with said reserves covering a total
area of 325,400 sq.km., an area larger than the total territory of
Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
A number of counties in the region have also established
smaller nature reserves.
</P>
<P>
The reserves are home to all rare animals and plants in the
region, according to regional government officials.
</P>
<P>
In addition to opening reserves, Tibet has also adopted special
regulations for animal and plant protection and has enhanced
conservation patrols during breeding seasons.
</P>
<P>
Related efforts have led to the rapid growth of many species.
</P>
<P>
Cyathea spinulosa, a rare plant which was plentiful as long as
135 million years ago, has disappeared in many areas around the
world, but can still be found in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Herds of rare animal species have grown by at least 20 percent
since the region established nature reserves, with the size of
some species growing by as much as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate for antelope, a species under first-rate state
protection, has grown by 12 percent. In addition, the wild yak
herd has grown to over 10,000 head, with the number of wild
donkeys growing to over 70,000 head. Red deer, once believed to
be extinct, are also found in the region.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Isolation of China is Wrong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today that isolating or containing China is wrong, and next
week's visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin will strengthen
U.S.-China relations and chart a course for future.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks in a major speech on China policy
since he became the president of the United States in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the headquarters of the the Voice of America,
Clinton said his meeting with Jiang offers "an opportunity and a
responsibility to chart a course toward a future that is more
positive and more stable, and hopefully more productive, than our
relations have been in the last few years."
</P>
<P>
"Next week, President Jiang and I will discuss our visions of
the future and the kind of strategic relationship We must have to
promote cooperation, not conflict," announced Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is due to start his one-week state visit to the United
States on October 26.
</P>
<P>
"China is a great country with a rich and proud history, and a
strong future," Clinton said, stressing China "will play a very
large role in shaping the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his strong opposition against isolating or
containing China. "Isolation of China is unworkable,
counterproductive and potentially dangerous," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is not containment and conflict; it is
cooperation," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The policy of isolation of China will "eliminate" cooperation
on weapons proliferation, "hinder our efforts to foster stability
in Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of "working with China and expanding
areas of cooperation, dealing forthrightly with our differences,"
Clinton said that he and Jiang would focus on six areas including
world and regional security issues, trade relations, and
environment protection cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"First, the United States has a profound interest in promoting
a peaceful, prosperous and stable world. Our task will be much
easier if China is a part of that process, not only playing by the
rules of international behavior, but helping to write and enforce
them," Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. also want China to be "a powerful force for
security and cooperation" in Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Jiang, Clinton said, he will reiterate
the America's continuing support for our one-China policy. "The
Taiwan question can only be settled by the Chinese themselves."
</P>
<P>
Other areas that the U.S. will focus on during the summit
include trade relations, environmental protection, weapons
proliferation, fighting drug trafficking and international
organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
Clinton applauded China's reforms and its efforts to crack down
against drugs and alien smuggling and said China was playing "an
increasingly constructive role" in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"As China opened its economy, its people have enjoyed greater
freedom of movement and choice of employment, better schools and
housing," said Clinton. "Today, most Chinese enjoy a higher
standard of living than at any time in China's modern history."
</P>
<P>
In the area of environment, Clinton said China has taken
important steps to deal with its needs for more energy and cleaner
air.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Refers UN Resolution to Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraq decided today to refer a
resolution adopted by the U.N. Security Council on disarmament
inspections to its parliament.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made today by the joint session of the
Revolutionary Command Council and the Regional Command of the
Arab Baath Socialist Party under President Saddam Hussein, the
official Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the meeting said that the session
reviewed the latest developments of the UN-imposed embargo
against Iraq after the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution
Thursday asking Iraq to strictly comply with the relevant U.N.
resolutions in order to evade extra sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted the resolution with the
approval of 10 states on top to which are the United States and
Britain and the abstention of other five members - Russia, China,
France, Egypt and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The resolution asks Iraq to fully cooperate with, and provide
all necessary transport and facilities to, the U.N. special
committee and its relevant inspection teams that supervise the
demilitarization of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "because of the lack of a clear chance
of getting the (U.N.) blockade lifted," the session decided "to
refer the subject to the parliament to study it thoroughly and
present its recommendations."

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Europe Should Use Economic Clout to Assert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian leader Yassir
Arafat today called on Europe to exert pressure on Israel through
economic means so as to rescue the peace process in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal while addressing members of the German
Society for Foreign Policy (DGAP) later today in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Though a major trading partner of Israel, Europe often saw its
attempts to mediate in the Mideast region rejected by Israel,
Arafat noted.
</P>
<P>
"I say that we must use this economic card positively, so that
Europe gets an effective role in the Middle East," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader in his speech criticized Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for reversing the Mideast peace
process, adding that "rescuing the peace process from this
dangerous crisis is an international affair."
</P>
<P>
Arafat is currently in Bonn for a two-day visit aimed at
getting more German economic assistance and a tougher German
stance regarding the current Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
A German government statement following his talks earlier today
with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that Kohl pledged that
Germany and the European Union would do everything in their power
to back the peace process in Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The statement however mentioned neither new German or EU
initiatives nor further German aid to Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat held talks with Kohl after a breakfast meeting with
parliamentary leader Rita Suessmuth, who, implying criticism of
Israel's blocking aid for the Palestinians, stressed in a
statement it was vital for international assistance to reach the
recipients in an "unbureaucratic manner without hindrance".
</P>
<P>
Arafat also had talks today with German Economics Minister
Guenter Rexrodt and Finance Minister Theo Waigel. He was expected
to meet Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader arrived in Bonn after a brief stopover
in Paris Thursday, where he voiced disappointment over result of
the recent U.S. mediated contacts with Israel and called for EU
help to push forward his negotiations with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S.-China Summit Charts Course for Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today that next week's visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin
will strengthen U.S.-China relations and chart a course for
future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the headquarters of the the Voice of America,
Clinton said that Jiang's visit offers "an opportunity and a
responsibility to chart a course toward a future that is more
positive and more stable, and hopefully more productive, than our
relations have been in the last few years."
</P>
<P>
"Next week, President Jiang and I will discuss our visions of
the future and the kind of strategic relationship we must have to
promote cooperation, not conflict," announced Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his strong opposition against isolating or
containing China. "Isolation of China is unworkable,
counterproductive and potentially dangerous," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is not containment and conflict; it is
cooperation," Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
The policy of isolation of China will "eliminate" cooperation
on weapons proliferation, "hinder our efforts to foster stability
in Asia."
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of "working with China and expanding
areas of cooperation, dealing forthrightly with our differences,"
Clinton said that he and Jiang would focus on six areas including
world and regional security issues, trade relations, and
environment protection cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"First, the United States has a profound interest in promoting
a peaceful, prosperous and stable world. Our task will be much
easier if China is a part of that process, not only playing by the
rules of international behavior, but helping to write and enforce
them," Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. also want China to be "a powerful force for
security and cooperation" in Asia.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Jiang, Clinton said, he will "reiterate
the America's continuing support for our one-China policy". "The
Taiwan question can only be settled by the Chinese themselves."
</P>
<P>
Other areas that the U.S. will focus on during the summit
include trade relations, environmental protection, weapons
proliferation, fighting drug trafficking and international
organized crimes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Trade Delegation Calls for Two-way Promotion Steps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Economic
and Trade delegation today called for two-way steps to promote the
Sino-American trade which jumped from less than 1 billion U.S.
dollars in 1978 to 42.8 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Delegation's leader Zeng Peiyan, who is also Executive Vice
Chairman of State Planning Commission, made the call in an address
at the luncheon hosted jointly by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
the U.S.-China Business Council and the National Association of
Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
He said the basic principle followed in the economic and trade
cooperation of both side is to maintain long-term and stable
Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations on the basis of further
consultation, supplementary and mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
In order to further tap the potentials of the Sino-American
economic and trade cooperation, Zeng proposed the two countries
take further measures which include:
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government would further open up its domestic
market, reduces the non-tariff barriers, and expand its import
from the U.S. while the U.S. government would ease its
restrictions on China's technological exports, settle the MFN
status of China in a proper way and the relevant issues concerning
the China's accession into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Zeng stressed the importance of strengthening the
mutual understanding and exchange between diverse sectors of both
countries. The Chinese side would make itself understand by the
American enterprises through improving the legal system, enhancing
the transparency of the policies and market. China would provide
the U.S. side with good conditions for the entry of its product,
technologies and resources while the United States would further
its efforts in entering China through upgrading the technical
quality of its products, its price competitiveness and service.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, efforts should be focused on diversifying the areas of
cooperation, Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to enhance the cooperation in the auto,
petrochemical and electronics industries. Cooperation will be
expanded in the fields of agriculture, environmental protection,
energy resources, the peaceful utility of nuclear energy,
aeronautics and aviation. More initiative will be pursued in the
sectors of banking, insurance, consultation and communications.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation leader also underlined increasing
patterns of the cooperation and exchanges. While strengthening the
cooperation in trade, investment and finance, he said, the scale
of the technological cooperation should be enlarged. More
discussions and contacts should be conducted between the
governmental agencies, enterprises, non-governmental organizations
and experts.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan also called on the U.S. side to strengthen the
cooperation and consultation in the multilateral organization such
as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and APEC.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived here this noon following their visit to
Los Angles and New York.

<HEADLINE> US Banks' Commercial Lending Reaches Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Commercial and industrial
lending by the largest U.S. banks reached a record high in the
past 12 months ending on September 30, a sign that they are
competing more aggressively than any time since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a statistics by the U.S. Federal Reserve, The Wall
Street Journal reported today that the commercial and industrial
lending by the largest U.S. banks has risen by 9.3 percent in the
past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The growth pushed the total C&AMP;L loans to 427.4 billion U.S.
dollars at the end of September, a record high.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the real-estate borrowing for commercial mortgages
at all U.S. banks has climbed by 7 percent in 12 months ending on
June 30. Commercial mortgages outstanding also reached a record
high of 388.6 billion dollars at the end of June, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that U.S. bank lenders, flush with cash and
eager to put it to work, are competing more aggressively than
any time since late 1980s, the last years before the 1990-1991
recession.
</P>
<P>
The catalyst for the revival of lending is the health of the
overall economy which is now on its seventh year of expansion.
</P>
<P>
But some analysts said that the lending mean U.S. banks are
getting overextented again now.
</P>
<P>
Goldman, Saches &AMP; Co analyst Robert Albertson noted that one
sign a business cycle may be starting to wind down is the bank
lending to corporations picks up just as growth in consumer
borrowing slows down -- both of which are happening now.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM's Scheduled Washington Trip in Doubt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy cast doubt today on his scheduled Washington trip to
hold talks with Palestinian chief negotiator Mahmoud Abbas.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Israeli Television, Levy said that he
is still waiting for clear instructions from Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on the government's position in the peace
making with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
He said that he needs clarification from Netanyahu about how to
conduct the negotiations before leaving for Washington.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached last month between Israel and the
PNA on resuming the peace talks, Levy and Abbas will conduct
further negotiations on implementing the interim agreements in
Washington late this month under the auspices of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Levy has often been at odds with the prime minister over the
responsibility for orchestrating the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Levy said that Netanyahu still has not found time to meet with
him to discuss Israeli plans to negotiate. He said that he would
not leave for Washington until Netanyahu agreed to see him.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local reports said that Netanyahu is trying to
arrange a summit meeting with United States President Bill
Clinton during his pending visit to Washington next month.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton, unsatisfied with Netanyahu's reluctance to accept
U.S. advices in handling the peace process, reportedly does not
want to meet him on the excuse of being occupied by prior
arrangements during his visit.
</P>
<P>
Since Netanyahu came to power last year, his hardline policies
have taken the peace process into constant crises, which has
become a headache of the U.S..
